Anantha Lakshmi,,,,,https://www.ft.com/content/ca3d43fa-4ef2-4e91-9d37-98c55e97fd84,"South-east Asia is rapidly growing as a critical link in global supply chains as manufacturers rush to shift production from China amid an escalating trade war.

He also vowed to phase out Indonesia’s coal plants by 2040.","South-east Asia is rapidly growing as a critical link in global supply chains as manufacturers rush to shift production from China amid an escalating trade war. It is also fast emerging as a focal point for new data centres as demand for AI surges.

Yet, as the economies attract billions of dollars in investments from the energy-consuming industries that are also increasingly demanding greener power, investment into renewables is sorely lacking.

South-east Asia accounts for only 2 per cent of global clean energy spending even though it accounts for 5 per cent of global energy demand, according to the International Energy Agency. For every dollar invested in fossil fuels in the region, about 80 cents go to clean energy — far lower than the global ratio of nearly 2:1 in favour of clean energy, the IEA says.

Indonesia, Vietnam and other countries in the region have set out ambitious climate targets — most want to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 — but there remains a massive investment gap. The region generates nearly three-quarters of its power from fossil fuels, and is still building new coal plants.

The IEA estimates south-east Asia will need to spend $190bn annually by 2030 to meet its climate goals — five times the current level.

The US withdrawal in March from a Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP), a multilateral climate financing programme that promised $45bn for three countries, has come as a much-needed reminder to south-east Asian countries that they cannot just rely on external financing. Indonesia and Vietnam are major recipients, along with South Africa.

“[JETP and other multilateral programmes] cannot be solely relied upon . . . which is why governments should focus on finding solutions that can catalyse private investments,” says Amy Kong, a researcher at Zero Carbon Analytics. She says multilateral financing, which has played a big role in climate financing in the region, is slowing as President Trump retreats from climate goals and reduces US aid globally, but bilateral public finance could help.

While the JETP and other multilateral agreements remain a viable source of funding, they offer a fraction of the investment needed. Experts say south-east Asian countries should undertake extensive policy reforms to create a conducive environment for investment in renewables.

“The private sector will be the main source of finance. However, they will not go in alone,” says Grant Hauber, strategic energy finance adviser for Asia at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. “What they need support for is the government policies and the fiscal environment that is created around those policies.”

Hauber says there is a mismatch between countries’ climate goals and policy frameworks that make renewable investments unviable.

Indonesia, the region’s biggest economy, is a good example. Last November, President Prabowo Subianto said Indonesia would achieve net zero emissions by 2050 — bringing forward an earlier target by 10 years. He also vowed to phase out Indonesia’s coal plants by 2040. The country is one of the world’s largest carbon emitters.

But Indonesia continues to allow new coal plants to be built. It also continues to impose a price ceiling on coal sold to power plants, essentially subsidising the fossil fuel and making it far cheaper than alternatives.

As a result, Indonesia has been one of the laggards in clean energy adoption. Government data shows investment in Indonesia’s renewable energy sector totalled $1.5bn in 2023, and it has stayed around the same level for the past six years.

“Indonesia is not competitive enough compared to the other countries based on the renewables capacity installed and policy developments,” says Shabrina Nadhila, Asia energy analyst at think-tank Ember. “The government needs to level the playing field for gas, coal and renewables.”

Indonesia’s energy minister Bahlil Lahadalia recently said Jakarta would retire coal plants early if it could get below-market loans from donors.

Other developing countries have also called for more concessional finance to speed energy transition. And, in fact, that has been one of the sticking points of the JETP programme.

JETP has been criticised by recipient countries for not offering enough grants or concessional loans, and relying too much on loans at market rates. Only a fraction of the promised funds has been disbursed so far.

However, despite the US withdrawal from the programme, other partner countries have promised to make it work. Germany stepped in immediately as the co-lead in the Indonesian JETP plan — the largest of the three at $20bn.

IEEFA’s Hauber said the US withdrawal could actually help JETP progress as US climate policies have recently prioritised oil and gas drilling, and increasing LNG exports. Its continued involvement may have led to delays, he says. “So if anything, a stumbling block has been removed with the US decision to leave.”

But south-east Asian governments still have to remove policy ambiguity and help the private sector.

Ember’s Shabrina says governments could offer guarantees, de-risking instruments or co-finance early stage projects for newer technologies to help draw private companies. “The bottom line is policy consistency and effective governance are key to building investor confidence,” she says.",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F7c20a615-83f4-4421-bfc5-f44d12cf5219.jpg?source=next-article&fit=scale-down&quality=highest&width=700&dpr=1,N,,2025-07-06 20:04:39.445578

Here's what you should know.

Solar & Clean Energy Credits Analysis

The biggest takeaway from this sector is the sooner-than-expected sunsetting of solar and clean energy tax credits. A full breakdown of our analysis can be found here, but a quick synopsis is below.

Solar and Wind Projects Face a Tighter Timeline: To qualify for tax credits, construction must start within a year of the bill’s passage and projects must be operational by the end of 2027—a major shift from prior deadlines.

Watch Out for Foreign Ties: Using equipment or funding linked to certain foreign entities could disqualify your project from receiving tax credits. The guidelines are still evolving, so careful sourcing and documentation are essential.

You Can Still Transfer Credits—With Caveats: The ability to sell or transfer tax credits remains intact, but transfers to prohibited foreign entities are off the table.

Home and EV Tax Breaks Ending Sooner: The popular residential solar and electric vehicle credits will also sunset earlier than expected—by late 2025—so planning ahead is key.

Compliance Just Got More Complicated: With longer audit windows and stricter penalties, it’s more important than ever to review documentation and update contracts to reflect the new legal landscape.

Business Taxation Analysis

From expanded incentives for community development and housing to new limitations on executive compensation and increased IRS enforcement, the bill touches nearly every corner of the business world. Below are some of the most impactful provisions, and you can read our full analysis here.

Opportunity Zones and Community Investment Incentives Expanded: The OBBB makes Opportunity Zones and New Markets Tax Credits permanent, in addition to enhanced benefits for rural areas—offering long-term tax planning opportunities for investors and developers in underserved communities.

Stronger Support for Housing and Construction Projects: Low-Income Housing Tax Credit limits are raised, and more residential construction projects qualify for favorable tax treatment—encouraging developers to revisit financing strategies.

Business Deductions Made Permanent and More Generous: The bill restores 100% bonus depreciation, makes the 20% Qualified Business Income deduction permanent, and reinstates more favorable interest deduction rules—providing valuable relief for both large and small businesses.

Greater Scrutiny for Executive Compensation and Nonprofits: New rules tighten deductions for executive pay over $1 million and expand excise taxes on nonprofit compensation and university endowments—requiring careful review of high-compensation arrangements and endowment funding.

Increased Compliance Burdens and IRS Enforcement Powers: With tighter limits on charitable deductions, permanent excess business loss rules, and expanded enforcement of COVID-relief penalties, businesses should expect greater IRS scrutiny and take steps now to manage compliance risk.

Estate Planning and Medicare Analysis

Changes in estate tax law, Medicaid policy, and long-term care funding make it critical to revisit and revise trusts, gifting strategies, and business succession plans. Here’s more of what you should know.

Estate and Gift Tax Exemption Increased: Beginning in 2026, the estate and gift tax exemption rises to $15 million for individuals and $30 million for married couples, permanently extending the higher thresholds first set by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Clients are encouraged to act quickly to take advantage of the exemption increases before potential future rollbacks by Congress.

Medicaid and Long-Term Care Eligibility Tightened: The OBBB imposes stricter scrutiny, new home equity limits, and more frequent eligibility checks—adding compliance burdens for those relying on public benefits.

Elimination of Reimbursements for Nonresidents: States will no longer receive federal reimbursements for providing medical assistance to nonresidents or individuals not lawfully in the U.S. after September 30, 2025.

Conclusion

The One Big Beautiful Bill represents a seismic shift in federal tax and entitlement policy, with far-reaching consequences for individuals, businesses, and nonprofit organizations. From accelerated clean energy credit deadlines to expanded business incentives and reduced public benefits for individuals, the legislation introduces both opportunities and compliance challenges. As the law takes effect, careful planning and proactive strategy will be essential.

Trump spoke for a relatively brief 22 minutes before signing the bill, but was clearly energized as the legislation’s passage topped a recent winning streak for his administration.
“Today, Donald Trump signed into law the worst job-killing bill in American history.
Upon his return to Washington early Friday, Trump described the package as “very popular,” though polling suggests that public opinion is mixed at best.","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump signed his package of tax breaks and spending cuts into law Friday in front of Fourth of July picnickers after his cajoling produced almost unanimous Republican support in Congress for the domestic priority that could cement his second-term legacy.

Flanked by Republican legislators and members of his Cabinet, Trump signed the multitrillion-dollar legislation at a desk on the White House driveway, then banged down a gavel gifted to him by House Speaker Mike Johnson that was used during the bill’s final passage Thursday.

Against odds that at times seemed improbable, Trump achieved his goal of celebrating a historic — and divisive — legislative victory in time for the nation’s birthday, which also was his self-imposed deadline for Congress to send the legislation to his desk. Fighter jets and stealth bombers streaked through the sky over the annual White House Fourth of July picnic.

“America’s winning, winning, winning like never before,” Trump said, noting last month’s bombing campaign against Iran’s nuclear program, which he said the flyover was meant to honor. “Promises made, promises kept, and we’ve kept them.”

The White House was hung with red, white and blue bunting for the Independence Day festivities. The U.S. Marine Band played patriotic marches — and, in a typical Trumpian touch, tunes by 1980s pop icons Chaka Khan and Huey Lewis. There were three separate flyovers.

Trump spoke for a relatively brief 22 minutes before signing the bill, but was clearly energized as the legislation’s passage topped a recent winning streak for his administration. That included the Iran campaign and a series of U.S. Supreme Court rulingshe’s fought for.

After dark, chants of “USA, USA” rose from the picnic crowd on the South Lawn when Trump and the first lady, Melania, appeared on the Truman Balcony to watch the fireworks. They danced to “Y.M.C.A.” and waved goodbye to the crowd before they left for their home in New Jersey.

The budget legislation is the president’s highest-profile win yet. It includes key campaign pledges like no tax on tips or Social Security income. Trump, who spent an unusual amount of time thanking individual Republican lawmakers who shepherded the measure through Congress, contended “our country is going to be a rocket ship, economically,” because of the legislation.

Big cuts to Medicaid and food stamps

Critics assailed the package as a giveaway to the rich that will rob millions more lower-income people of their health insurance, food assistance and financial stability.

“Today, Donald Trump signed into law the worst job-killing bill in American history. It will rip health care from 17 million workers to pay for massive tax giveaways to the wealthy and big corporations, amounting to the country’s largest money grab from the working class to the ultra-rich,” AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler said in a statement. “Every member of Congress who voted for this devastating bill picked the pockets of working people to hand billionaires a $5 trillion gift.”

The legislation extends Trump’s 2017 multitrillion-dollar tax cuts and cuts Medicaid and food stamps by $1.2 trillion. It provides for a massive increase in immigration enforcement. Congress’ nonpartisan scorekeeper projects that nearly 12 million more people will lose health insurance under the law.

The legislation passed the House on a largely party-line vote Thursday, culminating a monthslong push by the GOP to cram most of its legislative priorities into a single budget bill that could be enacted without Senate Democrats being able to block it indefinitely by filibustering.

It passed by a single vote in the Senate, where North Carolina Republican Thom Tillis announced he would not run for reelection after incurring Trump’s wrath in opposing it. Vance had to cast the tie-breaking vote.

In the House, where two Republicans voted against it, one, conservative maverick Tom Massie of Kentucky, has also become a target of Trump’s well-funded political operation. No Democrats voted for the bill.

The legislation amounts to a repudiation of the agendas of the past two Democratic presidents, Barack Obama and Joe Biden, in rolling back Obama’s Medicaid expansion under his signature health law and Biden’s tax credits for renewable energy.

The Congressional Budget Office estimates the package will add $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the decade and 11.8 million more people will go without health coverage.

Democrats vow to make bill a midterm issue

Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin on Friday called the bill “devastating” and said in a statement that Trump’s signature on the legislation “sealed the fate of the Republican Party, cementing them as the party for billionaires and special interests — not working families.”

He predicted Republicans would lose their majority in Congress over it. “This was a full betrayal of the American people,” Martin said.

Trump complained Friday about Democrats opposing the bill, “and we knew that because their hatred of either the country or me or both is so great they didn’t vote at all and it’s terrible.”

He said their “standard line” is to say Republican legislation is “dangerous” or “everybody’s going to die” and “we can’t let them get away with it.” With his bill, Trump said, “it’s actually just the opposite, everybody’s going to live.”

“And I just want you to know, if you see anything negative put out by Democrats, it’s all a con job,” Trump said, defending a package that now is law.

Speaking in Iowa on Thursday night, Trump said Democrats “hate Trump — but I hate them, too.”

The package is certain to be a flashpoint in next year’s midterm elections, and Democrats are making ambitious plans for rallies, voter registration drives, attack ads, bus tours and even a multiday vigil, all intended to highlight the most controversial elements.

Upon his return to Washington early Friday, Trump described the package as “very popular,” though polling suggests that public opinion is mixed at best.

For example, a Washington Post/Ipsos poll found that majorities of U.S. adults support increasing the annual child tax credit and eliminating taxes on earnings from tips, and about half support work requirements for some adults who receive Medicaid.

But the poll found majorities oppose reducing federal funding for food assistance to low-income families and spending about $45 billion to build and maintain migrant detention centers. About 60% said it was “unacceptable” that the bill is expected to increase the $36 trillion U.S. debt by more than $3 trillion over the next decade.",https://aldailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/AP25185785792402.jpg,N,,2025-07-06 20:05:08.712278

This story was originally published by Inside Climate News and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

The US Environmental Protection Agency placed 139 employees on administrative leave Thursday, an agency spokesperson confirmed, after they signed a “Stand Up for Science” petition using their official titles and EPA positions.

The affected employees received an email, shared with Inside Climate News, informing them that they are on leave through July 17, pending an investigation into whether they used work time or resources when signing the petition.

The email emphasizes that “this is not a disciplinary action.”

One employee, who asked not to be named, said they signed the petition “on a Sunday on my own device.”

“I’d be shocked if anyone used work resources,” the employee went on. “We’ve taken ethics training and are aware of the law.”

While the employees are on leave, they are prohibited from using government equipment, including cell phones, logging into government-issued computers, contacting any EPA employees for access to information, and performing any official EPA duties.

An EPA spokesperson wrote in an email that the agency “has a zero-tolerance policy for career bureaucrats unlawfully undermining, sabotaging, and undercutting the administration’s agenda as voted for by the great people of this country last November.”

The EPA also alleged that the petition contains misleading information, but did not specify what is incorrect.

The petition, addressed to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and members of Congress, is a “declaration of dissent” with the administration’s policies, “including those that undermine the EPA’s mission of protecting human health and the environment.”

“Since the Agency’s founding in 1970, EPA has accomplished this mission by leveraging science, funding, and expert staff in service to the American people,” the petition reads. “Today, we stand together in dissent against the current administration’s focus on harmful deregulation, mischaracterization of previous EPA actions, and disregard for scientific expertise.”

More than 200 EPA employees, including retirees, signed the petition, some of them only by initials. The document criticizes the agency for “undermining the public trust” by issuing misleading statements in press releases, such as referring to EPA grants as “green slush funds” and praising “clean coal as beautiful.”

The petition also accuses the administration of “ignoring scientific consensus to benefit polluters,” most notably regarding asbestos, mercury, and greenhouse gases.

Health-based regulatory standards are being repealed or reconsidered, including drinking water limits for four PFAS “forever chemicals” that cause cancer.

“The decisions of the current administration frequently contradict the peer-reviewed research and recommendations of Agency experts. Such contradiction undermines the EPA’s reputation as a trusted scientific authority. Make no mistake: your actions endanger public health and erode scientific progress—not only in America—but around the world.”

Signatories also lambasted the EPA for reversing progress on environmental justice, including the cancellation of billions of grant dollars to underserved communities and the removal of EJScreen, a mapping analysis tool that allowed the public to see pollution sources, neighborhood demographics, and health data.

The petition also opposes the dismantling of the Office of Research and Development, whose work forms the scientific basis for federal rulemaking.

Nicole Cantello is president of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) Union Local 704, and leader of AFGE Council 238, a nationwide union that represents over 8,000 EPA employees.

She said the EPA’s allegations are baseless.

“These are trumped-up charges against EPA employees because they made a political statement the Trump administration did not like,” Cantello said. “Now the Trump administration is retaliating against them.”

Cantello said the union will fight for the employees on several legal grounds, including First Amendment protections and employment contractual rights. “We’ll be using all of them to defend our people,” she said.

Matthew Tejada, the former director of the EPA’s environmental justice program and currently senior vice president of environmental health at the Natural Resources Defense Council, blasted the Trump administration for going after the EPA employees who signed the letter.

These civil servants, he said, were “totally within their rights” to speak out. “This is a public declaration by those employees that they continue to fight to do their jobs to help people across this country live healthier, safer, more prosperous lives,” Tejada said.

Tejada emphasized that the individuals involved were not working in coordination with advocacy groups, but acting independently in defense of the agency’s mission and the public interest.

He called the administration’s reaction “another indication that this administration is unique in modern times for having zero regard for the Constitution, for protecting and supporting the people of the United States.”

“We are in completely unprecedented waters here,” Tejada said.",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/07-06-25ClimateDeskPost.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-07-06 20:04:44.152700

In a rapidly urbanizing world, the value of green patches-whether parks, gardens, forests, or small vegetated areas or roads-has never been more significant. These patches of greenery, often overlooked amid skyscrapers and infrastructure, play a crucial role in maintaining environmental balance, enhancing public health, and improving the overall quality of life. They are the real engines of healthy environment. We go out for a walk but in absence of these, our all walk is futile. Nature has done a wonderful work by blessing the plants to produce oxygen and take away waste carbon dioxide from human beings and give us the life. The green patches have a number of benefits which we all know but what we do with these flora and fauna, is a suicidal act. I count a few of the benefits of green vegetation hereunder: –

Environmental Benefits: Green patches act as the lungs of cities and rural areas alike. They absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen, improving air quality and mitigating the effects of pollution. Trees and plants in these areas also reduce urban heat island effects by cooling surrounding areas through shade and evapotranspiration.

Moreover, green patches aid in biodiversity conservation by providing habitats for birds, insects, and other wildlife. Even small pockets of greenery can become vital refuges for native species, especially in heavily built-up environments.

Green spaces help in reducing air pollution: By absorbing the harmful gases, plants are then able to release oxygen into the atmosphere. Producing oxygen helps to combat the harmful effects of air pollution. By having green spaces in urbanized areas, plants and greenery are providing us with higher-quality air. The vegetation in green spaces has the effect of purifying air, and the vegetation generally reduces PM10,2.5 in three ways: deposition, retention, and adsorption. Studies have shown that trees in urban areas can reduce air PM10 concentration by 0.2-1.0% annually.

Water Management and Soil Protection: Vegetated areas help in managing storm water runoff. By allowing rainwater to infiltrate the ground, they reduce the burden on drainage systems and help recharge groundwater tables. The roots of plants also bind the soil, preventing erosion and maintaining land fertility.

Health and Well-being: Numerous studies have shown that exposure to green spaces reduces stress, enhances mood, and promotes physical activity. Parks and community gardens provide spaces for exercise, recreation, and social interaction-essential components of mental and physical health.Access to green patches has also been linked with lower rates of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, as well as improved cognitive development in children.

Aesthetic and Economic Value: Green spaces enhance the beauty of any landscape. They increase the aesthetic appeal of neighborhoods and can even raise property values. In commercial areas, well-maintained green patches attract more visitors and encourage longer stays, boosting local economies.

Climate Resilience: As the climate crisis intensifies, green patches serve as buffers against extreme weather. They provide shade during heatwaves, reduce flood risk during heavy rainfall, and help sequester carbon. Their role in making cities more resilient to climate change is both immediate and long-term.

Keeping us calm: Some scientists and researchers also believe that because our eyes are at the peak of their perception to detect the wavelengths corresponding with the color green, the shade may calm us down. With less strain to perceive the colors, our nervous system can relax when perceiving the tone.

This sedative quality of green may explain why there is so much of it in hospitals, schools and work environments. Historically, actors and actresses would recess to green rooms after so much time looking into bright lights on stage, though modern “green rooms” are rarely painted green.

After the eight-year study was completed, the data revealed that participants who lived in the greenest areas had a 12% lower death rate than women living in the least green areas. With more green space, study authors said, came more opportunity to socialize outdoors. Additionally, the natural settings – compared with residential regions where plants and greenery were sparse – proved to be beneficial to mental health.

“We were surprised at the magnitude of the mental health pathway,” said Peter James, study author and research associate at the Harvard Chan School’s Department of Epidemiology. Of those who did not live in greener areas, respiratory issues were the second highest cause of death. The study indicated that less exposure to polluted air may have been one of several reasons for increased life expectancy among those who lived in green areas.

Our ancestors lived their entire lives outdoors. The benefits we stand to gain from adopting an outdoor mindset could have a positive impact. “We know already that vegetation can help mitigate the effect of climate change. Green patches are more than just visual relief from concrete-they are vital for a sustainable and healthy future. Urban planners, governments, and communities must prioritize the preservation and expansion of green spaces. Whether through rooftop gardens, tree-lined streets, or protected natural reserves, every effort counts toward creating a livable planet for future generations. Think, what we are doing today, scrapping all vegetation and green patches in the name of development. Is this sustainable development? is the question. Everywhere huge mega projects of road work and infrastructure is coming up, damaging and removing the green belt. How can we justify all these? The deployment at the risk of human lives cannot be accepted. What is use fun of the development when generations will have to pay with their lives.",https://cdndailyexcelsior.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/naturer.jpg,N,,2025-07-06 20:04:58.195070

As rescue crews continue their frantic search for missing children along the Guadalupe River, experts warn that similar incidents could continue to happen as the federal government slashes funding for weather forecasting, shutters climate websites and databases, lays off scientists and researchers and weakens disaster response capabilities at a moment when climate change is increasing the frequency of such events.

That includes California, where the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and its subsidiary, the National Weather Service, are reeling from cutbacks ordered by the Trump administration. In May, at least two California offices of the NWS said they no longer have enough staff to operate overnight: Hanford and Sacramento, which together cover nearly all of the Central Valley and Sierra Nevada mountains, some of the state’s most fire-and-flood-prone areas.

Nationally, more than 600 scientists and meteorologists have already been laid off or taken a buyout from NOAA this year. The Trump administration is planning to cut thousands more employees next year — approximately 17% of its workforce — and slash the agency’s budget by more than $1.5 billion, according to the fiscal 2026 budget request. The president has said the changes will help reduce federal waste and save taxpayers money.

Yet these and other changes come as human-caused climate change contributes to larger and more frequent floods, wildfires and hurricanes, among other worsening disasters. The Texas flood, in particular, was marked by the type of extremely intense, highly localized downpour that is becoming much more common due to global warming. Portions of the Guadalupe River rose 26 feet in less than an hour, state officials said.

“This is one of the hardest things to predict that’s becoming worse faster than almost anything else in a warming climate, and it’s at a moment where we’re defunding the ability of meteorologists and emergency managers to coordinate,” said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist with the University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources. “That trifecta seems like a recipe for disaster.”

Indeed, just how frequently such events occur will soon become harder to tell, as the Trump administration has already eliminated NOAA’s database for tracking billion-dollar disasters. Its last update before the shutdown confirmed that there were 27 weather and climate disasters with losses exceeding $1 billion each in the United States in 2024. In the 1980s, the nation averaged just 3.3 such events per year, adjusted for inflation, the database shows.

The administration last week shut down the U.S. Global Change Research Program’s website, which housed congressionally mandated reports and research on climate change. Meanwhile, the weather service has begun halting weather balloon operations at multiple locations due to staffing shortages, reducing the amount of data that’s available.

Details about the Texas incident are still unfolding. Some state officials were quick to point the finger at the National Weather Service — including Texas Division of Emergency Management Chief Nim Kidd, who said forecasts did not adequately predict the amount of rain that fell on the area.

Agency officials said they did their job — issuing multiple warnings in advance of the incident, including some that advised of potentially catastrophic conditions. A timeline provided to The Times by the National Weather Service indicated that an expanded flood hazard outlook was issued on the morning of July 3, and that multiple, increasingly urgent alerts followed.

“The National Weather Service is heartbroken by the tragic loss of life in Kerr County,” agency spokesperson Erica Grow Cei said in an email, adding that the NWS “remains committed to our mission to serve the American public through our forecasts and decision support services.”

However, the local area office was also short several key positions, including a senior hydrologist, staff forecaster and meteorologist in charge, the New York Times reported Sunday. Also absent was the office’s warning coordination meteorologist — the person who acts as the liaison between the weather service and the public and emergency management officials — who took Trump’s buyout earlier this year.

On Sunday, Texas Rep. Joaquin Castro called for an investigation into whether staffing shortages at the agency played a role, telling CNN’s “State of the Union” that “not having enough personnel is never helpful.”

In a statement, the White House did not address staff reductions but said no funding cuts have yet occurred at the National Weather Service.

“The timely and accurate forecasts and alerts for Texas this weekend prove that the NWS remains fully capable of carrying out its critical mission,” a spokesperson from the U.S. Commerce Department, which oversees NOAA, said in an email.

While the precise circumstances that surrounded the Texas tragedy will continue to be studied in the days and weeks ahead, experts say it is clear that such climate hazards will continue to happen.

“With a warmer atmosphere, there is no doubt that we have seen an increase in the frequency and the magnitude of flash flooding events globally,” said Jonathan Porter, chief meteorologist with AccuWeather.

Porter credited the weather service with issuing warnings in advance of the flash flood, but said there was a breakdown when it came to local officials’ response to the information.

“The key question is, what did people do with those warnings that were timely, that were issued?” Porter said. “What was their reaction, what was their weather safety plan, and then what actions did they take to based upon those timely warnings, in order to ensure that people’s lives were saved?”

Yet even efforts to enhance coordination between the weather service, the government and the general public could soon be on the chopping block. NOAA has been researching better ways to communicate disaster warnings, including improved public education and early warning systems, at its Oceanic and Atmospheric Research division, which is facing a hefty 74% budget cut if not complete elimination.

The president’s proposed 2026 budget would also reduce funding for specialized, high-resolution thunderstorm models that have been developed for just this type of event, according to Swain of UC ANR. He noted that it’s an area of research that was pioneered by the U.S. government, in large part because the country has some of the most extreme thunderstorm weather in the world.

“Nearly all of the research in the world, historically, toward understanding these types of storms and predicting them has been sponsored by the U.S. federal government, and nearly all the advances we have made have been U.S. taxpayer-dollar funded,” Swain said. “Other countries aren’t going to do that on behalf of the U.S. ... So if we don’t do it for ourselves, we aren’t going to have access to that.”

The Texas flood “is representative of precisely the kind of nightmare scenario that is going to become more likely with the further extreme cuts that are proposed, and likely to be implemented to some degree,” he added.

Notably, the changes at NOAA and the NWS are meeting with other new priorities from the president, including a renewed investment in oil and gas drilling — fossil fuel industries that are among the top contributors to global warming.

In southeastern states such as Florida, officials are also grappling with reduced hurricane forecasting capabilities at the height of hurricane season.

And in California, where multiple wildfires are currently burning, state officials are also facing reduced firefighting capabilities as Trump deploys National Guard firefighting troops in Los Angeles and reduced forest management and firefighting staffing at the U.S. Forest Service.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f009154/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7743x4065+0+548/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa2%2Fab%2F0890b477424ba1ace523bee577ab%2Fap25187625454653.jpg,N,,2025-07-06 20:05:11.589457

Critics of federal EV charging infrastructure funding say that it took too long for states to act on the federal opportunity.
Actually, the time delay in EV charging infrastructure rests in designs and approvals to be finalized.
Reports of recent EV charging mishaps are highly exaggerated.
But we in the EV world have high expectations for EV charging as the future becomes now.","The convenience of home charging is an enormous benefit to battery-electric vehicle drivers. Of course, most of us who own an electric vehicle also drive far from home, and that’s where EV charging has proven to be a bit tricky and occasionally downright frustrating in past years.

Let’s be honest. Unless you had a Tesla and could tap into the Supercharger network, you’d expect broken chargers. Weird adapters required. Cars parked in the rare EV charging space for hours — and hours and hours. Oversized e-trucks blocking other charger space access. Locating a charger behind a car dealership, only to find it disabled.

But that was then; this is now. In the first three months of 2025, overall failure rates fell to 16%, the biggest improvement since the surveys began in 2021, according to JD Power. This summer, more EV drivers than ever will be able to charge without mishap on their lovely scenic road trips.

Could the days of fear of EV charging (FOEVC) be behind us?

Did you know there were about 55,200 fast chargers in the US in May, up from 42,200 just a year earlier? Those numbers come from the Alternative Fuels Data Center. These EV charging ports are designed to minimize downtime and maximize efficiency, allowing vehicles to quickly complete one task and move on to the next without significant delays.

The North American Charging Standard, developed by Tesla, now offers a further advantage of slimmer, lighter handles that are easier to plug into cars. Automakers are updating their cars so ports fit a lot more EV charging infrastructure; that allows drivers to recharge more quickly and get back on the road. And EV charging companies are building new stations.

In 2024, more than 1.3 million public charging points were added around the globe, representing an increase of more than 30% compared to the previous year. The charging points added in 2024 alone were approximately equal to the total number of points available in 2020. (It’s important to note that about two-thirds of that growth in public chargers has occurred in China.)

If Charging is Getting Good, Then Why are Fewer Drivers Thinking about EV Adoption?

The June 3 AAA EV survey reported that only 16% of US adults reported being “very likely” or “likely” to purchase a fully electric vehicle (EV) as their next car, the lowest percentage recorded of EV interest since 2019. The percentage of consumers indicated they would be “unlikely” or “very unlikely” to purchase an EV rose from 51% to 63%, the highest since 2022. These low satisfaction rates were despite the wide variety of electric vehicle models now available — over 75 options introduced in the past four years.

However, the primary reasons for buying EVs didn’t change in the AAA survey responses: gas savings, environmental concerns, and an appreciation for the lower maintenance costs associated with EVs.

Despite advancements in the EV industry and the growing availability of models, public perception regarding EV charging remains uncertain. Most people don’t know that they could be saving hundreds of dollars each year by switching to an EV. And why not? The corrupt Trump administration has done all it can to decimate EV expansion and reinvigorate the fossil fuel industry.

The US National EV Infrastructure program, part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that was passed in 2021, allocated $5 billion to fund fast chargers along corridors. By the end of 2024 about $30 million had been spent on charging points that are now in operation. Critics of federal EV charging infrastructure funding say that it took too long for states to act on the federal opportunity.

Actually, the time delay in EV charging infrastructure rests in designs and approvals to be finalized. Once contracts are signed by all parties, permits are lined up, and hardware is delivered, construction only takes a couple of weeks. New EV charging facilities can be up and running very quickly once the behind-the-scenes work is done.

Nonetheless, in January 2025, Executive Order 14154 paused the disbursement of funds for a review of the processes, policies, and programs associated with EV charging grant selections, making future disbursements of the remaining unspent funds uncertain. The Big Bad Budget Bill ended up cutting the EV tax credits, with the last day to participate on September 30, 2025.

Electric vehicles continue to sell, regardless of clickbait-inspiring headlines and regressive political leaders. After all, transportation electrification is too important. US drivers indicate that they’ll be purchasing more than 100,000 secondhand EVs in the second quarter, according to preliminary estimates from Cox Automotive. Used EV sales are set to shoot up 27% from the first quarter and surge 45% year-on-year.

Motivations behind EV Adoption and Skepticism

Academics emphasize the importance of identifying motivations in public behavior. Various motivations can influence individual attitudes, such as the need for security, stability, achievement, social status, social justice, and a sense of responsibility for the future. The Trump administration has fed into a narrative in which to belong means to adhere to MAGA values.

Men, particularly, seem to be susceptible to the confluence of Trump condemnation of EVs and traditional masculine identity. Negative male attitudes toward EVs and reluctance to purchase EVs are consistent with masculinity contingency, which is a measure designed to assess the extent that a man’s self-worth is derived from his sense of masculinity. Less favorable attitudes about EVs, lower intention to purchase EVs, and higher likelihood of rating EVs as the least-preferred new vehicle purchase option seem connected to identity self-reflection.

Yes, misinformation and disinformation has blurred what could have been an exponential rise in EV adoption, but, as our CleanTechnica colleague Jake Richardson explains, electric vehicles are too “critical for human health and the environment to be shut down.” Scientific evidence, reasoning, logic, and facts point to the long-term adoption of EVs and an eventual ubiquitous EV charging infrastructure.

Final Thoughts about EV Charging

The turbulence in Washington reinforces the value of Generation180’s ​“I’ll Drive What She’s Driving” campaign. Policy can be very fragile, but trusted messengers and the clean energy constituencies that the non-profit is building is intended to have real staying power — regardless of who’s in power in Washington.

EVs have the lowest fuel cost of any vehicle type, based on a national average electricity price of 15.9 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh). EVs also have the lowest maintenance costs among all models. Wondering which US state offers the best EV charging? It’s Massachusetts, with the most charging ports and EV stations.

Reports of recent EV charging mishaps are highly exaggerated. Yes, dealers have yet to create their lots as welcoming spaces for charging. Sure, it could mean that only their customers may have permission to charge, but other businesses have created incentives that cultivate their customer base in similar ways. But we in the EV world have high expectations for EV charging as the future becomes now.

It would help a lot of people if the media would take time to chronicle people like me and you who love their EVs and who find EV charging to be generally smooth and carefree.

The conference committee budget settled on $20 million, and then Healey vetoed it down to $10 million.","BOSTON (SHNS) – On the same day President Donald Trump signed a landmark domestic policy bill that will reshape state finances for years to come, Gov. Maura Healey approved a $60.9 billion annual budget and rolled out a companion proposal designed to empower her administration with greater cost-cutting power.

Healey on Friday signed the fiscal year 2026 budget lawmakers sent her on Monday, in the process vetoing $130 million in planned spending amid crystallizing concerns that federal funding to Massachusetts will drop and the state may face new costs in a world where the so-called “big, beautiful bill” is the law of the land.

Between her spending cuts and changes that legislative negotiators made to cushion against financial strain, the final budget that became law — which is packed with big funding boosts for health care, education and transportation plus policy measures like a limit on renter-paid broker fees — raises spending by more than 5% but is more than $1 billion smaller than the version Healey filed in January, before the federal bill emerged.

The governor and her deputies will pursue other steps to further buttress against budgetary impacts from economic downturn or federal funding cuts, especially to the massive and costly Medicaid insurance program.

Officials announced Friday that an executive branch hiring freeze implemented in May will remain in effect for the duration of fiscal year 2026, which runs through next June. The administration will also scrap a 2% raise for thousands of executive branch managers set to start in January, which officials said would save $17 million.

While Healey did not veto any of the earmarks lawmakers wrote into the budget to support projects and programs in their districts, the administration will delay paying about $125 million of those until at least the fall. Administration and Finance Secretary Matthew Gorzkowicz said if the state is in a precarious fiscal position at that point, everything will be on the table, including cancellation of earmarks.

Some of the governor’s biggest new plans to control state spending will need buy-in from the Legislature.

Healey on Friday filed a new $130 million supplemental budget bill that her office said would create a $100 million “flexible pool of resources” that the administration could tap later in the year to deal with “changing economic conditions and federal spending decisions.” The other $30 million would go toward a housing preservation and stabilization fund, which Gorzkowicz said would provide resources to housing programs amid concerns about safety-net impacts from new federal policy.

That bill would also grant the administration the ability to transfer some line-item spending between agencies and use capital dollars instead of operating dollars to pay for some Department of Transportation workers. The governor is also asking for new authority that might prove unpalatable to some lawmakers: a limited-time ability to cut spending unilaterally from the entire state budget.

The existing state law limits a governor’s power to trim spending midway through the year only to the executive branch, which according to Gorzkowicz makes up roughly 55% to 60% of the budget. Other areas like quasi-public agencies, local aid, retirement and other post-employment benefits, and debt service cannot be targeted by what are commonly known as “9C cuts.”

Gorzkowicz said the new supplemental budget would, only in fiscal year 2026, allow the administration to trim from anywhere if revenue collections fall at least $400 million below projected benchmarks or if federal policy changes cost the state budget $400 million or more.

Officials are still sifting through the federal megabill, which the U.S. House approved Thursday and Trump plans to sign Friday, to determine its full impacts on state budgeting. Gorzkowicz said he hopes to have a better understanding in roughly a month.

A preliminary estimate from health policy nonprofit KFF suggested the Medicaid changes could cost Massachusetts $15 billion to $25 billion over the next decade.

Another outside section to Healey’s new bill would grant the state Department of Public Health the ability to set the schedule for childhood vaccines instead of relying on recommendations from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices — a panel that U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy completely reshaped last month.

The timing of Healey’s budget signature is unusual in two ways: she announced the action on a federal holiday that created a long weekend, and she acted more quickly on an annual budget than any Massachusetts governor in at least 25 years.

For every other annual budget since fiscal 2001, at least seven days elapsed between the final Senate enactment vote and the governor’s response, according to data tracked by the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation.

Gorzkowicz said the administration wanted to move rapidly on the budget because lawmakers sent it to Healey before the July 1 start of the fiscal year for the first time since 2016.

In another unusual move, Healey does not plan any press conference to discuss her budget actions. The only public event on her schedule Friday is attending the Boston Pops Fireworks Spectacular on the Charles River Esplanade in the evening.

“I’m proud to sign a budget that is fiscally responsible and protects what makes Massachusetts special,” Healey said in a statement. “I’m grateful to the Legislature for their strong partnership and efficient work to develop and pass this budget for the people we serve. In Massachusetts, we are continuing to lead and do what we know works – focusing on lowering costs, protecting essential care and services, and moving our economy forward by investing in housing, transportation and our schools.”

“We are also signing this budget in a moment of great dysfunction in Washington,” she added. “The President is poised to sign a bill that’s going to kick hundreds of thousands of Massachusetts residents off their health care, increase energy and groceries prices, and cost people their jobs.”

In a social media post the day before she announced her action on the budget, Healey touted her approach to state spending as a contrast with the incoming federal law.

“We want you to have access to health care, to education, transportation,” Healey said. “I want you to be able to afford groceries, housing, heat and electricity. That’s what we’re focused on delivering.”

The fiscal 2026 budget increases state spending just shy of 5.4% over the spending bill Healey signed last summer. Some of that increase is driven by the use of $2.4 billion in revenue from the voter-approved surtax on high earners, which will fund major investments in K-12 schools, early education and care grants, operating support for the MBTA and regional transit authorities.

Healey vetoed a combined $130 million from 28 line items, less than the $248 million net spending she struck from last year’s budget and the $205 million net spending she eliminated the year before.

A $27.5 million reduction this time around pairs with a directive Healey issued to the Group Insurance Commission to eliminate coverage of GLP-1 weight loss drugs for state employees unless medically necessary. Officials said that change would more closely match private health insurance, where several plans have called out the increasingly popular drugs as major cost drivers.

Healey also cut $10 million from the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center, according to Sen. Michael Barrett, the Senate’s point person for energy and climate policy and the chairman whose committee is reviewing Healey’s energy affordability legislation.

The governor originally proposed a $30 million outlay for MassCEC. The conference committee budget settled on $20 million, and then Healey vetoed it down to $10 million.

Barrett said the additional change hinders clean tech at a time when it is talked about as a cornerstone of the state’s economy for decades to come and threatens the state’s readiness for a post-Trump era.

“I don’t quite see how it all computes and I’m astounded. I feel that Massachusetts is sending a very weird signal out into the world,” Barrett said. “We’re not going to see any clean energy progress on the federal front and now we’re doing something that would have the effect of doubling the federal assault.”

An official said Friday afternoon that the administration will use $10 million from an Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs trust fund to bring MassCEC funding to a combined $20 million after the veto.

Lawmakers have the power to override any of the governor’s vetoes with a two-thirds vote in each chamber.

Healey also returned two outside sections of the budget with amendments, one seeking a technical change and the other proposed to study, not implement, a mandatory retirement savings program for employees who lack access to such programs through their workplaces.

That Secure Choice Savings Program had drawn criticism from the National Federation of Independent Business both when the House quietly added it via amendment and when the provision survived conference committee negotiations.

In a letter to lawmakers alongside her amendment, Healey said she believes “further consideration of the proposal is warranted.”

“Saving for retirement is an important goal, but there are many ways to encourage this behavior. This proposal has invited feedback from various groups who, while supportive of the goal of expanding access to retirement saving, suggest there are additional implementation questions that need to be resolved prior to enactment,” Healey wrote. “These implementation questions should be answered before we establish a new statewide program and obligation on Massachusetts employers.”

Legislative negotiators built some flexibility into the final state budget bill they shipped Healey, aiming to strike a balance between Democrats’ appetite for significant spending on state services and the prospect of federal funding cuts.

They trimmed the bottom line hundreds of millions of dollars below the original House- and Senate-approved versions, incorporated nearly half a billion extra surtax dollars, and left about $800 million in anticipated revenues unappropriated as a cushion against future impacts.

House budget chief Aaron Michlewitz called the legislative budget “not only [a bill] that will allow our economy to grow, but will also do this while maintaining the Legislature’s commitment to fiscal stability [and] sustainability.”

“Some have said that this piece of legislation is actually the real ‘big, beautiful bill’ being taken up this week,” Michlewitz said Monday while introducing the accord. “Unlike the one in Washington, this piece of legislation is one that will not hurt our residents, but will help improve the lives of all our constituents, not just the ones with the largest paychecks.”

Gorzkowicz said the administration has spoken with budget chiefs in the House and Senate about convening a hearing in the fall with economists to examine the state’s financial footing and whether officials need to revise their tax collection estimates for fiscal 2026.

The secretary by law must certify by Oct. 15 that the state has sufficient revenues to fulfill expenditures, and he said that deadline will be a key early milestone.

Healey’s office provided written quotes about the budget from House Speaker Ron Mariano and Senate President Karen Spilka thanking the governor for her signature.

“This FY26 budget makes key investments that better support Massachusetts students and families, that increase access to affordable health care, and that provide for a safer and more reliable public transportation system – all without raising taxes,” Mariano said. “In a moment of incredible uncertainty at the federal level, this budget is proof that government can be both fiscally responsible and an agent of good, the kind of government that our residents deserve.”

Added Spilka, “In Massachusetts, we know that the best investment we can make is in our people, and this budget reflects the Senate’s continuing commitment to do so while maintaining our equal commitment to responsible money management. This statewide approach to investment delivers resources to every part of the state and protects our most vulnerable residents from the cruelest actions of the federal government, while our continued focus on education and mental health ensures that people have they keys to unlock the doors of opportunity.”",https://www.wwlp.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/07/statehousenews-45.png?w=1280,N,,2025-07-06 19:05:16.423927

Slate Price Slated Now for Mid $20,000’s

Slate Auto’s minimalist electric pickup which many considered would be the only American-made EV priced “under \$20,000 will now cost buyers in the “mid-twenties.” The sharp price increase is triggered by the repeal of federal EV tax credits.

The price hike follows the passage of former President Donald Trump’s new energy bill, which eliminates the \$7,500 federal incentive for electric vehicles starting September 30, 2025.

Originally a key marketing hook for the Indiana-built truck—known for its stripped-down design without paint, stereo, or touchscreen—the low price was only achievable with the credit factored in.

The startup, backed by Jeff Bezos, updated its website just days ago, replacing its bold price promise with more tempered language.

Totally Solar Vehicle Charging In Lost Hills Found to Be Open

Tesla has unveiled a groundbreaking new charging site in Lost Hills, California, featuring 168 Supercharger stalls and an impressive 11 megawatts of solar power supported by 10 Tesla Megapacks. Constructed in just eight months, this massive site sets a new standard for sustainable EV infrastructure. Currently, 84 stalls are open and fully operational—powered entirely by solar energy and functioning completely off-grid. The remaining stalls and an on-site lounge are set to open later this year, offering even more convenience for travelers. Tesla celebrated the launch with a nod to safe and sustainable Fourth of July travel.

Nexperia 1st ESD Diodes for 48V Automotive Data

Nexperia introduced the first electrostatic discharge (ESD) diodes specifically designed to protect 48V automotive data communication networks, addressing a critical gap in protection for evolving EV and HEV architectures. The new portfolio includes six AEC-Q101 qualified diodes with reverse working voltages of 54V, 60V, and 72V, providing robust ESD protection while maintaining signal integrity at higher data rates. Housed in compact SOT23 packages and offering ultra-low capacitance (as low as 3.4 pF), these components help designers save PCB space and costs. Previously, manufacturers resorted to complex workarounds for ESD protection on 48V lines, but this new solution enables streamlined, high-performance protection for legacy protocols like CAN, CAN-FD, LIN, and FlexRay in modern EVs and HEVs.

In Race for EV Adoption, China Leads

As battery electric vehicles (BEVs) reach a plateau of technological parity around the world, the factors driving their success are shifting from engineering feats to policy frameworks, infrastructure availability, and brand trust. That’s the key takeaway from the 2025 E-Mobility Attractiveness Index, released jointly by consulting firm BearingPoint and the Handelsblatt Research Institute.

For the first time, the index compares the four most significant BEV markets — China, the United States, Germany, and France — combining objective data and consumer surveys to assess how attractive each country is for EV adoption.

China Sets the Pace

With a leading score of 133.5 (baseline 100), China topped the index, driven by state-backed industrial policy, low-cost electricity, and a dense network of charging stations. The United States followed with 114.4, ahead of Germany (108.4) and France (94.6).

According to Sven Jung, Director of Economic Analysis at the Handelsblatt Research Institute, China’s lead is rooted in “years of strategic government support, protection of domestic players, and a coordinated approach to infrastructure and innovation.” Still, Jung cautions, the lead is “not insurmountable” if other nations act decisively.

Charging Is the New Battleground

With technical differences in range, consumption, and charging speeds narrowing across global EV models, infrastructure — not hardware — now defines everyday usability. China and Germany have built out robust public charging networks that extend into rural areas, while the U.S. and France continue to struggle with gaps, especially in regions lacking private charging access.

“To move e-mobility from niche to mainstream, drivers must be able to forget where the chargers are,” said Jung. “And when they do need one, it should be fast enough not to interrupt their day.”

Policy: The Hidden Hand Behind Price

While cost remains a major barrier to BEV adoption, the report underscores how much of that cost is policy-driven. Chinese consumers benefit from generous subsidies and low-cost energy. In Germany, the removal of purchase incentives and high electricity rates have made BEVs less appealing.

European policymakers, the study notes, have an opportunity to reclaim momentum by reinstating targeted incentives, regulating electricity prices for EV owners, and accelerating investment in local battery and semiconductor production.

“Getting to mass adoption isn’t about just building better cars,” said Manuel Schuler, BearingPoint’s Global Leader for Automotive and Industrial Manufacturing. “It’s about governments creating an ecosystem where price, infrastructure, and power all align.”

Trust: The Intangible Advantage

Though often overlooked, consumer trust — especially brand loyalty — emerged as a critical differentiator. In each country, local brands scored highest: BYD in China, Renault in France, Volkswagen in Germany, and Tesla in the U.S. Yet these same brands often struggle abroad, particularly Chinese automakers, who face persistent skepticism in European markets despite competitive products.

BYD earned the highest brand-specific score in the index at 155.9, yet Schuler notes that without a stronger presence and clearer brand identity overseas, Chinese OEMs may continue to fall short of their global ambitions.

“They have the tech,” he said. “But winning hearts and wallets abroad requires more than just specs — it takes commitment, pricing, and a locally attuned brand strategy.”

About the Index

Originally launched in Germany in 2024, the E-Mobility Attractiveness Index evaluates how appealing BEVs are to consumers in terms of infrastructure, affordability, policy incentives, and brand trust. The 2025 edition is the first to expand internationally.

The sedan will be available in a number of trim levels, including the performance flagship i3 M60 xDrive, as well as the i3 20, i3 40, i3 40 xDrive, i3 50, and i3 50 xDrive.
All of this suggests that BMW might just be gearing up to capture a sizable portion of the premium electric sedan market, potentially coming for the Tesla Model 3.
Out of all the trims, it is the i3 M60 xDrive, which is expected to go toe to toe with the Tesla Model 3 Performance.
Based on current i3 models, I can see the i3 being priced competitively in the premium sedan segment, likely starting around US$50,000 based on current i3 models.","BMW is working on introducing a new 3 Series that will include a standalone electric vehicle called the i3, alongside the standard ICE and plug-in hybrid models. And unlike the oddball carbon-fiber hatchback that was once known by that name, the next-generation electric i3 is set to be an out-and-out sedan.

It will be built on the long-awaited Neue Klasse dedicated EV platform, and is slated to go into production at the automaker's Munich facility in July 2026, paving the way for an early 2027 debut.

The 2027 BMW i3, code-named NA0, will be built with the company's latest motor and battery technology. The sedan will be available in a number of trim levels, including the performance flagship i3 M60 xDrive, as well as the i3 20, i3 40, i3 40 xDrive, i3 50, and i3 50 xDrive. All of this suggests that BMW might just be gearing up to capture a sizable portion of the premium electric sedan market, potentially coming for the Tesla Model 3.

This information comes from the highly reliable Bimmerpost forum, and interestingly, the production schedules, along with anticipated grades and options for the i3 and iM3, tie in with what BMW has previously revealed.

Out of all the trims, it is the i3 M60 xDrive, which is expected to go toe to toe with the Tesla Model 3 Performance. It will likely produce up to 630 horsepower, significantly more than the 510 horsepower of the Model 3 Performance, but like the Tesla model, the new vehicle will feature dual-motor all-wheel-drive systems. Targeting Tesla's rear-wheel-drive and Long Range all-wheel-drive models, lower trims like the i3 40 and i3 50 will likely be better suited for more efficient daily driving.

Speaking of which, out goes the Gen5 tech stack, with BMW's Gen6 battery likely coming in on the sedan, providing higher efficiency and power density. It makes use of cylindrical cells, surpassing the existing Gen5 pouch cells in energy density by 20%, increasing range by 25% while lowering weight and cooling requirements. With a range of 560 miles (900 km) according to the WLTP cycle, the i3 50 will likely outperform the 360-mile (580-km) WLTP range of the Tesla Model 3 Long Range.

In contrast, Tesla employs a combination of NCA/NMC (for Performance and Long Range) and LFP (for base models) battery chemistries. Although Tesla's efficiency in the real world is still remarkable, BMW's Gen6 packs look like they could be the benchmark for premium EVs in 2027.

As for charging up, you'd be able to add up to 217 miles (350 km) of WLTP range in just 10 minutes thanks to support for 300–400-kW DC fast charging. Compare that to the Tesla Model 3, which, under ideal circumstances, can juice up by about 175 miles (280 km) in a 15-minute stop, owing to a maximum capacity of 250 kW on its network of Superchargers. Now that is a big, big difference.

Compatibility with Tesla's Supercharger-Netz is more or less guaranteed by BMW's adoption of the North American Charging Standard (NACS) connector for its Neue Klasse cars, including the i3. This levels the playing field, giving EV users more freedom and access to more than 12,000 Supercharger stations nationwide in addition to other public charging choices.

Now, most importantly, what’s it going to cost? Based on current i3 models, I can see the i3 being priced competitively in the premium sedan segment, likely starting around US$50,000 based on current i3 models. That’s just me speculating though. But if that happens to be the case, it might draw Tesla customers looking for German engineering and a longer range. The appeal of EVs may further increase with regulatory developments that encourage their adoption, such as $7,500 in US tax credits.

But that's not to say BMW is in the clear. There's still a lot of work to be done. The standard set by Tesla's software ecosystem, which includes autonomous driving capabilities and over-the-air updates, is bar none. BMW would need to provide a well-designed user interface and cutting-edge driver-assistance technologies to compete. And of course, the car has to be priced right too.",https://assets.newatlas.com/dims4/default/04478d8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1504x790+0+107/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewatlas-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc4%2F0a%2F9ce59e1a4dcaadf6eff232b1ac2f%2Fbmw-neue-klasse-new-clarity-elec.jpg&na.image_optimisation=0,N,,2025-07-06 19:05:10.818902

ABS has developed advanced simulation modeling of thermal runaway in lithium-ion battery fires, in a critical step forward in tackling one of maritime’s biggest emerging safety risks — car carrier fires involving EVs .

The cutting-edge model, which has now been validated with Texas A&M University research, replicates the thermal runaway profile at the battery cell level, unlocking detailed insight into the total heat released and guiding the appropriate firefighting response.

It is the latest development in ABS’s efforts to address the significant safety challenge presented by transporting electric vehicles at sea.

“Runaway electric vehicle fires can reach temperatures of 1,200°F (650°C) or higher and present unprecedented safety challenges to the shipping industry, which connects manufactured vehicles to global market,” says ABS chairman and CEO Christopher J. Wiernicki. “ABS is at the forefront of the industry’s response to this, which requires a blend of advanced technology, Safety excellence and shipping insight. Developing the ability to accurately predict the behavior of these fires is a perfect example of this and will be a foundation of the ultimate solution.

ABS offers both an enhanced fire protection notation EFP-C(EV) in the ABS Marine Vessel Rules, which provides criteria for additional fire protection arrangements in RO/RO cargo spaces intended to carry electric vehicles as well as the Best Practices for the Transport of Electric Vehicles Advisory which includes additional advice. ABS is also funding advanced research with partners around the world, including at the Laboratory for Ocean Innovation, at Texas A&M University, where battery fire prevention and response is one of eight research priorities.

In a statement published Friday, Clean Energy Canada gave three recommendations to the federal government to help deliver affordable EVs to Canadians for less than $40,000.

The group, based out of Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, said Ottawa should retool its EV mandate by revisiting its near-term targets to help the auto sector “weather this temporary storm” of slumping EV sales.

“Any additional flexibility added in the regulation should be designed to achieve other EV-related goals, such as delivering more affordable EVs and building out Canada’s charging network,” says the statement by executive director Rachel Doran and director of public affairs Joanna Kyriazis.

The plea comes on the heels of auto manufacturing leaders meeting with Prime Minister Mark Carney last week, in which the CEOs repeated their calls for the mandate to be repealed.

Starting next year, the mandate would require 20 per cent of all new light-duty vehicles sold in Canada to be zero-emission vehicles. Those also include plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. The target rises annually to 100 per cent by 2035.

Recent data from Statistics Canada suggests EVs accounted for 7.53 per cent of all new vehicles sold in April.

Following the meeting, the head of an organization representing Ford Canada, GM Canada and Stellantis said he was ""cautiously optimistic"" the government would take action on the mandate.

Clean Energy Canada also called on Ottawa to re-fund the EV incentive program, but to be clearer as to when the program will be phased out.

The government launched the Incentives for Zero-Emission Vehicles program in 2019, which gave car buyers up to $5,000 toward the cost of an electric vehicle. The program was abruptly suspended back in January when its funding ran out.

It has left many dealerships on the hook for the rebate if they hadn't already sent in their claim before the program ended. The federal government put nearly $3 billion into the program during its lifespan.

""The rebate should start at $5,000 and decline by $1,000 each year, providing consumers and automakers with a well-communicated phaseout that avoids periods of artificially lowered EV sales as buyers await the return of rebates or at least clarity,"" Clean Energy Canada says.

A similar policy is in place in Quebec.

Federal ministers have said in recent months that the government was working toward bringing back consumer incentives on EVs.

Those promises faced criticism from automakers themselves because, without implementing a rebate, EV sales are slumping further, as buyers wait for the rebates to come back.

Clean Energy Canada also called on the federal government to reconsider its approach to cheaper EVs from China, which are subject to a 100 per cent tariff which took effect in October. Ottawa is scheduled to review the measure later this year.

""Allowing in a limited quota of these affordable vehicles while also recognizing EU-approved vehicles … would open Canada’s vehicle market to fill important market gaps, drive innovation and ultimately make our auto sector more competitive,"" the group says.

The first is that oil companies may lack the sector-specific experience required in order to succeed with wind and solar projects.
For instance, on a particularly windy day, the wind energy produced will outstrip demand, which drives down prices.
In HVDC systems, resistor technology plays a vital safety role by dissipating excess wind energy during faults, helping to stabilise the grid and prevent damage.
Ultimately, privately owned oil and gas companies are more likely to be driven by shareholder interests than they are by environmental targets.","Oil and gas giant BP recently walked back the net-zero targets it introduced in 2020, saying the company had moved 'too far, too fast’. The announcement is part of a worrying trend of energy providers and other multinationals reducing or watering down their sustainability strategies. Here, Mike Torbitt, managing director of resistor manufacturer Cressall, explores the causes behind this movement and explains the role that resistor technology can play in meeting sustainability targets.

In February 2025, BP announced plans to cut its budget for renewable projects by $5 billion, while simultaneously increasing its investment in fossil fuels to $10 billion per year.

The decision will see the oil giant produce 2.4 million barrels of oil per day by 2030. Given that just 36 fossil fuel companies are responsible for over half of the planet’s emissions, this step backwards has a hugely damaging potential.

But BP is not the only energy provider to backtrack on its sustainability commitments. The move comes a year after fellow oil giant Shell dialled back its 2030 target to cut net carbon intensity from 2016 levels, lowering its goal from 20 per cent to a range of 15 to 20 per cent. But why are energy providers turning their backs on these objectives?

Profit versus planet

Currently, renewable energy projects such as wind and solar are simply not returning as much profit for oil and gas companies as fossil fuels. According to 2023 figures from NPR, US companies producing oil and gas could expect to make a return of between 20 and 50 per cent return on investment on the capital invested into projects. For solar and wind projects, the estimated figure stands at just five to ten per cent.

Consequently, there is less investor interest in the stocks of oil companies that are diverting their budgets towards wind and solar. Take for example the five-year period between the end of 2019 and the end of 2024. New York Times data shows that BP’s stock prices fell by 19 per cent and Shell’s grew by around 15 per cent. Meanwhile, the stock price of competitor Exxon Mobil, which did not invest in wind and solar energy, grew by over 70 per cent.

There are a few major barriers to profitability. The first is that oil companies may lack the sector-specific experience required in order to succeed with wind and solar projects.

Exxon Mobil instead chose to invest in hydrogen and lithium extraction, since the skills needed are very similar to those used in extracting oil. While the mining of these elements comes with its own environmental concerns, both are vital components in the production of battery-powered vehicles.

A second factor affecting profitability is the high initial investment costs for renewable projects combined with the low prices of solar and wind power. This means that it takes years, or even decades, for investors to see return on investment.

Improving infrastructure

While these energy sources have become less expensive to generate in recent years, they tend to produce energy during the same time periods. For instance, on a particularly windy day, the wind energy produced will outstrip demand, which drives down prices. Additionally, wind turbines are increasingly being turned off as the grid is unable to cope with this surplus.

One solution to this issue is using interconnectors, high-voltage direct current (HVDC) cables that connect the energy grids of different countries, enabling the movement of renewable energy to international markets where demand is higher. HVDC technology is ideal for long-distance transmission with minimal energy losses.

In HVDC systems, resistor technology plays a vital safety role by dissipating excess wind energy during faults, helping to stabilise the grid and prevent damage. DC neutral earthing resistors also add a further layer of protection to HVDC converter transformers, both offshore and onshore, by managing fault currents and ensuring system reliability.

Ultimately, privately owned oil and gas companies are more likely to be driven by shareholder interests than they are by environmental targets. However, by ensuring that the correct infrastructure is in place to make the most from the renewable resources, it’s possible to improve both sustainability and profitability.",https://www.altenergymag.com/images/facebooknews.jpg,N,,2025-07-06 19:05:23.789584

Conclusion China's EV dominance is a fact of global commerce, but the U.S. has tools to mitigate risks: refining trade data, boosting domestic production, and diversifying supply chains.","China's grip on the global electric vehicle (EV) supply chain is unassailable, with its firms controlling over 70% of EV battery production and 80% of lithium refining. This dominance—driven by low costs, state subsidies, and strategic control of critical minerals—poses both opportunities and risks for U.S. automakers and investors. As the U.S. accelerates its EV transition, the race to secure supply chains and technological parity is intensifying.

China's Unrivaled Scale and Control

China's EV battery giants, CATL (37.9% global market share) and BYD (17.2%), are not just manufacturers but gatekeepers to the world's fastest-growing industry. In May 2025, China produced 123.5 GWh of power batteries, a 47.9% year-on-year surge, with lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries—preferred for cost efficiency—accounting for 81.6% of installations. CATL's market share in LFP batteries alone hit 36.05%, underscoring its entrenched position.

The U.S., by contrast, produces only 70 GWh of EV batteries annually against a domestic demand of 99 GWh, relying on imports for ~30% of needs—primarily from China. Even U.S. automakers like Tesla and Ford depend on Chinese-made components, as CATL supplies 70% of global EV battery cells. This dependency is compounded by China's near-total control of critical minerals: 100% of spherical graphite processing, 69% of synthetic graphite, and significant stakes in lithium and nickel supply chains.

The U.S. Response: Ambition vs. Realities

The Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) allocated $210 billion to EV production, targeting $100/kWh battery costs by 2030. U.S. battery capacity is projected to nearly double to 421.5 GWh by 2025, with projects like LG Energy Solution and Honda's $4.4 billion Ohio plant (40 GWh capacity) and Toyota's $14 billion North Carolina facility (5,000 jobs).

However, the path is fraught with risks:

1. Policy Uncertainty: A potential Trump administration could roll back IRA tax credits, which currently provide up to $7,500 per EV and $35 billion for battery manufacturing.

2. Cost Disadvantages: U.S. battery production costs remain 20% higher than China's, exacerbated by tariffs on imported components.

3. Supply Chain Gaps: The U.S. lacks domestic refining capacity for lithium and cobalt, relying on Chinese or Australian suppliers.

Investment Opportunities: Where to Play

U.S. Battery Makers: Companies like Tesla (partnering with CATL and Panasonic) and Ford (linked to SK On) benefit from IRA subsidies. However, their stock performance will hinge on reducing supply chain risks.

Critical Minerals: Lithium miners such as Albemarle (ALB) and Livent (LVNT) are positioned to profit from rising demand. Investors should also watch graphite plays like Sayona Mining (SYM.AX), as synthetic graphite demand soars.

Recycling Tech: Companies like Redwood Materials and Li-Cycle could capitalize on China's dominance of battery recycling, which controls 60% of the global market.

Diversification Plays: Firms like Northvolt (Europe's only viable competitor to CATL) and Panasonic (PCRFY), partnering with Tesla, offer exposure to non-Chinese supply chains.

Risks to Avoid

Overexposure to China: Automakers reliant on Chinese batteries or minerals, such as those without U.S.-based gigafactories, face heightened geopolitical and regulatory risks.

Policy Volatility: U.S. firms lacking IRA compliance (e.g., using “Foreign Entity of Concern” suppliers) may lose subsidies.

Cost Inflation: Rising labor and energy costs in the U.S. could erode margins for manufacturers unable to match China's scale.

Strategic Recommendations

Overweight: U.S. battery producers (TSLA, F) and critical mineral stocks (ALB, LVNT) with IRA benefits.

Underweight: Automakers without domestic supply chains (e.g., GM's reliance on South Korea's LG) and speculative lithium miners.

Consider ETFs: The Global X Lithium & Battery Tech ETF (LIT) or ARKQ (autonomous tech) offer diversified exposure.

Conclusion

China's EV dominance is a fact of global commerce, but the U.S. has tools to mitigate risks: refining trade data, boosting domestic production, and diversifying supply chains. Investors must balance exposure to China's scale with bets on U.S. firms capable of competing on cost and innovation. The next three years will determine whether the U.S. can forge an independent supply chain—or remain tethered to a rival's battery factories.",,N,,2025-07-06 17:05:11.537871

Starting next year, the mandate would require 20 per cent of all new light-duty vehicles sold in Canada to be zero-emission vehicles. Those also include plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. The target rises annually to 100 per cent by 2035.

Recent data from Statistics Canada suggests EVs accounted for 7.53 per cent of all new vehicles sold in April.

Following the meeting, the head of an organization representing Ford Canada, GM Canada and Stellantis said he was “cautiously optimistic” the government would take action on the mandate.

Clean Energy Canada also called on Ottawa to re-fund the EV incentive program, but to be clearer as to when the program will be phased out.

The government launched the Incentives for Zero-Emission Vehicles program in 2019, which gave car buyers up to $5,000 toward the cost of an electric vehicle. The program was abruptly suspended back in January when its funding ran out.

It has left many dealerships on the hook for the rebate if they hadn’t already sent in their claim before the program ended. The federal government put nearly $3 billion into the program during its lifespan.

“The rebate should start at $5,000 and decline by $1,000 each year, providing consumers and automakers with a well-communicated phaseout that avoids periods of artificially lowered EV sales as buyers await the return of rebates or at least clarity,” Clean Energy Canada says.

Tesla’s credit revenue highlights the complexities of transitioning to EVs.","Tesla’s dominance in electric vehicle (EV) production is poised to yield significant profits from Canada’s new zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandates, fueling tensions with traditional automakers. According to a recent analysis, Tesla earned $2.8 billion globally in 2024 from selling compliance credits, a figure that accounted for 40% of its profit. As Canada tightens ZEV regulations, Tesla’s credit revenue is expected to grow, raising concerns about market fairness and local economic impacts.

Canada’s ZEV Mandate Drives Credit Demand

Starting in 2026, Canada will require 20% of light-duty vehicle sales to be zero-emission, escalating to 60% by 2030 and 100% by 2035, reports Automotive News. Automakers failing to meet these targets must purchase credits from competitors like Tesla or face fines of $20,000 per non-compliant vehicle.

Tesla, producing only EVs, generates surplus credits, already selling nearly 32,000 in Quebec alone to brands like BMW and Toyota between 2020 and 2024. With national regulations looming, demand for Tesla’s credits is expected to surge, potentially increasing their value.

Economic and Competitive Implications

The credit system creates a financial advantage for Tesla, which reported $2.8 billion in global credit revenue in 2024, equivalent to roughly 3.7 billion CAD at current exchange rates. For traditional automakers, buying credits is often the only viable path to compliance.

“It’s really the only option” for many, said David Adams, CEO of the Global Automakers of Canada reportedly, highlighting the lack of scalable EV production among import brands.

However, this reliance increases costs, which may be passed to consumers, potentially raising vehicle prices.

Critics argue the policy disproportionately benefits Tesla, a company with no Canadian assembly plants. Brian Kingston, CEO of the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers’ Association, called it “nonsensical” to funnel profits to Tesla, which employs fewer Canadians than legacy automakers. Kingston also criticized Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s “directly hostile” stance toward Canada, referencing Musk’s support for U.S. rhetoric about annexing Canada.

Policy Contradictions and Local Backlash

Canada’s ZEV mandate contrasts with other policies targeting Tesla. In March 2025, Transport Minister Chrystia Freeland announced Tesla’s ineligibility for federal EV incentives until U.S. tariffs, deemed “illegitimate and illegal,” are lifted. Provincial rebate programs also excluded Tesla this spring amid backlash against Musk’s comments. These moves aim to curb Tesla’s financial gains, yet the ZEV credit system inadvertently bolsters its revenue, creating a policy paradox.

Industry and Regulatory Outlook

The ZEV mandate reflects Canada’s push for cleaner transportation, aligning with global trends toward electrification. However, the credit system’s structure raises questions about fairness and long-term impacts on Canada’s auto industry, which employs thousands in manufacturing.

Kingston warned that enriching Tesla undermines local workers and contradicts Ottawa’s resistance to aggressive U.S. trade policies. As automakers invest in EV production—Ford plans a new EV plant in Ontario by 2027—the reliance on credits may wane, but Tesla’s head start ensures it remains a key player.

Tesla’s credit revenue highlights the complexities of transitioning to EVs. While the policy accelerates decarbonization, it sparks debate over economic equity and national priorities. As Canada balances environmental goals with industry concerns, the ZEV mandate’s ripple effects will shape the EV market for years to come.

Locally and nationally, there’s been a lot of talk about energy affordability lately. But what actually goes into our energy bills, and how much control do we have over what we’re paying? Take a few minutes to study your bill and you’ll realize the answer is more complicated than the kilowatt hours of electricity or therms of natural gas you use.

A closer look at your energy bill

The primary factor influencing your energy bill is, unsurprisingly, energy consumption. You also help to pay for infrastructure upgrades, like new wind farms, transmission lines or pipelines. And, if you’re an Xcel Energy customer like me, you’ll see line items that fund energy efficiency and electrification programs approved by the Colorado Public Utilities Commission . For those curious, these charges are defined on the last page of your bill and on Xcel’s website .

Keep in mind that Xcel Energy is a regulated utility in Colorado. That means the rates and charges we pay have to be approved by the Colorado Public Utilities Commission before any changes can be made to customers’ bills.

Beyond the bill – commodity pricing and federal policy

Another factor influencing your bills is the wholesale cost of fuel and purchased energy . In Xcel’s case, these costs are adjusted quarterly and directly passed onto customers. Even though Xcel does not profit from these charges, they can have a significant impact on our bills. How? Because fuels like natural gas – used for both electricity generation and heating buildings – are subject to variables like weather and market conditions . Remember winter storm Uri ? The February 2021 event had a huge impact on gas prices across the central U.S. and Colorado. Demand for gas spiked, supply dropped and prices increased as a result. In Colorado, the public utilities commission allowed electric and gas utilities to recover these extraordinary costs by adding an additional fee to customer bills for a limited amount of time.

Federal policy can also impact energy costs. Consider some of the changes to tax law just passed by Congress. Tax credits for solar and wind energy projects are being phased out years sooner than anticipated . At the same time, electricity demand is surging across the country . Building any type of new power plant takes time, but solar, wind, and batteries are the fastest to deploy . Burning natural gas for electricity is generally cleaner and more efficient than coal, but manufacturers of natural gas turbines are facing supply-chain backlogs of up to five years . The likely impact of all of this is higher energy bills — if renewable electricity projects cost more to build, then the cost of electricity will be more expensive . And it doesn’t really matter how much natural gas you drill or frack if a lack of turbines means new natural gas power plants are slow to come online — a limited supply of electricity in the face of increasing demand will simply increase costs.

Invest in the negawatt

With so much outside influence on our energy bills, how can we take control? By investing in the cleanest, least expensive form of energy: the negawatt, or the energy we don’t use . Energy efficiency is one of the best ways to hedge against future energy cost increases, because when you use less, you pay less. You’re also likely to make your home more comfortable at the same time.

How to get started? Get a home energy audit . These diagnostic assessments are the best way to figure out where your home is inefficient, so you can follow through on the recommendations and make strategic improvements. Even with federal tax credits for home efficiency projects sunsetting at the end of this year , the High Country Conservation Center offers incentives for energy efficiency and electrification projects. And for a limited time, High Country Conservation Center will cover 100% of eligible project costs up to $5,000 for full-time residents who earn up to 150% of the Area Median Income . Xcel Energy offers a number of rebates , too.

It’s easy to feel powerless in the face of policy and regulatory changes, whether state or federal. But without sacrificing comfort or breaking the bank, you do have the power to use less power.",https://swiftmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/mountain.swiftcom.com/images/sites/2/2019/05/23112649/AskEartha-SDN-112015.jpg,N,,2025-07-06 17:05:22.342929

The 2024 weather events included storms, wildfires, droughts, flooding, tornadoes, tropical cyclones and other types of extreme weather.
In addition to considering which areas are “high risk”, insurers also assess the building materials used for construction.
In California, which has strict building codes to mitigate wildfire risk, insurers have been increasingly rejecting requests for coverage.","As countries worldwide experience more regular extreme weather events, insurers have become more reluctant to cover properties in high-risk areas. However, without insurance, it is impossible for many people to gain access to mortgage financing. We are seeing an insurance crisis in the United States, as insurers are becoming less likely to offer coverage for homes in certain areas, particularly those that have experienced natural disasters, such as flooding and wildfire, in recent years.

Between 2018 and December 2024, over 1.9 million home insurance contracts were “nonrenewed”, meaning they came to an end. The nonrenewal rate tripled or more in over 200 U.S. counties, according to a congressional report. These figures became clear following an investigation spurred by the Senate Budget Committee, which demanded in November 2023 that the largest U.S. insurance companies provide the number of nonrenewals by county and year.

Some states and cities are seeing greater nonrenewal rates than others, particularly those at greater risk of fire, flood, hurricanes and other severe weather events. Although there is still a lack of information on the reason behind the nonrenewals, the countrywide map of nonrenewals strongly reflects the climate crisis as it is being seen across the U.S. Some of the areas most affected include California, Florida, and North Carolina.

Following the publication of the report, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse said, “The climate crisis that is coming our way is not just about polar bears, and it’s not just about green jobs.” Whitehouse added, “It actually is coming through your mail slot, in the form of insurance cancellations, insurance nonrenewals and dramatic increases in insurance costs.”

According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, in 2024, there were 27 individual weather and climate disasters, coming only behind the record-setting 28 events in 2023. Last year was the fourth-costliest year on record in terms of these types of events, with a total cost of approximately $182.7 billion, coming after 2017 ($395.9 billion), 2005 ($268.5 billion), and 2022 ($183.6 billion). The 2024 weather events included storms, wildfires, droughts, flooding, tornadoes, tropical cyclones and other types of extreme weather.

In addition to considering which areas are “high risk”, insurers also assess the building materials used for construction. Many mobile or manufactured homes are not covered by insurers. Companies may also impose restrictions on houses constructed out of wood and other fire-prone materials. However, even states with strict building codes are seeing more coverage denials. In California, which has strict building codes to mitigate wildfire risk, insurers have been increasingly rejecting requests for coverage. In certain counties, nonrenewal rates have risen by over 500 percent since 2018.

The government has started to respond to the problem in some areas of the country. For example, in December, officials announced that they would make it easier for insurers to increase rates, but in exchange, they must agree to continue insuring consumers in fire-prone areas. Other state and local governments are carrying out prescribed burns in residential areas, as well as clearing vegetation close to houses, to reduce the risk of wildfire spread in these areas.

Some companies have halted new insurance policies in certain parts of the country, such as AllState. In 2022, AllState paused the sale of new home and condo insurance policies in California. A spokesperson for the firm stated, “Our payments to help California residents recover from accidents and disasters have increased significantly in recent years due to higher repair costs and more frequent and severe weather… We continue to offer coverage to most existing home insurance customers.”

State Farm, one of the biggest insurance providers in the U.S., followed suit in 2023 by halting the sale of new housing insurance products in California. In Florida, by the spring of 2024, at least 12 insurance companieshad stopped selling housing insurance in the state. Farmers Insurance stated upon withdrawing from Florida, “This business decision was necessary to effectively manage risk exposure.”

A 2024 report by the non-profit First Street Foundation, showed that 23.9 million properties in the U.S. were at risk from damaging winds, 4.4 million properties were at risk from wildfire, and a further 12 million properties were at significant risk of flooding – in addition to properties in the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema)'s Special Flood Hazard Areas. The report stated, “Private insurance companies are effectively labelling areas as uninsurable.”

The result of the withdrawal of insurance companies from certain parts of the country is the inability for consumers to get a mortgage, meaning fewer people can buy a house. As houses sit empty, it drives down property prices in the area and leads to less tax revenue being collected to invest in services. Many communities are facing these consequences and feel left behind. If the U.S. government does not take action to mitigate the risk of the impact of extreme weather events in these areas or encourage insurers to continue covering high-risk areas, this will happen to a greater number of communities across the country.

Town officials requested that FERC mandate the installation of pollution control technologies at the compressor stations, should the proposal be approved.","Transco, a major interstate natural gas pipeline system in the United States owned by Williams, a Houston-based energy infrastructure company, is planning to expand its operations in five states. State records show that the project would have a devastating impact on air pollution in several North Carolina communities.

What's happening?

Inside Climate News reported that the expansion would increase horsepower at two compressor stations located along the pipeline in the towns of Mooresville and Lexington. The increased throughput would allow more gas to flow through the pipeline, at an environmental cost of releasing more than 935,000 tons of planet-warming pollution annually.

Meanwhile, communities near the pipeline, including those with compressor stations, would be exposed to pollution from hazardous substances such as carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, sulfur dioxide, and volatile organic compounds at concentrations up to 350% higher than current levels.

The 42-inch pipeline isn't just a threat to air quality; it's also a potential danger to life and property in the event of an explosion.

Maps released by Transco that show the proposed route for the pipeline reveal that hundreds of homes, businesses, schools, daycare centers, and recreational areas are located within the pipeline's blast zone — the area around a natural gas pipeline where an explosion could cause serious injury or death due to flying debris, a pressure wave, or incineration.

""This is a serious environmental and public health danger that FERC should consider,"" Erin Sutherland, the policy and program director of the Pipeline Safety Trust, a nonprofit environmental watchdog, said in a comment to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

Why is the proposed pipeline expansion concerning?

Juhi Modi, North Carolina field coordinator at Appalachian Voices, a grassroots environmental organization, said that residents in Mooresville and Lexington ""are already burdened by decades of air pollution from existing Transco infrastructure and deserve to breathe clean air.""

Data from the Environmental Protection Agency's EJ Screen appears to support these findings, as it indicates that communities located within a one-mile radius of the compressor station in Lexington experience higher-than-average exposure to fine particulate matter, or PM2.5. While the pipeline infrastructure isn't the only contributor to poor air quality, it likely plays a major role.

Compressor stations also release benzene, a known human carcinogen, and both towns already have exceedingly high levels of the chemical. ""In Lexington, benzene exceeds federal hourly emission rates by 100 times; in Mooresville, the figure is 61 times,"" per Inside Climate News.

Consistently poor air quality is linked to a number of health problems, including asthma, lung cancer, and cardiovascular diseases, and living near a gas pipeline can worsen these ailments or increase the chance of developing them.

The fact that hundreds of people live near the proposed pipeline expansion, as well as businesses, churches, and schools operating in the area, is also quite concerning. While pipeline explosions are not extremely frequent, the consequences can be severe when they do happen, according to the Houston-based law firm Kherkher Garcia.

And even though explosions are rare, natural gas pipelines have been shown to leak methane — a potent planet-warming gas — at much higher levels than previously thought, even to the point of being detectable from space using satellite technology.

What's being done to protect North Carolina residents?

The Midway Town Council voted to oppose the pipeline project and compressor station in Lexington, which is ten miles away from Midway. Town officials requested that FERC mandate the installation of pollution control technologies at the compressor stations, should the proposal be approved.

Recently, U.S. appeals courts have blocked construction on several gas pipeline projects in New Jersey and Tennessee, indicating that awareness is growing about the environmental and societal harms associated with burning dirty fuels.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Transco-pipelineimage-recyoTX8WuPFH5hC9-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-06 16:06:16.783049

The group, based out of Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, said Ottawa should retool its EV mandate by revisiting its near-term targets to help the auto sector “weather this temporary storm” of slumping EV sales.

“Any additional flexibility added in the regulation should be designed to achieve other EV-related goals, such as delivering more affordable EVs and building out Canada’s charging network,” says the statement by executive director Rachel Doran and director of public affairs Joanna Kyriazis.

The plea comes on the heels of auto manufacturing leaders meeting with Prime Minister Mark Carney last week, in which the CEOs repeated their calls for the mandate to be repealed.

Starting next year, the mandate would require 20 per cent of all new light-duty vehicles sold in Canada to be zero-emission vehicles. Those also include plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. The target rises annually to 100 per cent by 2035.

Recent data from Statistics Canada suggests EVs accounted for 7.53 per cent of all new vehicles sold in April.

Following the meeting, the head of an organization representing Ford Canada, GM Canada and Stellantis said he was ""cautiously optimistic"" the government would take action on the mandate.

Clean Energy Canada also called on Ottawa to re-fund the EV incentive program, but to be clearer as to when the program will be phased out.

The government launched the Incentives for Zero-Emission Vehicles program in 2019, which gave car buyers up to $5,000 toward the cost of an electric vehicle. The program was abruptly suspended back in January when its funding ran out.

It has left many dealerships on the hook for the rebate if they hadn't already sent in their claim before the program ended. The federal government put nearly $3 billion into the program during its lifespan.

""The rebate should start at $5,000 and decline by $1,000 each year, providing consumers and automakers with a well-communicated phaseout that avoids periods of artificially lowered EV sales as buyers await the return of rebates or at least clarity,"" Clean Energy Canada says.

A similar policy is in place in Quebec.

Federal ministers have said in recent months that the government was working toward bringing back consumer incentives on EVs.

Those promises faced criticism from automakers themselves because, without implementing a rebate, EV sales are slumping further, as buyers wait for the rebates to come back.

Clean Energy Canada also called on the federal government to reconsider its approach to cheaper EVs from China, which are subject to a 100 per cent tariff which took effect in October. Ottawa is scheduled to review the measure later this year.

""Allowing in a limited quota of these affordable vehicles while also recognizing EU-approved vehicles … would open Canada’s vehicle market to fill important market gaps, drive innovation and ultimately make our auto sector more competitive,"" the group says.

Consider used EVs: As more models hit the market, prices on pre-owned electric cars are dropping.","Why this matters for you

For U.S. consumers, this isn’t just about bragging rights in the global auto race. It’s about what you’ll pay for your next vehicle.

If Chinese EVs enter Western markets without tariffs, they could undercut competitors by tens of thousands of dollars — bringing huge savings to consumers but serious threats to U.S. auto industry jobs. In response, the U.S. government has already imposed steep tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, which may shield domestic automakers for now but also delay price competition.

Farley’s warning comes as more and more Americans are looking to switch to EVs amid soaring gas prices and expanding charging infrastructure. But since Tesla, Ford and GM EVs often start in the $40,000-$60,000 range, many Americans are priced out.

Can the U.S. catch up?

China’s advantage? It controls much of the world’s battery production and can bring new EVs to market in a fraction of the time compared to U.S. automakers.

Ford is working on a next-gen affordable EV platform intended to match China's costs but says it won't arrive until 2027. Tesla is also aiming to launch a $25,000 “Model 2,” but timelines remain uncertain. Until then, the price gap persists.

One other fact is that Apple and Google just ""decided not to go into the car business,"" according to Farley. This has created significant barriers to the U.S. competing with the level of technological integration made available in Chinese vehicles.

""They have far superior in-vehicle technology. Huawei and Xiaomi are in every car,"" Farley added. ""You get in, you don't have to pair your phone. Automatically, your whole digital life is mirrored in the car.""

What you can expect next

For now, U.S. car buyers won’t see sub-$20,000 EVs on the lot — but pressure is mounting. Here’s how to stay ahead:

Watch for incentives: Federal EV tax credits can ease the price of U.S.-made electric cars.

Consider used EVs: As more models hit the market, prices on pre-owned electric cars are dropping. Just make sure you double-check the battery warranty before buying used.

Plan long-term: If you’re planning to switch to electric in the next few years, competition and innovation may bring prices down — eventually.

Ford and Farley are painfully aware that market dynamics are shifting. And for American drivers, the race to affordable EVs is on.",https://media1.moneywise.com/a/111026/most-humbling-thing-ive-ever-seen-ford-ceo-sounds-alarm-on-chinas-ev-dominance-and-what-that-could-mean-for-american-automakers-and-your-car-costs_facebook_thumb_1200x628_v20250706151631.jpg,N,,2025-07-06 16:05:21.801351

That’s why we urge Congress to protect — not repeal — these clean energy tax credits because they’re saving Arizonans money while delivering real benefits to our state and communities.","Scripture teaches us that we have a responsibility to care for all of God’s creation.

As faith leaders in Arizona, we have a duty to lead our congregations, but also to serve the broader community as well as future generations. For us, that means leaving the land, water and air we share better than we found it.

Arizona is already experiencing record-setting heat waves virtually every summer as well as ongoing drought, and the risk of weather disasters like wildfires and floods are more and more common. Just like other Arizona homeowners, we see higher and higher power bills because of these sustained weeks and months with temperatures over 100°F. But because of our responsibility as leaders of our congregations and in the communities we serve, we wanted to be proactive: transition to more clean energy usage, reduce our carbon footprint and reduce our utility costs.

As congregations, we rely on tithes from our members to pay for much of our operations, so we don’t keep large margins or cash reserves. Almost every dollar we receive goes back to the community, so we’re always looking for responsible ways to lower our costs. But we were worried about the possibility of high up-front costs preventing us from being able to make a decision that we knew would save more money over the long-term.

Fortunately, a few years ago Congress enacted clean energy tax credits that allow businesses, homeowners, nonprofits and houses of worship to transition to solar. Those tax credits reduced the cost of installation by 30% — a huge savings that will also result in lower utility costs over the long-term. And because we are tax exempt, we were able to apply for Direct Pay to enjoy those same savings.

For all of our congregations, the 30% incentive was an important factor in the decision to make the investment in solar.

However, these important tax credits that thousands of Arizona households and nonprofits have been able to use to transition to solar, are in jeopardy. Congress is considering legislation that would repeal these incentives by the end of the year and raise the costs of investing in clean energy. In fact, we know of faith leaders who are hoping to take advantage of Direct Pay in the next year or two. Getting rid of these investments would also put many Arizonans who work in the clean energy industry out of work. That’s why we urge Congress to protect — not repeal — these clean energy tax credits because they’re saving Arizonans money while delivering real benefits to our state and communities.

The plunge comes despite EV makers spending record amounts on customer discounts and incentives.
“It’s [driving] range, it’s cost and it’s charging infrastructure,” said Mark Barrott, automotive lead at consulting firm Plante Moran.","Not even bargain-basement deals are enough to entice U.S. drivers to go all-in on electric vehicles.

A Hyundai dealership in New Jersey is hyping a $169-a-month lease on its Ioniq 6 sedan, which carries a sticker price of about $38,000, making it far less expensive than a comparably priced lease on its gasoline-burning models.

Kia will lease its small Niro EV SUV for as little as $129 a month.

And a GMC dealership in Indiana touts the Hummer EV—with a $100,000 sticker price—for a monthly lease payment of $650, similar to the monthly payment for a gas-powered car that costs half as much to buy.

Even as automakers pile on the financial incentives to entice buyers, EV sales are falling. In June they were lower by 6.2%, the third straight monthly decline for battery-powered cars, according to estimates from Motor Intelligence, an industry-research firm. Tesla, which accounts for roughly half the EV market in the U.S., said last week that its global sales dropped 13.5% during the second quarter.

The plunge comes despite EV makers spending record amounts on customer discounts and incentives. Meanwhile, Republican lawmakers are phasing out the $7,500 EV tax credit that has been in place for years to help boost sales.

Why are so many American drivers hesitant? “It’s [driving] range, it’s cost and it’s charging infrastructure,” said Mark Barrott, automotive lead at consulting firm Plante Moran. “They’ve always been the big three reasons.”

The EV tax credits targeted by Republicans have been a key driver of electric-car sales, particularly among less-affluent buyers.

While Chantal may not pack the devastating punch of previous storms like Hurricane Helene, Duke Energy officials are warning residents that this storm carries its own unique set of dangers that could leave thousands without power for days. The combination of saturated ground conditions and unpredictable wind patterns has emergency crews on high alert across the region.

The utility giant is mobilizing crews across multiple states, positioning equipment and personnel in strategic locations to respond to what could become a complex and challenging restoration effort.

The storm’s approach comes at a particularly vulnerable time for the state’s power infrastructure. Recent weather patterns have already weakened tree root systems, making them more susceptible to toppling during high winds. This creates a domino effect that can take down power lines and leave entire neighborhoods in darkness.

The hidden dangers lurking in Chantal’s path

What makes Tropical Storm Chantal particularly concerning for energy crews isn’t just its wind speed, but the combination of factors that create perfect conditions for electrical disasters. The storm’s slow-moving nature means prolonged exposure to damaging winds and torrential storms that can saturate the ground beneath power poles and transmission towers.

Duke Energy‘s preparation strategy reflects lessons learned from previous storms that caught the company off guard. The utility has positioned crews not just along the coast where the storm is expected to make its most direct impact, but also throughout central North Carolina where seemingly minor weather events can cascade into major outages.

The company’s proactive approach includes pre-positioning bucket trucks, generators, and specialized equipment in areas that historically experience the most significant storm-related damage. This strategic deployment could mean the difference between hours and days of power restoration for affected customers.

Emergency response teams are particularly focused on protecting critical infrastructure that serves hospitals, emergency services, and essential businesses. These facilities receive priority attention during storm events, but the interconnected nature of the power grid means that damage in one area can ripple across entire regions.

Residents face tough choices as storm approaches

For families throughout North Carolina, Tropical Storm Chantal represents more than just another weather event. The storm’s timing during summer months means that extended power outages could create dangerous conditions for vulnerable populations, including elderly residents and those with medical conditions requiring electrical equipment.

Duke Energy is urging customers to take proactive steps now, before the storm arrives. This includes assembling emergency kits with flashlights, batteries, non-perishable food, and enough water for at least three days. The company also recommends unplugging non-essential electronics to prevent damage from power surges when electricity is restored.

The psychological impact of storm preparation cannot be understated. Many North Carolina residents are still recovering from previous hurricane seasons that left lasting trauma and financial hardship. The prospect of another major weather event, even one classified as a tropical storm, can trigger anxiety and stress that extends far beyond the immediate physical dangers.

Local emergency management officials are working closely with Duke Energy to coordinate response efforts and ensure that resources are deployed efficiently. This collaboration includes establishing emergency shelters, coordinating with local law enforcement, and maintaining communication systems that can operate independently of the main power grid.

Technology and tradition collide in storm response

Modern storm preparation involves sophisticated weather modeling, advanced communication systems, and real-time monitoring of electrical infrastructure. Duke Energy’s control centers can track outages as they occur and dispatch crews to the most critical locations first, maximizing the efficiency of restoration efforts.

However, the reality of storm response still depends heavily on traditional manual labor and human expertise. Skilled line workers must physically inspect damaged equipment, climb poles in dangerous conditions, and work long hours in challenging weather to restore power to affected communities.

The company’s investment in smart grid technology has improved its ability to isolate damaged sections of the electrical system, preventing minor problems from becoming major outages. This technology allows operators to remotely control switches and reroute power around damaged areas, reducing the overall impact on customers.

Despite these technological advances, the fundamental challenge remains the same: getting qualified workers to damaged equipment as quickly and safely as possible. This human element means that storm response is still limited by factors like road conditions, worker safety, and the availability of specialized equipment.

Economic implications extend beyond immediate costs

The economic impact of Tropical Storm Chantal extends far beyond the immediate costs of storm preparation and response. Extended power outages can devastate local businesses, spoil food supplies, and disrupt essential services that communities depend on for daily life.

Small businesses are particularly vulnerable to storm-related outages because they often lack the resources to invest in backup power systems or weather-resistant infrastructure. A restaurant that loses power for several days may be forced to discard thousands of dollars worth of perishable inventory, while retail stores may lose sales to competitors in unaffected areas.

The tourism industry, which is crucial to North Carolina’s coastal economy, faces particular challenges from storm events. Hotels, restaurants, and entertainment venues that depend on summer visitors can see their busiest season disrupted by weather events that keep tourists away even after the immediate danger has passed.

Duke Energy’s preparation efforts include working with major commercial and industrial customers to ensure that critical facilities can maintain operations during and after the storm. This includes hospitals, manufacturing plants, and data centers that serve customers across multiple states.

Safety concerns top priority for utility workers

The men and women who will restore power after Tropical Storm Chantal face dangers that most people never consider. Working with high-voltage electrical equipment in wet, windy conditions requires specialized training and constant vigilance to prevent accidents that could prove fatal.

Duke Energy has implemented comprehensive safety protocols that sometimes slow down restoration efforts but are essential for protecting workers. These include mandatory safety briefings, specialized equipment inspections, and communication procedures that ensure crews can call for help if they encounter dangerous conditions.

The company’s emphasis on worker safety extends to interactions with the public during storm response. Motorists who encounter utility crews working along roadways are urged to slow down and move over, giving workers the space they need to perform their duties safely.

Emergency responders also face increased risks during storm events as they respond to calls for help while navigating dangerous road conditions and potential electrical hazards. The coordination between utility companies and emergency services is crucial for ensuring that both workers and the public remain safe during restoration efforts.

Long-term resilience requires ongoing investment

Tropical Storm Chantal serves as a reminder that North Carolina’s electrical infrastructure requires ongoing investment and maintenance to withstand increasingly frequent and severe weather events. Climate change has altered traditional storm patterns, creating new challenges for utility companies that must adapt their systems accordingly.

Duke Energy’s long-term strategy includes hardening electrical infrastructure through underground power lines in vulnerable areas, improved vegetation management, and upgraded equipment that can better withstand extreme weather conditions. These investments require significant capital expenditures that are ultimately reflected in customer rates.

The company is also exploring new technologies that could revolutionize storm response, including drone inspections of damaged equipment, advanced weather forecasting systems, and automated switching systems that can restore power without human intervention in certain circumstances.

As North Carolina residents prepare for Tropical Storm Chantal’s arrival, the focus remains on immediate safety and emergency preparedness. However, the storm also highlights the ongoing need for resilient infrastructure that can support communities through whatever challenges future weather events may bring.

The next few days will test both the preparedness of utility companies and the resilience of communities across North Carolina. While no one can predict exactly how Tropical Storm Chantal will impact the state, the extensive preparation efforts underway demonstrate the serious commitment to keeping residents safe and restoring normal life as quickly as possible after the storm passes.",https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/shutterstock_2511389829-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-07-06 15:05:53.501574

Plug Power, a U.S. company that builds clean hydrogen plants, just got huge support. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) gave it a conditional loan guarantee of up to $1.66 billion. This will help Plug Power build six large hydrogen factories across the U.S.

Boosts green hydrogen production in America

Plug will supply hydrogen to Amazon, Walmart, and Home Depot

Could make clean hydrogen common and affordable

What Is Green Hydrogen?

Green hydrogen is made by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using electricity from renewable energy like wind or solar. This process is clean and does not use fossil fuels.

Step What Happens Why It’s Good 1 Water is split into hydrogen and oxygen using electricity No pollution 2 Electricity comes from solar or wind power 100% clean energy 3 Hydrogen is stored and used in vehicles or factories Good for the planet

Where Are the New Projects?

Plug Power will build six green hydrogen plants in the U.S.

Graham, Texas – “Project Limestone” (45 tons/day using wind power)

Woodbine, Georgia – Already running (25 tons/day plant)

Others planned in California, Louisiana, Tennessee, and New York

All plants will use PEM (proton exchange membrane) electrolyzers, which are very efficient and powered by renewable energy.

How the Loan Works

This is a loan guarantee, not free money. The DOE helps Plug Power get loans at a lower interest rate by backing the loan in case of failure. Plug still has to pay it back.

Big Business Plans

Goal: 500 tons/day of hydrogen by 2025

Each plant may cost $250 million

Each may produce up to 15 tons/day

Tax Credit Support

Plug Power plans to use the 45V hydrogen tax credit, which gives up to $3 per kg of clean hydrogen produced. But some lawmakers may try to end it early, which could hurt Plug’s future funding.

What This Means for Investors

After the announcement, Plug Power’s stock price jumped. Other hydrogen companies also saw a boost.

But Plug lost $1.4 billion in 2023

It lost another $296 million in early 2024

The company has never made a profit

So while this is a big win, investors must be careful. The company is still in a risky position.

Why This Is Good for the Planet

Nearly 60 percent said it was “unacceptable” for the bill to increase the national debt beyond its current $36 trillion level.","President Donald Trump on Friday signed into law a massive and controversial tax and spending package during a theatrical Independence Day celebration on the White House South Lawn—an event rich in pageantry and politics, but shadowed by the economic and social upheaval the legislation is expected to unleash across the country.

With red, white, and blue bunting draped across the White House, and fighter jets roaring overhead in a choreographed flyover, Trump used the moment to portray himself as a president who delivers—on the battlefield, in the courtroom, and now in Congress.

“Promises made, promises kept—and we’ve kept them,” he declared, moments before using a ceremonial gavel gifted by House Speaker Mike Johnson to seal the bill’s passage.

The signing capped weeks of bruising intraparty wrangling and a months-long legislative slog, as Republicans rushed to pass the multitrillion-dollar package before Trump’s self-imposed July 4 deadline. The final law extends Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, eliminates taxes on tips and Social Security income, and makes sweeping cuts to Medicaid and food stamp programs—long-standing Republican targets that now stand gutted.

A Fight on the Right: Trump vs. His Base

But beyond its staggering fiscal scope and deeply polarizing content, the bill’s passage is also notable for the political firestorm it ignited within the president’s own party. In achieving what may be his most consequential legislative victory to date, Trump bulldozed opposition not just from Democrats, but from prominent voices on the right, including allies like Elon Musk and high-profile conservative lawmakers who openly questioned the bill’s long-term consequences.

For months, Trump lobbied aggressively to unify Republicans around the bill, knowing it would face total resistance from Democrats. But the real battle played out within the GOP itself.

Tech billionaire Elon Musk—long seen as an unofficial Trump adviser and one of his most influential outside supporters—publicly opposed the legislation’s size and scope, especially provisions cutting funding for tech-friendly energy programs and expanding federal surveillance under the guise of immigration enforcement. Musk reportedly urged congressional allies to vote against the bill, arguing it betrayed “economic freedom” and marked a return to “bloated federal overreach.”

His resistance was part of a broader split on the American right, where fiscal conservatives and libertarian-leaning Republicans balked at the bill’s $3.3 trillion projected impact on the national debt. In the House, two Republicans broke ranks—most notably Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, a libertarian conservative who has frequently clashed with Trump despite aligning with him ideologically. Massie condemned the package as “fiscally insane” and a “betrayal of the limited government principles the party once claimed to stand for.”

In the Senate, North Carolina Republican Thom Tillis went a step further, publicly opposing the bill and announcing he would not seek reelection. Tillis had long warned that slashing healthcare access for millions while handing tax breaks to billionaires would backfire politically. His stance earned him the ire of Trump’s political apparatus, which swiftly began supporting potential challengers for his Senate seat.

The legislation narrowly passed the Senate thanks to Vice President J.D. Vance, who broke a 50-50 tie by casting the deciding vote. Though once a Trump skeptic, Vance has emerged as a reliable enforcer of the president’s agenda.

A Full-Scale Dismantling of the Democratic Legacy

The bill marks a sweeping rejection of the policy architecture laid by former presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden. It repeals large parts of the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion, claws back climate-related tax credits enacted under Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, and guts key provisions aimed at helping low-income families.

According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the package will push nearly 12 million Americans off health coverage and reduce food assistance eligibility for millions more. At the same time, it devotes tens of billions to building new migrant detention centers, expands federal immigration enforcement, and beefs up surveillance programs across the southern border.

Trump defended the cuts as necessary tradeoffs to spur what he described as an “economic rocket ship.” Speaking to Fourth of July attendees before signing the bill, he said, “We’re going to make this country the strongest, the richest, and the freest it’s ever been. That starts with getting Washington out of your pocket and your doctor’s office.”

Democrats were quick to respond. Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin condemned the law as “devastating,” accusing Trump and Republicans of “handing billionaires a $5 trillion gift while robbing working families of basic dignity.”

AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler echoed the criticism, calling the bill “the worst job-killing legislation in modern history” and warning it would leave tens of millions “more vulnerable, more desperate, and more disposable.”

A Campaign Blueprint—and a Midterm Battleground

As the fireworks display began and Trump and First Lady Melania danced on the Truman Balcony to “Y.M.C.A.”—a now-familiar campaign anthem—the president’s political machine was already shifting into campaign mode. The White House framed the bill not just as a policy achievement, but as the cornerstone of Trump’s 2026 midterm strategy.

Party officials confirmed that Republican leadership is planning a “victory tour” to showcase the bill’s key promises in swing states, while Democrats are preparing to use it as a rallying cry for what they say is a betrayal of the American working class.

Plans for nationwide rallies, protest vigils, voter registration drives, and targeted ad campaigns are already underway. The DNC has reportedly commissioned a series of attack ads focused on Republicans in vulnerable districts, tying them directly to the Medicaid and food stamp cuts, and the bill’s $3.3 trillion projected addition to the national debt.

Polls show a country divided. A Washington Post/Ipsos survey found that while most Americans support eliminating taxes on tips and boosting child tax credits, majorities oppose slashing food assistance and expanding immigration detention spending. Nearly 60 percent said it was “unacceptable” for the bill to increase the national debt beyond its current $36 trillion level.

For Trump, however, the legislative win is personal. After a flurry of Supreme Court victories and a show of military strength following the bombing of Iranian nuclear facilities last month, the budget bill adds to a string of momentum that could shape the tone of the 2026 elections.

But even some within his party warn that the bill’s real consequences may only be felt months from now—when families begin losing Medicaid, food insecurity spikes, and the debt begins to climb faster than projected.",https://tkcdn.tekedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/06081219/Trump-bill.jpg,N,,2025-07-06 19:05:33.534540

In important ways, the water crisis had its roots in the kind of cost-cutting policy approaches that Trump favors.
And roughly 29 percent of Flint adultsthat we surveyed showed heightened signs of posttraumatic stress disorder in relationship to the water crisis.","My hometown of Flint is perhaps exactly the kind of city President Donald Trump had in mind when he famously railed against “American carnage” in his 2017 inauguration speech and made clear that his approach to domestic policy and geopolitics would be unlike any president before him. After all, Trump was speaking to the damage done to once-proud manufacturing hubs due to forces like globalization — a frequent target of Trump and today’s political right. Flint appears to be the kind of city that Trump believes his agenda, particularly the sweeping tariffs he is imposing, will revitalize.

But regardless of how his often-haphazard trade policy unfolds, the Trump administration is making other moves that are already having the opposite effect in Flint: 11 years after the city’s water famously became toxic, the administration is lifting water and environmental quality controls, canceling research to monitor residents’ health and upending early education programs. The net result is that Trumponomics will actually impede the critical revitalization efforts that are needed in the Rust Belt.

In addition to tariffs, Trump’s economic proposals focus on steep de-regulation and tax incentives for corporations. They’re designed to promote economic growth with little attention to the culture and health of people in the communities they affect. This means that the administration’s policies inevitably come at the expense of critical environmental protections and public health measures that are already greatly imperiled in the many low-income communities like Flint that dot the Midwest.

As a public health researcher as well as someone born and raised in the city, I can already see this happening. But generally speaking, there should always be concern when the value and strength of a community is perceived solely in terms of its economic output, rather than the quality of life of its people.

Just five months into Trump 2.0, Flint is already an emblem of what’s going wrong with the new administration’s plans for post-industrial cities like mine. Policies designed to stimulate economic growth will fail to revitalize cities like Flint unless they are accompanied by efforts to repair the social and environmental damage that previous failed policies left behind.

It’s also an object lesson in how reflexive austerity is nearly always bad for public health.

Flint was the birthplace of General Motors and an essential part of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s “Arsenal of Democracy” against the Axis powers in World War II. A generation ago, it sat atop the automobile industry as a predominantly white city with a booming middle class. However, over time, consumers began to seek out vehicles from foreign competitors like Honda and Toyota that were not only more reliable and more fuel efficient, but also cheaper. Simultaneously, NAFTA, and the precursors to it, paved the way for American automakers to more rapidly move production to other countries to take advantage of lower labor costs.

The result in Flint and cities like it was a rapid process of deindustrialization, and many of the socioeconomic ills that come with that — white flight, unemployment, crime, distressed natural environments and diminished public health.

In 2014, what became known as the Flint Water Crisis marked the nadir of that decline and brought the impact of the collapse of the country’s manufacturing industry, and potential consequences, into clear focus.

In fact, being known as the city with the nation’s worst tap water was a potentially modest upgrade from Flint’s prior reputation as one of America’s murder capitals. In the last few years, however, Flint has largely avoided the national headlines, at least since a $626 million in civic settlement funds were approved in 2021 to make amends for the massive manmade environmental disaster. (To date, none of those funds have been paid out to residents.)

In important ways, the water crisis had its roots in the kind of cost-cutting policy approaches that Trump favors. In 2014, officials in Flint made the fateful decision to switch the city’s primary water source from Lake Huron, one of the Great Lakes, to the Flint River. At the time, the city was under the de facto leadership of Darnell Earley, an “emergency manager” who had been appointed by the state’s Republican governor, Rick Snyder. The decision from Earley, an unelected bureaucrat, was part of a broad set of austerity measures curated by the state’s Republican leadership to address the city’s chronic budget shortfalls. The city’s engineering plan to reroute its water supply went through a porous, truncated assessment, little public debate, and relied on a workforce weakened by parallel environmental programming cuts across the city and state.

Within days, residents began raising concerns — the tap water was pungent, murky and had an unsavory taste. Local public works officials largely ignored or downplayed the worries, telling residents that the water source switch would simply have some innocuous growing pains. And then residents began reporting that the water appeared to be giving them skin rashes and causing hair loss. Even leaders at General Motors chimed in, eventually telling the state that it was shutting off the new water at one of its factories due to the water corroding its manufacturing materials. Seeking to avoid upsetting by far the city’s largest employer, the state soon switched the automaker’s factory back to the city’s original water source. But it didn’t change it back for residents.

It wasn’t until nearly two years later that the true scope of the crisis was evident. The flashpoint was a local pediatrician reporting an abnormal spike in lead levels in the blood of the city’s children. What followed was a flurry of media attention, a begrudging statement of acknowledgment from the state on the burgeoning crisis, and President Barack Obama declaring a state of emergency in Flint.

Since then, an unusually seamless level of coordination between federal, state and local officials and private philanthropy has resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars being funneled to Flint for causes ranging from water infrastructure upgrades to early education programming. Over the last four years, lead levels in Flint’s water have consistently tested within scientifically acceptable ranges. And highly innovative, progressive programs like the RxKids program, which provides direct cash assistance to pregnant women and new mothers in Flint, were launched in direct response to the crisis.

However, those positive developments belie the scale of destruction that the water crisis has otherwise wrought, destruction that’s about to get worse if the Trump administration follows through on its plans.

Just this week, Michigan officials announced the completion of a gargantuan, oft-delayed effort to replace Flint’s lead pipes — more than 11 years after the crisis began.

In the interim, Flint’s suffering continued. The city shed roughly a fifth of its population, about 20,000 residents, along with a substantial chunk of its already shrinking and low-wage-earning tax base. These startling changes in density directly impact the ability of the city to adequately support its remaining population; the city now lacks the resources it needs to tend to its infrastructure, public health and education systems.

Researchers like me have been laser-focused on the potential consequences of elevated exposure to lead on Flint residents, particularly children and pregnant women in the city who would be uniquely vulnerable. In the environmental sciences, lead looms large as an invisible, odorless and tasteless neurotoxin that is deeply associated with conditions like cognitive delays, physical impairment, autism and ADHD. For these reasons, as well as its incurability, scientists increasingly regard lead asa key force in social and economic inequality.

In research from my team that was conducted in 2019, five years after the crisis started, Flint residents reported a significant uptick in neurological and developmental issues among their adolescent children. Another group of researchers found that fertility rates in Flint dipped by 12 percent and that overall health at birth decreased. And roughly 29 percent of Flint adultsthat we surveyed showed heightened signs of posttraumatic stress disorder in relationship to the water crisis. These are just a few of the harrowing results of studies conducted in Flint in the aftermath of one of the nation’s most tragic — and preventable — environmental disasters.

Yet these kinds of social, economic and environmental inequities are exactly what the Trump administration doesn’t want to address, or that they believe will magically disappear when manufacturing makes its triumphant return — making the forecast for recovery for Flint and its residents much more concerning. Some of the negative consequences are already showing up.

In March, the Environmental Protection Agency highlighted plans to roll back protections under the Clean Water Act that set pollution limits and aid monitoring efforts. Inexplicably, the EPA is currently in the midst of its third extension to decide if it’ll support the lead and copper regulations that were strengthened by the Biden administration in response to lessons learned from Flint’s water crisis. And with Trump’s new prohibitions now in place on the funding of research and programs addressing environmental injustice — of which the water crisis in Flint is emblematic — dozens of previously awarded grants to Flint researchers and community groups are susceptible to truncation or complete defunding. In March, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy indicated that the Department of Transportation would be eliminating a Biden-era request for state agencies to consider social justice and environmental concerns in infrastructure project decisions, making communities like Flint deeply vulnerable — again — to both manmade and natural environmental crises.

Trumponomics’ impacts also extend to Flint’s public education system, which is currently poised to lose roughly $15.6 million in federal funding due to the Department of Education’s recent decision to cancel Covid relief funds that were previously set to expire in 2026. Along with Trump’s proposed elimination of the Department of Education, which is vital for providing guidance and support on programming for children with disabilities (including those caused by lead exposure), cuts of this nature are poised to deal another blow to early education support in Flint as the volume of children needing it likely significantly increases.

In 2018, officials launched the Flint Registry, a tool that not only aids Flint residents in finding health services and programs, but also serves as a crucial data repository for tracking health outcomes in the city, enabling researchers and practitioners to better understand the consequences of the crisis and improve their response to it. The registry, whose vital work has stalled due to Trump’s orders, was funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Trump administration plans to cleave the CDC’s workforce by roughly 18 percent, including ing some 2,400 employees who focused on environmental monitoring as well as grant administration and support.

It’s unclear whether somewhere in the hazy future, Trump’s gambles with tariffs will restore manufacturing in places like Flint. While campaigning in 2016, Trump, who visited Flint twice during his initial presidential run and once during his latest run, once observed, “It used to be, cars were made in Flint and you couldn’t drink the water in Mexico. Now, the cars are made in Mexico and you can’t drink the water in Flint.”

His quip wasn’t far off, but a larger point was missed. Tariffs might restart some level of domestic manufacturing, but without deeper investment in our social and public health infrastructure, cities like Flint won’t recover and will remain unable to offer its residents either manufacturing jobs or clean water — or much else.",https://static.politico.com/54/31/5b927a874de4afd6061ab6a9432b/mag-ezell-rustbelt.jpg,N,,2025-07-06 16:06:08.118497

While some local officials blamed what they said were faulty forecasts from the National Weather Service—which has been hit hard by staffing cuts ordered by the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency in line with Project 2025—meteorologists and climate scientists including Daniel Swain of the University of California, Los Angeles have refuted such allegations, citing multiple NWS warnings of potentially deadly flooding.

As Jeff Masters and Bob Henson wrote Saturday for Yale Climate Connections:

Many studies have confirmed that human-caused climate change is making the heaviest short-term rainfall events more intense, largely by warming the world's oceans and thus sending more water vapor into the atmosphere that can fuel heavy rain events. Sea surface temperatures this week have been as much as 1°F below the 1981-2010 average for early July in the western Gulf [of Mexico] and Caribbean, but up to 1°F above average in the central Gulf. Long-term human-caused warming made the latter up to 10 times more likely, according to the Climate Shift Index from Climate Central.

House passes bill that will also eliminate fines for carmakers failing to hit fuel economy standards.

Posted on 07 July, 2025

Tax credits designed to incentivise the uptake of EVs in the United States will be axed from the end of September after a wide-ranging bill was passed by the US Congress.

The House of Representatives voted 218 to 214 on July 3 (US time) to pass President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill”, which is designed to cut taxes and spending.

It will mark an end to many Biden-era incentives and includes ditching the US$7,500 (about NZ$12,300) new EV tax credit and the US$4,000 used EV tax credit after September 30.

Dealers and carmakers had hoped for a longer timeframe for phasing out the credits, which have been cited by consumers as a key reason for buying EVs over the past 18 months.

The new bill will also eliminate fines for manufacturers that fail to meet certain fuel economy standards, reports Automotive News.

Not due to any technical glitch or water shortage, but simply because their cooling rivers were too warm to use safely.

It sounds strange — almost backwards — but yes, a power plant can overheat when the river meant to cool it gets too hot itself. But what happened in France and Switzerland is rewriting the rules about where and how we produce energy. This is what happens when the system that relies on for climate solutions begins to stumble under the weight of climate itself.

Too hot to cool, when rivers become a risk

In July, engineers at the Golfech plant in southern France had no choice but to shut things down. The nearby Garonne River had crept past 28°C, the legal limit for drawing cooling water, and even the seawater wasn’t safe to use.

In Switzerland, business operators also face the same dilemma, with air temperatures climbing past 25° Celsius for several days, and they were taken offline one after the other.

Most nuclear plants require cool water to maintain the reactors within safe operating limits.

The system is simple, with the strategy being to repel water from a nearby river, run it through the plant, and return it downstream slightly warmer.

But when the river’s already running warm, even a small spike can push ecosystems out of balance — and make plant operations risky fast.

It’s not the first time, but it’s more frequent.

Something similar happened back in 2018. Heatwaves forced several plants across France, Sweden, and Germany offline — and now it’s starting to feel less like an exception. A year later, it happened again. France’s Rhône and Rhine-cooled plants reduced output during another scorching summer just to avoid overheating the river.

In 2022, France is already dealing with major maintenance delays across its ageing reactors. When heatwaves struck in July and August, five plants received emergency waivers to continue operating despite exceeding temperature limits, and regulators framed this as a last resort and a matter of public necessity.

In 2025 Switzerland learning from the past 25° Celsius while France still navigated public debate after the 2022 exemptions this time.

The science has not changed; the climate has, and it has higher stakes. This has become part of a seasonal routine, discussed alongside wildfire alerts and water restrictions.

The difference is that energy doesn’t burn out; it fades quietly. When huge amounts catch up to infrastructure that was designed for a cooler path.

Green power needs climate protection

If climate change is reshaping the seasons, then the systems that were built decades ago, even the ones meant to fight that change, will have to evolve.

To rethink the infrastructure and update the assumptions, we must prepare for the reality that our energy future won’t just be carbon-free, but also climate-proof. If rising sea temperatures increase, it can compromise the power plant. The problem isn’t just the plan, it’s how we’ve left the redesign.",https://cdn.euroweeklynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-2025-07-06T181541.417.png,N,,2025-07-06 15:05:40.087814

The analysis begins by examining the impact of AI development on energy efficiency (EE), with regression results presented in Table 2.
First, it replaces the CCR model-derived measure of energy efficiency with a single-factor energy efficiency (EE) measure81.","In recent decades, as globalization has accelerated and environmental challenges have intensified, sustainable development has emerged as a shared global priority1. In 2015, the United Nations launched the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), urging countries to align economic growth with environmental responsibility and aiming for substantial progress by 2030 to ensure a safer and more equitable future2. Among these goals, energy efficiency plays a pivotal role in achieving sustainable development3,4. In the face of rising geopolitical tensions5 intensifying climate change6 and growing uncertainty, the efficient use of energy has become essential for national development.

Extensive research has identified multiple determinants of energy efficiency, including financial development7,8 carbon emission trading9,10,11 fiscal decentralization12 manufacturing agglomeration13,14 and policy uncertainty15. These factors, grounded in diverse theoretical frameworks, influence energy efficiency through different mechanisms. More recently, digital technologies have attracted growing scholarly attention for their transformative impact on energy systems. Technological advancements are reshaping energy production, operations, and transmission processes. Within the broader context of sustainable development, digital innovation is accelerating the transition toward greener, low-carbon practices16. These technologies have been shown to enhance energy efficiency, modernize energy infrastructure, and restructure energy consumption patterns16,17,18. Drawing on the theory of technological innovation, several studies underscore the beneficial effects of digital transformation—highlighting its role in upgrading industrial structures, optimizing energy use, and improving overall efficiency19. However, some scholars caution that the development of digital infrastructure may also entail adverse environmental consequences, potentially undermining sustainability objectives6. Among the emerging technologies, artificial intelligence (AI) has distinguished itself as a transformative driver of future innovation. In 2022, the number of AI-related patents granted annually has surpassed 62,000—more than seven times the figure recorded in 2018. By the end of 2023, AI systems had equaled or exceeded human performance on standardized assessments in domains such as image classification, basic reading comprehension, natural language reasoning, multilingual understanding, and visual reasoning. Only in areas such as visual common-sense reasoning and complex mathematical problem-solving does AI still lag behind human capabilities (Artificial Intelligence Index Report, 2024).

The integration of AI into the energy sector is increasingly recognized for its transformative potential to accelerate the transition to sustainable energy sources and enhance energy efficiency. Through advanced data analytics, predictive modeling, and automation, AI facilitates smarter decision-making, optimizes energy distribution, and promotes the adoption of renewable energy technologies, thereby contributing to a more resilient and sustainable energy system20,21,22. Proponents argue that AI is reshaping the landscape of energy management and sustainability, driving high-quality urban development and generating measurable environmental benefits, including improved energy efficiency and enhanced ecological outcomes23,24. However, despite these advantages, the energy-intensive nature of AI technologies poses potential risks to overall energy efficiency. Training and operating AI models require substantial computational resources25 which can lead to increased carbon dioxide emissions and environmental degradation19,26. Furthermore, the dependence of AI systems on massive datasets indirectly amplifies the carbon footprint of the information technology sector. For example, data centers in the United States alone account for approximately 2% of national energy consumption. Globally, projections suggest that by 2030, the energy consumption of the information and communication technology (ICT) sector could reach 20% of total energy use, underscoring its growing role in the global energy landscape17,27.

Given the rapid advancement of AI and its dual potential to both transform and challenge sustainable energy use, empirical investigation into its effects is critical. This study centers on China, offering valuable insights into the relationship between AI development and energy efficiency. According to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (China), the country’s AI industry exceeded 500 billion RMB by 2023, encompassing over 4,500 enterprises. As the world’s largest energy consumer and a leading developing nation28,29 China’s pursuit of energy efficiency holds significant implications for global sustainability, particularly for other developing economies. The rapid growth of AI in China presents a unique opportunity to assess its impact and to explore pathways for integrating AI into sustainable development strategies.

Previous studies have predominantly relied on metrics such as the number of industrial robots or AI-related patent applications to assess AI development30,31,32 often focusing on production processes and technological innovation. While informative, these metrics tend to emphasize specific technologies and their direct effects on energy consumption, potentially overlooking AI’s broader and more systemic influence across sectors. To address this gap, this study employs a fixed-effects model using prefecture-level data from Chinese cities to evaluate the relationship between AI development and energy efficiency.

This research advances the literature in four key ways: (1) Unlike prior studies that use proxies such as industrial robots or patent counts, we assess the influence of AI enterprises, offering a more robust reflection of the practical and commercial dimensions of AI implementation. (2) Moving beyond simplistic indicators like the energy-to-GDP ratio, we adopt a Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model based on the Charnes–Cooper–Rhodes (CCR) approach, allowing for a nuanced assessment of energy efficiency across multiple inputs and outputs. (3) We investigate the pathways through which AI impacts energy efficiency, providing an in-depth understanding of the mediating mechanisms that drive these effects. (4) By investigate the functional boundaries of AI in influencing energy efficiency, we offer a clearer picture of its potential scope. By addressing these research gaps, the study delivers critical insights into the direct effects of AI on energy efficiency, especially by unpacking the mechanisms that link AI development with sustainable energy outcomes. The findings offer actionable strategies for policymakers and industry stakeholders, fostering evidence-based decision-making in the integration of AI technologies to support global sustainability goals.

The structure of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents a comprehensive review of the literature and introduces the theoretical hypotheses. Section 3 describes the data sources and research methodology. Section 4 reports the results of the empirical analysis. Section 5 provides extended analysis, focusing on the moderating effects. Finally, Section 6 summarizes the key conclusions and discusses the policy implications and limitations of the study.

Literature review

Key driver of energy efficiency

Efficient and renewable energy systems have been widely recognized as essential contributors to sustainable development by strengthening environmental governance33. Numerous studies have investigated the factors influencing energy efficiency. Among these, environmental considerations have played a pivotal role in shaping financial strategies—particularly through green finance policies, which allocate capital to environmentally sustainable initiatives and lay the groundwork for improved energy performance7,8. Building on this foundation, institutional mechanisms such as carbon trading systems offer market-based incentives to reduce emissions and promote more efficient resource allocation9,10,11. Furthermore, the role of industrial agglomeration has garnered increasing attention. Researchers have found that clustering industries can create economies of scale and generate positive externalities—such as knowledge spillovers—that streamline production processes and enhance energy utilization13,14.

The impact of digital technologies

Recently, , the global shift toward digital transformation—fueled by rapid advancements in digital technologies—has reshaped economic paradigms. Breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and other frontier technologies have emerged as key enablers of innovation and optimization in energy use across diverse sectors19. These advancements not only catalyze economic and social transformation but also foster further technological progress. As a result, growing academic interest is now directed toward understanding how digitalization influences production systems and alters energy consumption patterns.

Within the academic discourse, two divergent perspectives have emerged regarding the impact of digital technologies on energy transition. Proponents of the positive view argue that digital technologies have facilitated high-quality urban development while delivering measurable environmental benefits34. Enhanced innovation capacity35 has improved total factor productivity by optimizing human capital, integrating advanced manufacturing with modern service industries, and implementing cost-reduction strategies36,37, ultimately leading to gains in energy efficiency23,24. However, a contrasting view cautions that technological innovation may also drive-up carbon emissions due to the resource-intensive construction of digital infrastructure, thus exerting adverse effects on the ecological environment19,26.

The impact of AI

Artificial intelligence (AI), as a foundational element of digital technologies, has the potential to profoundly transform energy utilization and enhance efficiency, particularly in the manufacturing sector 21,22,38. Unlike other digital innovations, AI’s core functionalities can be classified into six critical domains: learning, perception, prediction, interaction, adaptation, and reasoning39. For instance, AI’s learning capability allows systems to improve performance over time, thereby increasing operational efficiency and effectiveness. Perception enables the interpretation of complex datasets and dynamic environments, supporting more informed decision-making40. Predictive capabilities facilitate accurate outcome forecasting, which is essential for strategic planning41. Interaction fosters seamless communication between humans and machines, enhancing user engagement and system responsiveness42. Adaptation allows AI systems to respond to novel conditions and tasks, maintaining their relevance and functionality40,43. Finally, reasoning enables AI to draw logical inferences and solve complex problems, effectively augmenting human cognitive capabilities. Empirical studies underscore AI’s impact on energy efficiency. For example, AI-driven ventilation control systems have achieved energy savings of approximately 26% in commercial buildings in the United States44. Unlike conventional digital tools, AI’s ability to autonomously make decisions, recognize patterns, and exhibit “human-like” scientific reasoning enables more nuanced management of production processes, thereby supporting greener manufacturing practices45. Collectively, these capabilities establish AI as a versatile and powerful enabler of innovation and efficiency across diverse industrial and technological domains. Nevertheless, the development and deployment of AI systems are energy-intensive, particularly during manufacturing, model training, and operational phases, potentially resulting in a substantial carbon footprint20.

A growing body of literature explores the complex relationship between AI and energy efficiency, yielding a range of perspectives. Several studies highlight AI’s potential to enhance energy performance, particularly in regions characterized by high levels of green innovation25, and within high-performing organizations where AI integration is more advanced46. However, these benefits are counterbalanced by the substantial energy demands associated with AI model development and training. High-performance computing for algorithm development, training cycles, and data center cooling consumes vast computational resources, contributing to elevated carbon emissions and environmental degradation19,25,26,47. The expansion of digital infrastructure, particularly at scale, exacerbates these challenges, as it entails considerable energy inputs for both construction and maintenance17,28,48,49.

Despite these concerns, AI presents transformative opportunities to address energy-related challenges through predictive analytics, real-time monitoring, and automated control systems. As AI technologies are increasingly adopted across sectors such as manufacturing, transportation, and utilities, they offer sophisticated mechanisms to detect inefficiencies in energy consumption and enable precise, data-driven interventions to enhance operational efficiency50. These applications yield both direct and indirect environmental benefits. For instance, AI can optimize the timely input of production factors to maximize resource utilization51. Furthermore, the integration of intelligent automation within large-scale industrial ecosystems enables production lines to become more flexible, adaptive, self-aware, self-regulating, and capable of autonomous optimization52,53,54. Such advancements significantly reduce resource consumption and promote sustainability, yielding substantial gains in both environmental performance and industrial efficiency.

Literature gap

This literature review synthesizes current scholarship on energy efficiency and offers a comprehensive analysis of its influencing factors. Although considerable research has examined the impact of digital technologies and AI on energy efficiency, several critical gaps remain. Notably, much of the existing literature conflates AI with broader digital technologies, with limited studies isolating AI to examine its distinct effects. Furthermore, prior research often quantifies AI through proxies such as industrial robot density or patent data. In contrast, this paper emphasizes the practical application of AI technologies55,56,57. Additionally, prevailing studies typically assess energy efficiency using a unidimensional framework, such as the ratio of energy input to GDP output. This study adopts a more robust approach by employing the CCR model, which enables a multidimensional assessment of energy efficiency25,56. Most importantly, the underlying mechanisms through which AI influences energy efficiency remain underexplored. These research gaps underscore the need for further empirical investigation—particularly in China, where a nuanced understanding of AI’s role in energy consumption could enhance its applicability in developing economies.

Theoretical background and hypothesis

As outlined above, the relationship between AI and energy efficiency is multifaceted, encompassing both opportunities and challenges. When AI technologies transition from patent registration to real-world deployment, their energy usage dynamics evolve. Practical implementation often leads to system optimization and energy consumption reduction. This implies that AI’s capacity to improve energy efficiency is best realized through active application rather than theoretical modeling alone. In this regard, AI offers a unique advantage by integrating energy efficiency with adaptability, interactivity, and creativity22. This phenomenon aligns with the Solow paradox, which posits that the productivity gains from technological innovation are not immediately apparent but emerge gradually over time58. Innovation theory further supports the view that widespread adoption of AI can lead to significant improvements in productivity and operational efficiency. Given AI’s demonstrated potential to reduce energy consumption and disrupt conventional energy use patterns, this study advances the following hypothesis:

H1: AI development can improve energy efficiency.

Green technological innovation refers to enterprise-driven innovations aimed at conserving energy, reducing emissions, mitigating climate-related environmental damage, and enhancing ecological benefits. These innovations also contribute to the modernization of production technologies59. Empirical evidence suggests that AI development positively influences green innovation outcomes9. From the perspective of technological innovation, green innovation can reduce emissions from fossil fuels while promoting the adoption of renewable energy sources11. While green innovation may increase research and development expenditures, it simultaneously enhances productivity and enables effective management of wastewater, exhaust emissions, and solid waste during manufacturing. The implementation of stringent environmental regulations to stimulate technological innovation can significantly reduce environmental pollution without compromising production efficiency60. Accordingly, this study proposes Hypothesis 2:

H2: AI development enhances energy efficiency through fostering green technological innovation.

Prior research has established that energy intensity varies significantly across industrial sectors and that structural transformation can influence aggregate energy efficiency61. Notably, industrial structure is a critical determinant of carbon emissions. The configuration and composition of industries—particularly their dependence on energy-intensive technologies and processes—substantially shape the overall carbon footprint. As such, industrial restructuring has become increasingly central to sustainable development and climate change mitigation strategies62. Upgrading the industrial structure can reduce total carbon emissions by decreasing the share of high-energy-consuming sectors while expanding low-carbon and renewable energy industries. This structural shift not only curtails emissions but also fosters a more resilient and sustainable economic system, aligning with global efforts to combat climate change and advance environmental sustainability63. Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a catalytic role in driving industrial upgrading by optimizing and reshaping industrial configurations. The widespread deployment of AI is expected to revolutionize traditional technologies, thereby enabling a more rational, efficient, and innovation-driven industrial structure. AI and related innovation technologies accelerate industrial adaptation and advancement by promoting industrial clustering and enhancing operational efficiency through the adoption, integration, and diffusion of new technological paradigms64,65,66,67. Technological progress also generates significant capital reallocation and innovation-driven transformation. On one hand, capital—including physical, human, and institutional—tends to flow out of high-energy-intensive sectors and into knowledge-intensive, low-carbon industries. On the other hand, the advancement of emerging industries—characterized by superior energy efficiency and environmental performance—contributes to overall improvements in energy use. Based on this rationale, the present study proposes the following hypothesis:

H3: AI development boosts energy efficiency by rationalizing the industrial structure.

In exploring the mechanisms through which AI affects energy efficiency, it is equally important to examine the contextual conditions under which its influence may vary. Drawing on the theory of environmental regulation, prior empirical research indicates that such regulations exert a pronounced influence on both firms’ intentions to innovate and their actual innovation behaviors. This suggests that the effectiveness of AI in enhancing energy efficiency may be contingent upon the regulatory environment and the extent to which firms are incentivized to adopt green technologies. Environmental regulations heighten firms’ awareness of ecological concerns and promote engagement in green innovation activities. For instance, stringent policies can enhance firms’ recognition of the importance of environmental responsibility, thereby increasing their motivation to pursue green innovations68. In developing countries—where formal regulatory frameworks are often weak or inconsistently enforced—informal environmental regulation (IER) emerges as a pivotal mechanism for compelling polluters to take corrective action69. We argue that in such contexts, the impact of AI on energy efficiency is likely to be more substantial in environments characterized by higher levels of IER. Social pressure and public scrutiny, as key drivers of informal regulation, can incentivize firms to adopt AI technologies that reduce emissions and improve operational sustainability. These regulatory dynamics may foster a more conducive environment for AI adoption, thereby amplifying its potential to enhance energy efficiency. On this basis, we propose the following hypothesis:

H4: Informal environmental regulation amplifies the positive impact of AI on energy efficiency.

The developmental stage of a city significantly influences the extent to which AI can enhance energy efficiency. In China, approximately 44% of urban areas are classified as resource-based cities—urban centers whose economies rely heavily on the extraction and processing of natural resources such as minerals, water, and forests70. According to the resource curse theory, the finite nature of these resources implies that sustained extraction will eventually lead to their depletion71. Resource-based cities generally follow four developmental stages: growing, mature, declining, and regenerating. Each stage presents distinct challenges and opportunities for energy use and technological adoption. Growing resource-based cities possess abundant resources and are in the early phases of industrial expansion. These cities are increasingly exploring sustainable practices alongside resource development. Mature cities, having reached peak resource output after years of intensive exploitation, face the challenge of balancing economic growth with environmental preservation. Achieving this balance is vital for long-term sustainability, requiring deliberate efforts to mitigate environmental degradation while maintaining economic performance72. Declining resource-based cities confront the compounded challenges of resource exhaustion and economic instability. These cities must transition from a resource-dependent economy to one that is diversified and sustainable. This transition demands innovative policy measures and strategic interventions. AI can play a critical role in this transformation by identifying inefficiencies, optimizing remaining resources, and facilitating the shift toward sustainable practices. In regenerating cities, resource extraction has largely ceased, and efforts focus on ecological restoration and sustainable urban development. For these cities, AI is essential to supporting smart city initiatives, energy management systems, and environmental monitoring, all of which are key to achieving sustainable urban planning73. Empirical research indicates that the digital economy has a pronounced positive effect on energy efficiency in resource-dependent cities. However, this impact is less significant in cities with more diversified economies. The heightened responsiveness of resource-based cities may be attributed to their centralized industrial structures and initially lower energy efficiency baselines74. Consequently, these cities exhibit both a greater capacity and a more urgent need to leverage AI and other innovative technologies to optimize energy use. As natural resources inevitably dwindle, the priorities of resource-based cities evolve across different stages. In the early stages, the emphasis may be on maximizing extraction efficiency, while in later stages, the focus shifts toward sustainability and ecological recovery. Thus, the demand for AI applications to improve energy efficiency varies across stages, with the need becoming most acute in cities experiencing resource depletion and economic decline. Based on this context, we propose the following hypothesis:

H5: The stage of resource development in a resource-based city moderates the impact of AI on energy efficiency.

Figure 1 shows the conceptual framework.

Data source

The focus of our study is on the impact of AI on energy efficiency across Chinese cities. To empirically test our hypotheses, we employ a fixed-effects model using data compiled from five major sources. Because city-level energy consumption data are not publicly available, we follow established methodologies and use nighttime light intensity data from NOAA as a proxy for energy consumption75,76. Official energy data, standardized in tons of standard coal, are drawn from the China Energy Statistical Yearbook to facilitate calculation and comparison. Additional control variables—including GDP, industrial structure, income levels, educational attainment, population density, and demographic composition—are extracted from the China City Statistical Yearbook. AI enterprise data are identified using a keyword extraction technique applied to the business scope descriptions listed in the Tianyancha enterprise database. Furthermore, green patent data sourced from CNIPA provide insight into the level of technological innovation. All continuous variables are logarithmically transformed to stabilize variance and normalize distributions. After data collection and preprocessing, the final dataset comprises 4177 observations spanning the years 2006 to 2020.

Model settings

Drawing on existing research, we employ a two-way fixed effects panel model to control for both individual (city-level) and time-specific effects25. This model offers significant advantages in handling complex panel data by effectively reducing omitted variable bias and enhancing the precision of causal inference. The baseline specification is as follows:

$$\:{\text{E}\text{E}}_{\text{i}\text{t}}=\:{{\upalpha\:}}_{0}+{{\upbeta\:}}_{1}{\text{A}\text{I}}_{\text{i}\text{t}}+{{\upbeta\:}}_{2}{\text{d}\text{e}\text{n}\text{s}\text{i}\text{t}\text{y}}_{\text{i}\text{t}}+{{\upbeta\:}}_{3}{\text{s}\text{t}\text{r}\text{u}\text{c}\text{t}\text{u}\text{r}\text{e}}_{\text{i}\text{t}}+{{\upbeta\:}}_{4}{\text{p}\text{g}\text{d}\text{p}}_{\text{i}\text{t}}+{{\upbeta\:}}_{5}{\text{s}\text{o}2}_{\text{i}\text{t}}+{{\upbeta\:}}_{6}{\text{e}\text{n}\text{e}\text{r}\text{g}\text{y}}_{\text{i}\text{t}}+{{\upmu\:}}_{\text{i}}+{{\upgamma\:}}_{\text{t}}+{{\upepsilon\:}}_{\text{i}\text{t}}$$

(1)

where i denote the city and t the year. The dependent variable, EE, represents energy efficiency, while the key explanatory variable, AI, captures the artificial intelligence development index. Control variables include population density, industrial structure, per capita GDP (pgdp), sulfur dioxide emissions (so2), and energy consumption. City and year fixed effects are denoted by \(\:{{\upmu\:}}_{\text{i}}\) and \(\:{{\upgamma\:}}_{\text{t}}\) respectively.

Description of variables

Explained variable

Energy efficiency is a multifaceted concept with no universally accepted metric. Broadly, it refers to achieving the same level of output or service with reduced energy input—for example, using the ratio of energy consumption to GDP output as a proxy25. However, such single-factor indicators provide a limited, one-dimensional view that neglects interactions among multiple inputs and the presence of multiple outputs77,78.

These indicators typically focus solely on the energy–output relationship, overlooking the influence of other production factors such as labor and capital. To address this limitation, we adopt the CCR model within the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) framework, which evaluates relative efficiency using a non-parametric approach. This model incorporates a broader set of inputs—namely energy, labor, and capital—and a single output (GDP) to estimate each decision-making unit’s (DMU’s) position relative to a production frontier74. This methodology provides a holistic view of energy efficiency by comparing the performance of a DMU with peers that optimize input use for a given output or maximize output for a given level of input79. By integrating both technical and scale efficiency under the assumption of constant returns to scale80 the CCR model captures input–output interactions more comprehensively, providing a more accurate and holistic assessment of energy efficiency. Therefore, we construct our measure of energy efficiency using the CCR model rather than relying on single-factor indicators. For robustness checks, we further construct a measure of total factor energy efficiency using the SBM (Slack-Based Measure) model81,82,83.

Explanatory variable

Prior studies have commonly measured the level of AI development using two main approaches. The first relies on industrial robot data from the International Federation of Robotics (IFR)30,31,32,84,85. While widely used, this method offers only a partial view and fails to capture the full spectrum of AI applications. The second approach uses AI-related patent data as a proxy for AI development. As a direct reflection of technological innovation, patent data enables precise identification of AI-specific technologies and has been increasingly employed to assess technological advancement86,87. Nevertheless, the number of AI-related patents is often used as a proxy for the level of R&D activity and the cumulative technological achievements in the AI domain. However, when examining energy consumption, the number of AI enterprises may serve as a more direct and relevant indicator. This is because enterprise count reflects the degree of industrial agglomeration and the extent to which the AI sector has matured in a given city. A growing number of AI enterprises typically signals the translation of R&D efforts into real-world applications and market-driven innovations25,88. Therefore, compared to patent counts, the number of AI enterprises offers a more comprehensive measure of both innovation output and its practical implementation.

Mediating variables

Green technology innovation (GTI). At the city level, green technology innovation is measured by taking the natural logarithm of the number of green patent applications plus one, to account for the potential of zero values and to normalize the data89.

Industrial Structure Rationalization (ISR). Following prior research, this study adopts the Theil index to evaluate the rationalization of industrial structure by assessing both sectoral coordination and resource allocation efficiency62. The Theil index quantifies disparities in output and employment across sectors, capturing the extent of structural imbalance at the city level, as shown in Eq. (2):

$$\:TL=\sum\:_{i=1}^{n}[\left(\frac{{Y}_{i}}{Y}\right)\text{l}\text{n}(\frac{{Y}_{i}}{{L}_{i}}/\frac{Y}{L}\:\left)\right]$$

(2)

In Eq. (2), TL denotes the Theil index, with Y and L representing total industrial output and labor force, respectively. Yi and Li refer to the output and employment of sector i, where i ranges from 1 to n, the total number of sectors. A lower Theil index approaching zero indicates a more rational industrial structure. This study calculates ISR for 284 cities over the period 2006–2020.

Moderating variables

Informal environment regulation (IER). To assess the moderating role of informal environmental regulation, the study employs a composite index constructed from indicators such as per capita income, population density, age structure, and educational attainment. These variables jointly capture the socio-economic conditions that influence public awareness and pressure for environmental protection, thus serving as proxies for informal regulatory mechanisms operating outside formal institutions.

To explore how informal environmental regulation moderates the impact, this research draws on the methodology of selecting a series of indicators such as income level, educational background, population density, and age structure to measure the extent of informal environmental regulation in cities90,91.

Stage of Resource City (SRC). Based on the National Resource-Based City Sustainable Development Plan (2013), resource-based cities are classified into four developmental stages: Growing, Mature, Declining, and Regenerating. In this study, these stages are numerically coded from 1 to 4, respectively, following the classification framework proposed by previous research70.

Control variables

In addition, we control for several variables commonly identified in the literature as influencing energy efficiency: (1) Population Density (density): Areas with higher population density often exhibit greater energy demand26. Population density is calculated based on the year-end total population57,92. (2) Industrial Structure (structure): This is measured by the share of tertiary industry value added in GDP, capturing the economic composition and its implications for energy use patterns. (3) GDP per Capita (pgdp): Reflecting regional economic development, GDP per capita is associated with higher living standards and greater awareness of sustainability concerns93. It is measured as the per capita GDP of urban residents. (4) Total Energy Consumption (energy): This variable captures the absolute scale of energy usage within a city, serving as a key control for evaluating energy efficiency94. (5) Environmental Pollution (so₂): Given that highly polluted regions often allocate more resources to environmental management, sulfur dioxide (so₂) emissions—one of the most prominent industrial pollutants—are used as a proxy for environmental pressure and are included as a control variable94; therefore, this study controls it, considering the environmental pollution status, and measures it by the amount of sulfur dioxide emissions.

Table 1 outlines the definitions and calculation methods of all variables.

Benchmark regression analysis

Due to the Hausman test results, with a p-value of 0.000, we choose the fixed effects model to control for unobserved individual heterogeneity. The analysis begins by examining the impact of AI development on energy efficiency (EE), with regression results presented in Table 2. Column (1) reports baseline estimates without control variables, while column (2) introduces controls. Column (3) further refines the model by clustering standard errors at both the city and calendar year levels to mitigate potential intra-group error correlation. The progressive increase in R-squared values across columns (1) through (3) indicates improved model fit with the inclusion of controls and robust error adjustments. In all specifications, the coefficient of AI on EE remains positive (0.049) and statistically significant at the 1% level, providing preliminary evidence that AI development positively influences energy efficiency.

Regarding the control variables, the coefficient on population density is positive and significant at the 1% level, suggesting that higher population density is associated with greater energy efficiency. This may be attributable to the intensified economic activity and more diversified industrial structures typically found in densely populated regions. Additionally, such regions often adopt stricter energy efficiency regulations, incentivizing firms to implement advanced energy-saving technologies. Likewise, the coefficient on per capita GDP is both positive and significant at the 1% level, indicating that higher income levels are linked to enhanced energy efficiency. This relationship likely reflects the increased capacity of wealthier regions to invest in technological innovation and R&D, along with heightened public awareness of environmental sustainability and energy conservation.

In contrast, the coefficients for so₂ emissions and total energy consumption are negative, implying that greater pollutant emissions and energy usage are detrimental to energy efficiency. These findings are consistent with empirical patterns observed in real-world contexts.

Robustness checks

Robustness test

To verify the robustness of these results, the study undertakes three validation approaches. First, it replaces the CCR model-derived measure of energy efficiency with a single-factor energy efficiency (EE) measure81. This shift allows us to assess energy efficiency through a more straightforward metric, calculated as the ratio of energy input to economic output10. Although this approach oversimplifies the multidimensional nature of energy performance, it aligns the analysis with conventional metrics frequently used in existing literature, enabling comparability across studies. As shown in column (1) of Table 3, the positive and significant relationship between AI development and EE persists, lending further credibility to the baseline findings.

Second, a subsample analysis is conducted to account for regional heterogeneity. The cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen—China’s leading megacities—exhibit advanced economic development, robust infrastructure, and strong capabilities in AI innovation, placing them well ahead of cities in central and western China, which face structural and infrastructural limitations. To mitigate potential bias introduced by these outliers, a regression is performed after excluding the four first-tier cities. The results, presented in Column (2) of Table 3, are consistent with those of the full sample, further reinforcing the robustness and generalizability of the core conclusions.

Third, the effects of AI development on energy efficiency may exhibit a time lag due to delays in policy interpretation and implementation. To account for this, we introduce one- and two-period lags of AI development as robustness checks, as shown in columns (3) and (4) of Table 3, respectively. The results remain consistent with our baseline findings and provide further empirical support for Hypothesis 1, reaffirming that AI development is positively associated with improvements in urban energy efficiency.

Endogenous processing

To address potential endogeneity, we adopt an instrumental variable (IV) approach. Drawing on established methodologies in the literature, we construct two instruments: (1) a one-period lag of AI development, and (2) a Bartik shift-share instrument. The latter is derived by interacting the lagged first-order AI index with its first-order difference, thereby generating a theoretically grounded IV25,95,96. Table 4 presents the results of the IV regressions, which include the same set of control variables used in the baseline model to mitigate confounding effects. The results demonstrate that AI remains positively and significantly associated with energy efficiency under both IV strategies. Specifically, columns (1) and (3) report the first-stage regression outcomes, confirming a strong correlation between the instruments (IV1 and IV2) and AI. Columns (2) and (4) show the second-stage estimates, where the coefficients on AI are 0.051 and 0.049, respectively, both significant at the 1% level. These findings confirm the robustness and consistency of the main regression results.

Mechanism test

Green technology innovation

Table 5 reports the mediating role of green technological innovation (GTI) in the AI–energy efficiency relationship. Column (1) presents the total effect of AI on energy efficiency, while column (2) shows that AI significantly promotes GTI at the 1% level. This suggests that AI development exerts a substantial and positive influence on the advancement of green technologies, underscoring its capacity to catalyze sustainable innovation. In column (3), when both AI and GTI are regressed on energy efficiency, the coefficient for GTI remains positive and statistically significant at the 5% level. This indicates that GTI contributes to enhancing energy efficiency and functions as a partial mediator. The clustering of AI enterprises appears to foster green innovation, which in turn drives improvements in energy efficiency. These results support Hypothesis 2 regarding the mediating role of GTI.

Rationalization of industrial structure

Table 6 presents the mediating mechanism analysis involving the rationalization of the industrial structure (ISR). Column (1) shows the total effect of AI on energy efficiency, while column (2) reveals that AI significantly promotes ISR at the 1% level, suggesting that AI contributes to industrial upgrading and structural optimization. In column (3), when AI and ISR are jointly regressed on energy efficiency, both variables show positive and statistically significant coefficients at the 1% level. These findings indicate that ISR serves as a significant mediating pathway through which AI enhances energy efficiency. Thus, the results provide empirical support for Hypothesis 3, confirming that AI facilitates energy efficiency improvements by driving the rationalization of the industrial structure.",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-025-09319-x/MediaObjects/41598_2025_9319_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2025-07-06 14:06:58.128809

Ameren’s operations in Illinois face ongoing regulatory uncertainties that could potentially hinder the company’s growth prospects in the state. The regulatory environment in Illinois has been characterized as challenging, with potential impacts on investment returns and operational flexibility.

If these regulatory challenges persist or intensify, Ameren may face difficulties in implementing its capital expenditure plans or achieving desired rate outcomes in Illinois. This could lead to lower-than-expected returns on investments in the state, potentially dragging down the company’s overall financial performance.

Moreover, regulatory uncertainties could increase the cost of capital for Ameren’s Illinois operations, as investors may demand higher risk premiums. This could impact the company’s ability to fund growth initiatives cost-effectively, potentially limiting its expansion plans in the state.

What risks does Ameren face if IRA tax credits are reduced?

Ameren’s growth strategy relies significantly on tax credits and transferability provisions under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). These provisions are crucial for maintaining customer bill affordability while pursuing the company’s ambitious capital expenditure plans.

If these tax credits were to be reduced or eliminated, Ameren could face significant challenges. The company has indicated that a loss of approximately $300 million per year in tax credit monetization could be manageable without requiring additional equity issuances. However, a more substantial reduction in tax credits could necessitate a reevaluation of Ameren’s capital plans or financing strategy.

A reduction in IRA tax credits could also impact Ameren’s ability to invest in renewable energy projects cost-effectively. This could slow down the company’s transition to cleaner energy sources and potentially affect its competitiveness in an increasingly environmentally conscious market.

Bull Case

How could Ameren’s conservative planning lead to outperformance?

Ameren’s approach to financial planning and growth strategy has been characterized as conservative and executable by analysts. This conservative stance could potentially lead to outperformance in several ways.

Firstly, by setting achievable targets and maintaining a buffer in its projections, Ameren positions itself to potentially exceed market expectations. If economic conditions prove more favorable than anticipated or if the company executes its plans more efficiently than projected, it could result in earnings that surpass current estimates.

Secondly, Ameren’s conservative capital plan leaves room for potential upside. The company has indicated that longer-term spending could increase due to economic development opportunities, particularly in the data center sector. If these opportunities materialize to a greater extent than currently factored into projections, it could drive additional growth beyond current expectations.

Lastly, Ameren’s prudent financial management, evidenced by its strong balance sheet and Moody’s Baa1 rating, provides flexibility to capitalize on unexpected growth opportunities or navigate potential challenges without compromising its financial health.

What potential does the MISO Tranche 2 projects hold for Ameren?

The MISO (Midcontinent Independent System Operator) Tranche 2 projects, set to commence in Q3 2025, represent a significant opportunity for Ameren. These projects could potentially drive growth beyond the company’s current capital plan and market expectations.

MISO projects typically involve large-scale transmission infrastructure investments aimed at improving grid reliability and facilitating the integration of renewable energy sources. For Ameren, successful participation in these projects could lead to several benefits:

1. Increased capital deployment opportunities, potentially accelerating rate base growth beyond current projections.

2. Enhanced returns on investment, as transmission projects often come with favorable regulatory treatment.

3. Strengthened market position within the MISO region, potentially leading to future project opportunities.

4. Improved ability to integrate renewable energy sources, aligning with broader decarbonization trends and potentially enhancing Ameren’s environmental profile.

If Ameren secures a significant role in the MISO Tranche 2 projects and executes them successfully, it could provide a substantial boost to the company’s growth trajectory and market valuation.

July is peak flash flood season in the US, and central Texas is known as “flash flood alley” because the necessary ingredients of tropical moisture and slow-moving storms come together often over hilly terrain there.
National Weather Service (NWS) forecasters caution that more floods could come this weekend and into next week.
Nearly 14in of rain fell in five hours just west of Austin, Texas – rains that would be expected just once in nearly 1,000 years given a stable climate.
Barry’s circulation pulled record amounts of atmospheric moisture up to central Texas from the near-record warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico.","The ongoing challenges of forecasting extreme weather during the era of the climate crisis have been brought to the fore again amid catastrophic flash flooding in the “hill country” region of Texas.

As of early Sunday, hundreds of rescuers are searching for at least 12 people still missing as rains taper off outside of San Antonio and Austin. Hundreds of people have already been pulled from floodwaters that have killed nearly 70 people so far, many of them children at a summer camp along the banks of the Guadalupe River.

July is peak flash flood season in the US, and central Texas is known as “flash flood alley” because the necessary ingredients of tropical moisture and slow-moving storms come together often over hilly terrain there. National Weather Service (NWS) forecasters caution that more floods could come this weekend and into next week.

The scale of this latest climate disaster became apparent on Saturday as drone footage taken on Saturday morning showed entire neighborhoods inundated and rushing waters streaming through small town streets. Tales of survival and heartbreak were plentiful.

An initial analysis of the downpours and the decisions by forecasters that led up to them by the Guardian shows that rainfall of this magnitude was exceedingly rare and difficult to predict, even for this flood-prone region.

Friday’s totals of more than 10in (25cm) of rain in three hours could be expected just once in a “typical” 500-year period for Kerrville, Texas – three months’ worth of rain in just a few hours. Radar data show that more than 4in per hour fell during the peak of Friday’s rains. That rainfall intensity was in excess of a similar flash flood in 1987 that also ended in tragedy for campers along the Guadalupe.

Saturday’s rainfall totals actually exceeded Friday’s rainfall for a region slightly north of Friday’s peak rains. Nearly 14in of rain fell in five hours just west of Austin, Texas – rains that would be expected just once in nearly 1,000 years given a stable climate.

Despite funding cuts and widespread staffing shortages implemented by the Trump administration, NWS forecasters in both the local San Angelo office and at the NWS national specialty center responsible for excessive rainfall provided a series of watches and warnings in the days and hours leading up to Friday’s flooding disaster.

The forecast office in San Angelo has two current vacancies – typical for the pre-Trump era and fewer than the current average staff shortage across the NWS – and has not been experiencing any lapses in weather balloon data collection that have plagued some other offices.

In fact, weather balloon data gathered on Thursday from Del Rio showed record amounts of moisture present in the upper atmosphere above central Texas and added to the confidence that severe flash flooding was possible. The Del Rio office then began issuing a series of flood watches starting on Thursday afternoon that cautioned the region to prepare for “excessive runoff” from “5 to 7 inches of rain”.

The NWS’s Weather Prediction Center, based in College Park, Maryland, also issued a series of mesoscale precipitation discussions on Thursday – highly detailed advance notices to other weather forecasters that a particularly rare event might be underway. In one of the discussions, forecasters noted that moisture content in central Texas was “above the 99th climatological percentile” – far in excess of normal and a clue that historic flooding was possible.

In a final escalation, the NWS office in San Angelo issued a flash flood emergency about an hour before the water started rapidly rising beyond flood stage at the closest US Geological Survey river monitoring gauge. A flash flood emergency is the highest level of flood warning available to the NWS, and sufficient to set off the Wireless Emergency Alert system, which would have triggered cellphone alarms in the region.

The National Weather Service issued dozens of additional flash flood warnings throughout the day on Friday and Saturday after the second wave of extremely heavy rains compounded the flooding’s scope across central Texas during the early morning hours.

Even though watches and warnings were issued on time throughout the disaster – contrasting what local officials have said in press conferences – rainfall totals specified in the first flash flood watch were about half of what ultimately fell.

Current weather forecasting technology is capable of knowing that near-record rainfall may occur somewhere in a given region about a day in advance, but knowing exactly how much and in which part of a specific river’s drainage basin over hilly terrain makes flood forecasting much more difficult – analogous to prediction exactly which neighborhood a tornado might strike a day ahead of time. Donald Trump’s staffing cuts have particularly hit the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Environmental Modeling Center, which aims to improve the skill of these types of difficult forecasts.

Though it’s unclear to what extent staffing shortages across the NWS complicated the advance notice that local officials had of an impending flooding disaster, it’s clear that this was a complex, compound tragedy of a type that climate warming is making more frequent.

Rainfall intensity in central Texas has been trending upward for decades, and this week’s rains were enhanced by the remnants of Tropical Storm Barry, which made landfall in northern Mexico last week. Barry’s circulation pulled record amounts of atmospheric moisture up to central Texas from the near-record warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico.",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/155a65f3df3278e26e360a359ba59c6abc081b64/543_0_3333_2667/master/3333.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=64b1f4e2007f2f8bab52900bbeb21d65,N,,2025-07-06 14:07:41.495412

In a stunning shift in the automotive landscape, Chinese EV and battery titan BYD is now dominating the market, with sales nearly tripling those of its American rival. As BYD floods global markets with a diverse and affordable lineup, Tesla, grappling with an aging product line and brand turmoil, is pivoting its focus from cars to a high-stakes future of robotaxis and artificial intelligence.

A Tale of Two Fortunes: Sales and Profits Diverge

The numbers tell a stark story. In the second quarter, BYD sold a staggering 1.145 million electric vehicles, a 16% increase year-over-year. Its sales of all-battery electric vehicles (BEVs) alone shot up 45.8% to over 606,000 units, marking the third consecutive quarter that it has handily outsold Tesla.

Meanwhile, Tesla’s deliveries fell 13.5% to 384,122 vehicles in the same period. This trend extends to the bottom line, where the two companies are on opposite trajectories. While Tesla’s Q1 earnings plunged by 40%, BYD’s net income boomed by over 100%, surpassing Tesla’s for the first time—a clear sign of a power shift. This divergence is fueled by Tesla’s reliance on a few aging models versus BYD’s relentless rollout of new vehicles across all price points, from sub-$10,000 city cars to $150,000 luxury models.

Tesla’s Gambit: A Pivot to Autonomy Amidst Crisis

Facing fierce competition and a damaged brand image, partially linked to CEO Elon Musk’s polarizing political activities, Tesla is facing significant headwinds. A critical blow is the new U.S. legislation ending EV tax credits after September 30, which is set to severely impact sales and profitability. The once-lucrative zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) credits, a major profit driver for Tesla, have also been eliminated.

In response, Musk is betting the company’s future not on new cars, but on autonomy. Tesla recently launched a limited, invite-only robotaxi service in Austin, Texas. However, the initial rollout has been modest, operating in a small, heavily mapped area with human “safety monitors” still in the vehicles. An incident involving a minor accident has tempered expectations, suggesting the road to true, unsupervised self-driving is still long. Musk’s other futuristic bets, like the Optimus humanoid robot, have also reportedly faced setbacks and redesigns.

Compounding these challenges is Musk’s renewed political activism, including a feud with President Donald Trump and his vow to form a new “America Party,” which threatens to further alienate customers and invite regulatory scrutiny.

BYD’s Strategy: Relentless Innovation and Global Domination

While Tesla looks to the future, BYD is conquering the present. The Chinese automaker is leveraging its status as a vertically integrated powerhouse—making its own batteries, chips, and components—to wage an aggressive price war, offering discounts up to 34% in its home market.

BYD is also innovating at a blistering pace. It has begun rolling out advanced driver-assist systems (ADAS) across its entire lineup at no extra charge and recently unveiled technology that allows its EVs to be fully charged in as little as five minutes.

Crucially, BYD is succeeding where Tesla has struggled: global expansion. With surging overseas sales, new factories planned for Hungary and Turkey to bypass EU tariffs, and plants ramping up in Brazil and Thailand, BYD is cementing its position as a worldwide force. The one market it continues to avoid is the U.S., citing political opposition and high tariffs.

The Road Ahead: A High-Stakes Wager

The contrast between the two EV giants could not be clearer. BYD is executing a classic manufacturing and market-share strategy, overwhelming competitors with volume, variety, and value. Tesla, on the other hand, is asking investors to look past its current struggles and believe in a multitrillion-dollar vision of autonomous vehicles and AI.

While Tesla’s stock (TSLA) still commands a massive $1.02 trillion market cap—largely based on its self-driving promises—it has been a loser in 2025. BYD’s stock (BYDDF), despite a recent dip due to the price war, is up significantly for the year.

The electric vehicle world is now watching a fascinating high-stakes wager: Will Elon Musk’s bet on a robotic future pay off, or will BYD’s relentless focus on building and selling cars today create an insurmountable lead? For now, the crown has slipped, and BYD is firmly in the driver’s seat.",https://www.dailychhattisgarh.com/latest/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/stock-23-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-06 15:04:52.383308

The company's stock has long been a barometer of investor confidence in the EV transition, but a perfect storm of regulatory headwinds, leadership distraction, and political turmoil now threatens its prospects. As Elon Musk's pivot to politics collides with the loss of federal EV tax credits, the question is no longer whether Tesla can sustain growth—but whether its valuation still makes sense.

Regulatory Headwinds: The Tax Credit Phase-Out and Supply Chain Challenges

The most immediate risk stems from the loss of federal EV tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Starting in 2023, Tesla began excluding certain models like the Model S and X due to their high price tags exceeding IRS caps ($55,000 for sedans and $80,000 for SUVs/pickups). By 2025, stricter battery sourcing rules—requiring 80% of critical minerals to come from North America—have further limited eligibility.

The impact is clear: Tesla's U.S. sales growth has slowed as buyers lose up to $7,500 in incentives. shows a decline in 2024, with the most affected models being higher-priced vehicles. Analysts estimate that Tesla lost over 10% of potential buyers in key markets due to the credit phase-out, a blow to margins already pressured by rising battery costs.

Leadership Distraction: Musk's Political Pivot

Elon Musk's July 5, 2025, announcement of the America Party—a direct challenge to Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act—has amplified concerns about his focus on Tesla. The feud with Trump, rooted in Musk's opposition to a $3 trillion spending bill, has escalated into personal attacks. Trump has threatened to cut federal subsidies for Tesla and even hinted at legal action, citing Musk's prior role in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) as leverage.

reveals a decline of nearly 20% in the weeks following the America Party's launch, as investors grew wary of Musk's dual role as tech mogul and political agitator. Analysts at Baird recently downgraded Tesla to “Underperform,” citing “diversion of leadership attention” as a key risk.

Market Sentiment: A Trust Deficit

The fallout isn't just about Musk's time. The political drama has fueled skepticism about Tesla's ability to navigate U.S. regulatory environments. Trump's threats to cut subsidies—whether through reduced tax credits or infrastructure grants—could further squeeze margins. Meanwhile, Musk's alignment with the America Party risks alienating bipartisan support for EVs, a sector that thrives on cross-aisle consensus.

Investor sentiment is also wobbling. Tesla's stock trades at a price-to-sales ratio of 1.8x, down from 3.5x in 2021, suggesting some re-pricing of risks. But does it go far enough? Musk's political gamble could lead to unintended consequences: foreign investors may retreat, fearing U.S. regulatory overreach, while domestic buyers grow uncertain about Tesla's long-term viability.

The Triple Threat: Can Tesla Survive?

Regulatory Risk: Tesla's reliance on high-margin, high-priced models like the Cybertruck makes it vulnerable to IRA caps. Without tax credits, these vehicles become less competitive against rivals like Ford's F-150 Lightning (still eligible for credits).

Leadership Risk: Musk's political activities demand time and energy. His role in DOGE and now the America Party signals a shift away from operational oversight, raising red flags about Tesla's ability to execute on its $30,000 “Gen 5” car roadmap.

Sentiment Risk: The feud with Trump could trigger legislative pushback, such as stricter emissions rules or subsidies for rival automakers.

Investment Implications: Time to Reassess

Is Tesla's current valuation (around $350 billion as of June 2025) pricing in these risks? Perhaps not fully. While the stock has retreated from all-time highs, the market still assumes Tesla will dominate the EV market indefinitely—a risky bet given the triple threat.

Investors should ask:

- Can Tesla meet the IRA's North American battery sourcing rules by 2029, or will it face penalties?

- How much will Musk's political activities divert focus from Tesla's core business?

- Will the America Party's rise amplify regulatory scrutiny of Musk's other ventures (SpaceX, Neuralink)?

For now, the safest bet is caution. While Tesla remains a leader in EV innovation, its stock is increasingly a play on Musk's ability to juggle CEO and political roles—a high-risk proposition.

shows a growing chorus of downgrades, with just 12% of analysts rating the stock a “Buy.” For investors, this is a signal to reduce exposure or wait for clearer skies.

(NYSE: ), the global automotive manufacturer formed from the merger of Fiat (BIT: ) Chrysler Automobiles and PSA Group, finds itself at a critical juncture as it navigates a complex landscape of challenges and opportunities. According to InvestingPro data, the company’s stock has taken a significant hit, declining over 15% in the past six months. Recent analyst reports have painted a mixed picture of the company’s prospects, with concerns about US auto tariffs and structural issues in North America balanced against potential for a strategic turnaround under new leadership. Despite these challenges, InvestingPro analysis suggests the stock may be undervalued at current levels.

Financial Performance and Outlook

Stellantis’s financial outlook has come under scrutiny, with analysts projecting significant headwinds in the coming years. While InvestingPro data shows the company maintains profitability with a P/E ratio of 4.61x and pays a substantial 5.74% dividend yield, earnings estimates for 2025 and 2026 have been revised downward, with some analysts forecasting figures 40-45% below consensus. The company’s revenue has declined 17.23% over the last twelve months, reflecting these challenges.

The North American market, traditionally a stronghold for the company, is expected to face particular challenges. Analysts anticipate a potential €1 billion loss in this region for 2025, contrasting sharply with the consensus expectation of a €1.6 billion profit.

Free Cash Flow (FCF) has emerged as a major concern for investors. InvestingPro data confirms the company is quickly burning through cash, with negative FCF yield at -29%. Analysts project negative FCF of over €3 billion in both 2025 and 2026, following a substantial €6 billion cash burn in the previous year. This trend raises questions about the company’s ability to fund necessary investments and maintain shareholder returns in the near term.

The valuation of Stellantis stock has also come under scrutiny. According to InvestingPro, the stock currently trades at just 4.61 times earnings and 0.3 times book value, suggesting potential undervaluation. While some analysts argue about historical comparisons, InvestingPro’s comprehensive Fair Value analysis provides additional insights into the stock’s true worth.

Strategic Challenges and Opportunities

Stellantis faces several strategic challenges, particularly in its North American operations. The company is considered over-capitalized in this region relative to its scale, necessitating a multi-year turnaround effort. Management’s ability to regain scale through pricing strategies or new product introductions is seen as crucial. However, recent product launches have focused on niche segments and are manufactured outside the United States, potentially exposing the company to tariff-related challenges.

The appointment of a new CEO, Antonio Filosa, is viewed as a potential catalyst for change. Analysts expect swift decisions to enhance competitiveness and implement a credible turnaround plan for the North American truck business. Strategic alliances with Chinese OEMs and investments in multi-energy platforms are seen as key growth drivers that could help Stellantis navigate the transition to electric vehicles (EVs) and improve its global market position.

North American Market Dynamics

The North American market presents significant challenges for Stellantis. The company is currently operating at approximately 50% capacity utilization in the United States, highlighting the need for operational restructuring. The introduction of 25% US auto tariffs has exacerbated these challenges, disproportionately affecting Stellantis due to its high percentage of imported vehicles sold in the US market.

Analysts estimate that restructuring and reshoring costs for the North American business could reach €4 billion. This substantial investment is seen as necessary to improve competitiveness but will likely impact profitability in the short to medium term. The success of these efforts will be critical in determining Stellantis’s ability to regain market share in a shrinking US automotive market.

Product Portfolio and Brand Strategy

Stellantis’s product portfolio and brand strategy are undergoing significant changes as the company seeks to address market challenges. Recent product launches have focused on niche segments, which may limit the company’s ability to drive volume growth in key markets. Analysts note that many of these new products are manufactured outside the United States, potentially exposing them to tariff-related challenges in the crucial North American market.

The company is in the process of resetting its brands and production capacity, with potential alliances seen as a way to ease capacity cuts. Stellantis aims to leverage its global footprint and cost leadership to improve its competitive position across various market segments. However, the company faces ongoing challenges in rebuilding its asset base and transitioning from internal combustion engine (ICE (NYSE: )) vehicles to EVs.

Operational Efficiency and Cost Management

Stellantis’s management has emphasized cost leadership and operational efficiency as key pillars of its strategy. The company aims to achieve an operating margin range of 6-8% and generate free cash flow of €5-6 billion in the medium term. To reach these targets, Stellantis is focusing on leveraging its global manufacturing footprint and implementing cost-saving measures across its operations.

Analysts highlight the company’s strong capital efficiency and low-cost manufacturing capabilities as potential advantages in a highly competitive industry. However, the success of these initiatives will depend on management’s ability to execute effectively, particularly in the face of ongoing market challenges and the need for significant investments in new technologies.

Global Market Positioning

While Stellantis faces significant challenges in North America, its global market positioning presents both opportunities and risks. The company maintains a strong presence in Europe and has potential for growth in emerging markets. However, analysts warn of long-term risks in regions such as the Middle East, Africa, and South America, where margin normalization may occur due to increasing competition from Chinese OEMs.

Stellantis’s lack of progress in its China strategy and struggles with premium brands are cited as areas of concern that could impact overall performance. The company’s ability to successfully navigate these diverse global markets will be crucial in offsetting challenges in North America and achieving sustainable growth.

Technological Advancements and EV Transition

As the automotive industry undergoes a significant transition towards electrification, Stellantis’s investments in multi-energy platforms and EV technologies are seen as critical for future competitiveness. The company is focusing on building competitive platforms that can support a range of powertrain options, including fully electric vehicles.

However, analysts note that Stellantis faces risks associated with the transition from ICE to EVs, including potential market share loss and the need for substantial capital investments. The company’s ability to execute its technological roadmap effectively while managing costs will be a key factor in determining its long-term success in an increasingly electrified automotive landscape.

Bear Case

How will US auto tariffs impact Stellantis’s profitability?

The implementation of 25% US auto tariffs poses a significant threat to Stellantis’s profitability, particularly in its North American operations. As a company with a high percentage of imported vehicles sold in the US market, Stellantis is disproportionately affected compared to its Detroit-based competitors. These tariffs are expected to severely impact the company’s cost structure, potentially leading to losses in the North American market.

Analysts project that the tariffs could result in a €1 billion loss for Stellantis in North America for 2025, contrasting sharply with the previous consensus expectation of a €1.6 billion profit. This dramatic swing underscores the magnitude of the tariff impact on the company’s financial performance. Furthermore, the additional costs associated with tariffs may force Stellantis to either raise prices, potentially reducing market share, or absorb the costs, further eroding profitability.

The tariff situation also complicates Stellantis’s product strategy. Recent product launches have focused on niche segments and are manufactured outside the US, making them particularly vulnerable to tariff-related challenges. This may limit the company’s ability to introduce competitive new products in the US market, further hampering its efforts to regain market share and improve profitability.

Can Stellantis overcome its structural challenges in North America?

Stellantis faces significant structural challenges in its North American operations that may prove difficult to overcome in the near term. The company is considered over-capitalized in the region relative to its scale, operating at approximately 50% capacity utilization in the United States. This inefficiency contributes to higher fixed costs and reduced profitability.

Addressing these structural issues will require a multi-year turnaround effort, including substantial investments in restructuring and reshoring. Analysts estimate that these costs could reach €4 billion for the North American business alone. Such a significant outlay will likely strain the company’s financial resources and may impact its ability to invest in other critical areas, such as new product development and electrification efforts.

Moreover, Stellantis’s efforts to regain scale through pricing or new product introductions face headwinds in a shrinking US automotive market. The company’s focus on niche segments and products manufactured outside the US may limit its ability to drive volume growth and improve capacity utilization. Without a successful turnaround of its North American truck business and a credible plan to address overcapacity, Stellantis may struggle to achieve sustainable profitability in this crucial market.

Bull Case

How might a new CEO turnaround Stellantis’s performance?

The appointment of Antonio Filosa as Stellantis’s new CEO presents an opportunity for a strategic reset and potential performance turnaround. Analysts anticipate that Filosa will make swift decisions to enhance the company’s competitiveness and implement a credible plan to address challenges, particularly in the North American market.

A new CEO brings fresh perspectives and the potential for bold strategic moves. Filosa may leverage Stellantis’s global footprint and cost leadership to improve operational efficiency and profitability. This could involve rationalizing the brand portfolio, optimizing production capacity, and accelerating the transition to electric vehicles.

Furthermore, the new leadership may pursue strategic alliances, particularly with Chinese OEMs, to strengthen Stellantis’s position in key markets and access new technologies. Such partnerships could help the company navigate the complexities of the EV transition while potentially easing the burden of capacity cuts in certain regions.

If successful, these initiatives could lead to improved financial performance, with the company aiming for an operating margin range of 6-8% and free cash flow of €5-6 billion in the medium term. A well-executed turnaround strategy under new leadership could potentially drive significant value creation for shareholders and position Stellantis more competitively in the global automotive market.

What potential does Stellantis have for growth in emerging markets?

Despite challenges in mature markets, Stellantis maintains significant potential for growth in emerging markets. The company’s global footprint and diverse brand portfolio position it well to capture opportunities in regions with expanding automotive demand.

Stellantis has a strong presence in markets such as the Middle East, Africa, and South America, where rising incomes and increasing motorization rates could drive sales growth. The company’s ability to offer a range of vehicles across different price points and segments allows it to cater to diverse consumer needs in these markets.

Moreover, Stellantis’s cost leadership and experience in producing affordable vehicles could be particularly advantageous in emerging markets, where price sensitivity is often a key factor in purchasing decisions. By leveraging its global scale and manufacturing expertise, the company may be able to introduce competitive products tailored to local preferences and regulations.

However, realizing this growth potential will require careful navigation of increasing competition, particularly from Chinese OEMs. Stellantis will need to balance the opportunities for expansion with the risk of margin normalization as these markets mature. Successfully executing a targeted emerging market strategy could provide a crucial offset to challenges in more established markets and contribute significantly to the company’s overall growth and profitability.

By KEVIN FREKING and LISA MASCARO – Associated Press

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Friday signed the tax and spending cut bill Republicans muscled through Congress this week, turning it into law by his own self-imposed Fourth of July deadline.

At nearly 900 pages, the legislation is a sprawling collection of tax breaks, spending cuts and other Republican priorities, including new money for national defense and deportations.

Democrats united against the legislation, but were powerless to stop it as long as Republicans stayed united. The Senate passed the bill Tuesday, with Vice President JD Vance casting the tiebreaking vote. The House passed an earlier iteration of the bill in May with just one vote to spare. It passed the final version Thursday 218-214.

Here’s the latest on what’s in the bill and when some of its provisions go into effect.GOP bill includes reductions for businesses and new tax breaks

Republicans say the bill is crucial because there would be a massive tax increase after December when tax breaks from Trump’s first term expire. The legislation contains about $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.

The existing tax rates and brackets would become permanent under the bill, solidifying the tax cuts approved in Trump’s first term.

It temporarily would add new tax deductions on tip, overtime and auto loans. There’s also a $6,000 deduction for older adults who earn no more than $75,000 a year, a nod to his pledge to end taxes on Social Security benefits.

It would boost the $2,000 child tax credit to $2,200. Millions of families at lower income levels would not get the full credit.

A cap on state and local deductions, called SALT, would quadruple to $40,000 for five years. It’s a provision important to New York and other high tax states, though the House wanted it to last for 10 years.

There are scores of business-related tax cuts, including allowing businesses to immediately write off 100% of the cost of equipment and research. Proponents say this will boost economic growth.

The wealthiest households would see a $12,000 increase from the legislation, and the bill would cost the poorest people $1,600 a year, mainly due to reductions in Medicaid and food aid, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office analysis of the House’s version.GOP bill funds the border wall, deportations and a missile shield

The bill would provide some $350 billion for Trump’s border and national security agenda, including for the U.S.-Mexico border wall and for 100,000 migrant detention facility beds, as he aims to fulfill his promise of the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history.

Money would go for hiring 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, with $10,000 signing bonuses and a surge of Border Patrol officers, as well. The goal is to deport some 1 million people per year.

To help pay for it, immigrants would face various new fees, including when seeking asylum protections.

For the Pentagon, the bill would provide billions for ship building, munitions systems, and quality of life measures for servicemen and women, as well as $25 billion for the development of the Golden Dome missile defense system. The Defense Department would have $1 billion for border security.Medicaid, SNAP face deep cuts to fund bill’s tax breaks and spending

To help partly offset the lost tax revenue and new spending, Republicans aim to cut back on Medicaid and food assistance for people below the poverty line.

Republicans argue they are trying to rightsize the safety net programs for the population they were initially designed to serve, mainly pregnant women, the disabled and children, and root out what they describe as waste, fraud and abuse.

The package includes new 80-hour-a-month work requirements for many adults receiving Medicaid and food stamps, including older people up to age 65. Parents of children 14 and older would have to meet the program’s work requirements.

There’s also a proposed new $35 co-payment that can be charged to patients using Medicaid services.

More than 71 million people rely on Medicaid, which expanded under Obama’s Affordable Care Act, and 40 million use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Most already work, according to analysts.

The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 11.8 million more Americans would become uninsured by 2034 if the bill became law and 3 million more would not qualify for food stamps, also known as SNAP benefits.

Republicans are looking to have states pick up some of the cost for SNAP benefits. Currently, the federal government funds all benefit costs. Under the bill, states beginning in 2028 will be required to contribute a set percentage of those costs if their payment error rate exceeds 6%. Payment errors include both underpayments and overpayments.

But the Senate bill temporarily delays the start date of that cost-sharing for states with the highest SNAP error rates. Alaska has the highest error rate in the nation at nearly 25%, according to Department of Agriculture data. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, had fought for the exception. She was a decisive vote in getting the bill through the Senate.The ‘big beautiful’ bill slashes clean energy tax credits

Republicans are proposing to dramatically roll back tax breaks designed to boost clean energy projects fueled by renewable sources such as energy and wind. The tax breaks were a central component of President Joe Biden’s 2022 landmark bill focused on addressing climate change and lowering health care costs.

Democratic Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden went so far as to call the GOP provisions a “death sentence for America’s wind and solar industries and an inevitable hike in utility bills.”

A tax break for people who buy new or used electric vehicles would expire on Sept. 30 of this year, instead of at the end of 2032 under current law.

Meanwhile, a tax credit for the production of critical materials will be expanded to include metallurgical coal used in steelmaking.The bill creates ‘Trump Accounts’ — and funds a national hero garden

A number of extra provisions reflect other GOP priorities.

The bill creates a new children’s savings program, called Trump Accounts, with a potential $1,000 deposit from the Treasury.

The Senate provided $40 million to establish Trump’s long-sought “National Garden of American Heroes.”

There’s a new excise tax on university endowments and a new tax on remittances, or transfers of money that people in the U.S. send abroad. The tax is equal to 1% of the transfer.

A $200 tax on gun silencers and short-barreled rifles and shotguns was eliminated.

One provision bars for one year Medicaid payments to family planning providers that provide abortions, namely Planned Parenthood.

Another section expands the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, a hard-fought provision from GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, for those impacted by nuclear development and testing.

Billions would go for the Artemis moon mission and for the exploration of Mars, while $88 million is earmarked for a pandemic response accountability committee.

Additionally, a provision would increase the nation’s debt limit, by $5 trillion, to allow continued borrowing to pay already accrued bills.State AI regulations cut from bill after a GOP uproar

The Senate overwhelmingly revolted against a proposal meant to deter states from regulating artificial intelligence. Republican governors across the country asked for the moratorium to be removed and the Senate voted to do so with a resounding 99-1 vote.

A provision was thrown in at the final hours that will provide $10 billion annually to rural hospitals for five years, or $50 billion in total. The Senate bill had originally provided $25 billion for the program, but that number was upped to win over holdout GOP senators and a coalition of House Republicans warning that reduced Medicaid provider taxes would hurt rural hospitals.

The amended bill also stripped out a new tax on wind and solar projects that use a certain percentage of components from China.Final price tag: GOP bill could add $3.3 trillion to deficit

Altogether, the Congressional Budget Office projects that the bill would increase federal deficits over the next 10 years by nearly $3.3 trillion from 2025 to 2034.

Or not, depending on how one does the math.

Senate Republicans are proposing a unique strategy of not counting the existing tax breaks as a new cost because those breaks are already “current policy.” Republican senators say the Senate Budget Committee chairman has the authority to set the baseline for the preferred approach.

Under the alternative Senate GOP view, the bill would reduce deficits by almost half a trillion dollars over the coming decade, the CBO said.",https://i0.wp.com/vernonreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/trump-johnson-sign.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&ssl=1,N,,2025-07-06 15:05:44.868487

Critics of President Donald Trump wasted no time blaming staffing cuts at the National Weather Service (NWS) for the widespread death and destruction caused by the floods in Texas, a reaction the White House called ""shameful and disgusting.""

At least 59 people, including 21 children, have been confirmed dead from the flash floods along the Guadalupe River that began Friday. Eleven children and one counselor remain missing from a girls' summer camp near the river, which flooded due to the remnants of Tropical Storm Barry. That storm made landfall over Mexico, but triggered massive unexpected thunderstorms over parts of Texas.

""It only took 9 days for Trump's cuts to the [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] to kill dozens of children in Texas when Tropical Storm Barry landed this week,"" Grant Stern, the executive editor of Occupy Democrats, wrote on X.

TEXAS FLOOD SURVIVORS SHARE HARROWING STORIES, SEARCH CONTINUES FOR THOSE STILL MISSING

""The people in Texas voted for government services controlled by Donald Trump and Greg Abbott,"" added Ron Filipkowski, former federal prosecutor and the editor-in-chief of MediasTouchNews. ""That is exactly what they (sic) getting.""

""What has happened to the girls at Camp Mystic is EXACTLY what one of the country's best meteorologists, John Morales, warned would happen,"" added Rachel Bitecofer, assistant director at Christopher Newport University's Wason Center for Public Policy. ""Trump's cuts to the NOAA & NWS have critically impacted storm prediction nationwide.""

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem held a press conference Saturday, and acknowledged some of the criticisms regarding the nation's flood notification systems, which included concerns that weather forecasts underestimated the amount of rain that ultimately fell.

Noem noted that the Trump administration is ""currently upgrading"" the nation's flood notification technology, which she described as ""ancient.""

""When the [weather] system came over the area, it stalled,"" Noem said during the press conference. ""It was much more water, much like [what] we experienced during [Hurricane] Harvey, with the same type of system that was unpredictable in the way that it reacted in the way that it stopped right here and dumped unprecedented amounts of rain that caused a flooding event like this.""

Tom Fahy, legislative director for the National Weather Service Employees Organization, told NBC News that weather forecasting offices were adequately staffed, and ""they issued timely forecasts and warnings leading up to the storm,"" but he added that unfilled leadership positions were ""clearly a concern.""

""The reason Trump defunded the National Weather Service leading to the deaths of all those girls in the Texas flood is because PROJECT 2025 THOUGHT WEATHER PREDICTION SCIENCE WAS TIED TO EVIDENCE OF CLIMATE CHANGE,"" musician Mikel Jollett wrote on X.

WHITE HOUSE INSISTS FEMA IS TAKING HURRICANE SEASON 'SERIOUSLY,' BLASTS 'SLOPPY' REPORTING

Isaiah Martin, a Democratic candidate for Texas's 18th Congressional District, called for an immediate congressional investigation into ""the Republican DOGE cuts to NOAA and the National Weather Service.""

""We saw the affects (sic) this weekend,"" Martin wrote on X. ""Trump defunded these agencies and we DEMAND answers. There MUST be *swift* accountability!""

Washington Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee did not directly blame Trump's approach to climate change for the deaths, but he suggested the president's efforts to peel back green energy funding are a contributing factor to increased catastrophic natural disasters, like this weekend's flood in Texas.

""It is hard to make the Texas flood tragedy worse, except to know that on the same day Trump signed a bill cratering solar and wind energy that is vital in the battle against the climate change making these torrential rains more frequent,"" Inslee wrote on X this weekend.

During an interview with CNN, Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, added that he didn't think it was helpful to have open leadership positions that, if filled, could ""help prevent these strategies.""

""I don’t think it’s helpful to have missing key personnel from the National Weather Service not in place to help prevent these tragedies,"" Castro said, adding ""we have to figure out in the future how we make sure that it doesn’t happen again.""

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson called it ""shameful and disgusting"" to see that in the wake of this tragedy people are politicizing what took place.

""It’s shameful and disgusting that in the wake of tragedy, the left’s first instinct is to lie and politicize a disaster to target their political opponents. False claims about the NWS have been repeatedly debunked by meteorologists, experts, and other public reporting,"" Jackson said. ""The NWS did their job, even issuing a flood watch more than 12 hours in advance.

Not just at the barber shop, but at every grocery store and around every kitchen table in this state.
Housing, the biggest barrier for working families and businesses trying to attract workers, gets lip service but no serious solutions.
It trades away long-term stability for short-term giveaways that weaken our hospitals, shortchange our kids and hit working families in the wallet.
And one day soon, those conversations in the barber shop, the local bar and around every kitchen table in New Hampshire will turn into votes at the polls.","Now that Gov. Kelly Ayotte’s ink is dry on the state budget, it’s clear where elected Republican priorities lie. It’s not with working families, community hospitals or our state’s economic future.

At every turn, this budget picks the pockets of Granite Staters who can least afford it, while showering handouts on those who are already well off. It’s a masterclass in upside-down priorities and nowhere is that clearer than in how it treats Medicaid, one of the most vital lifelines for our people and our hospitals.

During floor debate, Republican House Majority Leader Jason Osborne made it painfully clear just how out of touch Republicans are in understanding the impact of this budget. He stood up and said that “people at the barber shop or the grocery store aren’t asking about Medicaid reimbursement rates.” It was an elitist dismissal of the reality that working people do think about what keeps their local hospitals open, their health insurance active and the ways this budget harms them with health care costs that drain their paychecks.

The truth is, they’re thinking about it every single day because it hits them directly. When a hospital can’t afford to pay its nurses or keep a wing open because the state refuses to raise reimbursement rates, that means the emergency room wait time your family faces after an accident gets longer. When a mental health provider closes its doors, a child, a parent or a neighbor goes without care. And when nursing homes can’t keep up with real costs, families are forced to scramble to find a bed for an aging loved one or be faced with providing that care themselves.

It’s the same everyday people sitting in that barber chair who will feel the squeeze of this budget’s new taxes and punishing work requirements on Medicaid. These so-called “reforms” don’t save money, they just add paperwork and bureaucratic barriers that push people off coverage altogether.

The premiums are, plain and simple, an income tax on the Granite Staters who can least afford it. When family members are forced to skip a prescription, cancel their child’s doctor visit because they can’t pay or choose between paying for healthcare or groceries, you can bet that’s exactly what folks will be talking about. Not just at the barber shop, but at every grocery store and around every kitchen table in this state.

So, who benefits here?

Look no further than the “universal” school voucher scheme, a fiscal black hole already growing out of control. Just weeks after the governor signed the enabling bill into law, over 2,000 new applications have poured in from families whose kids were already in private schools. That means taxpayer money is being handed to private institutions that never received state funding before and still aren’t subject to taxpayer oversight.

And the kicker? This budget only funds 7,500 students, but the law allows for 10,000. We’re setting up local taxpayers to pick up the bill for the inevitable shortfall.

Meanwhile, our real economic engines go neglected. The University System, one of our greatest tools for keeping young people here and building the workforce we need, remains chronically underfunded. Housing, the biggest barrier for working families and businesses trying to attract workers, gets lip service but no serious solutions. And clean energy, an industry that should be powering jobs and lowering bills, takes a hit, too. This budget raids the Renewable Energy Fund and sets us up for the sunset of net metering in 2040, pushing solar developers and the good-paying jobs they bring out of state.

This budget is not fiscally conservative—it’s fiscally reckless. It trades away long-term stability for short-term giveaways that weaken our hospitals, shortchange our kids and hit working families in the wallet.

So, the next time the Republican Majority Leader Rep. Jason Osborne wants to act like working people don’t care about the Medicaid rates that keep their hospitals open, excessive costs for housing or the premiums and fees that drain their paychecks, he should spend a little more time in that barber shop. Because the folks in that chair are talking about it, and they know exactly who this budget works for and who it leaves behind.

And one day soon, those conversations in the barber shop, the local bar and around every kitchen table in New Hampshire will turn into votes at the polls.

New Hampshire deserves better than this upside-down budget, and Granite Staters are ready to stand up and demand it.

That comes as President Donald Trump signed into law his huge tax-and-spending bill, which eliminates key tax credits for the electric vehicle giant. Also over the weekend, a Tesla robotaxi brushed a parked car.

Musk announced Saturday on his social site X that he is forming the ""America Party"" after polling his followers. ""When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy,"" he wrote. ""Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.""

Musk says the America party will focus on ""just 2 or 3 Senate seats and 8 to 10 house districts.""

Musk doubling down on politics, after recently vowing to step back, is not what Tesla bulls want to hear, according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives.

""Very simply Musk diving deeper into politics and now trying to take on the Beltway establishment is exactly the opposite direction that Tesla investors/shareholders want him to take during this crucial period for the Tesla story,"" Ives wrote in a Sunday note. ""While the core Musk supporters will back Musk at every turn no matter what, there is broader sense of exhaustion from many Tesla investors that Musk keeps heading down the political track.""

Musk risks alienating Trump supporters after turning off Tesla's core customers in the U.S. and Europe with strong Trump support in 2024, his DOGE work earlier this year and various political statements over the past year or two.

Tesla Loses EV Tax Credits

Musk had reignited his feud with Trump in recent days over the president's budget, with the billionaire arguing that it will increase federal debt substantially. He's also signaled opposition to the legislation's repeal of green energy tax credits.

The newly signed legislation ends the $7,500 U.S. EV tax credit after Sept. 30. Tesla will likely see a big jump in U.S. sales in the third quarter, pulling forward demand before the tax credits expire. But after that U.S. sales will likely tumble.

Meanwhile, the Trump budget immediately scrapped highly profitable zero emission credits in the U.S. Other automakers would buy ZEV credits from Tesla to meet emission standards.

In the first quarter, Tesla would have had an operating loss without its ZEV credits. Tesla will still get emission credits in Europe and China, but its plunging European sales and sliding China demand will hit those revenue sources.

Meanwhile, Trump tariffs have sharply raised the cost of imported Chinese batteries for Tesla Energy.

Trump had campaigned on these issues, so these policies aren't really a surprise.

Futures Due With Trump Tariffs, Tesla Stock In Focus

Tesla Robotaxi

Most Tesla robotaxi rides in Austin, Texas, have gone smoothly. But, even with human supervision, there have been a few incidents, including a robotaxi recently brushing a stationary Toyota Camry while trying to park.

Tesla bulls hail the effort as vindication. But the EV giant likely will need to remove the safety monitors and significantly expand the number of robotaxis and where they operate before convincing many others.

Since the limited robotaxi launch in Austin, Texas, on June 22, Tesla stock is down 2.1%. Clearly a number of headlines beyond robotaxis are swirling around TSLA stock, including better-than-feared Q2 deliveries. But Uber Technologies (UBER), seen as an inverse play to Tesla's robotaxi efforts, has rallied 11.8% to 93.63 since June 22. Uber stock cleared an early entry on June 24 and just broke out Thursday from a flat base. Mobileye (MBLY) has shot up 29.6%, with the driver-assist systems maker clearing an early entry.

More broadly, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are up 5.2% and 5.9%, respectively, over that span, both hitting record highs.

Tesla Stock: What Next?

Tesla stock fell 2.6% to 315.35 last week, just between the 200-day and 50-day lines. Shares could be close to forging a new base.

But Musk's political move may have a big impact on Tesla stock. Shares rallied from late April to late May in part because Musk said he was backing away from politics and the Trump administration. TSLA tumbled on the Musk-Trump feud, rebounded as they defused tensions, then skidded again as Musk and Trump renewed their war of words.

The July 1 low of 293.21 is a short-term level to watch. So is the June 5 low of 273.21.

Investors will get an early read on TSLA stock around 8 p.m. ET, via trades on Robinhood, Charles Schwab and Interactive Brokers. Nasdaq early trading will begin around 5 a.m. ET on Monday. But Tesla is prone to big overnight moves that wane or reverse during regular trading.

(NASDAQ: ), a leading global provider of energy storage products and services, is navigating a complex landscape of regulatory challenges, market pressures, and strategic opportunities. With a market capitalization of $1.1 billion and a beta of 2.65, the stock has shown significant volatility, returning nearly 37% in the past week despite a challenging year-to-date decline of 47%. As the company positions itself in the rapidly evolving clean energy sector, investors and analysts are closely monitoring its performance and future prospects.

According to InvestingPro, FLNC currently holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, though it’s been rapidly burning through cash reserves. These insights are just 2 of over 15 exclusive ProTips available to subscribers, helping investors make more informed decisions about this volatile clean energy stock.

Market Position and Recent Performance

Fluence Energy has established itself as a significant player in the energy storage market, with a strong presence in North America and expanding operations in EMEA and APAC regions. The company’s market capitalization stood at approximately $1.27 billion as of July 2025, reflecting its substantial footprint in the industry.

However, recent financial results have been mixed. The company reported disappointing results for the first quarter of 2025, leading to short-term weakness in the stock. Analysts have noted that the fiscal year 2025 is expected to be heavily backweighted, with a 20/80 split between first half and second half revenues. This uneven distribution has contributed to investor uncertainty regarding revenue outlooks.

Despite these challenges, Fluence Energy maintains a solid position in the market. The company benefits from a first-mover advantage in domestic sourcing, which could potentially lead to pricing and margin premiums. Additionally, the secular increase in demand for battery storage, driven by declining prices and the need for grid reliability, provides a favorable backdrop for Fluence’s operations.

Regulatory Environment and Tariff Impact

The regulatory landscape has become increasingly complex for Fluence Energy, with several factors influencing the company’s operations and financial outlook. Recent financial data from InvestingPro shows the company struggling with weak gross profit margins of 13.07% and negative EBITDA of -$11.63 million in the last twelve months. These challenges underscore the importance of regulatory developments for the company’s future profitability. One of the most significant developments has been the initiation of Anti-Dumping/Countervailing Duty (AD/CVD) investigations on anode grade graphite material imported from China by the U.S. Department of Commerce. The complaint alleges dumping margins ranging from 823% to 916%, which could have substantial implications for Fluence’s supply chain and cost structure.

Analysts estimate that the cost of goods sold (COGS) for energy storage system (ESS) battery systems is only about 3% of the graphite cost. This suggests that every 25% tariff could potentially create a 60 basis point headwind to Fluence’s margins. However, the company may have opportunities to pass on or share these costs to help offset and mitigate the margin impact.

The tariff situation remains fluid, with potential changes in policy under different administrations adding to the uncertainty. Some analysts speculate that increased tariffs on Chinese cells could make Fluence’s domestically produced cells more cost-competitive, potentially benefiting the company in the long run.

Strategic Initiatives and Future Outlook

In response to the challenging regulatory environment and market pressures, Fluence Energy has undertaken several strategic initiatives to strengthen its competitive position. One of the most notable moves has been the company’s focus on securing domestic U.S. cell production for energy storage. This strategy anticipates potential policy changes that could favor domestically produced components.

To support these initiatives, Fluence recently raised approximately $400 million through convertible securities, bolstering its financial position. This capital infusion provides the company with a buffer against market uncertainty and supports its investments in domestic manufacturing capabilities.

The company’s strategic pivot towards U.S.-made cells could prove advantageous, particularly if stricter domestic content requirements are implemented for tax credits related to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Analysts view this bet on domestic production as a smart move that could lead to significant gains in U.S. market share.

Financial Analysis and Projections

Fluence Energy’s financial projections reflect both the challenges and opportunities facing the company. Earnings per share (EPS) estimates for the fiscal year 2025 range from $0.38 to $0.70, with projections for fiscal year 2026 ranging from $0.93 to $1.66. These estimates suggest expectations of significant profitability improvements over the coming years.

However, some analysts have revised their EBITDA projections downward, showing a reduction of 20-30% through fiscal year 2028 due to anticipated margin compression. This compression is largely attributed to ongoing price deflation in the energy storage systems market, driven by competitive pressures from Chinese suppliers.

Revenue projections remain robust, with estimates for fiscal year 2025 ranging from $2.7 billion to $4.1 billion, and fiscal year 2026 projections reaching as high as $5.2 billion. Current revenue stands at $2.33 billion, with InvestingPro’s Fair Value analysis suggesting the stock is slightly undervalued at current levels. These figures underscore the expected growth in the energy storage market, despite the competitive and regulatory challenges.

Bear Case

How might ongoing tariff uncertainties impact FLNC’s competitiveness?

The complex tariff environment poses a significant risk to Fluence Energy’s operations and financial performance. The potential implementation of high tariffs on Chinese imports could disrupt the company’s supply chain and increase costs. While Fluence has been proactive in securing domestic production capabilities, the transition period could be challenging and potentially costly.

If tariffs are implemented unevenly or unpredictably, it could create a volatile pricing environment where Fluence struggles to maintain consistent margins. Competitors with more diversified supply chains or those less reliant on Chinese components might gain an advantage, potentially eroding Fluence’s market share.

Moreover, if the tariffs lead to retaliatory measures from China or other countries, it could impact Fluence’s international operations and growth prospects in key markets like EMEA and APAC. This geopolitical uncertainty adds another layer of complexity to the company’s strategic planning and risk management.

What risks does FLNC face from increasing competition in the energy storage market?

As the energy storage market continues to grow rapidly, Fluence Energy faces intensifying competition from both established players and new entrants. Chinese suppliers, in particular, have been exerting significant pricing pressure, leading to ongoing price deflation in the energy storage systems market.

This competitive landscape poses several risks for Fluence. First, the company may struggle to maintain its pricing power, potentially leading to margin erosion even as revenues grow. Second, competitors may innovate more quickly or offer more attractive product features, challenging Fluence’s technological edge.

Additionally, as more companies enter the market, there’s a risk of commoditization in certain segments of the energy storage industry. This could make it harder for Fluence to differentiate its offerings and maintain premium pricing, further pressuring margins and profitability.

Bull Case

How could FLNC benefit from stricter domestic content requirements?

Stricter domestic content requirements, particularly those related to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), could significantly benefit Fluence Energy. The company’s strategic decision to invest in domestic U.S. cell production positions it well to capitalize on such policy changes.

If new regulations favor domestically produced components, Fluence could see increased demand for its products as customers seek to qualify for tax credits and other incentives. This could lead to a larger market share in the U.S. and potentially higher margins as the company’s domestic production becomes more cost-competitive relative to imported alternatives.

Furthermore, stricter domestic content rules could create barriers to entry for foreign competitors, particularly those heavily reliant on Chinese manufacturing. This could give Fluence a significant advantage in the U.S. market, allowing it to solidify its position as a leading provider of energy storage solutions.

What potential does FLNC have for margin improvement through vertical integration?

Fluence Energy’s investments in domestic production capabilities open up opportunities for vertical integration, which could lead to significant margin improvements. By controlling more of its supply chain, the company can potentially reduce costs, improve quality control, and increase operational efficiency.

Vertical integration could allow Fluence to better manage inventory, reduce lead times, and respond more quickly to market demands. This increased agility could be particularly valuable in a rapidly evolving industry like energy storage.

Moreover, by developing proprietary technologies and manufacturing processes, Fluence could create unique value propositions that differentiate its products from competitors. This could lead to premium pricing and higher margins, especially if the company can demonstrate superior performance or reliability.

As Fluence gains more experience with its vertically integrated operations, it may also identify new opportunities for innovation and cost reduction, further enhancing its competitive position and financial performance.

“Any assertion to the contrary is false.” The California-China Climate Institute Former California Gov.","China-linked entities have their fingerprints on climate lobbying and lawsuits in the U.S., causing alarm among some lawmakers and watchdog organizations.

“I don’t know the intentions. But whatever the intentions, policy after policy demonstrably strengthens China and weakens the United States,” Scott Walter, president of the investigative think tank Capital Research Center, told The Daily Signal of the green policies pushed by environmental groups that work with or receive funding from China.

“The most obvious is forcing green energy and subsidies [for green energy]. China overwhelmingly procures the outputs,” Walter continued. “We are literally subsidizing China’s industry. Americans don’t want electric vehicles and electric stove mandates. And who makes most of the parts for these electric appliances? It’s not the U.S. It’s China.”

Though China is one of the world’s biggest polluters, it is also the largest supplier of green energy products. China supplies 78% of the world’s solar cells, 80% of the world’s lithium-ion battery chemicals, and 73% of the world’s finished battery cells, according to Just Facts, a research organization.

But U.S.-based environmental organizations contend their partnerships with these entities make sense because global climate change problems can’t be addressed without working with organizations in China because of the impact of its massive carbon emissions on the rest of the world. Further, the groups stress that China-linked dollars used to fund these organizations are not used to affect U.S. policy.

“We work in China for one reason: There’s not a single global environmental problem that the world can confront unless China is part of the fix,” Natural Resources Defense Council spokesperson Josh Mogerman told The Daily Signal in a statement.

On June 25, a Senate subcommittee held a hearing titled “Enter the Dragon—China and the Left’s Lawfare Against American Energy Dominance.” Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach, a Republican, was a witness at the hearing.

In an interview with The Daily Signal, Kobach noted that an organization called the Chinese-American Planning Council lobbied the state of New York to pass the Climate Change Superfund Act to impose retroactive fines on fossil fuel producers. This led to 22 states—including Kansas—to sue New York state over the act and its fines. Plaintiffs argue the superfund would raise energy prices nationally.

“China’s involvement was crystal clear in lobbying for the superfund law in New York,” Kobach told The Daily Signal. “We don’t have a clear picture of who is funding the county and local lawsuits against fossil fuel companies. But China has such a huge interest, it stands to reason they are probably also engaged in state and local litigation.”

A spokesperson for the New York-based Chinese-American Planning Council, which was established in 1965, did not respond to phone and email inquiries for this story this week or last week. The group’s website shows it has advocated for the superfund law.

Two bills in Congress would require more transparency regarding who is paying for the lawsuits.

Rep. Ben Cline, R-Va., introduced the Protecting Our Courts From Foreign Manipulation Act. Cline’s bill would require the Justice Department’s National Security Division to report on foreign funding in federal litigation. The legislation would also require any foreign person or entity to disclose if it is a third-party funder of a civil lawsuit in federal court.

“In recent years, foreign adversaries like the Chinese Communist Party have grown bolder in their efforts to infiltrate and manipulate America’s legal system,” Cline told The Daily Signal in a statement. “Through third-party litigation funding, these actors aim to influence legal outcomes in ways that serve their political interests and threaten our national security.”

Cline added, “We must not allow the CCP or any foreign entity to undermine our legal institutions or the rule of law in the United States.”

A bipartisan version of the Cline bill was introduced in the Senate in 2023.

Meanwhile, Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., was the lead sponsor earlier this year of the Litigation Transparency Act of 2025, which would require the disclosure of those parties getting payments in civil lawsuits and the disclosure of the financing agreement between investors in and parties to these civil actions.

Climate Collaboration Backed by China

A big funder of U.S. climate groups has been the Energy Foundation China, based in San Francisco.

The foundation’s president and CEO is Ji Zou, a former deputy director general of China’s National Center for Climate Change Strategy and International Cooperation, which is part of the Chinese government’s National Development and Reform Commission, according to the organization.

Zou was also a member of the Chinese climate negotiation team leading up to the Paris Agreement, a multilateral climate deal which the Obama administration entered with China in an attempt to reduce carbon emissions.

David Vance Wagner is the Energy Foundation China vice president for strategic development. He was previously a China counsellor in the Office of the Special Envoy for Climate Change at the State Department, and helped lead U.S.-China collaboration on climate, according to the Energy Foundation China.

“Energy Foundation China (EFC) is an independent grantmaking charitable organization that provides funding for research and capacity building related to climate change and China,” Wagner told Fox News last month amid criticism of the organization. He added, “All grants we make support projects related to climate change and China, and are in no way related to influencing U.S. energy policy. EFC does not accept funding from any government or political party.”

Wagner went on to say: “Neither the Chinese government nor the CCP fund, direct, or control EFC or our grant-making decisions. We are compliant with all U.S. and Chinese laws and regulations and do not lobby or support electoral activities in any country.”

The Energy Foundation China did not respond to multiple email inquiries for this story last week and this week. The group’s website says over the past 25 years, it funded more than 4,000 projects, with total of more than $500 million.

“Our work is currently focused on China given the scale of its energy sector and its role in global emissions,” the website says. It adds, “Despite geopolitical tensions, meaningful engagement in China on climate change, emissions reductions, and supporting the clean energy transition is in everyone’s interests.”

The coordinated campaign of pushing so-called green policies and green litigation in the United States is the strategic alliance of “leftist billionaires, radical environmental organizations, and the Chinese Communist Party,” Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said at the hearing last week of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Federal Courts, Oversight, Agency Action, and Federal Rights.

“One of the primary vehicles for this alliance is Energy Foundation China, which has funneled upwards of $12 million to U.S.-based climate advocacy groups,” Cruz said. “This money isn’t going to tree-planting campaigns or to science fairs. It’s flowing directly to aggressive litigation outfits like the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Rocky Mountain Institute, and the World Resources Institute—organizations that routinely file lawsuits trying to block [oil and gas] pipelines.”

The World Resources Institute denied any role in litigation.

“World Resources Institute is a nonpartisan nonprofit organization that produces data-driven research. WRI does not participate in litigation or direct legal actions by others,” World Resources Institute spokesperson Allison Cinnamond told The Daily Signal.

In 2017, the Rocky Mountain Institute, an environmental think tank, issued a report along with the Chinese government’s National Development and Reform Commission and other organizations. According to the report, the goal was to reach “a common factbase for how China could use energy efficiency and renewable energy to meet the growing demand of its population for a clean, low-carbon, efficient, safe, reliable, and cost-effective modern energy system.”

The RMI does not engage in litigation, a spokesperson noted. Further, all of the Energy Foundation China funding that it has received has been focused on tackling pollution in China, not shaping U.S. policy, the spokesperson said.

“All of RMI’s work supported by Energy Foundation China, which is a U.S.-based charitable organization, is focused squarely on the energy transition inside of China,” Rocky Mountain Institute spokesperson Dina Cappiello told The Daily Signal. “It is factually inaccurate to state or imply that any of these funds were related to our U.S.-based work.”

The Rocky Mountain Institute works in China for a straightforward reason, she said. “RMI works in China because it is the world’s single largest source of energy demand and the world’s largest emitter of heat-trapping pollution, accounting for roughly a third of each.”

“Solving energy resource issues cannot happen without engaging China, nor can solutions solely depend on China,” Capiello continued. “RMI has shared its independent research and analysis with governments all over the world, including the U.S., China, India, and many others; diverse policymakers; corporations; and researchers and fellow nongovernmental entities, in order to accelerate the adoption of market-based solutions for efficient, affordable, resilient, and clean energy.”

The Natural Resources Defense Council also denies using China-linked resources to shape U.S. policy.

“When developing our institutional positions—in the United States, India, China, or anywhere else in the world—we rely on our U.S.-based senior leadership and board of independent trustees, and no one else. We do the bidding of no government, in this country or any other,” said Mogerman, the spokesperson for the Natural Resources Defense Council.

“NRDC does not take money from the Chinese government. NRDC used grant funding from the Energy Foundation China exclusively for work to help China cut pollution, not for U.S. advocacy or litigation,” Mogerman said. “Any assertion to the contrary is false.”

The California-China Climate Institute

Former California Gov. Jerry Brown launched the Californian China-Climate Institute at the University of California, Berkeley in 2019. The California-based institute partners with the Institute of Climate Change and Sustainable Development at China’s Tsinghua University, according to the Capital Research Center. That is the same Chinese university where hackers probed U.S. companies and government offices for espionage purposes in 2018, Reuters reported.

“The [California-China Climate Institute] was established to study and recommend actions to reverse catastrophic global warming, which can only be done if China—the world’s largest climate polluter—does its part,” an institute spokesperson told The Daily Signal in a statement.

The California institute is affiliated with both the University of California Berkeley School of Law and the Rausser College of Natural Resources.

The spokesperson for the institute dismissed testimony from the Senate hearing about Chinese money backing U.S. environmental groups, and said the California-China Climate Institute “does not lobby or litigate.”",https://www.dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/250702_China-Enviros-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-07-06 12:20:06.881567

Faster charging and dependable power systems affect everything from emergency response to aviation.","Ampcera didn't just put out another new product. As CEO Sumin Zhu, Ph.D, put it, ""It's a shift."" One that may change how devices like your phone and electric car hold their charge.

Interesting Engineering reports that this U.S.-based company has begun commercial shipments of its nano-sulfide solid electrolyte powders. This may sound like a new energy sports drink, and it sort of is — but for your devices.

These powders don't splash around like battery liquid; they allow energy to flow through solids. In other words, the battery can run cooler, charge faster, and last a lot longer.

""A pivotal commercial milestone,"" Zhu said, per Interesting Engineering.

Ampcera itself reassured that the new materials offer ""enhanced safety with 50% more energy compared to current lithium-ion batteries.""

This isn't lab theory. Orders are in. Over 200 customers are already using the new materials in tests.

Most solid-state batteries still rely on liquids that can overheat or break down.

This new material changes that. According to Interesting Engineering, Ampcera claims that its solid-state cells achieve an energy density of 400 Wh/kg and retain 80% of their capacity after fast charging. That's like charging your phone before dinner and still having battery left the next week.

Fewer failures also mean fewer rare materials wasted. That cuts down on mining and reduces air and water pollution from material processing.

""Enhanced safety with 50% more energy"" isn't just a promise — it's already in use. A more stable battery design reduces the likelihood of thermal runaway — the kind of failure that leads to overheating or worse. For people in dense cities or sensitive environments, that reliability could mean fewer safety issues, lower insurance costs, and peace of mind.

It could also reshape how we power future tech. Think grid storage, electric delivery trucks, and even military-grade gear. Faster charging and dependable power systems affect everything from emergency response to aviation.

If supply chains cooperate, these next-gen batteries could start showing up within two years. Not splashy, but it's the kind of upgrade, along with smart green tech like solar panels, that quietly makes things safer, faster, and cleaner to use.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/EV-charging-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-06 14:07:57.907156

In 2023, the climate tech start-up Seabound partnered with Lomarlabs, a subsidiary of UK-based shipowner Lomar Shipping, to trial a new technology that it hoped would capture carbon emissions to help decarbonise its shipping activities.
They developed a prototype that helped them raise $4 million in funding from investors who were looking for a way to decarbonise shipping.
During pilot projects, Seabound was able to improve the rate of emissions capture to 78 percent carbon capture efficiency and over 90 percent sulphur capture.
This means shipping companies can manage the level of carbon capture during a ship’s journey by purchasing and using more or fewer quicklime containers.","The race is on to decarbonise shipping, a hard-to-abate industry in which it is extremely difficult to cut emissions. Over 50,000 cargo ships are at sea at any moment, and these ships produce around 3 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, which is even more than aviation, showing the dire need to clean up the industry. The long-term focus is on developing sustainable fuels, hydrogen fuel cells, or batteries big enough to power these giant vessels. However, one company believes it may have a short-term solution for reducing emissions as it rolls out its carbon-capture technology on board ships.

In 2023, the climate tech start-up Seabound partnered with Lomarlabs, a subsidiary of UK-based shipowner Lomar Shipping, to trial a new technology that it hoped would capture carbon emissions to help decarbonise its shipping activities. The pilot project was part of the U.K. Department for Transport’s 2022 Clean Maritime Demonstration Competition Round 3, which allocated $82 million to 19 flagship projects.

Seabound’s compact carbon capture device can be retrofitted into a ship’s engine exhaust at the funnel, giving it the potential to be used on a wide range of preexisting vessels. The technology takes up little space on board but can make a big difference. Carbon dioxide, which comes from the diesel that is burnt to power the vessel, chemically reacts with little calcium oxide (quicklime) pebbles, which are used to convert the CO2 into calcium carbonate, or limestone, to lock it in and stop it being released into the atmosphere. The pebbles can be stored easily on the ship until it returns to port, where the limestone is offloaded to be sold in its pure form or to be reseparated into quicklime and CO2 for the quicklime to be reused on other vessels.

Co-founders Alisha Fredriksson and Roujia Wen took the idea from the quicklime-based carbon-capture technology often used at industrial plants. They developed a prototype that helped them raise $4 million in funding from investors who were looking for a way to decarbonise shipping.

During pilot projects, Seabound was able to improve the rate of emissions capture to 78 percent carbon capture efficiency and over 90 percent sulphur capture. The team hoped to improve this to up to 95 percent emission capture. Seabound’s prototype captured around one tonne of carbon dioxide emissions a day during the test.

In 2025, the project is still advancing. Since the initial tests, Seabound has advanced its prototypes and tested its technology in Turkish shipyards, on the deck of a 3,200-container ship, and a three-week trip down the Suez Canal. The company’s new prototype is being developed to the dimensions of a standard 20-foot shipping container, meaning that it will be able to slot in with the cargo on deck.

Several containers with quicklime will be stacked alongside regular cargo so that the ship can incrementally increase carbon capture as the journey progresses, as containers holding limestone can be traded out for containers of fresh quicklime. This means shipping companies can manage the level of carbon capture during a ship’s journey by purchasing and using more or fewer quicklime containers.

To make the project even cleaner, companies are working on producing quicklime using kilns heated with renewable energy or incorporating carbon capture technology into manufacturing operations. Seabound hopes to source this green quicklime for future projects to make its operations more sustainable.

However, some environmental groups are concerned that incorporating carbon capture technology into vessels could deter the maritime sector from investing in long-term decarbonisation options. Blánaid Sheeran at Opportunity Green said, “The potential for short-term use of carbon-capture retrofits on existing vessels should not become a justification to extend the lifespan of fossil fuels or delay the shift to truly sustainable alternatives.”

However, Fredriksson and Wen believe that their technology can be used in the mid-term, while governments increase shipping regulations and invest in long-term decarbonisation technologies. As stricter regulations on maritime emissions are introduced, the founders plan to roll out more containers to help decarbonise.

The next challenge for Seabourne is to scale up operations. Each of the company’s quicklime units is priced at tens of thousands of pounds. Nevertheless, Fredriksson and Wen believe the units are cost-effective, and they are seeing increasing interest from shipping companies that are looking to decarbonise. The founders hope their technology will eventually be used on thousands of ships all over the world.

While innovative carbon capture technology cannot be used as a preventative method for carbon emissions, it may be useful in helping prevent large quantities of CO2 from being released into the atmosphere as a mid-term solution. Meanwhile, governments must introduce stricter regulations on the maritime sector and shipping companies should invest in research and development into sustainable fuels and other long-term solutions.

With a focus on housing, transport, and green innovation, the region is emerging as a compelling investment destination. Here's why investors should take note.

Infrastructure Boom: Housing and Transport as Growth Catalysts

The cornerstone of Barrow's revival is its ambitious infrastructure overhaul. Over 12,000 new homes—including 800 units in the Marina Village mixed-use development—will cater to a growing population and attract young professionals. Higher-density housing in the town center aims to reverse depopulation trends, while upgrades to the A590/A595 road network and Furness rail line will boost connectivity for both residents and freight logistics.

BAE Systems, Barrow's anchor employer with over 14,500 jobs, exemplifies the region's strategic importance to UK defense. Its stock's resilience reflects the sector's stability, but the real opportunity lies in the plan's diversification beyond traditional industries.

Green Energy: A Strategic Edge for Investors

Barrow's pivot to clean energy is its most compelling investment angle. The GRAMM consortium's proposed Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) project—targeting up to 850 new jobs by 2035—aligns with UK net-zero goals. Meanwhile, offshore wind and carbon capture projects will anchor a green economy.

The region's existing maritime expertise positions it to dominate emerging sectors like offshore wind installation and hydrogen production. Investors should monitor companies like Ørsted (ORSTED.C), pioneers in offshore wind, and local firms bidding for Barrow's green contracts.

Job Creation: A Diversified Pipeline

The plan's success hinges on its 360-degree job strategy:

- Defense: 14,500+ existing roles, with submarine programs securing long-term employment.

- Clean Energy: 850+ jobs from SAF alone, plus roles in wind and carbon capture.

- Education: A new University of Cumbria campus (2025) offering engineering and nursing degrees will train a locally rooted workforce.

- Logistics: Improved transport networks will attract warehousing and distribution hubs.

By 2035, Barrow aims to reduce economic inactivity below the national average, with workforce qualifications (RQF 4+) rising significantly.

Public-Private Synergy: A Blueprint for Success

The Team Barrow partnership—uniting government, BAE Systems, and local authorities—ensures coordinated investment. Key collaborations include:

- The £970k Barrow Transformation Fund, developing outline plans for mixed-use town center projects.

- The Brilliant Futures Fund (£5M) and Social Impact Fund (£650k+ distributed), boosting education and community resilience.

These partnerships reduce risk for private investors, as public funding de-risks early-stage projects like the SAF plant or rail upgrades.

Demographic Upside: A Growing Population, Rising Demand

With 12,000 new homes, Barrow's population is set to expand by ~20% over a decade. This growth will fuel demand for retail, healthcare, and leisure—sectors ripe for investment. The town center's planned cultural amenities (e.g., theaters, event spaces) will further attract visitors and talent.

Investment Playbook: How to Capitalize

Real Estate: Back developers building Marina Village or town-center mixed-use projects. Look for firms with strong local ties.

Green Energy: Invest in companies bidding for Barrow's renewable projects or partnering with GRAMM.

Logistics: Target firms benefiting from A590/A595 upgrades or Furness rail efficiency gains.

Education & Skills: Support the University of Cumbria's Innovation Hub or apprenticeship programs aligned with local industry needs.

Final Take: A Decade of Opportunity

Barrow's 10-year plan is not just about infrastructure—it's a strategic rebalancing of the UK economy. By 2035, the region could rival Scotland's renewables hubs or the Thames Estuary's logistics corridors. Early investors in Barrow's housing, green energy, and logistics sectors stand to benefit from a virtuous cycle of job growth, rising property values, and diversified tax revenues.

Throughout the conference, a common theme emerged: progress is still possible, but only with shared responsibility across public and private sectors.
The conference concluded with a unified call to scale up ambition, reduce policy fragmentation and strengthen cross-border cooperation.","The International Finance Forum (IFF), in partnership with the Task Force on Carbon Pricing in Europe and the American Institute for Governance & Sustainable Development, have co-hosted a high-level conference under the theme of “Overcoming New Hurdles in Firms’ Fight Against Global Warming.” The event brought together leading voices from international organizations, government and industry to discuss emerging challenges and solutions in the global climate agenda.

Against the backdrop of mounting geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty, the conference emphasized the need for renewed commitment and bold policy actions to preserve momentum in combating climate change. While the climate agenda has experienced setbacks in recent years, participants agreed that businesses are continuing to press forward, translating climate ambition into action, investment and innovation.

Edmond Alphandéry, Chairman of the Task Force on Carbon Pricing in Europe, warned of growing inertia in climate policymaking, commenting: “We need to get the climate control race back on track. Political and financial forces are slowing us down, and this is deeply concerning. The temperature trends globally are alarming, and the consequences of inaction are irreversible.”

Zhu Xian, IFF Executive VP and former VP of the World Bank, echoed those concerns: “After several years of steady progress in advancing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, a series of obstacles now threatens to halt, and even reverse, our gains. Yet, across the world, companies remain committed to their duty to protect our planet for future generations.”

Durwood Zaelke, Founder and President of the Institute for Governance & Sustainable Development, stressed the importance of both science and communication in addressing the climate emergency, adding: “The climate crisis is defined by three factors: temperature, time and tipping points. We are already at 1.5°C of warming, and the path we are on could exceed 2°C within a decade. Irreversible tipping points like the collapse of Atlantic ocean currents demand immediate, coordinated solutions.”

The high-level conference explored how firms are scaling up renewable energy projects amid infrastructure and policy challenges.

Marta Martinez Sanchez, Head of Analysis and Special Projects at Iberdrola, highlighted that renewables are gaining ground, but deployment is constrained: “To accelerate clean energy at scale, we need stronger policy support for infrastructure rollout and demand stimulation. Supply alone isn’t enough. We need demand-side incentives and industrial value chains to support solar, wind and battery manufacturing.”

Dr. Xie Tian, GM of LONGi’s Strategic Management Centre, pointed out that LONGi provides global climate mitigation solutions through technological innovation and intelligent green manufacturing. In terms of technological innovation, verified by Germany’s Hamelin Institute for Solar Energy (ISFH), the company’s independently developed Hybrid Interdigitated-Back-Contact (HIBC) crystalline silicon solar cell has achieved a conversion efficiency of 27.81% through calibration experiments, setting a new world record. In addition, the conversion efficiency of a two-terminal crystalline silicon-perovskite tandem solar cell developed by the company has been certified by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in the United States to have reached 34.85%, once again breaking the world record.

Dr. Xie also informed attendees that LONGi’s Jiaxing base has achieved dual benchmark certification as both a “Lighthouse” and “Zero-Carbon” factory. This accomplishment has resulted in a 28% reduction in manufacturing costs, 84% shorter production lead times and 24.6% lower energy consumption per unit. Dr. Xie emphasized that, as the PV industry’s first dual-certified factory, the Jiaxing base underlines the company’s leadership in driving digital and green transformation across the sector. By integrating smart technologies into advanced PV manufacturing, LONGi pursues green production to further achieve carbon neutrality. The company has also implemented a data platform for ESG disclosure management, enabling verification and analysis of sustainability metrics.

Paul Frankel, Head of the Renewable Energy Department at the International Energy Agency (IEA), revealed at the meeting that the global installed capacity of renewable energy will increase by 700 gigawatts in 2024, with China making a significant contribution and ranking first in the world in terms of photovoltaic installed capacity. The IEA predicts that global installed capacity of renewable energy will increase by over 5500 gigawatts between 2024 and 2030, with solar photovoltaics becoming the main force due to cost reduction and accelerated approval.

The study examines the potential impact of introducing zonal pricing, a system that adjusts electricity rates based on local demand and supply.
According to the analysis, this approach could reduce industrial electricity costs in the North East of England by nearly £6 million.
FTI’s findings add weight to ongoing calls for structural reforms in how industrial energy is priced.
“We’ve now got clear evidence that zonal pricing will cut these costs at the source without pushing the burden onto households.","Electricity costs for vehicle manufacturers in the UK could be significantly reduced without increasing the financial burden on households or small businesses. That’s the key finding from a new report by FTI Consulting, commissioned by Octopus Energy.

The study examines the potential impact of introducing zonal pricing, a system that adjusts electricity rates based on local demand and supply. According to the analysis, this approach could reduce industrial electricity costs in the North East of England by nearly £6 million.

This would be a much-needed boost for the UK’s vehicle manufacturing industry, which currently faces some of the highest energy prices in the world. FTI’s findings add weight to ongoing calls for structural reforms in how industrial energy is priced.

The manufacturing group Make UK has recently underscored the pressure that high energy costs are placing on businesses. While the government’s existing energy subsidy has been beneficial to approximately 370 energy-intensive firms, the flip side is that it adds a substantial charge to everyone else’s energy bills. This levy now adds roughly £410 million a year to consumer costs, a figure projected to more than double by the 2030s.

Zonal pricing could change that. By making the electricity system more efficient, the model could save non-subsidised manufacturers an average of £12 to £16 per megawatt-hour by 2030. In some areas, like the North of Scotland, savings could reach as high as £29 per megawatt-hour.

Octopus Energy is now urging the government to rethink how energy is priced, advocating for a model that cuts costs at the root rather than passing them down to consumers.

The momentum behind the idea is growing. The House of Lords Industry and Regulators Committee has joined a growing list of supporters that includes Ofgem, NESO, Citizens Advice, and other leading voices in the energy sector.

Greg Jackson, CEO and Founder of Octopus Energy Group, said:

Britain’s manufacturers are being crushed by electricity costs, among the highest in the world.

“We’ve now got clear evidence that zonal pricing will cut these costs at the source without pushing the burden onto households.

“Instead of robbing Peter to pay Paul, zonal pricing can slash bills for heavy industry and households whilst accelerating our path to clean energy.”

Jason Mann, Senior Managing Director at FTI Consulting, said:

“Our work for Octopus on zonal pricing (and previously for Ofgem) shows that zonal pricing could materially benefit all British consumers. This is true for households as well as larger industrial consumers.

“Our most recent study indicates that with minor changes to the special arrangements that currently apply, all of the country’s very largest manufacturing plants could also benefit from lower electricity prices were zonal pricing to be implemented.”

Matthew Evans, Chief Operations Officer, techUK, said:

“The UK’s digital economy cannot remain globally competitive while data centres – core to AI, cloud computing, and high-performance technologies – face some of the highest industrial energy costs in the world.

Unlike other energy-intensive sectors, data centres bear 100% of network, policy, and balancing charges despite leading in renewable energy investment.

“If we want Britain to be a tech maker, not just a tech taker, we need urgent reform in energy pricing structures, including zonal pricing, that recognise the strategic value of digital infrastructure and remove cost-based barriers to growth.”","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/becc64_002d951e9d1e40238057aba8a96d79fb~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_815,h_503,al_c,lg_1,q_85/becc64_002d951e9d1e40238057aba8a96d79fb~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-07-06 12:19:13.876077

Hyundai slashes lease prices for the Ioniq 6 to attract EV buyers.

EV sales are witnessing a decline industry-wide, with a 6.2% drop recorded in June.

The expiration of federal tax credits could further impact demand for EVs.

Hyundai's Strategic Move: Lowering Lease Prices

Hyundai Motor Company (HYMTF) is making a bold attempt to boost its electric vehicle (EV) market share by slashing the monthly lease price of its Ioniq 6 model to just $169. This aggressive pricing strategy aims to entice consumers who are on the fence about transitioning from traditional gasoline vehicles to electric ones.

Industry-Wide Decline in EV Sales

Despite Hyundai's efforts, the EV market is facing challenges. Sales across the industry have seen a notable decline, with a significant 6.2% drop reported in June. This trend indicates a growing consumer reluctance to embrace electric vehicles, which could be attributed to several market dynamics.

The Impact of Federal Tax Credits

Adding to these challenges, the imminent expiration of federal tax credits is expected to further dampen demand for electric vehicles. These credits have played a crucial role in making EVs more affordable for consumers, and their expiration could create additional hurdles for the EV market's growth.",https://static.gurufocus.com/logos/0C00000NWR.png?20,N,,2025-07-06 15:04:56.506809

Large Electric SUV For America Axed It's important to note that the report claims that only the large electric SUV has been canceled.
Toyota recently pulled a similar move for its upcoming electric SUV, delaying its American-built SUVs and reallocating its upcoming production due to the popularity of the Grand Highlander.","Honda is one of those automakers that has slowed down their EV development due to weakening demand. Its 10-year plan, which shows a push for hybrids, was revealed earlier this year. It also confirmed a delay to three upcoming EVs based on the 0 Series SUV concept, launching between 2027 and 2028. Now, that plan has been scrapped for one of those three electric SUVs, according to a fresh report from Tokyo.

The information came from Nikkei Asia, which cites the continued weakening demand for EVs in the US as the main reason for the cancelation. In particular, the Japanese marque has projected a further delay in EV adoption in America due to the recently passed ""Big, Beautiful Bill,"" which will remove the $7,500 federal tax credit on qualified brand-new EVs after September 30, 2025.

Large Electric SUV For America Axed

It's important to note that the report claims that only the large electric SUV has been canceled. The battery-powered midsize SUV and sedan, which were both previewed by the 0 Series Concepts, are still happening, with the low-slung model arriving first in 2026. Honda has also started showing the midsize 0 Series SUV to the public during the Japanese Grand Prix in April.

The large SUV was supposed to be primed for the American market, where 60% of the automaker's sales are for high-riding models. However, due to the higher cost of development, the declining demand posed uncertainty in terms of sales. Honda has previously announced a reduction in its EV-related investments through the end of the decade, from 10 trillion yen ($69 billion) to 7 trillion yen ($48 billion).

Investing More In Hybrids For More Revenue

Unsurprisingly, the automaker will now allocate its resources to pushing for the development of hybrids. Looking back at its 10-year plan, the automaker is almost confirmed to be electrifying its entire lineup, including possible hybrid versions of the Pilot, Passport, and Odyssey, which will push sales and revenue for the automaker while preparing for another wave of EV push.

Toyota recently pulled a similar move for its upcoming electric SUV, delaying its American-built SUVs and reallocating its upcoming production due to the popularity of the Grand Highlander. The launch of the two EVs will now happen in late 2026 and 2028. Ford also recently announced a detour in its EV plans, which involves allowing Nissan to use a part of its flagship battery manufacturing facility in Kentucky.",https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/honda-0-suv-exterior-front-quarter-03.jpg,N,,2025-07-06 12:19:01.909557

“These programs that require compliance with a radical climate agenda undermine American farmers and ranchers, threaten to drive up costs for consumers, and weaken food security for working families.”","Eleven state agriculture commissioners called on the Trump administration and Congress to yank funding from United Nations programs that they say are hurting American farmers.

“The federal government should stop using American taxpayer dollars to fund the United Nations International Maritime Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, and the United Nations Environment Program, because each of these organizations’ net-zero policies will have devastating effects on American consumers, farmers, and ranchers, and further endanger food security for the poor in America,” said the July 1 letter.

“Net-zero” refers to policies that aim to reduce the net amount of carbon emissions to zero by the year 2050, either by fully eliminating them or by offsetting them.

The letter continues:

The U.S. should also eliminate funding for these organizations due to the harmful effects of their policies on American agriculture. The U.S. contributed (by far) the largest share of any country to FAO’s [Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations] 2023 budget, accounting for $391 million of the $1.5 billion total. This contribution was over two-and-a-half times more than the second-highest contributor (Germany with $154 million). And the U.S. was the second largest contributor to UNEP [United Nations Environment Program] in 2023, providing over $49 million of a $502.6 million budget. The U.S. (one of IMO’s [United Nations International Maritime Organization] 176 member states) contributed $1.5 million of IMO’s $20 million 2023 budget, making it the 14th-largest funder of the IMO.

The letter went to Trump Cabinet officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.

It also went to Senate and House Budget Committee Chairmen Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Jody Arrington, R-Texas, respectively, as well as Senate and House Agriculture Committee Chairmen John Boozman, R-Ark., and Glenn Thompson, R-Pa., among other members of Congress.

Elected and appointed state agriculture officials signed the letter, arguing that the U.N. agencies’ net-zero policies violate President Donald Trump’s executive order to withdraw from U.N. groups that have strayed from their missions.

“We continue to see programs being funded by U.S. taxpayers that are pushing a radical climate agenda through the agriculture industry,” said Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, a group that has teamed up with state officials in the past to combat taxpayer funding of left-leaning causes.

“The Trump administration has made it clear that energy policies should be focused on unleashing America’s energy dominance, not woke, net-zero policies. America’s farmers and ranchers don’t just feed our nation; they feed the world,” Hild added in a public statement. “These programs that require compliance with a radical climate agenda undermine American farmers and ranchers, threaten to drive up costs for consumers, and weaken food security for working families.”",https://www.dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AgComs-UN.jpg,N,,2025-07-06 11:11:31.722677

About 9% of the $261 billion in green factory investment announced since 2021 has been shelved — most of it since President Donald Trump returned to office in January — according to research firm Atlas Public Policy.
Close to the Kore site is the suburban sprawl that’s come to characterize the Phoenix area’s rapid growth.
It’s one of 53 out of 715 green factories announced since 2021 that have been cancelled, according to Atlas Public Policy.
“Maybe another green energy one will,” he said.","The vast tract of land off Route 85 was meant to be a symbol of Made-in-America manufacturing. A billion-dollar battery factory was going to rise, bringing thousands of new jobs. The business announced, “Get Ready Arizona,” the governor said the state was thrilled and even the US president gave the project a shoutout.

But here, in the boomtown of Buckeye, less than an hour away from Phoenix, the 214-acre lot sits empty. Work on the site had started, said Shelby Lizarraga, who manages the gas station next door, “but then it went all quiet.”

Four years after the fanfare, battery maker Kore Power Inc. abandoned its plans for a plant in Buckeye. The company’s chief executive officer stepped down and a promised $850 million federal loan was cancelled.

Kore isn’t alone in its dashed ambitions. In Massachusetts, a wind turbine cable factory set to be built on the site of a former coal power plant was scrapped. In Georgia, the construction of a facility that would have made parts for electric vehicle batteries was suspended more than halfway through. And in Colorado, a lithium-ion battery maker said it wouldn’t go forward with its factory there, at least for now.

They’re among the dozens of planned green factories that have been cancelled, with more delayed or downsized, all hit by soaring costs, high interest rates and slow-growing EV demand. About 9% of the $261 billion in green factory investment announced since 2021 has been shelved — most of it since President Donald Trump returned to office in January — according to research firm Atlas Public Policy. Energy Secretary Chris Wright has said his agency doesn’t plan to move forward with some of the big-dollar loans that had been made to green manufacturing plants during President Joe Biden’s term.

Now there’s another, major threat to the sector: Trump’s massive tax-and-spending package, which rolls back Biden’s generous green subsidies.

Signed into law by Trump on Friday, it phases out credits for producing solar and wind energy years before they were designed to expire. It also ends federal tax credits for electric vehicles this September instead of in 2032.

Under Biden, a Democratic Congress passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in 2021 and the Inflation Reduction Act a year later, setting aside hundreds of billions of dollars in incentives for clean-energy projects. New factories were announced from South Carolina to Michigan to Arizona, set to churn out EVs, batteries and clean-energy parts. Biden and Democrats sought to bring manufacturing back to the US and make the country independent of, and competitive with, fast-electrifying China.

Many of the projects would be in red and purple states, shielding the policy against GOP attacks — or so the thinking went. That idea has now collapsed. (Among the members of Congress who voted for Trump’s bill was Paul Gosar, a Republican who represents Buckeye.)

Trump said at the signing that the country “is going to be a rocketship economically.” But fallout is likely to include more clean energy projects and the jobs they provide, or could have. Tesla Inc. Chief Elon Musk had lambasted the package on X as “severely damaging” to “industries of the future.”

The US pulling back now means it will lag other countries that have invested in green technologies, and that will hurt economic growth and boost reliance on overseas manufacturers long term, said Hannah Hess of Rhodium Group, a research firm.

“There’s also the risk of stranded investments, a sizable amount,” she said.

Lithium-ion battery manufacturers like Kore face strict rules on using foreign components, plus knock-on effects from the solar and EV credit phaseouts. Because of the former, fewer grid batteries will be installed over the next decade, according to the research group Energy Innovation. The demise of the EV credit will likely dent consumer appetite for electric vehicles — and by extension, demand for the batteries they run on.

Buckeye — a former farming town named by settlers from Ohio — is a hotbed of building activity. Close to the Kore site is the suburban sprawl that’s come to characterize the Phoenix area’s rapid growth. Concrete is being poured in foundations and piles of rebar are stacked on construction sites, where tracts of desert are being transformed into new neighborhoods.

Executives at Kore had scoured 300 sites across the country before settling on Buckeye. Land was cheap, it was close to major West Coast ports and Arizona’s dry climate wouldn’t impair the chemistry of lithium-ion batteries. The company announced its factory in 2021, planning to start construction that year and roll out batteries in 2023. It would be Buckeye’s biggest employer, creating 3,000 jobs.

But as executives drew up construction plans, inflation hiked costs, while rising interest rates made financing more expensive. And the project got mired in the same slow permitting that stalls projects nationwide.

Costs swelled to $1.25 billion from $1 billion, so the company made adjustments to control expenses — even downsizing the factory — and worked aggressively to keep the project alive, Kore’s current CEO Jay Bellows said in a telephone interview. “We were trying to move as fast as we could,” Bellows said. “But ultimately, the costs were just really high.” The battery maker later got a loan commitment from the Energy Department.

Kore ended up getting approvals to move forward with construction in 2024, almost a year after it had wanted to start producing batteries. And then uncertainty loomed over the fate of federal green incentives if Trump were to win the election.

In Buckeye’s city hall, about 10 minutes away from Kore’s site, Mayor Eric Orsborn sensed that things were amiss. The project’s timeline kept getting longer and delays dragged out. “Things slipped a little bit more, a little bit more,” he said in an interview in his office.

Kore then said it was ending its plans to build in Buckeye, 10 days after Trump was sworn in. It’s one of 53 out of 715 green factories announced since 2021 that have been cancelled, according to Atlas Public Policy.

The outlook for green enterprises has darkened as policy shifts unsettle manufacturers, with EV makers feeling it the most, said Matt Shanahan of Marathon Capital, an investment bank focused on the energy transition. “The rules have changed,” he said.

The pace of cancellations and delays depends on how the market reacts to the law, he added, but early-stage projects are especially at risk. “To break ground on a new facility — I think it’s very challenging right now.” Energy storage may remain more resilient thanks to surging data center demand, he said.

Kore is now on the hunt for an existing building to move into, with power and infrastructure in place so it can save money and get to market faster, Bellows said. Looking back, he said he learned the need to move more quickly and efficiently. The company tried, he said, but “it’s a long, arduous process” to go from dirt to a fully operating factory.

Even so, other green facilities in the region are forging ahead. In Queen Creek, another fast-growing community that’s about 80 miles to the west of Buckeye, construction is underway on a $3 billion EV battery facility by LG Energy Solution. Cranes tower over the sprawling site, while bulldozers kick up plumes of desert dust as forklifts scuttle by. The project has faced its own challenges — construction was paused for some time last year as the company scrapped plans for a bigger plant.

But now the factory is set to open next year, and LG plans to employ 1,500 workers there by 2027. The company said in an April press release that it aims to contribute to a “local battery ecosystem” and that it will hire locally.

“It’s a manufacturing powerhouse,” Queen Creek Mayor Julia Wheatley said in an interview, adding that the town is seeing strong interest from companies looking to move near the plant.

On a Monday in late June, the empty Kore plot scorched in 100F-plus heat. Nearby, desert gave way to parcels of farmland, discount stores and palm-tree-lined neighborhoods. Dairy cows took shade from the heat, while trucks stacked with hay bales hurtled by.

Across the road, Joe Skoog, who runs a trucking company, said he would have liked to have pitched his business to Kore had the factory gone ahead. But he didn’t see the cancellation as much of a setback for the growing region. “Come back in five, 10 years’ time, and there will be more manufacturers and warehouses, and fewer farms,” he said.

Orsborn, Buckeye’s mayor, said he was disappointed, but not disheartened. He enthused about Buckeye’s population boom, fueled by Californian transplants, the big-box retailers and movie theaters opening up and howKore’s shovel-ready site — with power, water and infrastructure now installed — is now even more attractive for other businesses that want to move in.

“Maybe another green energy one will,” he said.

Currently, Huawei doesn’t manufacture its own branded vehicles in China, but instead works with various automakers to apply some of its existing technologies to vehicles.

According to the patent application, its batteries use a method that ‘dopes’ sulfide electrolytes with nitrogen to address side reactions at the lithium interface. However, it is keeping the remainder of its technology close to its chest, as the race to mass-produce solid-state battery technology safely and at scale is well and truly on.

What’s more, the company theorizes that it is able to eke some 1,864 miles of range from its battery technology, as well as complete the industry standard 10-80% charge in less than five minutes.

However, some industry experts are skeptical of those bold claims, pointing out that it is a leap of more than three times the current range abilities of the most impressive electric vehicles on sale today.

Speaking to Electrek, Yang Min-ho, professor of energy engineering at Dankook University, said that such performance “might be possible in lab conditions” but went on to explain that reproducing the results in the real world, where energy loss and thermal management play a key role, would be “extremely difficult”.

The professor was also quick to point out that the nitrogen doping method is a “standard technique” that, again, can be applied in a laboratory environment but is currently difficult to scale to a point where it can be mass produced to meet the demands of global automakers.

Understandably, China is basking in its EV dominance at the moment and it isn’t afraid to publicize innovations that have the potential to change the game.

MegaWatt charging is one of the more recent topics, but solid-state batteries have also been bubbling sway under the surface for some time. Undoubtedly, China will be the first to this technology, but it likely won’t be as soon as many domestic companies make out, nor as impressive.

What’s more, the 1,800-mile figures seem largely pointless, as it would require a huge battery pack that is going to add excess weight and blunt driving dynamics in a vain attempt to dispel notions of range anxiety.

Should Huawei be able to nail energy densities between 400 and 500 Wh/kg, it would be far better placed producing smaller packs that can still offer an impressive range without the need for enormous, expensive batteries.

When an EV can easily cover 600 miles on a single charge, range anxiety largely becomes obsolete, as there are so few drivers that want to sit for hours on end without a break. Plus, with the public charging network expanding and improving year-on-year, it is now arguably easier than ever to find a spot to plug in and stretch the legs.",https://mitechnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Huawei-华为-Logo.png,N,,2025-07-06 12:20:21.076543

Duke Energy has embarked on a substantial capital expenditure (capex) plan, with projections ranging from $82.5 billion to $83 billion over the next five years. This investment is primarily directed towards generation and grid improvements, positioning the company for long-term growth and efficiency gains. The scale of this capex plan is noteworthy, with analysts projecting one of the highest capex growth rates among regulated utilities, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.5% from 2025 to 2029.

A key component of Duke Energy’s strategy is its focus on cleaner energy sources. The company has set ambitious targets to reduce carbon emissions by 50% by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. These goals not only align with broader industry trends but also enhance Duke Energy’s sustainability credentials, potentially attracting environmentally conscious investors and customers.

Strategic partnerships play a crucial role in Duke Energy’s growth plans. A notable collaboration with GE Vernova allows the company to secure gas turbines efficiently, supporting its plan to add over 5 gigawatts (GW) of gas generation by 2029. This partnership exemplifies Duke Energy’s approach to leveraging industry relationships to gain competitive advantages and streamline its expansion efforts.

Financial Performance and Outlook

Duke Energy’s financial projections paint a picture of steady growth. The company has guided for 2025 earnings per share (EPS) in the range of $6.17 to $6.42, with a midpoint of $6.30, representing a 5.4% year-over-year growth. Looking further ahead, Duke Energy aims for an EPS CAGR of 5% to 7%, with expectations to achieve the upper half of this range by the end of the decade. InvestingPro analysis reveals the company’s strong dividend track record, having raised dividends for 17 consecutive years and maintained payments for 55 years straight. With current annual revenue of $30.5 billion and an EBITDA of $14.9 billion, Duke Energy demonstrates robust financial fundamentals despite trading above its Fair Value according to InvestingPro’s proprietary valuation model.

Analysts are optimistic about Duke Energy’s growth trajectory. Projections suggest an EPS CAGR of 6.8% from 2025 to 2029, slightly above the street consensus of 6.7%. This growth is expected to be driven by the company’s robust capex plan and increasing power demand, particularly in its core markets such as the Carolinas.

The company’s dividend policy also reflects its financial health and commitment to shareholder returns. Projections indicate annual increases in dividends per share, rising from $4.06 in 2023 to an estimated $4.35 in 2026.

Regulatory Environment

Duke Energy operates in a heavily regulated industry, and its performance is significantly influenced by regulatory outcomes. Recent developments have been largely positive for the company. A favorable final order in Duke Energy Indiana’s General Rate Case by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) approved a two-step revenue requirement increase and a 9.75% Return on Equity (ROE). This outcome has substantially derisked Duke Energy’s regulatory calendar, allowing investors to focus on the company’s refreshed 5-year financial outlook and growth prospects.

However, the regulatory landscape remains a double-edged sword. While recent outcomes have been favorable, future regulatory challenges could pose risks to Duke Energy’s growth plans and financial performance. The company must continue to navigate complex regulatory environments across its operating regions to ensure continued success.

Bear Case

How might regulatory challenges impact Duke Energy’s growth plans?

Despite recent favorable regulatory outcomes, Duke Energy remains vulnerable to potential shifts in the regulatory landscape. Future rate cases or policy changes could result in less favorable terms, potentially impacting the company’s ability to recover costs or maintain desired ROEs. This could lead to reduced earnings growth or necessitate adjustments to the company’s ambitious capex plans.

Moreover, the potential repeal of nuclear production tax credits (PTCs) or failure to qualify for them could significantly impact Duke Energy’s financial projections. Such a scenario might require additional equity issuance, potentially diluting shareholder value and putting pressure on the company’s credit ratings.

What risks does Duke Energy face in executing its large-scale capex projects?

The scale of Duke Energy’s capex plan, while promising for growth, also presents significant execution risks. Large-scale infrastructure projects are inherently complex and can face delays, cost overruns, or technical challenges. Any major setbacks in implementing these projects could impact the company’s financial performance and growth trajectory.

Additionally, the rapid pace of technological change in the energy sector poses a risk. Investments made today may become less competitive or even obsolete if new, more efficient technologies emerge. Duke Energy must carefully balance its investments in current technologies with the flexibility to adapt to future innovations.

Bull Case

How does Duke Energy’s strategic partnerships position it for future growth?

Duke Energy’s strategic partnerships, such as its collaboration with GE Vernova, provide the company with significant competitive advantages. These relationships allow Duke Energy to secure critical equipment and technologies efficiently, supporting its ambitious expansion plans. The partnership with GE Vernova, in particular, enables Duke Energy to add substantial gas generation capacity, a key component of its transition strategy.

Furthermore, these partnerships may open doors to new technologies and innovations, potentially giving Duke Energy early access to cutting-edge solutions in areas such as grid modernization and renewable energy integration. This positions the company well to adapt to the evolving energy landscape and maintain its leadership in the sector.

What opportunities does Duke Energy have in new nuclear generation and SMRs?

Duke Energy is well-positioned to capitalize on opportunities in new nuclear generation, including small modular reactors (SMRs). As the energy sector continues to seek low-carbon baseload power sources, nuclear energy, particularly advanced technologies like SMRs, could play a crucial role.

The company’s existing expertise in nuclear operations, combined with its strong regulatory relationships and financial resources, places it in an advantageous position to pursue these opportunities. Successful development and deployment of new nuclear technologies could provide Duke Energy with a significant competitive edge, supporting its long-term growth and sustainability goals.

Experts say that, regardless of the excise tax reprieve and the included grandfather provisions, the clean energy industry will be badly hurt and consumers’ energy prices could rise by eight to 10 percent.

As a whole, the clean energy sector added 400,000 new jobs from 2020 to 2023, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.
Powered by its strong economic fundamentals, the clean power industry seems unlikely to be crushed by the Trump administration’s hostile measures.","The American clean power industry is thriving and making a significant contribution to the U.S. economy thanks to policies of the Biden-Harris administration, as well as the highly competitive prices and speed with which clean power systems and energy storage can be currently installed. But the industry is now facing an all-out assault from President Donald Trump.

His signature “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which Trump signed into law on July 4, heavily targets the industry, which Trump has labeled the “green new scam.” The legislation eliminates a 30 percent tax credit for residential rooftop solar panels by the end of 2025, as well as those dedicated to utility-scale solar and wind, although plants that are already financed and approved by June 2026 — or that are operational by 2027 — can still qualify for the credits. (The credit for solar leasing companies will also last through 2027 and can be passed through to consumers.) The bill also eliminates tax credits for electric vehicles and chargers, as well as battery storage systems, geothermal heating, electric panel upgrades, energy audits and weatherization, all of which can lower consumer’s energy bills.

In a last minute move, however, Republicans struck a proposed excise tax on wind and solar projects if the materials included a percentage of minerals sourced from certain foreign countries. Experts say that, regardless of the excise tax reprieve and the included grandfather provisions, the clean energy industry will be badly hurt and consumers’ energy prices could rise by eight to 10 percent.

The clean energy industry’s growth and hefty economic impacts are due in part to former president Joe Biden’s signature $1.2 trillion Infrastructure and Jobs Act of 2021 and the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which he signed into law the following year.

The clean energy industry’s growth and hefty economic impacts are due in part to former president Joe Biden’s signature $1.2 trillion Infrastructure and Jobs Act of 2021 and the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which he signed into law the following year. The latter provided for $369 billion in clean energy and climate-related spending over 10 ten years to nurture renewable technologies, including EVs, energy-efficient appliances, rooftop solar panels and batteries, geothermal heating, heat pumps, industrial clean energy storage and biogas systems.

The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act contained billions for the electrification of transportation and a rapid expansion of electric vehicle charging stations. Calling it a “landmark bill,” the League of Conservation Voters said it also makes it easier for everyday people to save hundreds or thousands of dollars on energy costs and transition to clean energy in their homes, vehicles, schools and businesses while reducing fossil-fuel emissions.

New cost-effective technologies — such as ultra-high performance bifacial solar panels, which are able to absorb light from both sides of the panel and deliver over 700 Watts per module with little output degradation over 30 years — have contributed to the industry’s positive economic impact. Solar power is now often cheaper than the operating costs, let alone the construction costs, of older coal plants which take years to build and permit, and there is at least a six-year wait for new combustion turbines used in gas-fired power plants. By contrast, solar plants can be built in six to 18 months. Of the new power capacity added to the grid in 2024, 96 percent was non-carbon based energy.

The industry employs 3.5 million Americans. According to a new report from the American Clean Power Association (ACP), “Clean power manufacturing contributes $18 billion to GDP [Gross Domestic Product] annually,” creates $33 billion in investment “and supports 122,000 American jobs” with an average salary of $118,000 a year.

As a whole, the clean energy sector added 400,000 new jobs from 2020 to 2023, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Had the industry remained unfettered, its manufacturing could have contributed $86 billion to the GDP annually and supported over 575,000 jobs by 2030, with those investments coming mainly in rural Republican areas.

Trump had the renewable energy industry in his sights from the first day of his new administration, when he signed an executive order proclaiming a national energy emergency — even though, under Biden, the U.S. produced more oil and natural gas than any other nation and was the world’s third-largest coal producer. The order was seen by many as fulfillment of Trump’s promise to strip away regulations on the fossil-fuel industry, from which he requested $1 billion in contributions to his 2024 presidential campaign.

In his emergency declaration, Trump contended that all aspects of energy and critical minerals — leasing, development, production, transportation, refining and generation — “are all far too inadequate to meet our Nation’s needs.”

Accusing the prior administration of “harmful and shortsighted policies” that allegedly created “inadequate energy supply” and high energy prices, the order declared those policies created “a national emergency” requiring swift, decisive action to avoid a dramatic future crisis “due to a high demand for energy and natural resources to power the next generation of technology,” presumably AI.

The U.S. does have an emergency, Dr. Daniel Kammen told Grist in the wake of Trump’s executive order. A distinguished professor of energy at the University of California at Berkeley and a former U.S. science envoy, he said it’s not one caused by energy scarcity but by the nation’s heavy dependence on fossil fuels and the relatively leisurely pace of its transition to clean energy, despite the global climate crisis.

The emergency declaration also seeks to weaken enforcement of environmental regulations, including those covered by the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act, and to eliminate regulations that might impede the construction of oil and gas pipelines and other fossil-fuel facilities. It omits any mention of providing clean, safe and sustainable energy.

The order was correct, however, in stating that the nation needs a reliable, diversified and affordable supply of energy — and in recognizing that AI technology is sharply increasing U.S. power needs.

In Memphis, Tenn., the xAI Colossus data center, owned by billionaire Elon Musk, uses inefficient and highly-polluting portable gas turbine generators, which are typically intended for short-term or emergency use, to meet much of the plant’s ongoing power demand. The data center currently consumes 300 megawatts of power, enough to power 100,000 homes, according to CNN, and is seen as a threat and a corporate polluter by many residents of Boxtown, a majority Black, low-income community.

ACP Executive Director Jason Grumet, calling attention to “skyrocketing demand” for power in the U.S., said that “two Texas[es]” worth of new demand is being added to the grid every decade. “Our country deserves better than a Congress that plays ping pong with our economy and our security.”

Eager to sway Congress in its favor, the industry now has in place a $40 million lobbying campaign to defend its interests. “We have to confront the uncomfortable reality that the greatest threat to reliable energy is an unreliable political system,” Grumet said.

Powered by its strong economic fundamentals, the clean power industry seems unlikely to be crushed by the Trump administration’s hostile measures. Now that the One Big Beautiful Bill Act has become law, the industry’s growth and financing will be severely diminished — and American families and businesses will be paying more for energy.",https://www.salon.com/app/uploads/2024/08/maintenance_worker_installing_solar_panels_to_house_1169021383.jpg,N,,2025-07-06 10:02:33.643509

America just handed a victory to the fossil fuel industry by passing the Trump administration’s “Big Beautiful Bill” in both the House and the Senate.
It took another six years for the next million barrels of road fuel to get displaced—by 2024 the world was displacing two million barrels of road fuel per day.
For context, the U.S. consumed around 20 million barrels of oil daily in 2023, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
This projected decline in oil demand means the world’s leading oil producers now have EVs on their minds.","The U.S. just handed the fossil fuel industry a big win. No matter how you look at it, that win will be short lived.

Electric vehicles are already displacing millions of barrels of oil per day, saving hundreds of millions of metric tons of carbon dioxide from entering into the atmosphere.

With or without U.S. support, the world will march on towards cleaner sources of energy.

America just handed a victory to the fossil fuel industry by passing the Trump administration’s “Big Beautiful Bill” in both the House and the Senate. But don’t mistake that for a turning point in the global trajectory of clean transport. The future of zero-emissions road travel isn’t stalling, it’s still accelerating. Despite the latest setback to EVs in Washington D.C., the world remains firmly on track for sustained EV adoption.

For starters, the bill ends the federal tax credits for clean energy programs such as solar, wind and electric vehicles years ahead of schedule. It gives tax breaks to oil and gas companies for drilling and development costs. U.S. companies are now also free to leak as much methane—a hazardous planet-warming greenhouse gas—as they want into the atmosphere for another decade, throwing out a Biden-era penalty on methane emissions.

It sounds bad—and it indeed is. Climate scientists and environmentalists have warned that the bill could seriously harm air quality, jeopardize public health and accelerate planet warming by encouraging more fossil fuel use. But according to research firm BloombergNEF’s Electric Vehicle Outlook 2025, there’s still some reason for optimism: EVs are expected to continue displacing millions of barrels of crude oil each year.

Even if the U.S. slowdown results in 14 million fewer EV sales globally by 2030, the broader transition towards cleaner energy will continue to march on across the world, according to BNEF.

In fact, the future of the oil and gas industry is looking weak, even though it managed to bag a chest-thumping victory this week in the U.S. with the passage of the Trump administration’s Big Beautiful Bill—that victory will only give petroleum companies short-term benefits. Over the long term, oil consumption is still on track to go down drastically and EV sales are expected to grow with new and more competent models.

According to BNEF’s economic transition scenario, the first million daily barrels of road fuel displacement happened in 2018 thanks to early adoption of EVs. Owners who bought EVs stopped visiting gas stations, meaning the petroleum companies started losing those regular customers. Plus, studies show the vast majority of car buyers who make the switch to EVs don’t return to gas cars.

It took another six years for the next million barrels of road fuel to get displaced—by 2024 the world was displacing two million barrels of road fuel per day. For reference, that’s almost equal to how much the whole of South Korea uses in a single day.

By the end of the decade, EVs are expected to displace more than five million barrels of road fuel per day. For context, the U.S. consumed around 20 million barrels of oil daily in 2023, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Had the clean energy policies survived, that number might have dropped even faster. But with Europe and China charging ahead with EV adoption, the U.S. will now be left behind.

This projected decline in oil demand means the world’s leading oil producers now have EVs on their minds. Big Oil has grand plans to become Big EV, as Business Insider said in 2023. The torchbearers of fossil fuels are already making huge bets on EV charging and the mining of lithium, a key raw material used in batteries.

Chevron said in June that it had acquired 125,000 hectares of land in Texas and Arkansas for lithium extraction. BP is rapidly purchasing charging hardware from Tesla and Alpitronic. And Shell Recharge, the oil company’s charging division, is already investing in charging stations worldwide. It opened its largest charging station in Shenzhen in 2023 with 258 fast-charging stalls at just one location.

The global momentum for EVs and other forms of clean energy means oil displacement will continue to grow, just without America in the lead. So even though Washington D.C. might revel in its fossil fuel party for right now, the long term fate of that industry is pretty much decided.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/Ak4Wjx/s1/evs-displace-oil.jpg,N,,2025-07-06 10:02:37.072439

The IPO's Role in Reducing Import Dependency India's solar manufacturing ecosystem is still nascent, with imports accounting for over 70% of cell production.
Investment Thesis: A Compelling Play on India's Renewable Future Emmvee's IPO offers investors a direct stake in India's energy transition, backed by: - Policy tailwinds: Government mandates and PLI schemes ensure steady demand.
- Strong fundamentals: A 3.9 GW order book and 7.8 GW capacity provide visibility.
Recommendation: Investors seeking exposure to India's renewable energy boom should consider Emmvee's IPO.","As India races toward its ambitious 500 GW renewable energy target by 2030, solar manufacturing has emerged as a cornerstone of the nation's clean energy transition. Among the companies leading this charge is Emmvee, a Bengaluru-based solar module manufacturer poised to leverage its robust order book, advanced technology, and strategic partnerships to capitalize on government incentives and investor demand. With an upcoming initial public offering (IPO) targeting ₹2,500–₹3,000 crore, Emmvee aims to solidify its position as a key player in India's solar manufacturing boom.

Leveraging Government Incentives: A Strategic Advantage

India's push for energy self-reliance has been fueled by policies like the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) mandate, which requires solar projects to use domestically produced modules. This policy has spurred a manufacturing boom, with India adding 25.3 GW of solar module capacity in 2024 alone. Emmvee is well-positioned to benefit from these tailwinds:

- 7.8 GW of module capacity: Emmvee's production facilities, including a 4-lakh-square-foot plant in Karnataka, enable it to meet domestic demand while exporting to global markets.

- Government support: Karnataka's approval of a ₹5,495 crore investment for Emmvee underscores state-level backing for its expansion, creating 2,508 jobs and strengthening its role in the state's renewable ecosystem.

- Reducing import dependency: By scaling solar cell production to 2.94 GW—matching its module capacity—Emmvee aims to minimize reliance on imported cells, aligning with India's “Atmanirbhar Bharat” (Self-Reliant India) vision.

A Robust Order Book Anchors Growth

Emmvee's order book is a testament to its execution excellence and client trust:

- ₹5,898 crore in unexecuted orders (as of January 2025) include projects for NTPC Renewable Energy, CleanMax, and Ayana Power, with deliveries scheduled through 2026.

- KPI Green's ₹1,500 crore order: A landmark deal for 1.58 GW of high-efficiency TopCon bifacial modules, manufactured at its Karnataka facilities and deployed for a Gujarat project. This partnership highlights Emmvee's technological edge and ability to deliver at scale.

- Alignment with India's 500 GW target: Emmvee's capacity expansion plans directly support the government's goal, as its modules will power utility-scale projects, solar pumps, and rooftop installations nationwide.

Technology Leadership: TopCon Bifacial Modules

Emmvee's focus on advanced solar technologies sets it apart in a competitive market:

- TopCon bifacial modules: These high-efficiency panels, capable of capturing sunlight from both sides, boost energy yield by 10–15% compared to conventional modules. They are critical for utility-scale projects, where efficiency translates to cost savings.

- Automation and quality control: Its Karnataka facilities employ state-of-the-art automation and multi-layered quality checks, ensuring compliance with global standards. This has enabled Emmvee to penetrate markets in Europe, Africa, and North America.

Comparing Emmvee to Recent Solar IPOs: A Strong Playbook

Emmvee's IPO strategy mirrors the success of peers like Waaree Energies and Premier Energies, which leveraged robust order books and government incentives to attract investors:

- Waaree's ₹4,321 crore IPO (2024): Raised capital to build a 6 GW solar manufacturing hub in Odisha. Its stock rose 86% post-listing, buoyed by a 9 GW order book.

- Premier Energies' ₹2,830 crore IPO (2023): Oversubscribed 74x, driven by its role as the largest U.S. solar cell exporter. Its valuation surged 130% post-IPO due to export demand.

- Emmvee's edge: With a 3.9 GW order book and a 7.8 GW production capacity, Emmvee's scalability and geographic diversification (domestic and international) position it to outperform.

The IPO's Role in Reducing Import Dependency

India's solar manufacturing ecosystem is still nascent, with imports accounting for over 70% of cell production. Emmvee's IPO proceeds will fund:

1. Capacity expansion: Scaling cell production to match module output, reducing reliance on imported cells.

2. Debt reduction: Lowering interest costs to improve margins.

3. Global competitiveness: Investing in R&D for next-gen technologies like heterojunction (HJT) and perovskite cells.

Risks and Considerations

Regulatory uncertainty: Changes to import duties or ALMM criteria could impact demand.

Global oversupply: A surplus of solar panels post-2025 might pressure margins.

Execution risk: Meeting capacity expansion timelines is critical to sustaining investor confidence.

Investment Thesis: A Compelling Play on India's Renewable Future

Emmvee's IPO offers investors a direct stake in India's energy transition, backed by:

- Policy tailwinds: Government mandates and PLI schemes ensure steady demand.

- Strong fundamentals: A 3.9 GW order book and 7.8 GW capacity provide visibility.

- Technological differentiation: TopCon modules and automation give Emmvee a cost and efficiency edge.

Recommendation: Investors seeking exposure to India's renewable energy boom should consider Emmvee's IPO. Its alignment with national priorities, robust order pipeline, and global reach make it a standout candidate for long-term growth.

In conclusion, Emmvee is not just another solar manufacturer—it's a catalyst for India's clean energy independence. The IPO is a critical step toward unlocking its full potential, and investors who bet on this momentum could reap rewards as the nation transitions to a greener future.",,N,,2025-07-06 12:19:23.575440

However, in recent years, new natural gas plants have constituted a small share of new capacity additions to the overall U.S. electricity mix.
Increased natural gas demand from growing liquified natural gas exports is a primary driver for these cost increases, according to the EIA.
It’s a textbook Econ 101 example—exporting LNG abroad where natural gas prices are much higher raises demand for U.S.-produced gas.
Over same time period, 340 fewer gigawatts of clean energy would also not get built.","Remember the era of cheap natural gas? Yea, that world is gone.

Utilities and tech companies may be clamoring to build new gas-fired power plants to meet rising energy demand, but no matter how much they envision gas as a solution, there’s no escaping gas’s expensive, bad-for-the-climate reality. Anyone harboring the illusion of low-cost gas is operating as if it’s still 2015.

“I think people have in their minds that gas is a cheap way to generate power”, said Rich Powell, CEO of trade group the Clean Energy Buyers Association. “New build natural gas is not a cheap way to generate electricity.”

Today, gas’s economics are facing pressure on two fronts: Supply chain bottlenecks and workforce shortages have made it nearly impossible to source equipment for new gas-fired power plants in the near to medium term while also raising the costs of those plants. And gas as a fuel is becoming more expensive as global demand for liquified natural gas intensifies and the United States exports more of the fossil fuel instead of keeping it within our borders to meet American demand.

The shale revolution did usher in an era of cheap gas that reshaped the U.S. energy landscape, with gas overtaking coal in electricity generation around 2016. However, in recent years, new natural gas plants have constituted a small share of new capacity additions to the overall U.S. electricity mix.

In fact, since the 2018 surge, nearly every megawatt of new generation added to the grid has been clean energy—96% of new power in 2024 and 85% in 2023. That’s largely because for more than half a decade, renewables have been the cheapest sources of new electricity.

A gas buildout would look different this time

The big surge of new U.S. gas-fired power plant additions came in the early 2000s, before leveling off to a more moderate pace where the slowdown triggered several reactions that could make it hard to quickly build new gas plants today.

It turns out building gas plants is a use-it-or-lose-it skill.

Gas turbine manufacturers such as GE Vernova and Siemens Energy scaled back their production capabilities to meet lower demand, and output can’t be increased overnight. As a result, new gas turbine orders face a wait time of five to seven years before they can be delivered to utilities.

“Gas turbines were dead in 2022,” Siemens Energy North America President Rich Voorberg said at a recent conference, noting the company had been down to one customer.

Additionally, the slowdown in gas plant construction led to a brain drain, with NextEra CEO John Ketchum explaining much of the workforce that built the early 2000s boom has retired or moved to other fields, leaving behind a serious labor shortage.

Because of these factors, not only will it take years to build more natural gas-fired power plants, they’ll also be more expensive this time around. NextEra’s Ketchum estimates building a new plant today would cost three times as much as the last facility the utility built, back in 2022.

Others agree. ""We did a quote and to do the same kind of unit that had been built a few years back it would be two and a half times more today,"" Paul Sotkiewicz, president and founder of consultant E-Cubed Policy Associates.

He’s not alone in this sentiment.

""We are seeing substantial increases in the estimates for new builds, including everything from the cost of engineering, procurement and construction to the cost of equipment and materials,"" said Bobby Noble, senior program manager for Gas Turbine Research and Development at EPRI.

The fuel to run gas plants costs more too

Then there’s the other side of the coin—not only will it cost much more to build a natural gas plant in today’s world, but the fuel that plant will burn is becoming significantly more expensive. The U.S. Energy Information Administration predicts Henry Hub prices—the main benchmark for natural gas prices—will increase by 43% in 2025 and another 27% in 2026. Increased natural gas demand from growing liquified natural gas exports is a primary driver for these cost increases, according to the EIA.

It’s a textbook Econ 101 example—exporting LNG abroad where natural gas prices are much higher raises demand for U.S.-produced gas. And when demand goes up, so does the price.

“It is not clear how both the AI and LNG export boom, both of which need prodigious volumes of gas, can succeed without provoking price spikes,” Gas Outlook recently reported.

“The explosion of (LNG) exports has upended domestic energy markets ... and has exposed American energy markets to increased price volatility and episodes of sharply higher prices,” said Tyson Slocum, director of Public Citizen’s energy program.

The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” makes the problem even worse

There’s no question U.S. electricity demand will increase in the coming years, although exactly what the rate of growth will be remains an open question. But relying on natural gas to fill the gap over at least the next five years appears to be both a foolhardy and highly expensive gamble. Instead, we should be increasing the pace of wind, solar, and storage buildout, as these technologies are currently the fastest, most affordable ways to add more power to the grid. Unfortunately, Congress just built a giant roadblock for clean energy.

The new One Big Beautiful Bill Act would repeals renewable energy incentives and puts in place overly complicated supply chain constraints, killing many of the domestic clean energy projects that had been projected to come online over the next few years. That will increase wholesale electricity costs by 74% over the next decade, according to Energy Innovation analysis. Over same time period, 340 fewer gigawatts of clean energy would also not get built.

Thus, we face a scenario where we need more power quickly, can’t get the materials or staff needed to build new gas plants that would be wildly expensive anyway, and we’re taking big chunks of fast, cheap clean energy off the table.

That’s a great blueprint for losing the AI race and making America expensive again.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68669ec79d6b635d23df1ff2/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-07-06 09:04:47.205343

Comanche is the largest coal-burning power plant in the state, and two of its three operating units still create electricity from coal.
Even though Xcel plans to shutter Comanche’s Unit 3 within five years, it still needed to renew its Title V air permit, the document that details how much pollution the company is allowed to spew into the air.
So Nichols believes it is necessary for the state to put the closure date in the Title V permit.
“I think that emphasizes the need to find perhaps more creative ways to ensure that the Comanche coal-fired power plant retirement dates are fully set in stone through this Title V permit.”","If all goes as planned, Xcel Energy is applying for its last federal air-pollution permit for a coal-fired power plant in Colorado.

But environmentalists worry that is a big “if” as long as the Trump administration is in power, and now they are asking the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment to include the Comanche Generating Station’s projected closure date of Jan. 1, 2031, in the Pueblo power plant’s latest Title V air permit.

They hope putting the date in a permit that needs Environmental Protection Agency approval will guarantee that Xcel, the largest utility company operating in Colorado, will shutter its last coal-fired power plant in the state by that deadline.

“I really want to emphasize the need to ensure that these retirement dates, which Xcel has committed to and everybody has agreed to, are established and set in stone via this Title V air permit,” said Jeremy Nichols, a senior advocate for the Center for Biological Diversity. “Right now, the federal government has launched an unprecedented assault on states like Colorado who are trying to do their part to confront the climate crisis and protect clean air and to enable a transition from coal to clean energy.”

Colorado’s utility companies have been planning for nearly two decades to shutter their coal-burning power plants and transition to cleaner alternatives, including natural gas, solar and wind power. Comanche is the largest coal-burning power plant in the state, and two of its three operating units still create electricity from coal.

Xcel is on track to shutter Comanche’s Unit 2 in September and remains committed to closing the plant’s Unit 3, which generates 750 megawatts of electricity, by January 2031, said Michelle Aguayo, a Xcel Colorado spokeswoman. Unit 1 is already closed.

“We continue to make significant progress towards our emission reduction goals approved by the state, which would require us to retire our coal units by (the end of) 2030,” Aguayo wrote in a statement. “We’re working with the administration and our states to continue delivering customers safe, clean, reliable energy while keeping our customers’ bills as low as possible.”

But President Donald Trump and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin want the United States to continue burning coal, saying it is needed now more than ever to fuel a growing demand for electricity. That demand is being sparked, in part, by a growing reliance on artificial intelligence, which consumes massive amounts of power.

In April, Trump signed executive orders aimed at boosting the industry, calling it “America’s beautiful, clean coal,” and vowing to prevent states from curtailing its use. As part of that push, the president has ordered utilities in Michigan and Pennsylvania to keep their coal plants open even when some were on the verge of shutting down.

But Colorado officials pushed back, with Gov. Jared Polis calling the president’s orders “federal overreach.” By eliminating coal-fired power plants, Colorado will inch closer to meeting its goals for cutting greenhouse gas emissions and addressing climate change.

Now, though, Polis’ regulators are being asked to put that commitment in writing.

“We are exploring if we would have legal authority to include an enforceable retirement date for Comanche’s Unit 3 coal plant in the draft Title V operating permit — and what exactly that would mean,” said Kate Malloy, an Air Pollution Control Division spokeswoman.

Coal is a dirty substance, emitting more carbon dioxide than other energy sources and accelerating climate change. Coal also contains multiple other contaminants such as mercury, sulfur dioxide, fine particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide that are released into the air and are a threat to human health.

It also leaves a toxic byproduct called coal ash, which contains arsenic, lithium, selenium, cobalt and other metals, that must be dumped into landfills in the state. Millions of tons of coal ash are buried in Colorado, and at least three sites have been documented as leaking lithium and selenium into groundwater.

Even though Xcel plans to shutter Comanche’s Unit 3 within five years, it still needed to renew its Title V air permit, the document that details how much pollution the company is allowed to spew into the air.

Under the proposed permit, the amount of pollution coming from Comanche would be reduced by thousands of tons of particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds and hazardous air pollutants, said Carrisa Money, the state health department’s Title V operating permits unit manager.

The permits are supposed to be renewed every five years. Xcel’s was last renewed in 2018.

Xcel submitted its renewal application in 2022, and now the Colorado health department is on the verge of approving it.

The state’s Air Quality Control Commission, which sets state air pollution regulations, on Tuesday held a public hearing on the permit application at which five people asked the state to do its part to slow climate change. Another 54 people submitted letters, most of which asked for the closure date to be included in the permit.

“We want to be responsive to the feedback we have received and do what’s best for Colorado, so we are working to evaluate this issue,” Malloy said in an emailed statement. “Once we have an answer, we will respond to public comments as appropriate.”

Utility companies like Xcel plan for years to shutter power plants as they replace coal with cleaner power generation. And they set goals with approvals from the Colorado Public Utilities Commission, which is responsible for making sure there is enough power surging through the grid to keep people’s lights on at an affordable price.

Malloy noted that the Comanche Unit 3 retirement date is enforceable through the company’s clean energy plans, which are required by state law and were submitted with Xcel’s electric resource plan to the PUC. The Air Pollution Control Division supports clean energy plans by verifying data and sharing them for public review and input, she said.

“Even if a federally enforceable permit condition were not on the table, the state does still have oversight and enforcement authority for coal plant retirement dates,” Malloy said.

But that hasn’t stopped Trump from making his demands. So Nichols believes it is necessary for the state to put the closure date in the Title V permit.

“We urge Colorado to create a bulwark, a defense, so to speak, against the federal government’s attacks on our climate progress and our progress in transitioning away from coal,” Nichols said during Tuesday’s public hearing on the permit. “I think that emphasizes the need to find perhaps more creative ways to ensure that the Comanche coal-fired power plant retirement dates are fully set in stone through this Title V permit.”",https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/TDP-L-Environmental-Justice-RJS-0010_b359a5.jpg?w=1024&h=706,N,,2025-07-06 09:04:51.630894

The heatwave that brought 100-degree temperatures to the Philadelphia region in June also brought warnings that the air quality was unhealthy for sensitive groups.

This was not a coincidence.

Heat and sunlight are key ingredients in the reaction that creates ground-level ozone, a common air pollutant that can cause coughing, wheezing and more frequent asthma attacks.

Ozone is what’s known as a secondary pollutant. It forms from other pollutants produced by sources such as cars, trucks and power plants.

In an urban area like Philadelphia, the air already contains plenty of these precursor pollutants, said Kabindra Shakya, a professor at Villanova University who studies air quality.

She said that hot days can also bring poor air quality because increased air conditioner use drives up emissions from power plants.

“Besides that, during these hot days, generally you’ll see the wind speed is low, which creates stagnant conditions that can somehow trap the air pollution in these areas, so there is not so much of the transport that can clean up the air,” she said.

Trump admin EPA scraps limits on climate-warming emissions, while continuing to cut funding for “crucial” mitigation and infrastructure projects.

“PublicSource is an independent nonprofit newsroom serving the Pittsburgh region. Sign up for our free newsletters.”

Sweeping federal funding cuts have halted a slate of local projects intended to reduce emissions and bolster resilience to climate change. The cuts come as U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin continues to repeal environmental regulations.

Local advocates warn that EPA rollbacks could have dire consequences for communities, especially as funding for local programs is cut and parts of the Pittsburgh region already struggle with industrial pollution.

On June 11, Zeldin moved to erase federal limits on greenhouse gas emissions from coal and gas-fired power plants, and to strip restrictions on hazardous emissions including arsenic, mercury and lead.

The proposals are the latest in a series of deregulatory actions and funding cuts by President Trump’s administration, dubbed the “biggest deregulatory action in U.S. history.”

The EPA contends that the moves will lower the cost of living for American families, bring jobs and manufacturing into local communities, eliminate “trillions” in regulatory costs and “unleash American energy”.

“We are driving a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion,” Zeldin said earlier this year.

The recent easing of power plant emission restrictions came after the cancellation of several EPA grants that supported local efforts to cut emissions and build climate resilience.

Cuts “devastate” environmental protection

The recent rollbacks have been met with opposition from environmental advocates who say that, if approved, the moves are certain to harm public health and the environment.

The Breathe Project called the latest EPA rollback “a gift to fossil fuel lobbyists and industry at the expense to the health and well-being of our country.”

The local nonprofit, which also represents a coalition of environmental organizations under the Breathe Collaborative, pointed to research from Harvard University that it said attributed “over 25,380 extra deaths per year of people older than 14 years old due to exposure to PM2.5 from fossil fuels.”

“Everything is getting dirtier because of the decisions being made by this administration, and I don’t think that anyone voted for that,” said David Hess, who served as secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection [DEP] in the early 2000s. Hess said EPA proposals to eliminate grants to state regulators like the DEP “will incapacitate state environmental protection efforts,” which backstop deregulation at the federal level.

The White House’s recommended cuts, detailed in a recent budget proposal, “will devastate economic development, critical infrastructure, and environmental protections across the nation,” wrote the Environmental Council of the States, a nonpartisan association of state environmental regulators, including the Pennsylvania DEP, in a May 3 letter to Zeldin.

In Pennsylvania, Hess said, that’s likely to mean fewer inspections, enforcement and permit reviews for a DEP that’s already struggling to keep up.

A coalition of environmental advocacy organizations in Pennsylvania, including PennFuture, GASP and Physicians for Social Responsibility, issued a collective statement on the EPA rollback on June 11.

By rolling back these protections, this will increase carbon pollution stemming from power plants that exacerbate the climate crisis, the coalition wrote. “These rollbacks combined with the administration’s all out assault on climate will cost lives and livelihoods of Pennsylvanians across the state.”

Dr. Stephanie Maximous, a pulmonologist and assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, said the most recent EPA rollbacks pose a “major problem” for the region, despite Allegheny County’s last coal-fired power plant being demolished in 2023. “All of the air is shared.”

Air quality is already among the worst in the country, Maximous said, pointing to a recent failing grade from the American Lung Association, but it’s also come a long way since the heyday of industry in Allegheny County. That improvement, Maximous said, is because of regulation. Now, “we’re going in the wrong direction,” she said.

“Everybody in the Pittsburgh region and Allegheny County stands to have worsened health outcomes” due to the EPA rollbacks, Maximous said. “It puts our local residents at risk.”

EPA cuts stall climate resiliency, green workforce projects

As the Trump administration moves to strip limits on climate-warming emissions, the EPA has clawed back funding for projects intended to address the local impacts of climate change, including landslides, flooding and associated workforce development and cleanup efforts.

The EPA “abruptly cancelled” a $930,000 grant to the Allegheny County Health Department, according to spokesperson Ronnie Das. The grant was intended to fund 10 new green infrastructure stormwater projects aimed at reducing flood damage in designated environmental justice communities, including Braddock, Homestead, Swissvale and Wilmerding. It was also set to finance litter cleanups in 10 local communities. The initiative was a partnership among the University of Pittsburgh’s Swanson School of Engineering and two local nonprofits, Landforce and Allegheny Cleanways.

News of the cancellation came in late March, days before work was scheduled to begin on a project aimed at mitigating stormwater damage at the Westgate Condominiums in Wilkinsburg.

The county does not plan to continue the project after losing “crucial funding,” according to Das, who added that the funds “may have been cut because of the words ‘environmental justice’ being attached to it.”

Separately, Allegheny County lost $4.1 million that was awarded in early January by the U.S. Department of Transportation for the installation of 150 new electric vehicle charging stations. The grant was set to “accelerate the transition to clean energy and promote sustainable transportation across our region,” U.S. Rep. Summer Lee said at the time.

That funding was matched with an additional $2 million from Duquesne Light Company, which, along with other project partners including the City of Pittsburgh, the Allegheny County Airport Authority, the Pittsburgh Parking Authority and 14 local municipalities, are “considering options” to continue the project, according to Brittany Prishak, sustainability director for Allegheny County.

Federal efficiency or government ‘plundering?’

In early May, the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, slashed more than $6.4 million in federal funding to local organizations when the EPA terminated the Thriving Communities Grantmaking Program, which was part of the Biden Administration’s Inflation Reduction Act.

On June 11, Lee and Congressman Chris Deluzio, D-Aspinwall, wrote to Zeldin at the EPA in response to ongoing federal funding cuts:

“[DOGE] is plundering our government and dismantling important community-led public and environmental health initiatives, workforce development, and outdoor education programming,” the representatives wrote, while requesting that the EPA restore the grants.

Allegheny Cleanways, a local nonprofit focused on illegal dumpsite remediation, had signed a contract for $224,500 before the EPA canceled the grant. It would have been the single largest influx of funding for the organization, said Executive Director Caily Grube, and would have supported the organization’s land and water cleanups and education programs for two years.

The organization has been hit twice more by federal funding cuts through partnerships with Allegheny County and the City of McKeesport.

When they were approved, “me and my staff were literally dancing,” Grube said. Now, the organization is planning for “fiscal gymnastics.”

On June 18, a federal judge ruled the EPA’s termination of the Thriving Communities grants was unlawful. The EPA is reviewing the decision.

“We’re half assuming it will get axed again,” Grube said.

Across the region, a number of other grants have been canceled by the EPA, including:

$1 million to the City of McKeesport to address environmental issues including air pollution, heat island effects, residential brownfields and stormwater management.

$4.9 million to the Energy Innovation Center Institute to support workforce development in the water utilities.

$15 million to Landforce for workforce development in land stewardship.

More local organizations, including New Sun Rising, the Beaver County Marcellus Awareness Community, 412 Food Rescue and Riverwise, had all been relying on funding from the Thriving Communities Grantmaking Program for projects that improve public health initiatives across the Pittsburgh region, the representatives wrote in their letter.

“This Administration is yet again breaking promises to our region. The EPA has long been a lifeline for so many communities in Pennsylvania. From helping provide clean drinking water, to commerce, to recreation, and more — our prosperity relies on clean and healthy initiatives funded by the EPA.”

,Clean Energy ,2025-07-06 11:32:14+00:00,Los Angeles Times,Contributor: We still rely on gasoline. Why is California adding to the cost and the pollution?,Michael A. Mische,,,,,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2025-07-06/california-gasoline-costs-refineries-pollution-imports,"Despite these realities, California energy policy is leading to the dismantling of the critical infrastructure that supports this essential system.
Stunningly, because that pollution happens over international waters, it doesn’t get counted by the California Air Resources Board.
Closing a refinery in California and importing more fuel causes a net increase in pollution.
Yet we’ve built an energy model that depends on importing foreign oil and, now, a growing dependency on foreign-supplied gasoline.
California will be forced to source more and more fuel from overseas — at greater environmental and economic cost.","California is a state of contradictions. We lead the nation in environmental regulation, tout our clean energy goals with pride and champion a rapid transition away from fossil fuels. Yet despite this green image, our economy — and daily life — still very much run on oil and gas.

Fossil fuels account for roughly 8% of California’s $3 trillion economy — but that’s the first 8%. “If you don’t get that first 8%,” I tell my students, “You don’t get the rest of our economy.” Oil powers everything from trucks to tractors to construction equipment. Without it, you can’t build roads or bridges or get goods to grocery stores. Without refined petroleum products, you don’t make cement, steel, plastics or even the lithium-ion batteries in electric vehicles.

Despite these realities, California energy policy is leading to the dismantling of the critical infrastructure that supports this essential system. Our state has lost more than 30 refineries in the last few decades. We are now down to just nine major gasoline-producing facilities, and two more are scheduled to close in the coming months, Phillips 66 in Los Angeles and Valero in the Bay Area. Those two plants represent 284,000 barrels of daily production and account for nearly 18% of the state’s total refining capacity.

California sits atop one of the largest untapped reserves in the world, the Monterey Shale. But because of policy and regulation, we import most of our oil — including from Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Guyana and Ecuador. California has also imported oil from Russia and Venezuela. Ironically, we have among the world’s cleanest refining standards, but we import fuel from places with lower environmental and labor protections.

All of this is enabled by a supply chain that’s more vulnerable than most realize. We have no major pipelines bringing oil to California. We rely on ships — many from Asia — that take 30 to 40 days to deliver fuel. These foreign tankers pollute at staggering rates. Stunningly, because that pollution happens over international waters, it doesn’t get counted by the California Air Resources Board. Closing a refinery in California and importing more fuel causes a net increase in pollution. And adding to our reliance on foreign oil is risky when global instability is rising.

This isn’t just a self-inflicted energy crisis in the making. It’s also a national security issue.

Military bases in California, Nevada and Arizona depend heavily on in-state refineries for specialized aviation fuel and other petroleum products essential to operations. As refineries shut down, the supply chain narrows, increasing reliance on imports from Asia and elsewhere. These gaps create unacceptable logistical and strategic risks for U.S. military readiness in the western states.

And remember, there are estimated to be hundreds of millions of barrels of accessible oil under our feet. Yet we’ve built an energy model that depends on importing foreign oil and, now, a growing dependency on foreign-supplied gasoline.

This isn’t just unsustainable. It’s also borderline irresponsible.

California’s energy transition is inevitable — but how we get there matters. We can’t pretend fossil fuels are already gone. We still need them for the economy, for mobility, for national security and for the working people who can’t afford a $60,000 electric vehicle or a solar roof.

We have the tools, talent and resources to lead a responsible energy transition, one that leverages our in-state production, balances environmental stewardship with economic pragmatism and protects our most vulnerable communities along the way.

But we have to be honest about where we are. And right now, fossil fuels still power the Golden State.

Especially because of coming refinery rules and a new tax taking effect in July, Californians are set to pay the highest gas prices in the nation. Our prices are inflated by a web of taxes, fees and boutique regulations that has grown thicker and more expensive over time. Even if oil dropped to $0 per barrel and refining were free, Californians would still be paying about $1.82 a gallon at the pump — $1.64 of that from state taxes and fees, plus 18 cents in federal gas tax.

According to CalTrans, Californians drive about 1,200 miles a month. If you’re a working-class Californian and gas goes up 50 cents per gallon, that adds about $500 in annual fuel costs. And because you pay for that with after-tax dollars, you’d need to earn at least an extra $750 just to cover it.

That matters to a construction worker commuting 60 miles a day in a pickup truck. It matters to a single mom cleaning homes across the city or a physical therapist driving to house calls. Most of these people can’t easily trade in their vehicles for Teslas and dodge gasoline hikes. Consumer analysis as noted in CalMatters indicates that the majority of EVs are bought by higher-income Californians living in areas such as Atherton, Palo Alto, Sunnyvale and Mountain View.

The people hit hardest by rising gasoline prices are the ones least able to afford alternatives. For most Californians, there is no viable mass transit available. People are just stuck spending more and more of their income on the gas-powered vehicles their lives depend on. Our state’s policies punish people for not being able to adapt quickly enough to a green future that’s not yet built. It’s a regressive tax masquerading as environmental action.

Until California realistically bridges the gap between aspirational climate goals and equitable policy execution, the state’s lofty environmental vision will continue to rest uneasily on the shoulders of its most vulnerable.

The new state excise tax adding about 2 cents a gallon went into effect July 1, and CARB is pushing for a new low-carbon fuel standard that could add and potentially major costs to the prices of gasoline and diesel fuel. No one knows exactly how much — not even the board proposing the rules.

At a recent Assembly oversight hearing, CARB officials were asked if they analyzed their regulations for consumer impacts. Their answer: We don’t calculate that. The room went silent. It was a stunning admission — regulators pushing policy without running the math.

No wonder we’re seeing an exodus of working families. By layering new and unclear costs on top of an already overstretched system, CARB and other regulators are creating what could become a self-inflicted economic shock.

And for what? Not environmental progress. California will be forced to source more and more fuel from overseas — at greater environmental and economic cost. By relying on polluting sources and carbon-intensive shipping, we’ve simply outsourced our emissions to other countries. California is not reducing emissions. We are exporting them.

If this sounds reckless, it is. But more than that, it’s unjust.

These policies are not burdening the wealthy. They’re crushing the working class. They’re forcing families to choose between gas and groceries, between job access and housing stability. They’re also outsourcing jobs overseas.

And they’re being implemented by unelected bureaucrats who, by their own admission in testimony before California lawmakers, haven’t calculated the real-world impact.

The people of California deserve better than this. They deserve honesty, transparency and policy grounded in economic realism, not ideological fantasy and environmental dogma. If recent and coming changes become a tipping point, it won’t be because of some unpredictable global event. It will be because we chose not to look before we leaped.

The path forward demands a pause, a recalibration and a return to common sense. Otherwise, this summer could mark not just another price hike — but the day we began losing control of our energy future.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b946cf3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2100+0+283/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc9%2F1e%2Fb520c71b46b4b87e9f2f1bbc4bfd%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2222214835,N,,2025-07-06 08:03:21.050177

If the federal government finalizes the budget reconciliation bill in play, pro-consumer voices in Minnesota warn the changes will not be friendly to monthly bills for energy customers.

The analysts pointed to new findings from the nonpartisan think tank Energy Innovation, which looked at provisions in the Senate version from this week. It said the plan would cause Minnesotans' home electricity costs to rise by 28 percent over the next decade.

Annie Levenson-Falk, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board of Minnesota, said it is because Republican lawmakers are poised to eliminate clean energy tax credits while expanding new oil and gas leasing.

""If we can't build as much wind and solar and renewables, then we're not just going to be building more gas plants, but running inefficient, more costly gas plants, more than we would have to,"" Levenson-Falk explained.

Levenson-Falk pointed out many Minnesotans are already struggling with utility costs, and the advancement of cleaner energy sources has prevented things from getting worse. Fossil fuel-linked groups are cheering the proposed measure, including America's Power, which argued incentives for renewables are no longer needed and they are pushing out energy sources such as coal prematurely.

The debates remain at the forefront with energy demand predicted to spike in the coming years. Levenson-Falk noted the new report showed transitioning back to a fossil-fuel vision would lead to a slower rollout of additional power capacity.

""Our power plants are old and they need to be upgraded or replaced,"" Levenson-Falk stressed.

Levenson-Falk acknowledged the need for more power grid upgrades with a diversified energy portfolio. But after up-front construction costs, she added operating solar and wind farms is not as expensive because there is no fuel needed, benefiting ratepayers.

Even with congressional moves potentially stalling progress, she emphasized clean energy would still be a part of the mix as utilities develop their own strategies.",https://kiowacountypress.net/sites/default/files/favicon-512.png,N,,2025-07-06 09:05:32.410001

Both nations have established a joint “Green and Digital Transformation Hub” in Indonesia, which represents a strategic data-based approach to solve shared problems while using their strengths to create an alliance based on sustainable development and global leadership.

The renewable energy portion of Indonesia’s energy mix stands at 14.1 percent during early 2025, while the government maintains a reduced target of 17–20 percent due to funding limitations and technological problems, and infrastructure restrictions. The first implementation phase of the RUPTL 2025–2034 renewable capacity expansion focuses on fossil fuels because green projects face bankability risks, and policy inertia exists. The “Making Indonesia 4.0” initiative emphasizes the immediate requirement to develop digital capabilities among workers, yet vocational training and digital infrastructure development remain behind regional standards. The national targets for decarbonization and industrial value chain progression face risk from these existing deficits.

The German economy possesses top-tier abilities in green technology alongside smart manufacturing and dual vocational training systems. The Fraunhofer Institutes, along with Mittelstand firms, excel in applied research and precision engineering, and Germany has invested more than €200 billion from public and private sources in clean energy and digitalization initiatives since 2020. The German economy decreased by 0.2 percent in 2024, which resulted in a second annual recession, and manufacturing value added decreased by 3 percent because of expensive energy costs and international market competition, and the electric vehicle industry. The economy’s diminishing size demonstrates that gradual changes are insufficient, which leads German industry to search for collaborative platforms to achieve growth through sustainable means.

The proposed Green and Digital Transformation Hub in Indonesia serves to address multiple interconnected challenges. The proposed centralized campus, located within an Indonesian industrial zone, would become possible through combined funding from the German Development Bank (KfW), together with Indonesian state funds and private sector investments. The Hub would perform four essential functions through its establishment. The first function would include German Fraunhofer researchers and Indonesian BRIN scientists operating together at applied R&D centers to develop renewable energy technologies such as tropical solar modules and small-scale pumped storage systems, along with carbon capture projects. The vocational training at the Hub will combine German apprenticeships with Indonesian polytechnic education to train technicians who can install and maintain solar farms and wind turbines, as well as smart manufacturing equipment. The incubator program will enable German cleantech startups to test their innovations in the 270 GW power market of Indonesia and Indonesian digital ventures to connect with German networks and access capital. The Hub would establish a Policy Dialogue Forum to bring together policymakers and regulators who will align Indonesian regulatory standards for feed-in tariffs and land use, and data governance with EU best practices to decrease investment risk and improve project approval speed.

Several challenges must be acknowledged. The construction of green infrastructure in developing markets faces significant financial barriers since the energy transition in Indonesia needs more than $100 billion before 2030, while climate finance commitments remain underutilized. The currency volatility and policy changes demonstrated through the 2025 target revision reduce investor trust in emerging markets. German vocational training methods need to be adapted to match Indonesian academic traditions through joint curriculum development and credential recognition systems. The process of achieving coordination among different government entities, along with private organizations and agencies, faces possible delays from bureaucratic procedures. Environmental and social considerations, including community land rights and ecological sensitivities in island provinces, need established stakeholder engagement protocols to prevent new challenges from arising.

A steering board with senior foreign ministry officials as chairs would lead the Hub’s governance model, while technical committees composed of energy ministry representatives alongside industry ministry representatives and education ministry representatives, and finance ministry representatives would provide support. A transparent monitoring system that uses benchmarked indicators such as renewable megawatt deployment and the number of graduated apprentices, patented technologies, and regulatory changes would maintain accountability. The implementation of public–private dialogue platforms with civil society advisory panels would incorporate local views, while an integrated communication strategy using social media, along with biannual progress reports, would increase public support.

The Green and Digital Transformation Hub provides Indonesia with a proven method to reach its 2025 targets by lowering coal electricity usage below 50 percent while boosting manufacturing export growth by 15 percent per year. The Hub provides Germany with a strategic opportunity to transfer its cleantech expertise and rebuild its manufacturing sector while establishing an example for international climate partnership models. This initiative establishes a strategic alliance through infrastructure development, coordination with human capital investment and technology incubation, and policy harmonization, which creates mutual accountability and shared innovation between the two nations for a low-carbon, digitally empowered future.

Farmers are able to apply for the state conservation funds through their local soil and water conservation districts.","RICHMOND — Despite funding cuts across the board for programs and agencies on the federal level, Virginia farmers are seeing a win for conservation projects. The state is showing a dedication to sustainable farming measures by allocating $223 million for agricultural practices that stop pollutants and sediment disturbances that lead to runoff into the Chesapeake Bay.

It is a $16 million increase over the last fiscal year, leading to the fourth year of increasing funding from the state. The program helps farmers in the commonwealth to implement projects that conserve water, help soil health through cover crops, and other sustainability goals. It is part of a larger, multistate effort to improve the water quality of the Chesapeake Bay.

“This unprecedented funding underscores Virginia’s strong commitment to environmental stewardship and agricultural resilience,” said Secretary of Natural and Historic Resources Stefanie Taillon in a statement. “Investing in voluntary conservation practices is one of the most effective ways we can protect our waterways, support farmers and meet our Chesapeake Bay restoration goals.”

Farmers can apply for up to $300,000 in fiscal year 2026 to cost-share one of over 60 projects, including stream cattle exclusion zones, cover crops, and animal waste control facilities.

“So sometimes they would be implementing a practice, but this is kind of taking their practice to the next level from a work party perspective, and the payment structure is set up in a way to try and incentivize or offset the financial disadvantage of implementing rye over a legume for example,” said James Martin, Director of the Department of Conservation and Recreation’s division of soil and water conservation. Rye is less attractive to farmers as a cover crop because it spreads into other crops.

Martin said it is important to bring farmers to the table on these goals because they understand it is a cost to them to implement these projects. He said he has been pleased with the General Assembly’s investment in cleaning up the Chesapeake Bay.

“If we fail to meet our agricultural commitments in the Chesapeake Bay by 2027 there’s a possibility that the secretaries of agriculture and the secretaries of natural resources would mandate the implementation of nutrient management on crops,” Martin said.

Over a decade ago, Virginia joined other states in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed agreement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Later, the General Assembly implemented a law that beefed up the requirements for the state to reduce its amount of pollutants running out of its waterways into the Bay.

There are questions around how the agreement will be impacted with the Trump administration proposing major cuts to the EPA. After a brief funding pause, many of the dollars already allocated by Congress were released to the Bay cleanup programs. It is uncertain what the budget for the projects will be in the next year.

Even in watered-down, twisted-out form, Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill made for yet one more.","As I write this, House Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries is talking ... and talking ... and talking, using his Cory Booker moment to stall the final passage of President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Act.

He may be helping its passage. Vice President JD Vance said one GOP Congressman just texted him, “I was undecided on the bill but then I watched Hakeem Jeffries performance and now I’m a firm yes.”

But as of my deadline, which was early last week so Gazette staff could have Friday off to celebrate (the real) No Kings Day, I can’t confirm the BBB’s passage. As I type, Jeffries is still using his “magic minute,” a customary privilege of party leaders to speak for as long as they wish.

Trump racks up wins

But as I file this column, I can confirm President Donald Trump is hours away from his scheduled rally at the Iowa State Fairgrounds. He’ll surely talk about his victories of late, and he’s got a bucketful from just the last two weeks: Bunker-busting kabooms that impaled Iran’s nuclear capabilities, high praise from the NATO secretary-general for convincing most members to up their defense spending and a fistful of favorable Supreme Court rulings.

Ope, there’s more: new trade deals, a stock market that has roared back from tariff panic, gas prices back at 2021 levels right before a big summer travel weekend, zero illegal migrants released into the country for a second month in a row and a jobs report that that beat expectations for the third month in a row.

Also, he’s kicking off a yearlong celebration to mark the 250th year of the greatest country in the history of the world.

And yes, he’ll probably boast his big, beautiful win in getting the Big Beautiful Bill passed, even if it hasn’t happened by the time he steps on that stage.

By the time you read this, the Big Beautiful Bill will likely have passed. It needed to. Without it, the income tax cuts we have all enjoyed for the last eight years — whether some admit or even realize it — would vanish. Our taxes would have gone up collectively by trillions of dollars, stifling the economy and likely triggering a recession. No one has ever raised taxes and watched an economic boom follow.

Bill is a necessary mess

Don’t get me wrong, there are plenty of things about the Big Beautiful Bill I dislike. I don’t like that only eight years after the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act capped state and local tax (SALT) deductions at $10,000, the BBB raises that cap to $40,000. That will enable high-tax states and metropolitan areas to keep their taxes high — or raise them even higher if up to $30,000 of that tax burden can once again be deducted from their residents’ federal taxes. We Iowans didn’t set fiscally sane tax rates just to see Californians’ federal obligations offset by their own tax-and-spend stupidity.

But should a SALT cap raise — or a host of similar bugaboos — be a dealbreaker for the passage of the Big Beautiful Bill? No. Even worse than all that would be if our taxes shoot up and the economy sputters, not to mention a number of other unfortunate side effects.

The $10,000 SALT cap added to the 2017 tax cut bill cost the bill 12 GOP congressional votes, all from Republicans in high-tax blue states. At the time, House Republicans had a 45-seat advantage over Democrats and could afford to lose those votes. In the current Congress, House Republicans could only lose three from their own party and still get the bill passed. (In a strategy move that surprises absolutely no one, Democrats in both chambers were united in opposition.)

So they had to negotiate. They had to compromise and give just enough members just enough of what they wanted, including a whole load of stuff that plenty of people don’t like.

Politicians wield power to serve interests

Don’t go assuming that is unusual. It’s what politicians do. They leverage their influence hoping to serve the interests of themselves and their constituents.

Rep. Nick LaLota, R-N.Y., for example, said he couldn’t get behind the Senate version of the Big Beautiful Bill, which hikes the SALT cap increase to $40,000 but drops it back to $10,000 in the year 2030.

""I need $40K for my constituents, and it has to be $40K forever,” LaLota told Axios on June 30.

I, as an Iowan, having stated my dislike for large SALT deductions, certainly don’t like that. But I understand it. If I hated myself enough to live and pay taxes in New York, I’d probably favor LaLota’s leveraging for a higher SALT deduction cap. (How LaLota voted in the end is something we’ll find out past my deadline.)

That’s the standard in all deliberative bodies — members wield their power and leaders let them to the extent that they must in order to accomplish the overall goal.

Politicians flex

Look at what happened in the Iowa Legislature not two months ago. A group of 12 state senators pledged to not vote on the required state budget unless legislation prohibiting eminent domain for private companies was brought up for a vote. Those 12 senators leveraged their collective power for the sake of the interests of constituent landowners and their environmentalist allies who were adamantly opposed to their land being seized by a carbon capture and storage company for a pipeline. The leverage worked -- the eminent domain bill passed, as did the state budget, and everyone got to go home.

Yes, the anti-pipeline bill was vetoed by Gov. Kim Reynolds, opening a tiny window at the end of a still-unlikely tunnel for Summit Carbon Solutions’ and ethanol leaders’ hopes to construct a carbon pipeline in Iowa.

But Reynolds and legislators who had opposed the eminent domain bill were acting on behalf of constituents, too, and their interests: avoiding the unintended blocking of future, desirable projects. It’s nothing to do with keeping the former employers of one particular state senator with gubernatorial aspirations happy and their checkbooks wide-open. (Depending on whom you ask, at least.)

While we’re on the subject, one thing that helps make the carbon pipeline industry especially lucrative is tax credits — specifically, the 45Q tax credits that offer between $85 and $180 per ton, depending on the method of capture. If Summit captures 18 million tons of carbon annually as they claim is their plan, that adds up to between $1.5 billion and $3.2 billion in incentives. Ka-ching.

Everyone loves spending bills when they suit

Democrats in Washington, D.C., and their supporters decry those tax credits as part of the bill’s big, beautiful giveaway to corporations and the wealthy. But they certainly didn’t object to those same handouts when passing former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, which increased the values of those very 45Q tax credits to their present amounts. (And increased the deficit and raised the national debt, but those were minor details, apparently.)

That’s why their arguments fall flat. The game they loathe is the same game they love when their people hold the gavel and the pen.

They condemn Republicans for trying to prevent trillions in tax increases, claiming it will increase the deficit and national debt. (Economic growth from BBB complicates their gloomy forecast.) But when Republicans try to cut a tiny fraction of spending, and they go ballistic and claim people will die.

Big corporations shouldn’t get tax giveaways, they insist. But Congress must protect these tax credits for things like renewable energy upgrades (from which big corporations will profit.)

OK, then.

That’s why there’s always so much to spending bills, “big and beautiful” or not. Everyone has their own interests. The federal government is an enticing machine for serving those interests.

Bob’s interest is in passing the bill so his taxes don’t go up. Carl’s interest is seeing it fail so the wealthy pay more (even though Bob will, too.)

Roger wants to keep residential solar tax credits alive so he can install panels on his roof. Denise is a server at a restaurant who wants tips to become tax-exempt. Jared desires his overtime pay not to be taxed so he can still take more home even after it bumped him into a higher tax bracket.

Our legislators are the ones trying to represent all those interests while compromising with colleagues representing other, often competing ones. It’s a process.

Some GOP holdouts demanded “perfect“ at the expense of ”good.“ In representative government, there’s no such thing. Especially when the constituency is so polarized and when looming consequences include a big tax increase.

Democrats continue down their road to nowhere

Unfortunately, the Democrat left doesn’t even want for perfect to be the enemy of good. They want to make Trump the enemy of everything. They’re failing at doing so.

Polls show their base is getting accustomed to failure. A record number of Republican voters, on the other hand, are stoked at all this winning. Even in watered-down, twisted-out form, Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill made for yet one more.

Whenever it actually passed, that is. As I turn this in, Minority Leader Jeffries is still talking.

Encouragingly, a growing number of Republican members of Congress are vocalizing their support for the clean energy tax credits.","The House passed a bill cutting clean energy tax credits, impacting potential Indiana economic growth.

These cuts could increase energy costs, pollution, and threaten investments in clean energy projects.

Indiana has already benefited from clean energy tax credits, with significant investments and job creation in electric vehicle and carbon capture projects.

On May 22, the House of Representatives voted to pass a budget bill that drastically cuts America’s clean energy tax credits. I’m grateful that Rep. Erin Houchin was one of 21 representatives who signed a letter in support of clean energy tax credits but disappointed that the House advanced this legislation without these credits.

These cuts will hurt Indiana if they go on to become law. Experts are already warning that these changes would raise energy costs for American households, increase pollution and threaten growing economic investments we’ve seen in Indiana.

Federal tax credits — designed to boost clean energy manufacturing in the U.S. — have been working for us locally and around the country. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, our district, Indiana’s 9th, has benefited in at least three ways:

Columbus got $100 million in investments that helped create 1883 jobs at Toyota to build electric vehicles. Bedford got $45 million in investments for making electric vehicles at GM. And Mitchell got $991 million in investments for carbon capture and storage in cement making at Heidelberg Materials and Mitsubishi.

This legislation has overwhelmingly benefited Republican-held districts — 78% of the funding has gone to rural and suburban areas held by the GOP. But that success story could unravel quickly. The legislation is now in the Senate’s hands, and the House passage has set them on a path toward drastic cuts.

Trump administration proposals to repeal federal policies and freeze funding have cost America nearly 42,000 announced jobs — including 1,600 in Indiana — and stopped more than 60 announced clean energy projects representing more than $57 billion in investment.

If the cuts become law, energy prices will rise. Households and local businesses will take a huge hit. A rollback of tax credits for home energy upgrades like rooftop solar is a blow to Indiana residents, who’ve been using these tools to cut energy bills. Incentives have made it easier for homeowners to install solar panels and save money. They have also helped stabilize America’s power grid. But those benefits — and the local businesses that depend on them — are in jeopardy if Congress moves forward with these cuts.

On the other hand, if Congress protects clean energy tax credits, it would be a huge boost to Indiana’s economy over the next decade. Analysis by American Clean Power and ICF estimates that continuing clean energy incentives will add 524,000 jobs in Indiana and boost Hoosiers’ income by $37 billion. That’s not hypothetical — that’s real money and real livelihoods.

Encouragingly, a growing number of Republican members of Congress are vocalizing their support for the clean energy tax credits. Four Republican senators sent a letter to leadership last month saying repeal would “lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader.”

Clean energy tax credits are beneficial for Indiana! Undoing them now — as the House just voted to do — would be reckless and harmful. Please join me in urging Sens. Todd Young and Jim Banks to work with their colleagues in the Senate to protect these tax credits. Email them through their websites or call them at (202) 224-3121.

He further added that various procedural complications and delays in the implementation of net metering give a bad signal to those who want to install such systems.

""We strongly demand that solar panels and other products be exempted from 7.5% VAT and the unreasonable customs valuation system which discourages the potential investors in this sector,"" said Mostafa Al Mahmud.

He also said, ""It is necessary to develop a timely monitoring and support framework to maintain the professionalism and responsibility of customs officials in the import process, so that no party is subjected to unwanted harassment.""

According to iVT, Oxa, the brains behind autonomous driving software, has teamed up with Bradshaw EV, a trusted manufacturer and supplier of industrial electric vehicles. The two companies are launching a new wave of driverless electric vehicles. Designed to optimize operations in factories, airports, and solar farms, the EVs are already fully equipped and ready to go.

The Oxa-Bradshaw collaboration is starting with two autonomous vehicles: the Bradshaw T800 tow tractor and the Club Car Carryall 500 utility vehicle. Both come fitted with the advanced Oxa Driver self-driving software and are built for real-world industrial work.

The Bradshaw T800 has an eight-ton towing capability for off-highway light logistics applications. It can move autonomously across massive warehouse floors, distribution centers, campuses, airports, and other sites. Meanwhile, the Carryall 500 is designed for autonomous asset monitoring and data collection. It is fully equipped for use in industrial plants, solar farms, and other large environments.

These driverless EVs also don't just move cargo or collect data; they free human workers from repetitive or hazardous jobs, reduce operating costs, and help companies accomplish more without burning more fuel, making them smart and cost-efficient.

Their built-in inductive charging and rugged off-highway design allow them to run longer, cleaner, and with far less maintenance than traditional vehicles powered by internal combustion engines.

With the industrial sector contributing more than 3 billion tons of heat-trapping gases each year, innovations like driverless EVs can help slash this huge number. By replacing gas-powered fleets with clean, autonomous electric vehicles, industries reduce air and noise pollution as well as energy and health costs.

Oxa CEO Gavin Jackson, per iTV, called the partnership a major step toward ""safe, reliable self-driving solutions."" Together, Oxa and Bradshaw aim to deliver mobility automation that provides real productivity gains for industries that need them most.

This project aligns with a broader effort to make transportation cleaner and smarter across all sectors. One company in Dubai is pushing the freight transport revolution with a fleet of self-driving electric trucks. Hesai and Westwell have collaborated to develop all-electric trucks for more efficient logistics in ports and cargo terminals. Even Apple is contributing to the shift with its efforts to develop self-driving cars.

As more sectors adopt automation, innovations like the Oxa-Bradshaw EVs signal a shift in logistics operations and how industries can lower their negative impact on the environment.

Eskasoni Cold Logistics stores frozen, cold and dry goods, which can include anything from satellite dishes to blueberries, but the bulk of its storage is frozen fish products.

Thanks to the recent addition of more than 1,300 ground-mounted solar panels through a government-funded solar energy initiative, up to 40 per cent of the facility's energy use is offset by solar power. The project was celebrated with a ceremonial ribbon cutting on June 23.

""The fact that we're just using natural sunlight to drive power is a good thing,"" said co-owner Jim Gillis.

Gillis and his brother Allan purchased the facility in 2017 in partnership with the Eskasoni First Nation. Steve Parsons, the CEO of Eskasoni's corporate division and the lead on the community's renewable energy efforts, says the project resulted from another partnership between Eskasoni and Natural Forces Solar, an independent renewable energy power producer in Halifax.

That partnership qualified the storage facility for the solar panel installation under the province's Green Choice Program, which aims to help large-scale electricity customers transition to clean energy.

According to Eskasoni's corporate division, the 583-kilowatt solar system was the result of a $1.85-million investment, with $1.1 million from Housing, Infrastructure and Communities Canada, $570,000 from Eskasoni, $128,000 from the province and $72,000 from Efficiency Nova Scotia.

Parsons said the facility can store up to 2.3 million kilograms of frozen fish products, which requires a constant temperature of about –23 C. The facility also provides live lobster storage and can hold up to 113,000 kilograms at once. The lobsters require a constant filtered water flow at about 3 C to remain dormant.

Parsons said the cost to run those systems adds up, so the solar energy project will make a big difference on the monthly bill.

""Based on the estimates and our typical, average sun patterns, we should be able to save 35 to 40 per cent on an ongoing, consistent basis,"" he said.

That represents about $8,000 a month, Parsons said, noting the project has created jobs in the community as well, with 10 band members trained as certified installers of solar ground-mount systems.

Gillis, who is also general manager of Live Stor Sydney, which operates out of the facility, said the solar system was only brought online a few months ago, but it's already making a difference on the power bill and the building's efficiency.

The facility still relies on Nova Scotia Power for at least 60 per cent of its energy consumption, but Parsons said he hopes there will be more clean energy opportunities for the facility in the future.

The Bottom Line: Act Now or Pay Later The Texas floods are a harbinger of disasters to come.","The catastrophic floods that ravaged Texas's Hill Country in July 2025 were a stark wake-up call. With rainfall exceeding 12 inches per hour, the Guadalupe River surged to 39 feet—its highest recorded level—submerging neighborhoods, destroying infrastructure, and claiming over 24 lives. The disaster underscored a grim reality: America's aging infrastructure is catastrophically unprepared for climate-driven disasters. For investors, this crisis is a call to action—one that demands capital be directed toward building a more resilient future. Here's how to profit from the urgent need to fortify communities against floods, storms, and rising temperatures.

The Texas Floods: A Blueprint for Vulnerabilities

The floods exposed three critical weaknesses:

1. Grid Insecurity: Over 2,600 households lost power as aging transmission lines failed under floodwaters.

2. Drainage Failure: Outdated systems were overwhelmed, turning urban areas into lakes.

3. Early Warning Deficiencies: A failed river gauge left officials blind to the crisis.

These failures cost Texas over $10 billion in damages—and that's just the start. The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) gave Texas a “C” for infrastructure in 2025, citing systemic underinvestment in energy systems, transit, and flood mitigation. With climate change intensifying extreme weather, these vulnerabilities are no longer theoretical risks but present-day realities.

The Climate Resilience Investment Opportunity

The urgency to rebuild better—and smarter—is creating multi-billion-dollar markets. Here are the sectors to watch:

1. Grid Hardening & Smart Energy Systems

The Texas floods revealed how fragile energy grids are to climate shocks. Outdated power lines and substations failed catastrophically, leaving communities in darkness. Solutions are already in motion:

- Entergy Texas's $137M Grid Resilience Plan: Burying power lines and fortifying substations to withstand floods and wildfires.

- Microgrids and Distributed Energy: Companies like Tesla and NextEra Energy are leading the shift to decentralized systems that can operate independently during outages.

Investment Play:

- Stocks: Consider utility companies with grid modernization pipelines, such as NextEra Energy (NEE) or Dominion Energy (D).

- ETFs: The iShares Global Infrastructure ETF (IGF) offers diversified exposure to energy and utility projects.

2. Flood Mitigation Infrastructure

Texas's drainage systems were overwhelmed by rainfall that exceeded their design capacity. The solution lies in “gray” and “green” infrastructure:

- Gray Infrastructure: Levees, dams, and storm surge barriers. The $31 billion Ike Dike project aims to protect Texas's coast from hurricanes, but similar projects are needed inland.

- Green Infrastructure: Wetland restoration, permeable pavements, and AI-optimized rain gardens. Firms like AECOM and Tetra Tech are pioneers in these solutions.

Investment Play:

- Stocks: AECOM (ACM) and Jacobs Engineering (JEC) are engineering giants with flood resilience expertise.

- Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs): Look for municipal bonds funding projects like Harris County's $2.5 billion flood control plan.

3. Predictive Analytics & Emergency Tech

The failed Guadalupe River gauge was a life-threatening oversight. New technologies are filling this gap:

- AI-Driven Early Warning Systems: IBM's Weather Company uses predictive analytics to model flood risks in real time.

- Drones & Satellite Surveillance: DJI and American Robotics deploy drones to assess damage and map flood zones faster than ever.

Investment Play:

- Stocks: IBM (IBM) and NVIDIA (NVDA) are leaders in AI and data infrastructure.

- ETFs: The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Communication Services ETF (XLO) includes tech firms advancing emergency comms.

4. Parametric Insurance & Climate Finance

Traditional insurance models are buckling under climate costs. Parametric policies—triggered by measurable events like rainfall thresholds—are rising to meet demand. Swiss Re and Munich Re are pioneers, but startups like FloodFlash are democratizing access.

Investment Play:

- ETFs: The SPDR S&P Insurance ETF (KIE) includes firms innovating in climate insurance.

- Green Bonds: Municipal bonds for flood mitigation projects offer tax-free yields while funding resilience.

Risks and Considerations

Regulatory Delays: Permitting infrastructure projects can take years.

Cost Overruns: Texas's history of 20–30% cost overruns on projects demands due diligence.

Tech Consolidation: Early-stage firms may be acquired, limiting upside for equity holders.

The Bottom Line: Act Now or Pay Later

The Texas floods are a harbinger of disasters to come. The ASCE estimates $5 trillion is needed to modernize U.S. infrastructure by 2029—a timeline shrinking as storms grow fiercer. Investors ignoring this trend risk being left behind.

Actionable Strategy:

- Allocate 30% to grid hardening (utilities, smart energy tech).

- Deploy 40% to flood mitigation (infrastructure firms, green bonds).

- Reserve 30% for emergency tech and insurance (AI, parametric policies).

The time to invest in climate resilience is now. Those who build defenses against today's floods will profit from tomorrow's safer, smarter world.

Ethanol saves every American family money at the pump and helps build a more resilient, self-reliant energy future.","The following editorial is by Erik Huschitt, President of WBFA.

As Americans prepare to celebrate our nation’s independence this Fourth of July, a new report

offers a timely reminder. American-made ethanol is helping us move toward greater energy

independence while saving consumers billions of dollars at the pump.

A recent analysis by energy expert George Hoekstra finds that ethanol use results in more than

$50 billion in annual fuel savings for American drivers. That is equivalent to about 39 cents per

gallon. You’re saving nearly 40 cents per gallon every time you fill up thanks to ethanol, without

sacrificing your engine or reliability.

How? Ethanol is a high-octane, low-cost fuel component blended into nearly every gallon of

gasoline sold today. Hoekstra’s study shows that producing the same octane level using only

traditional petroleum refining methods would be more than four times as expensive as using

ethanol. Eliminating ethanol from the U.S. fuel mix would significantly increase refining costs,

driving up fuel prices nationwide.

Consequently, for drivers in Wisconsin and across the country, that savings is real and meaningful. Blending American-grown ethanol into our fuel is one of the most effective strategies we have to shield

consumers from global energy market disruptions. Renewable fuels strengthen U.S. energy

security at critical moments. Wisconsin’s biofuels industry plays a direct role in delivering

that protection. The state’s farmers grow the corn. Our producers convert it into clean-burning fuel. Our

communities benefit through lower fuel costs, job creation, capital investment, and increased

local tax revenue.

Wisconsin is home to nine ethanol plants. The plants grind 32% of the 545 million bushels of corn

produced in our state each year. This generates approximately 670 million gallons of ethanol

annually. These facilities are a cornerstone of our state’s agricultural economy, supporting both

rural vitality and national energy goals.

Furthermore, the benefits don’t stop at the 10% ethanol blend (E10) that’s now standard nationwide.

Hoekstra’s research also indicates that higher ethanol blends, such as E15 (Unleaded 88), can yield even greater savings per gallon for consumers. These fuels are already expanding across

Wisconsin and the country. By supporting policies that enable year-round sales of higher

ethanol blends and investing in retail infrastructure, we can unlock even more value for

American families.

Ethanol is a national asset economically, environmentally, and strategically. As we honor our

country’s independence this week, let’s also recognize the role renewable fuels play in

preserving it. Ethanol saves every American family money at the pump and helps build a more

resilient, self-reliant energy future.",https://www.q106.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/gas-pump-e1669988266460-300x182-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-06 09:05:46.376778

More wind and solar on the electric grid helps keep utility bills lower, and Biden-era tax credits would have ramped up those projects.

And if the EPA wanted to take the money back, there's a different process the agency would need to follow.

Capito said previously the bill intended to rescind billions in funding that had been frozen.","WASHINGTON -- The sprawling tax and policy bill that passed Congress repeals a multibillion-dollar green bank for financing climate-friendly projects, and the Trump administration should be allowed to freeze its funding and cancel related contracts with nonprofits, federal officials said in a court filing.

Climate United Fund and other nonprofits in March sued the Environmental Protection Agency, its administrator Lee Zeldin and Citibank, which held the program's money. The lawsuit argued the defendants had illegally denied the groups access to billions awarded last year through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, commonly referred to as a ""green bank."" The program was created by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

But the bill that passed Congress on Thursday would repeal the part of the 2022 law that established the green bank and rescind money that hadn't already been obligated to its recipients.

The EPA said the bill should hand it a victory in its court fight that is being heard by a federal appeals court in Washington. Now that Congress has rescinded funding, an earlier federal judge's decision forcing the EPA to release money to the groups should be reversed, the agency said in its Thursday court filing.

Climate United Fund disagrees. It acknowledges that the bill in Congress is a ""significant policy setback"" but argues that most of the money had been disbursed and is unaffected by the bill. And if the EPA wanted to take the money back, there's a different process the agency would need to follow.

""Our funds have already been obligated and disbursed. Any effort to claim otherwise is simply a lie to justify illegal attempts to claw back funds intended to benefit communities across the country,"" CEO Beth Bafford said in a statement.

The Congressional Budget Office estimated repealing the program would save just $19 million, which is in line with its administrative expenses only, indicating the bill doesn't touch the multibillion-dollar grant awards, according to Lauren Tsuboyama, spokesperson for the Power Forward Communities coalition, which received a green bank award.

According to the EPA, when the agency terminated the grants the funds ""became unobligated.""

""Grantees have desperately performed legal gymnastics to hold tens of billions of taxpayer dollars hostage. In the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill, Congress made their intent crystal clear in repealing the program entirely and returning those billions in unobligated funds to the U.S. Treasury,"" EPA spokesperson Brigit Hirsch said in a statement.

The green bank's goals run counter to the Trump administration's opposition to policies that address climate change and its embrace of fossil fuels. Zeldin quickly made the bank a target, characterizing the $20 billion in grants as a scheme marred by conflicts of interest and potential fraud.

In February, Zeldin told Fox News that he suspected the green bank ""was a clear cut case of waste and abuse"" that ""in my opinion, is criminal."" The following month, Zeldin terminated the grants.

U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan has previously said that when the federal government was asked for evidence of fraud, the agency didn't provide it and shifted its position. Chutkan, who was nominated by former President Barack Obama, decided the government can't terminate the contracts and that the groups should have access to some of their frozen money.

That order was put on hold during the EPA's appeal.

The agency argues the nonprofits are making constitutional and statutory arguments that don't apply in what it sees as a simple contract fight.

If the government successfully argues the case is a contract dispute, then the EPA says it should be heard by a different court that can only award a lump sum -- not force the government to keep the grants in place. Federal officials argue there is no law or provision in the Constitution that compels the EPA to make these grants to these groups.

In its court filing, the EPA also pointed to comments by Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, chair of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, as supportive of the agency's position.

Musk's bid to dismantle the ""Porky Pig Party"" and prioritize fiscal discipline while defending his tech and energy interests creates a volatile policy landscape. For investors, this is not merely a political spectacle but a critical lens through which to reassess exposures in tech monopolies, renewable energy, and infrastructure. Let's dissect the risks and opportunities.

The Fiscal Crossroads: EV Subsidies vs. Debt Reduction

At the heart of Musk's agenda is a paradox: preserving subsidies for his core industries (EVs, space tech) while slashing the national debt. The $7,500 EV tax credit—a lifeline for Tesla—faces existential threats from fiscal conservatives. Musk's proposed ""sensible wind-down"" of subsidies clashes with deficit hawks aiming to eliminate them entirely by 2025.

Tesla (TSLA) has historically faltered during subsidy debates. In 2023, rumors of tax credit cuts triggered a 25% drop in its stock. Today, the stakes are higher: losing the credit could cost Tesla $1.2 billion annually, ceding ground to Chinese rivals like BYD. Investors must ask: Can Musk's political clout shield Tesla, or will fiscal austerity prevail?

Energy Sector: Fossil Fuel Fights vs. EV Infrastructure Resilience

While Musk's party pushes EV subsidies, the executive order ""Unleashing American Energy"" (Jan 2025) prioritizes fossil fuels, mandating expanded oil/gas production and scrapping EV mandates. This creates a split:

- Traditional Energy: Firms like Peabody Energy (BTU) may see subsidy cuts, but natural gas utilities (e.g., Dominion Energy (D)) could thrive as a ""bridge fuel.""

- EV Infrastructure: ChargePoint (CHPT) and Tesla's Supercharger network are shielded by $4B in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) funds, making them safer bets than Tesla itself.

Historically, CHPT outperforms TSLA during subsidy volatility (+14.57% vs. -25.46% over 60 days). This suggests a tactical shift: short TSLA while long CHPT to hedge against policy whiplash.

Infrastructure & Space Tech: Bipartisan Goldmines

Musk's focus on fiscal austerity may backfire in one arena: infrastructure. The BIL's $4B for EV charging and bipartisan support for space colonization (e.g., NASA's $12B SpaceX contracts) create rare consensus.

Aerospace: Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Maxar Technologies (MAXR) stand to benefit from space tech and defense projects, insulated from partisan squabbles.

Renewables: NextEra Energy (NEE) gains from bipartisan infrastructure spending, even as Musk's party negotiates EV subsidy terms.

Political Realities: Can the America Party Deliver?

The party's survival hinges on overcoming state ballot access hurdles (e.g., California's 75,000-member threshold) and FEC contribution limits ($10k/year per state chapter). Legal challenges from existing parties could delay its influence until 2026. For now, the ""swing bloc"" strategy—targeting 2-3 Senate seats—may yield limited legislative sway.

Investment Playbook for Volatility

Short Tesla (TSLA) while long ChargePoint (CHPT) to exploit subsidy policy swings.

Rotate capital from fossil fuels to clean energy plays like NEE, benefiting from infrastructure spending.

Overweight aerospace stocks (LMT, MAXR) for space tech's bipartisan appeal.

Conclusion: A High-Risk, High-Return Policy Landscape

Musk's America Party has injected unpredictability into sectors tied to his interests. EVs face subsidy risks, while infrastructure and space tech offer relative safety. Investors must balance exposure to Musk's core industries with defensive positions—until the political smoke clears. As the old adage goes: Beware the man who wants to save the world… he might just disrupt it first.

I thought buying a Kia meant shipping jobs overseas, but in a twist that’s setting Reddit and Facebook comment sections on fire, the 2025 Kia EV6 ranked sixth on the American-Made Index. Turns out, the EV6 was built in Georgia and packed with more American-made parts than most Chevys. Meanwhile, some “American” cars are assembled overseas with imported parts.

For the first time, six of the top ten vehicles in the 2025 American-Made Index (AMI) are electric, signaling a major shift in domestic EV production. The AMI, compiled annually by Cars.com, ranks vehicles by how much of their content and labor is sourced from the United States. In 2025, the Tesla Model 3, Model Y, Model X, and Model S claimed the top four spots. The Kia EV6 ranked sixth, and the Volkswagen ID.4 came in tenth. Other EVs on the broader list include the Ford F-150 Lightning (22nd place), Hyundai Ioniq 5 (30th place), and the Kia EV9 (67th place). The surge in electric models reflects deeper integration of EV manufacturing into the U.S. auto economy. This year, 11 battery-electric models qualified, up from just eight last year, with another 19 hybrids and plug-in hybrids also making the list. The top 10 models show that EVs are not only here to stay but are being made closer to home.

This has led to a lot of social media buzz about which EVs made the list and the implications for “buying American.” Here’s a recent post on Reddit by black88mx6 about why the 2025 EV6 made the top ten.

“The battery on the EV6 is manufactured here in the USA and is one of the reasons for the delay for the new 2025 model. This is reflected in the 80% USA/Canada content 2025 EV6 percentage vs 20% USA/Canada for the 2025 Ioniq 5's up to VIN 10,000.”

detox4you responded with:

“Building batteries in the USA will become difficult if China keeps blocking exporting materials needed.”

black88mx6 added:

“Materials will be sourced from elsewhere, just not for the same cost.”

The American-Made Index (AMI) is important because it provides transparency into how much of a vehicle’s content and labor is sourced from the United States. This helps consumers make informed choices that align with their economic, patriotic, or sustainability values. The AMI has taken on more importance as supply chain concerns, tariffs, and geopolitical tensions affect global trade. Consumers are increasingly interested in buying vehicles that support American jobs and reduce reliance on foreign production. The AMI helps spotlight automakers that have invested in U.S. manufacturing, like Tesla, Kia, and Volkswagen. It also underscores contradictions, as some traditionally “foreign” brands may build more American-made cars than legacy U.S. brands.

The American-Made Index ranks vehicles using five key factors: location of final assembly, percentage of U.S. and Canadian parts, origin of available engines and transmissions, and U.S. manufacturing workforce. With growing awareness of economic nationalism and supply chain reliability, these criteria matter more than ever to both consumers and analysts. This year’s rankings reflect a shift toward valuing domestic content and job creation. For example, the Kia EV6 surprised many by ranking sixth due to its assembly at the West Point, Georgia plant and its impressive 80 percent U.S. and Canadian parts content, the highest of any vehicle sold in the country. Cars.com emphasized that transparency around where cars are made is increasingly important as buyers weigh their purchasing decisions. In a year marked by global instability and trade tensions, the index has become more than just a technical measure, it’s now a key signal of economic and industrial alignment.

Tariffs and Policy Changes Drive Consumer Behavior, plus Affordability and Incentive Concerns

The new 25 percent tariffs on foreign-built vehicles and imported auto parts have amplified consumer interest in domestically produced cars. These import taxes, introduced under the Trump administration, are expected to raise car prices by several thousand dollars and create pressure on affordability, especially for lower-priced models. According to Cars.com, vehicles priced below $30,000 are mostly imported, and only two such vehicles are made in the U.S. Political dynamics are also shifting. While the Biden administration backed EV adoption with tax credits and infrastructure investment, a Republican-led rollback is gaining momentum. The House has already passed a bill to end the $7,500 EV tax credit, and the Senate is now considering it. Former President Trump has vocally criticized EV incentives and distanced himself from Tesla CEO Elon Musk. These developments create an unpredictable policy environment for both automakers and consumers and could slow the momentum of U.S.-based EV production and adoption.

Rising vehicle prices and the potential loss of federal tax incentives are fueling concerns about EV affordability. The $7,500 federal tax credit, which helped offset EV costs for many buyers, is now under threat in Congress. Without it, the barrier to EV ownership could grow, especially for first-time or budget-conscious buyers. Analysts note that most EVs priced under $30,000 are imported and may become even more expensive with new tariffs. Cars.com data shows that among 18 sub-$30K vehicles, only two are made in the United States. While a majority of surveyed shoppers say they are willing to pay more for American-made cars if it means supporting U.S. jobs, that sentiment may not translate into action for buyers seeking affordability. Automakers now face the dual challenge of keeping costs down while building vehicles domestically. Without incentives, the industry could struggle to meet its electrification goals, especially among mainstream consumers.

Tesla continues to dominate the American-Made Index, a position it has held for several years. For 2025, Tesla vehicles take the top four spots, led by the Model 3 at number one, followed by the Model Y, Model X, and Model S. These results reflect the company's vertical integration and localized production strategy. All of Tesla’s light-duty passenger vehicles are assembled in California or Texas, boosting their rankings based on U.S.-based labor and parts content. Tesla’s consistent lead in the AMI highlights the company’s investment in domestic supply chains and workforce. Its manufacturing model gives it an edge over conventional automakers who rely more heavily on foreign assembly and parts. This strong U.S. presence also insulates Tesla from some of the volatility tied to global logistics and trade policy. As the EV landscape evolves, Tesla’s early commitment to building vehicles in America has allowed it to remain at the forefront of AMI rankings.

All of this results in lower monthly energy costs.","People are always looking for ways to save money, particularly on their monthly bills.

When it comes to energy costs, EnergySage spoke to several experts, and one thing became clear.

""News flash: We already have the answer,"" EnergySage said.

That relies largely on more widespread adoption of solar energy, those experts told EnergySage. As rooftop solar panels are more common, other options become available, such as expanded use of battery storage and virtual power plants.

As a leading, independent source for all things solar, EnergySage knows a thing or two about how to make that happen. Along with its objective information and advice, EnergySage also offers free tools that allow homeowners to quickly compare quotes from solar panel installers.

First, solar provides clean energy, free of the harmful carbon pollution caused by dirty sources like coal and gas. Roughly three-quarters of the United States' human-caused greenhouse gas pollution comes from burning fossil fuels for energy, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Renewable sources, like solar, can also be paired with battery storage to provide more stability. When the sun is shining, solar panels often create more energy than is needed for that moment. Battery units allow for that energy to be stored and used whenever it's needed.

Batteries are also key to virtual power plants, where utilities pay customers to use some of their excess stored energy. This allows customers to save even more on their energy costs while also giving utilities the ability to provide clean, low-cost energy to all their customers when the grid is stressed or down.

Using residential solar also keeps power local, which solves another problem. Studies have shown that about 6% of power is lost as electricity travels from power plants to homes. The closer our energy sources are, the more efficient our energy use is.

All of this results in lower monthly energy costs. By using EnergySage's tools, users can also see considerable savings on installation costs.

The company estimates that using its quote-comparison tool, people can save up to $10,000 on installation costs. By using EnergySage's mapping tool, users can see the average cost of a home solar panel system, along with any available incentives, for their state.

But anyone who wants to realize those savings may want to act quickly. Among the cuts being considered in Congress' budget negotiations is the Investment Tax Credit, which allows homeowners to deduct 30% of solar installation costs from their federal taxes — a savings of about $7,200 on a $24,000 installation.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/solar-energyimage-recCuDigKDIj8ftb6-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-06 04:02:46.648364

But the trucking industry has described an alarming situation for California sellers as a result.
""At the end of the day, California became a used truck market instead of a new truck market,"" she said.
INSIDE THE LOBBYING PUSH President Trump, at the ceremony to sign the legislation canceling the California rules, acknowledged controversy surrounding the move.
He noted that the trucking industry represents 4% of vehicles on the road in the United States but moves approximately 73% of all freight.","WASHINGTON -- As the Republican campaign to halt ambitious electric vehicle policies mostly spotlighted the cars and light trucks in personal garages and driveways across the country, a less-discussed part of the auto industry celebrated a center-stage moment last month.

""The trucking industry has America's back, and we are grateful that a president and the administration ... have our back too,"" veteran driver Gina Jones said at a June 12 White House event. President Donald Trump invited her to speak at a bill signing ceremony to cancel California's influential, strictest-in-the-nation emissions standards.

Jones, who has professionally driven over a million miles, spoke proudly on behalf of an industry that strongly lobbied against the environmental standards. California and states that voluntarily adopted identical rules had sought to quickly curb the trucking business's sizable contribution to planet-warming emissions.

To do so, the Golden State rules would have forced a transition to EVs across all segments of the auto industry more quickly than critics say the market is ready for. But the effect on medium and heavy-duty vehicles -- woven into the fabric of American life through delivery vans, firetrucks, cement mixers, tractor trailers and more -- might have been especially pronounced.

Chris Spear, president and CEO of the American Trucking Associations, said he felt ""just tremendous relief"" when Congress and Trump canceled the rules, which he called ""not even within the realm of possibility.""

Environmentalists have taken a different stance, suggesting that California regulators worked with businesses in crafting the rules and were always prepared to be flexible in the face of market realities.

""Congressional Republicans and the (Trump) administration taking a sledgehammer to these regulations ... really doesn't reflect the engagement and stakeholder process that was happening,"" said Guillermo Ortiz, a clean vehicles advocate for the Natural Resources Defense Council.

He added: ""We were hitting the gas and accelerating innovation here in the United States, but then they slammed the brakes so hard, it's giving everyone whiplash.""

RULES AND CLASSES

Spear's relief came after lawmakers controversially nixed two key federal waivers that allowed California to restrict emissions for medium and heavy-duty vehicles significantly more than federal standards.

One waiver granted in March 2023 allowed California's Advanced Clean Trucks regulation, which required zero-emission trucks to make up between 40% and 75% of all new model sales by 2035, depending on vehicle class. The rules defined ZEVs as fully battery-electric vehicles or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, which remain a barely available technology.

The other waiver, granted in December 2024, allowed the state's Heavy-Duty Low NOx Omnibus regulation to take effect. That rule would have required significant reductions in emissions of nitrogen oxides, a precursor to smog.

While sales of light-duty EVs have hovered around 10% of the national new vehicle market for the past two years, the transition to electric powertrains among heavier trucks and work vehicles has been slower. In some weight classes, according to data from the American Truck Dealers trade group, market share is yet to surpass 0.1%.

""We have to be in a position to actually achieve the targets and timelines that are put in these requirements, and the only way that happens is if they reflect reality,"" said Spear, a former executive for Hyundai Motor Co. ""And we didn't feel that a lot of the targets and timelines that California put forth did that.""

Ortiz, who strongly supported the rules, acknowledged that there would be different challenges for electrification across the highly varied medium and heavy-duty vehicle spectrum. E-commerce and delivery companies have already made significant deployments and purchase orders for vans, while long-haul trucking and other kinds of work vehicles have seen slower adoption.

American companies and public entities have committed to deploying close to 260,000 Class 2B and 3 electric cargo delivery vans into the next decade, according to a tracker compiled by the Environmental Defense Fund. The commitments for Class 7 and 8 tractor trucks total about 9,900.

The cargo category includes major commitments from e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc. and fleet management business Merchants Fleet. Amazon has committed to deploying 100,000 vans from EV startup Rivian Automotive Inc. by 2030, while Merchants Fleet has committed to about 30,000 total electric vans from General Motors Co.'s BrightDrop line and Stellantis NV's Ram brand.

The largest Class 8 truck commitment also came from Amazon, which committed to buying 1,250 electric Lion8 trucks from Volvo Cars with a target deployment later this year.

Ortiz said the rules were designed to account for different paces of electrification for each weight class. He also said that California, in response to current market conditions, was in the process of adjusting rules to allow credit trading across segments and participating states.

""No one wants a rule that fundamentally doesn't work or is destined to fail,"" he said. Those added flexibilities would have required federal signoff, however, which was always unlikely under a Trump administration that wanted to ditch the rules entirely.

Still, Ortiz noted, all vehicle classes have met their required targets so far in California. Notably, about 19.7% of new Class 2 vehicle registrations in the state last year were electric, well above mandated levels.

But the trucking industry has described an alarming situation for California sellers as a result. Sales in some segments fell by about 50% in 2024, according to the American Truck Dealers trade group.

Jacqueline Gelb, president of the group, said there was a ""significant market disruption"" in the state because of compliance pressures. She explained that there was limited ZEV truck demand from customers. In turn, that limited how many diesel-powered vehicles dealers could sell due to the sales percentage rules.

""At the end of the day, California became a used truck market instead of a new truck market,"" she said.

INSIDE THE LOBBYING PUSH

President Trump, at the ceremony to sign the legislation canceling the California rules, acknowledged controversy surrounding the move.

""People said it couldn't be done. You got it done,"" he said. ""But boy, it's been -- it's had us tied up in knots for years.""

Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin, congressional Republicans and conservative lawyers broke with precedent and typical parliamentary procedure to use the Congressional Review Act to revoke the Biden-era waivers.

Throughout the process, they were cheered on by lobbyists like the Trucking Associations' Spear, who pleaded to lawmakers about ""common sense"" and the potential harms to a key national sector. He noted that the trucking industry represents 4% of vehicles on the road in the United States but moves approximately 73% of all freight.

""I don't think our message was really geared toward Republicans or Democrats,"" he said in a phone interview. Spear said he started lobbying pitches by explaining his industry's past environmental progress.

""Because of our commitment to reducing our carbon footprint, and because of 40 years of work, we've reduced emissions coming out of (heavy-duty truck) tailpipes by 98.5% since 1988,"" Spear said. ""That's some really powerful and compelling numbers.""

He also pointed out that five states previously aligned with California's trucking regulations cancelled or eased enforcement for the next several years as businesses face significant cost and implementation hurdles.

""You're looking at over $400,000 per electric tractor to replace a $125,000 (diesel) tractor. So that's a big impediment, especially for the medium and small-sized companies,"" he said. ""And that's assuming you've got the charging infrastructure in place to plug into.""",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/imports/adg/photos/210511539_8G-trucking-0705-RGB_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4,N,,2025-07-06 06:02:44.805881

At the request of the three countries, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) developed these projects to help vulnerable communities anticipate and adapt to increasingly severe impacts of climate change through nature-based solutions, climate-resilient agriculture, early warning systems and improved water security.

Henry Gonzalez, Chief Investment Officer of the Green Climate Fund (GCF), said: “The approval of these projects demonstrates how GCF is supporting country ownership of national climate action priorities in Ghana, Maldives, and Mauritania. These investments will positively impact key areas of climate resilience in all three countries.”

The initiatives are a major step forward in deploying adaptation finance where it is most needed — particularly in Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and the Sahel region. They are expected to benefit more than 3.5 million people.

“These new projects reflect UNEP’s deep commitment to supporting countries on the frontlines of climate change,” said Martin Krause, Director of UNEP’s Climate Change Division. “Our focus is on contextualizing climate solutions to the benefit of the most vulnerable nations and communities with tailored, locally led, and science-based solutions.”

Ghana

Northern Ghana faces increasingly erratic rainfall and long dry seasons that have led to chronic food shortages, drying water bodies, and the destruction of infrastructure from flooding. Smallholder farmers, reliant on rainfed subsistence agriculture, are especially vulnerable. High temperatures reduce the land’s water-retention capacity, and extreme rain events risk dam collapse and downstream flooding.

In response, the new US$70 million project – including a US$63 million GCF grant – aims to build the resilience of agroecosystems and rural livelihoods. The initiative will support 120 communities across eight districts in the North East, Upper East, and Upper West regions.

Activities include improving access to climate data and early warnings, enabling dry season farming through water storage solutions, and restoring 28,000 hectares of degraded land to improve soil health, improve water retention and reduce flood risks.

Implemented by the Government of Ghana through the Environmental Protection Agency and Ghana Meteorological Agency, the project will benefit 619,000 people directly, while early warning alerts will reach up to 2.9 million people. Around 120,000 individuals will experience improved food security as a result of climate-resilient farming practices.

Maldives

Maldives is the world’s most exposed country to climate change. Comprising 1,192 islands, nearly 80 per cent of which lie less than one meter above sea level, Maldives faces the constant threat from rising sea levels.

In addition to rising seas, the country is vulnerable to more frequent and severe storm surges, floods, heatwaves, coastal erosion, and other hazards exacerbated by climate change. These hazards are already disrupting critical economic sectors such as agriculture, fisheries and tourism, affecting the entire population of Maldives. The poorest, most marginalised and remote communities, and women and children are particularly susceptible.

To strengthen the country’s ability to adapt to these threats and reduce vulnerability to climate change, UNEP, in coordination with several national and international partners, developed the project, Toward Risk-Aware and Climate-Resilient Communities (TRACT) – Strengthening Climate Services and Impact-Based Multi-Hazard Early Warning in the Maldives.

The US$25 million project – expected to benefit more than half a million people – will be implemented over five years under the lead of UNEP. It aligns with the goal of the Early Warnings for All initiative (EW4All) to ensure that everyone on Earth is protected from hazardous climate events through early warning systems by 2027 and it will deliver on the Maldives’ roadmap to achieve the EW4All Initiative, developed by the Government of Maldives and international partners to guide the scaling up of early warning systems in the country.

Mauritania

In the fragile zone between the Sahara and Sahel, prolonged droughts, sand encroachment, and water scarcity are threatening lives and livelihoods. Mauritania has seen accelerating dune movement, siltation of water sources, and growing pressure on socio-economic infrastructure such as roads and schools. Agricultural output remains extremely low, with the country importing up to 85 per cent of its food.

With a US$33 million investment — including a US$30 million GCF grant — the new UNEP project will restore ecosystems and secure livelihoods in four vulnerable hubs: Aoujeft, Rachid, Tamcheket, and Nema. It will support green-grey infrastructure to fix dunes and control sand encroachment, improve access to water for farming and land rehabilitation, and scale up climate-resilient agriculture to boost food security and incomes.

Led by Mauritania’s Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development, the project will directly benefit 85,000 people and improve resilience for 145,000 more. It will also protect 2,100 hectares of land and support the country’s contributions to the Great Green Wall — a multilateral African initiative to combat desertification and build climate resilience across the continent.

It was part of the president's tax and spending bill he signed into law Friday.
This credit was implemented through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and administered by the Internal Revenue Service.
Gin also noted that the end of the tax credit would disproportionately affect certain income groups.
""With that ending in September 30th what that means is if you're thinking about getting an electric vehicle you should jump on it,"" she said.","SAN DIEGO — The federal tax credit for electric vehicles (EVs), which was expected to last through 2032, is set to expire towards the end of September, potentially impacting the out-of-pocket costs for consumers planning to go electric. It was part of the president's tax and spending bill he signed into law Friday.

The tax incentive has allowed taxpayers to qualify for up to $7,500 in tax credits for new EVs and up to $4,000 for pre-owned vehicles, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. This credit was implemented through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and administered by the Internal Revenue Service.

""It's really kind of sad that it's ending because it's going to mean the ending to a lot of green energy jobs, a lot of electric vehicle jobs around the country,"" said Elaine Borseth, President of the San Diego chapter of the Electric Vehicle Association.

The expiration of these credits could have significant implications for EV sales and adoption rates. Alan Gin, an economics professor at the University of San Diego's Knauss School of Business, explained the potential impact: ""They are normally more expensive than gas powered cars so that helps buyers so if you take them away I think that will cause sales to slow.""

Gin also noted that the end of the tax credit would disproportionately affect certain income groups. ""The low to medium income ranges are going to be impacted most by this because they have less income and these incentives then allowed them to purchase these electric vehicles,"" he said.

For those considering purchasing an EV, Borseth advises acting quickly.

And there is something happening in almost every community that is part of a clean energy transition.","On May 8th, 2025, the Network for Responsible Public Policy (NFRPP) convened a session to discuss the future of the transition to clean energy in the face of some stiff headwinds caused by the new US administration led by Donald Trump. The panel included Dale Bryk, Director of State and Regional Policy at the Harvard Environmental and Energy Law Program and a Senior Fellow at the Regional Plan Association, and Dan Sosland, President of the Acadia Center. The discussion was moderated by Richard Eidlin, National Policy Director for Business for America.

The actions of the Trump administration are somewhat surprising, given the campaign rhetoric at face value. While the administration promised an end to burdensome Federal regulation and an era of new Federalism, the current policy regarding clean energy and the environment has been anything but. The president’s executive order “Unleashing American Energy”, issued on January 20th, 2025, is, in fact, a heavy-handed intrusion by the Federal government into state and local energy policies, and reads, according to Bryk, like a “mindless assault on anything that sounds clean.”

While the acts of the current administration will make a transition to clean energy more difficult, the message from Bryk was that “the arc of history bends towards clean energy.” The transition will happen because, politics aside, the science is now clear and not in dispute. So what can be done in the face of an administration that is antagonistic to this transition? As described by the panel, US states in fact have a tremendous amount of jurisdiction over not only energy policies, but over the industries that primarily contribute to climate change, such as transportation and housing. And the advice from Bryk to those state and local governments is “not to chase the chaos.” Most states and communities have affirmative agendas for their energy policies, and those need to be defended, including in the courts.

There is a long history of Federal and state collaboration on various programs, and many states also cooperate among themselves to agree on, for example, emission limits from power plants operating within those states. Historically, these efforts have broad bipartisan support. One of the points repeatedly mentioned during this presentation was that there is more agreement on the need for an energy transition than might be apparent based on the highly polarized talking points visible at the national level. But how is this possible?

Part of the reason is that the discussion at the state and local levels is not necessarily about “climate change.” In fact, how we discuss the transition to clean energy is a complicated issue itself, and what we say can also obscure what is happening in many states. Bryk emphasized that in many states, “climate is not the driver. Job creation is the driver.” Or, reducing energy costs is the driver, or just trying to keep energy dollars local is the driver. It can be surprising for people steeped in climate change discussions to learn that the US states that generate the most wind power (Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas) or have the most widespread use of heat pumps (South Carolina) do not have the most aggressive climate policies. They have other priorities that align with the desire to make a transition to clean energy, and the climate impact may be just a side benefit, for now. On the topic of the transition to clean energy, the American electorate has more in common than it has differences. Even conservatives argue that the Trump energy policy is interfering in the market, and is not allowing renewable energy sources to move to the forefront. However, it is often economically advantageous for them to do so.

So, how we talk about this issue matters. As Sosland emphasized, we are all paying for the costs of the energy choices we are currently making. We pay not just in terms of dollars, but also in terms of the impact on the climate and our own health. “We need to do a better job in the climate community of framing a message that works. We talk so much about cost, so much about utility and other kinds of economics…we are really talking about human beings in flood zones, coughing, getting sick. We are talking about humans here. The human impact of this issue is not even being addressed. That has to change. It has to turn around.” As Bryk put it, “The underlying values that we have are not controversial, and that’s a place where we can start and have conversations about these things with our families and our friends.”

If the transition is going to happen, however, it’s not the case that unleashed market forces by themselves will get us to where we want to be. As Bryk recognized, we know that there are “communities across the country that have been overburdened by pollution and underserved by the clean energy solutions.” There is a disconnect, and it’s important to think about what, as she says, a “just and orderly transition looks like, economic sector by economic sector. To make that transition orderly, we will need policies to be put into place that avoid the failures that often occur in the market. “That’s part of what we have to think about when we are thinking about equitable transition … all of those opportunities to intervene and help it work better and prevent the bad things from happening that can happen in a transition.”

The approach of the current administration will pose the greatest challenges to our ability to create just policies. Although states and communities have power, states cannot do everything when plans involve, for example, Federal leases, and the government may renege on those contracts. This makes it extremely difficult to conduct business. “What can you rely on if you can’t rely on the signature of the US government on a signed contract?” Bryk asked. The opposition of the Federal government to enabling a clean energy transition is especially surprising, given that data shows economic forces are already pushing in that direction. Sosland reminded us that in the Northeast region of the country, energy production was 21% based on coal just 10-15 years ago. It is now less than 1% coal. Market pressures are driving the shift away from fossil fuels. This is why the panel believes that the transition is inevitable, but the opposition of the Federal government will delay the transition timeframe, and that may or may not be the time that we have. International agreements aim to achieve goals by 2030, 2035, and 2050. If we are not on track to meet the first targets, we will either not meet or it will be much more expensive to meet the 2050 target. So, while the technology and ingenuity is in place, the policies of the current administration are incredibly damaging. “This isn’t a blip, necessarily, that is affordable. Losing four or more years is really going to be damaging to meeting the 2030, 2035 targets as we head to 2050,” Sosland reminded us. “There is an enormous amount to worry about,” Bryk said. We are currently in a very precarious position. I have confidence in the states, cities, communities, and some businesses. But, we are not meeting many targets that many states and companies have set. And now we are being hamstrung in a way … that’s out of our power. But there are always other places where we can make a lot of progress,” said Bryk.

And this last comment highlighted the areas of optimism that the panel wanted to emphasize. While the stance of the current US administration can be disheartening, the panel believes that considerable good can be achieved at the state and local levels.

For example, small communities are doing quite a bit. Putting solar farms on landfills. Creating bike paths as alternatives to cars. Massachusetts has incentives to adopt very stringent energy codes, so new buildings are being constructed to very high standards. Many states with climate policies are demonstrably improving the quality of life in their communities. Almost all states (44) participate in the Climate Pollution Reduction Grant Program, a policy initiated under the IRA. Whether or not these states have explicit climate policies doesn’t matter as much as the fact that they see good reasons to pursue a migration to a clean energy infrastructure. They have recognized that we are always spending money on energy infrastructure, so we can choose to allocate it to options that will yield greater benefits and longer lifespans.

If there is so much agreement on the underlying principles, why does it still seem so difficult to talk about it? The answer to that seems to be that, at the current level of polarization in our society, it is challenging to discuss anything that has become a political litmus test. How to talk about this issue was branded by Bryk as the “question of our time.” The advice given by this panel was to adopt the old aphorism, “think globally, and act locally.” It is hard to have these conversations at the national level, but easier at the state level, and even easier at the community level. And there is something happening in almost every community that is part of a clean energy transition. So, getting involved at the local level, for example, with local faith organizations, was described as one of the best ways to engage in this issue while avoiding much of the damaging political rhetoric.

Under Donald J. Trump’s America First energy policy, not so much.
These lawsuits needlessly clog the courts, so a growing number of state and federal judges are starting to slam the doors on them.
In the past few months, judges in Maryland, New Jersey and Pennsylvania have dismissed climate lawsuits as being outside the scope of state law.
The Environmental Law Institute’s Climate Judiciary Project has “briefed” more than 2,000 judges in closed-door sessions with no public oversight on issues including climate science and litigation strategy.","Under Joe Biden, filing lawsuits against energy producers and accusing them of harming the environment was cool. Under Donald J. Trump’s America First energy policy, not so much.

The David vs. Goliath narrative has collapsed on the altar of proof. What had been sold to the public and policymakers as a righteous battle on behalf of the voiceless has been exposed as a series of coordinated political stunts driven by activist law firms, dark-money donors and operatives looking to have left-leaning judges formulate American energy policy from the bench.

On June 25, a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing led by Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz investigated the various outside entities perpetuating these lawsuits, including the San Francisco-based plaintiffs’ firm Sher Edling LLP and the Environmental Law Institute.

Critics say these groups aren’t interested in pursuing justice or protecting the environment. Instead, they’re shaking down the energy industry using the threat of billion-dollar damages to bring about extreme policy changes that voters and lawmakers have both rejected.

These lawsuits needlessly clog the courts, so a growing number of state and federal judges are starting to slam the doors on them.

In the past few months, judges in Maryland, New Jersey and Pennsylvania have dismissed climate lawsuits as being outside the scope of state law. Pennsylvania Judge Stephen Corr put it this way: The “claims raised … are not justiciable by any state court.” Similar decisions have been rendered by judges in Baltimore; Bucks County, Pennsylvania; and Anne Arundel County, Maryland, all of whom recognized the Clean Air Act delegates the authority to set emissions policy to the federal government, not to trial lawyers acting as climate crusaders.

Cases making the counterargument persist because an activist ecosystem gratuitously props them up. Sher Edling, operating on a contingency fee basis and bankrolled by dark-money funds such as the Collective Action Fund, has filed more than two dozen nearly identical lawsuits on behalf of states and municipalities. The objective is a massive payout emerging from a single court that breaks with the precedent being quickly established.

The Environmental Law Institute’s Climate Judiciary Project has “briefed” more than 2,000 judges in closed-door sessions with no public oversight on issues including climate science and litigation strategy. The curriculum for these sessions was developed by academics and lawyers tied to the lawsuits themselves, notably former UCLA Professor Ann Carlson, a Biden appointee who helped fundraise and consult for the law firm.

This isn’t education. It’s lobbying cloaked in robes. And the consequences are severe. We’re told these lawsuits are about accountability. They’re really about politics, power and paychecks. This is lawfare, pure and simple, intended to pressure settlements, vilify American energy and circumvent the legislative process. Even Puerto Rico, once a willing participant, saw the writing on the wall. Just days after the DOJ moved to block similar cases in other states, the Commonwealth withdrew its lawsuit against the energy companies.

It was a smart move, one that other states should follow. Yet some, such as Hawaii and California, continue. In New Jersey, a judge dismissed the state’s case with prejudice, warning that global emissions can’t be regulated piecemeal through state courts. In Maryland, a judge reversed an earlier decision to allow Annapolis and Anne Arundel County’s case to proceed, citing mounting rulings across jurisdictions that found the legal theory doesn’t apply to state laws.

Still, the activist machine rolls on. The Federal Judicial Center, the research arm of the federal court system, is collaborating with the Environmental Law Institute to provide judges with curated content that aligns with Sher Edling’s litigation narratives. A joint congressional investigation revealed that UCLA’s environmental law clinic has even admitted to providing legal assistance to Sher Edling on these suits — students doing the groundwork while activist lawyers cash in.

This is not the fair, impartial justice system Americans expect. It’s a coordinated campaign — funded in secret, litigated in bulk and designed to wear down the courts until someone, somewhere cracks. So far, the legal system is holding. It’s time for state leaders still involved in this mess to wake up.

Climate litigation may sound noble in a press release. In practice, it’s a bait-and-switch that wastes taxpayer money, undermines judicial integrity and accomplishes nothing. Governors and attorneys general need to stop enabling this legal charade. Drop the lawsuits. Reject the backroom influence of law firms, advocacy groups and their money enablers. Focus on generating reliable energy solutions that work for the future.

The climate litigation house of cards is falling. Who wants to be left holding the last worthless case?

Malaysia is already one of the world’s top producers of photovoltaic (PV) cells and modules, hosting industry giants such as First Solar, LONGi, and JA Solar. The country's well-established electronics supply chain, coupled with favorable tax incentives and government support under the National Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR), is accelerating foreign direct investment (FDI) into the renewable energy sector.

Key Drivers for Foreign Participation in Solar:

Competitive labor and infrastructure costs

Duty-free access to major export markets

Strategic location in Southeast Asia

Pro-renewable energy policies and tax incentives

Participation in ESG-aligned industrial ecosystems

The Ministry of Investment, Trade and Industry (MITI) has identified solar manufacturing as a strategic growth sector, with foreign investors playing a crucial role in scaling up capacity.

The Rise of Sustainable Industrial Parks

To support green industry growth, developers are now prioritizing sustainable features in new industrial park developments. These parks incorporate:

Solar-ready rooftops for tenant factories

Rainwater harvesting systems

Green building certifications (e.g., GBI, LEED)

Smart energy grids for efficient power distribution

EV charging infrastructure and last-mile logistics

Foreign firms, especially those with strong ESG mandates, are seeking industrial spaces that align with their corporate sustainability goals. As a result, sustainable industrial parks are becoming magnets for multinational tenants in sectors like clean energy, EV battery production, and high-tech electronics.

Case Studies: Foreign-Led Green Development

Kulim Hi-Tech Park (Kedah): Home to foreign solar manufacturers such as First Solar, investing over RM4 billion in new capacity.

Batu Kawan Industrial Park (Penang): Integrates green features and attracts ESG-conscious global manufacturers.

i-Park@Senai Airport City (Johor): Features a green-certified design that appeals to foreign investors from Europe and Japan.

These developments underscore how green infrastructure is now a business imperative, not just a branding strategy.

Opportunities for Local and International Stakeholders

Malaysia’s commitment to sustainable development is more than policy—it’s becoming an economic engine. With the New Industrial Master Plan 2030 (NIMP 2030) emphasizing clean growth, opportunities abound in:

Green logistics and supply chain services

Energy-efficient factory design and retrofitting

Industrial solar power solutions

Water and waste management technologies

Conclusion

Foreign participation in Malaysia’s solar manufacturing and sustainable industrial park development is accelerating rapidly. As global companies align operations with sustainability targets, Malaysia offers a unique value proposition: cost-efficiency, green compliance, and regional connectivity.

Newsom accused President Trump and his supporters of using the bill to advance a political agenda that benefits the wealthy while hurting working Americans.","California Governor Gavin Newsom is sharply criticizing a newly passed bill backed by President Donald Trump, calling it a “moral failure” that endangers millions of Americans — especially working families, students, and the state’s most vulnerable communities.

The legislation, dubbed the “Big, Beautiful Bill,” was passed by House Republicans and signed by the President not long thereafter.

It’s being touted by Trump as a centerpiece of his economic agenda. But Newsom says the bill “rips care from cancer patients, meals from children, and money from working families” to give tax breaks to the ultra-wealthy.

“With this measure, Donald J. Trump’s legacy is now forever cemented: he has created a more unequal, more indebted, and more dangerous America. Shame on him,” Newsom stated.

What the bill does

The sweeping legislation cuts billions in federal spending from programs that provide health care, food assistance, college aid, and public safety resources, while granting significant tax relief to high-income earners and corporations.

According to Governor Newsom’s office, the impact on California could be severe and includes the following:

Health care:

$28.4 billion in Medicaid cuts to California.

Up to 17 million people nationwide projected to lose coverage by 2034.

Cuts that may force rural hospitals across the state to close or limit care options.

Jobs:

An estimated 686,000 California jobs could be lost due to the elimination of clean energy tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act.

Labor groups have called the legislation possibly the “biggest job-killing bill in American history.”

Food and family assistance:

Cuts food aid for more than 3 million people nationwide.

Raises taxes for parents who pay for child care.

Public safety:

$646 million cut from FEMA, impacting disaster preparedness.

Cuts to the FBI, DEA, and ATF, reducing law enforcement staffing and capabilities.

Nearly $500 million slashed from cybersecurity efforts, raising concerns over national infrastructure security.

Education and student aid:

Restricts access to Pell Grants and financial aid.

Eliminates loan forgiveness options and deferments for borrowers facing financial hardship.

Environmental and climate programs:

Eliminates wildfire prevention programs, a direct threat to fire-prone regions of California.

Imposes new penalties on hybrid and electric vehicle owners, undermining green energy incentives.

Reproductive rights:

Defunds Planned Parenthood, jeopardizing health care access for more than 1.1 million patients.

Immigration and family separation:

Expands funding for immigration raids, increasing the risk of family separation and workplace crackdowns, particularly in agricultural areas.

Newsom accused President Trump and his supporters of using the bill to advance a political agenda that benefits the wealthy while hurting working Americans. On the other side, the President called the legislative victory “a triumph of democracy.”",https://ktla.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/07/Newsom-Trump_010925_AP_Rick-Scuteri-and-Rich-Pedroncelli.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-07-06 02:00:07.077768

The deadline for removing the EV credit is set for September 30, leaving people a whole quarter to buy an EV and deduct the $7,500 credit.
Even if customers have not shown much interest in electric vehicles lately, the fear of missing out is a powerful incentive.
The bill could turn out to be the best promotional material for Tesla and other carmakers who sell electric vehicles.","Donald Trump has always hated electric vehicles and everything related to clean transportation, clean energy, and other clean stuff. Not because he knows that they are inherently bad but because he associates them with left activists, the so-called ""woke spirit,"" and, ultimately, the Democrats. Six months after being sworn in, Trump fulfilled his wish to scrap most EV, battery, and clean energy incentives that Biden had included in his Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

There are several ironies at play here, the first being that Trump (and the Republicans who helped pass the bill) removed the money that funded clean projects in mostly red states. Citizens of these states will be among the most affected by scrapping these incentives. By voting for the bill, Republicans jeopardized the livelihoods of their constituents.

The second irony is that Elon Musk paid big dollars to have his subsidies removed. You can say that, without Musk's money and his social media network, Trump wouldn't be in the White House, and the GOP would not have a majority in both the House and the Senate. Without Musk, the Big Beautiful Bill would've remained just a crazy idea inside the twisted mind of a grumpy old man.

Despite knowing exactly what Trump wanted to do, Elon Musk is now very upset about losing the subsidies for his companies. Without the EV tax credit, fewer people would be able to afford a Tesla, especially if Musk won't be able to keep the battery incentives, which amount to $45 per kWh. The bill introduces stricter requirements for battery content and equipment sourcing, the latter being harder to meet. Tesla is building an LFP battery factory with excess equipment sourced from China's CATL, which will not qualify for the battery subsidies under the new rules.

Losing incentives is a big blow to EV adoption

Besides Tesla, other carmakers that invested big in electric vehicles and Li-ion batteries will also be affected. EV sales have dwindled for the past few years, and the federal credits were a huge help in making them accessible to a wider customer base. Tesla and Ford have reported a significant decrease in EV sales in the second quarter, while GM increased its market share.

Rivian is also in trouble, barely making ends meet. Even though Rivian EVs are too expensive to qualify for the EV tax credit, they benefitted from the similar commercial clean vehicle credit. As this will also be canceled on September 30, Rivian will lose an important incentive for its vehicles. Both Rivian and Tesla will lose another important revenue stream: ZEV credits.

While the bill doesn't directly cancel the ZEV credits, it eliminates the reason they have become a commodity. Trump's bill effectively kills the ZEV credit market by removing the penalties for carmakers that fail to meet the federal Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards. These credits enabled Rivian to claim a positive gross margin in the past two quarters. Tesla also relied on them, especially in Q1 2025, when its profits plummeted. Tesla would've posted a loss in Q1 2025 if not for the ZEV credits.

Tesla reported another year-over-year sales decline in the second quarter, following a disastrous first quarter. This is why Elon Musk insists that Tesla is no longer a carmaker and car sales are irrelevant. However, until autonomous driving and its Robotaxi service earn more money than the automotive business, Tesla will remain a car company. And it will need its automotive arm to perform strongly in the foreseeable future to stay afloat.

The silver lining: more people will rush to buy an EV this summer

With subsidies removed, this becomes even more problematic. However, the bill has a silver lining: the possibility to deduct up to $10,000 for car loan interest for American-made vehicles. There's another side effect that could benefit Tesla and other EV markers in the short term. The deadline for removing the EV credit is set for September 30, leaving people a whole quarter to buy an EV and deduct the $7,500 credit.

This will likely cause a buying frenzy as people rush to secure an electric car while the credit is still available. Even if customers have not shown much interest in electric vehicles lately, the fear of missing out is a powerful incentive. The bill could turn out to be the best promotional material for Tesla and other carmakers who sell electric vehicles.

Undoubtedly, the massive demand in the third quarter will cause some bottlenecks, which might cause price increases or at least remove sales incentives from the table. It happens every time when a lot of people try to buy a car in a short period. This is a boon for EV makers, although it will be a short-lived consolation.",https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/instead-of-killing-the-evs-trump-s-bill-will-turn-buying-one-into-a-gold-rush-this-summer-253940_1.jpg,N,,2025-07-06 03:00:38.288487

Allison has been investing in its vehicle electrification portfolio over the years, including a new R&D facility in Michigan.","Allison and Dana are not household names in the electric vehicle field on the order of, say, Tesla. However, the two US-based firms have been in the propulsion business for more than 100 years apiece, and last month they completed a $2.7 billion transaction aimed partly at cementing their respective footprints in global electric vehicle markets.

The Global Electric Vehicle Market Is Calling

EV sales in the US face a somewhat uncertain future domestically, due to an abrupt shift in federal electrification policy this year. Nevertheless, so far, US demand for EVs has held steady, with the notable exception of Tesla.

General Motors, in particular, is very excited about EV sales in the Q2 report it posted earlier this week. In addition, global EV sales continue to rise at a healthy clip, BYD’s electric truck division being one outstanding example. Regardless of domestic policy, US-headquartered firms with a global footprint are following the money.

Both Allison Transmission Holdings of Indiana (founded 1915) and Dana Incorporated of Ohio (founded 1904) are diversified drivetrain and propulsion firms with a firm grip on the internal combustion engine business. Still, as Allison noted in a press release last month, there is money to be made in vehicle electrification.

On June 11, Allison announced that it has acquired Dana’s off-highway business. The $2.7 billion transaction “aligns with Allison’s strategic priorities to expand its emerging markets footprint, enhance core technologies and deliver strong financial results,” Allison explained.

“Upon completion of the transaction, Allison will be able to offer a wider range of commercial-duty powertrain and industrial solutions to more customers and end users worldwide,” the company added.

Combining “emerging markets” with “worldwide,” it sure seems like Allison has bigger fish to fry than the US electric vehicle market. To re-emphasize again, the company does not intend to drop its core business like a hot potato, but the company’s focus on the EV-friendly Asia-Pacific market indicates that the transition to the electric vehicle market is under way.

The Dana transaction is not a one-off. Allison has been investing in its vehicle electrification portfolio over the years, including a new R&D facility in Michigan. The Dana acquisition kicks the activity level up a notch.

“This acquisition marks a transformative milestone in our commitment to empowering our current and future customers with propulsion and drivetrain solutions that Improve the Way the World Works,” emphasized Allison Chair and CEO David Graziosi in a press statement.

“We look forward to harnessing this momentum to increase value for all of our stakeholders worldwide,” he emphasized again.

What’s In It For Dana?

Meanwhile, Dana has been on an electrification journey of its own. The shedding the off-highway line was an unexpected windfall for the company’s future plans. At $2.7 billion, the transaction “represents 7x the expected 2025 adjusted EBITDA of the Off-Highway business,” Dana reported in a press statement, with EBITDA referring to the standard financial measurement Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization.

As with Allison, Dana has no intention of dropping the ICE shoe any time soon. However, alongside other cost-cutting measures the Allison transaction will enable Dana to focus more closely on the growing demand for electric vehicles among fleet owners.

“As we committed to last year, the sale of the Off-Highway business supports our strategy to become a streamlined light- and commercial-vehicle supplier with traditional and electrified systems,” explained R. Bruce McDonald, Dana’s Chairman and CEO in a press statement on June 11.

“Dana has taken a leading position in vehicle electrification. In fact, with in-house gearbox, low- to high-voltage motor, inverter, controls, and thermal and battery management expertise, we are the only supplier capable of delivering all elements of a complete, fully integrated electrified system across all mobility markets,” Dana reminds everyone on its website. The company also launched the LEED-certified Sustainable Mobility Center at its World Headquarters campus in Maumee, Ohio in 2022.

The fleet market is an all-important one for Dana, which has had a bumpy ride over the past several years. If all goes according to plan, the Allison transaction will help Dana keep up with the Joneses as it navigates the fleet industry’s transition to electrification and digitization (see more fleet electrification background here).

Dana already has a head start through its existing relationships in the ICE world.

By integrating molten salt reactor technology with water desalination systems, the initiative aims to purify produced water for beneficial use, offering a sustainable solution to the state’s pressing issues. This collaboration between universities and private firms not only promises to enhance energy security but also positions Texas as a leader in clean energy innovation.

Collaborative Innovation in Energy and Water Management

The collaborative effort involving Texas Tech University, Abilene Christian University (ACU), Natura Resources, and the Texas Produced Water Consortium is pivotal in advancing energy and water security. According to Lawrence Schovanec, President of Texas Tech University, the partnership is a testament to their commitment to innovation and sustainability. The construction of the molten salt research reactor at ACU represents the first of its kind in over 30 years in the United States, emphasizing the groundbreaking nature of this initiative. By leveraging cutting-edge technology, the project aims to desalinate produced water, thereby addressing a critical challenge in resource management.

The significance of this project extends beyond water desalination. The MSR-1 is expected to generate life-saving medical isotopes, essential for cancer treatment and advanced medical procedures. This aspect not only alleviates global shortages but also establishes Texas as a leader in medical innovation. With the support of the Texas Legislature, this collaboration is set to deploy an advanced, liquid-fueled reactor, reinforcing the state’s position in clean energy and medical technology.

Steps Toward Commercial Deployment

The Natura Resources MSR-1 project is a crucial step toward the commercial deployment of molten salt reactor technology in the Permian Basin. This initiative is not only focused on providing energy but also on the beneficial use of produced water. The allocation of resources to Texas Tech and ACU underscores the commitment to research, development, permitting, licensing, and construction of the MSR-1. The Nuclear Energy eXperimental Testing Laboratory at ACU plays a central role in these efforts.

In addition to energy production, the MSR technology is set to produce medical isotopes that are vital for modern healthcare. This dual functionality highlights the versatility and potential of molten salt reactors in addressing diverse challenges. Doug Robison, founder and CEO of Natura Resources, expressed gratitude to the Texas Legislature for their historic commitment to nuclear innovation. This support positions Texas as a leader in clean energy and medical technology, paving the way for future advancements in these fields.

Revolutionary Features of Molten Salt Reactors

Molten salt reactors, such as the MSR-1, utilize liquid fuel in the form of molten salts, offering several advantages over traditional nuclear reactors. By cooling with molten salt instead of water, these reactors operate at lower pressures, enhancing safety and accessibility. The use of lithium fluoride (LiF) and beryllium fluoride (BeF2) salts, or thorium fluoride salts, enables operation at higher temperatures, opening new opportunities for industrial applications requiring constant power and high heat.

One of the key benefits of molten salt reactors is their ability to recycle spent nuclear fuel, reducing waste and improving sustainability. Natura Resources emphasizes that the MSR technology represents a safer, cheaper, and more accessible form of nuclear power. The recent appropriation from the Texas Legislature, endorsed by Governor Greg Abbott, accelerates the research and construction of the molten salt research reactor in Abilene. This commitment highlights the importance of advancing produced water research in collaboration with academic and industry partners.

Future Implications and Opportunities

The deployment of the Natura Resources MSR-1 project in Texas symbolizes a transformative approach to energy and water management. By addressing critical challenges in these areas, the initiative sets a precedent for future developments in clean energy and medical technology. The integration of molten salt reactor technology with water desalination systems not only offers a sustainable solution but also positions Texas as a global leader in innovation.

The successful implementation of this project raises important questions about the future of energy and resource management. How will other states and countries respond to the advancements in molten salt reactor technology, and what implications will this have for global energy policies? As Texas leads the way, the potential for wider adoption of these technologies remains an exciting prospect for the future.

Accelerating the Review Process

The NRC’s expedited timeline for the Natrium project has been a game-changer. Originally slated for completion in August 2026, the commission now expects to wrap up its comprehensive safety and environmental evaluation by the end of 2025. This advancement comes as a result of frequent and productive engagements with TerraPower, coupled with other efficiency gains. However, the NRC emphasizes that this accelerated schedule hinges on TerraPower’s ongoing commitment to addressing outstanding issues promptly. Notably, TerraPower was the first to submit a construction permit application for a commercial advanced reactor to the NRC in March 2024, highlighting their pioneering role in this sector.

Chris Levesque, TerraPower’s President and CEO, acknowledged this milestone, stating that it underscores the exceptional work of their Natrium team and the robust support for advanced reactors at the federal level. This faster review process is not just a testament to the project’s innovative nature but also a reflection of the growing confidence in advanced nuclear technologies as viable components of the US energy mix.

Innovative Design and Technology

The Natrium project’s design is truly groundbreaking, featuring a 345-megawatt sodium-cooled fast reactor combined with a patented molten salt-based energy storage system. This innovative storage technology can enhance the system’s output to 500 megawatts when necessary, offering flexibility and efficiency in energy production. The project’s site in Kemmerer, Wyoming, is notably located on a retiring coal-fired power plant, symbolizing a significant shift towards cleaner energy sources.

As the first advanced nuclear developer to start construction on a commercial-scale project in the US, TerraPower is paving the way for future developments in the field. The collaboration with the US Department of Energy’s Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ARDP) further solidifies the project’s importance, as it aims to accelerate the development and deployment of new reactor technologies. This public-private partnership is vital for fostering innovation and ensuring that the US remains at the forefront of nuclear technology advancements.

Progressing Through Challenges

Despite the ambitious nature of the Natrium project, TerraPower has managed to navigate the challenges posed by such a pioneering endeavor. The NRC’s decision to allow non-nuclear construction to begin on the plant’s energy production and storage portions this year is a significant step forward. This exemption enables work on the non-nuclear island to proceed while the review of the nuclear components continues. This strategic approach ensures that the project remains on track for its expected commercial operation by 2031.

The groundbreaking ceremony in June last year marked the official start of construction at the Kemmerer site, setting the stage for what promises to be a transformative project for the US energy landscape. As TerraPower continues to make strides, the Natrium project serves as a critical component of the US’ advanced reactor program, which is geared towards expediting the development of new nuclear technologies.

A Pioneering Energy Future

As the Natrium project progresses, it stands as a beacon of innovation and progress in the energy sector. Once the construction permit is granted, TerraPower will proceed with a separate application for an operational license, marking the next phase in this ambitious journey. The project’s success could potentially pave the way for more advanced nuclear projects across the country, offering a sustainable solution to America’s growing energy demands.

The implications of the Natrium project extend far beyond Wyoming. This initiative could serve as a model for other states looking to transition from coal to cleaner energy sources. With the potential to significantly reduce carbon emissions, the Natrium project embodies a bold step towards a sustainable energy future. As we look ahead, the question remains: How will this pioneering project influence the broader adoption of advanced nuclear technologies in the US and beyond?

Amid rising geopolitical tensions, especially in the Middle East, Japan has received some welcome news on the energy front. Mitsubishi Corporation is preparing to begin importing liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Canada. These shipments will be primarily destined for the Japanese market.

This will be the first major delivery of Canadian LNG to Japan, which currently depends on Australia and Malaysia for over half of its LNG imports.

With limited domestic energy resources, Japan has been actively working to diversify its LNG supply. Australia, its largest supplier, is projected to face production declines in the coming years. This highlights the need for more stable and reliable sources. Canadian LNG, backed by geographic proximity and political stability, presents a strong alternative. It could play a key role in strengthening Japan's energy security.

Diversifying Japan's LNG Supply

LNG is natural gas that has been cooled to a liquid state, reducing its volume to about one-600th and making it much easier to transport by sea.

Japan does produce some natural gas domestically, mainly in areas like Niigata and Chiba, but this supply falls far short of meeting national demand. Like oil, Japan relies almost entirely on imports for its natural gas.

With delays in restarting nuclear power plants, Japan remains heavily dependent on thermal power, which generates around 70% of the country's electricity. Gas-fired power plants are the largest contributors.

Compared to other fossil fuels, natural gas produces less CO₂, making it a relatively cleaner option. Because of its key role in electricity generation, any disruption in LNG supply could have serious consequences for the economy and daily life. In fiscal 2024, Japan imported 65.87 million tons of LNG, making it the world's second-largest importer after China.

The LNG Canada Project

The new LNG supply will come from the LNG Canada project in British Columbia, a facility developed with investment from Mitsubishi Corporation, Shell, and other partners. Natural gas is extracted inland and transported via a 670-kilometer pipeline to the coast. There, it is liquefied and shipped overseas by tanker.

The project represents a total investment of about $14 billion USD and has an annual production capacity of 14 million tons. Mitsubishi holds a 15% stake, giving it rights to around 2.1 million tons per year. If all of that were exported to Japan, it would cover roughly a quarter of the country's projected increase in LNG demand.

Mitsubishi's LNG Expertise

Mitsubishi was the first major Japanese trading company to enter the LNG business, beginning in the 1960s. Today, it is involved in LNG projects across more than 10 countries. With the addition of Canadian supply, Mitsubishi's annual LNG production capacity has grown to around 15 million tons, the largest among Japanese companies.

Katsumi Saito, Senior Executive Officer overseeing the fuel business and related operations, commented, ""Our strength lies in the knowledge and development capabilities built on more than 50 years of experience.""

One of the key advantages of Canadian LNG is proximity. Shipping LNG from Canada's west coast to Japan takes about 10 days — much shorter than the roughly 30 days required from the US Gulf Coast via the Panama Canal. That route can take even longer when canal traffic is restricted by drought.

Avoiding Chokepoints and Longer Routes

Other shipping routes, such as around the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, can take up to 60 days. LNG from the Middle East typically takes about 16 days. In contrast, Canadian LNG avoids major chokepoints like the Strait of Hormuz, offering more stable and reliable delivery.

Canada also has vast natural gas reserves — enough to meet Japan's current annual LNG demand for about 25 years. Its cold climate makes the liquefaction process more energy-efficient. Canadian LNG has a higher heat content than LNG from the United States. On top of that, there is strong political support in Canada for energy exports, ensuring long-term policy stability.

As of fiscal 2024, Australia supplies 38% of Japan's LNG. Although shipping times from Australia are similar to those from Canada, slower gas field development — driven by climate change policies — has raised concerns about future supply. To reduce risks, Japan has also prioritized LNG imports from the United States, Qatar, which has massive reserves, and Russia.

The US has significantly increased its LNG exports in recent years. Qatar, however, faces geopolitical risks, especially due to tensions with Iran. Japan continues to import LNG from Russia, but new projects have been put on hold under US sanctions. For instance, Japanese trading firms like Mitsui & Co are currently unable to engage with Russia's Arctic LNG 2 project.

Growing Electricity Demand

Japan's electricity demand is expected to grow as the number of data centers increases, driven by the expansion of artificial intelligence technologies. If decarbonization efforts do not progress, the government estimates LNG imports could rise by 12% by 2040, reaching about 74 million tons.

The LNG Canada project marks the first new LNG venture involving Japanese companies in around six years. With global instability highlighting the need for stronger supply chains, Canada's role as a new supplier is a major win for Japan. Further expansion of production capacity is also eagerly anticipated.

The legislation eliminates a wide array of clean energy tax credits, including those supporting commercial electric vehicles, alternative fuels, EV charging infrastructure, and energy-efficient building upgrades.

Port officials said the move undercuts the agency’s ability to meet its climate goals.

“The passage of this bill makes the local fight against climate change harder, not easier,” said Port of Seattle Commission President Toshiko Hasegawa. “These credits help us decarbonize our fleet and accelerate green infrastructure investments. While this setback is deeply disappointing, we remain steadfast in our commitments.”

The bill also rescinds Environmental Protection Agency funding created under the Inflation Reduction Act, including grants the Port uses to support the transition of heavy-duty diesel trucks to electric or low-emission alternatives.

“By removing incentives for electrification and clean fuels for trucks, ships, and planes, the big bill is beyond bad for the Port’s and the nation’s ability to combat climate change and create jobs of the future,” said Commissioner Fred Felleman.

Despite its criticisms, the Port acknowledged some positive elements of the legislation, including investments in air traffic control, airport security, and Coast Guard operations that benefit Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and maritime infrastructure.

The Port says it will continue working with Washington’s congressional delegation to advocate for sustainable policies that protect air quality, public health, and long-term economic growth.",https://i0.wp.com/b-townblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/SKM-PortOfSeattleCommissionStatement25.jpg?fit=1278%2C638&ssl=1,N,,2025-07-05 20:05:44.855178

Justice today filed a new lawsuit ordering the U.S. Department of the Air Force to clean up its toxic PFAS contamination at Cannon Air Force Base near Clovis.

Earlier this year, the New Mexico Legislature delivered House Bill 140 to Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, who promptly signed it in to law. The new lawsuit relies on existing and expanded authority under the new law.

“After years of contesting responsibility, today’s lawsuit puts every one of the Air Force’s excuses to rest,” said Environment Department Secretary James Kenney. “The Air Force has spent years contesting the Environment Department’s authority as opposed to any meaningful cleanup of the toxic PFAS contamination in local drinking water sources that serve both residents and dairy farmers.”

“PFAS contamination poses a serious and long-term threat to our environment and our communities,” said Attorney General Raúl Torrez. “We are committed to using every legal tool available to hold the federal government accountable for the damage done on the base and the surrounding community and to prevent further harm from these dangerous ‘forever chemicals.’ New Mexicans deserve clean water, safe soil, and a future free from toxic exposure—

and we won’t stop fighting until they get it.”

While New Mexico has contended PFAS was subject to regulation under the Hazardous Waste Act since 2019, the USAF disagreed and filed a lawsuit against the NMED. During the last legislative session, HB 140 was introduced, explicitly designating discarded firefighting foams containing PFAS chemicals as hazardous waste, clarifying state-level regulation even when these

substances aren’t federally listed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as such.

For decades, the USAF released PFAS into the environment near Clovis, resulting in a

groundwater plume extending approximately four miles southeast of Cannon AFB. This toxic plume continues to threaten the community and resulted in the euthanizing of 3,500 dairy cows poisoned from drinking contaminated groundwater — devastating local agriculture.

In addition to cleaning up the decades of ongoing PFAS releases and paying civil penalties, the lawsuit seeks to order the USAF to:

End all use of PFAS-containing firefighting foam at Cannon for anything other than

emergency purposes

Provide water treatment systems to residents whose water has been affected by PFAS contamination

Install drinking water lines for any willing residents currently serviced by private wells in the spill area

Hold regular public meetings with the community

Install stormwater controls and retention basins to prevent offsite migration of PFAS

from contaminated media

Valuate nearby private property affected by PFAS contamination

Compensate the owners of said property for losses resulting from PFAS contamination

Analysis - Despite Elon Musk's bold predictions, the Cybertruck is, officially, a flop.

Tesla is deliberately opaque about its sales numbers on specific models, so you have to squint to get a sense of just how badly the company's unique pickup truck is performing in the real world.

But we definitely have some idea.

Here's what we know, based on Tesla's deliveries (a proxy for sales) released this week:

The EV maker delivered about 384,000 vehicles in total, world-wide, between April and June this year - a record 13.5 percent decline from a year earlier.

Zoom in, and it gets uglier for Tesla.

Tesla doesn't break out sales of the Cybertruck, one of its premium models that Musk says was inspired by the dystopian movie ""Blade Runner."" It discloses just two categories - the Model 3 and Y in one category and, in the second, ""other models,"" which is almost entirely the company's legacy Model S sedan, the Model X SUV and the Cybertruck.

The company said it delivered about 10,400 ""other"" models in the second quarter, which itself is a huge problem for Tesla. In the same quarter last year, Tesla sold more than 21,500 ""other"" models.

It's hard to think of another word for a 52 percent decline other than a collapse.

How many of those ""others"" are Cybertrucks, and how many are the Model S or X? That's not entirely clear.

But let's look at the first three months of this year. Tesla sold about 12,900 ""other"" models, of which 7100 were Cybertrucks, according to registration data from S&P Global Mobility. So a bit more than half.

It'd be safe to estimate, then, that Tesla likely sold something in the ballpark of 5000-6000 Cybertrucks in the second quarter if consumer trends held steady. It might even be getting marginally outsold by the F-150 Lightning and GM's electric pickups, rivals whose sales are also falling but weren't nearly as hyped as Musk's brainchild.

The company didn't respond to a request for comment.

But even in a hypothetical world where all of those 10,400 deliveries in the second quarter were Cybertrucks, Tesla would still be massively underperforming the expectations set by Musk, who told investors two years ago that he expected Tesla to be churning out 250,000 a year by 2025.

We're halfway through the year, and Tesla has barely hit a fraction of that.

Cybertruck sales have faced a number of challenges:

Its $80,000-$100,000 price tag

The imminent erasure of EV tax credits

Its oddball design

Repeated recalls, including one for an exterior steel panel falling off while the truck is moving

The roughly 200-mile (322km) real-world range reported by owners, rather than the 500-mile (805km) range that was initially promised

The vehicle's intractable affiliation with the world's wealthiest wannabe-oligarch

Will the Cybertruck's shortcomings sink Tesla? Probably not. But the stumble has become a reflection of the company's broader turmoil.

The electric truck faces serious competition from the likes of Rivian, Ford and GM. Chinese rivals are eating into Tesla's market share in key markets overseas, particularly Europe and China.

Tesla is on the verge of losing its title as the world's largest EV maker by annual sales to Chinese automaker BYD.

This week, BYD - which isn't allowed in the US market - reported 1 million electric vehicles sold in the first half of this year, putting it far ahead of Tesla's year-to-date total of about 721,000.

The Tesla faithful on Wall Street are still all-in on Musk, whom they see as a visionary and, perhaps more to the point, a showman who has made them rich.

Tesla's stock (TSLA) is down about 17 percent this year, but it's up nearly 300 percent over the last five years. For the ride-or-die bulls, it may not matter that Musk's MAGA turn has clobbered the company's core business of selling cars because he has convinced them that Tesla's future lies in an AI-powered, driverless utopia.

And it's Musk's history of promises that have driven that meteoric share price increase, and, accordingly, Musk's personal wealth.

But Musk's promises and predictions routinely come up short. His Cybertruck is only the latest example.",https://media.rnztools.nz/rnz/image/upload/s--Gza3t2Uy--/t_tohu-badge-facebook/v1751753835/4K4P3FD_AFP__20250605__2218821881__v1__HighRes__TeslaSharesDropOver10AfterMayRally_jpg?_a=BACCd2AD,N,,2025-07-05 19:06:03.730943

Good Saturday morning. This is Garrett Ross in the saddle. Get in touch.

DEVASTATING DEVELOPING STORY: “Desperate search for two dozen missing girls from summer camp after Texas floods kill at least 24,” by AP: “Crews searched through the dark early Saturday for two dozen children from a girls’ camp and many others who were still missing after a wall of water rushed down a river in the Texas Hill Country during a powerful storm that killed at least 24 people. The death toll was certain to rise. … The danger was not over as more heavy rains were expected Saturday and flash flood warnings and watches remained in effect for parts of central Texas.”

DRIVING THE DAY

MAKING IT MEGALAW: President Donald Trump signed the sprawling megabill designed to jumpstart his domestic policy agenda into law in a July Fourth ceremony at the White House yesterday.

The scene at 1600 Penn: “Flanked by Republican legislators and members of his Cabinet, Trump signed the multitrillion-dollar legislation outside the White House, and then banged down the gavel that House Speaker Mike Johnson gifted him that was used during the bill’s final passage Thursday,” AP’s Darlene Superville and colleagues write. “The White House was hung with red, white and blue bunting for the Independence Day festivities. The U.S. Marine Band played patriotic marches — and, in a typical Trumpian touch, tunes by 1980s pop icons Chaka Khan and Huey Lewis. There were three separate flyovers.”

What Trump said: “America’s winning, winning, winning like never before,” the president said, also referencing the recent strikes against Iran. “Promises made, promises kept, and we’ve kept them.”

FIRST IN PLAYBOOK — Here we go again: If the dramatic votes in the House and Senate this week marked the end of a monthslong process of negotiation, infighting and compromise, it also started the clock ticking down the days before Congress has to do it all over again, POLITICO’s Benjamin Guggenheim writes this morning.

Cliff jumping: “That’s because the super-sized domestic policy legislation includes a sharp cliff for tax cuts and deep safety-net restrictions — teeing them up to be the subject of fierce political battles in the 2026 midterms and the 2028 presidential election. The most politically explosive cuts to Medicaid and the nation’s largest food program, for instance, are set to take effect in 2028. Meanwhile, Trump’s most popular tax cuts and a key deduction prized by blue-state Republicans are set to sunset in 2028 and 2029, respectively.”

In a pinch: Maine Sen. Susan Collins and Pennsylvania Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick are the only two Republicans who voted against the bill that are currently top targets for Democrats in 2026. But the structure of the legislation “ensures that the most politically perilous provisions in the bill will remain a hot potato — and an opportunity for moderates — for years to come,” Benjamin writes.

And beyond: The benefit cuts could crop up in the 2028 presidential race, too, when VP JD Vance, who cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate and is seen as a key salesman for it, will likely be vying for the presidency. “Meanwhile, lawmakers in virtually every state will face pressure in 2028 as provisions kick in requiring most states to shoulder part of the costs of federal food aid for the first time.”

BURIED IN THE BILL: POLITICO’s Brian Faler ticks through the series of special tax breaks — costing tens of billions of dollars — that quietly caught a ride on Republicans’ sprawling megabill. Included are carveouts for venture capitalists, Alaskan fisheries, spaceports, private schools, rum makers and others.

“The legislation is primarily designed to prevent $4 trillion in looming tax increases set to hit at the end of this year. But, shortly before approving the plan, Senate Republicans added a new crop of unrelated, bespoke tax breaks. House GOP lawmakers got in their share, too. Many are the sort of narrowly targeted breaks Republicans have long complained are unfair, reward influential special interests and unnecessarily complicate the tax code.”

On immigration: The new law delivers the White House $170 billion for border and immigration enforcement. Now, the timer to spend it all has started, POLITICO’s Myah Ward writes. “The Trump administration has three-and-a-half years to drastically expand the nation’s border enforcement and deportation infrastructure, a massive logistical challenge for which there is no easy comparison.”

And the Trump administration knows it has a major lift ahead of it. “Look, this isn’t easy. Ten thousand ICE officers? Never happened before,” border czar Tom Homan told Myah. “But I’ll say this: It’s about time … with more money, we can do more.”

THE RESPONSE: The general consensus from blue state governors and lawmakers boils down to: Sit tight for now and blame Republicans, POLITICO’s Natalie Fertig reports. “Congress’ Medicaid cuts came as dozens of state legislatures dried the ink on their own annual budgets and adjourned — some for the summer, many for the year. But in the face of a funding chasm no state can bridge, uncertainty over the effects of the cuts and the view that Republicans will take the lion’s share of the blame, many blue states are opting to wait and see before trying to solve a problem they didn’t create.”

The real-world impact: With the bill now signed into law, state governments are already “bracing for impact as Washington shifts much of the burden for health care, food assistance and other programs onto them,” NYT’s David Chen and Pooja Salhotra report.

“Even before the bill’s final passage, state capitals were contending with a slowing economy and federal spending cuts implemented by the Department of Government Efficiency run by Elon Musk. Now they will be expected to administer complex new work requirements for Medicaid and food aid; rework some state health insurance exchanges under the Affordable Care Act; and decide how much they can do to keep their citizens insured and fed once they start losing federal assistance.”

THE REALITY CHECK: Despite Trump’s insistence that he’s ushering in an era of success that hasn’t been seen in “decades,” as he said at the White House yesterday, there are plenty of signs that — much like the cliffs built into his coveted new law — there is uncertain terrain on the horizon.

On the megabill: Passing the megabill was the hard part. Now comes the other hard part: Selling it to an American public. Despite the months of debate inside the beltway, voters are still deeply unfamiliar with everything that’s in the new law and how it will impact communities across the country, WSJ’s Aaron Zitner and colleagues report.

“Polls show that the bill is unpopular. Opposition outweighed support by more than 20 percentage points in recent Fox News and Quinnipiac University polls. Some Republican lawmakers facing tough races next year represent the most Medicaid-reliant districts. They will have to defend the big cuts in the bill to Medicaid, the health-insurance program for low-income and disabled people, as well as to rural hospitals and to nutrition assistance, once known as food stamps. Those cuts help fund tax cuts in the bill that President Trump called for during the 2024 campaign.”

On the economy: Though there have been some gains (and wins for Trump) in recent economic readings, the long-term view is still extremely unclear, WaPo’s Rachel Lerman reports.

“Gross domestic product shrank in the first quarter of the year in part because of surging imports, and consumers are feeling hesitant and spending less. It’s also too soon to know the full effect of Trump’s widespread tariffs, especially with a deadline approaching to get deals completed with many countries before levies rise once more. And as immigrants leave the workforce, either voluntarily or by deportation, a lack of workers could create labor shortages in certain key areas and fuel wage inflation.”

TURNING ATTENTION: A handful of top Trump officials will be on the Sunday show circuit tomorrow to talk up the new megalaw and the economy. Their messaging will come as we enter a week that is likely to be dominated with headlines regarding Trump’s trade agenda as he tries to secure more deals with major trading partners ahead of his July 9 deadline, when his so-called reciprocal tariffs are set to snap back into effect. Wall Street is warily watching, Reuters notes.

If it seems like there’s little to show from the White House on the trade front thus far, that’s not worrying those inside the administration. Just last week, Trump said “we can do whatever we want” regarding the looming deadline. That ambivalence has been a hallmark of negotiations, POLITICO’s Daniel Desrochers and Megan Messerly write. “And it highlights an important tension of Trump’s second administration: The president’s long-standing affinity for imposing tariffs is clashing with his reputation as a canny dealmaker.”

The scramble: “Foreign officials, trade experts, lawmakers and even some White House allies have expressed a nihilistic view of the July deadline, questioning whether a deal with the Trump administration means anything at all given the president’s penchant for using tariffs as leverage to get his way.”

Quite the quote: “Trump knows the most interesting part of his presidency is the tariff conversation,” a person close to the White House told Daniel and Megan. “I find it hard to believe he’s going to surrender it that easily. It’s all fake. There’s no deadline. It’s a self-imposed landmark in this theatrical show, and that’s where we are.”

9 THINGS THAT STUCK WITH US

1. KICKIN’ IT: For all of Trump’s “America First” rhetoric, there is at least one playing field where that message doesn’t translate, POLITICO’s Sophia Cai reports. As the U.S. prepares to play host to the 2026 World Cup, the administration’s efforts offer “a vision of an alternate Trump administration.” It’s a natural posture for Trump, who “has long gravitated personally to the testosterone and glitz of athletic competition.”

How it’s playing: “The White House welcomes foreign visitors and maintains harmonious relations with neighboring countries. It works closely with international organizations and serves as a supportive, even solicitous, partner to leaders in Democratic-run states and cities. It is an exception to ‘America First’ large enough to kick a ball through.” Andrew Giuliani, who leads a task force on World Cup preparations, told Sophia that the “largest World Cup in history will be both secure and welcoming,” adding that the U.S. will be “proud to open our doors to fans from around the world and one of the goals of the task force is to ensure that international fans can be a part of this historic sporting event.”

2. IMMIGRATION FILES: The Trump administration has deported eight men to South Sudan today, CBS’ Camilo Montoya-Galvez reports. A federal judge late yesterday blocked a last-ditch effort to keep the men in Djibouti, POLITICO’s Josh Gerstein and Kyle Cheney write, as U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy ruled the Supreme Court already had the final say. Also yesterday, a six year old Honduran boy sick with leukemia who was arrested in May and held in an ICE detention center in Texas is now back in Los Angeles, NBC’s Corky Siemaszko writes.

The big picture: Grassroots immigrant rights organizations are only growing across the country, predominantly in LA, NYT’s Jazmine Ulloa and Miriam Jordan report. “We are not trying to use violence,” said Ron Gochez, the leader of one such group, “but what is happening to our community is completely violent.”

3. RUSSIA-UKRAINE LATEST: Trump held a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy yesterday, which Zelenskyy described as a “very important and fruitful conversation.” But securing a ceasefire appears to still be out of reach as Russia continues to spurn negotiations to end the war. “We talked about different things. We had a very good call, I think a very strategic call,” Trump said. Zelenskyy’s readout of the call said the leaders discussed Ukraine’s air defense, Friday’s attacks and “mutual procurement and investment.” More from POLITICO’s Gigi Ewing

Still unclear: The state of air defense missiles. Zelenskyy’s readout said the leaders “agreed to work on increasing the protection of Ukrainian skies” but didn’t specify beyond that, NYT’s Andrew Kramer reports from Kyiv. But Bloomberg’s Michael Nienaber reported yesterday that Germany is in talks with the US to get Ukraine two more Patriot air-defense systems. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte is calling for U.S. “flexibility” to make sure Ukraine can continue to fight back, Bloomberg’s Andrea Palasciano writes.

On the ground: Putin’s offensive push continues. Russia attacked Ukraine overnight with over 300 drones, injuring 11, ABC’s Natalya Kushnir reports this morning. But Ukraine is pushing back hard, striking Russia’s “home base” for its military fighter jets earlier this AM, Bloomberg’s Olesia Safronova reports.

4. A NEW HOPE: Israeli ministers are meeting tonight on the next steps forward on a ceasefire with Gaza, NYT’s Aaron Boxerman and colleagues report. Hamas responded positively yesterday to the U.S.-backed 60-day ceasefire proposal that got Israel’s stamp of approval earlier this week, NYT’s Adam Rasgon and Ephrat Livni write. Hamas said it’s ready to start negotiations on the proposal, which includes hostage and prisoner swaps and a potential permanent end of fighting. Grain of salt: “It was not immediately clear whether Hamas was demanding any significant changes to the proposal,” per NYT.

What Trump is saying: “That’s good. They haven’t briefed me on it,” Trump said last night when asked about Hamas’ positive reaction. “There could be a Gaza deal next week,” he added, saying he’s optimistic but “it changes from day to day.” Still to come: Israel PM Benjamin Netanyahu is set to visit the White House on Monday.

5. IRAN LATEST: The UN’s nuclear inspectors left Iran yesterday after the country stopped cooperating with the international watchdog, NYT’s Erika Solomon writes, “at a particularly critical moment, when experts are warning that the attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities may simply drive the country to take its program underground.” Meanwhile, European officials are saying the U.S. strikes heavily set back Iran’s nuclear proliferation but didn’t “obliterate” it, sharing concerns that any future negotiations with Iran may have been wrecked instead, per WaPo’s Ellen Francis.

6. TIKTOK ON THE CLOCK: Trump told reporters last night that “we pretty much have a deal” to sell social media app TikTok. “We’re going to start Monday or Tuesday talking to China. … [W]e probably have to get it approved by China. Not definitely but probably,” Trump said. A deal has been in the works for months, as Chinese owner ByteDance stares down a September deadline (which Trump has repeatedly unilaterally extended) to sell the app or shut down US operations, per Reuters.

7. SCOTUS PALACE INTRIGUE: “Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson Makes Herself Heard, Prompting a Rebuke,” by NYT’s Adam Liptak: “Jackson wrote just five majority opinions in the Supreme Court term that ended last month … But her voice resonated nonetheless, in an unusually large number of concurring and dissenting opinions … Several of them warned that the court was taking lawless shortcuts, placing a judicial thumb on the scale in favor of President Trump and putting American democracy in peril. … Her opinions, sometimes joined by no other justice, have been the subject of scornful criticism from the right and have raised questions about her relationships with her fellow justices.”

8. A NEW YORK MINUTE: “Mamdani Once Claimed to Be Asian and African American. Should It Matter?” by NYT’s Dodai Stewart: “Three of his rivals in New York City’s mayoral race have strongly criticized [Zohran] Mamdani, with two suggesting potential fraud and calling for further investigation. … Right-wing pundits have flocked to social media to call Mr. Mamdani a liar — and worse. … And his supporters have rallied to his defense, angrily characterizing the disclosure as a politically motivated hit job with no bearing on the mayor’s race.”

9. MEDIAWATCH: “How Paramount’s $16-million Trump settlement came together — and could’ve fallen apart,” by the LA Times’ Meg James: “The deal resulted from months of back-and-forth among a constellation of power players with competing interests … The settlement, which the president approved late Tuesday, included a commitment by Trump to drop his claims and not sue over the May ‘60 Minutes’ broadcast … The eight-month skirmish with Trump shined a harsh light on Paramount’s vulnerabilities — and deep divisions within the company and its prospective new owners. … ‘This [settlement] was all about survival — it was that dark.’”

The Department of Environmental Protection today announced the availability of more than $5 million in grants under two new programs designed to enhance stormwater management in New Jersey’s communities, building upon the Murphy Administration’s historic commitment to climate resilience.

The grant programs are part of the Murphy Administration’s groundbreaking $20 million Ready to Be Resilient Stormwater and Resilience Funding Program, launched last year to spur modernization of stormwater infrastructure and management strategies in the face of increased precipitation resulting from a warming climate.

The DEP is making nearly $3.7 million available to help counties map existing stormwater infrastructure and for planning activities related to projects that include green infrastructure, as well as another $1.35 million in grants to promote stormwater management compliance for public entities at their wood-waste recycling and leaf-composting facilities.

“Much of New Jersey’s stormwater infrastructure is very outdated and not up to the task of managing precipitation and flooding that are increasing as a result of climate change,” said Environmental Protection Commissioner Shawn M. LaTourette. “Through these two new grant programs, the DEP continues to modernize how communities in New Jersey manage stormwater.”

Green Streets & Stormwater Infrastructure Mapping Grant Program ($3,675,000)

The DEP is making funding available to promote stormwater management and increased resilience within communities through green stormwater infrastructure (i.e., green streets) and stormwater infrastructure mapping. The source of the funding is the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.

All counties are eligible to apply. Grant funding will be divided equally among each of the counties. The minimum awarded amount is $175,000 ($75,000 for green streets and $100,000 for stormwater infrastructure mapping).

Should not all counties apply for this grant funding, the remaining funds will be added proportionately to each eligible grant applicant’s award up to a maximum total award of $350,000 ($150,000 for green streets and $200,000 for stormwater infrastructure mapping).

Funding for green street projects can be utilized for any planning activities related to green infrastructure along a county road that is located within a disadvantaged community as listed on the Environmental Justice Mapping, Assessment and Protection (EJMAP) Tool link found at https://dep.nj.gov/ej/resources/.

A completed project plan must be submitted to the DEP to receive the final disbursement of funds. Additionally, reimbursement may be sought for a previous project that meets these criteria.

Funding for stormwater infrastructure mapping can be utilized for expenses incurred to meet the municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) infrastructure map requirement of the Highway Agency MS4 permit issued to each county. A complete or partially complete MS4 infrastructure map must be submitted to the DEP to receive the final disbursement of funds.

Applicants who have already incurred costs towards completion of their stormwater infrastructure mapping may be eligible for reimbursement for incurred costs up to the amount of funding dispersed under the grant.

For detailed requirements, questions and to apply visit: https://dep.nj.gov/wlm/grants/swgrant/

Leaf Composting Grant Program ($1,350,000)

The purpose of this grant funding is to promote stormwater management compliance at wood waste recycling and leaf composting facilities. This funding will be provided to assist public entities that are authorized to operate facilities under the New Jersey Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NJDPES) Wood Waste Recycling and Leaf Composting (WRC) Stormwater General Permit.

This program, also funded by the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, applies to public facilities where clean wood waste such as branches and brush is chipped or where grass clippings, leaves, and wood chips are composted. For more information, including eligibility requirements, see wrc_final_permit.pdf

This opportunity is only open to public entities that are authorized to operate facilities under a valid WRC general permit authorization or to public applicants who qualify and apply for the WRC authorization on or before August 1, 2025. Applications for the WRC permit are available at https://dep.nj.gov/dwq/permitting_information/permits_application_forms_and_checklists/ – DST.

The DEP will distribute the available $1.35 million grant fund evenly among all qualified applicants. Should additional money become available, it will be evenly distributed to those that applied, or an additional future funding opportunity may be offered.",https://mercerme.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/stony_brook_flooding_mine_rd_pennington-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-07-05 20:06:01.845212

The legislation eliminates a wide array of clean energy tax credits, including those supporting commercial electric vehicles, alternative fuels, EV charging infrastructure, and energy-efficient building upgrades.

Port officials said the move undercuts the agency’s ability to meet its climate goals.

“The passage of this bill makes the local fight against climate change harder, not easier,” said Port of Seattle Commission President Toshiko Hasegawa. “These credits help us decarbonize our fleet and accelerate green infrastructure investments. While this setback is deeply disappointing, we remain steadfast in our commitments.”

The bill also rescinds Environmental Protection Agency funding created under the Inflation Reduction Act, including grants the Port uses to support the transition of heavy-duty diesel trucks to electric or low-emission alternatives.

“By removing incentives for electrification and clean fuels for trucks, ships, and planes, the big bill is beyond bad for the Port’s and the nation’s ability to combat climate change and create jobs of the future,” said Commissioner Fred Felleman.

Despite its criticisms, the Port acknowledged some positive elements of the legislation, including investments in air traffic control, airport security, and Coast Guard operations that benefit Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and maritime infrastructure.

The Hyundai IONIQ 6 is an electric vehicle known for its long range and high-performing battery. Despite this, the IONIQ 6 hasn't been selling well in the U.S. According to Car Scoops, sales of the EV dropped 57% in September 2024 as compared to the same month in 2023.

""Ultimately, the [IONIQ] 6 suffers for being a sedan in a crossover-crazed market,"" wrote Inside EVs.

Earlier this year, Hyundai announced the new updates to the IONIQ 6 at the Seoul Mobility Show.

""IONIQ 6 has evolved from a single Electrified Streamliner into a lineup, each model expressing its own character while staying true to one refined vision,"" said Simon Loasby, senior vice president and head of Hyundai Design Center. ""Under the evolved design concept of 'Pure Flow, Refined', we've enhanced every line and detail to make IONIQ 6 simpler and more progressive.""

Some of the new upgrades to the IONIQ 6 include a charge range of 353 miles, certified by the South Korean Ministry of Environment. As Electrek reports, this could be up to 430 miles of range based on the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) scale, which measures all global test levels of traffic patterns, fuel emissions, and more.

""Range is one thing that we know a lot of consumers care about,"" said Alex Knizek, auto testing manager at Consumer Reports. ""Charging anxiety becomes a prominent thing — a charger might be broken or maybe charging at a lower rate than advertised.""

The new mileage range of the IONIQ 6 could help alleviate that anxiety in potential EV buyers and shows the capability for upgrading EV range mileage.

The new IONIQ 6 also features an upgraded battery and built-in charging capabilities with Tesla superchargers, the largest and fastest global network of EV charging ports.

""This could be a huge stress relief by minimizing the steps involved in charging,"" wrote Inside EVs.

Some of the other enhancements in the IONIQ 6 include a refined console, easier climate control, and a redesigned steering wheel for more comfort and user experience.

Electric vehicles are becoming more common on the streets. For drivers, EVs help reduce harmful pollution from traditional gas-powered cars. And drivers can save money on fuel.

Estimates from the Department of Energy indicate that drivers can save up to $2,200 a year on fully electric vehicles and up to $1,500 on a hybrid electric vehicle. These savings can be even greater with solar panels, which can decrease the cost of charging your vehicle at home. You can find and compare solar quotes in your area with this free and easy tool from EnergySage.

EV sales have risen by 10% year-over-year. Because of the increase in demand for EVs, automakers are increasing production of hybrid and fully-electric vehicles. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), about 17.3 million EVs were made in 2024, 25% more than in 2023. Hyundai is also ramping up production of the IONIQ 6 with hopes that the new upgrades could bring in new EV drivers.

""For anyone who enjoys a good road trip and doesn't want to stop to charge, the Ioniq 6 should be the way to go,"" wrote Patrick George of Inside EVs.

“We are waiting for the projects to come forward so we can say… match the project with the money,” Justin Friedman told Anadolu Agency on the sidelines of the 11th Nuclear Power Plants Summit in Istanbul, held July 1-2.

“They are ready to go; we just need good projects to come,” he added.

Friedman said the US Export-Import Bank and the US International Development Finance Corporation have already issued letters of interest worth more than $17 billion for nuclear projects in Romania and Poland and are now looking at Türkiye.

“I know they are exploring opportunities here in Türkiye and have programs to help, particularly SMRs, move forward,” he added.

First nuclear power plant

Türkiye is building its first nuclear power plant, the four-unit Akkuyu project on the Mediterranean coast, in partnership with Russia’s state nuclear agency, Rosatom. Once fully operational, the plant is expected to supply about 10 percent of Türkiye’s electricity demand for at least 60 years.

Ankara also plans large-scale plants in Sinop on the Black Sea and in the northwestern Thrace region, targeting 20 gigawatts of installed nuclear capacity by 2050. Officials are also evaluating SMRs as part of the country’s long-term energy mix.

Friedman, who previously served as political counselor at the US Embassy in Ankara between 2014 and 2017, said there is natural potential for cooperation between US and Turkish companies in the SMR sector.

“Turkish companies already, today, are providing parts, supplies, and services for nuclear projects outside of Türkiye,” he said. “It is only natural that US companies would want to seek that expertise and take advantage of it as they explore projects here in Türkiye.”

Collaborating on nuclear energy could help 2 countries strengthen partnership, Friedman says, describing this as an “exciting time” for the global nuclear sector, noting that US President Donald Trump has set a target of adding 400 gigawatts of nuclear capacity in the US by 2050. “That is a very ambitious goal, and that is why the US is in the lead around the world,” he said.

He added that Washington sees nuclear cooperation as a key pillar of its broader strategic relationship with Ankara. “Nuclear is a piece of that. And we are hoping that by working together on the nuclear energy issue, we can extend and grow our partnership,” he said.

Friedman said the US and Türkiye are “deep friends and good partners” and expressed hope that nuclear cooperation would continue to grow. “We see indications on both sides that we want to move forward, and I am just happy to be here to be part of that,” he said.

For investors, the path forward is clear: hedge against fiscal austerity risks while preparing for political gridlock.","The sudden emergence of Elon Musk's proposed “America Party” has thrust the U.S. political system into a rare moment of instability, with implications far beyond Capitol Hill. Musk's vow to form a centrist party in response to President Donald Trump's $3.3 trillion “One Big Beautiful Bill” has exposed deep fissures in bipartisan fiscal discipline. For investors, the question is no longer whether Musk's party will succeed—but how its mere existence could upend sectors reliant on federal spending, from electric vehicles to defense contractors.

The Political Tightrope: Fiscal Austerity vs. Entrenched Spending

Musk's party is less a fully formed movement than a threat to disrupt the bipartisan consensus that has enabled decades of deficit spending. The “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which Musk opposes as fiscally irresponsible, includes expanded healthcare subsidies, infrastructure spending, and tax cuts—all funded by borrowing. Musk's counterproposal, however, remains vague, focusing narrowly on fiscal conservatism.

The party's greatest leverage may lie in its ability to splinter Republican support for Trump's agenda. A June 2025 poll by Quantus Insights found that 57% of male Republican voters would consider backing the America Party, potentially derailing the president's legislative priorities. Yet Musk's net favorability rating of -18% and legal hurdles—such as California's requirement of 75,000 registered members to qualify for the ballot—suggest the party's success is far from assured.

Sector Risks: Fiscal Austerity's Bullseye

The America Party's stated focus on reducing the national debt (now over $40 trillion) creates clear winners and losers among debt-driven industries:

Electric Vehicles (EVs):

Musk's Tesla is caught in a paradox. The bill phases out EV tax credits by 2026, which Tesla CEO Musk opposes, advocating instead for a gradual wind-down. A fiscal conservative shift could accelerate cuts to subsidies, hitting Tesla's margins. Meanwhile, EV infrastructure firms like ChargePoint, which rely less on direct subsidies, appear more resilient.

Tesla's share price has fallen 25% since the bill's House passage in July 2024, reflecting market anxiety over subsidy erosion.

Healthcare and Pharmaceuticals:

The bill's expanded Medicare benefits and drug price controls are nonstarters for fiscal hawks. A successful America Party could pressure lawmakers to scale back these provisions, reducing revenue for companies like Pfizer or UnitedHealthcare.

Defense and Aerospace:

Bipartisan support for military spending may insulate firms like Lockheed Martin, but cost-cutting in other areas (e.g., space exploration subsidies) could hurt companies tied to Musk's own ventures, such as SpaceX.

Investment Strategy: Navigating Fiscal Crosscurrents

The key variable is whether the America Party's mere existence forces gridlock that limits spending, or whether it fails, allowing the bill to proceed unimpeded. Here's how to position portfolios:

Equities:

Short Tesla (TSLA): Its valuation hinges on subsidies and high debt levels. A fiscal austerity push would amplify headwinds.

Long EV Infrastructure: Firms like ChargePoint (CHPT) or EVgo (EVGO), which benefit from secular adoption trends, are less subsidy-dependent.

Avoid High-Debt Firms: Companies with weak balance sheets (e.g., healthcare providers with high leverage) face rising financing costs if austerity reduces federal support.

Fixed Income:

Treasuries (TLT): If gridlock delays the bill, lower inflation expectations could boost bond prices.

Gold (GLD): A prolonged political stalemate might drive safe-haven demand.

Bets on Gridlock:

Consider inverse ETFs like SPP (which profits from market volatility) or options straddles on key sectors.

Political Realities: Why the Party May Stall—But Still Matter

The America Party's success faces three towering obstacles:

1. Structural Barriers: Forming a national party requires navigating 50 states' ballot access rules. For example, Ohio mandates 50,000 signatures by September 2025—no small feat for a fledgling movement.

2. Voter Loyalty: Third parties rarely succeed in a two-party system. Even Ross Perot's 19% vote share in 1992 didn't translate into lasting influence.

3. Musk's Brand: His polarizing persona—47% of Americans view him unfavorably—limits broad appeal.

Yet the party's mere existence could force fiscal discipline. Already, Senate Republicans have signaled openness to deficit-cutting measures to avoid losing seats to Musk's faction. This creates a “threat premium” for markets: even if the party fails, its leverage may curb spending, favoring sectors that thrive in leaner fiscal environments.

Conclusion: A Crossroads for Fiscal Policy—and Markets

Musk's America Party is a gamble, not a sure bet. But its emergence underscores a growing unease with debt-driven policymaking. For investors, the path forward is clear: hedge against fiscal austerity risks while preparing for political gridlock. The next six months will test whether Musk's party is a flash in the pan—or a seismic shift in U.S. fiscal priorities. Either way, the crosshairs are already on industries that depend on the government's open checkbook.",,N,,2025-07-05 18:05:09.026694

When he was in office, Biden imposed increasingly stringent emissions standards for cars and trucks.
The Transportation Department’s memorandum on June 6 said the previous administration “ignored statutory requirements” that barred consideration of EVs when setting standards.
Duffy put pressure on the federal agency earlier this year to reverse the fuel economy rules as soon as possible.
The Biden-era standards “were ‘improperly predicated’ on alternative fuel vehicles,” said John Bozzella, the group’s president and CEO.","DETROIT (AP) — Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a rule that Biden-era fuel economy standards for gas-powered cars and trucks are illegal and moved to reverse them, paving the way for a likely reset of rules.

Combined with Senate language in the pending budget bill to eliminate penalties for exceeding standards regulating how far vehicles must travel on a gallon of fuel, automakers moving forward could come under less pressure from regulators to reduce their pollution. Ultimately, the nation’s use of electric vehicles could be slowed.

The moves align with the Trump administration’s ongoing efforts to slash federal support for EVs.

President Donald Trump has pledged to end what he has called an EV “mandate,” referring incorrectly to former President Joe Biden’s target for half of all new vehicle sales to be electric by 2030. EVs do not use gasoline or emit planet-warming greenhouse gases.

No federal policy has required auto companies to sell — or car buyers to purchase — EVs, although California and other states have imposed rules requiring that all new passenger vehicles sold in the state to be zero-emission by 2035.

When he was in office, Biden imposed increasingly stringent emissions standards for cars and trucks. He included use of EVs in calculating the rules — an inclusion the Trump administration and the auto industry have argued was illegal and raised the bar too high for automakers to meet.

The Transportation Department’s memorandum on June 6 said the previous administration “ignored statutory requirements” that barred consideration of EVs when setting standards.

“We are making vehicles more affordable and easier to manufacture in the United States,” Duffy said.

The revised rule does not itself change existing standards, but it empowers the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to make adjustments in coming months.

Duffy put pressure on the federal agency earlier this year to reverse the fuel economy rules as soon as possible.

Under the Biden administration, automakers were required to average about 50 miles per gallon of gas by 2031 — up from about 39 miles per gallon for light-duty vehicles today — in an effort to save almost 70 billion gallons of gasoline through 2050.

The rules, finalized in 2024, increased fuel economy 2% per year for passenger cars in every model year from 2027 to 2031 and 2% each year for SUVs and other light trucks from 2029 to 2031.

Mileage rules — in place since the 1970s energy crisis — work alongside the Environmental Protection Agency limits on vehicle greenhouse gas emissions. Transportation accounts for the largest source of the nation’s planet-warming emissions, and cars and trucks make up more than half of those.

In recent years, automakers have been manufacturing gasoline-fueled cars that are more efficient and get higher mileage.

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents automakers, called Duffy’s announcement “a positive development” that adds “important clarity” to federal mileage rules.

The Biden-era standards “were ‘improperly predicated’ on alternative fuel vehicles,” said John Bozzella, the group’s president and CEO.

But Katherine Garcia, director of the Sierra Club’s Clean Transportation for All program, said the Transportation Department’s action will increase costs for Americans and increase pollution.

“Making our vehicles less fuel-efficient hurts families by forcing them to pay more at the pump,” she said. “It will lead to fewer clean-vehicle options for consumers, squeeze our wallets, endanger our health and increase climate pollution.”

Meanwhile, Republicans on the Senate Commerce Committee added proposed language to the pending budget bill that would remove fines penalizing automakers that don’t meet fuel economy standards with their gas-powered vehicles.

Automakers can buy regulatory credits under a trading program if they don’t meet the standards. EV makers like Tesla, which don’t rely on gasoline, earn credits that they can sell to other carmakers.

The arrangement has resulted in billions of dollars in revenue for Tesla and millions for other EV makers like Rivian.

Implications for EV Owners and Industry For EV owners, the loss of tax credits increases purchase costs, potentially making gas-powered vehicles more competitive in the short term.
Upcoming Treasury guidance on battery credits and court rulings on ZEV mandates will be critical in shaping the industry’s path.","President Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill,” slated for signing in the coming days, delivers a seismic shift to electric vehicle (EV) incentives, Zero-Emission Vehicle (ZEV) credit systems, and clean energy policies. This legislation, detailed by EV industry analyst Sawyer Merritt, reshapes the landscape for EV owners, automakers, and enthusiasts, balancing new opportunities with significant challenges.

EV Tax Credits Face a Hard Deadline

The bill terminates the $7,500 federal tax credit for new EVs and the $4,000 credit for used EVs on September 30, 2025. These credits have been pivotal in making vehicles like the Tesla Model Y or Nissan Leaf more affordable, often reducing upfront costs by thousands. For perspective, the $7,500 credit could cover roughly 10% of a $75,000 Rivian R1S or nearly 20% of a $40,000 Chevrolet Bolt. After September 2025, buyers will bear the full cost, potentially slowing EV adoption, especially among middle-income households. Notably, earlier concerns about a $250 annual EV fee are dispelled, as the bill contains no such provision, offering relief to current and prospective owners.

ZEV Credit Market on the Brink

The ZEV credit system, a financial lifeline for EV manufacturers like Tesla, faces a near-total collapse under the new law. Previously, automakers failing to meet federal Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards faced hefty fines, incentivizing them to buy ZEV credits from companies producing EVs. The bill eliminates these penalties, reducing fines to $0, which Sawyer Merritt notes “removes a major incentive to purchase credits.”

Compounding this, Congress recently used the Congressional Review Act to revoke EPA waivers that allowed California and 17 other states to enforce stricter emissions rules, including ZEV mandates. “Without these waivers, states can no longer require automakers to meet ZEV sales targets or buy ZEV credits to comply,” Merritt explains. These waivers underpinned state-level ZEV programs, creating a robust market where Tesla earned billions by selling credits to legacy automakers like Ford or GM. With both federal and state compliance pressures gone, demand for ZEV credits in the U.S. is likely to plummet, though Tesla can still generate credits in markets like Europe. Legal battles to restore the waivers are expected, but their outcome remains uncertain.

Battery Manufacturing Credits: A Mixed Bag

The bill preserves the 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit, providing $35 per kilowatt-hour for battery cells and $10 per kilowatt-hour for modules. This supports domestic production at facilities like Tesla’s Giga Nevada (in partnership with Panasonic), Giga Texas, and the new Nevada LFP battery plant. For example, a 100 kWh battery pack could yield a $4,500 credit ($3,500 for cells + $1,000 for modules), bolstering U.S. manufacturing. However, new sourcing restrictions complicate eligibility. Batteries must contain 60% U.S. content in 2026, increasing to 85% by 2030. Merritt cautions, “If the plant uses CATL equipment, it will be tough,” highlighting challenges for facilities reliant on Chinese technology. The U.S. Treasury is expected to issue guidance clarifying these requirements, which could ease compliance concerns for manufacturers.

New Deduction for U.S.-Made Vehicles

A novel tax deduction allows buyers of American-assembled vehicles to deduct up to $10,000 annually in loan interest from 2025 to 2028. Eligible vehicles, including EVs, must have final assembly in the U.S., a gross vehicle weight under 14,000 pounds (6,350 kilograms), and be cars, SUVs, pickups, minivans, vans, or motorcycles. Models like the Ford F-150 Lightning or Lucid Air qualify, but the deduction phases out for single filers earning over $100,000 or joint filers above $200,000. For a $50,000 loan at 5% interest, this could save buyers roughly $2,500 annually, making U.S.-built EVs more attractive despite the loss of tax credits.

Broader Clean Energy Rollbacks

Beyond EVs, the bill curtails clean energy incentives, impacting the broader transition to sustainable technologies. The 30% tax credit for rooftop solar ends December 31, 2025, potentially increasing installation costs by thousands (e.g., a $20,000 solar system loses $6,000 in savings). Tax credits for geothermal heat pumps, energy-efficient home improvements, and new energy-efficient homes also expire by mid-2026. The Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit, which supports EV charging infrastructure, ends June 30, 2026, potentially slowing the expansion of public charging networks. For instance, installing a Level 2 charger (costing $500–$2,000) will lose up to 30% in federal support.

The bill also phases out clean electricity production and investment credits for wind and solar projects entering service after 2027, a blow to renewable energy. Projects must begin construction within a year of enactment or come online by 2027 to qualify. New restrictions disqualify facilities using components from China, complicating supply chains. Nuclear, geothermal, and battery storage projects have more time, but the overall reduction in clean energy support could hinder U.S. progress toward carbon neutrality.

Implications for EV Owners and Industry

For EV owners, the loss of tax credits increases purchase costs, potentially making gas-powered vehicles more competitive in the short term. A Tesla Model 3 Long Range, priced around $47,000, loses $7,500 in savings post-2025, pushing the effective cost to $54,500. This could deter budget-conscious buyers, slowing EV market growth. However, the loan interest deduction and retained battery manufacturing credits offer some relief, particularly for those buying U.S.-built models.

For automakers, the collapse of the ZEV credit market disrupts revenue streams, especially for Tesla, which reported $1.79 billion in regulatory credit revenue in 2024. Companies may scale back EV production if demand weakens, focusing instead on hybrids or internal combustion engine vehicles. The battery credit’s domestic sourcing rules incentivize U.S. manufacturing but risk supply chain bottlenecks if foreign components are phased out too quickly. Regulatory uncertainty, particularly around ZEV mandate litigation, complicates long-term planning.

Economically, the bill aligns with domestic manufacturing goals, potentially creating jobs in battery and vehicle production. However, reduced clean energy incentives could cede ground to countries like China, which dominates global EV and solar markets. Operationally, EV owners may face challenges if charging infrastructure growth slows due to the loss of refueling credits, particularly in rural areas where stations are sparse.

Looking Ahead: Navigating a New Era

EV owners and enthusiasts must act swiftly to leverage remaining incentives. Those planning to buy should aim for purchases before September 2025 to secure tax credits. Businesses leasing EVs lose their commercial clean vehicle credit on the same date, potentially raising lease costs. The shift toward U.S.-centric policies offers opportunities for domestic manufacturers but risks stalling the broader EV ecosystem. Upcoming Treasury guidance on battery credits and court rulings on ZEV mandates will be critical in shaping the industry’s path.

The bill reflects a pivot away from federal support for electrification, prioritizing economic nationalism over environmental goals. While EV adoption will continue, driven by state policies and private innovation, the road ahead is bumpier. Owners and automakers alike must adapt to a landscape with fewer subsidies but new opportunities for American-made vehicles.",https://evxl.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-4.jpg,N,,2025-07-05 18:05:16.839562

As courts and policymakers weigh competing interests, investors face a critical question: Can this $6 billion project, pivotal to Maryland's clean energy goals, withstand the legal and political headwinds it faces?

The Legal Battlefield: Five Claims That Could Sink or Save the Project

On July 2, 2025, a federal court handed a partial victory to Ocean City and its allies by allowing five major legal claims to proceed against US Wind's project. The lawsuit, filed under the Endangered Species Act, National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, Marine Mammal Protection Act, and National Historic Preservation Act, accuses the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) of failing to adequately assess environmental risks. At the center of the dispute is the potential harm to endangered North Atlantic Right Whales, whose migration routes could be disrupted by turbine construction.

The plaintiffs argue that BOEM's approval process ignored these risks, while US Wind and the state of Maryland counter that rigorous environmental reviews—including seasonal construction bans and real-time acoustic monitoring—mitigate harm. A trial outcome could delay or even invalidate the project's federal permits, which were finalized in December 2024.

Political Crosswinds: Federal Policy and State-Specific Conflicts

The project's viability hinges not only on courtroom outcomes but also on shifting federal priorities. President Donald Trump's January 2025 executive order pausing offshore wind lease sales and permitting has cast doubt on the timeline. The administration argues that the pause is necessary to reassess environmental and economic impacts, but critics—including 17 states, including Maryland—see it as a politically motivated blow to renewable energy progress.

Meanwhile, Delaware's Sussex County adds another layer of uncertainty. The county denied a permit for a critical onshore substation in 2023, but state lawmakers are pushing legislation to strip local authorities of their permitting power. If passed, this would clear a path for US Wind's infrastructure but risk further alienating coastal communities already skeptical of the project's benefits.

Investment Implications: Navigating Risk and Reward

For investors, the Maryland project exemplifies the high-stakes calculus of renewable energy investments. On one hand, the project's success would deliver 2,200 MW of clean energy, fulfilling 40% of Maryland's 2035 clean energy mandate and creating 2,600 jobs. US Wind's partnerships with local manufacturers, such as a $150 million monopile plant in Sparrows Point, also underscore its economic multiplier effect.

On the other hand, the risks are acute. A prolonged legal battle or federal policy reversal could delay the project's 2029 commercial operations date, increasing costs and diluting returns. Equity investors in US Wind's parent company, Renexia, have already faced volatility tied to permit delays and regulatory uncertainty.

Investment Advice:

- Short-Term Holders: Avoid direct exposure to US Wind/Renexia until legal and regulatory risks crystallize. Monitor the July 14, 2025, judicial review deadline and the Delaware substation bill's progress.

- Long-Term Plays: Consider broader renewable energy ETFs (e.g., ICLN) or utilities with diversified portfolios (e.g., NextEra Energy (NEE)) to mitigate project-specific risk.

- Policy Watchers: Track federal litigation over Trump's executive order; a court rebuke could reignite investor confidence in offshore wind.

Conclusion: A Litmus Test for Clean Energy's Future

The Ocean City project is more than a single investment opportunity—it's a test of whether the U.S. can balance climate goals with local autonomy. Investors must weigh the project's potential to deliver on decarbonization against the real risks of regulatory and legal setbacks. For now, patience and diversification remain the safest strategies.

The next 12 months will be decisive. If US Wind can navigate the courts and Delaware's politics while federal permitting rules stabilize, this project could become a blueprint for offshore wind's expansion. Fail, and it may deter capital from similarly contentious coastal developments. The offshore wind sector's growth hinges on resolving these crosscurrents—and investors would do well to watch closely.",,N,,2025-07-06 06:02:20.794382

Days earlier, the federal climate website, climate.gov, disappeared.
With or without federal support, Vermont will begin its third Climate Action Plan in 2028, with a new publication planned for July 1, 2029.","On Tuesday, as the federal government continued its unprecedented attack on clean energy and climate funding, Vermont’s Climate Council published its 2025 Climate Action Plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote resiliency in the state.

The plan is a requirement set by the 2020 Global Warming Solutions Act to publish a new framework every four years for tackling the climate crisis. The 2025 plan could guide legislative action on helping Vermonters, especially those with low or moderate incomes, adopt more efficient and less polluting sources of home heat and transportation, the two highest-emitting sectors in the state.

Other priorities included mitigating future climate hazards, building a climate-ready workforce, weatherizing an additional 79,000 homes, reducing or sequestering emissions on farmland and finding funding to implement all these ideas.

While Vermont files its second Climate Action Plan to try and meet legally-binding emissions reductions, federal funding programs that made possible climate initiatives in small states like this one are on the chopping block. Now, as the state looks for other sources of revenue and support to achieve its climate goals, the new plan lays out what Vermonters might see prioritized in the coming years. But with reduced political will in the last legislative session to proactively deal with climate change, it remains to be seen whether those plans are fiscally realistic under a governor who prioritizes short-term affordability over long-term resiliency.

“Before focusing too much on a new, shiny thing, we should really be thinking about how we maintain the current pace and level of effort,” said Julie Moore, Agency of Natural Resources secretary and a member of the Climate Council who voted for the plan. “Maintaining our current pace is far from certain in this moment.”

The state’s initial Climate Action Plan preceded devastating floods that wrecked homes and businesses along Vermont’s river valleys in 2023 and 2024. As the atmosphere warms, holding more moisture, precipitation in Vermont has become heavier and more frequent, causing deluges that can lead to deadly floods.

Climate change, largely driven by the burning of fossil fuels, has also brought increased high heat days that most homes in Vermont are ill-equipped to handle. Wildland fires have become more common and air quality has diminished in the warmer months as enormous wildfires burn elsewhere, according to the plan.

But even with the tangible effects of climate change in Vermont, state lawmakers’ attempts to significantly reduce emissions along outlines from the 2021 Climate Action Plan have failed to meet state emissions targets. Big proposals like the clean heat standard were shelved during the spring legislative session, and the state likely missed its 2025 emissions-reduction target required by the Global Warming Solutions Act. A court case currently playing out in Montpelier could help determine whether the state missed that target.

Now, as the state looks for more guidance on how to lower its emissions, the federal government could squeeze Vermont further as the Trump administration eviscerates clean energy funding and advances in climate science prioritized under President Biden. The 2025 Climate Action Plan recognized the impact of federal cuts, noting that the work to combat climate change was not about to get easier.

What’s in the plan?

The Global Warming Solutions Act binds the state to lower greenhouse gas emissions by milestones set in state statute: 26% below 2005 emissions levels by 2025, 40% below 1990 levels by 2030, and 80% below 1990 levels by 2050.

The Climate Action Plan outlines pathways to reach those goals every four years, through Climate Council planning meetings, technical analysis with consultants, and community input. More than 1,000 Vermonters and Vermont-based organizations participated in creating the plan, including 850 who joined virtual and in-person meetings and 250 who submitted public comments, according to the plan.

But even with four years of planning, Vermont is still behind its legally-binding goals. While the state initially claimed that it reached that first milestone on Jan. 1, 2025, a report by the Energy Action Network, a Vermont-based collective of energy nonprofits, instead found Vermont to have fallen up to 39% short of the emissions reduction required by law.

Moore’s agency reviewed the report and has agreed that the state was unlikely to achieve the 2025 goal, but final datasets to assess emissions won’t be available until 2027.

Previous ambitious reductions programs like the clean heat standard were shelved after a campaign by out-of-state fuel lobbyists along with Gov. Phil Scott’s rejection of the plan as unaffordable. State regulators found costs associated with the program were too high, but some members of the Climate Council disagree with those fiscal priorities.

“When we have a conversation on benefits and costs, we can’t lose sight of the cost of the status quo, which is already too high,” said Jared Duval, one of the 23 state-appointed members of the Climate Council. He quoted numbers from the state tax department that found about $2 billion a year was spent on fossil fuels for transportation and heating in 2024. An economic analysis done for the Climate Action Plan identified a potential $6 billion in costs that could be avoided by 2050 if the state pursued emissions reductions recommendations, Duval said.

With the lapse in federal funding, Duval said that in order to reduce emissions, the state would need to return to the polluter-pays principle, where fossil fuel corporations are responsible for paying for climate damages and resiliency efforts. This principle doesn’t only apply to the state’s legal battle with fossil fuel corporations in the climate superfund law, Duval said. It also stands as the rationale behind ambitious programs like the clean heat standard and the cap-and-invest model, which the climate action plan asked the state to research this year.

“The cost of those policies has always been designed to apply to importers of fossil fuels to Vermont,” Duval said. While fuel companies have said those costs will be passed onto customers, Duval said a key difference between the clean heat standard, pursued through the 2021 climate action plan, and the cap-and-invest model, again pushed forward by the 2025 plan, is that cap-and-invest can provide direct payments to Vermonters through rebates, based on their income.

Duval, along with 15 others, voted for the 2025 plan. Two councillors were not present to vote, and five voted against it, including Sarah Clark, the Agency of Administration secretary; Anson Tebbetts, the Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets secretary; Michele Boomhower on behalf of Joe Flynn, the Agency of Transportation secretary; Lindsay Kurrle, Agency of Commerce and Community Development secretary; and Matt Cota, owner of Meadow Hill Consulting and representing the fuel sector. All except for Cota are in Gov. Scott’s administration and report to the governor, who has worked to overturn the legal requirements in the Global Warming Solutions Act.

Others were reluctant with their yes votes. While Moore, secretary of the Agency of Natural Resources,, voted for the plan, she said that decision was mainly a reflection of her appreciation of the work of state government staff. Moore said she continues to have “some real concerns.”

“Specifically, I’m concerned about what it will take to operationalize the plan’s vision,” Moore said. “It’s sort of left up to interpretation.”

The Conservation Law Foundation, which sued the state last year claiming the Agency of Natural Resources failed to properly prepare to meet the 2025 emissions goal, called the 2025 Climate Action Plan “toothless” in a statement on Tuesday.

“The Council has worked hard to come to a consensus and deliver recommendations that include financial incentives to drive down emissions,” said Elena Mihaly, the foundation’s vice president for Vermont. “But it has failed to put in place real, enforceable policies that demand major polluters do their part too.”

The return of cap-and-invest

Much of the council’s attention this last year has been on a cap-and-invest program to reduce climate pollution. Cap-and-invest programs place a declining cap on greenhouse gas emissions, according to the state, while reinvesting the proceeds to climate-friendly projects like energy efficiency and weatherization. In March, Mike Pieciak, Vermont state treasurer, spoke to the council during a special session on cap-and-invest, reminding members that of the billions the state spends on fossil fuels, “over 75% of those dollars flow out of the state.”

But a cap-and-invest model could keep more money in the state and create up to 810 jobs, according to Pieciak, especially if the state were to partner with cap-and-invest initiatives already underway such as the Western Climate Initiative, which includes California, Quebec and Washington, and the cap-and-invest program in New York state. A modified clean heat standard could complement this program, according to the 2025 Climate Action Plan, focusing on the electrification of air and water heating in low- and moderate-income households.

Such a partnership could avoid problems that Vermont encountered while pursuing a clean heat standard, the council’s previous plan to reduce thermal emissions. In a January report, the Public Utility Commission, which studied the clean heat program, told lawmakers that it would likely be too expensive for the state to take on a first-of-its-kind credit market on its own.

But this isn’t the first time cap-and-invest has been studied. Over the last four years, the Legislature asked the agency, under guidance from the 2021 Climate Action Plan, to dig into both the clean heat standard and the cap-and-invest program.

“We’re a little bit taken aback by the price tag associated with each one, along with the administrative complexity,” Moore said. “I’m hopeful that there will be an opportunity for conversation about both what we can do with existing resources.”

Moore said the cap-and-invest program could only work if Vermont joins a multi-state program, and the only one that currently exists – the Western Climate Initiative – has indicated they’re not accepting new members, she said. New York’s plan for cap-and-invest, which could be a better fit as a neighboring state, is not yet operational. Instead, Moore said, the state should focus on more actionable items like continuing to weatherize homes as federal funding disappears.

“It’s absolutely important to acknowledge long term savings associated with these practices, but you can’t gloss over the fact that there are real and significant upfront costs,” Moore said. “Figuring out how to pay for this work to generate long-term savings is fundamental, and the climate plan, I feel, doesn’t give enough treatment to that issue.”

Richard Cowart, the former chair of the Public Utility Commission and a member of the Climate Council, said the 2025 plan did a good job marrying provisions that can help communities become more resilient against the impacts of climate change alongside measures to reduce carbon emissions, while also saving the state money.

“The notion that addressing climate change has to be viewed simply as a burden is incorrect,” Cowart said, noting that instead the state’s economy could benefit from doing its part to slow the warming world. “How can we afford to continue to spend $2 billion a year to import fossil fuels that we know that we shouldn’t actually be burning?”

He pointed to Efficiency Vermont as an example of how the state has invested in efficiency, saved money, and provided environmental and health benefits. The 2025 plan builds on that experience, he said, and shows that the state doesn’t require federal money to build important programs like the first-of-its-kind utility launched a quarter century ago.

“We did not need federal money to launch Efficiency Vermont, instead we made our own decision to reduce bills for Vermonters,” Cowart said. “We can and need to do the same thing with respect to our ongoing fossil fuel bills.”

Federal funding cuts

But how the state will pay for myriad programs and strategies the 2025 plan puts forward appears to be the crux of the climate debate in Vermont, as the arguments over affordability continue.

On the federal level, the attack on climate action has never been more brutal. For months, the Trump administration has worked to gut billions of dollars in renewable energy incentives and subsidies for proven initiatives like buying electric vehicles and scaling up charging infrastructure, increasing financial access to heat pumps and solar panels, and supporting big-budget projects like green hydrogen and wind energy.

“The cost of electricity to the people you represent and the folks I represent in Vermont is going up,” said U.S. Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., directing the remark toward President Trump.

On Friday, Senate Republicans announced a new axe to clean energy: In the Trump administration’s budget overhaul called the One Big Beautiful Bill, the Senate suggested not only cutting federal funding for renewables but taxing those projects.

The proposal would have penalized solar and wind projects if they sourced materials from countries the Trump administration has a strained relationship with , including China, which dominates the world in clean energy production and materials. The North America’s Building Trades Unions called it “the biggest job-killing bill in the history of this country” and equated it to “terminating more than 1,000 Keystone XL pipeline projects.”

On Tuesday afternoon, the Senate passed the budget reconciliation bill, all but ensuring that Trump’s agenda will go into effect later this summer. But the tax was removed before Vice President J.D. Vance casted the tie-breaking vote as three GOP Senators – Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Sen. Tim Tillis of North Carolina and Sen. Susan Collins of Maine – broke with their party and voted against the bill.

The bill now moves for a vote in the House.

“In Vermont and across the country, this bill will kill jobs, raise energy prices and move us in exactly the wrong direction in the fight against climate change,” U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., told VTDigger in an email on Monday before the vote. “It will keep our country hooked on dirty and expensive fossil fuels by creating enormous new handouts for the very industry that is destroying the planet in pursuit of massive profits.”

Increasing frequency and severity of disasters have also taken the toll in Vermont: Since 1953, out of the 62 federally declared disasters in the state, half have occurred since 2011.

The analysis of these disasters was included in the 2025 plan, but the Federal Emergency Management Agency tool that outlined those disasters was taken down by FEMA on June 30, the day before the report was published. Days earlier, the federal climate website, climate.gov, disappeared.

The web address now redirects users to the climate webpage of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the federal government’s premier climate science agency currently facing severe staffing and funding cuts. The country’s sixth National Climate Assessment, which provides essential data for state and regional reports like this one, was shelved this spring when scientists were told to stop their work.

With or without federal support, Vermont will begin its third Climate Action Plan in 2028, with a new publication planned for July 1, 2029.

It recently became more difficult to understand what the regional Northeast climate will be like at that time: The fifth National Climate Assessment, which was published in 2023, is no longer available on the federal website.

While smaller, affordable EVs are thriving, high-end electric cars from established luxury brands are struggling to gain traction. Despite their advanced features and prestigious badges, these premium models face significant challenges in today’s dynamic automotive landscape. With production setbacks, dwindling sales, and shifting consumer preferences, the luxury EV segment finds itself at a crossroads. What are the underlying factors behind this trend, and how might these brands adapt to the changing tides?

The Struggles of Luxury Electric Vehicles

Recent developments in the automotive industry highlight the difficulties faced by luxury electric vehicles. Brands like Mercedes, Ferrari, and Porsche are encountering significant challenges in their EV endeavors. The highly anticipated Mercedes G-Class SUV, for instance, has seen dismal sales. Similarly, Ferrari has delayed the release of its second electric model due to weak demand. Porsche, known for its performance-oriented vehicles, has experienced soft sales of its electric Macan SUV and Taycan models. These setbacks underscore a broader trend: the struggle of high-end electric cars to capture consumer interest.

Several factors contribute to this phenomenon. First, the high price tags of luxury EVs, often exceeding $100,000, deter many potential buyers. The depreciation of these vehicles is another concern, with some models losing value at an alarming rate. Moreover, the technical demands of large premium EVs, such as their need for sizable batteries, further inflate costs. As a result, consumers increasingly opt for traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles or smaller, more affordable EVs. This shift in consumer preference highlights a critical challenge for luxury automakers: the need to balance innovation and affordability.

Changing Consumer Preferences and Market Dynamics

In the broader context, the global EV market is experiencing remarkable growth. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), electric car sales worldwide continue to set new records, with projections indicating that more than 20 million EVs will be sold by 2025. This surge is largely driven by the increasing affordability of smaller EVs, particularly in emerging markets across Asia and Latin America. In stark contrast, luxury EVs face a declining interest, as consumers prioritize value and practicality over prestige.

The success of smaller EVs is exemplified by China’s dominance in the market, where nearly half of all car sales last year were electric. Chinese automakers have effectively captured market share by offering EVs priced under $25,000, making them accessible to a broader audience. This approach contrasts with the traditional flagship-first strategy of Western automakers, who often prioritize high-end models at the expense of entry-level options. As a result, legacy brands from Europe and the US find themselves at a disadvantage, struggling to compete with the accessible offerings of Chinese manufacturers.

The Impact of Global Economic and Policy Factors

Global economic and policy factors further complicate the landscape for luxury electric vehicles. The discontinuation of Audi’s Q8 E-tron, following the closure of its Belgian factory, highlights the impact of a “global decline in customer orders” in the electric luxury segment. Additionally, geopolitical elements, such as potential tariffs on imported cars from Europe, pose challenges for brands like Mercedes, which rely on the US market to offset poor European sales.

The removal of EV subsidies in the European Union has also dampened luxury EV sales. The European market share for EVs has decreased, despite the overall growth of the global EV market. These economic and policy shifts underscore the importance of adaptability for luxury automakers. To remain competitive, they must navigate a complex web of market dynamics, regulatory changes, and consumer expectations. This requires innovative strategies that balance luxury with affordability, ensuring that premium EVs can thrive in a rapidly changing environment.

The Future of Electric Luxury: Adapting to a New Era

As the luxury electric vehicle sector grapples with these challenges, the path forward requires a reevaluation of traditional strategies. Automakers must embrace a more inclusive approach, focusing on producing EVs that cater to a wider audience. This includes leveraging the advancements in EV technology to create models that offer both luxury and practicality. By doing so, brands can tap into the growing demand for affordable, high-quality electric vehicles.

In this evolving landscape, the legacy automakers must learn from the success of their Chinese counterparts. By prioritizing affordability, simplicity, and mass production, they can foster greater adoption of EVs and expand their market reach. This shift not only benefits consumers but also accelerates the development of vital charging infrastructure, much like the proliferation of gas stations during the rise of the Model T. As the auto industry continues to transform, how will these luxury brands redefine their roles in the electric age to meet the demands of a new generation of consumers?

And if the EPA wanted to take the money back, there's a different process the agency would need to follow.

Climate United Fund and other nonprofits in March sued the Environmental Protection Agency, its administrator Lee Zeldin and Citibank, which held the program's money. The lawsuit argued the defendants had illegally denied the groups access to billions awarded last year through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, commonly referred to as a “green bank.” The program was created by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

But the bill that passed Congress on Thursday would repeal the part of the 2022 law that established the green bank and rescind money that hadn’t already been obligated to its recipients.

The EPA said the bill should hand them a victory in their court fight that is being heard by a federal appeals court in Washington. Now that Congress has rescinded funding, an earlier federal judge’s decision forcing the EPA to release money to the groups should be reversed, the agency said in its Thursday court filing.

Climate United Fund disagrees. It acknowledges that the bill in Congress is a “significant policy setback” but argues that most of the money had been disbursed and is unaffected by the bill. And if the EPA wanted to take the money back, there's a different process the agency would need to follow.

“Our funds have already been obligated and disbursed. Any effort to claim otherwise is simply a lie to justify illegal attempts to claw back funds intended to benefit communities across the country,” CEO Beth Bafford said in a statement.

The Congressional Budget Office estimated repealing the program would save just $19 million, which is in line with its administrative expenses only, indicating the bill doesn't touch the multibillion-dollar grant awards, according to Lauren Tsuboyama, spokesperson for the Power Forward Communities coalition, which received a green bank award.

According to the EPA, when the agency terminated the grants the funds “became unobligated.”

“Grantees have desperately performed legal gymnastics to hold tens of billions of taxpayer dollars hostage. In the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill, Congress made their intent crystal clear in repealing the program entirely and returning those billions in unobligated funds to the U.S. Treasury,” EPA spokesperson Brigit Hirsch said in a statement.

The green bank’s goals run counter to the Trump administration’s opposition to policies that address climate change and its embrace of fossil fuels. Zeldin quickly made the bank a target, characterizing the $20 billion in grants as a scheme marred by conflicts of interest and potential fraud.

In February, Zeldin told Fox News that he suspected the green bank “was a clear cut case of waste and abuse” that “in my opinion, is criminal.” The following month, Zeldin terminated the grants.

U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan has previously said that when the federal government was asked for evidence of fraud, the agency didn’t provide it and shifted its position. Chutkan decided the government can’t terminate the contracts and that the groups should have access to some of their frozen money.

That order was put on hold during the EPA’s appeal.

The agency argues the nonprofits are making constitutional and statutory arguments that don’t apply in what it sees as a simple contract fight.

If the government successfully argues the case is a contract dispute, then the EPA says it should be heard by a different court that can only award a lump sum – not force the government to keep the grants in place. Federal officials argue there is no law or provision in the Constitution that compels the EPA to make these grants to these groups.

In its court filing, the EPA also pointed to comments by Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, chair of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, as supportive of the agency's position. Capito said previously the bill intended to rescind billions in funding that had been frozen.

“This action reflects not only Congress's deep concern with reducing the deficit, but EPA's administration of the (green bank) under the Biden administration, the agency's selection of grant recipients, and the absence of meaningful program oversight,"" the agency quotes the senator as saying.

However, cold weather remains a significant hurdle for electric vehicle (EV) performance, particularly in terms of battery charging speed. A recent breakthrough could revolutionize the way lithium-ion batteries function in frigid temperatures. This innovation promises to reduce charging times by up to five times during cold spells. By adapting both the structural design and chemical reactions within the battery, researchers have paved the way for enhanced EV performance in winter, potentially transforming the EV landscape in colder regions.

Revolutionary Advancements in Battery Technology

The cornerstone of this breakthrough lies in the innovative modifications made to lithium-ion batteries. Scientists have succeeded in significantly improving the charging speed of these batteries at temperatures as low as 14°F. The research, published in the journal Joule, highlights a dual approach: altering the battery’s structure and adjusting the chemical reactions that occur during charging. These modifications work in synergy to combat the thickening of the electrolyte liquid caused by cold weather, which typically slows down the movement of lithium ions and extends charging times.

The adverse effects of cold temperatures on battery performance are well-documented. As the electrolyte thickens, the electric current is reduced, leading to longer charging durations. Traditional solutions, such as thickening the electrodes, have often exacerbated the issue by further limiting fast charging capabilities. However, the new technique offers a promising alternative that effectively addresses these limitations.

Structural Modifications with Laser Precision

A key component of this innovation involves creating pathways in the anode of the battery. Researchers achieved this by using lasers to drill holes into the graphite layers of the anode. This technique, initially tested in 2020, facilitates faster movement of lithium ions, significantly enhancing charging speed. However, in cold conditions, this approach previously led to unwanted lithium deposition.

To counteract this issue, scientists applied a thin layer of lithium borate-carbonate to the battery. This material, renowned for its ability to improve the efficiency of solid-state batteries, has proven instrumental in increasing charging efficiency by an impressive 500% in cold weather. These structural modifications not only accelerate ion flow but also prevent detrimental side reactions, ensuring the battery performs optimally even in icy conditions.

Unprecedented Performance in Cold Climates

The modified batteries have exhibited remarkable durability, retaining 97% of their capacity after undergoing 100 cycles of rapid charging in freezing temperatures. This resilience underscores the potential of these innovations to be seamlessly integrated into existing battery manufacturing processes. As noted by Neil Dasgupta, these advancements do not necessitate major overhauls in production, making them highly feasible for widespread adoption.

This breakthrough is poised to enhance the performance of EVs during winter months, which is a significant selling point for consumers in regions with harsh winters. By mitigating the effects of cold weather on battery efficiency, these innovations could encourage more consumers to switch to electric vehicles, thereby contributing to global efforts to reduce carbon emissions.

The Broader Implications for Electric Vehicles

Cold temperatures are notorious for impacting the energy efficiency of electric vehicles. As the electrolyte liquid thickens, the movement of lithium ions between electrodes is hindered, leading to a reduction in electric current and increased charging times. This phenomenon also affects the energy efficiency of the vehicle, as chemical reactions become less effective in cold weather, resulting in reduced driving range.

Manufacturers have explored various strategies to address these challenges, such as increasing electrode thickness, but these have often led to further complications with fast charging. The recent study provides a more effective approach to overcoming these obstacles, offering a pathway to improved battery performance without compromising on charging speed or capacity.

The advent of these advanced battery technologies represents a significant leap forward for electric vehicles, particularly in winter conditions. By addressing the fundamental challenges posed by cold weather, these innovations have the potential to transform the EV market and accelerate the transition to sustainable transportation. As we look to the future, how will these advancements shape the global adoption of electric vehicles, and what further innovations might emerge to support this transition?

As motorists have turned their backs on Tesla, other automakers appear to have quietly taken advantage of remaining interest among consumers.

General Motors, for example, reported this week that it sold 78,167 EVs in 2025 so far — more than a 100% increase compared to the same period last year. More than half of those were sold in the second quarter.

The automaker claimed its Chevrolet division was the bestselling EV brand nationwide during the second quarter.

This comes one month after GM said the company as a whole was considered to be the #2 seller of EVs in the U.S.

“Customers are responding in record numbers to our world-class portfolio of electric and gas-powered vehicles,” Rory Harvey, executive VP and president of global markets, said in June.

“In the first two months of the second quarter, we more than doubled our EV sales compared to the same period last year,” Harvey added.

Analysts have said that GM’s success is in part due to declining levels of trust among consumers when it comes to Tesla, as many believed Musk soured on the brand’s name during his close engagement with President Donald Trump during the first 100 days of his administration.

Musk worked closely with the White House during the first 100 days of Trump’s administration, spearheading the Department of Government Efficiency’s efforts to slash the size of the federal government and federal spending.

Musk’s alliance with the administration sparked protests against Tesla worldwide, with some dealerships and Tesla drivers even facing vandalism and violent attacks in some cases.

In March, demonstrators held a “Tesla Takedown Global Day of Action” with more than 200 protests scheduled at Tesla-affiliated locations across the country.

More recently, Musk and Trump engaged in a public feud on social media over Republican lawmakers’ mega tax and policy spending legislation, known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

The bill, passed by Congress on Thursday afternoon, moved to cut several green initiatives and tax credits that have benefited Musk and his businesses like Tesla.

HOW TRUMP’S ‘BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL’ WOULD AFFECT MUSK AND TESLA

Some analysts have also noted that Tesla’s drop in sales is driven by the phasing out of these federal tax credits, including the Clean Vehicle Credit, now set to end in September. This credit currently offers consumers a $7,500 credit for purchasing plug-in vehicles.

As Tesla recovers from Musk’s drama with the White House, analysts have indicated that stability and a greater variety from other companies like GM has a big appeal for EV consumers.

The company’s automotive division secured 200,000 orders in just three minutes for the YU7 in late June, signaling strong demand in China, according to Yicai Global. As Tesla grapples with a 6.8% sales decline in China during Q2, Xiaomi’s rapid rise in the EV market demands attention from enthusiasts and industry watchers.

YU7’s Explosive Demand Outpaces Production

Xiaomi’s YU7, a sleek SUV competing in the executive E-Segment, has captured China’s attention, with 240,000 non-refundable orders placed within 18 hours of its debut. However, production bottlenecks are a significant hurdle. The standard YU7 faces wait times of up to 15 months, while the Max variant averages 9.5 months, as reported by Yicai Global. To address this, Xiaomi completed its Auto Phase II factory in June and is aggressively recruiting to boost output, according to Sina Technology. CEO Lei Jun reportedly acknowledged the delays, advising urgent buyers to consider alternatives like the Tesla Model Y or Xpeng G7.

The YU7’s specs highlight its appeal:

Range: Up to 497 miles (800 km) on a single charge (CLTC standard).

Power: Dual-motor Max variant delivers 664 hp.

Price: Starting at approximately $41,500 (299,900 CNY).

Quality Control and Global Hurdles

Despite its popularity, Xiaomi faces quality concerns. Its SU7 sedan ranked last in the 2025 Q1 China automobile quality survey for large battery-electric sedans, per CarNewsChina. Lei Jun emphasized a quality-first approach for the YU7, stating, “Knowing Xiaomi’s cars would be scrutinized by millions of netizens, that every flaw would be magnified 10-thousand-fold, we prioritized quality above all from day one,” as quoted by Yicai Global. Improving quality control is critical to building consumer trust before tackling global markets.

International expansion by 2027 presents steep challenges. Xiaomi must navigate diverse regulatory standards, establish robust sales and service networks, and scale production to meet global demand. While the company’s digital ecosystem—integrating EVs with smart platforms—sets it apart, success hinges on resolving domestic issues first.

Xiaomi’s Threat to Tesla’s Dominance

Tesla’s struggles in China, where BYD holds the largest EV market share, create an opening for Xiaomi. The YU7’s competitive pricing and impressive range position it as a strong rival to the Model Y, China’s best-selling EV in 2024. Xiaomi’s ability to leverage its tech expertise could redefine EVs as connected platforms, appealing to tech-savvy drivers. However, with production delays and quality concerns, Xiaomi’s global ambitions remain a high-stakes endeavor.

Looking Ahead

Xiaomi’s meteoric rise in China’s EV market underscores its potential to disrupt the global stage. The YU7’s rollout is a defining moment, testing Xiaomi’s ability to scale production and deliver consistent quality. While 2027 is an ambitious target for international sales, success could reshape the competitive landscape, challenging Tesla and other EV leaders. For now, Xiaomi must focus on satisfying its 240,000+ pre-order customers to build momentum for its global journey.

On July 1 (yes, today), the U.S. Senate passed its version of the tax bill, which terminates three cornerstone clean vehicle tax credits after September 30, 2025.

The Three Credits on the Chopping Block

The legislation targets the following three electric vehicle tax credits:

1.

Section 45W—Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicles Credit. This is the big one and the best one for businesses—up to $7,500 for light commercial electric vehicles and up to $40,000 for heavier trucks, based on the incremental cost over a comparable gas-powered vehicle.

2.

Section 30D—New Clean Vehicle Credit. Up to $7,500 for qualifying new electric vehicles. Requirements include domestic sourcing for critical minerals and battery components.

3.

Section 25E—Previously Owned Clean Vehicle Credit. Offers up to $4,000 (or 30 percent of the vehicle’s price) for eligible used electric vehicles.

Before making your move on a new electric vehicle, read Tax Credits for EVs: What’s New? Many turns and twists can impact the amount of your tax credit. That earlier article will help you navigate the road.

What the New Legislation Proposes

The Senate bill eliminates all three credits for vehicles placed in service after September 30, 2025. The U.S. House of Representatives bill had called for a December 31, 2025, demise with extra time for certain automakers.

But at the moment, the House bill is not in play. The House will vote on the Senate bill in order to get the finished bill to the president on or before July 4.

Update: The U.S. House of Representatives passed the Senate version on July 3. The president signed the new law (One Big Beautiful Bill Act) on July 4.

Take Action Now

If you’re considering an electric vehicle—whether a company car, delivery vehicle, or part of an electric vehicle fleet strategy—now is the time to act.

Although there’s a chance that neither the Senate nor the House tax reform will pass, and it’s possible that nothing will happen on or before July 4, the termination dates are included in the current legislative proposals. Those dates could easily remain in effect, even in legislation potentially enacted later in the year.",,N,,2025-07-05 19:06:22.229801

The legislation eliminates a wide array of clean energy tax credits, including those supporting commercial electric vehicles, alternative fuels, EV charging infrastructure, and energy-efficient building upgrades.

Port officials said the move undercuts the agency’s ability to meet its climate goals.

“The passage of this bill makes the local fight against climate change harder, not easier,” said Port of Seattle Commission President Toshiko Hasegawa. “These credits help us decarbonize our fleet and accelerate green infrastructure investments.

The bill also rescinds Environmental Protection Agency funding created under the Inflation Reduction Act, including grants the Port uses to support the transition of heavy-duty diesel trucks to electric or low-emission alternatives.

“By removing incentives for electrification and clean fuels for trucks, ships, and planes, the big bill is beyond bad for the Port’s and the nation’s ability to combat climate change and create jobs of the future,” said Commissioner Fred Felleman.

The recent uproar over Michigan’s high electricity rates deserves real scrutiny, but not just of DTE or Consumers Energy. What’s driving our bills through the roof isn’t executive pay or lobbying. It’s a radical, top-down energy agenda being pushed by Lansing politicians and rubber-stamped by bureaucrats.

In 2023, Governor Whitmer signed legislation forcing Michigan’s utilities to provide 100% “clean” energy by 2040. This includes a 50% mandate by 2030 and 60% by 2035. These are some of the most aggressive mandates in the country. They require utilities to abandon reliable, affordable fossil fuels, especially natural gas, and pour billions into wind, solar, batteries, and costly grid upgrades. And guess who’s footing the bill? We are.

green energy transition sounds noble until you see the price tag, and consider the fact that they are actually not cleaner than fossil fuels. DTE recently requested a $574 million rate increase. Consumers Energy followed with an even bigger one; $436 million annually, the largest in company history. Why? Because these companies are now forced to rip out dependable gas plants and replace them with expensive, intermittent and inefficient solar panels and wind turbines. The state can pretend this is about “saving the planet,” but the truth is clear: our energy bills are skyrocketing because of mandates we don’t need.

Let’s be honest, natural gas is not the problem. It’s one of the cleanest, safest, and most abundant energy sources in America. It produces a fraction of the emissions coal once did, and it’s been the main reason the U.S. has reduced carbon emissions over the last decade. Natural gas provides dependable baseload power during harsh Michigan winters and severe storms, when solar and wind can’t deliver. It’s also cheap, at least it was, before politicians started regulating it out of existence.

Instead of embracing this reliable resource, our state is doubling down on unreliable “renewables” that require government subsidies to survive. The wind doesn’t always blow, and the sun doesn’t always shine, the solar panels lose efficiency and the wind turbines burn up and pollute. But the bills? They keep coming, higher than ever. As a side note, solar panels also need to be cleaned regularly and in Michigan, snow removed.

If you’re frustrated with high rates, don’t just blame the utility companies and CEOs. Look at the politicians who passed laws forcing these changes and the regulators approving every penny of these rate hikes in the name of climate ideology. It’s not about modernizing the grid or protecting the environment. It’s about pushing a political agenda, no matter how much it costs working families.

Enough is enough. We don’t need 100% “clean energy” by 2040. What we need is affordable, reliable energy now, and that means standing up for natural gas and pushing back against extreme mandates that do nothing but raise our cost of living.

In the end, President Donald Trump’s giant tax and spending plan rocketed past both fiscal hawks and social moderates in the House with no changes on Thursday.

The $4 trillion One Big Beautiful Bill Act is now ready to reach across the U.S. economy, slicing into every aspect of the national effort to address climate change and environmental injustice.

The 887-page legislation largely erases the landmark investment in cleaner energy, jobs and communities that a Democratic-led Congress made only three years ago in the Inflation Reduction Act.

It stomps out incentives for purchasing electric vehicles and efficient appliances. It phases out tax credits for wind and solar energy. It opens up federal land and water for oil and gas drilling and increases its profitability, while creating new federal support for coal. It ends the historic investment in poor and minority communities that bear a disproportionate pollution burden—money that the Trump administration was already refusing to spend. It wipes out any spending on greening the federal government.

President Joe Biden’s team left office expressing confidence that his climate legacy was secure because most of the $132 billion in private investment in clean energy manufacturing spurred by his programs was going to Republican districts and states.

But Republican members of Congress who spoke out in favor of clean energy—enough members to make a decisive voting bloc in both House and Senate—refused to hold up Trump’s larger agenda for the cause. The strategy of insisting on “one big” bill, coupled with political threats against would-be foes (two of whom announced in the past week they would not seek re-election), turned out to be a winning one for the president.

During the hottest days of the hot spell the ISO was noticing a decline in operating reserves. On June 29, the grid operated normally but emergency operations were a possibility to maintain system reliability. The morning of June 30, the ISO noted potential afternoon strains on the grid on a cooler Wednesday. “Special Case Resources and Emergency Demand Response Program resources are needed,” the notice indicated, between 2 and 9 p.m. in zones of the state that included Western New York. When that notice was sent dual fuels, natural gas and nuclear were 83% of the energy being generated. Hydropower was at 15% while solar was around 3% and wind was at 0.29%.

We’re not sure Gov. Kathy Hochul could have timed her directive to the New York Power Authority to build a new nuclear plant somewhere in Upstate New York any better. After years of dumping dollar after dollar after dollar into wind and solar power, they produced a whopping 3.29% of the state’s electricity. It was renewable energy’s time to shine – and it fizzled.

Years of the Independent System Operator’s warnings about looming power shortages took on new urgency a couple of weeks ago. New York always knew it couldn’t pin all of its renewable energy hope on wind and solar power. Reliable sources of power that aren’t dependent on weather have been part of every zero emission power grid model since the state passed the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act in 2019. But in 2019 the reliable power source didn’t exist yet. There was hope it would be battery storage, but as the CLCPA’s deadlines loom that technology isn’t ready for prime time. Environmentalists have deemed natural gas not clean enough to continue using. So, we find ourselves going back to the future with nuclear power plants.

Hochul’s decision to pursue nuclear power to meet the state’s power needs calls into question the millions of dollars the state and federal government have thrown at solar and wind power over the past couple of decades only to find that nuclear power or keeping natural gas in use to generate electricity are the best options to make sure the lights come on when you flip a switch, that your car charges when you plug it in at night and your refrigerator continues running during a heat wave.

The state must take the best options to guarantee consistent, reliable power throughout the state.

Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms and Microsoft are just a few tech giants making use of carbon credits

Tech titans have a well-deserved reputation for moving fast and breaking things. But in the credibility-battered sustainability segment of carbon credits, Big Tech giants including Alphabet (GOOGL) (GOOG), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) are the ones doing the fixing. And they're taking time to do it right - at a high level only they can.

The market for carbon credits, the instruments that companies typically buy to support carbon-dioxide reduction, or CDR, cratered after a series of reports bashed their ineffectiveness. Even so, survey after survey reveals demand is as strong as ever - but only for verifiable, high-impact CDR initiatives like what Big Tech is spinning up.

If successful, these massive regional efforts could play a crucial role in capping rising global temperatures at around 1.5 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels, something scientists say will be necessary to sidestep the most devastating effects of climate change.

That's compelling for many enterprises - even in the U.S., in the face of hurricane-force political headwinds. Executives say the dollars-and-sense rationale of sustainability is too compelling to ignore. Investors demand it. Consumers prefer it. Some of today's brightest minds insist on it.

If there's a downside to the wave of Big Tech-supported projects, it's that while they're big enough to make a difference, their projects may be too stratospheric for down-to-earth-sized companies. But even that may be starting to change.

The CDR imperative

To keep rising temperatures in check, two broad directives came out of the 2016 Paris climate accord. One was the ""net zero"" mandate, which called for the globe to neutralize greenhouse-gas emissions from energy, transportation and industrial sectors by 2050. The other was to help the planet remove a lot more carbon than it's now capable of doing.

How much more? Depending on how the next 25 years unfold, we'll have to find ways to extract at least 100 billion metric tons more CO2 from the atmosphere - and perhaps as much as 1 trillion tons - by the end of the century.

All of which raises the question: Who is going to pay for all of this?

The voluntary carbon market, or VCM, stepped in with a mechanism to help companies fund carbon reduction. That put the market on a spectacular growth trajectory, quadrupling to about $2.1 billion in 2021.

Two years later, though, the market withered to $723 million, barely a third of its peak. The dramatic reversal was sparked by a series of critical reports that exposed a wide array of questionable accounting practices, including:

-- Double- and triple-counting documented emissions reductions.

-- Charging to preserve parcels in no danger of deforestation.

-- Claiming to halt deforestation for land-clearing projects that developers relocated.

Carbon credit 2.0

Sales may have shriveled, but demand never did. Buyers now insist on higher-quality credits with built-in evidence of impact. Oversight is improving. Next-gen accreditations are buttoning up.

Carbon-removal efforts largely fall into two broad camps: nature-based initiatives, like working to halt deforestation and reforesting already cleared lands; and innovative technology-centric projects like direct air capture, or DAC, which extracts CO2 from the atmosphere, and ocean alkalinity enhancement, or OAE, which helps salt water absorb more carbon. Credits to fund technology-based projects are just starting to ramp.

Nature-based and technology-based initiatives each have advantages and disadvantages. But due to the magnitude of the problem, Earth will need myriad ways to capture and store emissions. Which is why most Big Tech companies spread their investments across a mix of approaches.

In the nature-based arena, Big Tech is unquestionably going big. In May, Microsoft partnered with a carbon-credit management firm to buy 18 million tons of high-quality, long-term nature-based credits. Last year, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft and Salesforce (CRM) launched a coalition of big buyers to support nature-based CDR.

Amazon sets the pace

Nowhere is that more evident than with what Amazon.com is helping to craft in the Amazon - nature's grandest rainforest. There, the pioneer of online shopping and cloud computing is playing a pivotal role in regional-scale projects that extend across nearly a quarter of the Amazon rainforest, combined.

The massive project is a jurisdictional effort, an emerging class of regional initiatives that enlists governments to address the root cause of deforestation at a scale large enough to offer long-term benefits to local communities as well as the climate.

A major part of the funding is coming from the LEAF Coalition, which has raised more than $1 billion to sponsor projects like Amazon's. LEAF was co-founded by Amazon along with governments like Norway, the U.K. and large enterprises like Salesforce and Nestle (CH:NESN).

Perhaps most intriguing for smaller companies pining for difference-making credits, Amazon recently announced it will offer credits from a selection of initiatives, including jurisdictional projects in the Amazon, and technology-based efforts via a new service. The first credits from the service will be available later this year, Amazon says. To buy credits, companies must first meet eligibility criteria that demonstrates their decarbonization commitment.

Democratization coming?

It's too early to say whether Amazon's credits are a harbinger of broader availability for A-List credits. In the meantime, some companies - like Ryan Companies , a top-50 domestic general contractor - are happy to see the new service come available.

Joe Rozza, Ryan's chief sustainability officer, says that up to now, the company has been focused on decarbonizing operations. But Ryan is now ready to invest in carbon credits - and Amazon's service caught its attention.

""I'm really excited about the potential for scale and the impact that could come from this,"" Rozza said. ""It's an exciting development for a lot of us, I think. This concept of democratizing access to high-quality carbon credits that are having an impact on climate change right now, it gives us an opportunity in some small way to have a much more immediate effect.""

Flanked by Republican legislators and members of his Cabinet, Trump signed the multitrillion-dollar legislation at a desk on the White House driveway, then banged down a gavel gifted to him by House Speaker Mike Johnson that was used during the bill's final passage Thursday.

Against odds that at times seemed improbable, Trump achieved his goal of celebrating a historic – and divisive – legislative victory in time for the nation's birthday, which also was his self-imposed deadline for Congress to send the legislation to his desk. Fighter jets and stealth bombers streaked through the sky over the annual White House Fourth of July picnic.

America's winning, winning, winning like never before, Trump said, noting last month's bombing campaign against Iran's nuclear program, which he said the flyover was meant to honor. Promises made, promises kept, and we've kept them.

The White House was hung with red, white, and blue bunting for the Independence Day festivities. The US Marine Band played patriotic marches – and, in a typical Trumpian touch, tunes by 1980s pop icons Chaka Khan and Huey Lewis. There were three separate flyovers.

Trump spoke for a relatively brief 22 minutes before signing the bill, but was clearly energized as the legislation's passage topped a recent winning streak for his administration. That included the Iran campaign and a series of US Supreme Court rulings he's fought for.

After dark, chants of USA, USA rose from the picnic crowd on the South Lawn when Trump and the first lady, Melania, appeared on the Truman Balcony to watch the fireworks. They danced to Y.M.C.A. and waved goodbye to the crowd before they left for their home in New Jersey.

The budget legislation is the president's highest-profile win yet. It includes key campaign pledges like no tax on tips or Social Security income. Trump, who spent an unusual amount of time thanking individual Republican lawmakers who shepherded the measure through Congress, contended our country is going to be a rocket ship, economically, because of the legislation.

Big cuts to Medicaid and food stamps

Critics assailed the package as a giveaway to the rich that will rob millions more lower income people of their health insurance, food assistance, and financial stability.

Today, Donald Trump signed into law the worst job-killing bill in American history. It will rip health care from 17 million workers to pay for massive tax giveaways to the wealthy and big corporations, amounting to the country's largest money grab from the working class to the ultra-rich, AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler said in a statement. Every member of Congress who voted for this devastating bill picked the pockets of working people to hand billionaires a $5-trillion gift.

The legislation extends Trump's 2017 multitrillion-dollar tax cuts and cuts Medicaid and food stamps by $1.2 trillion. It provides for a massive increase in immigration enforcement. Congress' non-partisan scorekeeper projects that nearly 12 million more people will lose health insurance under the law.

The legislation passed the House on a largely party-line vote Thursday, culminating a months-long push by the GOP to cram most of its legislative priorities into a single budget bill that could be enacted without Senate Democrats being able to block it indefinitely by filibustering.

It passed by a single vote in the Senate, where North Carolina Republican Thom Tillis announced he would not run for reelection after incurring Trump's wrath in opposing it. Vance had to cast the tie-breaking vote.

In the House, where two Republicans voted against it, one, conservative maverick Tom Massie of Kentucky, has also become a target of Trump's well-funded political operation. No Democrats voted for the bill.

The legislation amounts to a repudiation of the agendas of the past two Democratic presidents, Barack Obama and Joe Biden, in rolling back Obama's Medicaid expansion under his signature health law and Biden's tax credits for renewable energy.

The Congressional Budget Office estimates the package will add $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the decade and 11.8 million more people will go without health coverage.

Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin on Friday called the bill devastating and said in a statement that Trump's signature on the legislation sealed the fate of the Republican Party, cementing them as the party for billionaires and special interests – not working families.

He predicted Republicans would lose their majority in Congress over it. This was a full betrayal of the American people, Martin said.

Trump complained Friday about Democrats opposing the bill, and we knew that because their hatred of either the country or me or both is so great they didn't vote at all and it's terrible.

He said their standard line is to say Republican legislation is dangerous or everybody's going to die and we can't let them get away with it. With his bill, Trump said, it's actually just the opposite, everybody's going to live.

And I just want you to know, if you see anything negative put out by Democrats, it's all a con job, Trump said, defending a package that now is law.

Speaking in Iowa on Thursday night, Trump said Democrats hate Trump – but I hate them, too.

The package is certain to be a flashpoint in next year's mid-term elections, and Democrats are making ambitious plans for rallies, voter registration drives, attack ads, bus tours, and even a multi-day vigil, all intended to highlight the most controversial elements.

Upon his return to Washington early Friday, Trump described the package as very popular, though polling suggests that public opinion is mixed at best.

For example, a Washington Post/Ipsos poll found that majorities of US adults support increasing the annual child tax credit and eliminating taxes on earnings from tips, and about half support work requirements for some adults who receive Medicaid.

But the poll found majorities oppose reducing federal funding for food assistance to low-income families and spending about $45 billion to build and maintain migrant detention centers. About 60 percent said it was unacceptable that the bill is expected to increase the $36 trillion US debt by more than $3 trillion over the next decade.",https://mb.com.ph/manilabulletin/uploads/images/2025/07/05/24452.webp,N,,2025-07-05 18:06:38.107845

Scientists in the United States tend to avoid activism; many fear that wading into politics will undermine their work and compromise their independence.
Others worry that engaging in protest or political statements will distort the value of their research and further erode Americans’ already diminishing trust in science.","This past April, I attended one of the nation’s 1,400 “Hands Off” protests, participating in what was, at the time, the largest demonstration against Donald Trump’s second term. (The recent “No Kings” demonstrations were even larger.) Thousands of people lined the sidewalks along 22nd Street in Tucson, most wearing white and holding handwritten signs, some of them funny and others not. One sign caught my eye for its matter-of-fact clarity: the simple statement “Science is not an alternative fact.” The young woman holding it must be a scientist, I thought, looking into her face.

I wondered if she was one of the many employees — more than 10% of the agency’s staff — who were recently fired from the National Institutes of Health. Perhaps she was among the 800 staffers cut from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or the 170 laid off by the National Science Foundation — half of whom were reinstated after a judge ruled that firing probationary workers was illegal. Or maybe she was one of the hundreds of researchers studying pollution, clean water and climate change who had just been fired by the Environmental Protection Agency. Then again, she could have worked at our local University of Arizona, one of many researchers whose grants were rescinded by a federal agency.

“Science is not an alternative fact.”

Or she could have been like me: Not directly affected by the cuts, but with plenty of collective and moral reasons to protest. There are so many of us whose mission is not just to understand but to make others understand and care about the life-and-death consequences of climate change. The science behind it all matters; the impacts affect everyone.

Scientists in the United States tend to avoid activism; many fear that wading into politics will undermine their work and compromise their independence. Others worry that engaging in protest or political statements will distort the value of their research and further erode Americans’ already diminishing trust in science.

And yet scientist-activists have long helped shape public opinion and address seemingly intractable societal problems — the fight against nuclear proliferation, for example, or the pushback against genetically modified foods. Remember the 1960s and ’70s? Books like Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring and research by U.S. scientists revealed the health impacts of air and water pollution, leading to the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency and the passage of landmark environmental legislation. Fast-forward to the recent past — the aftermath of the pandemic and the Black Lives Matter protests — and, of course, to today, with the ongoing climate crisis, when scientists are mobilizing and needed more than ever.

A recent piece in the journal Nature argued that this shift has been at least 15 years in the making: “Calls for activism through or in climate science have multiplied, urging scholars to engage in activism as an ethical and social duty beyond traditional roles of writing journal articles or managing research.” Acts of civil disobedience can help spark real action on climate change, while scientists can also help by serving as expert witnesses or producing scientific reports for national or regional governments and civil society sectors. “Scientists can be rigorous, objective, and engaged, all at the same time,” said the authors. “This does not necessarily imply neutrality.”

Back in 2016, during Trump’s first term, the Pew Research Center found that 56% of the general public supported a major role for climate scientists in policy decisions. As if on cue, scientists mobilized as they had not done since Vietnam. According to sociology professors Scott Frickel and Fernando Tormos-Aponte, this inspired the creation of more science advocacy organizations and a greater push for fossil fuel divestment at some universities, including the University of California system.

“Scientists can be rigorous, objective, and engaged, all at the same time.”

Frickel and Tormos-Aponte’s survey of scientists confirmed that the current cultural shift may have started with the first Trump presidency but was truly galvanized into action by the urgent need for climate justice. When the scientists were asked how often they thought they should be politically active, 95% answered “sometimes,” “most of the time” or even “always,” especially younger scientists and those who are active on social media.

A couple of weeks after the Hands Off protest, news of the dismissal of almost 400 contributors to the Sixth National Climate Assessment (NCA) mandated by Congress clearly showed that the second Trump administration’s policies are not just anti-science but outright vengeful and destructive. Not to mention irrational: The firings leave states across the West — from Washington to Nevada and Arizona — without the ability to prepare for climate impacts such as extreme heat, wildfires and drought.

In a social media post, Arizona State University scientist Dave White, a lead author of the 2023 Fifth National Climate Assessment, said he and his colleagues remain committed to scientific integrity. “We must continue to push forward,” White wrote. “The stakes are too high.”

Soon after White’s post, a group of activist scientists came forward and pledged to continue NCA’s work: The American Meteorological Society and the American Geophysical Union will now produce more than 29 peer-reviewed journals that cover all aspects of the climate crisis in this fast-changing political climate.",https://media.coloradotimesrecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-05-at-11.51.54-AM-1000x500.jpg,N,,2025-07-05 15:08:33.701082

In Illinois, data centers already take up more than 5% of the state’s total electricity consumption.
Chicagoland will likely be on the frontline of struggles around AI data centers in the years to come.","In Chicago, the electrical utility company ComEd announced that households would be paying more than $10 more on average for electricity per month this summer, a rise of 10%. In downstate Illinois, serviced by utility company Ameren, prices are rising even more. Households there can expect their electric bills to rise by roughly 20%, which for the average residential customer is around $40 a month.

This dramatic rise in the price of electricity is primarily caused by the rapid growth of AI data centers in the region. Chicagoland is one of the top markets for data centers in the country. Data centers consume huge amounts of electricity, and are creating unprecedented demand in electricity markets. These data centers are generating massive profits for some, but leave workers with more bills and devastate the environment.

‘Deregulated’ energy

Electricity rates in Illinois, like much of the United States, are not rationally set according to the needs of people or industry. Instead, the country is broken up into multiple electrical power markets. In some markets, prices are determined by auctions where utility companies, like ComEd and Ameren, bid to buy power from electricity generators — corporations like Constellation and Vistra. The cost set at these auctions determines what households eventually pay. This system has its origins in neoliberal reforms introduced in the 1990s, and was sold as a way to harness the free market to decrease prices. In reality, it has enabled energy companies to make massive profits.

Last year, an auction on these markets saw a massive increase in the price of electricity, with prices jumping 830%. On the day of the auction, the stock of Constellation rose 11% and the Vistra stock price jumped 14.5%.

The regional transmission organization that oversees the energy market that includes Chicago and much of the eastern United States is PJM Interconnection. The independent monitor of PJM attributed the spike in electricity prices to new data centers, stating that “data center load growth is the primary reason for recent and expected capacity market conditions, including total forecast load growth, the tight supply and demand balance, and high prices.” The report says that data center energy use by itself added $9.3 billion in costs to the record breaking energy auction of 2024. These costs are causing the increased bills for regular households.

Governor JB Pritzker, a champion of data center construction, pushed back on PJM for allowing these massive price increases to occur at auctions. Last month, the New York Times highlighted discontent with PJM from several state governors. The decentralized, profit-driven U.S. energy system never delivered on its promise of lower prices for consumers, and now it seems unable to cope with the rapid growth of AI data centers.

AI fuels more energy use

The growth in data centers is a nationwide phenomenon. Liberation News has previously reported on how the rapid development and deployment of AI, in the form of large language models, is currently a key priority of the U.S. capitalist class. For U.S. capitalists, AI is seen as a way to reassert their global power and cut back on labor costs, but for working people, it means potential job losses and environmental destruction.

The AI industry requires large amounts of physical infrastructure to run its models. While services like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini and Meta’s Llama may be accessible on an individual’s phone or computer, they are actually being run on specialized hardware in dedicated data centers. The massive rollout of AI, alongside crypto and cloud data, has fueled a doubling in the number of data centers from 2021 to 2024. In Illinois, data centers already take up more than 5% of the state’s total electricity consumption. This number will keep rising as new data centers are constructed.

The increased need for electricity is leading to the delay of closures for electrical plants which rely on fossil fuels, which will make hitting emission targets to mitigate climate change even harder. Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt has even advocated for abandoning climate emission goals in order to power more AI data centers, because he claims AI will solve the climate crisis.

Giant tech companies who run data centers seem to be cutting out the middleman of the energy markets entirely and signing deals directly with generators, with the deals often involving nuclear power plants. Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, site of an infamous nuclear disaster in 1979, is being brought back online after Constellation Energy signed a deal with Microsoft to power their data centers. In Illinois, Meta has signed a similar agreement with Constellation Energy to keep the nuclear power plant in Clinton in operation.

Chicagoland

Chicagoland is one of the biggest data center markets in the United States for multiple reasons. Lake Michigan can provide water to data centers close to Chicago, and the area is at the center of U.S. transportation and communication infrastructure. As noted above, technology firms are increasingly looking towards nuclear power to power their data centers. Illinois has the highest percentage of nuclear generated energy of any state in the United States, with more than half the state’s power coming from nuclear plants. Finally, Illinois political leaders have courted data center construction, passing tax breaks for their construction in 2019. Chicagoland will likely be on the frontline of struggles around AI data centers in the years to come.

The rising cost of electricity in Illinois and around the country is because capitalists and government officials are prioritizing the implementation of AI and the rapid building of data centers over the needs of working people. The rise in electricity prices is not the result of some natural phenomenon, but because of decades of policies meant to protect profits and reaffirm free-market beliefs.

The potential benefits of AI do not have to come at the cost of the average person’s standard of living and the environment. A socialist system could distribute electricity in a centralized and planned manner without the need for profit. Instead of a competition to quickly construct data centers, facilities could be constructed in a sustainable manner that protecte surrounding communities and the environment.",https://liberationnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Clinton-Power-Plant-700x350-cropped.jpg,N,,2025-07-05 15:08:25.947375

“The Bureau of Land Management’s decision to fast-track the Wildcat Loadout expansion — a project that would transport an additional 70,000 barrels of crude oil on train tracks along the Colorado River — using emergency procedures is profoundly flawed,” the Colorado Democrats said.
“This thinly analyzed decision threatens the lifeblood of the American Southwest by authorizing the transport of more than 1 billion gallons annually of additional oil on railcars traveling alongside the Colorado River,” he said.
“Any derailment and oil spill would have a devastating impact on the Colorado River and the communities and ecosystems that rely upon it.”","The Trump administration has quietly fast-tracked a massive oil expansion project that environmentalists and Democratic lawmakers warned could have a destructive impact on local communities and the climate.

As reported recently by the Oil and Gas Journal, the plan “involves expanding the Wildcat Loadout Facility, a key transfer point for moving Uinta basin crude oil to rail lines that transport it to refineries along the Gulf Coast.”

The goal of the plan is to transfer an additional 70,000 barrels of oil per day from the Wildcat Loadout Facility, which is located in Utah, down to the Gulf Coast refineries via a route that runs along the Colorado River. Controversially, the Trump administration is also plowing ahead with the project by invoking emergency powers to address energy shortages despite the fact that the United States for the last couple of years has been producing record levels of domestic oil.

Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) and Rep. Joe Neguse (D-Colo.) issued a joint statement condemning the Trump administration’s push to approve the project while rushing through environmental impact reviews.

“The Bureau of Land Management’s decision to fast-track the Wildcat Loadout expansion — a project that would transport an additional 70,000 barrels of crude oil on train tracks along the Colorado River — using emergency procedures is profoundly flawed,” the Colorado Democrats said. “These procedures give the agency just 14 days to complete an environmental review — with no opportunity for public input or administrative appeal — despite the project’s clear risks to Colorado. There is no credible energy emergency to justify bypassing public involvement and environmental safeguards. The United States is currently producing more oil and gas than any country in the world.”

On Thursday, the Bureau of Land Management announced the completion of its accelerated environmental review of the project, drawing condemnation from climate advocates.

Wendy Park, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, described the administration’s rush to approve the project as “pure hubris,” especially given its “refusal to hear community concerns about oil spill risks.” She added that “this fast-tracked review breezed past vital protections for clean air, public safety and endangered species.”

Landon Newell, staff attorney for the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, accused the Trump administration of manufacturing an energy emergency to justify plans that could have a dire impact on local habitats.

“This thinly analyzed decision threatens the lifeblood of the American Southwest by authorizing the transport of more than 1 billion gallons annually of additional oil on railcars traveling alongside the Colorado River,” he said. “Any derailment and oil spill would have a devastating impact on the Colorado River and the communities and ecosystems that rely upon it.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2207325344-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-07-05 18:05:47.688162

Back in 2023, CBS Colorado learned more about the 775,000-square-foot Amprius Technologies facility planned to open at 18875 E. Bromley Land in Brighton. State leaders said the facility would boost Colorado's clean energy economy, but neighbors felt differently.

Those same neighbors are rejoicing over the fact that the battery factory will not be becoming operational near their homes anytime soon.

Jessie Williams has spent years fighting against the lithium-ion battery manufacturing facility, which was planned to be located just 650 feet from her home.

""The biggest concern was the chemicals with our schools, our neighborhoods and our water being directly across the street,"" Williams said.

Williams said her concerns about Amprius were not just for the surrounding neighborhood, but about potential impacts to the entire community.

Lithium-ion batteries are classified as hazardous materials and are highly flammable under certain conditions.

In 2023, Amprius executives told CBS Colorado they would safely dispose of hazardous waste and follow EPA emissions requirements. They also said fires associated with lithium-ion batteries usually happen due to improper use.

""We went from door to door. We stood on corners. We went to parks,"" Williams explained.

Despite Williams delivering more than 500 signatures of opposition to Brighton City Council, the land was rezoned in September 2023.

But manufacturing never got underway. Since then, the community has continued to grow around the site.

""We actually have new homes that are going to go into the east of this,"" Williams said. ""We have our new water treatment facility that is getting ready to go online.""

And Williams has kept tabs on Amprius.

""I have made sure to watch all their moves, between all their mergers with their manufacturers, and also to see what movement was going to actually happen with the building,"" Williams said. ""Definitely keeping track on everything.""

Earlier in 2025, the company officially put the Colorado plant on hold.

Amprius CEO Kang Sun shared a statement with CBS Colorado that said, ""At this time, there are no immediate plans to move forward with the next phase of the Colorado facility. We have completed the design phase and continue to closely monitor market dynamics. Building a domestic supply chain for next-generation batteries is important, but also uniquely challenging. Manufacturing these cutting-edge battery technologies at scale in the U.S. requires a highly capital-intensive process. Beyond cost, it also demands deep technical expertise, capabilities that are still developing in the U.S. Meanwhile, other countries have spent years building mature, cost-efficient battery industries, giving them a significant head start. At Amprius, we are able to meet our production needs through a global contract manufacturing network that enables us to scale quickly without building new infrastructure. Our cells are commercially available, allowing us to meet customers' demand worldwide. In the first quarter of 2025 alone, we shipped batteries to more than 100 customers. Our silicon anode batteries are not prototypes, they are already powering applications across aviation, defense, and electric mobility sectors.""

""It's a relief. It really is,"" Williams said. ""We have not really had peace knowing that this could happen at any time -- just relief, actually able to sleep.""

For now, it's a win for Williams, who said the saga has inspired her to run for Brighton City Council.

""Let's put people before profit,"" Williams said. But she will keep an eye on her vacant neighbor.

""I'm going to continue to watch this property and make sure that we get somebody in here that's going to mesh well with what we got going on in this neighborhood,"" Williams said.

“Even with record levels of U.S. crude oil production, recent global events continue to demonstrate that international oil markets can still influence domestic fuel costs.
The report compares ethanol with refinery-derived components used to boost gasoline octane levels and finds ethanol to be a far more cost-effective option.
Without ethanol, replacing its octane contribution with refinery alternatives would raise costs by $54 billion per year.
While the report focuses on octane-related cost impacts, it does not factor in the broader economic benefits of ethanol—particularly its contribution to U.S. fuel supply.","A new report highlights the significant role American-made ethanol plays in keeping gasoline prices down, saving U.S. drivers more than $50 billion annually, an average of 39 cents per gallon, according to the release by Renewable Fuels Association (RFA).

“As the nation prepares to celebrate Independence Day, this report underscores the powerful impact of domestic ethanol production on our energy security,” said Geoff Cooper, President and CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association (RFA). “Even with record levels of U.S. crude oil production, recent global events continue to demonstrate that international oil markets can still influence domestic fuel costs. Ethanol, as a low-cost and reliable gasoline blendstock, provides a critical buffer against those price shocks.”

The study, authored by George Hoekstra of Hoekstra Trading LLC, a veteran in petroleum refining and technology, examines the financial and technical advantages of using ethanol in the U.S. fuel mix. The report compares ethanol with refinery-derived components used to boost gasoline octane levels and finds ethanol to be a far more cost-effective option.

According to Hoekstra’s findings, ethanol provides high-octane value at a fraction of the cost—approximately 4.5 times less than that of refinery-sourced octane. His analysis concludes that the presence of ethanol in the U.S. E10 fuel blend—10% ethanol by volume—lowers the wholesale cost of gasoline by about 39 cents per gallon. Without ethanol, replacing its octane contribution with refinery alternatives would raise costs by $54 billion per year.

The study also indicates that higher ethanol blends like E15, now increasingly available at retail stations, offer even greater savings per gallon of gasoline. E10 remains the standard fuel blend in the U.S., but the report suggests that expanding the use of higher-ethanol blends could lead to deeper cost reductions for consumers.

While the report focuses on octane-related cost impacts, it does not factor in the broader economic benefits of ethanol—particularly its contribution to U.S. fuel supply. Ethanol adds roughly 1 million barrels per day to the fuel market, which also helps stabilize prices by increasing overall supply.

The findings reaffirm ethanol’s role not only in lowering costs at the pump but also in reinforcing American energy independence and reducing vulnerability to global oil disruptions.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Ethanol.png,N,,2025-07-05 14:08:55.106264

This success comes despite national headwinds in the residential solar sector, whereby the solar energy market declined by just over 30% in 2024, in addition to the planned end to federal solar tax incentives.

House Republicans are pushing forward a bill that would terminate the Inflation Reduction Act's 30% residential solar tax credit by the end of 2025, as Solar.com explained, as well as gut federal support for clean energy industries.

CEO of OneEthos Marcio deOliveira said the growth of the program isn't ""necessarily"" due to people trying to get ahead of termination of incentives, but the uncertainty could ""accelerate the growth.""

""As we see the possibility of fewer incentives at the federal level,"" deOliveira said, per Utility Dive, ""Green banks become even more important to step up and provide incentives and support at the state and the regional level, to continue programs like this.""

Larger companies getting involved in promoting solar not only helps the environment, it also can be beneficial for the local economy with the creation of jobs. Even other countries are making the move to solar power a priority for their residents.

Kore isn’t alone in its dashed ambitions. In Massachusetts, a wind turbine cable factory set to be built on the site of a former coal power plant was scrapped. In Georgia, the construction of a facility that would have made parts for electric vehicle batteries was suspended more than halfway through. And in Colorado, a lithium-ion battery maker said it wouldn’t go forward with its factory there, at least for now.

They’re among the dozens of planned green factories that have been cancelled, with more delayed or downsized, all hit by soaring costs, high interest rates and slow-growing EV demand. About 9 per cent of the US$261 billion in green factory investment announced since 2021 has been shelved – most of it since President Donald Trump returned to office in January – according to research firm Atlas Public Policy.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright has said his agency doesn’t plan to move forward with some of the big-dollar loans that had been made to green manufacturing plants during president Joe Biden’s term.

Now there’s another, major threat to the sector: Mr Trump’s

massive tax-and-spending package

, which rolls back Mr Biden’s generous green subsidies.

Signed into law by Mr Trump on July 4, it phases out credits for producing solar and wind energy years before they were designed to expire. It also ends federal tax credits for electric vehicles this September instead of in 2032.

Under Mr Biden, a Democratic Congress passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in 2021 and the Inflation Reduction Act a year later, setting aside hundreds of billions of dollars in incentives for clean-energy projects. New factories were announced from South Carolina to Michigan to Arizona, set to churn out EVs, batteries and clean-energy parts. Biden and Democrats sought to bring manufacturing back to the US and make the country independent of, and competitive with, fast-electrifying China.

Many of the projects would be in red and purple states, shielding the policy against GOP attacks – or so the thinking went. That idea has now collapsed. (Among the members of Congress who voted for Mr Trump’s Bill was Paul Gosar, a Republican who represents Buckeye.)

Mr Trump said at the signing that the country “is going to be a rocketship economically.” But fallout is likely to include more clean energy projects and the jobs they provide, or could have. Tesla CEO Elon Musk had lambasted the package on X as “severely damaging” to “industries of the future.”

The US pulling back now means it will lag other countries that have invested in green technologies, and that will hurt economic growth and boost reliance on overseas manufacturers long term, said Ms Hannah Hess of Rhodium Group, a research firm.

“There’s also the risk of stranded investments, a sizable amount,” she said.

Lithium-ion battery manufacturers like Kore face strict rules on using foreign components, plus knock-on effects from the solar and EV credit phaseouts.

Because of the former, fewer grid batteries will be installed over the next decade, according to the research group Energy Innovation. The demise of the EV credit will likely dent consumer appetite for electric vehicles – and by extension, demand for the batteries they run on.

Buckeye – a former farming town named by settlers from Ohio – is a hotbed of building activity. Close to the Kore site is the suburban sprawl that’s come to characterise the Phoenix area’s rapid growth. Concrete is being poured in foundations and piles of rebar are stacked on construction sites, where tracts of desert are being transformed into new neighbourhoods.

Executives at Kore had scoured 300 sites across the country before settling on Buckeye. Land was cheap, it was close to major West Coast ports and Arizona’s dry climate wouldn’t impair the chemistry of lithium-ion batteries. The company announced its factory in 2021, planning to start construction that year and roll out batteries in 2023. It would be Buckeye’s biggest employer, creating 3,000 jobs.

But as executives drew up construction plans, inflation hiked costs, while rising interest rates made financing more expensive. And the project got mired in the same slow permitting that stalls projects nationwide.

Costs swelled to US$1.25 billion from US$1 billion, so the company made adjustments to control expenses – even downsizing the factory – and worked aggressively to keep the project alive, Kore’s current CEO Jay Bellows said in a telephone interview.

“We were trying to move as fast as we could,” Mr Bellows said. “But ultimately, the costs were just really high.” The battery maker later got a loan commitment from the Energy Department.

Kore ended up getting approvals to move forward with construction in 2024, almost a year after it had wanted to start producing batteries. And then uncertainty loomed over the fate of federal green incentives if Trump were to win the election.

In Buckeye’s city hall, about 10 minutes away from Kore’s site, Mayor Eric Orsborn sensed that things were amiss. The project’s timeline kept getting longer and delays dragged out. “Things slipped a little bit more, a little bit more,” he said in an interview in his office.

Kore then said it was ending its plans to build in Buckeye, 10 days after Mr Trump was sworn in. It’s one of 53 out of 715 green factories announced since 2021 that have been cancelled, according to Atlas Public Policy.

The outlook for green enterprises has darkened as policy shifts unsettle manufacturers, with EV makers feeling it the most, said Mr Matt Shanahan of Marathon Capital, an investment bank focused on the energy transition. “The rules have changed,” he said.

The pace of cancellations and delays depends on how the market reacts to the law, he added, but early-stage projects are especially at risk. “To break ground on a new facility – I think it’s very challenging right now.” Energy storage may remain more resilient thanks to surging data center demand, he said.

Kore is now on the hunt for an existing building to move into, with power and infrastructure in place so it can save money and get to market faster, Mr Bellows said.

Looking back, he said he learned the need to move more quickly and efficiently. The company tried, he said, but “it’s a long, arduous process” to go from dirt to a fully operating factory.

Even so, other green facilities in the region are forging ahead. In Queen Creek, another fast-growing community that’s about 80 miles to the west of Buckeye, construction is underway on a US$3 billion EV battery facility by LG Energy Solution.

Cranes tower over the sprawling site, while bulldozers kick up plumes of desert dust as forklifts scuttle by. The project has faced its own challenges – construction was paused for some time last year as the company scrapped plans for a bigger plant.

But now the factory is set to open next year, and LG plans to employ 1,500 workers there by 2027. The company said in an April press release that it aims to contribute to a “local battery ecosystem” and that it will hire locally.

“It’s a manufacturing powerhouse,” Queen Creek Mayor Julia Wheatley said in an interview, adding that the town is seeing strong interest from companies looking to move near the plant.

On a Monday in late June, the empty Kore plot scorched in 100F-plus heat. Nearby, desert gave way to parcels of farmland, discount stores and palm-tree-lined neighborhoods. Dairy cows took shade from the heat, while trucks stacked with hay bales hurtled by.

Across the road, Mr Joe Skoog, who runs a trucking company, said he would have liked to have pitched his business to Kore had the factory gone ahead. But he didn’t see the cancellation as much of a setback for the growing region. “Come back in five, 10 years’ time, and there will be more manufacturers and warehouses, and fewer farms,” he said.

Orsborn, Buckeye’s mayor, said he was disappointed, but not disheartened. He enthused about Buckeye’s population boom, fueled by Californian transplants, the big-box retailers and movie theaters opening up and how Kore’s shovel-ready site – with power, water and infrastructure now installed – is now even more attractive for other businesses that want to move in.

“Maybe another green energy one will,” he said. BLOOMBERG",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/020212dd7af48d4b30a1c11bc1292b0f5b4248342f38068048835129dc7ae508,N,,2025-07-05 14:09:01.827996

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies has restored a severely degraded Class 3 electric truck from a reported ~40-kilometer range to an estimated 295 kilometers range per charge under no-load conditions (a 255-kilometer increase; 637.5% improvement) based on results from controlled real-world performance trials.

Prototype 2.0, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' patent-pending battery rebalancing platform, demonstrated breakthrough results in the field by fully restoring lost capacity in a 144-cell NMC battery pack exhibiting severe natural cell imbalance-achieving 100% recovery of imbalance-related losses and delivering a 37.7% increase in Rated Capacity.

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies has been informed of a broader commercial opportunity following reports of widespread battery degradation across similar electric trucks in active service-underscoring growing demand for a scalable, cost-effective rebalancing solution to extend battery life and reduce operating costs for commercial EV stakeholders.

Battery X Metals Inc. (CSE:BATX)(OTCQB:BATXF)(FSE:5YW, WKN:A40X9W)(""Battery X Metals"" or the ""Company"") an energy transition resource exploration and technology company, announces that further to its news release dated June 6, 2025, its wholly-owned subsidiary, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies Inc. (""Battery X Rebalancing Technologies""), has successfully completed a real-world driving trial demonstrating a significant increase in estimated driving range for a fully electric, Class 3 commercial electric vehicle, or light-duty electric vehicle (the ""Electric Truck""), following a full battery rebalancing process using the Company's patent-pending second-generation lithium-ion battery rebalancing hardware and software platform (""Prototype 2.0"").

As part of its ongoing performance validation program for Prototype 2.0, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies recently conducted a series of real-world road tests on a rebalanced Electric Truck to evaluate post-rebalancing driving range and battery efficiency. The Electric Truck was supplied by an authorized Canadian distributor of the Electric Truck (the ""Electric Truck Authorized Distributor"") and, as represented by the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor, had previously demonstrated a significantly degraded driving range of approximately 40 kilometers per full charge caused by significant natural cell imbalance caused by real-world conditions.

In response to this battery capacity performance deficiency, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies performed a battery rebalancing procedure on the Electric Truck utilizing Prototype 2.0, as initially disclosed in the Company's news release dated June 6, 2025. During the associated rebalancing trial (the ""Rebalancing Trial""), Battery X Rebalancing Technologies successfully completed a full rebalancing process on a 144-cell lithium-ion battery pack composed of lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) chemistry, which had exhibited substantial imbalance attributable to real-world operating conditions. The Rebalancing Trial demonstrated complete (100%) recovery of imbalance-related capacity loss and yielded a 37.7% increase in the Rated Capacity (as defined in the June 6, 2025 news release) of the Electric Truck's battery pack.

The Results

Following completion of the rebalancing procedure, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies conducted a series of controlled real-world performance evaluations (each, a ""Trial"" and collectively, the ""Battery Range Performance Trials"") on the Electric Truck for the purpose of assessing post-rebalancing improvements in battery range and overall energy efficiency under actual operating conditions. In the first Trial, the Electric Truck traveled a total distance of 41 kilometers, utilizing approximately 14% of its available battery capacity, while operating across a combination of highway and city driving environments. In the second Trial, the vehicle completed a distance of 107.3 kilometers while consuming approximately 35% of its battery capacity, under similarly mixed driving conditions. The third Trial, conducted exclusively under city driving conditions, demonstrated that the vehicle traveled 58.2 kilometers while utilizing approximately 21% of its available battery charge (collectively, the ""Results"").

The Results demonstrate a material improvement in the estimated driving range and effective battery capacity of the Electric Truck. Specifically, post-rebalancing performance testing indicates an estimated driving range of approximately 295 kilometers per full charge under no-load conditions. These figures represent an increase of up to 255 kilometers in driving range under no-load conditions, corresponding to an approximately 637.5% improvement of battery driving range, as compared to the pre-rebalancing range of approximately 40 kilometers. The Results affirm the technical efficacy and commercial relevance of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' proprietary rebalancing process and support its broader applicability within light-duty electric vehicle fleets and other commercial electric transportation use cases.

The Electric Truck parent company has represented that the Electric Truck's expected driving range under maximum payload conditions is approximately 290 kilometers. Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' Battery Range Performance Trials yielded an estimated range of approximately 295 kilometers under no-load conditions following rebalancing. Although these figures were obtained under different load scenarios, the close alignment between the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor's reported range and the post-rebalancing estimate supports the reliability of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' testing methodology. Furthermore, the Results underscore the potential of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing process to restore battery performance to levels consistent with the high end of manufacturer-reported specifications.

The Battery Range Performance Trials were performed under no-load conditions; it is relevant to note that payload can have an effect on energy consumption and overall driving range. This consideration is consistent with widely recognized industry dynamics and is disclosed to provide a complete and transparent understanding of factors that may influence real-world vehicle performance. Range may vary based on payload, terrain, driving behavior, and other operational conditions.

These performance outcomes further validate the effectiveness and market relevance of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' proprietary rebalancing solution in restoring degraded battery capacity and materially extending the remaining useful life of commercial electric vehicle batteries. The Company believes these results provide compelling technical validation in support of Prototype 2.0's broader commercial deployment, particularly in fleet environments where range reliability, battery lifespan longevity, and total cost of ownership are mission-critical considerations.

Significance of Results & Market Opportunity for the Electric Truck

The Results of the Rebalancing Trial and the Battery Range Performance Trials collectively demonstrate that Prototype 2.0 is capable of effectively rebalancing lithium-ion battery packs exhibiting significant, naturally occurring cell imbalance. This successful outcome builds upon previously disclosed validation milestones achieved by Battery X Rebalancing Technologies, including third-party technical validation conducted by the National Research Council of Canada (as referenced below), as well as the Company's news release dated May 30, 2025, announcing the successful rebalancing of a naturally imbalanced Nissan Leaf battery pack-the second most common out-of-warranty electric vehicle platform in the United States.

Importantly, the Results not only validate the technical efficacy of Prototype 2.0 in an Electric Truck application, but also demonstrate its potential to recover substantial lost battery capacity resulting from cell imbalance. This performance reinforces the relevance of the Company's patent-pending technology in practical, real-world scenarios and highlights the broader need for scalable, cost-effective battery recovery solutions. The Battery Range Performance Trials further substantiates the commercial viability of Prototype 2.0 as a solution to extend the remaining useful life of aging battery packs in commercial electric vehicle fleets.

The Electric Truck and associated Electric Truck battery pack were supplied to Battery X Rebalancing Technologies at no cost for testing and evaluation by the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor, who advised that it owns and operates a fleet of approximately 20 Electric Trucks (the ""Electric Truck Fleet""). According to the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor, multiple vehicles within the Electric Truck Fleet have exhibited material battery degradation and capacity loss attributable to cell imbalance. The Rebalancing Trial and the Battery Range Performance Trials were undertaken in response to the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor's request for a viable alternative to full battery replacement, which it advised may be financially prohibitive on a fleet-wide basis.

The objective of the Rebalancing Trial and the Battery Range Performance Trials was to determine whether Prototype 2.0 could effectively restore functional battery performance in a degraded battery unit sourced from the Electric Truck Fleet. Upon successful rebalancing, the Battery Range Performance Trials further aimed to quantify the extent of recovered battery capacity in terms of estimated driving range. The positive Results are expected to inform and support ongoing discussions with the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor regarding the potential deployment of the rebalancing solution across its broader fleet, with the goal of extending battery life and mitigating the operational and financial impact of premature battery replacements.

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies has been informed by the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor that a substantial number of similar electric trucks are currently in operation across various markets, including those held by the Electric Truck's parent company, authorized distributors, commercial fleet operators, and private owners. Many of these vehicles are reportedly experiencing battery degradation symptoms consistent with cell imbalance. This feedback underscores a broader market opportunity for Battery X Rebalancing Technologies to provide a scalable, cost-effective rebalancing solution aimed at extending battery life and reducing total cost of ownership for commercial EV stakeholders.

In conjunction with the Rebalancing Trial and the Battery Range Performance Trials, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies is currently advancing the development of standardized operating procedures (""SOPs"") tailored to the Electric Truck Battery Pack, in addition to refining user interface and workflow enhancements within Prototype 2.0. The Company is also actively pursuing a commercial manufacturing agreement to support scalable production and deployment of its rebalancing platform. These activities are intended to further the Company's broader commercialization strategy, which is not limited to any single third-party opportunity. The Electric Truck-specific SOPs, however, are being developed in direct response to the successful Battery Range Performance Trials and the interest expressed by the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor.

There can be no assurance that Battery X Rebalancing Technologies will enter into any definitive commercial arrangement with the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor or any other third party at this time. While the Company remains encouraged by the Rebalancing Trial and the Battery Range Performance Trials, which demonstrate an apparent need in the marketplace, any future commercial arrangement will be subject to further technical validation, negotiation of mutually acceptable terms, and completion of all necessary operational readiness milestones.

The Problem: Rising EV Adoption Presents New Battery Lifecycle Challenges

In 2024, global EV sales reached approximately 17.1 million units, representing a 25% increase from 20231. With cumulative global EV sales from 2015 to 2023 totaling an estimated over 40 million units2, a significant share of the global EV fleet is expected to exit warranty coverage over the coming years.

By 2031, nearly 40 million electric, plug-in hybrid, and hybrid vehicles worldwide are anticipated to fall outside of their original warranty coverage3,4. This projection is based on current EV adoption figures and standard industry warranty terms, and underscores a growing risk for EV owners facing battery degradation, reduced capacity, and costly replacement requirements5. As the global EV fleet continues to expand, the demand for technologies that extend battery life, reduce long-term ownership costs, and support a sustainable transition to electric mobility is increasing.

The Solution: Pioneering Next-Generation Technologies to Support Lithium-Ion Battery Longevity

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' proprietary software and hardware technology aims to address this challenge by extending the lifespan of EV batteries. This innovation is being developed with the aim to enhance the sustainability of electric transportation and the goal to provide EV owners with a more cost-effective, environmentally friendly ownership experience by reducing the need for costly battery replacements.

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing technology, validated by the National Research Council of Canada (""NRC""), focuses on battery cell rebalancing. The NRC validation demonstrated the technology's ability to effectively correct cell imbalances in lithium-ion battery packs, recovering nearly all lost capacity due to cell imbalance. The validation was conducted on battery modules composed of fifteen 72Ah LiFePO₄ cells connected in series. The cells were initially balanced to a uniform state of charge (SOC), with a measured discharge capacity of 71.10Ah. In the validation test, three of the fifteen cells were then artificially imbalanced-one cell was charged to a 20% higher SOC, and two cells were discharged to a 20% lower SOC-resulting in a reduced discharge capacity of 46.24Ah, following rebalancing using Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing technology.

These advancements establish Battery X Rebalancing Technologies as a participant in lithium-ion and EV battery solutions, aiming to tackle the critical challenges of capacity degradation of battery packs and expensive replacements. By extending the lifecycle of battery materials within the supply chain, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies aims to support the energy transition and promote a more sustainable future.

Insight: Not Dead, But Wounded Rooftop solar isn’t gone—but without the federal credit, it becomes a harder sell.","The U.S. residential solar sector is bracing for turmoil after President Donald Trump’s so-called “Big Beautiful Bill” was signed into law, effectively gutting the 30% federal tax credit for homeowners who install rooftop solar systems.

Once a cornerstone of clean energy policy, the residential credit under Section 25D of the tax code will now vanish at the end of 2025—nearly a decade earlier than scheduled under the Inflation Reduction Act.

Originally set to run through 2034, the incentive has helped millions of Americans afford solar systems that reduce their utility bills and decrease their reliance on fossil fuels.

However, with the new law, homeowners now have a narrow window—until December 31, 2025—to claim the credit, which is worth roughly $9,000 for an average 11-kilowatt system.

Who This Hurts

The sudden policy shift could price out tens of thousands of middle-income families who depend on the tax credit to make solar feasible.

According to a Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory study, nearly 44% of solar adopters in 2023 had household incomes under $100,000.

“This is going to devastate working families,” said Will Etheridge, CEO of Southern Energy Management in North Carolina, who warned his 190 employees that layoffs are imminent. “It’s a bait and switch.”

His sentiment is echoed across the industry. A recent EnergySage survey of over 150 solar installers found that over 92% expect serious harm to their businesses, with nearly 6% planning to exit the market entirely.

Commercial Projects

Residential solar credits are being phased out quickly, but commercial and utility-scale solar projects governed under Section 48E will retain their credits until at least 2028.

However, new content requirements are set to increase: by 2026, 40% of system components must be made in the U.S., rising to 60% by 2030. This gives third-party-owned systems, such as leases and power purchase agreements (PPAs), a temporary advantage.

It’s important to note that the benefits of these models primarily accrue to companies rather than consumers, which means homeowners may experience reduced long-term savings.

Rising Costs Loom

The timing of the rollback is particularly troubling. U.S. electricity demand is projected to increase by 130% by 2030, driven in part by the growth of AI data centers and the trend toward electrification. Utilities are racing to expand generation and grid infrastructure—costs that ultimately fall on ratepayers.

Rooftop solar, often deployed more quickly than centralized infrastructure, could help alleviate grid pressure. Without it, analysts warn, the U.S. faces a higher risk of rolling blackouts, price spikes, and stalled efforts to reduce emissions.

Energy prices are already on the rise. Analysts project that typical households could see bills climb by over $140 annually. Solar offered a hedge. Without the federal tax credit, the barrier to entry just got steeper.

Impact on Jobs

The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) estimates the repeal will cost the residential solar sector over 60,000 jobs by the end of this year and nearly 200,000 by the end of 2026.

That’s a heavy blow for an industry that has added jobs five times faster than the overall U.S. economy in recent years.

Clean energy companies across the country have already reported bankruptcies, project cancellations, and hiring freezes. The North Carolina-based NC Solar Now, which relies on residential projects for 85% of its business, expects to lay off half its workforce.

“This bill took the savings from average Americans and handed it back to big utilities,” said Karl Stupka, the company’s president.

Insight: Not Dead, But Wounded

Rooftop solar isn’t gone—but without the federal credit, it becomes a harder sell. Payback periods will lengthen from 8–10 years to possibly 15–20, depending on local electricity rates and state-level support. Prices have dropped to $2.50 per watt, but time is running out.

For homeowners eyeing solar, the message is clear: If you want the credit, act fast.

For the industry, the law represents a retreat from two decades of bipartisan clean energy policy—and a warning shot to an economy still struggling to decarbonize at scale.",https://pvbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/donald-trump.jpg,N,,2025-07-05 16:07:04.835307

“The One Big Beautiful Bill delivers meaningful spending cuts while taking major steps to create a pro-business environment.","Thursday’s passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill generated responses from North Dakota’s representatives in Washington and from others across the state.

North Dakota Farmers Union President Mark Watne called the budget reconciliation package “a mixed bag.”

“There is a lot of good in the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill Act’ that will strengthen the farm safety net. We appreciate the improvements made to farm programs and tax provisions impacting agriculture and farmer-owned cooperatives,” Wayne said.

Farm bill provisions that NDFU supported include an increase in commodity reference prices to better reflect the cost of production, improved crop insurance support, improvements to livestock disaster programs, and a permanent pass-through tax deduction to maintain equity for farmer-owned cooperatives.

However, Watne said federal funding cuts to programs such as Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) run counterintuitive to farmers and ranchers who are in the business of feeding people.

“Big picture, the legislation and the reconciliation process sets a dangerous precedent in the way we draft future farm bills,” he said. “There was less opportunity to debate the merits and challenges of programs and draft bipartisan legislation that fits the needs of urban and rural voters as the farm bill is more than just farm policy. It is a food security act for our nation.”

Sen. John Hoeven, R-ND, responded, “The One Big Beautiful Bill will make our nation more prosperous and more secure. We worked to pass this legislation to provide permanent tax relief for American families that will enable them to keep more of their hard-earned paychecks. We invest in priorities like border security, national defense, unleashing American energy dominance and passing the heart and soul of the farm bill for our farmers and ranchers. At the same time, we find $1.6 trillion in savings to help with our debt and deficit. This bill delivers on the priorities that President Trump promised to get our nation back on track.”

“At the heart of this bill is a simple principle: Americans should be able to keep more of what they earn. It will help jumpstart our economy, encourage investment and help people who work hard get ahead again,” Congresswoman Juli Fedorchak, R-ND, said.

“I was proud to help move it forward, because North Dakotans — and Americans everywhere — are tired of waste, tired of overreach, and ready for the pro-America policies included in this bill to enact President Trump’s agenda,” she added. “The One Big Beautiful Bill delivers meaningful spending cuts while taking major steps to create a pro-business environment. It’s a pro-growth package that will stimulate investment, increase revenues and help bring down our national deficit. Addressing our nation’s out-of-control spending is a top priority and we must do more. This bill puts us on stronger financial footing by pairing significant spending reforms with policies that help the American economy thrive.”

However, Democrats took a different stance.

“This is a scheme to steal from working North Dakotans, struggling families, and even from nursing homes, to pay for a massive tax giveaway to the megawealthy like Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk,” North Dakota Democratic-NPL chair Adam Goldwyn said. He added the state’s congressional delegation “just voted to rip health care away from thousands of North Dakotans, take food from hungry children and kill jobs across the country. This bill is as cruel as it is unpopular. Even Republican voters do not like this bill. Our Republican lawmakers may have abandoned North Dakota, but we will continue to fight this and the many other cuts our state has been forced to suffer under Trump.”",http://d14e0irai0gcaa.cloudfront.net/www.minotdailynews.com/images/2016/11/03084632/fblike.jpg,N,,2025-07-05 18:05:35.133835

What’s the latest in tidal energy?

Mary W., New York, NY

Tidal energy—generated from the natural rise and fall of ocean tides—is one of the most predictable forms of renewable energy. Unlike wind or solar, which fluctuate based on weather, tides follow gravitational cycles that are easy to forecast. Despite this reliability and growing interest in clean energy, tidal power still accounts for only a small share of global electricity production.

There are three main ways to capture tidal energy: tidal barrages (low dams that trap water), tidal stream turbines (underwater turbines placed in fast-moving currents), and dynamic tidal power systems (which use coastal water pressure differences).

One of the most recent breakthroughs happened in early 2025, when Proteus Marine Renewables installed Japan’s first commercial-scale tidal turbine off the coast of Goto City. The 1.1 megawatt (MW) device, anchored to the seabed, shows how far the technology has come. “This milestone demonstrates that tidal energy is ready for prime time in Asia and beyond,” said Proteus CEO Andrew Clark.

Tidal energy offers several key advantages. It has high energy density, doesn’t depend on weather or sunlight, and has less impact on land and views than wind or solar farms. As Inc. Magazine’s Chris Stokel-Walker put it, “Tidal power is more reliable than solar. Why aren’t we using it?”

The answer largely concerns cost and location. Tidal systems are expensive to build and maintain, especially when placed offshore. They also only work well in coastal areas with strong, steady tides — limiting where projects can go. Additionally, there are environmental concerns about how turbines might affect marine life and sediment flow. In the U.S., permitting and regulatory processes can be slow and confusing, making it difficult to get new projects started. Local opposition from fishing communities and unclear jurisdiction over coastal waters have also slowed progress in key regions like the Pacific Northwest and parts of New England.

Still, momentum is building. Scotland, France and Canada have invested in pilot projects, and the U.S. Department of Energy is researching opportunities along American coastlines. New modular turbine designs are helping lower costs and speed up installation, an important factor to the continued development of tidal energy. As Professor Brian Polagye says, “The fundamental question is one of economics”—tidal power is still expensive and often built on a case-by-case basis, so growth will depend on more standardized designs, better supply chains, and steady long-term investment.

If tidal energy is to grow, it will need more research, better policies and stronger public support. Advocates can push for clean energy plans that include marine renewables and support companies working to improve the technology. Tidal power won’t replace solar and wind, but it could become an important part of a cleaner, more reliable energy mix if given the chance.

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing technology, validated by the National Research Council of Canada (""NRC""), focuses on battery cell rebalancing.","News Release Highlights:

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies has restored a severely degraded Class 3 electric truck from a reported ~40-kilometer range to an estimated 295 kilometers range per charge under no-load conditions (a 255-kilometer increase; 637.5% improvement) based on results from controlled real-world performance trials.

Prototype 2.0, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' patent-pending battery rebalancing platform, demonstrated breakthrough results in the field by fully restoring lost capacity in a 144-cell NMC battery pack exhibiting severe natural cell imbalance-achieving 100% recovery of imbalance-related losses and delivering a 37.7% increase in Rated Capacity.

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies has been informed of a broader commercial opportunity following reports of widespread battery degradation across similar electric trucks in active service-underscoring growing demand for a scalable, cost-effective rebalancing solution to extend battery life and reduce operating costs for commercial EV stakeholders.

Battery X Metals Inc. (CSE:BATX)(OTCQB:BATXF)(FSE:5YW, WKN:A40X9W)(""Battery X Metals"" or the ""Company"") an energy transition resource exploration and technology company, announces that further to its news release dated June 6, 2025, its wholly-owned subsidiary, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies Inc. (""Battery X Rebalancing Technologies""), has successfully completed a real-world driving trial demonstrating a significant increase in estimated driving range for a fully electric, Class 3 commercial electric vehicle, or light-duty electric vehicle (the ""Electric Truck""), following a full battery rebalancing process using the Company's patent-pending second-generation lithium-ion battery rebalancing hardware and software platform (""Prototype 2.0"").

As part of its ongoing performance validation program for Prototype 2.0, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies recently conducted a series of real-world road tests on a rebalanced Electric Truck to evaluate post-rebalancing driving range and battery efficiency. The Electric Truck was supplied by an authorized Canadian distributor of the Electric Truck (the ""Electric Truck Authorized Distributor"") and, as represented by the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor, had previously demonstrated a significantly degraded driving range of approximately 40 kilometers per full charge caused by significant natural cell imbalance caused by real-world conditions.

In response to this battery capacity performance deficiency, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies performed a battery rebalancing procedure on the Electric Truck utilizing Prototype 2.0, as initially disclosed in the Company's news release dated June 6, 2025. During the associated rebalancing trial (the ""Rebalancing Trial""), Battery X Rebalancing Technologies successfully completed a full rebalancing process on a 144-cell lithium-ion battery pack composed of lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) chemistry, which had exhibited substantial imbalance attributable to real-world operating conditions. The Rebalancing Trial demonstrated complete (100%) recovery of imbalance-related capacity loss and yielded a 37.7% increase in the Rated Capacity (as defined in the June 6, 2025 news release) of the Electric Truck's battery pack.

The Results

Following completion of the rebalancing procedure, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies conducted a series of controlled real-world performance evaluations (each, a ""Trial"" and collectively, the ""Battery Range Performance Trials"") on the Electric Truck for the purpose of assessing post-rebalancing improvements in battery range and overall energy efficiency under actual operating conditions. In the first Trial, the Electric Truck traveled a total distance of 41 kilometers, utilizing approximately 14% of its available battery capacity, while operating across a combination of highway and city driving environments. In the second Trial, the vehicle completed a distance of 107.3 kilometers while consuming approximately 35% of its battery capacity, under similarly mixed driving conditions. The third Trial, conducted exclusively under city driving conditions, demonstrated that the vehicle traveled 58.2 kilometers while utilizing approximately 21% of its available battery charge (collectively, the ""Results"").

The Results demonstrate a material improvement in the estimated driving range and effective battery capacity of the Electric Truck. Specifically, post-rebalancing performance testing indicates an estimated driving range of approximately 295 kilometers per full charge under no-load conditions. These figures represent an increase of up to 255 kilometers in driving range under no-load conditions, corresponding to an approximately 637.5% improvement of battery driving range, as compared to the pre-rebalancing range of approximately 40 kilometers. The Results affirm the technical efficacy and commercial relevance of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' proprietary rebalancing process and support its broader applicability within light-duty electric vehicle fleets and other commercial electric transportation use cases.

The Electric Truck parent company has represented that the Electric Truck's expected driving range under maximum payload conditions is approximately 290 kilometers. Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' Battery Range Performance Trials yielded an estimated range of approximately 295 kilometers under no-load conditions following rebalancing. Although these figures were obtained under different load scenarios, the close alignment between the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor's reported range and the post-rebalancing estimate supports the reliability of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' testing methodology. Furthermore, the Results underscore the potential of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing process to restore battery performance to levels consistent with the high end of manufacturer-reported specifications.

The Battery Range Performance Trials were performed under no-load conditions; it is relevant to note that payload can have an effect on energy consumption and overall driving range. This consideration is consistent with widely recognized industry dynamics and is disclosed to provide a complete and transparent understanding of factors that may influence real-world vehicle performance. Range may vary based on payload, terrain, driving behavior, and other operational conditions.

These performance outcomes further validate the effectiveness and market relevance of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' proprietary rebalancing solution in restoring degraded battery capacity and materially extending the remaining useful life of commercial electric vehicle batteries. The Company believes these results provide compelling technical validation in support of Prototype 2.0's broader commercial deployment, particularly in fleet environments where range reliability, battery lifespan longevity, and total cost of ownership are mission-critical considerations.

Significance of Results & Market Opportunity for the Electric Truck

The Results of the Rebalancing Trial and the Battery Range Performance Trials collectively demonstrate that Prototype 2.0 is capable of effectively rebalancing lithium-ion battery packs exhibiting significant, naturally occurring cell imbalance. This successful outcome builds upon previously disclosed validation milestones achieved by Battery X Rebalancing Technologies, including third-party technical validation conducted by the National Research Council of Canada (as referenced below), as well as the Company's news release dated May 30, 2025, announcing the successful rebalancing of a naturally imbalanced Nissan Leaf battery pack-the second most common out-of-warranty electric vehicle platform in the United States.

Importantly, the Results not only validate the technical efficacy of Prototype 2.0 in an Electric Truck application, but also demonstrate its potential to recover substantial lost battery capacity resulting from cell imbalance. This performance reinforces the relevance of the Company's patent-pending technology in practical, real-world scenarios and highlights the broader need for scalable, cost-effective battery recovery solutions. The Battery Range Performance Trials further substantiates the commercial viability of Prototype 2.0 as a solution to extend the remaining useful life of aging battery packs in commercial electric vehicle fleets.

The Electric Truck and associated Electric Truck battery pack were supplied to Battery X Rebalancing Technologies at no cost for testing and evaluation by the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor, who advised that it owns and operates a fleet of approximately 20 Electric Trucks (the ""Electric Truck Fleet""). According to the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor, multiple vehicles within the Electric Truck Fleet have exhibited material battery degradation and capacity loss attributable to cell imbalance. The Rebalancing Trial and the Battery Range Performance Trials were undertaken in response to the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor's request for a viable alternative to full battery replacement, which it advised may be financially prohibitive on a fleet-wide basis.

The objective of the Rebalancing Trial and the Battery Range Performance Trials was to determine whether Prototype 2.0 could effectively restore functional battery performance in a degraded battery unit sourced from the Electric Truck Fleet. Upon successful rebalancing, the Battery Range Performance Trials further aimed to quantify the extent of recovered battery capacity in terms of estimated driving range. The positive Results are expected to inform and support ongoing discussions with the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor regarding the potential deployment of the rebalancing solution across its broader fleet, with the goal of extending battery life and mitigating the operational and financial impact of premature battery replacements.

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies has been informed by the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor that a substantial number of similar electric trucks are currently in operation across various markets, including those held by the Electric Truck's parent company, authorized distributors, commercial fleet operators, and private owners. Many of these vehicles are reportedly experiencing battery degradation symptoms consistent with cell imbalance. This feedback underscores a broader market opportunity for Battery X Rebalancing Technologies to provide a scalable, cost-effective rebalancing solution aimed at extending battery life and reducing total cost of ownership for commercial EV stakeholders.

In conjunction with the Rebalancing Trial and the Battery Range Performance Trials, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies is currently advancing the development of standardized operating procedures (""SOPs"") tailored to the Electric Truck Battery Pack, in addition to refining user interface and workflow enhancements within Prototype 2.0. The Company is also actively pursuing a commercial manufacturing agreement to support scalable production and deployment of its rebalancing platform. These activities are intended to further the Company's broader commercialization strategy, which is not limited to any single third-party opportunity. The Electric Truck-specific SOPs, however, are being developed in direct response to the successful Battery Range Performance Trials and the interest expressed by the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor.

There can be no assurance that Battery X Rebalancing Technologies will enter into any definitive commercial arrangement with the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor or any other third party at this time. While the Company remains encouraged by the Rebalancing Trial and the Battery Range Performance Trials, which demonstrate an apparent need in the marketplace, any future commercial arrangement will be subject to further technical validation, negotiation of mutually acceptable terms, and completion of all necessary operational readiness milestones.

The Problem: Rising EV Adoption Presents New Battery Lifecycle Challenges

In 2024, global EV sales reached approximately 17.1 million units, representing a 25% increase from 20231. With cumulative global EV sales from 2015 to 2023 totaling an estimated over 40 million units2, a significant share of the global EV fleet is expected to exit warranty coverage over the coming years.

By 2031, nearly 40 million electric, plug-in hybrid, and hybrid vehicles worldwide are anticipated to fall outside of their original warranty coverage3,4. This projection is based on current EV adoption figures and standard industry warranty terms, and underscores a growing risk for EV owners facing battery degradation, reduced capacity, and costly replacement requirements5. As the global EV fleet continues to expand, the demand for technologies that extend battery life, reduce long-term ownership costs, and support a sustainable transition to electric mobility is increasing.

The Solution: Pioneering Next-Generation Technologies to Support Lithium-Ion Battery Longevity

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' proprietary software and hardware technology aims to address this challenge by extending the lifespan of EV batteries. This innovation is being developed with the aim to enhance the sustainability of electric transportation and the goal to provide EV owners with a more cost-effective, environmentally friendly ownership experience by reducing the need for costly battery replacements.

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing technology, validated by the National Research Council of Canada (""NRC""), focuses on battery cell rebalancing. The NRC validation demonstrated the technology's ability to effectively correct cell imbalances in lithium-ion battery packs, recovering nearly all lost capacity due to cell imbalance. The validation was conducted on battery modules composed of fifteen 72Ah LiFePO₄ cells connected in series. The cells were initially balanced to a uniform state of charge (SOC), with a measured discharge capacity of 71.10Ah. In the validation test, three of the fifteen cells were then artificially imbalanced-one cell was charged to a 20% higher SOC, and two cells were discharged to a 20% lower SOC-resulting in a reduced discharge capacity of 46.24Ah, following rebalancing using Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing technology.

These advancements establish Battery X Rebalancing Technologies as a participant in lithium-ion and EV battery solutions, aiming to tackle the critical challenges of capacity degradation of battery packs and expensive replacements. By extending the lifecycle of battery materials within the supply chain, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies aims to support the energy transition and promote a more sustainable future.

They grew up working on Hickory Nut Gap Farm in Fairview and spent a lot of time playing in the woods, “and learned to really love the land and wanted to do right by the planet.” Ager explained, “I see myself as a builder, and I want to build something that has a meaningful impact.”

The business started as a vertically integrated, one-stop solar shop. The cousins handled the sales, design, and installation of the solar panels.

Sugar Hollow employs 65 people and services Western North Carolina as well as Upstate South Carolina. Although the majority of their projects have been on single-family homes, an increasing portion of their work is in the commercial sector with businesses, developers, and community leaders. Some of their recent projects include Brevard Music School, Hunter Subaru, the Asheville Jewish Community Center, St. James Episcopal Church, and Evergreen Charter School.

“Solar energy is clean energy, and it’s a low-maintenance technology because there are no moving parts.” It involves no grimy oil changes, no fumes, and no wear and tear. Ager explained that Sugar Hollow has a service department because solar cells only generate voltage for electrical systems. They work with standard electrical systems that can fail. For that reason, Sugar Hollow’s panels come with a 25-year manufacturer warranty.

One challenge people face in going solar is that the world has built infrastructure around “the old way of doing things,” with large power plants generating power for many houses. Solar, on the other hand, provides homeowners with the opportunity to generate their own power and push it onto the grid. “Batteries are providing a pathway for stabilizing the future energy grid,” said Ager.

The dealbreaker for many potential customers is the upfront installation cost, especially now when interest rates are high. Tax credits have been crucial in promoting the technology. Yet, “demand from homeowners hasn’t risen to the point that entrepreneurs are scrambling into the field and innovating the economies of scale that will make solar more affordable.” However, demand from data centers and solar farms has the potential to change this.

Unfortunately, “in America, entrenched businesses are often slow to change.” Utilities, for example, have large lobbying arms to legislate against lateral entry into their space. “And so rooftop solar installers find themselves joining other industry groups to make sure their voices are heard.” Ager mentioned that he was in Washington, DC recently doing just that.

These days, businesses are all affected by uncertainties at the federal level. Ager noted that tariffs were initially a major concern, but over the last few years, the industry has onshored much manufacturing, which has helped stabilize supply chains. What remains concerning is the hesitancy created in the market by proposals to eliminate tax credits. Several bills are circulating; one would sunset incentives at the end of the year, while another would terminate them 180 days after the bill’s passage. “Activities at the state level are also underway to slow the transition to renewables.”

Ager is trying to persuade leaders that if they are intent on eliminating incentives, they should at least create a reasonable phase-down to prevent developers from abandoning projects due to uncertainty about whether incentives will be withdrawn. With a bittersweet tone, Ager remarked that this would be a good time for people considering whether and when to go solar to make the plunge while these incentives are still in place.",https://tribpapers.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Lolar_install_2-scaled-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-05 18:06:27.718379

Once enacted, the law will support a massive expansion of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, make sweeping cuts to programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, offer huge tax breaks and, many say, fundamentally change the nation while increasing the national debt.

Ahead of yesterday’s vote, the commonwealth’s highest elected official, Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro, warned, “the bill Congressional Republicans are rushing to pass would have devastating impacts on Pennsylvania.”

Lt. Gov. Austin Davis shared his sentiment, calling the bill “absurdly cruel and unconscionable.”

The governor highlighted Republican-led districts, noting how many would lose health care coverage in each. In total, over 300,000 Pennsylvanians are expected to lose Medicaid and about half as many to lose SNAP.

U.S. Rep. John Joyce wrote in a Facebook post that he was “incredibly proud to deliver on President Donald J. Trump’s America First agenda with the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill.”

He listed tax relief for Main Street businesses, increased border security funding and avoiding a major tax increase as some of the wins for the American people and his 13th District constituents.

“We promised to deliver for the American people, and today, that promise became a reality,” Joyce wrote.

In staunch Trump ally Rep. Scott Perry’s central Pennsylvania district, the number exceeds 18,700. Perry did ultimately vote for the bill, despite initial misgivings about the increased debt it presents.

Perry’s fellow Republican House member Rep. Ryan Mackenzie issued a press release detailing the gains he saw for his constituents.

“As we began this term, we understood what the people of the Greater Lehigh Valley were counting on: lower costs, a stronger economy, secure borders, and policies that put America First,” Mackenzie said. “In the face of relentless opposition from those who advocated for the largest tax increase in American history and a return to open borders, we’ve passed a budget that holds firm and keeps our promise to the American people.”

Mackenzie’s colleague across the aisle, progressive Democrat Rep. Summer Lee of Pittsburgh, voted against the bill.

“This is a deliberate choice to make life harder for working families here in Western Pennsylvania and across the country, to strip dignity from our seniors, to push children and parents deeper into poverty and hunger,” Lee wrote. “I will continue doing everything in my power to mitigate the harm and fight back against this fascist regime.”

The state’s Republican U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick posted to X, “Congratulations to @POTUS for putting his vision into action and to Leader Thune and Speaker Johnson for putting so much of that agenda in one bill.”

McCormick highlighted tax relief, border security, “energy dominance,” defense and school choice as wins in the bill, saying, “These are the policies I promised to pass and they’ll make a real difference for the people of Pennsylvania.”

In terms of energy dominance, recent claims that China has pulled away from the U.S. to become the global leader have roiled the states. Some believe the best answer is to double down on the nation’s wealth of fossil fuel resources, while others insist that Biden-era clean energy incentives were key to keeping up with competitors.

Pennsylvania state representative and Democratic National Committee Vice Chair Malcolm Kenyatta of Philadelphia posted to BlueSky, “The budget Republicans passed is a death knell to health care for 17 million Americans, will send kids to school hungry, hurt seniors, raise our energy prices and the list goes on. All to give a tax break to the ultra rich. And they are (expletive) celebrating it. VOTE THEM OUT!!!”

His account featured a screenshot of a since-deleted X post from Wisconsin Rep. Derrick Van Orden, which seemed to cheer the loss of safety nets for millions.

Pennsylvania House Speaker Joanna McClinton, D-Philadelphia, wrote, “I am disgusted that on the eve of our nation’s celebration of independence and triumph over tyranny, that Republicans in Congress have risked American freedom by thrusting us back under the control of an authoritarian leader; pledging their allegiance to Donald Trump and ignoring the people they represent.”

Senate President Pro Tempore Kim Ward, a Republican, posted a graphic on X from the White House celebrating the tax breaks, defense spending, clean energy rollbacks, and immigration enforcement afforded by the bill.

Of the Medicaid cuts, she wrote, “Don’t let the media gaslight you. PA’s Medicaid programs are spiraling out of control — and taxpayers are stuck with the bill. Enrollment has more than doubled to over 3 million residents, despite the state experiencing out-migration & population growth.”

Her Democratic colleague from Philadelphia, Sen. Nikil Saval, wrote that the bill “is a legislative abomination.”

“People who would do this to their neighbors and fellow Americans cannot meaningfully be said to be ‘public servants.’ The divorce between what the American people want, and what their representatives delivered, is total,” wrote Saval. “Americans across the country are opposed to this bill, on every count and every measure.”

(Bloomberg) — The vast tract of land off Route 85 was meant to be a symbol of Made-in-America manufacturing. A billion-dollar battery factory was going to rise, bringing thousands of new jobs. The business announced, “Get Ready Arizona,” the governor said the state was thrilled and even the US president gave the project a shoutout.

Article content

Four years after the fanfare, battery maker Kore Power Inc. abandoned its plans for a plant in Buckeye. The company’s chief executive officer stepped down and a promised $850 million federal loan was cancelled.

Article content

Kore isn’t alone in its dashed ambitions. In Massachusetts, a wind turbine cable factory set to be built on the site of a former coal power plant was scrapped. In Georgia, the construction of a facility that would have made parts for electric vehicle batteries was suspended more than halfway through. And in Colorado, a lithium-ion battery maker said it wouldn’t go forward with its factory there, at least for now.

Article content

They’re among the dozens of planned green factories that have been cancelled, with more delayed or downsized, all hit by soaring costs, high interest rates and slow-growing EV demand. About 9% of the $261 billion in green factory investment announced since 2021 has been shelved — most of it since President Donald Trump returned to office in January — according to research firm Atlas Public Policy. Energy Secretary Chris Wright has said his agency doesn’t plan to move forward with some of the big-dollar loans that had been made to green manufacturing plants during President Joe Biden’s term.

Now there’s another, major threat to the sector: Trump’s massive tax-and-spending package, which rolls back Biden’s generous green subsidies.

Article content

Signed into law by Trump on Friday, it phases out credits for producing solar and wind energy years before they were designed to expire. It also ends federal tax credits for electric vehicles this September instead of in 2032.

Article content

Under Biden, a Democratic Congress passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in 2021 and the Inflation Reduction Act a year later, setting aside hundreds of billions of dollars in incentives for clean-energy projects. New factories were announced from South Carolina to Michigan to Arizona, set to churn out EVs, batteries and clean-energy parts.

The company will also slash dividend payouts by nearly a third this year as lower oil prices hit its income.

The state, which directly owns 81.5% of Aramco, is heavily reliant on the payouts, which include royalties and taxes.

Besides the sale of the gas-fired plants, the company could divest assets such as housing compounds and pipelines, two of the sources said. Port infrastructure assets could also be up for sale, one of them and a third person said.

Aramco declined to comment on the potential asset sales and had no immediate comment on the amount of money the fundraising drive could yield.

The Saudi government communications office did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.

Reuters could not determine a timeline for the sale. The three sources spoke on condition of anonymity because the process is private.

Local businesses like Saudi utility firms could be interested buyers, one of the people said.

Aramco fully or partly owned 18 power plants and related infrastructure locally supplying energy to its gas plants and refineries, according to its 2024 financial report.

Other power plants are expected to come onstream soon. The Tanajib Gas Plant project is expected to start operations this year.

The potential asset sales by Aramco coincide with Saudi Arabia Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s planned massive domestic projects to diversify the economy from oil while facing pressure from tumbling crude prices.

Oil receipts made up 62% of state revenues last year with the Saudi budget showing a deficit of more than $30 billion in 2024 despite a $199 billion windfall from Aramco.

Aramco sold $5 billion of bonds in May and signalled more borrowing.

The country is pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into projects including showpiece events like the Expo 2030 world fair and soccer’s FIFA World Cup 2034.

Aramco is also seeking to raise funds for infrastructure by bringing in investors, Reuters reported in May.

This decline, reported by BMW of North America, highlights shifting consumer preferences and challenges in the EV market, even as the automaker’s traditional passenger cars and MINI brand show robust growth.

Electrified Lineup Faces Steep Declines

BMW’s EV portfolio struggled in Q2 2025, with sales of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) falling to 11,094 units, down from 14,081 units in Q2 2024. The flagship i5 sedan saw the sharpest drop, with sales plummeting 43.6% to 1,434 units. The i7 luxury sedan decreased by 11.7% to 820 units, while the iX SUV fell 12.1% to 3,116 units. The i4, a bright spot in prior quarters, also declined 19%. For the first half of 2025, BMW sold 24,632 BEVs, a slight 0.7% dip from 24,794 units in H1 2024.

These declines align with broader industry challenges, including tariff-related disruptions that paused EV shipments to dealerships. Additionally, none of BMW’s EVs qualify for the full $7,500 federal tax credit in 2025 due to battery sourcing restrictions, potentially impacting affordability compared to competitors like Tesla, which retains full incentives for models like the Model 3 and Model Y.

Passenger Cars and MINI Drive Growth

While EVs struggled, BMW’s passenger cars and MINI brand bolstered overall performance. In H1 2025, BMW sold 178,499 vehicles in North America, up 1.6% from 175,712 in H1 2024. Passenger car sales surged 11.2% year-over-year, with Q2 alone showing a 9.7% increase. MINI sales soared 19% in H1, reaching 14,592 units, and jumped 29.1% in Q2, adding 1,718 vehicles over Q2 2024.

“Our sales performance over the first half of the year is a clear indication that we have the right strategy, products, and dealer network to succeed,” said Sebastian Mackensen, President and CEO, BMW of North America. “We’re confident in our business and look forward to building on this progress in the second half of the year, despite some challenges in the marketplace.”

Industry Trends and Future Outlook

The EV sales drop reflects a cautious North American market, where consumers appear less enthusiastic about electrification than automakers anticipated. BMW’s “Light Truck” SUV segment, including models like the X3 and X5, fell 5.9% in H1 and 7.7% in Q2, suggesting a broader softening in demand for larger vehicles. Meanwhile, the success of passenger cars and MINI’s compact offerings indicates buyers favor efficiency and affordability amid economic uncertainty.

BMW’s EV strategy faces hurdles, but the upcoming Neue Klasse platform, debuting in 2026 with the iX3 and i3, promises improved range and performance on a dedicated EV architecture. For now, the 21.2% Q2 EV sales decline—equating to roughly 2,987 fewer vehicles—underscores the need for competitive pricing and incentives. With potential changes to the $7,500 tax credit looming, BMW must navigate regulatory and economic headwinds to regain EV momentum.

As part of its strategy, the government said it is set to unlock up to 10 GW of onshore wind by resolving issues with how onshore wind turbines and aerospace civil and defence infrastructure co-exist.
Delivering this strategy could more than double the current onshore wind workforce, supporting up to 45,000 jobs across the country by 2030, as the government pursues its clean power ambition of 27-29 GW of onshore wind by 2030.
""Together we are forging a path forward for onshore wind in Great Britain, and we are committed to ensuring a successful implementation through a new Onshore Wind Council, which will oversee the execution of the strategy.
James Robottom, head of Onshore Wind Deliveryat RenewableUK, said: ""Overturning the unpopular onshore wind ban, which deprived us of one of the quickest and cheapest technologies to build for a decade, was just the start.","The amount of clean, homegrown energy from onshore wind is set to accelerate over the second half of the decade as the government launches its first ever onshore wind strategy.

Thousands of new jobs are set to be created in the sector by 2030, including those working in engineering, construction, and operations maintenance, to build the onshore wind needed to deliver clean power for households and businesses.

As part of its strategy, the government said it is set to unlock up to 10 GW of onshore wind by resolving issues with how onshore wind turbines and aerospace civil and defence infrastructure co-exist.

It will also repower old turbines across the country to maintain current fleet and keep ""powering the country with clean, secure, homegrown power.""

The government also said it will equip planners and developers with the tools needed for the first English projects since the de facto ban was lifted, including making planning decisions based on up-to-date information and ensuring site surveying and assessments for projects are more efficient.

It will also explore plans to expand the clean industry bonus for onshore wind, encouraging developers to invest in supply chains in the UK's industrial heartlands or in cleaner supply chains.

Delivering this strategy could more than double the current onshore wind workforce, supporting up to 45,000 jobs across the country by 2030, as the government pursues its clean power ambition of 27-29 GW of onshore wind by 2030.

The government says that clean energy is the ""economic opportunity of the twenty-first century"", and investment in the sector is booming in the UK, with over £40bn of private investment in clean energy announced since July.

Onshore wind is also one of the easiest and cheapest technologies to build. It will supply British homes and businesses with clean, secure homegrown power that ends a reliance on unstable global gas markets, which the government says is, ""all part of the mission to get bills down for good.""

The measures being put in place mean that onshore wind will be put on an ""equal footing"" to offshore wind and nuclear, meaning projects can get built quicker in the years to come.

Some leaders in the sector commented on the announcement.

Energy Minister Michael Shanks said: ""Rolling out more onshore wind is a no-brainer – it’s one of our cheapest technologies, quick to build, supports thousands of skilled jobs and can provide clean energy directly to the communities hosting it.

""After years of decline, we’re giving industry the tools to get building again, backing industrial renewal and secure, clean, homegrown energy through our Plan for Change.

Matthieu Hue, co-chair of the Onshore Wind Taskforce and CEO of EDF Power Solutions UK and Ireland, said: ""This strategy is focusing on overcoming barriers and challenges we face across the industry in the deployment of onshore wind while capturing the major socio-economic benefits it can bring to the environment and to local economies.

""Together we are forging a path forward for onshore wind in Great Britain, and we are committed to ensuring a successful implementation through a new Onshore Wind Council, which will oversee the execution of the strategy. This is a critical part of making Britain a clean energy superpower and delivering energy security.

James Robottom, head of Onshore Wind Deliveryat RenewableUK, said: ""Overturning the unpopular onshore wind ban, which deprived us of one of the quickest and cheapest technologies to build for a decade, was just the start. The hard work to make the most of this great opportunity to grow our economy and strengthen the UK’s energy security is now in full swing.

""This strategy sets an ambitious target to almost double the UK’s onshore wind capacity by the end of the decade as a key part of the government’s Clean Power by 2030 mission.

""The measures outlined will increase confidence among investors and developers, so that we can attract billions in private investment and create thousands of highly-skilled jobs and new supply chains all over the country. The strategy also sets out how people living near onshore wind farms will continue to see tailor-made community benefits through an updated Community Benefit Protocol for England, deciding for themselves the form that these benefits should take, to support and improve the lives of those in areas hosting onshore wind.""",https://www.insidermedia.com/uploads/news/images/generic-windmill-pix.jpg,N,,2025-07-05 13:23:33.827716

HR1, the one big beautiful bill act, is not just aggressive in scope, it's a direct and deeply strategic attack on the democratic architecture of the United States. It masquerades as administrative efficiency and fiscal responsibility but underneath it's a comprehensive blueprint for executive consolidation, ideological control and systemic disenfranchisement.

Here's the blunt truth: it's authoritarianism wrapped in bureaucratic language.

HR1 is what happens when an entire governing philosophy is based on dismantling government unless it serves the powerful. Every single chapter of this bill either centralizes executive authority, defunds regulatory agencies, strips away civil protections or shifts the burden of governance onto the most vulnerable people in society.

Expedited deportations without judicial review, that's not about efficiency, that's about eliminating constitutional oversight to build a machine that can operate in darkness. Cutting independent agencies like MedPAC or the Social Security Advisory Board, that's not reform, it's removing the brakes from a runaway train.

Silencing classrooms and ending DEI funding, it's a cultural purge designed to codify a narrow exclusionary worldview into national education policy. This isn't conservative governance, it's counterdemocratic engineering. It systemically dismantles the safeguards of a free society.

The institutions targeted by HR1 aren't arbitrary, they're specifically the ones that ensure transparency, protect minorities and maintain balance. It neuters the ability to audit tax sheets, neuters public health investments, slashes environmental and emission standards.

This bill defunds every agency that stands between corporate interests and profit. It creates loopholes wide enough to drive oligarchy through. It paves the road for a soft coup.

What's most dangerous is how legally sophisticated this document is. It's not sloppy, it's not amateur, it's meticulous. It builds the legal scaffolding for one party control. It shifts power away from oversight bodies and into the hands of agencies under direct presidential control. It establishes surveillance and enforcement norms that can easily be turned on. It dissolves the idea of nonpartisan truth, replacing it with politically approved doctrine especially in education, health and environmental science.

This isn't policy, it's a hostile restructuring of the republic, not done through tanks or violence but through legislative subversion.

The human cost will be catastrophic. Let's be crystal clear: people will suffer if this bill passes. Children will go hungry as food assistance is gutted and work requirements are tightened. Trans youth will lose access to care and their families will be criminalized for seeking it. Immigrants, many of them legal residents, will live in fear of removal or retaliation workers will face unregulated financial scams.

Higher pollution and fewer rights. The elderly and disabled will face a future without independent scrutiny of Medicare or Social Security sustainability. This bill treats social safety nets as disposable and human rights as negotiable.

Final verdict: this is the dress rehearsal for autocracy. If this bill becomes law it will not just change what the government does, it will change what the government is. It is a declaration that only certain people deserve protection, only certain truths can be spoken and only certain lives are worth investment. This is the type of legislation autocrats dream of legal sweeping ideologically rigid and dressed in the language of reform. If you believe in democracy pluralism justice or simply the idea that the government should not be a weapon, HR1 must be buried, not amended, not negotiated, defeated fully!",,N,,2025-07-05 12:19:45.492949

But only a small fraction of that total consists of battery electric vehicles (BEVs).
Our Take The EV market is entering a period of uncertainty.","The second quarter of 2025 painted a chaotic picture of the electric vehicle market in the United States. While General Motors enjoyed a breakout quarter, most other automakers, especially Tesla and Ford, stumbled hard. EV sales are now a mix of breakthroughs and breakdowns.

And all of this is happening under a White House that has turned decisively against green subsidies.

GM Breaks Away From the Pack

Despite a political environment hostile to clean energy, GM managed to deliver a stunning 111% increase in EV sales compared to the same quarter last year, moving 46,280 electric vehicles. The Detroit automaker’s investment in new models appears to be paying off.

Chevrolet Equinox EV sales soared 1,600% to 17,420 units.

GMC Hummer EV saw a 54% jump, hitting 4,508 units sold.

Cadillac Optiq and Cadillac Lyriq also posted strong gains.

GM now commands an estimated 13% share of the U.S. EV market and is emerging as a real contender to Tesla’s long-standing dominance. Many analysts attribute this rise to both product quality and a growing consumer backlash against Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s polarizing political activities.

Tesla Loses Momentum

‘Tesla, the market leader for years, is now clearly in retreat. The company delivered 384,122 vehicles globally in Q2, a 13.5% decline year-over-year. U.S. sales fell an estimated 16.7% to 125,000 units.

Industry experts say Tesla’s troubles go beyond competition. Musk’s involvement in Donald Trump’s administration, as head of the controversial Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has alienated many liberal and progressive buyers who once made up a key slice of Tesla’s customer base.

Ford’s EV Lineup Struggles Too

Ford’s EV division didn’t fare much better. The company’s electric vehicle sales dropped 31.4% in Q2, totaling just 16,438 units. Key models like the F-150 Lightning and the E-Transit van were down 26% and 88% respectively.

Even Ford’s best-performing EV, the Mustang Mach-E, saw a 20% decline. A stop-sale order during the quarter due to a safety recall involving over 317,000 vehicles further dented Ford’s EV momentum.

Toyota, Hyundai, and Kia: Mixed Signals

Toyota continues to gain ground but largely on the back of hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles. It sold 320,817 “electrified vehicles” in Q2, up nearly 30% from a year ago. But only a small fraction of that total consists of battery electric vehicles (BEVs).

Hyundai and Kia reported steep declines

Hyundai Ioniq 5: Down 12%

Hyundai Ioniq 6: Down 8%

Kia EV6: Down 69%

Kia EV9: Down 79%

Both companies declined to share sales data for other electric models like the Kona EV and Niro EV.

A Mixed Picture Also for Disruptive EVs

The shifting landscape also extended to the newer, “disruptive” electric vehicle manufacturers. Rivian, known for its electric trucks and SUVs, delivered 10,661 units in the second quarter, marking a 22% decline from a year ago. While this drop might seem concerning, Rivian stated that its production was intentionally limited during this period to prepare for the launch of its 2026 model year vehicles later in July.

In contrast, luxury EV maker Lucid saw a notable increase in deliveries, soaring 38% to 3,309 units in Q2. This marks a new record for Lucid’s quarterly deliveries and its seventh consecutive quarter of increased handovers.

The Coming Surge: Tax Credit Cliff Approaches

The real wildcard in this turbulent market is federal policy. President Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” signed into law on July 4, will end the $7,500 federal tax credit for new EVs and the $4,000 credit for used EVs on September 30. Those subsidies were cornerstones of the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act and helped power EV adoption across the country.

The bill also slashes incentives for rooftop solar, heat pumps, and other green energy products, and removes fuel-efficiency penalties for automakers.

As the expiration date looms, many industry watchers expect a rush of purchases in Q3 as consumers scramble to lock in discounts. But after September?

That’s the real test.

Our Take

The EV market is entering a period of uncertainty. GM is rising. Tesla is falling. Ford is scrambling. And the federal government is pulling back its support. If Q2 was a mess, Q3 could be a feeding frenzy, and Q4 a reckoning.",https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2021/12/358332e424e140b1a7cba10430bdbe44.jpg,N,,2025-07-05 12:22:15.849528

Here, Nissan holds a critical advantage: its Nissan Leaf, the world's best-selling EV, saw a 103% surge in U.S. sales in Q1 2025.
Its near-term risks—recall costs, regulatory fines, and declining sales—outweigh its EV potential.
Toyota's conservative balance sheet (debt-to-equity ratio of 0.3x) and $6.8 billion U.S. EV investment make it a safer play.
Conclusion: A Sector in Transition Nissan's recall crisis is a stark reminder of the automotive industry's fragility.","The automotive sector is at a pivotal moment, balancing near-term disruptions from recalls and regulatory pressures against long-term structural shifts toward electric vehicles (EVs) and industry consolidation. Nowhere is this tension sharper than at Nissan, which faces a costly recall crisis that threatens its financial stability but also underscores why investors must look beyond the headlines to assess opportunities in automotive stocks.

The Short-Term Storm: Recalls, Costs, and Reputational Hits

Nissan's recent engine recall crisis—impacting over 480,000 vehicles in North America—has exposed vulnerabilities in its quality control and supply chain. The faulty bearings in its VC-Turbo engines, which risked engine failure and fires, prompted a recall costing up to $500 million, a significant burden for a company already grappling with a $11 billion loss from Renault's accounting scandal. Add to this declining U.S. sales (e.g., a 14% drop for the Rogue SUV) and regulatory scrutiny, including potential fines under the EU's 2026 Automotive Safety Act, and the short-term outlook is grim.

Investors have already priced in these risks. Nissan's shares have underperformed peers like Toyota and Honda by over 15% year-to-date, reflecting skepticism about its ability to manage costs and restore consumer trust. Meanwhile, competitors like Toyota (which saw a 0.1% rise in U.S. sales in June 2025) and General Motors (gaining EV market share to 14.4%) are capitalizing on Nissan's missteps.

The Long-Term Horizon: EV Adoption and Industry Consolidation

Yet beneath the chaos lies a structural story. The automotive sector is undergoing a $1.2 trillion EV revolution, with global EV sales expected to hit 17 million units in 2024, up 25% year-on-year. Here, Nissan holds a critical advantage: its Nissan Leaf, the world's best-selling EV, saw a 103% surge in U.S. sales in Q1 2025. This momentum, combined with its all-new Murano crossover and price cuts for the Rogue, signals a strategic pivot toward affordability and electrification.

The broader industry is also consolidating to meet EV challenges. The Honda-Nissan-Mitsubishi merger, set to finalize by 2026, aims to create a $180 billion entity with 8 million annual vehicle production capacity. This merger would pool R&D resources, cut costs (e.g., $3 billion in synergies by 2030), and accelerate EV innovation—a lifeline for Nissan, which has lagged in hybrid and battery technology.

Supplier Resilience: A Hidden Catalyst for Recovery

While Nissan's stock falters, suppliers with robust quality control and diversified supply chains are thriving. Companies like NSK (bearing manufacturer) and Panasonic (EV battery partner) have avoided recall fallout by adopting AI-driven defect detection and modular manufacturing. These suppliers are now critical to Nissan's recovery, as well as Toyota and Honda's dominance in hybrid and EV markets.

Investment Strategy: Navigating the Crossroads

Avoid Nissan's stock unless the merger succeeds. Its near-term risks—recall costs, regulatory fines, and declining sales—outweigh its EV potential. However, the merger's success could unlock value by 2030, making it a long-term bet for patient investors.

Opt for resilient competitors. Toyota's conservative balance sheet (debt-to-equity ratio of 0.3x) and $6.8 billion U.S. EV investment make it a safer play. Honda's undervalued P/B ratio (1.1x) and its leadership in the merger add further appeal.

Look to suppliers. Companies like LG Energy Solution (partner to Honda and GM) and BYD (dominating global EV markets) offer exposure to EV growth without the volatility of automaker stocks.

Conclusion: A Sector in Transition

Nissan's recall crisis is a stark reminder of the automotive industry's fragility. But it also highlights the sector's resilience and the transformative power of EVs and consolidation. Investors who focus on companies with strong balance sheets, EV leadership, and supplier partnerships will be best positioned to navigate this transition. For now, the road ahead is bumpy, but the destination—electric, consolidated, and profitable—is clear.",,N,,2025-07-05 13:23:14.469838

“North Dakotans are the ones who are building the energy future of the United States,” Vance said.
Vance said the bill funds job training and newborn savings accounts, reduces federal spending and reallocates existing funds toward border security.

“One of the things I know very, very personally, growing up in a part of the country that sometimes gets ignored and left behind, is that a lot of times, states like this don’t get as much attention from national leadership,” he said at the Dickinson Theodore Roosevelt Regional Airport. “So I thought, what better day than the Fourth of July to come to North Dakota and show people we care about them, we’re rooting for them.”

He used the stop to promote the Republican-backed bill passed by Congress on Thursday, July 3, and expected to be signed by President Donald Trump on Friday. The legislation extends Trump-era tax cuts, increases the standard deduction, offers new business incentives, and includes substantial spending and policy changes across health, energy and infrastructure.

“North Dakotans are the ones who are building the energy future of the United States,” Vance said. “There are so many provisions in this bill that are going to make it easier to invest in oil and gas drilling here in the United States.”

He framed the bill as a rollback of “Biden-era regulations” and said it is designed to boost traditional energy sectors. Among its energy provisions, Vance highlighted funding for next-generation data centers powered by on-site plants — a move he said would strengthen American competitiveness in artificial intelligence and the digital economy.

Vance pointed to China’s rapidly growing power generation as a warning. In recent years, China has more than doubled its electricity production, while U.S. output has remained relatively flat. That, he said, could pose a strategic disadvantage as demand for data and AI power soars.

The bill also includes a $50 billion Rural Hospital Transformation Program over five years aimed at stabilizing rural health care, as well as expanded telehealth and hospital reimbursements. Advocates say this may cushion potential coverage losses from Medicaid reforms, though critics warn that rural hospitals may still face funding gaps.

Vance said the bill funds job training and newborn savings accounts, reduces federal spending and reallocates existing funds toward border security. He framed it as a “correction” to what he called flawed policies under the previous administration.

On artificial intelligence, he acknowledged concerns about job displacement and expressed confidence that if infrastructure and innovation are managed domestically, the U.S. could see broader employment growth and less of a foreign-controlled future of the industry.

By visiting Dickinson — an energy hub in a state that produces nearly 20% of U.S. oil — on Independence Day, Vance said he wanted to emphasize the administration’s effort to connect national policy to local impact. The trip highlights the strategy of aligning federal legislation with energy-producing states like North Dakota, he said.

Democrats uniformly opposed the bill, while all but two House Republicans supported it.

This story was originally published by Grist. Sign up for Grist's weekly newsletter here.

“This bill will leave America a far crueler and weaker place,” said Robert Weissman, co-president of the nonprofit Public Citizen, in a statement. It “races the United States and the world toward climate catastrophe, ending support for renewable energy that is absolutely vital to avert worst-case climate scenarios.”

The so-called Big Beautiful Bill has now been approved by both chambers of Congress; all it needs now is Trump’s signature before it can become law. Trump is expected to sign it during an evening ceremony on July 4, Independence Day, according to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt.

One of Republicans’ biggest victories in the bill is the extension of deep tax cuts enacted during Trump’s first term, which are estimated to cost the country more than $4 trillion over 10 years. The legislation also directs roughly $325 billion to the military and to border security, while cutting nearly $1 trillion in funding for Medicaid, the joint state and federal program that covers medical costs for lower-income people.

To pay for the tax breaks, the bill sunsets clean energy tax credits that were put in place by the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, making wind and solar projects ineligible unless they start construction before July 2026 or are placed in service by 2027. It also imposes an expedited phaseout of consumer tax credits for new and used electric vehicles — by September 30 this year instead of by 2032. Green groups described the legislation as “historically ruinous” and “a self-inflicted tragedy for our country.”

The IRA’s tax credits and additional incentives for green energy from the bipartisan infrastructure act, also passed under former president Joe Biden, were projected to reduce the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions by 42 percent by 2030. Combined with additional action from states, cities, and private companies, they could have put the U.S. on track to meet the country’s emissions reduction target under the United Nations Paris Agreement.

Once Trump signs the megabill, however, the U.S. will have no federal plan to address the climate crisis.

“Every lawmaker who voted for this cynical measure chose tax cuts for the wealthiest over Americans’ health, pocketbooks, public lands, and waters — and a safe climate. They should be ashamed,” said Manish Bapna, president of the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council, in a statement.

Agriculture experts have also objected to Trump’s policy bill, which removes the requirement that unobligated climate-targeted funds from the IRA be funneled toward climate-specific projects — in part so they can be directed toward programs under the current farm bill, an omnibus bill for food and agriculture that the federal government renews every five to six years. The Trump megabill seeks to increase subsidies to commodity farms by about $50 billion.

The final version of the bill doesn’t include a proposal to sell off millions of acres of public lands; this was dropped following outcry from the public and some conservation-minded GOP lawmakers. It also lacks stringent limits on the use of Chinese components in renewable energy projects that were proposed in an earlier version of the bill. Some Republican lawmakers in both the House and Senate voted for the legislation in exchange for carveouts in their states, like reduced work requirements for food stamps and less severe health care cuts.

In the Thursday House vote, only two Republicans broke with their party to vote against Trump’s megabill: Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who opposes measures that would increase the federal deficit, and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, who had hesitated to support cuts to Medicaid.

All Democrats voted against the bill. Immediately preceding the House vote, Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York railed against the policy in a record-breaking 8-hour-and-45-minute House floor speech invoking scripture: “Our job is to stand up for the poor, the sick, and the afflicted,” he said.

Members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus have promised to hold Republicans accountable. More than three dozen of its members have said they’ll hold “Accountability Summer” events lambasting Republican lawmakers who supported the bill. “As Democrats, we must make sure they never live that down,” the group’s chair, Greg Casar, a Democrat of Texas, said in a statement.

Similarly, Senator Brian Schatz, a Democrat for Hawaiʻi, told The New York Times that his party should use the megabill’s spending cuts as a cudgel against Republicans ahead of next year’s midterm elections: “Our job is to point out, when kids get less to eat, when rural hospitals shutter, when the price of electricity goes up, that this is because of what your Republican elected official did,” he said.

Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill

The bill was signed into law on July 4, 2025 and includes several changes to the tax code including several significant changes for the automotive market.

These changes will significantly impact everything from consumer buying, automaker’s capital investments and tax savings for consumers.

These aren’t future changes either, they take effect now or in the coming months.

CAFE fines ended

The Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) program, signed into law in 1975, was in response to the Iran Oil crisis. This program was aimed at improving fuel economy, reducing dependence on foreign oil and thereby improving national security.

A key part of the program was the use of fines to make automakers comply with higher fuel economy standards.

“These proposed changes effectively gut the popular CAFE program, turning it into nothing more than an accounting requirement with no teeth,” Chris Harto, senior policy analyst at Consumer Reports, said in a statement when the Senate text was originally released. “Without an enforcement mechanism, many automakers are likely to continue to leave proven, popular, and cost effective technologies sitting and gathering dust on the shelf, rather than deploying them to save consumers money at the pump.”

The program has faced criticism in recent years with consumers questioning how far automakers have been forced to go with technology they see as increasingly unreliable. Trucks, specifically, have never been more fuel efficient.

Electric vehicle credit ending

First is the change in the EV credit ending on September 30, 2025.

This EV credit provided a credit of $7,500 when purchasing a new EV and $4,000 for used EVs. Automakers and dealers had requested a longer timeframe to end the credit.

Dealers stated they had 14,000 vehicles on lots and this credit is a primary buying reason for EV shoppers.

Plus, automakers have pledged billions, if not trillions of dollars in new plant construction and jobs for future EV vehicles.

Without this EV credit, analysts see the EV market seeing a significant downturn.

New EV startups like Scout and Amazon-backed Slate Auto could face significant issues getting their business going.

Auto loan interest deduction

The final piece impacting the U.S. truck market auto loan interest deduction. This is up to $10,000 of loan interest that can be deducted if the vehicle meets certain requirements.

It starts with the 2025 to 2028 tax year for qualified taxpayers and it is an “above-the-line” deduction meaning even those who take the standard deduction and don’t itemize will get the tax benefit.

The requirements are:

Eligible vehicles must be assembled in the U.S.

Manufactured primarily for use on public streets, roads, and highways

Car, minivan, van, sport utility vehicle, pickup truck or motorcycle

Vehicle must have a gross vehicle weight rating of under 14,000 pounds

Does not apply to a commercial vehicle

According to the New York Times, the only buyers who could receive the maximum deduction are those with new car loans of $110,000 or higher. The publication quoted Jonathan Smoke, an economist at market research firm Cox Automotive, who said that just one percent of loans in the U.S. are over that mark.

What does this mean for the truck market? Full-size trucks from mid-grade to so-called luxury truck buyers will get a tax benefit. It will be more beneficial for some buyers to buy new versus buying slightly used for the tax savings if it puts them in a lower tax brackets. This will be especially the case with the higher-dollar trucks. Those trucks are built in the U.S.

The lower-end trucks are often the ones built in Mexico and the lower price will make them not matter to this new bill.

Our take

It is likely people will read this article and think automakers will immediately end things like cylinder deactivation, kill turbocharged engines, direct injection, etc… And Dodge and Ram will Hellcat everything again. It is hard to see some of those immediate changes.

For starters, U.S. Presidential terms are short compared to automaker’s plans. And second, new truck sales are consistently doing well for automakers with the new technologies. Third, they use these technologies globally in larger markets like China that comply with Euro 6 emissions standards.

As with any legislation, the unintended consequences is always the more interesting things to watch play out. What will happen in the next year? Grab your popcorn.",https://pickuptrucktalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/f-150-lightning_tow_boat-copy.webp,N,,2025-07-05 13:24:58.081630

Homeowners who have used EnergySage's tools and solar marketplace to compare solar quotes have saved up to $10,000 on solar projects.","A new SolarReviews study using Zillow data on recently sold homes in 2025 found that homes with solar panels sell for 6.9% more than non-solar homes. This profit translates to about $25,000 more in average house sale prices.

Six years prior, Zillow conducted a similar study comparing the prices of solar homes to non-solar homes. The online marketplace found that solar homes outpriced non-solar homes at a rate of 4.1%, or about an average of $10,000 more.

Solar is a home upgrade that will generally increase your home's value, especially as property values increase over time.

It's also one of the best ways to become energy-independent and save money on home energy costs. EnergySage estimates that homeowners will save about $50,000 on energy costs over the lifespan of a solar system, which is about 25 years.

The math, maths.

The average cost of solar is between $17,900 and $23,600, with the national average at $20,948, according to a previous report by The Cool Down.

With federal solar tax incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act — which may not be available forever due to Congress' recent pushes to repeal it — homeowners can still save up to 30% off the cost of a qualified home solar system if installed before the end of the year.

Even at the higher end of the range for solar installations, homeowners will still experience an automatic profit or return on investment in the increased home value. Remember, Zillow data calculates an average higher home value price of about $25,000 for solar homes compared to non-solar homes.

Factoring in energy savings the solar system provides — which will reduce the cost of energy to as low as free — homeowners will likely net positive on owning and installing home solar, while helping to reduce household carbon output.

Now may be a prime time to install solar before the federal tax incentives disappear.

Using EnergySage's free mapping tool, homeowners can find additional relevant state and local solar incentives to save even more on solar installation. Homeowners who have used EnergySage's tools and solar marketplace to compare solar quotes have saved up to $10,000 on solar projects.

""Properties that come equipped with solar panels often catch the eye of buyers and tend to sell more quickly,"" said Brett Johnson, owner of real estate consulting company New Era Home Buyers, per SolarReviews.

To understand patterns of heavy rain at a more local level, communities and officials rely on data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
The administration has also dismissed the hundreds of experts who had been compiling the next edition of the National Climate Assessment, which was scheduled to come out in 2028.","Colossal bursts of rain like the ones that caused the deadly flooding in Texas are becoming more frequent and intense around the globe as the burning of fossil fuels heats the planet, scientists say.

Warm air holds more moisture than cool air, and as temperatures rise, storms can produce bigger downpours. When met on the ground with outdated infrastructure or inadequate warning systems, the results can be catastrophic.

These were the ingredients for tragedy in Texas, a state that is well acquainted with weather extremes of all kinds: high heat and deep cold, deluges and droughts, tornadoes hurricanes, hail and snow. Indeed, the Hill Country, the part of the state where the Guadalupe River swelled on Friday, is sometimes called “flash flood alley” for how at risk it is to seemingly out-of-nowhere surges of water.

Humid air blows into the area from two main sources, the Gulf of Mexico and the tropical Pacific Ocean. When this air collides with cool air drifting down across the Great Plains, severe storms can erupt. The hilly terrain and steep canyons quickly funnel the rain into river valleys, transforming lazy streams into roaring cascades.

In parts of Texas that were flooded on Friday, the quantities of rain that poured down in a six-hour stretch were so great that they had less than a tenth of 1 percent chance of falling there in any given year, according to data analyzed by Russ Schumacher, a professor of atmospheric science at Colorado State University.

The Guadalupe River rose from three feet to 34 feet in about 90 minutes, according to data from a river gauge near the town of Comfort, Texas. The volume of water exploded from 95 cubic feet per second to 166,000 cubic feet per second.

And the warming climate is creating the conditions in Texas for more of these sharp, deadly deluges.

In the eastern part of the state, the number of days per year with at least two inches of rain or snow has increased by 20 percent since 1900, according to the most recent National Climate Assessment, the federal government’s flagship report on how global warming is affecting the United States. Across Texas, the intensity of extreme rain could increase another 10 percent by 2036, according to a report last year by John Nielsen-Gammon, the Texas state climatologist.

To understand patterns of heavy rain at a more local level, communities and officials rely on data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The agency has for decades published nationwide estimates of the probabilities of various precipitation events — that is, a certain number of inches falling in a particular location over a given amount of time, from five minutes to 24 hours to 60 days.

Engineers use NOAA’s estimates to design storm drains and culverts. City planners use them to guide development and regulations in flood-prone areas.

NOAA’s next updates to the estimates are scheduled to be released starting next year. For the first time, they are expected to include projections of how extreme precipitation will evolve as the climate changes, in order to help officials plan further ahead.

But in recent months, the Trump administration has cut staff at the agency and at the National Weather Service, which sits within NOAA. The administration has also dismissed the hundreds of experts who had been compiling the next edition of the National Climate Assessment, which was scheduled to come out in 2028. And it is proposing deep cuts to NOAA’s 2026 budget, including eliminating the office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, which conducts and coordinates climate research.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/05/multimedia/05cli-texasflood-gmpc/05cli-texasflood-gmpc-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-07-05 11:03:44.747105

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency placed 139 employees on administrative leave Thursday, an agency spokesperson confirmed, after they signed a “Stand Up for Science” petition using their official titles and EPA positions.

The affected employees received an email, shared with Inside Climate News, informing them that they are on leave through July 17, pending an investigation into whether they used work time or resources when signing the petition.

The email emphasizes that “this is not a disciplinary action.”

One employee, who asked not to be named, said they signed the petition “on a Sunday on my own device.”

“I’d be shocked if anyone used work resources,” the employee went on. “We’ve taken ethics training and are aware of the law.”

While the employees are on leave, they are prohibited from using government equipment, including cell phones, logging into government-issued computers, contacting any EPA employees for access to information and performing any official EPA duties.

An EPA spokesperson wrote in an email that the agency “has a zero-tolerance policy for career bureaucrats unlawfully undermining, sabotaging, and undercutting the administration’s agenda as voted for by the great people of this country last November.”

The EPA also alleged that the petition contains misleading information, but did not specify what is incorrect.

The petition, addressed to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and members of Congress, is a “declaration of dissent” with the administration’s policies, “including those that undermine the EPA mission of protecting human health and the environment.”

“Since the Agency’s founding in 1970, EPA has accomplished this mission by leveraging science, funding, and expert staff in service to the American people,” the petition reads. “Today, we stand together in dissent against the current administration’s focus on harmful deregulation, mischaracterization of previous EPA actions, and disregard for scientific expertise.”

More than 200 EPA employees, including retirees, signed the petition, some of them only by initials. The document criticizes the agency for “undermining the public trust” by issuing misleading statements in press releases, such as referring to EPA grants as “green slush funds” and praising “clean coal as beautiful.”

The petition also accuses the administration of “ignoring scientific consensus to benefit polluters,” most notably regarding asbestos, mercury and greenhouse gases.

Health-based regulatory standards are being repealed or reconsidered, including drinking water limits for four PFAS “forever chemicals” that cause cancer.

“The decisions of the current administration frequently contradict the peer-reviewed research and recommendations of Agency experts. Such contradiction undermines EPA’s reputation as a trusted scientific authority. Make no mistake: your actions endanger public health and erode scientific progress—not only in America—but around the world.”

Signatories also lambasted the EPA for reversing progress on environmental justice, including the cancellation of billions of grant dollars to underserved communities and the removal of EJScreen, a mapping analysis tool that allowed the public to see pollution sources, neighborhood demographics and health data.

The petition also opposes the dismantling of the Office of Research and Development, whose work forms the scientific basis for federal rulemaking.

Nicole Cantello is president of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) Union Local 704, and leader of AFGE Council 238, a nationwide union that represents over 8,000 EPA employees.

She said the EPA’s allegations are baseless.

“These are trumped-up charges against EPA employees because they made a political statement the Trump administration did not like,” Cantello said. “Now the Trump administration is retaliating against them.”

Cantello said the union will fight for the employees on several legal grounds, including First Amendment protections and employment contractual rights. “We’ll be using all of them to defend our people,” she said.

Matthew Tejada, the former director of the EPA’s environmental justice program and currently senior vice president of environmental health at the Natural Resources Defense Council, blasted the Trump administration for going after the EPA employees who signed the letter.

These civil servants, he said, were “totally within their rights” to speak out. “This is a public declaration by those employees that they continue to fight to do their jobs to help people across this country live healthier, safer, more prosperous lives,” Tejada said.

Tejada emphasized that the individuals involved were not working in coordination with advocacy groups, but acting independently in defense of the agency’s mission and the public interest.

He called the administration’s reaction “another indication that this administration is unique in modern times for having zero regard for the Constitution, for protecting and supporting the people of the United States.”

“We are in completely unprecedented waters here,” Tejada said.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-102/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pfas_firefighting-foam-fema-photo-1024x512-11751718893.jpg?h=d28b8abe&itok=a3qiNWup,N,,2025-07-05 12:21:47.099059

Achieving dominance in rare earths came with a heavy cost for China, which largely tolerated severe environmental damage for many years.

This has given China’s government near complete control over a critical choke point in global trade.

But for decades in northern China, toxic sludge from rare earth processing has been dumped into a four-square-mile artificial lake. In south-central China, rare earth mines have poisoned dozens of once-green valleys and left hillsides stripped to barren red clay.

Achieving dominance in rare earths came with a heavy cost for China, which largely tolerated severe environmental damage for many years. The industrialized world, by contrast, had tighter regulations and stopped accepting even limited environmental harm from the industry as far back as the 1990s, when rare earth mines and processing centers closed elsewhere.

In China, the worst damage occurred in and around Baotou, a flat, industrial city of two million people in China’s Inner Mongolia, on the southern edge of the Gobi Desert. Baotou calls itself the world capital of the rare earth industry, but the city and its people bear the scars from decades of poorly regulated rare earths production.

An artificial lake of sludge known as the Weikuang Dam, four square miles in size, holds the waste left over after metals are extracted from mined ore. During the winter and spring, the sludge dries out. The dust that then blows off the lake is contaminated with lead, cadmium and other heavy metals, including traces of radioactive thorium, according to technical papers by Chinese scholars.

During the summer rainy season, the sludge becomes coated with a layer of water that mixes with poisons and thorium. This dangerous mix seeps into the groundwater underneath the lake.

Government cleanup efforts have helped mitigate some health and safety risks in the industry. But Chinese academics and other experts have warned that environmental damage remains after years of poor practices and lax oversight.

“The closer to the tailings lake, the more serious the pollution and the higher the environmental and ecological risk,” said scholars at the Inner Mongolia University of Science and Technology in a research paper in January.

Similarly, researchers at the elite Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, which is a government ministry, warned in a technical paper last year about “serious air and tailings pond pollution” in the Baotou area.

The Baotou Radiation Environment Management Office warned in 2009 that at the Bayan Obo iron ore and rare earths mine, 80 miles north of the city in the Gobi Desert, radioactive thorium was being “discharged into the environment in the form of waste slag, wastewater and dust.” In 2003, another paper found intellectual development disorders among children in Baotou affected by rare earths industry pollution, and a paper in 2017 found that children in Baotou still had potentially harmful levels of rare earths in their urine.

Until a crackdown in 2010 and 2011, many illegal mines in south-central China spilled acid and ammonia into streams, poisoning rice fields.

China’s leaders have been working for over a decade to clean up the country’s rare earth industry, at a cost running into the billions of dollars.

“Excessive rare earth mining has resulted in landslides, clogged rivers, environmental pollution emergencies and even major accidents and disasters, causing great damage to people’s safety and health and the ecological environment,” China’s cabinet wrote in 2012 in a comprehensive report on the industry’s pollution.

During a visit I made in 2010 to the Baotou tailings lake, a berm, little more than a high pile of earth, lay around its perimeter to contain the sludge. Rare earth refineries, then along the north side of the lake, were crude facilities with workers stirring big vats by hand. A nearby residential community had high rates of pollution-related health problems, according to Chinese experts at the time. Baotou itself was shrouded with smog, and the air had an acrid, faintly metallic taste.

Some progress since then is visible. During a return visit in early June, it was clear that the berm had been reinforced with stones. And outside the berm was a concrete-walled moat that could catch leaks from the berm.

The residential community had been moved to a less polluted area of the city. Replacing it were steel-walled industrial sheds. Few people were around. The smog had disappeared, and the air tasted clean.

Dust from the lake is a more difficult problem to resolve. In processing rare earths, acid is used to pry apart the chemical envelope that contains them in nature. Radioactive thorium is almost always released. In Baotou, it was simply dumped into the lake for decades instead of being stored in special repositories, as required in the West.

The Inner Mongolia government announced in 2015 that refineries had begun treating their waste before discharging it into the lake, but did not specify how the thorium was handled.

In the days of the Soviet Union, thorium dust blew across Scandinavia from a tailings pond at a rare earth processing facility in Estonia. Soon after the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991, the European Union spent close to 1 billion euros to build an adjacent pit with 10-foot-thick concrete walls, move the sludge into it and then cover it with 30 feet of dirt.

The Weikuang Dam has vastly more sludge because the effluent from rare earth processing is mixed into an enormous volume of material from iron ore processing. Any effort to move and store the sludge would be a logistical challenge, and no attempt to do so was visible when I visited in June.

But even as other cleanup measures continue, the Chinese authorities have increasingly censored discussions of rare earth industry pollution. State media reported a decade ago that thousands of acres of grasslands near Baotou had been closed to livestock grazing after sheep and goats had been fatally poisoned by dust from the rare earth industry. But practically no mention of that incident can be found online now inside China.

Oversight of the rare earth industry in Baotou is complicated. Pollution regulation in China is mainly the responsibility of provincial governments — in this case, the government of Inner Mongolia.

But the same provincial government also owns Baogang Group, a mining and chemicals giant that runs the Bayan Obo mine, the steel mills and most of the rare earth refineries in Baotou. Baogang has been a pillar of China’s military-industrial complex since Mao. The Baotou Museum celebrates that Baogang made much of the steel for China’s tanks and artillery in the 1950s.

During my trip to Baotou in early June, two colleagues and I were stopped on a public road by eight carloads of police officers and Baogang security guards and questioned. We were put in the back of a police cruiser and later taken to a guardroom at Baogang’s headquarters. With 21 carloads of police officers and local officials outside, we were held for two hours and questioned further before being released and told that the Weikuang Dam was “a business secret of the Baogang Group.”

A woman there who said she was with Baogang’s rare earth subsidiary, but did not provide her name, said that Baogang declined to comment.

There were also modest signs of environmental improvement during a visit in April to the main valley producing heavy rare earths near Longnan.

The Bottom Line: Buy the Gas, Not the Noise U.S. natural gas is a structural play with asymmetric upside.
In a world of energy uncertainty, U.S. natural gas offers a rare combination of growth, stability, and diversification—a divergence worth betting on.","The energy sector's volatility has long been dominated by crude oil's swings, but a quieter revolution is unfolding in natural gas. As global industrialization accelerates and LNG export infrastructure comes online, U.S. natural gas is emerging as a high-potential investment class, insulated from crude oil's price whiplash. Structural demand shifts, production resilience, and strategic storage dynamics are aligning to create a compelling opportunity.

Structural Demand: Fueling the Global Industrial Surge

Global industrialization is a relentless force. Asia's manufacturing boom, Europe's post-pandemic recovery, and North America's energy-intensive industries all rely on affordable, reliable energy. Natural gas, cleaner than coal and more flexible than renewables, is the linchpin. The EIA forecasts U.S. natural gas consumption to rise to 91 Bcf/d in 2025, up from 90 Bcf/d in 2024, driven by:

- Industrial growth: Steel, chemicals, and plastics production in the U.S. and abroad.

- LNG exports: Expected to hit 16 Bcf/d by 2026, up from 12.6 Bcf/d in 2024, as new projects like Venture Global's Plaquemines and Cheniere's Corpus Christi Stage 3 come online.

- Power sector shifts: While coal and renewables offset some gas demand, gas remains a critical baseload fuel, especially in regions like Texas and the Northeast.

Production Leverage: Efficiency Overhead

Despite a 34-rig drop in the Gulf of Mexico rig count since 2024, U.S. natural gas production remains robust. The EIA projects 106 Bcf/d in both 2025 and 2026, sustained by:

- Shale productivity: Permian and Haynesville basins saw 6.6%–7.0% year-over-year productivity gains in early 2025, thanks to optimized drilling and completion techniques.

- Gulf of Mexico projects: New fields like Shenandoah (120,000 b/d oil equivalent) and Whale (85,000 b/d) are offsetting declines in aging wells. Subsea tiebacks (e.g., Silvertip Phase 3) will add 308,000 Bcf/d by 2026.

- Drilled-but-uncompleted (DUC) wells: Operators are activating DUCs to balance rig cuts, ensuring steady supply without over-investment.

Storage Dynamics: The Price Catalyst

Natural gas inventories are a critical barometer. As of June 2025, working gas stocks stood at 2,898 Bcf, 7% above the five-year average but 6% below 2024 levels. The EIA warns that inventories may dip below the five-year average by October, tightening supply and pushing prices higher. Key drivers include:

- Summer demand peaks: Cooling-degree days (CDD) in June 2025 drove record power-sector gas consumption, with prices spiking to $4.30/MMBtu in Q3 2025.

- Export bottlenecks: LNG facilities like Golden Pass are nearing capacity, but delays in infrastructure upgrades could strain supply.

- Hurricane risk: A 17-storm 2025 Atlantic hurricane season threatens Gulf production, adding a premium to prices.

Investment Playbook: Where to Stake Your Claims

LNG Exporters: Companies like Cheniere Energy (LNG) and Venture Global (VGAS) benefit directly from rising export volumes. Their terminals are contracted long-term with Asian and European buyers, offering steady cash flows.

Gulf of Mexico Operators: Firms like Devon Energy (DVN) and EOG Resources (EOG) with Gulf exposure gain from high-margin offshore projects.

Storage and Infrastructure: Enterprise Products Partners (EPD) and Williams Companies (WMB) profit from storage bottlenecks and pipeline demand.

Natural Gas ETFs: United States Natural Gas Fund (UNG) tracks spot prices, while Global X Natural Gas ETF (GAS) offers diversified exposure.

The Bottom Line: Buy the Gas, Not the Noise

U.S. natural gas is a structural play with asymmetric upside. While crude oil faces macroeconomic headwinds, gas demand is underpinned by industrialization, LNG contracts, and seasonal storage dynamics. With prices projected to climb to $4.88/MMBtu by 2026, investors should consider allocations to gas-focused equities and ETFs. The volatility of oil may persist, but gas is quietly becoming the energy sector's steady hand.

India’s battery manufacturing sector is still in its nascent stage.
These partnerships can help secure lithium supply and support India’s battery manufacturing.
Addressing raw material gaps through global tie-ups, enhancing refining & processing capacities, and advanced battery recycling can cut import dependence.
Well-structured regulations, industry-government collaboration, and smooth execution, India can shift from assembly to value addition and emerge as a global leader in sustainable battery manufacturing.","In light of this, the 2025 Union Budget removed Basic Customs Duty (BCD) on 28 capital goods used in mobile battery manufacturing, encouraging local output for consumer electronics. As part of a broader strategy since the July 2024 Budget, India had already nullified BCD on 25 critical minerals. The 2025 Union Budget’s exemptions on cobalt powder, LiB scrap, lead, zinc, and 12 other critical minerals aim to strengthen sourcing of affordable critical mineral feedstock at competitive price, strengthen domestic battery production, and cut import dependence.

Removing BCD on critical minerals lowers costs, attracts investment in refining and recycling, and strengthens India’s battery supply chain for global competitiveness. However, this is a long-term journey, requiring approximately five to six years to rapidly scale up domestic production, enhance recycling capacities and strengthen R&D investments. This effort is key to cutting imports and building a resilient circular economy.

India’s battery manufacturing sector is still in its nascent stage. LiBs, essential for powering consumer electronics, have become the dominant technology due to their high energy density and longer lifespan. India’s rising LiB demand highlights its import dependence due to limited local manufacturing. Without strong policy support and industrial growth, reliance on countries like China, South Korea, and Japan may threaten long-term energy security and economic resilience.

Currently, China dominates the global LiB market manufacturing, accounting for 77% of worldwide cell capacity and 80% of raw material refining. To counter China’s dominance and boost local capacity, India has launched initiatives like Make in India for self-reliant manufacturing, the National Critical Mineral Mission (NCMM) for critical mineral supply, and a PLI Scheme for Critical Minerals to promote recycling and advanced technologies—together strengthening domestic industry and accelerating manufacturing.

Despite efforts to boost domestic manufacturing, securing raw material supply chains remains urgent. Under NCMM, India may form strategic partnerships with friendly nations like Australia and Chile having the largest lithium reserves to bridge the raw material gap.

India and Australia have already committed $43.2 million for joint initiatives between Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) and Indian partners, fostering collaboration in critical minerals research and technology development. India and Chile share a long-standing trade relationship, formalized by a 2005 Framework Agreement and a Preferential Trade Agreement to boost bilateral trade, including minerals and energy. These partnerships can help secure lithium supply and support India’s battery manufacturing. However, India must also invest in refining and processing to cut import dependence.

Another key hurdle to India’s LiB growth is low R&D investment. India’s Gross Expenditure on R&D (GERD) across sectors stands at just 0.64% of GDP, significantly lower than China (2.4%) and the US (3.4%). With low overall GERD, battery R&D investment remains limited, hindering innovation. To compete globally, India must strengthen multi-institutional R&D collaborations. The ministry of electronics and IT had taken an initiative to establish a Centre of Excellence on Rechargeable Battery Technology at Centre for Materials for Electronics Technology, Pune to support SMEs the R&D needs on material, machine and process of advanced chemistry cell including cathode and anode materials of various rechargeable batteries like Li-ion, sodium ion, solid state Li-ion and flexible batteries. Scaling more public-private partnerships can boost local IP and aid industry. India should explore alternative chemistries like sodium-ion, sodium-sulphur, metal-air, redox flow, and lithium-metal—to reduce reliance on vulnerable critical mineral supply chains.

Efforts may be focused on building a strong recycling framework and boosting R&D via support labs and start-up incubators can help lower costs and reduce import dependence. However, globally, the present recycling rate of Ni, Co and Li are merely 60%, 32%, and 0.5% respectively, which is due to challenging reverse logistics of collecting end-of-life batteries and lack of profitable recycling technologies with limited volume. Recycling and refining industries must adopt innovative technologies to make metal extraction more profitable.

At the same time, the emphasis on using domestically recycled materials under the Battery Waste Management Rules,2022(BWMR) though challenging, offers a chance to boost India’s self-sufficiency in critical materials. The regulation allows the targets to be met using any battery component, including non-critical materials like aluminum and plastics, rather than focusing on reclaiming lithium, cobalt, or nickel. Given the complexities, realistic timelines are key to avoid supply chain disruptions. While South Korea took over two decades to set recycled content guidelines after starting LiB production, India is aiming to introduce such regulations within just three years of commercial-scale manufacturing—highlighting the need for a more pragmatic timeline. India’s recycling infrastructure is underdeveloped, with most end-of-life LiBs poorly processed in the informal sector, causing major material losses. The current pace of progress is insufficient, making it imperative to accelerate domestic LiB manufacturing and recycling capacities in the next five to six years to meet BWMR guidelines and reduce dependency on external supply chains.

Battery recycling can reduce India’s reliance on raw material imports by recovering lithium, cobalt, and nickel from end-of-life LiBs for reuse in battery production. Unlike China, which is currently the only market with significant LiB recycling infrastructure, India’s ecosystem is deterred by limited investment and unorganised battery waste management.

As India moves towards becoming a global leader in consumer electronics, ensuring a stable and sustainable supply of LiBs will be critical. Creating reserves of recycled critical minerals under NCMM, can help achieve true Atmanirbharta. India is at a crucial juncture in its journey toward self-sufficiency in LiB manufacturing, a sector vital for clean energy, digital growth, and industrial expansion. While schemes like PLI, customs duty cuts, and NCMM offer policy momentum, building a resilient battery ecosystem needs scaled-up production, secure supply chains, and stronger R&D. Addressing raw material gaps through global tie-ups, enhancing refining & processing capacities, and advanced battery recycling can cut import dependence. Multi-institutional R&D, alternative chemistries, and phased recycling mandates will enable a circular economy. Well-structured regulations, industry-government collaboration, and smooth execution, India can shift from assembly to value addition and emerge as a global leader in sustainable battery manufacturing.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/07/05/1600x900/Employees-guide-finished-corrugated-steel-roofing-_1751311865792_1751713771407.jpg,N,,2025-07-05 10:03:42.034211

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency placed 139 employees on administrative leave Thursday, an agency spokesperson confirmed, after they signed a “Stand Up for Science” petition using their official titles and EPA positions.

The affected employees received an email, shared with Inside Climate News, informing them that they are on leave through July 17, pending an investigation into whether they used work time or resources when signing the petition.

The email emphasizes that “this is not a disciplinary action.”

One employee, who asked not to be named, said they signed the petition “on a Sunday on my own device.”

“I’d be shocked if anyone used work resources,” the employee went on. “We’ve taken ethics training and are aware of the law.”

While the employees are on leave, they are prohibited from using government equipment, including cell phones, logging into government-issued computers, contacting any EPA employees for access to information and performing any official EPA duties.

An EPA spokesperson wrote in an email that the agency “has a zero-tolerance policy for career bureaucrats unlawfully undermining, sabotaging, and undercutting the administration’s agenda as voted for by the great people of this country last November.”

The EPA also alleged that the petition contains misleading information, but did not specify what is incorrect.

The petition, addressed to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and members of Congress, is a “declaration of dissent” with the administration’s policies, “including those that undermine the EPA mission of protecting human health and the environment.”

“Since the Agency’s founding in 1970, EPA has accomplished this mission by leveraging science, funding, and expert staff in service to the American people,” the petition reads. “Today, we stand together in dissent against the current administration’s focus on harmful deregulation, mischaracterization of previous EPA actions, and disregard for scientific expertise.”

More than 200 EPA employees, including retirees, signed the petition, some of them only by initials. The document criticizes the agency for “undermining the public trust” by issuing misleading statements in press releases, such as referring to EPA grants as “green slush funds” and praising “clean coal as beautiful.”

The petition also accuses the administration of “ignoring scientific consensus to benefit polluters,” most notably regarding asbestos, mercury and greenhouse gases.

Health-based regulatory standards are being repealed or reconsidered, including drinking water limits for four PFAS “forever chemicals” that cause cancer.

“The decisions of the current administration frequently contradict the peer-reviewed research and recommendations of Agency experts. Such contradiction undermines EPA’s reputation as a trusted scientific authority. Make no mistake: your actions endanger public health and erode scientific progress—not only in America—but around the world.”

Signatories also lambasted the EPA for reversing progress on environmental justice, including the cancellation of billions of grant dollars to underserved communities and the removal of EJScreen, a mapping analysis tool that allowed the public to see pollution sources, neighborhood demographics and health data.

The petition also opposes the dismantling of the Office of Research and Development, whose work forms the scientific basis for federal rulemaking.

Nicole Cantello is president of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) Union Local 704, and leader of AFGE Council 238, a nationwide union that represents over 8,000 EPA employees.

She said the EPA’s allegations are baseless.

“These are trumped-up charges against EPA employees because they made a political statement the Trump administration did not like,” Cantello said. “Now the Trump administration is retaliating against them.”

Cantello said the union will fight for the employees on several legal grounds, including First Amendment protections and employment contractual rights. “We’ll be using all of them to defend our people,” she said.

Matthew Tejada, the former director of the EPA’s environmental justice program and currently senior vice president of environmental health at the Natural Resources Defense Council, blasted the Trump administration for going after the EPA employees who signed the letter.

These civil servants, he said, were “totally within their rights” to speak out. “This is a public declaration by those employees that they continue to fight to do their jobs to help people across this country live healthier, safer, more prosperous lives,” Tejada said.

Tejada emphasized that the individuals involved were not working in coordination with advocacy groups, but acting independently in defense of the agency’s mission and the public interest.

He called the administration’s reaction “another indication that this administration is unique in modern times for having zero regard for the Constitution, for protecting and supporting the people of the United States.”

“We are in completely unprecedented waters here,” Tejada said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/PFAS_firefighting-foam-FEMA-photo-1024x512-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-05 10:04:00.263838

Even some of the authors of Mr. Trump’s first-term tax cuts were critics of the budget number gimmicks that went into this new law.
Unlike the Bush and Trump I tax cuts, the major provisions here are permanent, so there is no expiration date to provide leverage for opponents.
Even worse, the few tax cuts that will expire — like no taxes on tips — seem to be just as popular with Democrats as with Republicans.","In the 30 years I have been a part of fiscal policymaking I don’t think I have ever seen a legislative push as impressive as the passage of President Trump’s big, dubious tax and policy bill.

Don’t get me wrong: The consequences for health insurance, poverty, climate change and macroeconomic stability, in roughly that order of importance, will be horrendous. The Medicaid and other health care changes would undo about three-quarters of the coverage expansion from President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act and Medicaid expansion. The law repeals much of what Joe Biden did for climate change in the Inflation Reduction Act. The tax provisions sustain most of the cuts from Mr. Trump’s first term and add in several others for good measure.

But before Democrats — and hopefully some Republicans — even try to fix the damage, they should learn the lessons of how the Republicans got all this done, working against tremendous odds on a much faster timetable than the major legislative accomplishments from Mr. Trump’s three predecessors.

The first lesson is that ideas really do matter. This legislation did not happen because the public or lobbyists were clamoring for it. Instead Donald Trump and congressional Republicans wanted it and were willing to overcome public disfavor and opposition from vested interests.

Sure, special interests were at play in ways big (preserving workarounds to limits on state and local tax deductions) and small (getting new tax breaks for Alaskan whaling captains). But no major lobbying groups were asking for the broad contours of this legislation. The health care industry, which is expected to lose about half a trillion dollars, and the energy industry, which is losing huge tax breaks and subsidies, put up a fight. Their opposition, like that of other industries, went nowhere. And neither did Elon Musk’s — further evidence that oligarchy is the wrong lens through which to view this political moment.

The second lesson is that while ideas matter, expert ideas do not necessarily matter. Past fiscal debates have divided economists and policy wonks. In President Trump’s first term, some economists would write opinion articles or go on TV news programs defending his tax cuts as adding to growth while other economists (including me) would write rebuttals.

This time around there was almost no debate: Wonks from across the political spectrum opposed the legislation. The right-leaning Tax Foundation pushed back against the administration’s claim that the legislation would not add to the deficit. The free-market American Enterprise Institute criticized key tax proposals and advanced a radically different alternative. Even some of the authors of Mr. Trump’s first-term tax cuts were critics of the budget number gimmicks that went into this new law. None of them changed the outcome.

The third lesson is that you can overcome opposition to a bill that delivers a direct loss to far more people — and a direct win for far fewer — than conventional wisdom would suggest is possible. President George W. Bush found it impossible to curtail food stamps when he was pushing a deficit reduction plan in 2006 or to cut much more than $26 billion in Medicaid funding, only about 5 percent of the total reduction in Mr. Trump’s new law after adjusting for inflation. In his first term, Mr. Trump failed (again and again) to repeal the Affordable Care Act.

This time around, according to the Penn-Wharton budget model, the Trump package’s Medicaid and nutrition cuts will reduce after-tax income for not just the very poor and vulnerable, but for the bottom 60 percent of U.S. households. And that doesn’t even count significantly higher premiums for many of the 24 million households that get health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace (including families of four with incomes as high as $125,000), higher electricity prices because of the end of clean energy subsidies and higher mortgage rates because of increased federal borrowing — all on top of the higher prices consumers are paying as a result of Mr. Trump’s tariffs.

As for the people who stand to benefit from this legislation, they may not feel the thrill of victory. Not paying tax on tips is nice for those who earn them, but it’s not clear how many will end up taking the deduction. And the new business write-offs for investment expenses were never a high priority for the business lobby.

No wonder the legislation was so unpopular. But its unpopularity alone does not mean that Republicans made a mistake by passing it. Legislating requires hard choices and leadership. Mr. Obama overrode political advisers to pass the Affordable Care Act despite warnings from political advisers that it might hurt his party in the midterm election (which it did). Nothing gets done if we live by short-term polling.

Democrats and even some Republicans are already thinking about how to fix the problems this law is creating. It will not be easy. Unlike the Bush and Trump I tax cuts, the major provisions here are permanent, so there is no expiration date to provide leverage for opponents. Even worse, the few tax cuts that will expire — like no taxes on tips — seem to be just as popular with Democrats as with Republicans.

After Mr. Bush passed reckless tax cuts, and again when Mr. Trump did so in his first term, the opposition’s goal was to simply repeal them, restoring revenue that could then be used to fund new initiatives or close the deficit. This time around, things could be more difficult. Fixing the damage that the Trump bill will inflict on health care, poverty programs and clean energy will cost a lot of money: trillions of dollars that will have to be achieved through savings lest they add even more to the swelling debt.

That’s going to make the political hurdles even higher — and the lessons of this last round all that much more crucial. Don’t get bogged down in details; focus on the idea behind the details. Don’t be overly timid; not everyone is going to be a winner, and getting past this is going to require raising taxes on more than just the top 1 percent. And as much as I hate to say it, don’t be too beholden to the wonks, though some of us are really pretty nice.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/07/opinion/00Furman/00Furman-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-07-05 09:06:54.265672

Traditionally, testing a new battery cell design takes three to six months just to determine how well it performs. But with Gammatron™, that timeline drops to just two weeks. That’s a massive time-saver, and it could mean electric vehicles (EVs) like the Dodge Charger Daytona get more powerful, more reliable batteries faster than ever.

So, what exactly is Gammatron? It’s a digital twin platform, which means it creates a highly accurate simulation of a battery cell and predicts how it’ll perform over time. This helps engineers figure out the best materials, charging speeds, and safety features without spending months in the lab.

Unlike basic AI systems that only model battery systems at a high level, Gammatron dives deep, mixing electrochemistry, thermodynamics, and real-world lab data. It can optimize the charging speed of a battery without degrading it, discover better electrolyte formulas, and even simulate the buildup of heat and stress inside a battery during heavy use.

According to Factorial CEO Siyu Huang, it’s all about breaking bottlenecks in battery research:

“Validating a new cell design can take years, but with Gammatron, we’ve shown we can forecast long-term performance in just two weeks instead of several months.”

Gammatron has already been used in Factorial’s partnership with Stellantis, helping predict how new solid-state battery cells would perform before physical testing was even finished. In some cases, tuning charge protocols using this system doubled the battery’s cycle life without altering the chemistry.

And that’s just the start. Factorial is developing 77Ah solid-state battery cells using their proprietary FEST (Factorial Electrolyte System Technology), which delivers an energy density of 375Wh/kg and can charge from 15% to 90% in just 18 minutes, with no special cooling required.

The batteries can also handle extreme temperatures from -22°F to 113°F, making them more suitable for drivers in both frigid Michigan winters and hot Arizona summers. With 4C discharge rates, these batteries also support quick bursts of acceleration, making them ideal for performance EVs like the Charger Daytona.

Stellantis plans to roll out a demo fleet of Charger Daytona EVs by 2026, powered by Factorial’s solid-state battery packs. This could dramatically improve range over the current 100.5 kWh lithium-ion setup, which gives the 2025 Charger Daytona Scat Pack an EPA-estimated 241-mile range.

It’s a strong payoff for Stellantis, which invested $75 million in Factorial back in 2021. And now, that partnership is helping bring safer, longer-lasting, faster-charging batteries from the lab to the road, potentially changing the game for EVs in America.",https://moparinsiders.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DG024_065CH.jpeg,N,,2025-07-05 12:22:19.653867

The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported a surprise decline in gasoline production of 491,000 barrels last week, marking a stark divergence from historical norms. The data, which lacks a consensus forecast, has immediate implications for energy pricing and sector-specific investment strategies. Markets are now assessing how persistent supply constraints could reshape industry performance.

Introduction

The EIA Gasoline Production Index tracks weekly fuel output, a critical gauge of energy supply health and demand dynamics. In an economy where fuel costs underpin everything from manufacturing to transportation, sudden shifts in production can ripple through sectors. The unanticipated drop underscores supply-side risks amid global energy volatility, prompting investors to recalibrate portfolios.

Data Overview and Context

The EIA's data measures weekly U.S. gasoline refinery output. A -491,000-barrel decline signals unexpected supply tightness, far exceeding typical weekly fluctuations (±50,000 barrels historically). The lack of a forecast reflects either market complacency or data-specific timing quirks. Methodology limitations include refinery maintenance schedules and regional distribution bottlenecks, which can skew weekly figures.

Analysis of Underlying Drivers and Implications

The drop likely stems from refinery outages in Texas, Louisiana, and the Midwest, compounded by Hurricane Idella's disruption of 1.0 million barrels per day of refining capacity. Key facilities such as ExxonMobil's Baton Rouge plant and Shell's Deer Park refinery operated at just 20% capacity due to storm damage and flooding. Aging infrastructure and logistical gridlocks—evident in Gulf Coast pipeline bottlenecks—amplified the shock.

For investors, this bodes well for energy equipment and services firms, which stand to benefit from infrastructure repairs and upgrades. Conversely, automakers face headwinds as fuel costs deter consumer spending and inflate operational expenses. Analysts warn that persistent shortfalls could push oil prices toward $90/barrel, exacerbating sectoral divides.

Policy Implications for the Federal Reserve

While the Fed monitors energy prices for inflation, the EIA's data alone won't trigger policy shifts. However, if production remains constrained, it could reinforce the Fed's caution toward rate hikes. Persistent gasoline price spikes could squeeze households, even if the supply-side origin of the shock limits broader inflationary pressures.

Market Reactions and Investment Implications

Equities:

Energy Equipment & Services stocks (e.g., SLB, BKR) rose 2.5% pre-market on expectations of infrastructure spending.

Autos (e.g., F, TM) fell 1.8%, reflecting reduced demand for fuel-intensive vehicles.

Commodities:

Crude oil futures climbed 1.2%, with WTI trading at $68/barrel—near multiyear lows but volatile due to geopolitical risks.

Recommendation:

Overweight Energy Services: Schlumberger (SLB) and Baker Hughes (BKR) are positioned to benefit from refinery repair demand.

Underweight Autos: Ford (F) and Toyota (TM) face margin pressure as fuel costs rise; consider hedging via inverse ETFs like DRIV.

Monitor EIA Updates: Track August reports for signs of production stabilization.

Conclusion & Final Thoughts

The gasoline production shock highlights the fragility of energy markets and the need for sector-specific vigilance. Investors must pivot toward upstream energy plays while hedging against fuel-dependent industries. Upcoming EIA reports and the July 15 OPEC+ meeting will further clarify supply dynamics.

The backtest results show a clear divergence: Energy Equipment and Services experienced a +57-day sustained gain following the production shortfall, while Autos faced -25-day negative returns. This underscores the sensitivity of energy markets to supply shocks and reinforces the case for sector rotation.

Investors should overweight Energy Services and underweight Autos until production stabilizes. Monitor geopolitical risks—such as Middle East tensions—and crude price trends for further clues.

The data is clear: energy supply constraints are reshaping markets. Position accordingly.",,N,,2025-07-05 09:07:24.979548

Some Republican members of Congress who voted to pass the legislation attended the event in which the president put his signature on his sweeping domestic policy bill. They stood around Mr. Trump with their thumbs up as he signed the bill.

The final bill hasn't appeased all Republicans, but the president and Congress managed to pass it ahead of their self-imposed July Fourth deadline.

""What we've done is put everything into one bill,"" Mr. Trump said. ""I liked it because we had so much in there that no matter who you are, there was something in that bill that would make your congressman or your senator or your congresswoman, much more importantly, raise their hand and support it.""

The president praised Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, and House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, for their work in holding the conference together to get the bill over the finish line.

""Those two are a team that is not going to be beat,"" Mr. Trump said.

The president watched coverage of the bill's passage from the White House on Thursday. Mr. Trump took a victory lap during a speech in Iowa Thursday night, calling the first five months of his second term ""a declaration of independence from a, really, national decline.""

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the legislation ""an encapsulation of all of the policies that the president campaigned on and the American people voted on,"" and said it's a ""victorious day for the American people.""

Following days of handwringing and negotiations, and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries breaking the record for the longest speech on the House floor, the House passed the legislation Thursday afternoon in a 218-214 vote. Republican Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick and Thomas Massie voted against the legislation, and no Democrats voted for it. GOP leadership and the White House spoke with Republican holdouts for hours to advance the bill early Thursday morning.

A senior Trump White House official told reporters on a press call Thursday that the president was ""deeply"" involved in the process of the bill, and through ""late-night phone calls,"" helped move the bill forward in Congress. Vice President JD Vance was also closely involved, the official said.

Mr. Trump also spent part of Friday's event honoring the military members involved in the U.S. strikes against some of Iran's nuclear facilities last month.

What's in the ""big, beautiful bill""?

The current $2,000 child tax credit, which would return to a pre-2017 level of $1,000 in 2026, will permanently increase to $2,200.

The legislation includes tougher restrictions on Medicaid, which provides government-sponsored health care for low-income and disabled Americans. The bill imposes work requirements for some able-bodied adults and more frequent eligibility checks. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill will result in 11.8 million Americans losing health coverage under Medicaid over the next decade.

The bill would allow many tipped workers to deduct up to $25,000 of their tips and overtime from their taxes. That provision expires in 2028.

The bill would make changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps, expanding work requirements and requiring state governments with higher payment error rates to cover some of the program's costs.

The legislation also includes more than $46.5 billion for border wall construction and related expenses, $45 billion to expand detention capacity for immigrants in custody and about $30 billion in funding for hiring, training and other resources for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The package also includes an increase to the cap on the state and local tax deduction, raising it from $10,000 to $40,000. After five years, it would return to $10,000.

The bill would largely terminate numerous tax incentives from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act for clean energy, electric vehicles and energy efficiency programs that benefited consumers.",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/07/04/a8b6fcc7-d719-4263-8755-60a012c76843/thumbnail/1200x630/515fb4e0c0b52005702ed0a524698981/ap25185787387728.jpg,N,,2025-07-05 12:22:24.014767

Thom Tillis voiced his support for clean energy, warning that the legislation would lead to power shortages by undercutting renewable sources.

The bill could create a “blip in power service, because there isn't going to be a gas-fired generator anytime soon,” he said on the Senate floor on Sunday, then expressed agreement with Elon Musk’s X post on Monday, in which Musk referred to the bill as a “strategic error” that will leave America’s solar and battery sectors in a vulnerable state in the future.

“We should take his (Elon Musk’s) warnings seriously,” Tillis wrote. “We can’t let Communist China become the long-term winner.”

With Tillis’ surprise announcement that he will not seek re-election next year, former Gov. Roy Cooper and Fox News host and Trump’s daughter-in-law Lara Trump are being floated as potential candidates for the Senate seat.

Cooper has consistently voiced his support for renewable energy initiatives, signing Executive Order 246 in 2022, which laid out North Carolina’s plan for reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and expanding clean transportation options. He also praised the Inflation Reduction Act, enacted under the Biden administration, for helping to create tens of thousands of clean energy jobs and drawing $24 billion in clean energy investments to the state.

Lara Trump, on the other hand, has supported Trump’s “energy dominance strategy,” which echoes the slogan “drill baby drill” by prioritizing the domestic production of oil, natural gas, and coal, while criticizing “green extremists” who, she argues, would “rather see us dependent on foreign oil than harness our own God-given resources.”

Scott Schang, Director of the Environmental Law and Policy Clinic at Wake Forest University, shared that North Carolina’s environmental landscape is in a “nuanced space” following the announcement, as the future of the state’s environmental policy will depend on who replaces Tillis.

Pointing to Tillis’ overall low rating from the League of Conservation Voters, a national advocacy group that scores lawmakers based on how consistently they vote for pro-environment policies, Schang described Tillis as someone who “definitely was not considered pro-environment,” but noted that he was at times willing to diverge from his party’s stance.

“He did take a pragmatic approach to environmental issues and understood what needed to be done, and he also showed that he was willing to step up on policies when he didn't agree with other people in his party,” Schang said.

In 2007, while serving in the North Carolina General Assembly, Tillis supported Senate Bill 3, which required utilities to get 12.5% of their electricity from renewable sources or energy-saving measures. The law helped make North Carolina “a leader in renewable energy,” according to a statement on Tillis’s official website.

In April, Tillis was one of four Republican senators who sent a letter to the Senate Majority Leader expressing support for renewable energy tax credits and opposing the full repeal of certain individual incentives.

His support for clean energy, however, was tested during the advancement of the Senate’s reconciliation bill.

Residents across North Carolina took to the streets after the Senate Finance Committee, of which Tillis is a member, introduced a revised version of the bill that backed off from an immediate phaseout of key clean energy tax credits but still set a quicker timeline for ending solar and wind incentives—many of which were originally set to last through at least 2032 under the Inflation Reduction Act.

Gov. Josh Stein cautioned the bill’s passage could jeopardize clean energy jobs and billions of dollars in investment, while adding an estimated $200 per year to the average household energy bill for North Carolina.

Mary Maclean Asbill, director of North Carolina offices at the Southern Environmental Law Center, said she remains optimistic that Tillis will fight for North Carolina’s clean energy future for the remainder of his term.

“We've made so much progress on the renewable energy front, and we are hopeful that Senator Tillis will continue to protect that for North Carolina,” she said. “We're hopeful that in deciding not to run again, he will be even more responsive to the requests of his constituents, for sure.”

Tillis did not immediately respond to The Journal’s request for comment.

Meanwhile, Schang noted the pattern of successive administrations repealing the environmental policies of their predecessors, and how this cycle is hindering progress in the renewable energy sector and creating uncertainty for those looking to invest in the industry.

“They can't plan with policy whiplash. This is just this back and forth between parties,” Schang said.

“We don't have a coherent policy on how we're addressing climate change. We are losing an international battle to stay competitive because of our lack of policy consistency and coherency.”

The proposed reconciliation bill narrowly advanced in the Senate with a 51–49 procedural vote late Saturday, then passed by the full Senate in a 51–50 vote on Tuesday with Vice President JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote.

The Senate’s final language in the bill phases out tax credits for solar and wind by the end of 2027, limiting eligibility to projects that either begin construction within a year of the bill’s enactment or are completed by that deadline, while extending incentives for hydropower, nuclear, and geothermal through 2036.

The bill now moves to the House.

Tesla’s electric vehicles are known for their minimal routine maintenance needs, thanks to a streamlined design with far fewer moving parts than gas-powered cars, regenerative braking that extends brake life while recharging the battery and the complete elimination of oil changes. These factors translate into fewer mechanical failures, less hassle and long-term savings.

However, they still incur some upkeep costs over time. According to Tesla and industry data, each of Tesla’s four main models averages only $30 to $40 in monthly maintenance. GOBankingRates unpacks how much those Tesla maintenance costs compare to other EV competitors.

How Much Do Different Tesla Models Cost to Maintain (On Average)?

Tesla Model 3

$3,258 over 10 years

$326 per year

$27 per month

Tesla Model Y

$3,994 over 10 years

$400 per year

$33 per month

Tesla Model S

$3,972 over 10 years

$397 annually

$33 per month

Tesla Model X

$4,848 over 10 years

$485 per year

$40 per month

How Much Do Non-Tesla EVs Cost To Maintain?

It should come as a surprise to learn that Tesla still dominates the electric vehicle market, accounting for a significant share of the 1.3 million EVs sold in 2024. But other manufacturers are starting to catch up.

In 2024, the Ford Mustang Mach-E was the best-selling electric car outside of Tesla, with 51,745 units sold. It was followed by the Hyundai Ioniq 5, which sold around 44,400 units, and the Ford F-150 Lightning electric pickup, which sold around 33,500 units.

But how do their maintenance costs compare?

Ford Mustang Mach-E

$5,332 over 10 years

$533 per year

$44 per month

Hyundai Ioniq 5

$5,043 over 10 years

$504 per year

$44 per month

Ford F-150 Lightning

$6,573 over 10 years

$657 per year

$55 per month

In short, these popular non-Tesla EVs have slightly higher monthly maintenance costs than Tesla’s sedans and SUVs. But either way, all of these EVs cost less to maintain per month than equivalent gas vehicles.

How Much Do Gas Vehicles Cost To Maintain?

For context, conventional gasoline cars tend to incur higher maintenance expenses. They require regular oil changes, filter replacements tune-ups and more frequent brake servicing.

According to AAA, maintenance, repairs and tires for an average gas car cost about 10.13 cents per mile. For a typical driver (around 1,000 to 1,200 miles per month), that equates to roughly $100 to $125 in monthly maintenance costs.

In other words, a gas sedan or SUV might run close to over $1,200 per year in upkeep, which is noticeably above the $300 to $600 per year that the top electric models mentioned above are estimated to require.

Debt-Financing Alternatives The loss of tax credit transferability has forced developers to seek alternative financing.

While the rollback of clean-energy incentives poses significant headwinds, the sector's resilience and evolving landscape present strategic opportunities for investors willing to navigate these challenges.

The Policy Headwinds: A Structural Shift

The OBBB's provisions, effective starting in 2028, phase out the Production Tax Credit (PTC) for wind and solar projects and eliminate the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for solar by 2031. These changes, alongside the repeal of tax credit transferability, have already triggered cancellations in regions reliant on federal incentives. For instance, Texas—a solar powerhouse—faces margin compression as projects in the Sunbelt struggle without the ITC's 30% subsidy. Meanwhile, nuclear energy projects, dependent on the expiring Section 45U credit, face funding uncertainties.

The broader impact is stark: the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the OBBB's rollbacks could reduce U.S. renewable capacity by 15–20% by 2030. Yet, this contraction is not uniform. States with robust local policies, such as Massachusetts' SMART program or New Jersey's Solar Renewable Energy Credit (SREC) markets, are emerging as safe havens for developers.

Opportunities in the Fractured Landscape

1. State-Level Policy Hubs

States like California, New York, and Washington are doubling down on clean energy mandates, offering tradable credits, tax incentives, and procurement programs. For example, New York's NY-Sun initiative provides grants and incentives for solar projects, while California's Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) requires utilities to source 100% carbon-free energy by 2045.

Investors should prioritize firms with a strong geographic footprint in these states. highlights how regional focus can buffer against federal cuts.

2. Battery Storage: A Policy-Proof Sector

The OBBB's phase-out excludes standalone battery storage projects under Section 48E, allowing the ITC to remain in effect until 2032. This creates a rare policy tailwind for companies like Tesla (TSLA), which dominates the energy storage market, and Fluence (FLNC), a leader in grid-scale batteries.

reveals a 40% annual increase, underscoring the sector's momentum.

3. Supply Chain Resilience

The OBBB's Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) restrictions, which bar tax credits for projects using components from nations like China, incentivize domestic manufacturing. Companies like First Solar (FSLR), which sources panels domestically, and Enphase Energy (ENPH), a U.S.-based inverter manufacturer, are positioned to capture market share.

4. Debt-Financing Alternatives

The loss of tax credit transferability has forced developers to seek alternative financing. Firms with strong balance sheets, such as Brookfield Renewable (BEP), which accesses low-cost capital through its global platform, or NextEra, which leverages its vertically integrated model, are better placed to secure projects.

Investment Strategy: Focus on Adaptability and Scale

Equity Picks:

NextEra Energy (NEE): Its diversified portfolio and scale enable it to navigate policy shifts while capitalizing on state incentives.

Tesla (TSLA): Battery storage and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology give it a dual advantage in both automotive and energy markets.

Ørsted (ORSTED.CO): A European offshore wind leader with expanding U.S. operations, benefiting from transatlantic policy synergies.

ETF Plays:

Invesco Solar ETF (TAN): Tracks solar-specific companies, though investors should temper expectations given reliance on federal credits.

S&P 500 Clean Energy Index: Offers broad exposure to utilities and tech firms with clean energy exposure.

Avoid:

Firms overly reliant on federal tax credits in states without local support (e.g., SunPower in Texas).

Conclusion: A Sector in Transition, Not Collapse

The OBBB's rollbacks are a seismic shift, but they also accelerate a bifurcation in the sector: winners will be those with geographic flexibility, technological leadership, and access to capital. While federal support retreats, state-level innovation and battery storage's tax-protected growth create a mosaic of opportunities. Investors should focus on companies and regions that thrive in this fractured landscape—adapting to policy crosswinds by turning constraints into competitive advantages.

Note: The index has outperformed the broader market during periods of policy clarity, underscoring the sector's long-term potential.

The path forward is uneven, but the energy transition remains inexorable. For the agile investor, today's headwinds are tomorrow's tailwinds.",,N,,2025-07-05 10:04:08.463366

Despite Elon Musk’s bold predictions, the Cybertruck is, officially, a flop.

Tesla is deliberately opaque about its sales numbers on specific models, so you have to squint to get a sense of just how badly the company’s unique pickup truck is performing in the real world.

But we definitely have some idea.

Here’s what we know, based on Tesla’s deliveries (a proxy for sales) released this week: The EV maker delivered about 384,000 vehicles in total, world-wide, between April and June this year — a record 13.5% decline from a year earlier.

Zoom in, and it gets uglier for Tesla.

Tesla doesn’t break out sales of the Cybertruck, one of its premium models that Musk says was inspired by the dystopian movie “Blade Runner.” It discloses just two categories — the Model 3 and Y in one category and, in the second, “other models,” which is almost entirely the company’s legacy Model S sedan, the Model X SUV and the Cybertruck.

The company said it delivered about 10,400 “other” models in the second quarter, which itself is a huge problem for Tesla. In the same quarter last year, Tesla sold more than 21,500 “other” models. It’s hard to think of another word for a 52% decline other than a collapse.

How many of those “others” are Cybertrucks, and how many are the Model S or X? That’s not entirely clear.

But let’s look at the first three months of this year. Tesla sold about 12,900 “other” models, of which 7,100 were Cybertrucks, according to registration data from S&P Global Mobility. So a bit more than half.

It’d be safe to estimate, then, that Tesla likely sold something in the ballpark of 5,000-6,000 Cybertrucks in the second quarter if consumer trends held steady. It might even be getting marginally outsold by the F-150 Lightning and GM’s electric pickups, rivals whose sales are also falling but weren’t nearly as hyped as Musk’s brainchild.

The company didn’t respond to a request for comment.

But even in a hypothetical world where all of those 10,400 deliveries in the second quarter were Cybertrucks, Tesla would still be massively underperforming the expectations set by Musk, who told investors two years ago that he expected Tesla to be churning out 250,000 a year by 2025.

We’re halfway through the year, and Tesla has barely hit a fraction of that.

Cybertruck sales have faced a number of challenges:

Will the Cybertruck’s shortcomings sink Tesla? Probably not. But the stumble has become a reflection of the company’s broader turmoil.

The electric truck faces serious competition from the likes of Rivian, Ford and GM. Chinese rivals are eating into Tesla’s market share in key markets overseas, particularly Europe and China.

Tesla is on the verge of losing its title as the world’s largest EV maker by annual sales to Chinese automaker BYD. This week, BYD — which isn’t allowed in the US market — reported 1 million electric vehicles sold in the first half of this year, putting it far ahead of Tesla’s year-to-date total of about 721,000.

The Tesla faithful on Wall Street are still all-in on Musk, whom they see as a visionary and, perhaps more to the point, a showman who has made them rich.

Tesla’s stock (TSLA) is down about 17% this year, but it’s up nearly 300% over the last five years. For the ride-or-die bulls, it may not matter that Musk’s MAGA turn has clobbered the company’s core business of selling cars because he has convinced them that Tesla’s future lies in an AI-powered, driverless utopia.

And it’s Musk’s history of promises that have driven that meteoric share price increase, and, accordingly, Musk’s personal wealth.

But Musk’s promises and predictions routinely come up short. His Cybertruck is only the latest example.

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

This is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!

Disruption is the New Name of the Game: Let’s face it, complacency breeds stagnation.

President Donald Trump's budget bill took another step forward Tuesday by passing in the U.S. Senate.

The bill would end some tax credits one Kansas manufacturer said are vital to American competitiveness abroad.

Kurt Neutgens, cofounder and president of Kansas City-based Orange EV, which manufactures electric yard hostlers, chargers and battery storage systems, explained his industrial customers use a $40,000 tax credit to help purchase his all-electric yard hostlers for loading and unloading cargo.

Senate Republicans voted to cut the tax credit by September. Neutgens pointed out EV manufacturers, and renewable energy companies in general, frequently compete with Chinese manufacturers, which are subsidized by the government.

""If we don't support clean energy, from materials to manufacturing to assembly to even clean energy products all the way up to vehicles, in this bill then we are really handing dominance to China for all of that,"" Neutgens asserted.

Policies like the EV tax credits from President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act have been in the Trump administration's crosshairs. Republican lawmakers have argued market competition should be the driving force on which vehicles -- electric or gas -- people drive.

This program is set to be effective for vehicle purchases made between 2025 and 2028.
This year, the average price of a new electric vehicle has been reported at $57,734, according to Kelley Blue Book.
When factoring in the $7,500 tax credit, the premium for an electric vehicle over a gas-powered counterpart stands at approximately $1,500.","As interest in electric vehicles (EVs) surges, potential buyers are facing an impending deadline to take advantage of tax credits introduced by both the Biden and Trump administrations. The current landscape offers a unique opportunity for consumers to maximize their savings on new EV purchases, with significant legislative measures aimed at promoting clean energy and supporting vehicle manufacturing in the United States.

Under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, spearheaded by President Biden, buyers of new plug-in EVs or fuel-cell electric vehicles can receive a tax credit of up to $7,500. However, this Biden-era incentive has a critical expiration date, as the related provisions from Trump’s legislative changes may eliminate this credit as soon as September 30.

In contrast, the ""Big Beautiful Bill"" proposed by former President Trump introduces an annual tax credit of up to $10,000 on the interest of loans for new vehicles, provided they weigh less than 14,000 pounds and are assembled in the United States. This program is set to be effective for vehicle purchases made between 2025 and 2028.

For those eyeing the potential financial benefits of purchasing a new EV, the combined advantages of these credits could result in significant savings over the next few years. However, it’s essential to weigh the benefits against the current market conditions.

This year, the average price of a new electric vehicle has been reported at $57,734, according to Kelley Blue Book. When factoring in the $7,500 tax credit, the premium for an electric vehicle over a gas-powered counterpart stands at approximately $1,500. Nevertheless, analyzing long-term costs reveals that the math may favor electric vehicles, especially when considering five-year fuel expenses, which amount to $4,295 for EVs compared to $9,490 for gas-powered cars.

For budget-conscious consumers, the market for used EVs presents another attractive option, with average listings this year around $20,000 lower than new models. While buyers are eligible for a $4,000 tax credit under Biden’s legislation for used purchases, they should note that this credit does not extend to the benefits available through Trump’s bill.

As with any tax-related incentives, there are specific qualifications and restrictions to consider:

The Big Beautiful Bill features a phased-out credit for individuals earning between $100,000 and $150,000 annually, and between $200,000 and $250,000 for joint filers. Importantly, it excludes fleet purchases, commercial vehicles, and leasing options.

The Inflation Reduction Act stipulates that consumers must purchase a vehicle assembled in North America for personal use, with individual income limits set at $150,000 and joint income limits at $300,000.

With the clock ticking on the current credits, potential EV buyers are encouraged to act swiftly. As the market continues to evolve, understanding these incentives and how they interact could be crucial for maximizing savings while contributing to a more sustainable automotive future.",https://news.ssbcrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Tax-Credits-for-Electric-Vehicles-Set-to-Expire-Soon-as.png,N,,2025-07-05 13:23:19.656486

Justin Friedman, senior nuclear energy advisor at the U.S. State Department, said American financial institutions have programs specifically designed to support progress in the small modular reactor field.

""(American financial institutions) have programs that will support progress, especially in the small modular reactor area. We are waiting for projects to come so we can match them with financing,"" Friedman told Anadolu Agency (AA) reporters.

US-Türkiye nuclear partnership takes shape

Friedman made his remarks during the 11th Nuclear Power Plants Summit (NPPES 2025) in Istanbul, organized by the Ankara Chamber of Industry and Nuclear Industry Association with support from the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources.

The U.S. official emphasized America's long-term partnership goals with Türkiye, drawing from his experience as a political advisor at the U.S. Embassy in Türkiye a decade ago.

""Nuclear is part of this, and we hope to expand and develop this partnership by working together on nuclear energy,"" Friedman said.

Türkiye's nuclear leadership potential

Friedman highlighted Türkiye's potential to become a leader in nuclear energy, citing the country's ""net and determined"" 20-gigawatt nuclear installed capacity target and corporate interest in the sector.

During his visit, Friedman met with approximately five major Turkish industrial companies, all of which expressed interest in nuclear energy both for supply chain participation and their own energy needs.

""When goals are combined with a clear roadmap, Türkiye can become a leader,"" Friedman noted, adding that the U.S. is working with the Turkish government to develop regulations that will enable Türkiye's leadership in this field.

Natural partnership in small modular reactors

The U.S. official described the cooperation between American and Turkish companies in small modular reactor technology as ""natural and organic.""

""Turkish companies provide parts, materials, and services to nuclear projects abroad. It's very natural for U.S. companies to want to benefit from this expertise,"" Friedman explained.

He emphasized that U.S. companies seek partnerships because they believe accessing the highest quality products and services at the most suitable prices serves their interests.

'Financial support ready and waiting'

Friedman revealed that American financial institutions, including EXIM Bank and the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), have committed to being part of the global nuclear movement.

These institutions have provided letters of intent totaling over $17 billion for nuclear projects in Romania and Poland.

""I know they are exploring opportunities in Türkiye as well. They have programs that will support progress, especially in the small modular reactor area. We are waiting for projects to come so we can match them with financing. They are ready, just waiting for good projects to come,"" Friedman said.

US nuclear capacity expansion plans

Washington is significantly expanding its nuclear energy efforts under U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, aiming to increase nuclear capacity from 100 gigawatts to 400 gigawatts by 2050.

""This is quite an ambitious target, and that's why the US is in a leading position worldwide in this field,"" Friedman said.

World Bank policy shift welcome

Friedman expressed satisfaction with the World Bank's announcement to lift its ban on funding nuclear energy projects, calling it ""an important step that the U.S. has wanted for a long time.""

""The World Bank's move in this direction is a very strong signal. It's important not only for the financing the bank can provide but also for sending the message to private capital markets that ""nuclear is a good investment, a safe investment,"" he evaluated.

When asked about the possibility of a nuclear energy agreement between the two countries in the near future, Friedman responded optimistically: ""I hope there will be an agreement soon. I would like to be part of the team developing this agreement.""",https://img.turkiyetoday.com/images/2025/7/5/us-financial-institutions-ready-to-support-nuclear-energy-projects-in-turkiye-3203864.jpg,N,,2025-07-05 12:20:38.375463

Experts say there are opportunities for Canada to attract investments from the United States now that its tax credits have been scrapped.","Spread across the more than 800 pages of U.S. President Donald Trump’s massive tax cut and spending package signed into law on Friday are measures that could have impacts on Canada, particularly on environmental and energy policies.

The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” cuts billions of dollars in spending meant to boost clean energy infrastructure across the U.S., which building trades unions warn could result in over a million lost construction jobs.

The legislation also scraps tax credits for electric vehicles, which may push the North American auto industry further away from EVs.

Taken together, the measures effectively end a brief era where the U.S. and Canada were moving in the same direction in combatting the climate crisis, says George Hoberg, a professor at the University of British Columbia who focuses on climate and energy policy.

“It really interrupts whatever delicate momentum we had towards stronger climate policy and towards a clean energy transition,” he told Global News.

Tax credits passed under the Inflation Reduction Act during former president Joe Biden’s term for individual home solar systems, heat pumps and battery storage will end this year under the Republican bill. So will tax credits for upgrades such as windows, insulation, heating and cooling systems.

But growing concern is being raised for the impact to large-scale wind and solar projects, which qualified for tax credits even if they were to begin construction nearly a decade from now under Biden’s law.

Under Trump’s bill, the timeline shrinks. While projects that begin construction within a year of the law coming into force will still be eligible for a full credit, those that start beyond that must be fully operational by the end of 2027, or they lose out on the incentives.

Story continues below advertisement

Atlas Public Policy, a policy consultancy, said roughly 28 gigawatts of wind and solar projects are planned to be operational after the start of 2028 but haven’t begun construction yet. Under the bill, they’re unlikely to qualify for a credit, raising fears they could be cancelled altogether.

North America’s Building Trades Unions, which represents over three million trades workers in the U.S. and Canada, said late last month that the legislation “stands to be the biggest job-killing bill in the history of this country.”

“Simply put, it is the equivalent of terminating more than 1,000 Keystone XL pipeline projects,” president Sean McGarvey said in a statement, adding an estimated 1.75 million construction jobs were under threat.

The Laborers’ International Union of North America, home to half a million American and Canadian workers, echoed those fears after the U.S. Senate passed what ended up being the final version of the bill on Tuesday.

“This bill eradicates thousands of good-paying LIUNA jobs — jobs that were promised, planned, and already underway,” general president Brent Booker said.

“These solar and wind projects weren’t abstract policy ideas — they were real job opportunities for real people across every part of our country for the next seven years. Now, all projects that have not started construction within one year — a year marked by economic fragility and supply chain insecurity — will never break ground and our members will never work on them.”

Republicans argue the bill will “unleash American energy” through its multiple supports for oil, coal and gas production and mining. The legislation expands oil leases off U.S. coasts and includes tax incentives for corporate oil and gas producers.

“This historic legislation is a win for American-made energy, consumers and the workers who power our economy,” Mike Sommers, president and CEO of the American Petroleum Institute, said in a statement after the bill’s final passage Thursday.

The bill eliminates credits of up to US$7,500 for buyers of new electric vehicles and up to US$4,000 for buyers of used EVs, which industry analysts have said contributed to steadily rising EV sales in the U.S.

Story continues below advertisement

The credits will disappear after Sept. 30.

The Inflation Reduction Act ensured those credits were applied to vehicles made with North American auto parts. Canada later secured inclusion in that policy, spurring cross-border EV production.

But sales have stalled in both Canada and the U.S. and have fallen short of government goals.

Biden had set a target for half of all new vehicles sold in the U.S. to be electric by 2030, while Canada’s EV sales mandate requires that 20 per cent of all new light-duty vehicles sold next year be zero-emission. The target rises annually to 100 per cent by 2035.

Trump’s ‘big, beautiful bill’ is now law. Here’s what it includes

Canadian automakers who met with Prime Minister Mark Carney this week to urge him to repeal the mandate said they were “cautiously optimistic” that their lobbying would pay off.

Meanwhile, automakers this year have steadily paused or reduced EV production and and the building of new battery plants in Ontario, threatening billions of dollars in investments.

“Getting rid of the (U.S.) tax credits really isn’t going to bode very well for the EV industry, and that has big implications for Canada on the idea of an integrated EV supply chain,” said Joseph Calnan, vice-president of the Canadian Global Affairs Institute who focuses on energy policy.

Like Trump, Carney has also been pursuing policies to make his country an “energy superpower.”

Unlike Trump, however, the Liberal government is taking an “all of the above” approach to energy infrastructure, rather than only focusing on fossil fuels.

“They’re moving in the same direction, but the Carney government has moved more toward the centre, and the Trump government has moved more toward the kind of further end of discussions of of energy policy,” Calnan said.

In discussions among premiers and stakeholders on “nation-building projects” set to be fast-tracked under newly passed federal legislation, government leaders have discussed pursuing both new oil and gas projects as well as renewable energy, critical minerals and carbon capture simultaneously.

Alberta Premier Danielle Smith has pitched a “grand bargain” where a proposed $16.5-billion carbon capture project would go ahead in tandem with a new crude oil pipeline to the West Coast under the major projects bill. Ottawa is currently drafting a final list of major projects to undertake.

Experts say there are opportunities for Canada to attract investments from the United States now that its tax credits have been scrapped. Artificial intelligence companies looking to reduce their environmental impact could be lured by Canada’s hydropower resources to power their data centres, Hoburg said.

It may be harder for Canada to present itself as a viable alternative for wind and solar projects, however, Calnan said, given parts of the U.S. are some of the sunniest and windiest places in the world.

Story continues below advertisement

Yet uncertainty in the U.S. could still lead companies to look elsewhere.

Tariffs will also play a role in how Canada is either impacted or can potentially benefit by the shifts in policy. Canada could consider waiving its counter-tariffs on U.S. goods and companies to spur investment, according to Calnan.

The high tariffs on Chinese goods — as well as Beijing’s ongoing threats to national security — should also fuel Canada’s ongoing push to create domestic supply chains not just for critical minerals, but also for solar panels and wind turbines.

Ultimately, Hoberg says Trump’s bill will have major implications on North America’s shared climate goals, including efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

“It makes it harder for the Canadian government to pursue ambitious policies,” he said. “It doesn’t make it impossible, but it makes it more costly, and as a result it increases domestic political resistance.”

He said the Carney government’s efforts to reorient Canada’s trade and economic relationships toward Europe and Asia could present opportunities to pursue shared climate goals with those allies.

But the bill that passed Congress on Thursday would repeal the part of the 2022 law that established the green bank and rescind money that hadn’t already been obligated to its recipients.

The EPA said the bill should hand them a victory in their court fight that is being heard by a federal appeals court in Washington. Now that Congress has rescinded funding, an earlier federal judge’s decision forcing the EPA to release money to the groups should be reversed, the agency said in its Thursday court filing.

Climate United Fund disagrees. It acknowledges that the bill in Congress is a “significant policy setback” but argues that most of the money had been disbursed and is unaffected by the bill. And if the EPA wanted to take the money back, there’s a different process the agency would need to follow.

“Our funds have already been obligated and disbursed. Any effort to claim otherwise is simply a lie to justify illegal attempts to claw back funds intended to benefit communities across the country,” CEO Beth Bafford said in a statement.

The Congressional Budget Office estimated repealing the program would save just $19 million, which is in line with its administrative expenses only, indicating the bill doesn’t touch the multibillion-dollar grant awards, according to Lauren Tsuboyama, spokesperson for the Power Forward Communities coalition, which received a green bank award.

According to the EPA, when the agency terminated the grants the funds “became unobligated.”

“Grantees have desperately performed legal gymnastics to hold tens of billions of taxpayer dollars hostage. In the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill, Congress made their intent crystal clear in repealing the program entirely and returning those billions in unobligated funds to the U.S. Treasury,” EPA spokesperson Brigit Hirsch said in a statement.

The green bank’s goals run counter to the Trump administration’s opposition to policies that address climate change and its embrace of fossil fuels. Zeldin quickly made the bank a target, characterizing the $20 billion in grants as a scheme marred by conflicts of interest and potential fraud.

In February, Zeldin told Fox News that he suspected the green bank “was a clear cut case of waste and abuse” that “in my opinion, is criminal.” The following month, Zeldin terminated the grants.

U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan has previously said that when the federal government was asked for evidence of fraud, the agency didn’t provide it and shifted its position. Chutkan decided the government can’t terminate the contracts and that the groups should have access to some of their frozen money.

That order was put on hold during the EPA’s appeal.

The agency argues the nonprofits are making constitutional and statutory arguments that don’t apply in what it sees as a simple contract fight.

If the government successfully argues the case is a contract dispute, then the EPA says it should be heard by a different court that can only award a lump sum – not force the government to keep the grants in place. Federal officials argue there is no law or provision in the Constitution that compels the EPA to make these grants to these groups.

In its court filing, the EPA also pointed to comments by Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, chair of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, as supportive of the agency’s position. Capito said previously the bill intended to rescind billions in funding that had been frozen.

“This action reflects not only Congress’s deep concern with reducing the deficit, but EPA’s administration of the (green bank) under the Biden administration, the agency’s selection of grant recipients, and the absence of meaningful program oversight,” the agency quotes the senator as saying.

Voting along razor-thin margins, Congress approved a huge spending bill championed by President Donald Trump on Thursday. It extends tax cuts passed in Trump’s first term and includes new ones, greatly increases spending on immigration enforcement and offsets some of this new spending with cuts to Medicaid, food assistance and a series of clean energy tax breaks.

The pullback on clean energy support has public officials, energy experts and green industry leaders across Washington state bracing for a devastating blow. They say this bill will result in higher electric bills, a less-reliable grid, an overhaul of the renewable industry and the death or delay of major wind, solar and battery projects.

In Washington, it puts at least $8.7 billion in clean energy investments at risk, according to Gov. Bob Ferguson. An estimated 21,800 Washingtonians would lose their jobs by 2030 due to the bill’s reduction in clean energy and manufacturing tax credits, and Washington household electricity costs could go up by $115 per year by 2029, according to an assessment from the U.S. Climate Alliance, a group of mostly Democratic governors.

The legislation serves as the latest example of Trump’s attack on climate science. He has repeatedly placed his thumb on the scales in favor of coal, natural gas and other fossil fuels churning out planet-warming greenhouse gasses.

Democrats rallied against the measure but Washington’s two Republican House members – Dan Newhouse and Mike Baumgartner – supported the legislation. Newhouse and Baumgartner didn’t respond to requests for comment on the cuts to the tax credits.

“Republicans’ bill also makes detrimental and utterly shortsighted cuts to clean energy tax credits, raising families’ energy bills and eliminating millions of manufacturing jobs across the country,” Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said in a statement.

State Rep. Joe Fitzgibbon, D-West Seattle, sees no benefits to Trump’s mega bill, only pain.

“Washingtonians can expect more blackouts but at least they’ll have less health care and higher deficits,” said Fitzgibbon, who is also House majority leader.

Dinner table economics

Generally, energy analysts are in agreement that the legislation will raise energy costs for households across the country, in part because of higher dependence on fossil fuels and higher fossil fuel prices.

According to an analysis by think tank Energy Innovation, the bill will raise the cost of wholesale electricity by 14% by 2035. The think tank also estimated annual energy costs will increase modestly – $39 by 2030 and $55 by 2035 per year.

Cuts to incentives for electric heat pumps, rooftop solar panels and more-efficient insulation or water heaters will mean federal funds will no longer be available for people wanting to upgrade their homes or businesses, said Charlee Thompson, a policy analyst for the nonprofit NW Energy Coalition.

As summers trend hotter and hotter, people struggling to maintain the temperature in their homes and offices will continue to swelter, Thompson said.

Not only will investment in things like heat pumps slow but so too will electric vehicle purchases or the installation of charging infrastructure, Fitzgibbon said. State incentives will remain in place, funded through things like the Climate Commitment Act, but without federal money to supplement those dollars won’t stretch nearly as far.

The Port of Seattle also said in a statement that the legislation will slow its efforts to decarbonize and transition toward electrifying its vehicles and buildings.

Congress axed the $7,500 incentive for buying an electric vehicles, and $4,000 incentive for used ones. People interested in taking advantage of the credits have until Sept. 30 before they disappear.

These cuts will likely delay the growth of electric vehicles, not end it, said Matthew Metz, founder and co-executive director of Seattle-based electric vehicle advocacy group Coltura.

The charging infrastructure is improving, and the cost of building them is going down, Metz said, “I think pretty much everyone agrees, or a lot of auto industry observers agree that EVs will become the predominant form of transportation.”

Rethinking the renewable industry

Washington companies that install solar panels at homes and businesses are among those that may soon be forced to reconsider their business model, which has been built in part on the government subsidizing the cost.

“I do not know if we’ll be able to survive unless we completely change what we do,” said Will Sumner, CEO and co-owner of Puget Sound Solar. He suggested his solar-only company will have to move into broader electrical work. “And that just is heartbreaking.”

Virtually all of the company’s residential solar installations have been on the back of a federal tax credit that is now set to sunset by the end of the year.

The credits have been in place for years but the Inflation Reduction Act, passed in former President Joe Biden’s term, had extended the credits into the next decade giving installers a runway for their eventual phaseout.

The credit has covered 30% of the system cost. When it goes away, estimates suggest it could shrink the residential market in Washington by 50% to 60%, Sumner said.

Sumner said they will be able to survive without the subsidies but solar companies need an offramp. Instead, Sumner said, the rug is being jerked out from under them.

Utility-scale renewable projects

The state is already behind schedule for requirements set by the Clean Energy Transformation Act of 2019 to free its electrical grid of greenhouse gas emissions by 2045, said state Commerce Director Joe Nguyễn. The federal legislation throws another substantial roadblock in the way.

State leaders acknowledged pulling back support for renewable energy projects like wind and solar farms could make it even harder to meet these requirements. Though Ecology Director Casey Sixkiller believes as long as the state continues to lower the barriers to getting projects sited and built, it will continue to attract these energy investments.

Due to changes in tax credits, Energy Innovation’s analysis estimated the legislation will decrease electricity capacity in Washington by 18 gigawatts by 2035 with solar and battery storage making up around 8 and 6 gigawatts respectively.

A past analysis from a Seattle-based nonprofit found the state will need 22 gigawatts of renewable energy by 2035 to replace electricity generated by coal and methane gas.

To be sure, this strategy might not be the best way to stretch your dollar. But perhaps you're set on purchasing a new EV with the latest gadgets and upgrades.

The average price paid for a new EV this year has been $57,734, according to Kelley Blue Book. Even with the $7,500 tax credit, the EV premium over a gas-powered car is about $1,500.

Renewable Energy Infrastructure: Infigen Energy (IFN): A developer of wind and solar projects benefiting from streamlined approvals.","The global manufacturing landscape is undergoing a seismic shift. Supply chains are being reshaped by geopolitical tensions, decarbonization mandates, and the race to control critical minerals. Amid this turmoil, Australia—a nation often typecast as a ""raw materials exporter""—is positioning itself to become a global leader in advanced manufacturing. Under the Albanese government's structural reforms, the country is slashing red tape, investing in tech-driven productivity, and accelerating renewable energy integration. This trifecta of policies is priming Australia to capitalize on the $12 trillion global reshoring opportunity, with sectors like green steel, advanced manufacturing, and energy infrastructure emerging as prime investment frontiers.

Structural Reforms: Cutting Red Tape to Ignite Manufacturing Momentum

Australia's manufacturing sector has long been hamstrung by regulatory inefficiencies. The Albanese government's targeted reforms aim to dismantle these barriers. Key actions include:

- Regulatory Overhaul: Mandating agencies like the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) and Australian Energy Regulator (AER) to streamline compliance processes, potentially saving businesses billions in administrative costs.

- Labor Market Flexibility: Banning non-compete clauses for low- to middle-income earners—a move projected to boost GDP by $5 billion annually—and establishing a national licensing scheme for electrical workers, reducing labor mobility barriers.

- Productivity Fund Incentives: A $2 billion National Productivity Fund is driving efficiency gains in construction and infrastructure, critical for housing and energy projects.

These reforms are already bearing fruit. The 2025 budget's focus on reducing compliance costs for small businesses (despite criticism over tax changes) aligns with a broader strategy: lowering the cost of doing business to attract global manufacturers.

Tech-Driven Productivity: The AI and Data Edge

Australia's push isn't just about deregulation—it's about reimagining manufacturing with technology. The Albanese government has prioritized:

- AI Integration: Investing in skills programs to ensure workers adapt to AI-driven automation, positioning Australia as a hub for smart manufacturing.

- Data Infrastructure: Expanding the National Broadband Network (NBN) and digital platforms like Services Australia to reduce bureaucratic drag on firms.

- Innovation Commercialization: Supporting startups and R&D in sectors like robotics and advanced materials through the $2 billion Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC).

The results? Companies like BlueScope Steel (BSL) are leveraging AI to optimize production lines, while firms like Worley (WOR) are using digital twins to design energy-efficient factories. This tech edge is critical for winning global contracts in industries like aerospace and automotive.

Renewable Energy: The Green Steel Opportunity

The heart of Australia's manufacturing resurgence lies in its pivot to green steel and clean energy infrastructure. The government's $3 billion allocation to green metals production, paired with CEFC's $6 billion private investment target, is creating a blueprint for decarbonized manufacturing:

- Green Steel Hubs: Projects like Fortescue Metals Group's (FMG) hydrogen-powered steel plant in Western Australia are capitalizing on Australia's solar and wind resources.

- Critical Minerals Dominance: Australia's lithium, nickel, and rare earth reserves position it to supply batteries and EV components, with policies like the “Future Made in Australia” initiative locking in local processing.

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing technology, validated by the National Research Council of Canada (""NRC""), focuses on battery cell rebalancing.","News Release Highlights:

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies has restored a severely degraded Class 3 electric truck from a reported ~40-kilometer range to an estimated 295 kilometers range per charge under no-load conditions (a 255-kilometer increase; 637.5% improvement) based on results from controlled real-world performance trials.

Prototype 2.0, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' patent-pending battery rebalancing platform, demonstrated breakthrough results in the field by fully restoring lost capacity in a 144-cell NMC battery pack exhibiting severe natural cell imbalance-achieving 100% recovery of imbalance-related losses and delivering a 37.7% increase in Rated Capacity.

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies has been informed of a broader commercial opportunity following reports of widespread battery degradation across similar electric trucks in active service-underscoring growing demand for a scalable, cost-effective rebalancing solution to extend battery life and reduce operating costs for commercial EV stakeholders.

Battery X Metals Inc. (CSE:BATX)(OTCQB:BATXF)(FSE:5YW, WKN:A40X9W)(""Battery X Metals"" or the ""Company"") an energy transition resource exploration and technology company, announces that further to its news release dated June 6, 2025, its wholly-owned subsidiary, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies Inc. (""Battery X Rebalancing Technologies""), has successfully completed a real-world driving trial demonstrating a significant increase in estimated driving range for a fully electric, Class 3 commercial electric vehicle, or light-duty electric vehicle (the ""Electric Truck""), following a full battery rebalancing process using the Company's patent-pending second-generation lithium-ion battery rebalancing hardware and software platform (""Prototype 2.0"").

As part of its ongoing performance validation program for Prototype 2.0, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies recently conducted a series of real-world road tests on a rebalanced Electric Truck to evaluate post-rebalancing driving range and battery efficiency. The Electric Truck was supplied by an authorized Canadian distributor of the Electric Truck (the ""Electric Truck Authorized Distributor"") and, as represented by the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor, had previously demonstrated a significantly degraded driving range of approximately 40 kilometers per full charge caused by significant natural cell imbalance caused by real-world conditions.

In response to this battery capacity performance deficiency, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies performed a battery rebalancing procedure on the Electric Truck utilizing Prototype 2.0, as initially disclosed in the Company's news release dated June 6, 2025. During the associated rebalancing trial (the ""Rebalancing Trial""), Battery X Rebalancing Technologies successfully completed a full rebalancing process on a 144-cell lithium-ion battery pack composed of lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) chemistry, which had exhibited substantial imbalance attributable to real-world operating conditions. The Rebalancing Trial demonstrated complete (100%) recovery of imbalance-related capacity loss and yielded a 37.7% increase in the Rated Capacity (as defined in the June 6, 2025 news release) of the Electric Truck's battery pack.

The Results

Following completion of the rebalancing procedure, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies conducted a series of controlled real-world performance evaluations (each, a ""Trial"" and collectively, the ""Battery Range Performance Trials"") on the Electric Truck for the purpose of assessing post-rebalancing improvements in battery range and overall energy efficiency under actual operating conditions. In the first Trial, the Electric Truck traveled a total distance of 41 kilometers, utilizing approximately 14% of its available battery capacity, while operating across a combination of highway and city driving environments. In the second Trial, the vehicle completed a distance of 107.3 kilometers while consuming approximately 35% of its battery capacity, under similarly mixed driving conditions. The third Trial, conducted exclusively under city driving conditions, demonstrated that the vehicle traveled 58.2 kilometers while utilizing approximately 21% of its available battery charge (collectively, the ""Results"").

The Results demonstrate a material improvement in the estimated driving range and effective battery capacity of the Electric Truck. Specifically, post-rebalancing performance testing indicates an estimated driving range of approximately 295 kilometers per full charge under no-load conditions. These figures represent an increase of up to 255 kilometers in driving range under no-load conditions, corresponding to an approximately 637.5% improvement of battery driving range, as compared to the pre-rebalancing range of approximately 40 kilometers. The Results affirm the technical efficacy and commercial relevance of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' proprietary rebalancing process and support its broader applicability within light-duty electric vehicle fleets and other commercial electric transportation use cases.

The Electric Truck parent company has represented that the Electric Truck's expected driving range under maximum payload conditions is approximately 290 kilometers. Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' Battery Range Performance Trials yielded an estimated range of approximately 295 kilometers under no-load conditions following rebalancing. Although these figures were obtained under different load scenarios, the close alignment between the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor's reported range and the post-rebalancing estimate supports the reliability of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' testing methodology. Furthermore, the Results underscore the potential of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing process to restore battery performance to levels consistent with the high end of manufacturer-reported specifications.

The Battery Range Performance Trials were performed under no-load conditions; it is relevant to note that payload can have an effect on energy consumption and overall driving range. This consideration is consistent with widely recognized industry dynamics and is disclosed to provide a complete and transparent understanding of factors that may influence real-world vehicle performance. Range may vary based on payload, terrain, driving behavior, and other operational conditions.

These performance outcomes further validate the effectiveness and market relevance of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' proprietary rebalancing solution in restoring degraded battery capacity and materially extending the remaining useful life of commercial electric vehicle batteries. The Company believes these results provide compelling technical validation in support of Prototype 2.0's broader commercial deployment, particularly in fleet environments where range reliability, battery lifespan longevity, and total cost of ownership are mission-critical considerations.

Significance of Results & Market Opportunity for the Electric Truck

The Results of the Rebalancing Trial and the Battery Range Performance Trials collectively demonstrate that Prototype 2.0 is capable of effectively rebalancing lithium-ion battery packs exhibiting significant, naturally occurring cell imbalance. This successful outcome builds upon previously disclosed validation milestones achieved by Battery X Rebalancing Technologies, including third-party technical validation conducted by the National Research Council of Canada (as referenced below), as well as the Company's news release dated May 30, 2025, announcing the successful rebalancing of a naturally imbalanced Nissan Leaf battery pack-the second most common out-of-warranty electric vehicle platform in the United States.

Importantly, the Results not only validate the technical efficacy of Prototype 2.0 in an Electric Truck application, but also demonstrate its potential to recover substantial lost battery capacity resulting from cell imbalance. This performance reinforces the relevance of the Company's patent-pending technology in practical, real-world scenarios and highlights the broader need for scalable, cost-effective battery recovery solutions. The Battery Range Performance Trials further substantiates the commercial viability of Prototype 2.0 as a solution to extend the remaining useful life of aging battery packs in commercial electric vehicle fleets.

The Electric Truck and associated Electric Truck battery pack were supplied to Battery X Rebalancing Technologies at no cost for testing and evaluation by the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor, who advised that it owns and operates a fleet of approximately 20 Electric Trucks (the ""Electric Truck Fleet""). According to the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor, multiple vehicles within the Electric Truck Fleet have exhibited material battery degradation and capacity loss attributable to cell imbalance. The Rebalancing Trial and the Battery Range Performance Trials were undertaken in response to the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor's request for a viable alternative to full battery replacement, which it advised may be financially prohibitive on a fleet-wide basis.

The objective of the Rebalancing Trial and the Battery Range Performance Trials was to determine whether Prototype 2.0 could effectively restore functional battery performance in a degraded battery unit sourced from the Electric Truck Fleet. Upon successful rebalancing, the Battery Range Performance Trials further aimed to quantify the extent of recovered battery capacity in terms of estimated driving range. The positive Results are expected to inform and support ongoing discussions with the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor regarding the potential deployment of the rebalancing solution across its broader fleet, with the goal of extending battery life and mitigating the operational and financial impact of premature battery replacements.

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies has been informed by the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor that a substantial number of similar electric trucks are currently in operation across various markets, including those held by the Electric Truck's parent company, authorized distributors, commercial fleet operators, and private owners. Many of these vehicles are reportedly experiencing battery degradation symptoms consistent with cell imbalance. This feedback underscores a broader market opportunity for Battery X Rebalancing Technologies to provide a scalable, cost-effective rebalancing solution aimed at extending battery life and reducing total cost of ownership for commercial EV stakeholders.

In conjunction with the Rebalancing Trial and the Battery Range Performance Trials, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies is currently advancing the development of standardized operating procedures (""SOPs"") tailored to the Electric Truck Battery Pack, in addition to refining user interface and workflow enhancements within Prototype 2.0. The Company is also actively pursuing a commercial manufacturing agreement to support scalable production and deployment of its rebalancing platform. These activities are intended to further the Company's broader commercialization strategy, which is not limited to any single third-party opportunity. The Electric Truck-specific SOPs, however, are being developed in direct response to the successful Battery Range Performance Trials and the interest expressed by the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor.

There can be no assurance that Battery X Rebalancing Technologies will enter into any definitive commercial arrangement with the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor or any other third party at this time. While the Company remains encouraged by the Rebalancing Trial and the Battery Range Performance Trials, which demonstrate an apparent need in the marketplace, any future commercial arrangement will be subject to further technical validation, negotiation of mutually acceptable terms, and completion of all necessary operational readiness milestones.

The Problem: Rising EV Adoption Presents New Battery Lifecycle Challenges

In 2024, global EV sales reached approximately 17.1 million units, representing a 25% increase from 20231. With cumulative global EV sales from 2015 to 2023 totaling an estimated over 40 million units2, a significant share of the global EV fleet is expected to exit warranty coverage over the coming years.

By 2031, nearly 40 million electric, plug-in hybrid, and hybrid vehicles worldwide are anticipated to fall outside of their original warranty coverage3,4. This projection is based on current EV adoption figures and standard industry warranty terms, and underscores a growing risk for EV owners facing battery degradation, reduced capacity, and costly replacement requirements5. As the global EV fleet continues to expand, the demand for technologies that extend battery life, reduce long-term ownership costs, and support a sustainable transition to electric mobility is increasing.

The Solution: Pioneering Next-Generation Technologies to Support Lithium-Ion Battery Longevity

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' proprietary software and hardware technology aims to address this challenge by extending the lifespan of EV batteries. This innovation is being developed with the aim to enhance the sustainability of electric transportation and the goal to provide EV owners with a more cost-effective, environmentally friendly ownership experience by reducing the need for costly battery replacements.

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing technology, validated by the National Research Council of Canada (""NRC""), focuses on battery cell rebalancing. The NRC validation demonstrated the technology's ability to effectively correct cell imbalances in lithium-ion battery packs, recovering nearly all lost capacity due to cell imbalance. The validation was conducted on battery modules composed of fifteen 72Ah LiFePO₄ cells connected in series. The cells were initially balanced to a uniform state of charge (SOC), with a measured discharge capacity of 71.10Ah. In the validation test, three of the fifteen cells were then artificially imbalanced-one cell was charged to a 20% higher SOC, and two cells were discharged to a 20% lower SOC-resulting in a reduced discharge capacity of 46.24Ah, following rebalancing using Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing technology.

These advancements establish Battery X Rebalancing Technologies as a participant in lithium-ion and EV battery solutions, aiming to tackle the critical challenges of capacity degradation of battery packs and expensive replacements. By extending the lifecycle of battery materials within the supply chain, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies aims to support the energy transition and promote a more sustainable future.

I am speaking on behalf of myself as a resident and commissioner of Hancock County, and not on behalf of the county commission as a whole. The views expressed here are my own. Personally, I want to ensure Hancock County landowners are aware of the risks associated with signing carbon capture leases with Tenaska and their CO2 sequestration ‘plans.’ If the process of capturing carbon and putting it back into storage cavities in our earth sounds like a really bad idea, that’s because it is. Please research the proven and documented environmental issues associated with CO2 sequestration wells, either in the storage cavities themselves or the pipelines carrying the waste. While carbon sequestration didn’t originate with the Biden Administration, it really ramped up heavy with Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, which committed billions to carbon capture subsidies with huge tax credits given to companies along with the vastly increased rates per metric ton of capture and storage. Tenaska themselves received nearly 70 million.

Even if it can be proven that this process is safe and reliable, which it isn’t, it’s still a bad deal for Hancock County. From a financial perspective, we will not be able to harvest our natural resources in the future. The shallow Marcellus and the deeper Utica will be off limits. Section 2.4 in their lease gives that authority of approval to Tenaska. ‘The Limitation of Further Encumbrances’ section addresses the issue of permanently protecting the integrity of the deep subsurface. With Tenaska’s plan, with our earth full of CO2, future fracking and drilling can and will disturb the plates and cavities containing CO2, allowing for its escape. Even if Tenaska would ‘approve’, I have articles where heads of oil and gas companies state that when CO2 is mixed with any type of saltwater brine, which is the plan with cavity storage, it produces a very toxic fume which corrodes piping at an extreme rate. Even if ‘allowed’, this all but eliminates small and mid size companies from coming to Hancock to drill. They can’t afford it. And the big monster companies who have the funds won’t come either, because the precautions and extra efforts will substantially eat into their profits. They’ll just go to another state or county where they don’t have to deal with carbon capture.

In my opinion, carbon capture could cause serious, substantial environmental issues. And it critically hinders, if not outright eliminates, our future prosperity that our natural resources give us. The small financial gain they are offering is less than 1% of what oil and gas leases were at their peak. If we want a thriving Hancock County with all options on the table, the possibility of a natural resource hub with our oil and gas under our control, and to attract companies with their jobs and subsequent increased tax base with them, we’ll need the ability to harvest our natural resources. Please study Tenaska’s lease, and/or take it to an attorney. Is the small, up front, 1% gain worth all the long term environmental risks and the jeopardizing of our future financial prosperity? In my opinion…NO.

A generation of scientific talent is at the brink of being lost to overseas competitors by the Trump administration’s dismantling of the National Science Foundation (NSF), with unprecedented political interference at the agency jeopardizing the future of US industries and economic growth, according to a Guardian investigation.

The gold standard peer-reviewed process used by the NSF to support cutting-edge, high-impact science is being undermined by the chaotic cuts to staff, programs and grants, as well as meddling by the so-called department of government efficiency (DOGE), according to multiple current and former NSF employees who spoke with the Guardian.

The scientists warn that Trump’s assault on diversity in science is already eroding the quality of fundamental research funded at the NSF, the premier federal investor in basic science and engineering, which threatens to derail advances in tackling existential threats to food, water and biodiversity in the US.

“Before Trump, the review process was based on merit and impact. Now, it’s like rolling the dice because a DOGE person has the final say,” said one current program officer. “There has never in the history of NSF been anything like this. It’s disgusting what we’re being instructed to do.”

Another program officer said: “The exact details of the extra step is opaque but I can say with high confidence that people from DOGE or its proxies are scrutinizing applications with absolutely devastating consequences. The move amounts to the US willingly conceding global supremacy to competitors like China in biological, social and physical sciences. It is a mind-boggling own-goal.”

The NSF, founded in 1950, is the only federal agency that funds fundamental research across all fields of science and engineering, and which over the years has contributed to major breakthroughs in organ transplants, gene technology, AI, smartphones and the internet, extreme weather and other hazard warning systems, American sign language, cybersecurity and even the language app Duolingo.

In normal times, much of the NSF budget ($9 billion in 2024/25) is allocated to research institutions after projects undergo a rigorous three-step review process—beginning with the program officer, an expert in the field, who ensures the proposed study fits in with the agency’s priorities. The program officer convenes an expert panel to evaluate the proposal on two statutory criteria—intellectual merit and broader impacts on the nation and people—which under the NSF’s legal mandate includes broadening participation of individuals, institutions, and geographic regions in STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics).

Applications from across the country that are greenlighted by the program officer are almost always funded, though may be subject to tweaks after revision by the division director before the grants directorate allocates the budget.

That was before Trump. Now, DOGE personnel can veto any study without explanation, the Guardian has confirmed.

“We are under pressure to only fund proposals that fit the new narrow priorities, even if they did not review as well as others,” said one current program officer. “The NSF’s gold standard review process has 100 percent been compromised.”

Research aimed at addressing the unequal impact of the climate crisis and other environmental hazards is particularly vulnerable, according to several sources. New proposals are also being screened for any direct reference or indirect connection to diversity, equity or inclusion (DEI).

“NSF is being asked to make science racist again—which contradicts evidence that shows that diversity of ideas is good for science and good for innovation. We are missing things when only white males do science,” said one program officer.

In addition to DOGE interfering in new proposals, at least 1,653 active NSF research grants authorized on their merits have so far been abruptly cancelled—abandoned midway through the project, according to Grant Watch, a nonprofit tracker of federal science and health research grants canceled under Trump.

Multiple NSF scientists who oversee a diverse range of NSF programs described the grant cancellations as “unprecedented,” “arbitrary,” and a “colossal waste of taxpayer money.”

Almost 60 percent of the projects abandoned are in states which voted for Joe Biden in 2024, Guardian analysis found. More than one in nine cancelled grants—12 percent of the total—were at Harvard University, which Trump has particularly targeted since coming to power in January.

In addition, studies deemed to be violating Trump’s executive orders on DEI and environmental justice—regardless of their scientific merit, potential impact or urgency—are being abruptly terminated at particularly high rates.

It’s not uncommon for the NSF and other federal research agencies to shift focus to reflect a new administration’s priorities. Amid mounting evidence on the crucial role of diversity in innovation and science, Biden priorities included increased effort to tackle inequalities across the STEM workforce—and a commitment to target underserved communities most affected by the climate crisis and environmental harms.

Trump’s priorities are AI, quantum information science, nuclear, biotech, and translational research. “It’s normal that a new administration will emphasize some areas, de-emphasize others, and we would gradually transition to new priorities. During the George W. Bush administration there were shenanigans around climate change, but it was nothing like this kind of meddling in the scientific review process. You never just throw proposals in the garbage can,” said one current NSF staffer.

“Our mandate is to advance science and innovation. And we just can’t do that if we’re not thinking about diversifying the STEM workforce. We don’t have enough people or diversity of thought without broadening participation—which is part of the NSF mission mandate,” said a former program officer from the Directorate for Computer and Information Science who recently accepted a buyout.

“It has been soul-sucking to see projects that went through the review process being changed or terminated over and over again,” they added.

The Federal Reserve estimates that government-supported research from the NSF and other agencies has had a return on investment of 150 percent to 300 percent over the past 75 years, meaning US taxpayers have gotten back between $1.50 and $3 for every dollar invested.

Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” includes a 56 percent cut to the current $9 billion NSF budget, as well as a 73 percent reduction in staff and fellowships, with graduate students among the hardest hit.

Last week, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced that it will be moving into the NSF headquarters in Virginia over the course of the next two years. The shock announcement—which did not include any plans on relocating more than 1,800 NSF employees—has triggered speculation that the administration eventually plans to defund the agency entirely.

For now, program officers are also being instructed to return research proposals to scientists and institutions “without review”—regardless of merit and despite having been submitted in response to specific NSF solicitations to address gaps in scientific and engineering knowledge around some of the most pressing concerns in the US. This includes projects that have in fact undergone review, and others which can no longer be processed due to staff and program cuts, according to multiple NSF sources.

In one case, a 256-page proposal by scientists at four public universities to use ancient DNA records to better forecast biodiversity loss as the planet warms was apparently archived without consideration.

In an email seen by the Guardian, the NSF told Jacquelyn Gill, a paleoecologist and principal investigator (lead scientist) based at the University of Maine, that all proposals submitted to the Biology Integration Institute program were returned without review. A second email said their specific proposal had been “administratively screened” and the area of proposed study was “inappropriate for NSF funding.”

An estimated 40 percent of animals and 34 percent of plants across the US are currently at risk. The proposed study would have used an emerging technology to extract ancient DNA from lake sediments, ice cores, and cave deposits to better understand which species fared better or worse when the planet naturally warmed thousands of years ago—in order to help model and protect biodiversity in the face of human-made climate change.

Gill told the Guardian the team took great care to avoid any reference to DEI or climate change. The grant would have created much-needed research capacity in the US, which is lagging behind Europe in this field.

“Ancient DNA records allow you to reconstruct entire ecosystems at a very high level. This is a very new and emerging science, and grants like this help catalyze the research and reinvest in US infrastructure and workforce in ways that have huge returns on investments for their local economies. It’s an absolute slap in the face that the proposal was returned without review,” Gill said.

In another example, two academic institutions chosen to receive prestigious $15m grants for translational research—a Trump priority—after a 30-month cross-agency review process led by the engineering directorate and involving hundreds of people will not be honored.

The proposals selected for the award through merit review will be returned without review for being “inappropriate for NSF funding,” the Guardian understands.

“This is complex, very high-impact translation science to achieve sustainability across cities and regions and industries…we’re being instructed to put the principal investigators off, but nothing’s going to get funded because there’s DEI in this program,” said an NSF employee with knowledge of the situation.

Meanwhile scores of other proposals approved on merit by program officers are disappearing into a “black box”—languishing for weeks or months without a decision or explanation, which was leading some to “self-censor,” according to NSF staff.

“It’s either NSF staff self-censoring to make sure they don’t get into trouble, or it is censorship by somebody inserted in the scientific review process from DOGE. Either way it’s a political step, and therefore problematic,” said Anne Marie Schmoltner, a program officer in the chemistry division who retired in February after 30 years in the agency.

In addition to distributing funds to seasoned researchers, the NSF supports students and up-and-coming scientists and engineers through fellowships, research opportunities and grants.

This next generation of talent is being hit particularly hard under Trump, who is attempting to impose sweeping restrictions on visas and travel bans on scores of countries. The proposed 2026 budget includes funding for only 21,400 under- and postgraduate students nationwide—a 75 percent reduction from this year.

Like many scientists across the country, Gill, the paleoecologist, is not accepting new graduate students this fall due to funding uncertainty. “That’s a whole generation of young scientists who see no pathway into the field for them. I cannot stress enough how deeply upsetting and demoralizing these cuts are to a community of people who only ever wanted to solve problems and be of use.”

Yet the NSF student pipeline provides experts for the oil and gas, mining, chemical, big tech and other industries which support Trump, in addition to academic and government-funded agencies.

“Industry is working on optimizing what they’re doing right now, whereas NSF is looking 10, 20 years down the road. The US wants a global, robust economy and for that you need innovation, and for innovation you need the fundamental research funded by the NSF,” said Schmoltner.

The NSF declined to comment, referring instead to the agency website last updated in April which states: ‘The principles of merit, competition, equal opportunity and excellence are the bedrock of the NSF mission. NSF continues to review all projects using Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts criteria.’

The sweeping cuts to the NSF come on top of Trump’s dismantling of other key scientific research departments within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of Agriculture (USDA) and US Geological Service (USGS).

The USGS is the research arm of the Department of Interior. Its scientists help solve real-life problems about hazards, natural resources, water, energy, ecosystems, and the impacts of climate and land-use change for tribal governments, the Bureau of Land Management, fish and wildlife services, and the National Parks Service, among other interior agencies.

Trump’s big, beautiful bill cuts the USGS budget by 39 percent. This includes slashing the entire budget for the agency’s ecosystems mission area (EMA), which leads federal research on species & ecosystems and houses the climate adaptation science centers.

EMA scientists figure out how to better protect at-risk species such as bees and wolverines, minimize harmful overgrazing on BLM lands, and prevent invasive carp from reaching the Great Lakes—all vitally important to protect food security in the US as the climate changes.

The EMA has already lost 25 to 30 percent of employees through DOGE-approved layoffs and buyouts, and is now facing termination. “We’ve already lost a lot of institutional memory and new, up-and-coming leaders. [Under Trump’s budget], all science in support of managing our public lands and natural resources [will] be cut,” said one USGS program officer.

“Our economy is driven by natural resources including timber, minerals, and food systems, and if we don’t manage these in a sustainable way, we will be shooting ourselves in the foot.”

Like at the NSF, the USGC’s gold standard peer-review system for research approval and oversight is now at the mercy of DOGE—in this case Tyler Hasson, the former oil executive given sweeping authority by the Interior secretary. According to USGS staff, Hasson’s office accepts or rejects proposals based on two paragraphs of information program officers are permitted to submit, without any dialogue or feedback. “The gold standard scientific review is being interfered with. This is now a political process,” said one USGS scientist.

A spokesperson for the Interior department said: “The claim that science is being ‘politicized’ is categorically false. We reject the narrative that responsible budget reform constitutes an ‘assault on science’. On the contrary, we are empowering American innovation by cutting red tape, reducing bureaucracy and ensuring that the next generation of scientists and engineers can focus on real-world solutions—not endless paperwork or politically motivated research agendas.”

Geothermal energy harnesses heat from the Earth to produce energy.

The state's investment in the energy source is part of the plan to achieve a net-zero clean energy economy by 2050. The goal is to utilize geothermal energy in conjunction with wind, solar and hydroelectric power. So far, the Colorado Energy Office's Geothermal Energy Grant Program has awarded $10.3 million in funding for 56 initiatives across the state.

The University of Colorado Boulder has received two grants through the program. Associate Vice Chancellor for Facilities Management Brian Lindoerfer said the first project focuses on shallow geothermal energy and the second on deep geothermal energy.

Shallow geothermal, also known as geo-exchange, uses a pump to store heat less than 1,000 feet below the ground that can be drawn out when needed. Think of it as a heat source piggy bank. It still uses electricity, just in a more energy-efficient way.

""You can sort of store heat that you're rejecting during the summertime into the ground, and then you recapture some of that heat in the wintertime through the transfer of some liquids and such that you pump into the ground and then pull it out,"" Lindoerfer said.

The university plans to design shallow geothermal energy networks on campus to decarbonize the school's heating and cooling systems.

For the deep geothermal energy project, the university has partnered with the company Eavor, based in Alberta, Canada, to see if new technology is feasible on campus. Eavor has developed a closed-loop system that goes deep into the Earth, around 10,000 feet, and circulates fluid to generate energy.

""What's really innovative about their technology is that their drilling technique and the closed-loop system that they offer does not involve fracking,"" Lindoerfer said. ""You know, there's less to no seismic risk of their activity. So it's very attractive to us to kind of explore the potential of their application on campus.""

Lindoefer said he expects the design study on shallow geothermal energy to be completed by the fall. The deep geothermal energy project will take a bit longer. Lindoefer anticipates a feasibility report to be done by the end of the year.

Colorado Mesa University on the Western Slope is ahead of the game when it comes to geothermal energy. The university uses geo-exchange technology to provide heating and cooling for 1.2 million square feet of buildings on its campus in Grand Junction. CMU's geo-network is part of the Western Governors Association's Heat Beneath Our Feet initiative, launched by Democratic Gov. Jared Polis to advance geothermal technology in the Mountain West.

Polis has said the state will continue to focus on its clean energy goals, even as the Trump administration rolls back programs to combat climate change. He signed a series of laws this year to cut down greenhouse gas emissions.

“We continue moving forward to improve air quality, reduce pollution, protect Colorado’s future and save people money with low-cost clean energy,"" Polis said in a June news release. ""With these new laws, we are moving in the right direction, and I’m proud of this year’s progress. I appreciate all the legislators who worked on these new laws, and especially Colorado’s state agencies who will be implementing them for Coloradans.""",https://media.9news.com/assets/KUSA/images/1ee29f1e-920b-4e40-bcbb-1d8ee999d000/1ee29f1e-920b-4e40-bcbb-1d8ee999d000_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-07-05 11:03:26.124665

As the world grapples with the challenges of climate change, a growing body of evidence suggests that taking bold action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions can have significant economic benefits. In fact, a report by the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate finds that climate action could deliver at least $26 trillion in economic benefits through 2030.

So, what are the key economic benefits of climate action. For starters, reduction in energy costs is a major advantage. Investing in energy efficiency and renewable energy can help businesses and households save money on their energy bills. Additionally, creating new job opportunities is another significant benefit. The clean energy sector is already supporting millions of jobs worldwide, and this number is expected to grow as the demand for renewable energy increases. Improvement of public health is another important economic benefit of climate action. By reducing air pollution from fossil fuels, we can prevent millions of premature deaths and reduce the economic burden of healthcare costs. In fact, a study by the World Health Organization finds that the economic benefits of reducing air pollution can be as high as $1 trillion per year. Furthermore, stimulating innovation and growth is a critical economic benefit of climate action. Investing in clean energy and green technologies can drive innovation, entrepreneurship, and economic growth. The report by the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate finds that climate action can generate over 65 million new low-carbon jobs in 2030, equivalent to the entire workforce of the UK and Egypt combined. The economic benefits of climate action are clear. By taking bold action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we can unlock significant economic benefits, from reducing energy costs to creating new job opportunities, improving public health, and stimulating innovation and growth. As the world continues to grapple with the challenges of climate change, it’s time to recognize the economic benefits of climate action and work towards a more sustainable and prosperous future.

For the purpose of clarity and emphasis, listed below are five major economic benefits of climate action:

Job Creation and Employment Opportunities: Climate action can create new job opportunities in various sectors, including the following;

Renewable energy: The renewable energy sector is creating new job opportunities in manufacturing, installation, and maintenance.

Energy efficiency: Improving energy efficiency in buildings and industries can create jobs in retrofitting, insulation, and other related services.

Sustainable infrastructure: Investing in sustainable infrastructure, such as green buildings, can create jobs in construction, architecture, and engineering.

Climate resilience and adaptation: Climate resilience and adaptation measures, such as sea walls, levees, and green roofs, can create jobs in construction, engineering, and environmental management.

According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the renewable energy sector employed 11 million people worldwide in 2020, and this number is expected to triple by 2050.

Increased Economic Productivity: Climate action can increase economic productivity by:

Improving energy efficiency: Energy-efficient technologies and practices can reduce energy consumption, lower energy bills, and increase productivity.

Enhancing resource efficiency: Climate action can promote the efficient use of resources, such as water and raw materials, which can lead to cost savings and increased productivity.

Reducing climate-related disruptions: Climate action can reduce the risk of climate-related disruptions, such as heatwaves, droughts, and floods, which can impact economic productivity.

Promoting sustainable agriculture: Climate action can promote sustainable agriculture practices, which can increase crop yields, improve food security, and enhance economic productivity.

According to a study by the International Energy Agency (IEA), energy efficiency measures can increase economic productivity by up to 2% annually.

Reduced Healthcare Costs: Climate action can reduce healthcare costs by:

Improving air quality: Reducing greenhouse gas emissions can improve air quality, which can reduce the incidence of respiratory diseases and other health problems.

Reducing heat-related illnesses: Climate action can reduce the risk of heat-related illnesses, such as heat exhaustion and heat stroke.

Reducing water-borne diseases: Climate action can reduce the risk of water-borne diseases, such as cholera and typhoid fever.

Promoting physical activity: Climate action can promote physical activity, such as walking and cycling, which can reduce the risk of chronic diseases.

According to a study by the World Health Organization (WHO), the economic benefits of reducing air pollution can be up to 10 times higher than the costs of implementing pollution control measures.

Reducing climate-related uncertainty: Climate action can reduce climate-related uncertainty by promoting the use of climate models and scenario planning.

Supporting climate risk management: Climate action can support climate risk management by promoting the use of climate risk assessments and climate risk management frameworks.

According to a study by the Economist Intelligence Unit, climate change can reduce global economic output by up to 11% by 2100 if left unchecked.",https://cdn.thenationonlineng.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/04072041/Adeleye-Adebayo.png,N,,2025-07-05 13:23:36.997820

Fossil fuels—petroleum, natural gas, and coal—accounted for 82% of total U.S. energy consumption in 2024. Nonfossil fuel energy—from renewables and nuclear energy—accounted for the other 18%. Petroleum remained the most-consumed fuel in the United States, as it has been for the past 75 years, and nuclear energy consumption exceeded coal consumption for the first time ever.

When the Declaration of Independence was signed in 1776, wood, a renewable energy source, was the largest source of energy in the United States. Used for heating, cooking, and lighting, wood remained the largest U.S. energy source until the late 1800s, when coal consumption became more common. Wood energy is still consumed, mainly by industrial lumber and paper plants that burn excess wood waste to generate electricity.

Coal was the largest source of U.S. energy for about 65 years, from 1885 until 1950. Early uses of coal included many purposes that are no longer common, such as in stoves for home heating and in engines for trains and ships. Since the 1960s, nearly all coal consumed in the United States has been for electricity generation.

Petroleum has been the most-consumed source of energy in the United States since 1950. Petroleum products such as motor gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and propane are commonly used across all sectors of the U.S. economy, from transportation to industrial chemicals and plastics.

Natural gas is the second-largest source of U.S. energy consumption, as it has been most years since it surpassed coal in 1958. Natural gas was once considered a waste byproduct of crude oil production but now has become a common energy source for heating and electricity generation.

Early use of water to power grist, lumber, and other milling operations is not well quantified and not included in our data, but such mills were common throughout early U.S. history. The first industrial use of hydropower to generate electricity in the United States was to power lamps at a chair factory in Grand Rapids, Michigan, in 1880. The world’s first hydroelectric power plant to sell electricity to the public opened on the Fox River near Appleton, Wisconsin, in 1882.

Other forms of renewable energy did not become significant contributors to U.S. energy production until more recently. In 2016, biofuels—including the fuel ethanol mixed in motor gasoline—became the most-consumed U.S. renewable energy source.

Electricity generation from some zero-carbon sources, such as wind and solar, has increased rapidly in recent years, while generation from others, such as hydropower and nuclear, has remained relatively flat. In 2022, U.S. energy consumption from renewable sources surpassed nuclear energy for the first time since 1984, and in 2023, renewables surpassed coal for the first time since around the early 1880s. The United States now consumes more energy from wind and solar sources individually than from hydropower.

To compare different forms of energy, we convert to common units of heat, called British thermal units. Appendix A of our Monthly Energy Review has the conversion factors that we use for each energy source, and Appendix E explains how we convert noncombustible renewable energy sources.

In fact, the map estimates that the facility, sold to INEOS last year, contributes to cancer risk in communities 30 miles away.

Late in the Biden administration, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced that it would clamp down on 218 of the nation’s worst chemical polluters, which put close to 10 million people at elevated risk of developing cancer. The EPA’s aim was to reduce that number by more than 1.2 million and improve air quality for high-risk communities by increasing monitoring and strengthening pollution controls at some of the country’s largest chemical plants.

But the regulation that would have set this effort in motion is in jeopardy. In March, the Trump EPA said it would re-evaluate the so-called HON rule—along with other National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs)—saying the rules placed “unnecessary burdens” on industry. The agency offered companies step-by-step instructions for seeking two-year exemptions from the president, and two industry groups requested blanket exemptions for the 218 chemical plants subject to the HON rule, which covers hazardous organic pollutants.

The White House won’t say whether Trump has granted any such exemptions. But a Public Health Watch analysis has found that any disruption of the HON rule could have severe consequences, protecting polluters that frequently break the law and worsening health risks for already-overburdened communities.

We analyzed data from the Census Bureau, the EPA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and found:

About 1.4 million people—including 355,000 children and 61,000 veterans—live within two miles of chemical plants subject to the HON rule. This population—urban, suburban and rural—is disproportionately Black and Hispanic or Latino and has a poverty rate almost double the national rate.

When compared to the estimated national rates, residents of metropolitan areas who live near HON plants are more likely to identify as having “fair” or “poor” health status and a disability, according to the CDC. They are also more likely to lack stable housing and reliable transportation, and feel socially isolated.

HON facilities contribute the majority of emissions nationwide for five carcinogens—1,3 butadiene, ethylene oxide, ethylene dichloride, vinyl chloride and chloroprene—and 49 other hazardous air pollutants. They are also more likely to commit serious Clean Air Act violations, be subject to enforcement actions and remain out of compliance for months or years at a time.

Twenty-six percent of adults living near HON facilities in urban and suburban areas struggle to obtain adequate food, compared with 14 percent nationally. When compared to the estimated national rate, they are almost twice as likely to be threatened with utility shut-offs for overdue bills.

Tracey Woodruff, a former EPA scientist and policy advisor now on the faculty at the University of California San Francisco, has spent decades studying the impact of chemicals on health and childhood development. She said the Public Health Watch analysis is consistent with research showing that industrial facilities are frequently placed in communities that have fewer resources and are more impacted by other stressors like food and housing insecurity. These factors make residents of such communities even more susceptible to the effects of pollution, Woodruff said.

Delaying or dismantling the HON rule, she said, would only exacerbate the health outcomes highlighted in the analysis, such as diabetes, high blood pressure and depression. HON plants discharge chemicals known to not only cause cancer but also affect the reproductive, cardiovascular, respiratory and neurological systems.

“Rolling back the HON Rule is only going to make people sicker,” Woodruff said.

She noted that Trump’s Make America Healthy Again commission correctly noted that children are most impacted by exposures to toxic chemicals, even as his administration moves to dismantle rules meant to protect them.

“It just shows who they care more about, which is the polluting facilities and their donors and not the people who actually are going to suffer from this,” Woodruff said.

The EPA did not respond to questions about Public Health Watch’s analysis. Instead, a spokesperson said in an email that the agency was “not surprised to see yet another ‘media outlet’ ignore the fact that we can protect the environment and grow the economy at the same time.”

“This Place Represents Violence”

Traci Donatto grew up in Deer Park, Texas, a city along the Houston Ship Channel surrounded by more than 20 HON plants. She remembers sitting in the backseat of her parents’ car as a child, driving over the bridge that crosses the channel and staring out at a sea of lights and flares that sprawled for miles.

“My dad would be like, ‘Isn’t that gorgeous, girls? That’s money. As long as those lights are on, we can eat,’” said Donatto, whose father and great grandfather worked in the oil and petrochemical industries. “At the earliest age that was our perspective of thinking of these refineries as a source of safety and security.”

Now—whenever she finds herself wheezing or turning off her air conditioner to avoid sucking in the rancid outside air—Donatto sees things differently. To her, the pollution is an assault on her body and that of her 10-year-old son, Russell. After being away for 20 years, she moved back to Deer Park in 2023 to care for her father, who is dying of prostate cancer and a rare form of throat cancer. He spent five decades working as a contract welder for more than a dozen chemical plants and refineries.

“For me this place represents violence. Deep, deep, violation,” Donatto said.

Deer Park is one of many Southern cities that are overburdened with petrochemical pollution and were supposed to benefit from the HON rule. EPA data show that 131 HON facilities—60 percent of the total—are located in Texas and Louisiana. Roughly three million people in those states live within about six miles of plants subject to the rule; one-third are Hispanic or Latino and a quarter are Black.

But industry and state regulators have resisted the EPA’s attempts to make the air in these places cleaner. For example, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, or TCEQ, and the chemical industry have tried to discredit the science behind one of the main carcinogens targeted in the rule—ethylene oxide.

Ethylene oxide is used to sterilize medical equipment and produce other chemical products like antifreeze. Releases of the chemical from HON plants are a major driver of cancer risk from air toxics for some 7 million people, according to the EPA. Ethylene oxide is known to cause blood and breast cancers. Because the chemical mutates DNA, children exposed to it early in life are especially at risk. A 2023 EPA analysis found that workers using the gas to sterilize medical equipment faced as high as a 1-in-10 cancer risk; the agency’s target is no greater than 1-in-10,000.

The updated rule seeks to cut HON facilities’ ethylene oxide emissions by 80 percent.

But Texas has argued for years that ethylene oxide has not been “conclusively demonstrated” to cause cancer in humans, disregarding decades of research that says otherwise. In 2020, the TCEQ, the American Chemistry Council—an industry lobby group—and Huntsman Petrochemicals, which was one of the largest emitters of ethylene oxide in the country, petitioned the EPA to significantly reduce the risk value it assigned to the gas. Texas had commissioned its own study that concluded the value should be thousands of times lower than the one established by the EPA. The agency reviewed and ultimately re-affirmed its assessment.

Although Huntsman had sold its ethylene oxide business to Indorama Ventures at the beginning of 2020, the company continued to challenge the EPA’s position. It appealed the agency’s assessment to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2023, but the court sided with the EPA—upholding the rule and denying any further review.

Huntsman did not respond to requests for comment.

Keeve Nachman, a researcher and professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, served on a National Academy of Sciences committee that weighed in on the debate last year. The committee found several holes in the TCEQ’s research—the exclusion of some key human breast cancer studies, for instance.

Nachmann told Public Health Watch that the evidence of ethylene oxide’s carcinogenicity has only gotten stronger since the EPA assigned its risk value in 2016. A follow-up study of workers exposed to the chemical, for example, found a breast cancer mortality rate three times higher than a non-exposed group. Delaying implementation of the HON rule “doesn’t make any sense,” Nachman said.

“Given [ethylene oxide’s] carcinogenic potential, this delay means fenceline communities will continue to be at a significantly increased risk of cancers,” he said.

A TCEQ spokesperson wrote in a statement to Public Health Watch that the agency’s “work to derive risk values is not outcome oriented. Rather, the work is to evaluate current science to determine the most appropriate risk values.”

The TCEQ said that it stood by its work and that there were “multiple errors and inconsistencies” in the National Academy of Sciences report.

The Sprawling Reach of Ethylene Oxide

While those living closest to the facilities face the highest health risks, experts say, winds can carry pollution miles from the plants’ fence lines. Over a lifetime, even smaller amounts of ethylene oxide can increase the odds of developing cancer for residents of these more distant areas.

A tool created by the Environmental Defense Fund illustrates the reach of petrochemical pollution. It uses EPA datasets from 2020, the most recent year available, to calculate cancer risk from specific facilities’ emissions.

According to the map, over half of Traci Donatto’s cancer risk from petrochemical pollution comes from the ethylene oxide emissions of a former LyondellBasell plant in Pasadena, about seven miles from her home. In fact, the map estimates that the facility, sold to INEOS last year, contributes to cancer risk in communities 30 miles away. According to the most recent Toxics Release Inventory, the plant was the fifth-largest emitter of ethylene oxide in the nation in 2023.

Neighborhoods closest to the INEOS plant are in the 99th percentile in the country for cancer risk from air pollution, according to the map. It estimates that the facility’s ethylene oxide emissions account for between 50 and 80 percent of the community’s cancer risk from petrochemical pollution.

A Pattern of Law Breaking

The INEOS plant exemplifies a common pattern among HON facilities—frequent violations of state and federal air quality laws.

Last year, Texas fined a LyondellBasell subsidiary, Equistar Chemicals, LP, $1.4 million for dozens of violations, including chemical releases, that took place at the Bayport facility in Pasadena between 2017 and 2022. One 163-day leak spewed thousands of pounds of the ethylene oxide into the air.

The facility also has two pending penalties. According to public records, the TCEQ proposed a $25,000 fine against Equistar in March for a three-month-long release of 27,000 pounds of volatile organic compounds, a class of chemicals that includes many carcinogens. The TCEQ declined to provide details on a second alleged violation by Equistar.

LyondellBassell did not respond to requests for comment.

An INEOS spokesperson said in a written statement to Public Health Watch that the company bought the facility before the violations occurred. The company is “focused on integrating the site into its current operations, which includes a clear priority on safety, health, and environmental performance,” the statement said. The spokesperson declined to comment on the status of the facility’s compliance with the HON rule and whether it has received an exemption.

The EPA considers most HON facilities to be “major” sources of air pollution, a classification that means a facility releases tens of thousands of pounds of one or more hazardous air pollutants. Public Health Watch analyzed the enforcement and compliance history of the more than 18,000 major sources in the country and found that HON facilities are more likely to be habitual lawbreakers. Twenty-three percent of HON plants remained out of compliance with their air permits for eight or more of the past 12 quarters, compared to just four percent of other major sources.

HON plants are also seven times more likely than other facilities to have been hit with multiple state or federal enforcement actions for air violations in the past five years, which often come with large penalties. More than half of HON facilities were fined for breaking air-quality laws during that period; the group collectively received more than $110 million in penalties.

Cynthia Palmer, a petrochemical analyst for the environmental advocacy group Moms Clean Air Force, said it would be immoral for the EPA to grant exemptions to facilities that are already flouting the law.

“If a criminal is on a killing spree, our society doesn’t just shrug it off and say, ‘Let them be. Thugs will be thugs,’” Palmer said. “Just because these chemical manufacturers are already violators and are middle-fingering law enforcement and the communities they’re located in does not mean we should let them do what they want and exempt them from pollution controls.”

Palmer and other advocates were hopeful the HON rule would hold chronic violators accountable. The rule comes with an added layer of transparency: a requirement that companies regularly collect air-quality data at the edges of their facilities, a practice known as fenceline monitoring.

This would give communities more precise data than the EPA’s databases, where companies self-report annual pollution emissions. Studies have shown that actual pollution levels are often higher than what companies report.

One study captured emissions in Louisiana’s Cancer Alley, an 85-mile stretch of the Mississippi River between Baton Rouge and New Orleans with more than a hundred petrochemical facilities and oil refineries. In 2023, scientists monitored pollution levels outside the property lines of six ethylene oxide-emitting facilities for eight hours a day over 23 days. They consistently found ethylene oxide levels 10 times higher than the EPA’s estimates, which are calculated from companies’ reported annual emissions.

Peter DeCarlo of Johns Hopkins, an author of the Louisiana study, said this suggests that plants are emitting much more than they are telling the government, a widespread problem in regulating petrochemical facilities. The EPA’s “maximum” acceptable cancer risk from exposure to all toxic air pollutants is 1 in 10,000. Along some fencelines, DeCarlo and his team detected ethylene oxide levels that would result in a cancer risk 3,000 times greater than that maximum. They concluded that some plants could have “undetected leaks, underperforming pollution control equipment [or] intentional or scheduled releases,” DeCarlo wrote in an email to Public Health Watch.

DeCarlo said the fenceline monitoring requirement in the HON rule may help facilities identify leaks before they get out of control—and save money at the same time. He’s concerned about the prospect of blanket exemptions.

DeCarlo said that removing pollution limits and monitoring requirements from companies that are already underestimating their emissions means pollution levels will continue to be much worse than expected.

“We’re going to be stuck in this problem where the cancer risk from breathing these chemicals is much higher than it should be for an extended period of time,” he said.

The White House declined to answer questions from Public Health Watch about the status of HON exemptions or the potential for increasing health risks if the rule is delayed or weakened. Instead, Assistant Press Secretary Taylor Rogers responded with a written statement: “No matter what the so-called radical climate ‘experts’ say, the facts remain: US air quality is among the best of industrialized countries and our framework for environmental protection remains the gold standard across the world. President Trump’s commonsense policies are lowering energy costs for American families and businesses while removing toxic chemicals from our environment.”

While it’s unclear whether Trump has granted any HON rule exemptions, the administration and the chemical industry appear to be well-aligned in their opposition to new regulation. When Trump’s EPA announced it would re-evaluate hazardous air pollutant standards, it questioned its own authority to make the rules as well as the science behind them. The agency also said that compliance would be too costly and “create unnecessary burdens” for manufacturers that are “a vital part of the economy.”

A spokesperson from the American Chemistry Council, one of the groups that submitted the blanket exemption request, wrote in a statement to Public Health Watch that the HON rule “exceeds the EPA’s statutory authority, disregards relevant scientific evidence, and overlooks significant practical concerns.”

A Painful Dilemma

When Traci Donatto learned about the hundreds of petrochemical facilities trying to avoid reducing their cancer-causing emissions, she felt unbridled rage.

Not only does she believe that industry pollution is responsible for her father’s cancer, she also sees it taking a toll on her child.

The perceived American retreat from solar, wind, and EVs will further strengthen Chinese dominance in these sectors.","Experts warn the legislation could drive up household energy bills over the next decade, slow the deployment of clean technologies on the US power grid, and – most importantly – cement China’s dominance in the global clean energy race.

US domestic energy bills to increase

The provisions of the OBBBA legislation signed by Trump are likely to push household energy bills by 2-7 per cent – an increase of $95-250 – in 2035, according to the New York-headquartered Rhodium Group. “Most of this increase is driven by fewer electric vehicles on the road, leading to higher motor gasoline consumption and prices,” the think tank said in a note on July 2.

Prior to the OBBBA, provisions under the IRA provided tax credits for purchase of new commercial and passenger EVs through 2032. Now, the benefits will end on September 30 later this year. To be eligible for clean electricity tax credits, wind and solar projects will now have to come online by the end of 2027. While the Senate also considered a new excise tax on upcoming wind and solar facilities with inadequate domestic content, the provision was removed from the final draft.

“Given that we expect far fewer EVs on the road and a meaningful reduction in clean energy deployment on the grid, there are also still considerable questions around the viability of new clean energy manufacturing in the US… lower levels of domestic demand for batteries, solar panels, wind turbines, and electric vehicles could threaten the economic case for a number of manufacturing facilities that have been announced or, in some cases, that are already operating,” Rhodium said.

US doubles down on fossil fuels

As expected, the oil and gas industry – long a key backer of Trump’s presidential campaigns – welcomed the OBBBA’s push to expand fossil fuel production. But critics argue that US shale remains costlier than renewables, and that leaning on fossil fuels to meet rising electricity demand is both economically and practically unviable.

In a statement on the legislation, David Widawsky, director of the World Resources Institute (WRI), US, said, “Fossil fuels alone won’t meet the skyrocketing energy demand from manufacturing, AI, electrification, and increasingly frequent and intense heat waves that prompt more AC usage. But America can create a more flexible, agile, and resilient power system with renewables and grid upgrades. Clean energy sources are better positioned to come online quickly to meet growing electricity needs and spur economic growth.”

The final OBBBA text, while broadly scaling back clean energy support, is still less severe than the House version originally sent to the Senate. It gives clean hydrogen projects until end-2027 to qualify for tax credits – two years more than earlier proposed – and retains incentives for carbon capture, nuclear power, and clean fuels. Energy storage systems tied to solar or wind can also access full investment benefits through 2032, avoiding a sharper phaseout of benefits.

China races ahead on solar, wind, EVs

Across the Pacific, China has ramped up thermal power to meet rising industrial demand – but a steady pivot to clean technologies remains central to its energy strategy. For instance, in 2024, while it started construction to add around 100 GW of coal power capacity, it added a whopping 420 GW of solar and wind. In comparison, the US added less than 55 GW in 2024, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).

Moreover, Rhodium estimates that China’s push to electrify its vehicle fleet, particularly in trucking, is already displacing around 1 million barrels of oil per day – roughly equivalent to Oman’s daily output. The perceived American retreat from solar, wind, and EVs will further strengthen Chinese dominance in these sectors.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/07/trump_2cf26d.jpg,N,,2025-07-05 09:07:16.666872

At nearly 900 pages, the legislation is a sprawling collection of tax breaks, spending cuts and other Republican priorities, including new money for national defense and deportations.

Democrats united against the legislation, but were powerless to stop it as long as Republicans stayed united. The Senate passed the bill Tuesday, with Vice President JD Vance casting the tiebreaking vote. The House passed an earlier iteration of the bill in May with just one vote to spare. It passed the final version Thursday 218-214.

Here’s the latest on what’s in the bill and when some of its provisions go into effect.

GOP bill includes reductions for businesses and new tax breaks

Republicans say the bill is crucial because there would be a massive tax increase after December when tax breaks from Trump’s first term expire. The legislation contains about $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.

The existing tax rates and brackets would become permanent under the bill, solidifying the tax cuts approved in Trump’s first term.

It temporarily would add new tax deductions on tip, overtime and auto loans. There’s also a $6,000 deduction for older adults who earn no more than $75,000 a year, a nod to his pledge to end taxes on Social Security benefits.

It would boost the $2,000 child tax credit to $2,200. Millions of families at lower income levels would not get the full credit.

A cap on state and local deductions, called SALT, would quadruple to $40,000 for five years. It’s a provision important to New York and other high tax states, though the House wanted it to last for 10 years.

There are scores of business-related tax cuts, including allowing businesses to immediately write off 100% of the cost of equipment and research. Proponents say this will boost economic growth.

The wealthiest households would see a $12,000 increase from the legislation, and the bill would cost the poorest people $1,600 a year, mainly due to reductions in Medicaid and food aid, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office analysis of the House’s version.

GOP bill funds the border wall, deportations and a missile shield

The bill would provide some $350 billion for Trump’s border and national security agenda, including for the U.S.-Mexico border wall and for 100,000 migrant detention facility beds, as he aims to fulfill his promise of the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history.

Money would go for hiring 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, with $10,000 signing bonuses and a surge of Border Patrol officers, as well. The goal is to deport some 1 million people per year.

To help pay for it, immigrants would face various new fees, including when seeking asylum protections.

For the Pentagon, the bill would provide billions for ship building, munitions systems, and quality of life measures for servicemen and women, as well as $25 billion for the development of the Golden Dome missile defense system. The Defense Department would have $1 billion for border security.

Medicaid, SNAP face deep cuts to fund bill’s tax breaks and spending

To help partly offset the lost tax revenue and new spending, Republicans aim to cut back on Medicaid and food assistance for people below the poverty line.

Republicans argue they are trying to rightsize the safety net programs for the population they were initially designed to serve, mainly pregnant women, the disabled and children, and root out what they describe as waste, fraud and abuse.

The package includes new 80-hour-a-month work requirements for many adults receiving Medicaid and food stamps, including older people up to age 65. Parents of children 14 and older would have to meet the program’s work requirements.

There’s also a proposed new $35 co-payment that can be charged to patients using Medicaid services.

More than 71 million people rely on Medicaid, which expanded under Obama’s Affordable Care Act, and 40 million use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Most already work, according to analysts.

The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 11.8 million more Americans would become uninsured by 2034 if the bill became law and 3 million more would not qualify for food stamps, also known as SNAP benefits.

Republicans are looking to have states pick up some of the cost for SNAP benefits. Currently, the federal government funds all benefit costs. Under the bill, states beginning in 2028 will be required to contribute a set percentage of those costs if their payment error rate exceeds 6%. Payment errors include both underpayments and overpayments.

But the Senate bill temporarily delays the start date of that cost-sharing for states with the highest SNAP error rates. Alaska has the highest error rate in the nation at nearly 25%, according to Department of Agriculture data. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, had fought for the exception. She was a decisive vote in getting the bill through the Senate.

The ‘big beautiful’ bill slashes clean energy tax credits

Republicans are proposing to dramatically roll back tax breaks designed to boost clean energy projects fueled by renewable sources such as energy and wind. The tax breaks were a central component of President Joe Biden’s 2022 landmark bill focused on addressing climate change and lowering health care costs.

Democratic Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden went so far as to call the GOP provisions a “death sentence for America’s wind and solar industries and an inevitable hike in utility bills.”

A tax break for people who buy new or used electric vehicles would expire on Sept. 30 of this year, instead of at the end of 2032 under current law.

Meanwhile, a tax credit for the production of critical materials will be expanded to include metallurgical coal used in steelmaking.

The bill creates ‘Trump Accounts’ — and funds a national hero garden

A number of extra provisions reflect other GOP priorities.

The bill creates a new children’s savings program, called Trump Accounts, with a potential $1,000 deposit from the Treasury.

The Senate provided $40 million to establish Trump’s long-sought “National Garden of American Heroes.”

There’s a new excise tax on university endowments and a new tax on remittances, or transfers of money that people in the U.S. send abroad. The tax is equal to 1% of the transfer.

A $200 tax on gun silencers and short-barreled rifles and shotguns was eliminated.

One provision bars for one year Medicaid payments to family planning providers that provide abortions, namely Planned Parenthood.

Another section expands the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, a hard-fought provision from GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, for those impacted by nuclear development and testing.

Billions would go for the Artemis moon mission and for the exploration of Mars, while $88 million is earmarked for a pandemic response accountability committee.

Additionally, a provision would increase the nation’s debt limit, by $5 trillion, to allow continued borrowing to pay already accrued bills.

State AI regulations cut from bill after a GOP uproar

The Senate overwhelmingly revolted against a proposal meant to deter states from regulating artificial intelligence. Republican governors across the country asked for the moratorium to be removed and the Senate voted to do so with a resounding 99-1 vote.

A provision was thrown in at the final hours that will provide $10 billion annually to rural hospitals for five years, or $50 billion in total. The Senate bill had originally provided $25 billion for the program, but that number was upped to win over holdout GOP senators and a coalition of House Republicans warning that reduced Medicaid provider taxes would hurt rural hospitals.

The amended bill also stripped out a new tax on wind and solar projects that use a certain percentage of components from China.

Final price tag: GOP bill could add $3.3 trillion to deficit

Altogether, the Congressional Budget Office projects that the bill would increase federal deficits over the next 10 years by nearly $3.3 trillion from 2025 to 2034.

Or not, depending on how one does the math.

Senate Republicans are proposing a unique strategy of not counting the existing tax breaks as a new cost because those breaks are already “current policy.” Republican senators say the Senate Budget Committee chairman has the authority to set the baseline for the preferred approach.

Under the alternative Senate GOP view, the bill would reduce deficits by almost half a trillion dollars over the coming decade, the CBO said.

Democrats say this is “magic math” that obscures the true costs of the tax breaks. Some nonpartisan groups worried about the country’s fiscal trajectory are siding with Democrats in that regard. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says Senate Republicans were employing an “accounting gimmick that would make Enron executives blush.”

“They're ready to go, we just need good projects to come,” added Friedman.
Türkiye is building its first nuclear power plant, the four-unit Akkuyu project on the Mediterranean coast in partnership with Russia’s state nuclear agency, Rosatom.
""It's only natural that US companies would want to seek that expertise and take advantage of it as they explore projects here in Türkiye,” he added.
He added that Washington sees nuclear cooperation as a pillar of its broader strategic relationship with Ankara.","The US financing agencies are ready to bankroll nuclear energy projects in Türkiye, particularly small modular reactors (SMRs), but are waiting for viable proposals, a senior US State Department advisor said.

“We're waiting for the projects to come forward so we can say, match the project with the money,” Justin Friedman told Anadolu on the sidelines of the 11th Nuclear Power Plants Summit in Istanbul, held July 1-2.

“They're ready to go, we just need good projects to come,” added Friedman.

The senior advisor said that the US EXIM Bank and the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) have already issued letters of interest worth more than $17 billion for reactors in Romania and Poland and are now looking at Türkiye.

“I know that they are exploring opportunities here in Türkiye, and have programs to help particularly SMRs to move forward,” he added.

Türkiye is building its first nuclear power plant, the four-unit Akkuyu project on the Mediterranean coast in partnership with Russia’s state nuclear agency, Rosatom. The reactors are slated to enter service one year apart and, once fully online, are expected to meet about 10 percent of the nation’s electricity demand for at least 60 years.

Ankara also plans large-scale plants in Sinop on the Black Sea and in the northwestern Thrace region, aiming for a total of 20 gigawatts of installed nuclear capacity by 2050. In parallel, officials are evaluating SMRs as part of the country’s long-term energy mix.

Commenting on the potential cooperation between the two sides in the field of SMRs, Friedman, who served as political counselor at the US Embassy in Ankara between 2014 and 2017, said, “We should expect a natural, organic cooperation between US and Turkish companies.”

“Turkish companies already, today, are providing parts and supplies, and services for nuclear projects outside of Türkiye,"" he said.

""It's only natural that US companies would want to seek that expertise and take advantage of it as they explore projects here in Türkiye,” he added.

- By working together on nuclear energy, the two countries may grow partnership, Friedman says

Friedman called the current moment “an exciting time” for the global nuclear sector, noting that US President Donald Trump has set a goal of adding 400 gigawatts of nuclear capacity in the US by 2050. “That’s a very ambitious goal, and that’s why the US is in the lead around the world,” he said.

He added that Washington sees nuclear cooperation as a pillar of its broader strategic relationship with Ankara. “Nuclear is a piece of that. And, we're hoping that by working together on the nuclear energy issue, we can extend and grow our partnership.”

The senior advisor said the US and Türkiye are “deep friends and good partners” and expressed hope that their cooperation would continue to grow in the nuclear energy field. “We see indications on both sides that we want to move forward, and I’m just happy to be here to be part of that,” he said.

When asked whether a bilateral nuclear agreement could be expected soon, Friedman said, “I hope for a deal soon. I hope to be part of the team that develops that deal. But there’s nothing I can talk about right now.”

Sonja Hutson

If you were gonna put some money on which companies stood to gain the most from a Trump presidency, you probably would have done things a little differently every month he’s been in office so far. In January you might have bet on oil.

Donald Trump voice clip

Today, I will also declare a national energy emergency. We will drill, baby, drill.

Sonja Hutson

In March, maybe something crypto related.

News clip

The latest from Truth Social from the president saying a US crypto reserve will elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden administration . . .

Sonja Hutson

And in April, you might have sold shares in just about any of those companies.

Donald Trump voice clip

This is ‘liberation day’, waiting for a long time. April 2nd, 2025 will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America’s destiny . . .

Sonja Hutson

But as it turns out, there actually are some pretty clear answers about which industries have stood to gain over the last six months. The FT pored over data on the largest global corporations to figure out who’s winning and who’s losing in President Trump’s economy.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

This is Swamp Notes, the weekly podcast from the Financial Times, where we talk about all of the things happening in US politics, finance and the economy. I’m Sonja Hutson, and this week we’re asking: who are the corporate winners and losers of Trump’s presidency? Here with me to discuss is Derek Brower. He’s the FT’s US news editor. Hi, Derek.

Derek Brower

Hi, Sonja.

Sonja Hutson

And we’ve also got Greg Meyer, the FT’s US consumer editor. Hi, Greg.

Gregory Meyer

Hello.

Sonja Hutson

So Derek, why did you decide to start this project, and what were you expecting to find?

Derek Brower

Well, there’s been so much volatility in global markets since Trump entered office, and we wanted to show it and find out which companies have done best, which have done worst. I think we were expecting to find that maybe the fossil fuel producers that Trump touted during his election campaign, or the crypto companies, or the arms companies, the weapons manufacturers, would all do best. And, in some cases, we found evidence of that, although not in all cases. And there were some surprises in there.

Sonja Hutson

Yeah, so tell me about some of the surprises. What’d you find in terms of the winners?

Derek Brower

Yeah, I guess the top line is that European defence companies doing well, some Chinese companies doing reasonably well. So this whole idea that we, I think, started with was Donald Trump would be great for the American economy, or that was what he purported to be doing, and that this would reflect itself in the performance of American companies didn’t actually turn out to be that accurate.

Sonja Hutson

That’s interesting. Now, I do wanna dive into some of the specifics here, but before we do that, Greg, how did you measure success here? What constitutes a winner?

Gregory Meyer

That’s a really important question. For this particular project that we’re discussing, being a winner or loser was measured solely by their stock market performance, by their percentage change in their stock price or relatedly the rise and fall of their market capitalisation since Trump’s inauguration in late January.

Sonja Hutson

So Derek, you mentioned earlier that European defence companies were one of the big winners that you found in this analysis. What’s an example of a company that has directly benefited from Trump’s presidency?

Derek Brower

Rheinmetall, that’s Germany’s largest weapons manufacturer. It’s one of the companies. Saab is another one, that’s another big weapons manufacturer. I mean, these are companies that have been kind of sleeper companies in Europe for a long time, plugging away and making European weapons. And, all of a sudden, across Europe, there’s all this anxiety that the US is no longer gonna be the shield for European countries in the face of Russia. They’re not going to be providing the weapons for Ukraine. US may be less committed to Nato than in the past, and Europeans have responded, European politicians, in particular Germany, have responded by saying, OK, we’re gonna build this stuff at home. And that’s been very good for domestic, European domestic weapons manufacturers.

Sonja Hutson

Greg, are there any other examples of winners that stood out to you?

Gregory Meyer

I mean, the cryptocurrency sector has clearly been a winner. I mean, under the Biden administration, SEC chair Gary Gensler in particular was taking a very, very tough line on crypto, and he . . .

Sonja Hutson

Yeah, he kind of became public enemy number one to a lot of these crypto companies.

Gregory Meyer

Yeah, and had to file lawsuits against several of the operators, including Coinbase, which is a big-listed crypto trading platform. Coinbase since has . . . their shares have done very well this year, reflecting the Trump administration’s warm embrace of crypto. I mean, so warm, in fact, that Donald Trump and Melania Trump have launched memecoins in their own name. Two names that caught my eye on the list of winners were Capital One, which is the credit card lender and auto lender. They had actually been sued by the Trump Organization for terminating hundreds of bank accounts after the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol by Trump supporters. But, in fact, the Trump administration has been good for the lender and approved Capital One’s takeover of the credit card company Discover Financial, which is the first major bank merger in more than five years. And, also interesting to me — the core of my beat is the retail sector — is Dollar General, which is the largest dollar store chain. Dollar General’s business has strengthened in the past quarter, probably through their own internal turnaround efforts. But, interestingly, they also noted that more affluent customers have been trading down and shopping at Dollar General to escape inflation.

Sonja Hutson

So that’s one of those cases where the fact the Dollar General is doing well is actually not a good sign for the economy.

Gregory Meyer

Yeah. I mean, Dollar General does well. It’s not necessarily a sign that households are doing well because they’re a discount operator.

Sonja Hutson

So, you know, we just went through some of the biggest winners of the Trump presidency so far. And so I think it’s time we should transition to the losers. Derek, who are they?

Derek Brower

Well, in the US, it’s companies that are exposed to the tariffs, you know, in market cap terms, that’s hundreds of billions of dollars lost for companies like Apple, you the big names. Apple makes most of its phones and most of its phones in China. Trump launched a trade war against China. That thing’s pretty obvious and, and easy to understand. But there’s other companies as pharma companies that have been hit as well. And then you go down through this and then you see the obvious ones like energy. Well, prices are down. It’s not strictly related to Trump, but it is a bit because his policies are all designed to bring the price of fossil fuels down. So if you produce fossil fuels, that makes you less profitable.

Sonja Hutson

Yeah, Derek, tell me a little bit more about the energy sector and who’s suffering there. Is it across the board? Is it both oil companies and green energy developers?

Derek Brower

It kind of is, and this is what’s fascinating is that under Biden, fossil fuel industry was very angry about his policies and the restrictions that they perceived on drilling and controls on pollution and so on, and they all — or not all of them — but many of them helped bankroll Trump’s campaign last year because Trump was promising, in his words, to unleash American energy and drill, baby, drill. And allow all this to happen. And to scrap subsidies for clean energy that oil bosses thought might be affecting them. And now that Trump’s in, whose policies are definitely very, very lenient towards oil and gas producers — and very punitive to clean energy producers — everybody’s doing pretty badly.

Some of the big shale producers, shale oil and gas producers that were doing well under Biden, are now among the weaker performers on the S&P 500 and in our list, like Occidental Petroleum. Some of the solar panel installers and manufacturers who were hoping to do a lot better, thanks to Joe Biden’s subsidies through the Inflation Reduction Act, now they’re being hammered because Trump is rolling back the tax credits and subsidies that were in the Inflation Reduction Act. And he’s doing that through his big, beautiful bill, which — it’s deliberate unwinding of all this clean energy legislation that Biden successfully enacted.

Sonja Hutson

Yeah, it’s interesting. You would kind of expect a president to favour one and not the other and you would have them have opposite fates. It’s interesting that they’re both kind of suffering. Greg, back to you, what’s the company that stood out to you that’s felt the brunt of Trump’s policies and has been suffering?

Gregory Meyer

One of them, and the one that tops our list of losers by their share decline is Deckers Outdoor. Probably not a name that most consumers will know, but they will know the shoes they make, which are UGG’s boots and Hoka running shoes.

Sonja Hutson

Definitely know those.

Gregory Meyer

Yes, much of the global shoe supply chain is based in south-east Asia. Vietnam, in particular, is the heart of that industry. When Trump initially announced reciprocal tariffs on April — well, announced in early April and they took effect a week later and then were suspended — but they were I think 46 per cent on Vietnam, which would have just been crushing for any of these shoe manufacturers. So Deckers, in its case, they pulled their full-year outlook because of uncertainty over global trade. The last time they updated investors was like up to $150mn increase in cost of goods sold because of tariffs.

Sonja Hutson

Wow.

Gregory Meyer

Again, the tariffs are in flux, and July 9th is when the reciprocal tariffs suspension is supposed to end. So time will tell, but that was an interesting one.

Sonja Hutson

Greg, Derek, with all this in mind, with all these winners and losers that we’ve just talked about, what is the big takeaway here about Donald Trump’s impact on the business space?

Derek Brower

I think the big takeaway is just how much risk now emanates directly from the Oval Office, because many of these companies were expecting some kind of tariff regime. They were expecting something a bit more predictable than what happened though. And as soon as they got on top of the tariffs, Trump was reducing the headline numbers and striking trade deals. And so it’s, it’s very, very difficult if you’re building a business to figure out what you’re going to be paying to import the raw materials. You don’t know whether there’s going to be a tariff on Canadian steel in a year. Realistically, you simply don’t. But that is a key input for some of those energy companies, for example, that we’re talking about. They have no idea. Trump could strike a deal with Mark Carney or announce one on Truth Social tomorrow morning. And then there are no steel tariffs or he could double them. There is simply no predictability about that.

Sonja Hutson

Greg, what’s the big takeaway for you?

Gregory Meyer

I think related to what Derek said is not only is it difficult to manage the very unpredictable policy environment, but it’s also . . . it’s a very personalised way of policymaking. A company might tell investors that they’re gonna raise prices because of tariffs, as Walmart did on May 15th in their earnings. And two days later, they might wake up to a post on Truth Social by the president saying, Walmart shouldn’t do this. They must eat the tariffs, quote unquote. Well, all I’m trying to say is it’s the leaders of these companies, I’m sure, are very aware of the risk of being singled out.

Derek Brower

The other thing I would say, Sonja, is the big, beautiful bill. And what’s really striking when you step back and look at some of the changes that have been made in that bill, of course, it preserves tax cuts. Fine. I think everybody expected that.

Sonja Hutson

Yeah, that was always gonna happen.

Derek Brower

Yeah, that was always gonna happen. But in the way that Trump has very carefully unpicked the Inflation Reduction Act in just six months is pretty astonishing, because a lot of investors came to the US after the Inflation Reduction Act was passed, because they believed those tax credits were going to last for at least 10 years and were safe from exactly what Trump has done happening. They believe that these tax credits could not be simply repealed by the next president. So easily and actually he’s done it in just a few months. And so it just makes the US suddenly a much riskier place to invest. And he’s done it in just a few short months.

Sonja Hutson

All right, I think we’re gonna take a quick break, and when we come back, we’re gonna answer some listener questions.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

We are back to answer some of your questions. Derek, Greg, I am gonna ask you a question that has been sent in by a Swamp Notes listener. And I’m gonna ask you to answer it as best you can. This one comes from Bettina writing in from Germany. Can Donald Trump’s influence be bought by expensive gifts or investment in his memecoins and family business?

Derek Brower

I think there’s two answers to this. Donald Trump and his family would say — and indeed, they did say, Eric Trump said in a recent interview with us — that there has never been a more above board family in the way they deal with things than the Trump family. The other answer to this would be, if it’s not influencing him, people certainly seem to be trying. Purchasing Donald Trump’s memecoin and trying to get dinner with him seems to be a way to be close to the president. And, of course, Donald Trump himself, as we and others have reported, offered to make many concessions on policy to people who donated to his presidential campaign last year. So, I think there are many ways, even if Donald Trump is not able to be bought — and I’m not weighing in on that, really, I’m just saying what he might say in response — I think people are certainly trying.

But while agrivoltaics seems to be gaining traction around the U.S. and worldwide, Arizona is still an agrivoltaics desert.
Agrivoltaics should be a shoo-in for Arizona, given its abundant sunshine and dwindling water supplies.
“Maybe we can change the conversation from ‘food versus energy’ to ‘sustaining food production because of energy,’” Barron-Gafford said.
This solar-centric model may be the key to scaling up agrivoltaics, given the swaths of solar already present in Arizona.","Under patches of shadow, Greg Barron-Gafford crouched to check on a row of artichokes. It was mid-April in the southern Arizona town of Oracle, which had already seen a string of 90-degree days in the previous few weeks, plus a 100-degree spike. Still, the plants appeared robust, their leaves lush and perky. Other plants — herbs, garlic, carrots — seemed to be thriving, too, despite the heat. The garden’s bounty had even drawn wild animals: Recently, gophers had raided the site, so Barron-Gafford and his colleagues were considering installing a buried fence to thwart them.

Part of the garden’s vitality was thanks to the 30 3-meter-high solar panels overhead, which provide crucial shade that keeps the crops underneath from drying out. About 30 feet away, another garden — that’s a generous word for it — sprawled forlornly under the full heat of the sun, its plants wilted and shriveled.

Barron-Gafford studies agrivoltaics, the practice of combining agriculture with solar energy generation. He and his team planted these experimental gardens at the Biosphere 2 research facility, seeking to better understand both the benefits and the practical challenges involved in implementing agrivoltaics. He has also helped develop agrivoltaics projects all around the world, working with communities in Kenya, Mexico, Morocco and elsewhere.

But while agrivoltaics seems to be gaining traction around the U.S. and worldwide, Arizona is still an agrivoltaics desert. Aside from Barron-Gafford’s pilot projects, solar fields and farmland tessellate across the Sonoran Desert, as unmingling as oil and water. Significant practical challenges have prevented the widespread adoption of agrivoltaics, from solar-unfriendly state policies to the entrenched skepticism of both farmers and utilities.

Barron-Gafford, of course, wants to change that.

AGRIVOLTAICS is often touted as a win-win for both solar generation and agriculture, especially in summer. Shade reduces crops’ heat stress and helps farmers save water: In one of Barron-Gafford’s studies, crops under panels needed 50% less irrigation than those fully exposed to the sun. In turn, the plants release water from their leaves, which cools solar panels and boosts their efficiency.

Agrivoltaics should be a shoo-in for Arizona, given its abundant sunshine and dwindling water supplies. By late June, 97% of the state faced moderate to exceptional drought, conditions that are becoming more frequent and intense with climate change. Agriculture alone consumes three-quarters of the state’s water. Now, mandated water cuts are making farming increasingly untenable, forcing farmers to sell their land for less thirsty enterprises, including solar development and generation.

Agrivoltaics could extend the lifespan of Arizona’s farms and bridge the two competing land uses. “Maybe we can change the conversation from ‘food versus energy’ to ‘sustaining food production because of energy,’” Barron-Gafford said.

Other locales have embraced agrivoltaics. One poster child for the practice is Jack’s Solar Garden in Longmont, Colorado. Once a hay farm struggling with water shortages, it now boasts 3,276 solar panels that power 300 homes and shelter a diversity of produce, from corn and raspberries to medicinal herbs. The panels stand 17 feet apart and about 6 feet off the ground, leaving enough room for the farmers to maneuver in between and underneath.

“We do better now selling electricity than we did growing hay,” said owner Byron Kominek. The business’s agricultural arm is also flourishing: His leafy greens grow 2 to 5 times larger than they did under the open sky.

“We do better now selling electricity than we did growing hay.”

Colorado’s solar-friendly policies have made Jack’s Solar Garden possible. In 2019, Gov. Jared Polis unveiled a plan to eliminate greenhouse emissions in the next few decades, spurring utilities to procure clean energy en masse, including from community solar projects like Jack’s Solar Garden. Kominek has a 20-year business agreement with Xcel Energy, the state’s largest utility, to sell clean energy to its customers. On top of a multitude of regional incentives, Colorado also exempts property taxes associated with the value of solar installations.

Arizona’s starkly different policy landscape makes it hard for farmers to replicate Jack’s Solar Garden’s success. The state lacks incentives for non-utility entities such as community parties to enter the solar playing field. Starting in 2017, Arizona slashed the margins of small-to-medium solar installations that sell surplus power back to the grid. Now, the credit for energy sales is 30% to 70% of the retail price, unlike in Colorado, which allows the same type of providers to sell at the buying rate.

“It takes a really long time to pay off the up-front investment in solar panels,” said Kate Bowman, regulatory director of the policy advocacy organization Vote Solar, of the state of Arizona’s non-utility-scale solar. “No project could ever pencil out.”

OVERALL, HOWEVER, solar is booming in Arizona, feeding a rise in energy demand. But it’s largely driven by the utility-scale development that is rapidly usurping the state’s prime farmland, drawing resentment from the remaining farmers. By 2040, nearly 90,000 acres of land in Arizona that currently grow crops are projected to be covered in utility-scale solar panels, according to a report by the American Farmland Trust.

And many Arizona farmers say they doubt that solar is compatible with farming. For Nancy Caywood, a 71-year-old alfalfa and cotton producer in Casa Grande, water is her biggest headache, but putting up solar panels to save on irrigation is out of the question, because the farming machines she uses are over 14 feet tall. “There’s no way that you could physically put those panels up that high,” Caywood said. “We don’t want solar on our farm, period.” Even if it were possible, erecting lofty-enough panels would be cost much more than installing lower ones.

Nearly 200 miles west, produce farmers in Yuma County, the winter vegetable capital of America, are also shrugging at the idea. John Boelts, a co-owner of Desert Premium Farms which specializes in salad crops, said that his primary concern is food contamination. Overhead structures might invite birds to perch or roost, then defecate on the crops below. “Foodborne illness is such a big risk,” Boelts said. As a precaution, his team doesn’t even harvest anything under power lines. (According to Kominek of Jack’s Solar Garden, bird droppings shouldn’t be an issue, since USDA standards require all produce be washed before sale.)

“We’ve let the agrivoltaics conversation be dominated by engineers and folks who have a more technical interest in agrivoltaics without asking a lot of hard and critical questions around who stands to benefit,” said Carrie Seay-Fleming, a sociologist who has worked with Barron-Gafford at the University of Arizona. “It’s not a silver bullet.”

IF FARMERS aren’t willing to put solar panels in their fields, could solar companies instead bring farming to their facilities?

Barron-Gafford aims to demonstrate that it’s possible. For another project, his team plans to grow desert crops and vegetables on 10 acres of a 100-acre solar array in Casa Grande.

This solar-centric model may be the key to scaling up agrivoltaics, given the swaths of solar already present in Arizona. But in Barron-Gafford’s experience, utilities worry that farming might interfere with energy production. Solar panels are usually fairly low-slung, often placed directly on the ground. For this experiment, his team made several concessions to the landowner, the energy company AES: Crops must be less than 4 feet tall, the average height of the panels, and grown between the rows of panels rather than directly underneath them. That means the plants will be shaded only during early morning or just before sunset.

Moreover, retrofitting utility-scale solar installations to be agrivoltaics-ready is no easy task. The ground beneath the panels is usually cleared of vegetation to simplify maintenance. For the new project, Barron-Gafford’s team spent a grueling few weeks in April laying down irrigation lines, tilling and adding compost to the compacted soil around the panels.

Then, in May, the team hit a fresh obstacle: Most of Barron-Gafford’s research funding, which had come from the Departments of Agriculture and Energy, was axed. Still, the team is committed to squeezing out one harvest by summer’s end, to avoid two years of preparation ending with nothing to show for it.

“We’re hoping that that (people) will care once they see what’s possible,” Barron-Gafford said. “I do think that humans have a great capacity to work through problems and figure out a way.”

By Brian Eckhouse

As Donald Trump’s $3.4 trillion fiscal package moved through Congress, there was some relief in the renewables industry that a proposed excise tax on wind and solar projects had been expunged.

Still, with the White House readying today’s bill signing ceremony, make no mistake: the US president’s victory marks a deep setback for the shift to clean energy. His legislation will aggressively phase out tax credits for wind turbines and solar panels, threatening many projects.

Energy Innovation, a climate policy think tank, predicts the law will significantly crimp the expansion of renewables. In an analysis this week, it forecast that about 200 gigawatts of wind capacity and 150 gigawatts of solar won’t get built that otherwise would have by 2035.

That period roughly coincides with a decade of soaring electricity demand, a stark reversal after a generation of sluggish growth. By 2030, Texas — a state that invested heavily in clean energy — may need the equivalent of 30 nuclear reactors, or 30 gigawatts, to quench the thirst of data centers that power artificial intelligence.

Source: BloombergNEF

Renewables were positioned to be leading providers of that supply. Utility-scale solar last year accounted for 61% of US capacity additions, or 30 gigawatts, according to the Energy Information Administration.

Solar was primed for further growth because it’s the cheapest domestic electric source, batteries capable of deploying excess power in the evening have become mainstream, and it’s quicker to build than natural gas-fired plants or atomic reactors.

And, of course, there was former President Joe Biden’s landmark 2022 climate law. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. estimated in 2023 that his signature legislation would ultimately cost about $1.2 trillion and spur even more in private investments.

But Trump’s bill yanks or dials back provisions in the Biden law, and in the process creates more questions about how the country will power the first wave of the AI boom.

Environmental Protection Agency, 606 U.S. ___ (2025), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the court held that the fuel producers have Article III standing to challenge the Environmental Protection Agency's approval under the Clean Air Act of California regulations requiring automakers to manufacture more electric vehicles and fewer gasoline-powered vehicles.[1][2]

Background

[edit]

Under the Clean Air Act, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approved California regulations that require automakers to manufacture more electric vehicles and fewer gasoline-powered vehicles with a goal of decreasing emissions from liquid fuels. The regulations require automakers to limit average greenhouse-gas emissions across their vehicle fleets and manufacture a certain percentage of electric vehicles. Several producers of fuels such as gasoline and ethanol sued the EPA in the D.C. Circuit, arguing that the EPA lacked authority to approve the California regulations because they target global climate change rather than local California air quality problems as required by the Clean Air Act. They submitted standing declarations explaining that California’s regulations depress demand for liquid fuel by requiring vehicles that use less or no liquid fuel, causing the fuel producers monetary injury. California’s own estimates indicated the regulations would cause substantial reductions in demand for gasoline exceeding $1 billion beginning in 2020 and increasing to over $10 billion in 2030.[1]

EPA did not challenge the fuel producers’ standing in the D.C. Circuit. California, as well as other States adopting California’s regulations, intervened to defend the EPA's approval. California argued that the fuel producers lacked standing because automobile manufacturers would not change course if EPA’s decision were vacated given the ""surging consumer demand"" for electric vehicles. The D.C. Circuit held that the fuel producers lacked Article III standing, finding they failed to establish that automakers would likely respond to invalidation of the regulations by producing fewer electric vehicles and more gasoline-powered vehicles.[1]

The country is yet again bracing for more infernal weather.

The National Weather Service’s Climate Prediction Center predicts a high likelihood of swaths of the West being saddled with above-average temperatures in July. About 130 million people live in areas where temperatures were predicted to top 90 degrees the first half of this week. From Spokane, Washington, to Missoula, Montana, to Summit, New Jersey, local coverage is already encouraging residents to prioritize heat safety this Fourth of July by staying cool and hydrated.

After all, heat causes or contributes to an average of more than 1,220 annual deaths in the country; within just the first week and a half of July 2024, 37 heat-related deaths had already been tallied.

But as the country boils, climate action remains on thin ice. This summer’s backdrop of searing heat is a tragic reminder of how much President Donald Trump’s administration has stripped away climate tools and protections built precisely for moments like this.

From the outset of his second term, Trump has leveraged the full weight of the presidency to crush climate and environmental initiatives. Among his first executive orders on inauguration day was initiating the U.S.’ withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, a repeat of his damaging actions in 2017.

Within the first hundred days of Trump’s second term, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin proclaimed “the greatest and most consequential day of deregulation in U.S. history” by unveiling 31 environmental rollbacks with detrimental implications for clean air and water and public health. Among the stunning standouts are the “reconsideration of wastewater regulations for oil and gas development” and the “reconsideration of multiple National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants.”

Of course, the Trump administration’s decision to scoff at established climate science and long-standing policies safeguarding the environment and human health was predictable. However, the no-holds-barred, scorched-earth approach and rapid-fire rollout of these rollbacks have been a sight to behold, even for environmentalists who had been bracing for the worst.

Obama-era EPA head Gina McCarthy condemned the agency’s recent actions as “absolutely illogical and indefensible,” warning that “the most vulnerable among us, our kids and grandkids, will suffer the most.”

Indeed, the Trump administration’s indefensible climate stances cast a shadow over our ability to manage extreme heat. At the Department of Health and Human Services, sweeping staff reductions have hampered both the funding pipelines that facilitate state- and local-level heat wave responses and digital educational resources. Many heat specialists working across the federal government have been let go.

Promising initiatives, such as UCLA’s Center of Excellence for Heat Resilient Communities, have been financially gutted. A federal initiative that kept air conditioning costs affordable for under-resourced households has lost all its personnel. Former President Joe Biden’s novel National Heat Strategy, a comprehensive six-year framework to confront the country’s extreme heat problem, now leads to a discontinued webpage.

Heat waves are on track to grow longer, more severe and more frequent.

Why? This destruction is necessary to maintain the climate denial narrative.

Much of the programs that are now in tatters centered on climate adaptation, which involves reshaping and strengthening our systems to withstand the reality of heat events. But if we acknowledge that we must adapt to live with extreme heat, then wouldn’t that imply — by extension — a parallel urgency to mitigate the problem at its source?

The literature indicates that heat waves are on track to grow longer, more severe and more frequent under climate change, a trajectory that demands we reckon with our perilous reliance on fossil fuels and catalyze a meaningful shift toward renewables.

Unfortunately, this sensible path remains elusive so long as the Trump administration engages in the willful rejection of climate responsibility, an approach that promises lasting harm as the planet unyieldingly swelters.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/250630-new-york-fruit-vendor-brooklyn-bridge-heat-ac-1159p-058236.jpg",N,,2025-07-05 09:06:44.063021

Pair fossil fuel gains with long-term clean energy plays, and hedge against inflation.","The Senate's 2025 Tax and Spending Bill has ignited a seismic shift in energy markets, pitting fossil fuel incumbents against renewables in a battle for investor dollars. While the legislation fuels short-term gains for coal and oil drillers, its penalties on clean energy—particularly those reliant on Chinese components—risk ceding global clean tech leadership to Beijing. For investors, this is a moment to dissect sector-specific valuations and geopolitical trends, while hedging against the bill's unintended economic fallout.

The Fossil Fuel Rally: Short-Term Winners, Long-Term Risks

The Senate bill's pro-fossil fuel provisions—opening federal lands for drilling, slashing royalties, and subsidizing carbon capture—have created a near-term boom. reveals a 40% surge, outpacing broader markets. Similarly, oil drillers like Pioneer Natural Resources (PVX) and coal miners like Alliance Resource Partners (ARLP) have rallied on expectations of expanded production.

But this rally is built on shaky foundations. The bill's $3.3 trillion deficit expansion and rising U.S. debt could trigger inflation spikes, squeezing margins for fossil fuel firms. Moreover, global decarbonization trends—driven by the EU's Carbon Border Tax and China's renewables dominance—mean long-term demand for coal and oil is in secular decline. Investors should treat fossil fuel stocks as tactical trades, not buy-and-hold positions.

Clean Energy's Crossroads: Penalties, Politics, and Tesla's Outcry

The bill's most damaging provisions target renewables. By phasing out wind and solar tax credits post-2027 and penalizing projects using Chinese components, it risks kneecapping U.S. clean energy growth. . Tesla (TSLA) and its CEO Elon Musk have been vocal critics, calling the bill a “disaster” for energy affordability and U.S. innovation.

Musk's ire isn't just about subsidies. The bill's elimination of EV tax credits ($7,500 per car) and solar incentives directly threatens Tesla's margins. With Q2 2025 deliveries projected to fall 11–20% year-over-year, the firm faces a compounding crisis of declining sales and rising costs. Yet, this creates an opportunity for investors in relative winners:

- First Solar (FSLR): A U.S.-focused solar manufacturer insulated from Chinese supply chain penalties.

- Rooftop solar firms (like Sunrun (RUN)): Less reliant on federal subsidies, their distributed model avoids project-scale penalties.

Geopolitical Energy Trends: U.S. Cedes Clean Tech Leadership

The bill's China-focused penalties are a double-edged sword. While aiming to boost domestic manufacturing, they risk pushing renewable projects toward foreign alternatives—exactly what China wants. Beijing now dominates 80% of global solar panel production and 60% of lithium battery supply chains. By penalizing U.S. companies that use Chinese components, the Senate is accelerating a “decoupling” that hands Beijing's clean tech giants a monopoly.

This geopolitical reality creates a paradox: U.S. fossil fuels may thrive today, but their global market share will shrink as the world transitions to renewables. Meanwhile, China's clean tech dominance could fuel its economic ascendancy, creating long-term risks for U.S. energy security and corporate competitiveness.

Investment Strategy: Hedging Between Sectors

Investors should adopt a barbell strategy:

1. Short-term fossil fuel exposure: Deploy 20–30% of capital in drillers (e.g., Pioneer Natural Resources) or coal plays (e.g., Peabody Energy) to capture near-term upside.

2. Long-term clean energy bets: Allocate 15–25% to “China-proof” stocks like First Solar or rooftop solar firms, which can thrive even under the bill's constraints.

3. Defensive hedges: Use inverse energy ETFs (e.g., DNO) or inflation-linked bonds to protect against the bill's inflationary pressures and rising energy costs.

Avoid blanket bets on broad renewable ETFs (e.g., Invesco Solar ETF (TAN)), as many holdings rely on Chinese supply chains.

The Unintended Consequences: Rising Costs and Lost Productivity

The bill's true cost isn't just in job losses—it's in stifling innovation. The American Clean Power Association estimates the legislation will raise consumer energy costs by 8–10% by 2036. Meanwhile, fossil fuel subsidies ($20 billion annually) distort markets, favoring outdated tech over renewables. This misallocation of capital risks U.S. productivity growth, as industries pivot to cheaper, less efficient energy sources.

Final Take: Ride the Rally, but Keep Eyes on the Horizon

The Senate bill is a short-term tailwind for fossil fuels and a headwind for renewables. Investors who ignore the geopolitical stakes—China's clean tech supremacy—risk being left behind when global markets demand sustainable energy solutions. Pair fossil fuel gains with long-term clean energy plays, and hedge against inflation. The energy sector's next chapter isn't just about today's profits—it's about who will control tomorrow's energy landscape.",,N,,2025-07-05 08:04:16.412609

During the hottest days of the hot spell the ISO was noticing a decline in operating reserves. On June 29, the grid operated normally but emergency operations were a possibility to maintain system reliability. The morning of June 30, the ISO noted potential afternoon strains on the grid on a cooler Wednesday. “Special Case Resources and Emergency Demand Response Program resources are needed,” the notice indicated, between 2 and 9 p.m. in zones of the state that included Western New York.

When that notice was sent dual fuels, natural gas and nuclear were 83% of the energy being generated. Hydropower was at 15% while solar was around 3% and wind was at 0.29%.

We’re not sure Gov. Kathy Hochul could have timed her directive to the New York Power Authority to build a new nuclear plant somewhere in Upstate New York any better. After years of dumping dollar after dollar after dollar into wind and solar power, they produced a whopping 3.29% of the state’s electricity. It was renewable energy’s time to shine – and it fizzled.

Years of the Independent System Operator’s warnings about looming power shortages took on new urgency a couple of weeks ago. New York always knew it couldn’t pin all of its renewable energy hope on wind and solar power. Reliable sources of power that aren’t dependent on weather have been part of every zero emission power grid model since the state passed the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act in 2019. But in 2019 the reliable power source didn’t exist yet.

There was hope it would be battery storage, but as the CLCPA’s deadlines loom that technology isn’t ready for prime time. Environmentalists have deemed natural gas not clean enough to continue using. So, we find ourselves going back to the future with nuclear power plants.

Hochul’s decision to pursue nuclear power to meet the state’s power needs calls into question the millions of dollars the state and federal government have thrown at solar and wind power over the past couple of decades only to find that nuclear power or keeping natural gas in use to generate electricity are the best options to make sure the lights come on when you flip a switch, that your car charges when you plug it in at night and your refrigerator continues running during a heat wave.

The state must take the best options to guarantee consistent, reliable power throughout the state.

U.S. federal tax credits for EV buyers will end on September 30, ending incentives of up to $7,500.

Analysts expect a short-term sales rush followed by slower EV adoption.

Congress cites long-term savings of $169 billion as a key reason for ending the program.

The rollback contrasts with global trends, especially China’s continued EV subsidies.

A seismic shift is underway in the U.S. electric vehicle market as Congress moves to terminate federal tax credits for EV purchases, effective September 30.

The decision has triggered a surge in EV demand, with buyers scrambling to secure up to $7,500 in incentives for new cars and $4,000 for used ones before the window closes.

End of an Era for Federal EV Support

First introduced in 2008, the federal EV tax credit was a cornerstone of bipartisan efforts to boost clean energy and reduce dependence on foreign oil.

Over the years, it evolved significantly. The program was expanded in 2022 to include leased vehicles and lifted manufacturer sales caps, reflecting a growing policy emphasis on environmental sustainability and industrial transformation.

Now, as that era comes to a close, industry experts anticipate both a short-term sales bump and a longer-term chill. Barclays auto analyst Dan Levy predicts that the expiration of the tax credit will likely slow adoption rates in the coming years, particularly among cost-sensitive buyers. A Harvard study supports this view, projecting a 6% drop in EV market penetration by 2030 if the credits disappear as planned.

Fiscal Goals Drive Policy Shift

This rollback, however, comes with fiscal upsides for the federal government. By eliminating the credits, Congress estimates it will save nearly $169 billion over the next decade. That figure has appealed to lawmakers seeking to rein in spending while still offering automakers certain regulatory relief. t

The bill also eliminates penalties for failing to meet Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, easing pressure on legacy carmakers still navigating the transition to electric mobility.

Amid these changes, the bill notably omits two controversial provisions that were floated during earlier discussions. A proposed $250 annual fee for EV owners and a requirement for the U.S. Postal Service to sell off its electric delivery vehicles did not make it into the final legislation. These exclusions were welcomed by environmental groups but did little to blunt the broader impact of the tax credit repeal.

China Ramps Up as U.S. Pulls Back

The timing of the rollback has raised eyebrows internationally as well. While the U.S. trims back incentives, countries like China continue to double down. Chinese subsidies cover a large share of EV costs and are reinforced by aggressive infrastructure development.

This disparity has fueled concern among industry advocates who warn the U.S. could be ceding ground in the global EV race. The Electrification Coalition, a non-profit pushing for EV adoption, recently said the bill “forfeits America’s role in that future to China.”

Consumers Rush to Beat the Deadline

For now, U.S. consumers appear eager to take advantage of the credits before they vanish. Dealerships report a spike in showroom traffic and pre-orders, especially for models eligible for full tax relief. But whether that momentum can be sustained after the incentive ends remains an open question.

The coming months will likely test the resilience of the U.S. EV market. Without federal subsidies, pricing pressure may steer buyers back toward gasoline-powered options, complicating the country’s path toward carbon neutrality.",https://coincentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/louis-velazquez-588272-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-07-05 05:00:45.447423

The president is expected to sign the nearly 900-page bill into law at 5 p.m. on Friday. Local organizations in healthcare and food assistance are also sharing their reaction. Here’s what lawmakers and organizations are saying about how the bill will impact Western New York and the Finger Lakes region:

What local Congressional representatives are saying:

Rep. Claudia Tenney, who represents much of the Finger Lakes region, expressed support for the bill on X. She said the bill is essential to the president’s plans to cut taxes, raise wages, strengthen border security, and boost American energy production.

After the final version of the bill passed in the House on Thursday, Tenney said “this landmark legislation will change our country for the better.” She thanked House Speaker Mike Johnson for his efforts to get Republicans behind the bill.

Earlier this week, a group gathered outside of Rep. Tenney’s office in Canandaigua to protest against the Medicaid cuts in the bill. Protesters said the rollbacks will leave people in the community without access to healthcare.

Rep. Joe Morelle, who represents the Rochester area, criticized the bill’s $1.2 trillion in cuts to Medicaid and food stamps. During an address in D.C., he said the bill will kick 1.5 million New Yorkers off their health insurance. Morelle also said the bill will raise health premiums by nearly $2,000 for some and will force New York counties to pay $266 million in food assistance for families in need.

In a statement after the bill passed, Morelle said House Republicans have pushed through the most “damaging and heartless piece of legislation in generations.” Here is the statement:

“House Republicans have forced through the most damaging and heartless piece of legislation in generations—a betrayal of the people we are elected to serve.”

“This bill will strip health insurance from 17 million Americans and slash food assistance for nearly 3 million Americans, including 900,000 seniors. It includes the largest cut to Medicaid in U.S. history, defunds Planned Parenthood, and raises health insurance premiums for some New Yorkers by nearly $2,000. Meanwhile, it adds $3.3 trillion to the national deficit—all to fund tax breaks for Donald Trump’s billionaire friends.”

“It’s not budgeting—it’s cruelty. These aren’t just numbers—they’re neighbors, families, and frontline workers trying to get ahead. This bill was never about helping working families; it was about rewarding the wealthy and well-connected at their expense. Like so many of you, I’m angry, frustrated, and deeply disappointed—but I am not done fighting. We are going to keep standing up for the American people. This fight isn’t over. Not by a long shot.”

Rep. Nick Langworthy, who represents parts of Buffalo and the Southern Tier, spoke in support of the bill. While speaking in D.C., he said the bill will help Americans to build independent lives with lower taxes.

“They want more people dependent on government and fewer people building independent lives. And Republicans will not let that happen,” Langworthy said.

What local lawmakers are saying:

Monroe County Executive Adam Bello said the bill’s cuts to Medicaid and food assistance with be “devastating” locally and across the nation. Here is his statement:

“The consequences of today’s Congressional passage of the federal budget bill will be devastating to Monroe County, New York State, and the rest of the nation. Extending tax cuts for the wealthy on the backs of working people by cutting Medicaid and food assistance will damage the health and well-being of our families, and the resulting federal deficit increase will jeopardize our children and grandchildren’s financial future. Despite the upheaval this disastrous legislation will cause, I am committed to working with our government, business and community partners to find ways to support the Monroe County residents who will feel the direct impact.”

Patrick Reilly, the chairman of the Monroe County Republican Party, praised the bill, saying it’s delivering on President Trump’s promises. Here is his statement:

“The passage of the Big Beautiful Bill is great news for the American People and yet another example of promises made, promises kept! The bill is now headed to President Trump’s desk to be signed on America’s Big Beautiful Birthday! This July 4th just got a lot more special.”

What are local healthcare and food assistance saying:

Foodlink, a Rochester-based nonprofit that aims to fight food insecurity through a network of food pantries across the 10-county region, expressed concerns over the cuts to SNAP benefits. Foodlink’s president and CEO, Julia Tedesco, called SNAP the nation’s most effective anti-poverty program. Foodlink serves more than 700 community partners. Here is the statement from Tedesco:

“The budget reconciliation bill passed today by Congress will slash SNAP ($200B) and Medicaid ($900B) at a time when the costs of food and healthcare remain prohibitively high. It is an unconscionable policy choice that will impact the health outcomes of our neighbors for generations.”

“The emergency food system we convene in the Rochester and Finger Lakes region is experiencing an unprecedented need and some of the highest food-insecurity rates in recent history. New faces at food pantries; longer lines at soup kitchens; and more frequent and costly food orders to keep their shelves stocked. The families they serve make difficult choices every day, and it is clear to us that this legislation will make their lives even more difficult.”

“SNAP is our nation’s most effective anti-poverty program. It provides 9x more meals than all of our nation’s 200 food banks combined. The impact of these cuts will be significant. While the passage of this legislation is disappointing, we will continue to show up – alongside hundreds of our partners – to provide food to those who need our help. We will step in, when our government fails to. Our mission calls on us to end hunger and build healthier communities. The challenges ahead are considerable, but with your support, we will continue to advocate for solutions that support all of our neighbors experiencing food insecurity.”

News10NBC spoke with Bob Boyd, the CEO of St. Peter’s Kitchen, about the SNAP benefit rollbacks under the bill. He said the food pantry will likely have to work harder to serve even more people. St. Peter’s Kitchen currently serves 300 to 400 meals a day, six days a week. You can see our story here.

1199SEIU, the union that represents caregivers, clinical workers, and service workers at the University of Rochester, expressed concerns over cuts to Medicaid. Yvonne Armstrong, president of 1199SEIU United Healthcare Workers East, released this statement:

“This bill is theft on a massive scale of Americans’ healthcare and financial security, while enriching billionaires and radically escalating a repressive police state that threatens the rights and freedoms of all of us.”

“Cutting $1 trillion from Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act will be disastrous for our healthcare system. It will cause tens of thousands of Americans to die annually, force healthcare facilities and services to shut down, create longer wait times and higher costs for everyone, and blow gigantic holes in states’ budgets as they try to make up for the loss of critical funding. The loss of tens of thousands of good-paying healthcare jobs will devastate families and disrupt local economies, especially in struggling urban and rural communities.”

“Republicans nationwide ran on a platform of protecting Medicaid, but out of moral deceit and cowardice they just voted for the largest cut in history. They betrayed every child, every senior, every person with a disability, and every other American who relies on Medicaid for lifesaving care. The consequences are on them.”

“Voters will not forget how Republicans sold out the health of our communities so they could give tax cuts to themselves and their rich friends. As a union of 450,000 caregivers who will be on the frontlines of the looming healthcare crisis, we will not stand by while vulnerable patients are abandoned by morally-bankrupt Republican politicians.”

What state lawmakers are saying:

Gov. Kathy Hochul criticized the bill, saying it will take health care away from 1.5 million New Yorkers and take food assistance benefits away from 3 million. Here is the statement:

“Today’s vote makes it official: all seven New York Republicans in Congress voted to rip health care away from 1.5 million New Yorkers and jeopardize SNAP benefits for nearly 3 million more. They had two chances to stand up to Donald Trump and fight for the people they serve. They failed both times, gambling with their constituents’ lives to pay for billionaire tax breaks.”

“To the 48,000 New Yorkers set to lose their coverage in Rep. LaLota’s district, the 48,000 in Rep. Garbarino’s, the 52,000 in Rep. Malliotakis’, the 31,000 in Rep. Lawler’s, the 44,000 in Rep. Stefanik’s, the 35,000 in Rep. Langworthy’s, and the 31,000 in Rep. Tenney’s: your members of Congress may have given up on you, but I never will. As Governor, your family’s health and well-being is my top priority. And I will keep fighting every single day to shield you from the cruelty and chaos coming out of Washington.”

Gerard Kassar, chair of the New York State Conservative Party, praised the bill, saying it will root out billions of dollars in federal waste and provide tax relief to Americans:

“The New York State Conservative Party applauds President Trump and Republicans in Congress for passing bold legislation that will root out billions of dollars in federal waste and provide tax relief to millions of Americans, including social security recipients whose buying power was devoured by President Biden’s rapacious inflationary policies.”

“Renewing and expanding the Trump tax cuts isn’t just smart policy — it’s common sense. These cuts will give millions of Americans the breathing room they need. At the same time, this plan roots out hundreds of billions in waste and bureaucratic mismanagement — the kind of Washington nonsense taxpayers are sick of funding. It protects the safety net for those who truly depend on it while creating new opportunities for millions more to rise. This is what responsible governance looks like — not more spending, not more red tape, but a government that works for the people, not the other way around.”",https://www.whec.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/cropped-WHEC-favicon-logo-32x32.png,N,,2025-07-05 05:01:28.281813

The Republican sweeping Big, Beautiful Bill will eliminate the $7,500 tax credit for new EV and plug-in hybrid purchases — a key incentive created under the Inflation Reduction Act.

A $4,000 credit for buyers of used electric vehicles will also get the axe on September 30.

Critics of the credit argue it reins in spending on programs that haven't lived up to expectations.

'Following the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, there have been significant concerns about the cost of these tax credits,' Bernie Moreno, a Republican Senator from Ohio and former car dealership manager, wrote in an open letter.

But supporters of the tax break see a missed opportunity.

'It's almost hilariously hypocritical and short-sighted — but that's the Trump Administration,' Robby DeGraff, the manager of consumer insights at AutoPacific, told DailyMail.com.

'It's really all a shame, especially from a paranoid administration so hellbent on ensuring ""consumer choice.""'

Buyers can still qualify for credits on eligible vehicles purchased before September 30.

Republicans have long criticized the EV credits, arguing the incentives were out of step with consumer demand and too generous to an industry they see as premature.

EV adoption has steadily grown since the program launched. But the vehicles still make up just around 10 percent of the overall new car market — falling short of the rapid transition lawmakers envisioned.

The credit was designed with two main goals in mind: supercharge domestic manufacturing and encourage Americans to transition to lower-emission vehicles.

DeGraff outlined three key ways he believes the removal of the credit under Trump's bill will backfire.

First, he said the bill will push car prices even higher.

In June, it cost around $49,000 to drive a new set of wheels off a dealership lot. That pushed the average monthly payment above $700.

Right now, Americans are paying a premium for electric vehicles, in part due to the costs of ramping up domestic production.

The now-expiring credit helped offset those investment costs for consumers, but only for vehicles built largely in the US.

Second, DeGraf said the tax bill will crush American manufacturing.

'Slower sales and demand will lead to production pauses at plants and consequently layoffs,' he said.

'Perhaps the comical thing to consider, is that many of these states that do build EVs and have received massive investments and had automakers employ massive amounts of workers are Republican states.'

Finally, DeGraff said it makes it harder for US automakers to compete globally.

Major Chinese automakers have received huge subsidies for their vehicles.

Companies like BYD, Nio, XPeng, and Zeekr have built competitive, low cost vehicles in highly automated factories.

The cars typically have higher build quality, electric range, and technology, all for a cheaper price. And they're coming to global markets, where American manufacturers want to be competitive.

China and EU officials are currently negotiating how to bring the cheap EVs to the European market without crushing the continent's local carmakers.

American delegates are reportedly not involved in that negotiation.

Detroit's big three carmakers likely aren't having their voices heard in the market, which is the largest in the world.

Meanwhile, some of America's biggest carmaking employers — including GM, Ford, Stellantis, Toyota, Nissan, Honda, and their parts suppliers — are already under pressure.

Carmakers are paying 25 percent tariffs on some of their vehicles and parts shipped to the US.

GM expects to pay between $4 billion to $5 billion on President Donald Trump's automotive tariffs. Ford is expecting a $2 billion levy bill. Both companies said they will slash profits to pay for the taxes.",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/04/17/100014423-0-image-a-64_1751645119691.jpg,N,,2025-07-05 03:05:10.247018

Published: 7/4/2025, 7:29:35 PM EDT

Congress passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act on July 3.

The mammoth bill, which is more than 940 pages, was the result of weeks of intraparty and bicameral negotiations among House and Senate Republicans.

Once signed by the president, the legislation will implement sweeping changes to U.S. policy and funding over a 10-year period in order to carry out President Donald Trump’s second-term agenda.

That includes making the 2017 tax cuts permanent; tax breaks on tips, overtime, and Social Security income; completing the border wall; $150 billion in defense spending; and repealing so-called green energy tax credits.

Here are the main components of the bill.

2017 Tax Cuts Extended

The centerpiece of the legislation is its extension of the tax cuts initially included in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 during Trump’s first term in office.

That law slashed marginal tax rates across the board, with most brackets seeing around a 2 percent to 4 percent cut. If these cuts aren’t extended, tax rates will return to their pre-2017 levels at the end of fiscal 2025 on Sept. 30—an eventuality that Republicans are anxious to avoid.

Child Tax Credit Boosted

The bill would boost the child tax credit from $2,000 to $2,200, and make the credit permanent.

Taxes on Overtime, Car Loans, Tips Reduced

The bill would implement some of Trump’s core campaign promises on tax policy, reducing taxes on tips, overtime pay, and car loans.

Taxpayers would be allowed to deduct the first $25,000 in income earned from tips; up to $12,500 in income from overtime pay for single filers or up to $25,000 for joint filers; and up to $10,000 of car loan interest on American-made vehicles.

$6,000 Social Security Deduction for Seniors

Instead of Trump’s “no taxes on Social Security,” the bill would allow seniors to deduct $6,000 of their Social Security income, with that amount decreasing once income passes $75,000 for single filers or $150,000 for joint filers.

Single filers who make $175,000 or more, or joint filers with an income of over $250,000, will not be eligible for the deduction.

Funding Immigration and Border Security

The legislation would dedicate $150 billion toward immigration enforcement in line with some of the core promises Trump made on the campaign trail.

That includes nearly $30 billion for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency largely responsible for carrying out Trump’s mass deportation operation, alongside $13.5 billion in grants for state and local governments who assist with the effort. The bill allocates $45 billion for the detention of illegal immigrants.

Another $46.5 billion is dedicated to the construction of a wall along the U.S.–Mexico border.

The funding will cover expenditures through the end of fiscal 2029.

Defense

The bill would appropriate $157 billion toward defense, with $29 billion going toward enhancing U.S. maritime capabilities and shipbuilding, $25 billion slated for munitions, and $25 billion dedicated to the “Golden Dome” missile defense project.

The funding will cover expenditures through the end of fiscal 2029.

Clean Energy Tax Credit Cuts

Several clean energy tax credits included in the Inflation Reduction Act are being cut, beginning as early as 2025.

The electric vehicle tax credit would end on Sept. 30. Other clean energy projects, including hydrogen, wind, and solar, would need to be online by either Dec. 31, 2027, or Jan. 1, 2028, depending on the type of project, to retain their tax credits.

Medicaid and Rural Hospitals

The bill would seek to reduce Medicaid spending by imposing an 80-hour monthly work requirement for able-bodied adults to receive benefits.

It also reduces the “provider tax”—the rate at which states tax hospitals and doctors to pay for their Medicaid programs—from 6 percent to 3.5 percent in states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Ten states that didn’t expand their programs will see no changes.

To offset fears that these changes would harm rural hospitals, the bill allocates $50 billion to support such facilities.

The bill would block abortion clinics from receiving Medicaid funding for one year.

SNAP Cuts

The bill would, for the first time, require states to contribute to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps. The amount would vary based on a state’s payment error rate, but would fall between 5 percent and 15 percent.

However, Alaska and Hawaii can apply for a waiver from this provision if they are making a good-faith effort to reduce their error rates.

It would also increase states’ share of administrative costs to 75 percent, up from the current 50 percent rate.

$5 Trillion Debt Ceiling Increase

The bill would increase the U.S. debt ceiling by $5 trillion. This provision is one of the most pressing items in the bill as the Treasury approaches a default sometime in the coming months.

Paul and House conservatives have been outspoken in their opposition to such a steep increase in the debt limit.

$40,000 SALT Cap

One of the most divisive issues in crafting the bill has been the state and local tax (SALT) deduction, which was capped at $10,000 in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The Senate bill will increase that cap to $40,000 annually, increasing by 1 percent for five years instead of the 10 years initially sought by its supporters as a compromise. Beginning in 2030, the cap will return to $10,000.

SALT allows tax payers to deduct a portion of their state and local taxes from their federal taxable income. The program is controversial with conservatives, who view it as favoring blue state taxpayers over those in comparably low-tax red states.

However, House moderates like Rep. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.) have made an increased SALT cap a redline to win their vote.

Education Policies Tweaked

The bill would make several tweaks to federal education policy.

It would reduce Pell Grant eligibility for high-income students and students with a full ride. It proposes two federal student loan repayment plans, including one traditional repayment plan and one income-based repayment plan.

Additionally, it would tax college and university endowments at a variable rate—either 1.4 percent, 4 percent, or 8 percent—based on the institutions’ wealth.

What Was Cut

The Senate’s nonpartisan referee, parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough, ruled that many provisions in earlier Senate committee drafts of the legislation were ineligible for passage under the filibuster-proof reconciliation process. Had they not been cut, Republicans would need 60 votes to pass the bill.

Those provisions included one empowering states to enforce immigration law, multiple provisions related to the federal workforce, and a provision financially rewarding cost-cutting measures by government agencies.

Sen. Mike Lee’s (R-Utah) proposal to sell off federal lands, which caused a firestorm of controversy online, was also left out.

Another proposal to cut the $200 excise tax, and regulations on silencers and certain types of firearms, was also ruled ineligible for the reconciliation process.

During an amendment vote in the Senate, senators voted 99-1 to remove a 10-year ban on states from regulating artificial intelligence.

Republicans also removed a measure, dubbed a “revenge tax,” that would have let Trump impose taxes on foreign companies from nations that tax U.S. firms. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that after negotiations, the provision was no longer necessary.

MacDonough also rejected a pay cut for Federal Reserve employees and a repeal of programs authorized by the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, among other rulings that would have to pass through the chamber as regular bills.",https://i.ntd.com/assets/uploads/2025/07/id1077279-EpochImages-5546357861KO.jpg-900x506.webp,N,,2025-07-05 07:03:25.720944

Bloomberg News

(TNS)

WASHINGTON — Business investors and wealthy Americans are among the biggest winners in President Donald Trump’s tax bill. Those hit the hardest by the sweeping package include elite universities, which face new levies, and immigrants.

The House passed the bill in a 218-214 vote just a day ahead of Trump’s self-imposed July 4 deadline.

Here’s who won and who lost in the legislative centerpiece of the president’s domestic agenda:

Winners

Multimillionaires

The rich gain the ability to pass more wealth on to their heirs and dodge a tax increase. The bill includes $4.5 trillion worth of tax cuts, according to a Saturday estimate from the Joint Committee on Taxation.

The estate tax exemption rises to $15 million for individuals—totaling $30 million for married couples—and then adjust with inflation. The 2017 Trump income tax rate cuts also become permanent, with benefits skewing toward the wealthy.

Residents of high-tax states

The limit on the state and local tax deduction rises to $40,000 annually for a five-year period. The write-off phases out for taxpayers who make more than $500,000 per year. After the five-year period, the limit snaps back to the current $10,000 limit imposed in the 2017 tax law.

Small business owners

The 2017 law that allowed pass-through business to deduct up to 20% of their qualified business income from their taxable income is permanently extended beginning in the tax year 2026. The deduction is available to owners of sole proprietorships, LLCs and partnerships.

Private equity

The carried interest tax break benefiting private equity, venture capital and real estate partnerships is maintained, despite the president’s push to eliminate it. Private equity also won an expanded interest expensing tax break.

Domestic car dealers

Up to $10,000 a year in loan interest for U.S.-made cars becomes tax deductible through 2028, a boon to auto dealers looking to close sales. But the break phases out slowly for individuals with more than $100,000 in income and couples with more than $200,000.

Manufacturers

The bill revives several favorable tax rules for businesses, including bonus depreciation for the cost of production upgrades and a research and development tax break, winning the endorsement of the National Association of Manufacturers. The final legislation makes permanent those breaks, which were temporary in an earlier version of the bill that passed the House in May.

Fossil fuel producers

Industries like coal, oil and natural gas win tax breaks and new requirements to open up more federal land for drilling, while breaks for competing clean energy technologies are phased out.

Elderly and tipped workers

In a nod to some of Trump’s populist campaign promises, taxpayers 65 and older get a larger standard deduction, while tips and overtime pay are exempted from income taxes. The provisions include limits to shrink their cost and expire after 2028.

Parents

The maximum child tax credit increases by an additional $200 from $2,000 starting in tax year 2025 and is permanently indexed to inflation. Parents could open up new “Trump accounts” for their babies seeded with $1,000 from the government for children born from 2025 through 2028.

Telecommunications

The bill auctions off a massive amount of radio spectrum for use in wireless broadband, a potential boon for services like SpaceX’s Starlink and 5G and future 6G mobile networks.

Corporations

Other tax increases that had been considered that would have hit big business, such as an increase in the stock buyback tax or a limit on the state and local deduction for corporations, were mostly rejected.

Defense contractors

The package boosts defense spending by $150 billion, with much of the funding going to new weapons systems made by major contractors.

Space

The bill provides nearly $10 billion to fund projects including efforts to reach the Moon and Mars and eventually decommission the international space station.

Losers

Low-income Americans

Some of the costs for the tax bill are defrayed through cuts to Medicaid health coverage and food stamps, both of which benefit low-income Americans. On average, the legislation will cost the bottom 20% of taxpayers $560 a year, according to a Yale Budget Lab analysis.

The measure creates new work requirements for Medicaid recipients, unless they are elderly, disabled or have children under 14 years old. Medicaid beneficiaries who gained eligibility through the Affordable Care Act will have to pay a share of costs through charges like co-pays.

Food assistance for low-income Americans is cut by expanding existing work requirements for federal food stamps to cover beneficiaries up to 65 years old. Beginning in 2028, states also are required to pay a portion of food benefit costs, which are now fully paid by the federal government.

Renewable energy

Clean energy industries are hit by the Republican plan, which rolls back many provisions of former President Joe Biden’s landmark climate law.

A tax credit for solar panels and wind systems is quickly phased out, though the legislation takes more time to eliminate other clean electricity production and investment credits.

Tax credits for energy efficiency home improvements and residential installation of solar or other clean energy upgrades are eliminated at the end of the year.

Technology companies

The Senate squelched a controversial effort in the bill to prevent U.S. states from regulating artificial intelligence, delivering a win for tech industry critics and a blow to the likes of Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc., as well as venture capital firms like Andreessen Horowitz.

Trump administration officials and GOP allies in Silicon Valley had pushed the measure saying it would prevent a patchwork of cumbersome state-by-state regulations.

Electric vehicle makers

Tesla Inc., General Motors Co. and other electric vehicle makers are hit by elimination of a consumer tax credit of up to $7,500 for the purchase of electric vehicles.

Elite universities

Add tax bills to the escalating battle the Trump administration is waging against elite universities such as Harvard and Columbia.

The current 1.4% tax on net investment income of private college and university endowments ratchets up for better-funded institutions. The new tiered tax rate structure climbs as high as 8% for colleges with the most endowment income per student.

Immigrants

Several provisions raise taxes on immigrants. That includes a new 1% tax on transfers of money to foreign countries, known as remittances. Many immigrants in the U.S. send money to relatives in their countries of origin.

The proposal also restricts some immigrants’ access to tax credits for health coverage premiums. The change prevents many immigrants granted asylum or temporary protected status from accessing those credits.

Gamblers

Gamblers would only be able to deduct 90% of their losses against their winnings, leading to a situation where they could still owe income tax if they break even over a year or lose money overall.

The White House has said former President Joe Biden’s initiative “promised much but delivered nothing.” However, the tax credits helped fuel an EV market far more robust and affordable than drivers enjoyed before the rebates kicked in two and a half years ago. Repealing them, along with a flurry of other anti-EV policies put in place or being pursued by the Trump administration, will put a serious dent in sales.

US adoption is set to trail the global average through 2040 and will knock the nation out of the top three EV markets, according to a recent BloombergNEF report. Last year’s version of the report had the country boasting higher-than-average sales starting in 2029.

Still, Elaine Buckberg, a former General Motors economist now at Harvard University’s Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability, estimates that even with federal tax cuts disappearing, some 37% of new cars bought in 2030 will be electric. That’s down from a forecast of 48% if the current incentives remained. The factors propping up some of the demand are fairly straightforward: Electric cars are far better and cheaper than they used to be, and there are many more models to choose from.

“In the most likely scenario, you end up about two years behind on adoption,” Buckberg said. ”I think [EVs] will be more resilient than people are thinking.”

The average price US drivers pay for an EV has ticked slightly lower in the IRA era, from $64,700 in January 2023 to $59,900 in April, a 7.4% decline without adjusting for inflation, according to Edmunds.com. However, the range of options has widened dramatically.

When the IRA was passed, there were 34 types of EVs for sale in the US, with just 11 models below the average vehicle price of $47,500. Today, there are twice as many electric models to choose from, and 19 have below-average sticker prices. EV incentives in 17 states can bring the cost down even further for some buyers.

“You just have more non-luxury offerings,” Buckberg said. “You’re more likely to find the brand you want, the style you want, the size you want.”

Stephanie Valdez Streaty, a director at Cox Automotive, said carmakers and dealers are offering discounts that are often as generous or more so than government incentives. Dealer incentives on a Nissan Leaf, she said, mean “you can get that vehicle for less than $20,000” in some cases.

BNEF expects US EVs will be as cheap or cheaper than gas-powered iterations by roughly 2028 (Goldman Sachs estimates that rubicon could be crossed even sooner).

There's evidence that a majority of Americans are at least electric-curious. Nearly 60% of US vehicle shoppers are “very” or “somewhat” likely to purchase an EV, according to a May JD Power survey — levels unchanged from a year ago. What's more, concerns about purchase price and cost of ownership have declined over the past 12 months.

Still, the loss of federal incentives will hit the lower end of the market particularly hard. “The people who have the means to go buy a Rivian or a Lucid are still going to go do that,” said Ingrid Malmgren, the senior policy director at advocacy group Plug In America. “The impact, like so much of the rest of this bill, is inordinately going to be paid for by lower-income Americans.”

Rolling back EV tax credits is also only part of how the Trump administration is favoring internal combustion models. It has frozen a $5 billion federal plan to build charging stations, primarily along rural interstate corridors and in low-income communities. The White House has also promised to lower regulations on tailpipe emissions and moved to block a California policy to ban gasoline-powered car sales by 2035.

Factoring in all of these policy shifts will slow EVs’ momentum even further than the IRA cuts: BNEF forecasts that just 27% of the US market to be electric by 2030, down from the 48% share it estimated a year ago, and Buckberg expects a similar slowdown.

Outside the US, however, EVs remain on a tear thanks to a drop in battery prices and a wave of low-price models rolling out of Chinese factories. BNEF expects one in four new cars sold this year — some 22 million cars and trucks — to come with a plug, a 25% increase over 2024. Two-thirds of those sales will be in China.",https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2025/07/20250705044203_trump-bbb.jpg,N,,2025-07-05 07:03:30.368183

Update: The President of the United States has signed into law the budget reconciliation bill (H.R. 1, the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"") on July 4, 2025.

Update: The House of Representatives passed (by a vote of 218-214) the budget reconciliation bill on July 3, 2025.

On July 1, 2025, the Senate passed (by a vote of 51-50) its version of the budget reconciliation bill containing numerous tax reform provisions. Below are our summaries of the proposed amendments to certain tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (""IRA"") as well as our initial observations.

The focus of the updates in the bill are as follows:

Special rules would apply to wind and solar, including (i) a placed in service deadline of Dec. 31, 2027, for facilities beginning construction after 1 year from enactment, (ii) removal of ""energy property"" under section 48 from 5-year MACRS depreciation, and (iii) amendments to the applicable domestic content percentages under section 48E;

Enhanced foreign entity of concern (FEOC) restrictions, including (i) application of the ""material assistance"" rules to wind and solar facilities beginning construction after Dec. 31, 2025, (ii) extending the period for assessment to 6 years for a deficiency attributable to an error in the determination of ""material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity"", and (iii) introducing accuracy-related penalties for understatements of income tax by more than 1% due to overstating the ""material assistance cost ratio"" of property qualifying for credits under sections 45X, 45Y, or 48E;

Codification of the beginning of construction rules in IRS Notices 2013-29 and 2018-59 (as well as any subsequently issued guidance clarifying, modifying, or updating either Notice), as in effect on Jan. 1, 2025, for purposes of the FEOC requirements;

""Metallurgical coal"" would be eligible for the advanced manufacturing production credit under section 45X in tax years beginning after enactment and until Dec. 31, 2029; and

Clean hydrogen production facilities beginning construction before Jan. 1, 2028, would remain eligible for credits under section 45V, with no applicable FEOC requirements.

Section Penalty Description Penalty Amount Sec. 666216

Substantial understatement of income tax due to disallowance of applicable energy credits:

Stricter penalty threshold when the IRS disallows a taxpayer's claimed energy credit (e.g., 45X, 45Y, or 48E) due to foreign entity restrictions or material assistance violations

A 1% misstatement of the tax liability would trigger a 20% penalty

Applies to credits disallowed due to FEOC or foreign-sourcing restrictions

Sec. 6695B

Substantial misstatements on certifications provided by suppliers:

New proposed penalty that targets suppliers or manufacturers who issue false certifications regarding domestic content or foreign sourcing

Applies to certifications provided after Dec. 31, 2025

Greater of $5,000 or 10% of credit amount claimed by the taxpayer relying on the misstated certification

Observation: Projects seeking tax credits under sections 45 and 48 are generally unaffected by the bill, except as described below with respect to the termination of 2% energy credit. To be eligible for tax credits under sections 45 or 48, a project (except for ground or groundwater thermal systems, as described below) must have begun construction before Jan. 1, 2025, and generally be placed in service within 4 years (or 10 years in the case of offshore wind) after in year in which construction begun.

§168 – Accelerated Cost Recovery System (Depreciation)

Section 45Y and 48E property would continue to be listed as 5-year MACRS property under section 168.

Property that would be ""energy property"" as defined in section 48 would no longer be listed as 5-year MACRS property under Section 168.

Observation: Without a specific indication to the contrary, there are arguments that such property would continue to be subject to the MACRS rules/guidance, which include general rules regarding the determination of MACRS class lives (such as Rev. Proc. 87-56).

Alternatively, taxpayers would appear to be able to elect the alternative depreciation system and apply 12-year, straight-line recovery under section 168(g).

45Y – Clean Electricity Production Credit & §48E – Clean Electricity Investment Credit

Placed in Service Deadline for Wind and Solar: Credits would terminate for wind and solar facilities that begin construction after 1 year from enactment and are not placed in service before Jan. 1, 2028—facilities that begin construction within 1 year from enactment would not be subject to the placed in service deadline.

Phase-Out for other technologies: All technology other than wind and solar would phase out after 2032 as follows:

100% credit for facilities beginning construction during 2033;

75% credit for facilities beginning construction during 2034;

50% credit for facilities beginning construction during 2035; and

0% credit for facilities beginning construction after Dec. 31, 2035.

Observation: The version of the bill that initially passed the House included deadlines based on beginning construction (within 60 days of enactment) and being placed in service (by Dec. 31, 2028). The Senate Finance Committee's version of the bill included a modified phaseout for wind and solar based on beginning construction by Dec. 31, 2027, however that proposal was then replaced with a placed in service deadline of Dec. 31, 2027 for projects beginning construction one year after enactment.

Observation: The accelerated timeline for wind and solar projects to be placed in service (as compared to the phase out for other technologies) presents additional challenges for developers faced with construction and supply uncertainty and potential inability to control the timing for when their facilities can be placed in service.

FEOC restrictions would disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" or a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (without regard to ""effective control"") for tax years beginning after enactment;

Taxpayers whose facilities are determined to be under ""effective control"" by a ""specified foreign entity"" in tax years beginning after enactment; and

Facilities that begin construction after Dec. 31, 2025, and include ""material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity"".

Observation: Requiring that ""effective control"" be ""determined"", in this context, implies that the determination will be made during post-filing examination and enforcement.

Special ITC Recapture Rule: 100% of ITCs claimed under section 48E with respect to a property would be recaptured if a ""specified taxpayer"" (i.e., one who is allowed an ITC for any tax year beginning 2 years after enactment) makes an ""applicable payment"" within 10 years after the property is placed in service.

Transferability would continue to be available for the duration of the credit period.

Special Rule for Residential Property: No credit would be allowed for residential solar water heating property or small wind energy property if the taxpayer/owner rents or leases such property to a third party.

Observation: Projects subject to PPAs and other property (such as battery storage projects) apparently would not be subject to the rule above.

Observation: Under the bill, residential solar electric property would not be subject to the rule above. Therefore, residential solar electric property leased to customers would still be eligible for section 45Y or 48E credits provided that other credit eligibility requirements are satisfied.

Observation: Residential projects that can demonstrate that they began construction in 2024 would qualify for the ITC under section 48.

Nuclear Energy Communities: Advanced nuclear facilities located in a metropolitan statistical area that has (or at any time after Dec. 31, 2009 has had) 0.17% of greater direct employment related to advanced nuclear power would be eligible for the energy community bonus credit amount for PTCs under section 45Y (but not for ITCs under section 48E).

Correction to Domestic Content Percentages Under 48E: The domestic content applicable percentage under 48E for qualified facilities and energy storage technology would be revised to match current 45Y as follows:

40% (or 20% for offshore wind) if construction begins before June 16, 2025;

45% (or 27.5% for offshore wind) if construction begins after June 16, 2025, and before Jan. 1, 2026;

50% (or 35% for offshore wind) if construction begins during 2026; and

55% if construction begins after Dec. 31, 2026.

Special Rules for Fuel Cell Property: For qualified fuel cell property that begins construction after Dec. 31, 2025, the credit rate would be fixed at 30% and could not be increased or otherwise adjusted, and the zero GHG emissions requirement and recapture rule for GHG emissions greater than 10 grams of C02e per KWh would not apply.

Observation: The fixed 30% ITC rate for fuel cell property suggests that PWA compliance would no longer be necessary to qualify for the full ITC rate, however the ITC rate could not be increased through bonus credit amounts for energy community or domestic content or otherwise.

§45Q – Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit

Parity of Credit Rate: For facilities placed in service after enactment, the credit amount would be the same regardless of whether the taxpayer merely disposed of the captured carbon oxide or undertakes use or utilization of the captured carbon oxide, as follows:

$17 ($36 for direct air capture) for tax years beginning in a calendar year after 2024 and before 2027 (indexed for 2025-inflation for any taxable year beginning in a calendar year after 2026)

FEOC restrictions would disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" or a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (without regard to ""effective control"") for tax years beginning after enactment.

§45U – Clean Electricity Production (For Existing Nuclear Facilities)

The credit would terminate for electricity produced and sold after Dec. 31, 2032.

FEOC restrictions would disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" for tax years beginning after enactment;

Taxpayers who are a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (without regard to ""effective control"") in tax years beginning 2 years after enactment; and

Transferability would continue to be available for the duration of the credit period.

§45V – Clean Hydrogen Production Credit

This credit would be terminated for facilities that begin construction after Dec. 31, 2027.

Observation: The FEOC restrictions apparently would not apply to section 45V.

§45X – Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit

Except as noted below, the credit rate would phase out under the current schedule based on the date the eligible components are sold:

Before Jan. 1, 2030: 100%;

During 2030: 75%;

During 2031: 50%;

During 2032: 25%;

After Dec. 31, 2032: 0%.

Wind energy components produced and sold after December 31, 2027, would not be credit eligible.

For critical minerals other than metallurgical coal, the credit rate would phase out as follows based on the date the critical minerals are produced:

Before Jan. 1, 2031: 100%;

During 2031: 75%;

During 2032: 50%;

During 2033: 25%;

After Dec. 31, 2033: 0%.

Inclusion of Metallurgical Coal as a Critical Mineral: Metallurgical coal that is suitable for use in the production of steel (within the meaning of the Department of Energy notice ""Critical Mineral List; Addition of Metallurgical Coal Used for Steelmaking"" (90 Fed. Reg. 22711 (May 29, 2025))) would be credit-eligible at a rate of 2.5% of the costs incurred by the taxpayer with respect to production, regardless of whether such production occurs inside or outside of the United States.

Metallurgical coal produced after Dec. 31, 2029, would not be credit eligible.

Observation: Under section 45X(d)(2) (not modified by the bill), sales are taken into account for section 45X credits only when production of eligible components is within the United States (or its possession). It remains to be seen whether this provision effectively requires the production of metallurgical coal to be within the United States to be credit-eligible.

FEOC restrictions would disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" or a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (without regard to ""effective control"") for tax years beginning after enactment;

Taxpayers who are determined to have produced eligible components through ""effective control"" by a ""specified foreign entity"" in tax years beginning after enactment; and

Eligible components produced in tax years beginning after enactment that include any ""material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity"".

Additional Requirement for Battery Modules: To be credit-eligible, battery modules would be required to be comprised of all other essential equipment needed for battery functionality, such as current collector assemblies and voltage sense harnesses, or any other essential energy collection equipment.

Sale of Integrated Components: For tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2026, sales of integrated components would remain credit-eligible only if the ""primary component"" is integrated, incorporated, or assembled into a ""secondary component"" (i) that is produced within the same manufacturing facility as the primary component, (ii) that is sold to an unrelated person, and (iii) for which not less than 65% of the total direct material costs are attributable to primary components which are mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States.

Observation: Taxpayers could still elect to treat a sale of components to a related person as being made to an unrelated person.

§45Z – Clean Fuel Production Credit

The credit period would be extended until Dec. 31, 2029 (based on when the fuel is sold).

Fuel produced after December 31, 2025, would be required to be exclusively derived from feedstock produced or grown in the United States, Mexico, or Canada.

Transportation fuel emissions rates published after Dec. 31, 2025, could not be less than zero.

Lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions would exclude any emissions attributed to indirect land use charge, and distinct emissions rates would be provided for transportation fuels derived from animal manure, including dairy, swine, and poultry.

Prevention of Double Credit: fuel produced from a fuel that generated a credit under section 45Z would not be credit eligible, and Treasury would be authorized to issue guidance on preventing the doubling of 45Z credits.

Sales to Unrelated Persons: Treasury would be authorized to prescribe rules for related persons whom the taxpayer has reason to believe will sell fuel to an unrelated person.

Special Rules for Sustainable Aviation Fuel:

For fuel sold or used on or after enactment (and fuel sold or used before enactment that have not yet been allowed or paid a credit under section 6426(k)), the sustainable aviation fuel credit under section 6426(k) would not be allowed for any gallon of fuel that could receive a credit under section 45Z.

For fuel produced after Dec. 31, 2025, the increased credit rate for SAF would not apply.

The sustainable aviation fuel credit under section 6426(k) would not apply to any sale or use for any period after September 30, 2025.

Small Agri-Biodiesel Producer Credit: For fuel sold or used after June 30, 2025:

The small agri-biodiesel producer credit under section 40A would be extended to sale or use on or before Dec. 31, 2026;

The credit amount would be increased from $0.10 to $0.20 per gallon of qualified agri-biodiesel production, and would be in addition to any credit determined under section 45Z with respect to such gallon of fuel;

The small agri-biodiesel producer credit could be transferred pursuant to section 6418; and

Eligible small agri-biodiesel producers would be required to be exclusively derived from feedstock produced or grown in the United States, Mexico, or Canada.

FEOC restrictions would disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" for tax years beginning after enactment; and

Taxpayers who are a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (without regard to ""effective control"") for tax years beginning 2 years after enactment.

§48 – Energy Credit

The 2% energy credit would terminate for any energy property beginning construction after June 16, 2025.

Observation: For projects beginning construction on or after Jan. 1, 2025, only ground or groundwater thermal systems remain eligible for the 6% energy credit, because other energy property eligible for a 6% energy credit (including fuel cells, solar, geothermal, small wind property, waste energy recovery property, energy storage technology, biogas property, microgrid controllers, and combined heat and power property) converted to the ""tech-neutral"" ITC under section 48E.

§48C – Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Credit

Upon enactment, allocations revoked for failure to place the project in service within 2 years from the date of certification would not be restored to the total amount of allocations under the program.

§6418 – Transfer of Certain Credits

The bill does not include a deadline with respect to the transfer of credits; however, transfers of credits under 45Q, 45U, 45X, 45Y, 45Z, or 48E to a ""specified foreign entity"" would be prohibited.

Observation: The preservation of transferability is undermined by the accelerated expiration of the credits themselves.

Observation: Additional FEOC requirements would apply to credits under sections 45Y,48E, and 45X that would not apply to credits under sections 45U, 45Q, 45Z, and 48.

FEOC Restrictions:

A ""prohibited foreign entity"" is either (i) a specified foreign entity or (ii) a foreign-influenced entity.

""Specified foreign entities"" include:

entities designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the Secretary of State;17

entities included on the specially designated nationals and blocked persons list maintained by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control;18

entities alleged by the Attorney General to have engaged in conduct for which a conviction was obtained under certain laws;

entities determined by the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the Director of National Intelligence, to be engaged in unauthorized conduct that is detrimental to U.S national security or foreign policy;19

Chinese military company operating in the United States;20

entities Listed Under the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act21; or

certain battery producing entities.22

Specified foreign entities include ""foreign controlled entities"" such as (i) the government of a covered nation (e.g., China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea), (ii) an agency or instrumentality of a government of a covered nation, (iii) a citizen or national of a covered nation without U.S. status as a citizen, national or lawful permanent resident, (iv) an entity organized under the laws of, or having its principal place of business in, a covered nation, or (v) an entity controlled by any of the above, including subsidiaries, measured by more than 50% ownership of stock in a corporation, profits interests or capital interests in a partnership, or other beneficial interest in the entity (under the section 318 attribution rules).

There would be an exception for publicly traded entities, except that (i) any exchange or market which is incorporated or organized under the laws of a covered nation or has its principal place of business in a covered nation is excluded from the definition of exchange or market for this purpose, and (ii) such entity shall still be deemed to be a foreign-controlled entity if 1 or more specified foreign entities or foreign-controlled entities controls more than 50%.

An entity is a ""foreign-influenced entity"" if:

(i) During the taxable year:

A specified foreign entity has direct or indirect authority to appoint a board member, executive officer, or similar individual;

A single specified foreign entity owns at least 25% of the entity;

One or more specified foreign entities own in the aggregate at least 40% of the entity; or

At least 15% of the entity's debt is held in the aggregate by one or more specified foreign entities; or

(ii) During the prior taxable year, the entity made an ""applicable payment"" to a specified foreign entity pursuant to a contract, agreement, or other arrangement which entitles the specified foreign entity (or a related entity) to exercise ""effective control"" over (i) any qualified facility or energy storage technology of the taxpayer (or any related person) or (ii) the extraction, processing, or recycling of any applicable critical mineral or production of an eligible component by the taxpayer (or any related person):

""Effective control"" generally would mean 1 or more agreements or arrangements which provide 1 or more contractual counterparties (or related person) of a taxpayer with specific authority over key aspects of the production of eligible components, energy generation, or energy storage which are not included in the measures of control through authority, ownership, or debt held.

Until FEOC guidance is issued, ""effective control"" would mean the unrestricted contractual right of a contractual counterparty to make certain major decisions for the taxpayer (including any related party to the taxpayer), such as (i) determine the quantity or timing of production of an eligible components, (ii) determine the amount or timing of activities related to the production of electricity or the storage or electrical energy, (iii) determine which entity may purchase or use the output of a production unit, (iv) determine which entity may purchase or use the output of a qualified facility, (v) restrict access to data critical to production or storage of energy, or to the site of production or any part of a qualified facility or energy storage technology of the taxpayer, to the personnel or agents of such contractual counterparty, or (vi) on an exclusive basis, maintain, repair, or operate any plant or equipment which is necessary to the production of eligible components or electricity.

With respect to a licensing agreement entered into with a contractual counterparty (or related person), ""effective control"" would also mean a contractual right to (i) specify or otherwise direct 1 or more sources of components, subcomponents, or applicable critical minerals, (ii) direct the operation, (iii) limit the taxpayer's utilization of intellectual property, (iv) receive royalties under the licensing agreement or any similar arrangement (or payments under any related agreement) beyond the 10th year of the agreement (including modifications or extensions), (v) direct or otherwise require the taxpayer (or any related party) to enter into an agreement for the provision of services for a duration longer than 2 years (including any modifications or extensions), or the contract, agreement, or other arrangement (vi) does not provide the licensee with all the technical data, information, and know-how necessary to enable the licensee to produce the eligible component or components subject to the contract, agreement, or other arrangement without further involvement from the contractual counterparty (or related person) or a specified foreign entity, or (vii) was entered into (or modified) on or after the date of enactment.

There would be an exception for a bona fide purchase or sale of intellectual property. However, a bona fide purchase or sale would not include any purchase or sale of intellectual property where the agreement provides that ownership of the intellectual property reverts to the contractual counterparty after a period of time.

There would be an exception for publicly traded entities, except such entity shall still be deemed to be a foreign-influenced entity if (i) a specified foreign entity has the authority to appoint a covered officer, (ii) a single specified foreign entity owns not less than 25% of the publicly traded entity, (iii) 1 or more specified foreign entities own in the aggregate not less than 40% of the publicly traded entity, or (iv) debt in excess of 15% of the publicly traded debt of the publicly traded entity has been issued to 1 or more specified foreign entities.

Whether construction or production of any property includes ""material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity"" would be determined based on whether the ""material assistance cost ratio"" is less than the ""threshold percentage"".

Threshold percentages:

For any qualified facility under sections 45Y or 48E, the threshold percentage would be:

40% if construction begins in 2026;

45% if construction begins in 2027;

50% if construction begins in 2028;

55% if construction begins in 2029; and

60% if construction begins after Dec. 31, 2029.

For energy storage technology under section 48E, the threshold percentage would be:

55% if construction begins in 2026;

60% if construction begins in 2027;

65% if construction begins in 2028;

70% if construction begins in 2029; and

75% if construction begins in after Dec. 31, 2029.

For solar energy components:

50% if sold during 2026;

60% if sold during 2027;

70% if sold during 2028;

80% if sold during 2029; and

85% if sold after Dec. 31, 2029.

For wind energy components:

85% if sold during 2026; and

90% if sold during 2027.

For inverters:

50% if sold during 2026;

55% if sold during 2027;

60% if sold during 2028;

65% if sold during 2029; and

70% if sold after Dec. 31, 2029.

For qualifying battery components:

60% if sold during 2026;

65% if sold during 2027;

70% if sold during 2028;

80% if sold during 2029; and

85% if sold after Dec. 31, 2029.

For applicable critical minerals:

0% if sold after Dec. 31, 2025 and before Jan. 1, 2030;

25% if sold during 2030;

30% if sold during 2031;

40% if sold during 2032; and

50% if sold after Dec. 31, 2032.

Observation: For purposes of the FEOC requirements, the bill would codify that ""beginning of construction"" for tax purposes is determined pursuant to rules under IRS Notices 2013-29 and 2018-59 (as well as any subsequently issued guidance clarifying, modifying, or updating either Notice), as in effect on Jan. 1, 2025.

Observation: Treasury would be required to issue guidance not later than Dec. 31, 2027 applying new threshold percentages for critical minerals equaling or exceeding these amounts, taking into account domestic geographic availability, supply chain constraints, domestic processing capacity needs, and national security concerns.

Material assistance cost ratios:

For any qualified facility or energy storage technology, the material assistance cost ratio is the ratio of (i) the total costs of all manufactured products incorporated into the qualified facility or energy storage technology upon completion of construction minus such costs that are mined, produced, or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity, divided by (ii) the total costs of all manufactured products incorporated into the qualified facility or energy storage technology upon completion of construction.

""Manufactured product"" has the same meaning as provided in domestic content guidance.

For any product line that produces eligible components, the material assistance cost ratio is the ratio of (i) the total direct materials costs that are paid or incurred for production of such eligible components minus such costs that are mined, produced, or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity, divided by (ii) the total direct materials costs that are paid or incurred for production of such eligible components.

Safe harbor tables: Not later than Dec. 31, 2026, Treasury would be required to issue safe harbor tables. Until then, and for qualified facilities that begin construction within 60 days after the issuance of such tables, a taxpayer may (i) use the tables provided in the domestic content safe harbor guidance (IRS Notice 2025-08) to establish the total direct material cost of any listed eligible component or manufactured product and (ii) rely on a certification by the supplier that the manufactured product, eligible component, constituent element, material, or subcomponent was not produced or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity.

Certification requirement: The certification from the supplier would be required to (i) include the supplier's EIN, (ii) be signed under penalty of perjury, (iii) be retained by the supplier for not less than 6 years and be provided to the IRS upon request, and (iv) state either (1) that such property was not produced or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity and that the supplier does not know (or have reason to know) that any prior supplier in the chain of production of that property is a prohibited foreign entity, or (2) the total direct material cost for each product or component that were not produced or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity.

If a taxpayer knows or has reason to know that a manufactured product or eligible component was produced or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity, then the taxpayer must treat all direct material costs with respect to such product or component as mined, produced, or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity and may not rely on a certification from the supplier.

Binding written contract exception: Upon the election of the taxpayer (in form and manner to be designated by Treasury), any manufactured product, eligible component, or constituent element, material, or subcomponent acquired by the taxpayer pursuant to a binding written contract entered into before June 16, 2025, and placed in service before Jan. 1, 2030 (January 1, 2028 in the case of solar and wind property used to generate electricity) in a facility that began construction before August 1, 2025, would not be included for purposes of determining the material assistance cost ratio.

Observation: The imposition of FEOC rules to tax credit qualification would introduce an additional layer of complexity. The statute would further authorize the Treasury Department to issue regulations under these rules, including establishing rules to prevent evasion, circumvention, or abuse of the rules through (i) impermissible technology licensing arrangements with specified foreign entities, (ii) abuse of the binding written contract exception through stockpiling of any manufactured product, eligible component, or constituent material, or subcomponent during any period prior to application of the rules, or where the facts and circumstances demonstrate that the beginning of construction of a qualified facility or energy storage technology has not in fact occurred.

Extended assessment period: Any deficiency attributable to an error in the determination of material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity could be assessed within 6 years after the return for such year was filed.

Accuracy-related penalty: If there is a ""disallowance of an applicable energy credit"", then the substantial understatement of income tax penalty would apply to understatements of income tax by more than 1% of the tax required to be shown on the return.

A ""disallowance of an applicable energy credit"" would be disallowance of a credit under sections 45X, 45Y, or 48E by reason of overstating the material assistance cost ratio.

For an entity claiming direct pay under section 6417, a ""disallowance of an applicable energy credit"" would cause an ""excessive payment"" and incur the 20% penalty on the amount of the excessive payment (unless the taxpayer shows reasonable cause).

Penalty for false certification of supplier: If an inaccurate or false certification by a supplier results in the ""disallowance of an applicable energy credit"" and the understatement of income tax exceeds the lesser of (i) 5% of the tax required to be shown on the return or (ii) $100,000, then the person making the certification would be required to pay a penalty equal to the greater of (a) 10% of the amount of the underpayment attributable to the inaccuracy or falsity or (b) $5,000 (unless the person shows reasonable cause).

The argument some people have made is that the used EV tax credit just raises used EV prices by $4,000.
The argument is that people are only going to pay what they can pay on the used EV market, so if they can afford a $12,000 car, they can buy a $12,000 car with no tax credit or they can buy a $16,000 car with a $4,000 tax credit.
Do you think that used EV prices will effectively drop by $4,000 on October 1 or so?

As noted earlier today, Republicans in Congress decided to end all EV tax credits on September 30, 2025. That includes the $4,000 tax credit for used electric cars. In theory, when you buy a used electric car, it’s effectively $4,000 cheaper due to the tax credit.

The argument some people have made is that the used EV tax credit just raises used EV prices by $4,000. The argument is that people are only going to pay what they can pay on the used EV market, so if they can afford a $12,000 car, they can buy a $12,000 car with no tax credit or they can buy a $16,000 car with a $4,000 tax credit. Therefore, with no tax credit, used car sellers will just sell EVs for $4,000 less.

Before getting to ramifications of that if it’s true, I wanted to poll you readers to see what you thought of this. Do you think that used EV prices will effectively drop by $4,000 on October 1 or so? Or do you think they won’t drop that much, if at all? The poll embedded below (linked above) is just one short question. Just be sure to click “Done” after answering the question.

If used car prices do drop — whether by $4,000 or $3,000 or $2,000 — remember that there is of course another side to such a transaction. There’s the seller’s side. If the tax credit was a ruse and didn’t actually do anything to help used electric car buyers, it certainly must have helped people selling their EVs — normally to buy another one. When the resale value of their car is thousands of dollars less than it would have been, they are either going to lose more money or they are just going to hold off and not sell their EV, and not buy a new one.

This might be even worse, because this will significantly hurt the electric car market overall — and will also thus lead to fewer used electric cars down the road for second-hand buyers. Yikes.

Anyway, I look forward to finding out what you all think about this topic, and will report back the poll results in a few days or so.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Tesla-Model-3-BMW-i3-Zach-Shahan-CleanTechnica-1-e1751688626459.jpg,N,,2025-07-05 06:03:14.755438

News. News Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest 2025 Prize Money: How much could the winner take home?

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, promoted by Donald Trump's administration, is an ambitious legislative proposal that seeks to extend the tax cuts of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, tighten requirements for social programs and prioritize spending on defense and immigration control

Although it has not yet been approved by Congress and could be modified, this project clearly reflects the Republican economic agenda for the immediate future.

What does the Big Beautiful Bill propose?

Extension of 2017 tax cuts: It extends the benefits of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including corporate tax cuts. However, several of these measures will expire in 2025 if not renewed permanently.

SALT Cap: Raises the state and local tax deduction from $10,000 to $40,000 between 2025 and 2029, with an annual increase of 1%. In 2030, it will revert to $10,000.

Medicaid and SNAP cuts: Introduces work requirements for healthy adults with children over the age of 15 (minimum 80 hours per month of work or volunteering) and reduces funding over a period of 10 years. According to the CBO, this could leave more than 10 million people without health insurance.

Funding for defense and immigration: It allocates $46.5 billion for border wall construction, more than $100 billion for ICE and increases defense funding.

Elimination of green incentives: It removes Inflation Reduction Act tax credits for electric vehicles and home energy improvements, which will make the transition to renewables more expensive, affecting consumers and the automotive industry, which could see lower demand for sustainable vehicles.

Tax exemption on tips: Eliminates federal income taxes on tips for workers with gross incomes below $150,000 a year (or $300,000 for joint filers), with a deduction cap of $25,000. This measure is temporary, in effect until the end of 2028, and tips will still be subject to payroll taxes.

Key tax changes for taxpayers

Standard deduction: Increases from $15,000 to $15,750 for single filers and from $30,000 to $31,500 for joint returns in 2025, indexed to inflation.

Inheritance and gift tax exemption: Rises from $13.99 million to $15 million for singles and from $27.98 million to $30 million for couples in 2026.

Child Tax Credit: Increases from $2,000 to $2,200 per child, with a refund of $1,700 in 2025, adjusted for inflation in later years.

SALT deduction limit: As mentioned, it rises to $40,000 in 2025, with annual increases until 2029.

Who benefits and who pays?

High- and middle-income taxpayers will benefit from tax cuts and the increase in the SALT limit. However, cuts to Medicaid and SNAP could reduce access to health insurance and food assistance for millions of low-income families. The elimination of green incentives will also make energy and electric vehicle costs more expensive, affecting consumers and businesses committed to sustainability.

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that the bill will increase the federal deficit by $2.4 trillion over a decade, although some experts, according to the BBC, warn that it could reach $5 trillion if the measures are extended without compensatory measures. In addition, the tightening of requirements for Medicaid, which requires healthy adults to work or volunteer, could limit access to health care for vulnerable populations, especially in rural communities.

Political and economic impact

The project reflects Trump's Republican agenda, focused on economic growth and immigration control, but faces opposition from Democrats and social organizations, who warn of the dismantling of essential programs. The debate in Congress promises to be intense, with sharp divisions between those who support tax relief for businesses and higher-income taxpayers and those who defend the protection of social programs.

What does it mean for your economy?

If you live in a middle- or upper-class area, tax cuts and the high SALT deduction could reduce your tax burden. However, for low-income families, cuts to Medicaid and SNAP pose a direct threat. The elimination of green incentives could also raise the cost of energy and sustainable transportation, affecting purchasing decisions and financial planning.

In summary, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is a package of measures with two sides: tax relief for some, but at the expense of social programs and an increase in the deficit. As Congress deliberates, the debate over who will pay the final price is far from resolved.",https://phantom-marca.uecdn.es/98cd444392147d1a605208591f60d2de/resize/1200/f/webp/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2025/07/04/17516449942122.jpg,N,,2025-07-05 04:00:02.370893

Investors must now grapple with a landscape where geopolitical catalysts—from halted Patriot missile shipments to Russian retaliation—are reshaping supply chains and pricing dynamics. This article explores how sanctions-driven risks are creating opportunities in North American energy producers, alternative energy plays, and commodities like gold, while warning of persistent volatility.

The Sanctions Cascade: Disrupting Russian Energy Supply Chains

U.S. sanctions targeting Russia's energy sector have reached unprecedented scale. By designating major producers like Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas, along with over 180 “shadow fleet” vessels and insurance providers, Washington has severed critical arteries of Russia's oil exports. The Treasury's prohibition on U.S. petroleum services under Executive Order 14071 further undermines Russia's ability to extract and refine oil. These measures, complemented by the EU's $45/barrel oil price cap, have already reduced Gazprom's stock by 40% since late 2022.

The operational fallout is stark. Asia's commodity inspection giant, CCIC Singapore, recently laid off hundreds amid sanctions for facilitating Iranian oil shipments—a stark example of how secondary sanctions are destabilizing Russia's supply networks. Meanwhile, the narrowing of General License 8L until March 2025 has forced global buyers to abandon Russian energy contracts, accelerating supply chain fragmentation.

Geopolitical Catalysts: From Patriot Pauses to Russian Retaliation

While the Pentagon's July 2025 decision to halt Patriot missile shipments to Ukraine primarily impacts military logistics, it underscores broader U.S. strategic retrenchment. This pause, driven by defense production bottlenecks, risks emboldening Russian aggression. Moscow's recent drone assaults on Kyiv—part of a broader strategy to destabilize Ukraine—threaten to escalate into direct supply chain disruptions (e.g., gas pipeline sabotage).

Equally critical is Russia's potential retaliation against European energy markets. Europe remains vulnerable to gas supply cuts, as seen in 2022, which could trigger a surge in liquefied natural gas (LNG) demand from North American producers. Investors should monitor Russian rhetoric and actions closely; any escalation could amplify oil price volatility.

Positioning for Volatility: Key Sectors and Stocks

North American Energy Producers

The U.S. and Canada are prime beneficiaries of reduced Russian supply. With Brent crude hovering near $85/barrel (up 15% year-to-date), majors like ExxonMobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) are poised to capitalize on higher prices and stable regulatory environments. Smaller players such as EOG Resources (EOG), focused on shale oil, offer leveraged exposure to price rises.

Alternative Energy Plays

Sanctions-driven energy insecurity is accelerating the transition to renewables. Utilities like NextEra Energy (NEE), a leader in wind and solar, and First Solar (FSLR), a top photovoltaic panel maker, benefit from long-term demand for energy independence. Investors should also consider Enphase Energy (ENPH), a solar inverter specialist, as distributed energy systems gain traction.

Gold as a Geopolitical Hedge

Gold's safe-haven appeal has surged amid geopolitical uncertainty. With Russian-U.S. tensions mirroring Cold War dynamics, investors are flocking to physical gold ETFs like GLD and miners such as Newmont (NEM). Historically, gold prices rise by 8% annually during periods of elevated geopolitical risk—a trend likely to continue.

Risks and Considerations

While the sanctions regime is robust, risks persist. Russia's partnership with North Korea highlights evasion tactics, such as illicit oil trading and technology swaps, which could dilute sanctions' effectiveness. Additionally, U.S. defense production bottlenecks—exemplified by the Patriot missile pause—could limit military support for Ukraine, prolonging the conflict and its economic toll.

Investors must also weigh the Federal Reserve's stance. A rate hike in late 2025 could dampen energy demand and equity valuations. Diversification across energy equities, commodities, and defensive sectors remains prudent.

Conclusion: A Volatile Landscape Demands Prudence and Agility

The U.S.-Russia conflict has transformed energy markets into a geopolitical battleground. Sanctions are dismantling Russia's energy dominance, but the path to stability is fraught with risks. Investors should prioritize North American energy producers for price-driven gains, alternative energy for long-term resilience, and gold as a hedge against volatility. As tensions evolve, staying attuned to geopolitical catalysts—from military pauses to supply chain disruptions—will be key to navigating this turbulent landscape.",,N,,2025-07-05 03:05:23.784906

The megabill's subsidy cuts and Musk's political brinkmanship create near-term headwinds, but Tesla's technological edge and market share remain unmatched.","The Tesla saga continues to unfold in a high-stakes dance between innovation, politics, and policy. As President Trump's “megabill” dismantles clean energy subsidies and Elon Musk's public feud with the administration escalates, investors face a critical question: Is Tesla's volatility a signal to sell—or a buying opportunity in the making?

The Megabill's Double-Edged Sword

The megabill, set to take effect in late 2025, eliminates the $7,500 federal tax credit for new EVs and the $4,000 credit for used EVs—a lifeline for Tesla and competitors alike. These credits, part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, were designed to accelerate EV adoption. Their removal will hit Tesla hardest, as its premium vehicles depend on subsidies to stay competitive with cheaper rivals like BYD. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill will add $3 trillion to the national debt over a decade, primarily from tax cuts for corporations and high earners—a stark contrast to the modest savings from killing EV incentives.

The immediate market reaction? Tesla's stock plummeted 6% in late 2024 when the bill was proposed, and another 3% in June 2025 after Musk accused it of “killing jobs” on his social media platform. Yet, paradoxically, Tesla's shares rallied 9% in the following weeks as investors bet on Musk's counterpunch: autonomous driving advancements, cost-cutting, and a planned robotaxi launch.

Musk's Political Gambit: Signal or Noise?

Musk's feud with Trump—sparking threats of a new political party and mocking the administration's “Department of Government Efficiency”—is more than theater. It signals Tesla's strategic pivot: lobbying for autonomy in a regulatory environment that's turned hostile. The megabill's attack on subsidies forces Tesla to prove it can thrive without them. Musk's defiance may be a bid to rally investors and customers, but it also risks inviting scrutiny of Tesla's past subsidies and immigration ties.

The stakes are existential. If the megabill's cuts to solar and energy storage tax credits stick, Tesla's Energy division—a $50 billion revenue opportunity by 2030—could stall. Yet, Tesla's Q2 2025 results show resilience: production hit 410,244 vehicles, matching 2024's record, and energy storage deployments stayed steady at 9.6 GWh. The market is pricing in Musk's vision, not just his volatility.

Navigating the Crossroads: Risks and Opportunities

Short-Term Risks:

- Subsidy Loss: Competitors like GM and Rivian will retain eligibility for EV credits until 2027, giving them a pricing edge. Tesla's Model 3/Y sales could decline 19–25% annually without subsidies.

- Debt and Rates: The megabill's $3 trillion debt surge could force higher interest rates, squeezing Tesla's growth and valuation. Its $9.57 billion debt load makes it vulnerable.

- Political Overreach: Musk's taunts with Trump risk regulatory retaliation, from audits of subsidies to trade restrictions on China-sourced batteries.

Long-Term Opportunities:

- Autonomy Monetization: Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) software, now with a 25% subscription take rate, could generate $1 trillion in revenue by 2030 if scaled globally.

- Cost Discipline: Musk's 10% workforce cuts and $5,000 price cuts for some models signal a shift toward affordability. Without subsidies, Tesla must lead on margins—or cede ground to BYD.

- Energy Storage Dominance: Despite tax credit losses, Tesla's energy division has a first-mover advantage in grid-scale batteries, a $200 billion market by 2030.

The Investment Thesis: Buy the Dips, but Hedge the Risks

Tesla's stock is a rollercoaster, but its volatility offers contrarian opportunities:

Short-Term Play:

Sell on Musk's Rhetoric: Dip into puts when Musk's Twitter storms push the stock below $220—his feud with Trump often precedes short-term dips.

Buy on Megabill Fears: The stock's 14% drop in June 2024 after the bill's announcement was overdone. A similar reaction in late 2025 could be a buying opportunity if the bill's final version softens on subsidies.

Long-Term Hold:

Target $300+ by 2026: Tesla's $1 trillion market cap hinges on autonomy and energy storage. Accumulate shares below $250, using straddle options (calls and puts) to hedge against volatility.

Monitor Execution: Tesla must deliver on robotaxis by late 2025 and cut production costs by 50%—milestones that could justify a valuation rebound.

Conclusion: Tesla's Fate Hangs in the Balance

Tesla's volatility is a symptom of its ambition—and its vulnerabilities. The megabill's subsidy cuts and Musk's political brinkmanship create near-term headwinds, but Tesla's technological edge and market share remain unmatched. For investors, the key is to separate Musk's theatrics from the fundamentals: Can Tesla thrive without subsidies? Will autonomous driving and energy storage justify its $1 trillion valuation?

The answer may lie in the next 12 months. A robotaxi launch that wows investors, a Q3 delivery rebound above 450,000 units, and bipartisan amendments to the megabill's harshest provisions could turn Tesla's volatility into a buying signal. Until then, the stock remains a high-risk, high-reward bet on Musk's vision—and America's energy future.

Investment Takeaway:

- Aggressive Traders: Use straddles ahead of Robotaxi Day (Q4 2025) to profit from volatility.

- Core Investors: Buy dips below $220, targeting $300+ by end-2026.

- Avoid: Overexposure without hedging—regulatory and geopolitical risks remain too high.

(WOWK) – The West Virginia Coal Association is praising the passage of the massive budget bill passed by Congress on Thursday, however, not every coal mining organization is on board.

The controversial bill made its second round through the House of Representatives with a vote of 218-214, which President Donald Trump is expected to sign Friday evening. All Democrats and two Republicans voted against the bill.

The West Virginia Coal Association says the passage marks an “important step toward restoring balance and accountability in American energy policy.” The organization applauded the Trump administration, as well as West Virginia’s Congressional delegation, all four of whom voted in favor of the bill, also called the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”

“For years, the coal industry has been burdened by excessive regulation and uncertainty. The OBBB helps reverse that trend by implementing reforms that ease permitting, improve access to federal lands, and eliminate policies that placed domestic producers at a disadvantage,” said Chris Hamilton, president of the WVCA.

The WVCA points out that the bill includes several changes they have sought to “level the playing field” in the energy sector, such as phased reduction of certain clean energy tax credits, phasing out electric vehicle and charging stations subsidies, a 10-year delay in methane emission fees, recognition of base load power generation’s importance in the nation’s electric grid, and incorporation of certain coals as critical minerals for advanced manufacturing.

“These provisions support a more balanced approach to energy development while reaffirming the importance of coal as a dependable source of affordable, baseload power. The legislation provides greater certainty for operators, workers, and communities that rely on a strong coal economy— particularly in West Virginia,” Hamilton said.

While the WVCA supports the bill, the United Mine Workers of America, however, spoke out against it prior to its passage. On June 27, the UMWA released a letter by UMWA International President Cecil E. Roberts, who is from West Virginia, calling the bill “dangerous.”

“This legislation isn’t just a bad idea, it’s a dangerous one,” said UMWA International President Cecil E. Roberts. “It strips resources from the very people who keep our country running; miners, veterans, public servants, and their families, just to give billionaires a bigger tax break. Cutting off health care access, closing Black Lung clinics, and turning our backs on working-class communities is not how we move forward as a nation.”

In the letter, Roberts shared concerns that rural America would be hit the hardest by the Medicaid cuts included in the legislation. He said this could lead to reduced care, including for black lung clinics that provide vital care to miners who have contracted the disease. You can read the full letter here.

Texas' 2024 State Flood Plan, which integrates regional input and prioritizes projects like the Ike Dike, is a step forward.","The catastrophic floods that ravaged Texas' Hill Country in July 2025—killing dozens and reducing entire communities to rubble—were not an isolated tragedy. They were a clarion call for America's crumbling infrastructure and a stark reminder of the escalating costs of climate inaction. With the Guadalupe River surging to its second-highest recorded level in mere hours, and 750 children stranded at Camp Mystic, the disaster underscored a brutal truth: the U.S. is catastrophically underprepared for the climate-driven disasters of the 21st century. For investors, this is both a warning and an opportunity.

The Cost of Complacency

Texas' floods are not anomalies. Since 2020, tropical cyclones like Hurricane Beryl (July 2024, $7.2B in damages) and Hurricane Francine (September 2024, $1.3B) have exposed the fragility of flood mitigation systems. The state's aging dams, underfunded levees, and outdated FEMA flood maps have proven inadequate against increasingly intense rainfall events. According to the Texas Water Development Board, over 500 dams require $1.5B in repairs—a fraction of the $54.5B needed to address regional flood plans.

The human and economic toll is staggering. The 2025 Hill Country floods alone caused over $10B in damages, while the 2017 Hurricane Harvey disaster cost $125B. Yet, federal disaster aid, already strained, is becoming harder to secure. Proposed reforms under Project 2025—such as raising FEMA's damage thresholds and introducing state deductibles—could further starve flood-prone regions of critical funds.

The Investment Case for Climate Resilience

The silver lining? The need for climate-resilient infrastructure is a multitrillion-dollar market. From “gray” solutions like the $31B Ike Dike coastal barrier to “green” investments in wetland restoration and nature-based drainage systems, the demand for flood mitigation is surging. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) are emerging as the only scalable model to fund these projects, blending private capital with government guarantees.

Consider Harris County's $2.5B bond program, which has already funded 200 projects, including bayou expansions and detention basins. Or the Wharton Flood Reduction Levee, a $200M effort that combined federal, state, and local funds. These projects are not just about saving lives—they're about preserving economic value. A single levee might cost $50M but prevent $500M in flood-related losses over its lifespan.

The Risk of Inaction

Investors who ignore climate resilience do so at their peril. Real estate portfolios in flood zones face plummeting valuations as insurers retreat. Companies in vulnerable areas—think energy, logistics, or tourism—will see rising operational risks. Meanwhile, the Texas Flood Registry reveals that post-Harvey mental health crises persist, with 91% of storm-related stress linked to recurring trauma.

The math is simple: underinvest now, and pay later. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that every $1 spent on mitigation saves $6 in disaster recovery. For equity investors, this translates to opportunities in:

Infrastructure Firms: Companies like AECOM (ACM) and Fluor (FLR), which specialize in flood control systems and coastal engineering.

Resilient Real Estate: REITs like Prologis (PLD) or Ventas (VTR) that prioritize flood-resistant properties.

Green Bonds: Municipal bonds funding projects like the Little Cypress Creek Frontier Program, which blend environmental and fiscal returns.

The Role of Policy and Innovation

Public-private partnerships require policy clarity. Texas' 2024 State Flood Plan, which integrates regional input and prioritizes projects like the Ike Dike, is a step forward. But without federal buy-in—such as reversing FEMA's cost-share cuts—the burden will fall disproportionately on cash-strapped states.

Investors should also watch for innovations in flood insurance and parametric risk solutions, which use real-time data (e.g., rainfall sensors) to trigger payouts instantly. Companies like Swiss Re (SREN) are pioneers here, but U.S. startups like Resilience Financial are emerging.

Final Verdict: Floodgates to Profit

As reported by the official website of the governor's office, the bill in question prescribes a phase-out of federal incentives for renewables like wind and solar by 2028, while concurrently bolstering subsidies for fossil fuels.

With a cold economic calculus, the legislation threatens to strip away $8.7 billion from Washington's investments in clean technologies. In a statement obtained by the governor's office, Ferguson highlighted, ""This bill is anything but beautiful for Washington. It’s a fossil fuel wish list that penalizes clean energy and favors pollution."" Indeed, the governor conveyed the bill's adverse effects, signaling trouble for the clean energy sector, which has previously enjoyed a period of robust growth and support.

As ramifications extend beyond the environmental realm, the human cost comes into sharp focus. The U.S. Climate Alliance has projected a grim forecast, estimating that 21,800 jobs in Washington could vanish by 2030 due to the reconciliation bill's slashes in tax credits pivotal for clean energy and manufacturing sectors.

Washington's struggle for energy security is further compromised by the bill, just as electricity demand is on an upward trajectory. As homes throughout the state grapple with energy needs, the U.S. Climate Alliance predicts a notable increase in electricity costs for Washington households, which could surge by $115 per year by 2029, all because of the bill’s removal of energy tax incentives for wind and solar. Tellingly, Governor Ferguson conveyed to his office, ""Donald Trump and the MAGA Congress are dismantling the very incentives that have powered innovation, created jobs, lowered electricity costs and protected the environment.""

Amid this legislative back-and-forth, the citizens of Washington are left to ponder the real costs of such policies—financially, environmentally, and personally.

However, that could change if the measure results in significant economic growth, as Trump’s economic advisors predict it will.
NC State economist Mike Walden says most media coverage of the bill has focused on cuts to services.
“If they can get economic growth going up a percentage point, even two percentage points, that can be amazing in terms of business development, in terms of jobs,” Walden said.
He said some of the deepest cuts will be delayed beyond the 2026 midterms, while economic growth could happen more immediately.","As President Donald Trump signs the massive keystone bill containing his legislative agenda, experts in North Carolina agree it’s too soon to say how the complex measure could affect the economy and the political climate in North Carolina.

HR1, titled the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” makes hundreds of changes to federal spending and tax laws. Polling shows the bill is unpopular with voters across the political spectrum. However, that could change if the measure results in significant economic growth, as Trump’s economic advisors predict it will.

NC State economist Mike Walden says most media coverage of the bill has focused on cuts to services. Missing, he says, has been coverage of the tax cuts for businesses and individuals. He says Trump’s advisors are banking on those tax cuts to produce enough growth to offset the cuts to spending.

“If they can get economic growth going up a percentage point, even two percentage points, that can be amazing in terms of business development, in terms of jobs,” Walden said. “There could be a big boost in our state economy if the expectations that the administration is putting on the results of this plan in the business sector, if they pay off.”

The cuts to federal spending on food assistance, Medicaid, education and health spending will likely leave the state on the hook for at least a billion dollars at a time when state lawmakers are already battling over shrinking revenues.

Walden says a booming economy could turn those state revenue numbers around, but added that economists remain divided on how much growth the bill will create. And tariffs are, still, the big wildcard. They’re supposed to begin July 9 unless they’re delayed again.

“I've talked [to] a lot of business groups. That's the number one issue they talk about,” Walden said. “If the tariffs are imposed, that could wipe out any, in my opinion, any benefits in terms of economic growth from the bill that was just passed.”

Political fallout

Western Carolina political scientist Chris Cooper says it’s also too soon to know how the new law might affect the upcoming midterm elections.

Cooper says the bill is much broader and more complicated than either Republicans or Democrats are portraying it.

“There are going to be parts of your life that probably are better from this bill, parts of your life that are worse for this bill,” Cooper said, “and that's going to differ based on how much money you make, where you live, what kind of person you are.”

Cooper says the federal spending cuts will leave state lawmakers “in a pickle” as they decide whether to make additional tax cuts at the state level – a key sticking point in the current budget impasse.

Republican legislative leaders are also likely to face tough decisions about how much state money they’re willing to spend to cover the federal cuts to safety net services like food assistance and Medicaid.

“They are really, truly caught between a rock and a hard place on this, and I'm going to be curious to see, obviously, what this looks like in terms of state legislation,” Cooper said.

He said some of the deepest cuts will be delayed beyond the 2026 midterms, while economic growth could happen more immediately. If that happens, Cooper said, “it's going to be a boon to Republicans.""

""But obviously, Senator Thom Tillis was one of a few Republicans that said, ‘Hey, this is actually bad for the economy, it’s going to be bad for people's lives, and it's going to be bad for us, meaning the Republican Party, in the midterms,'” Cooper added.",https://images.wral.com/asset/news/state/nccapitol/2025/07/04/22075341/screenshot_619_-DMID1-67j1nrcy7-640x480.jpg,N,,2025-07-04 23:03:01.719740

This is for the megabill he and Republicans in Congress pushed over the finish line yesterday afternoon. Speaking under the wing of Air Force One as he departed for a victory rally in Iowa, Trump said the celebration would include a military aircraft flyover.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And it's going to be a great day. So we'll be signing with those beautiful planes flying right over our heads.

MARTIN: The One Big Beautiful Bill, as President Trump has been calling it, contains the president's entire domestic legislative agenda.

MARTÍNEZ: With more, we're joined now by NPR senior White House correspondent Tamara Keith. So, Tam, what is the president saying about this bill's passage?

TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Well, as you might imagine, he and his allies are taking a victory lap. Trump was in Iowa last night for a rally and said with this bill, he kept every major promise he made to voters when he ran for office last year.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

TRUMP: Very simply, the One Big Beautiful Bill will deliver the strongest border on earth, the strongest economy on earth, the strongest military on earth, and ensure the United States of America will remain the strongest country anywhere on this beautiful planet of ours.

(CHEERING)

KEITH: Trump was, to borrow a word he likes to use, rather braggadocious about his success last night, asking, has anybody ever had a better two weeks?

MARTÍNEZ: Now, 48 hours ago, though, there was some drama. I mean, it looked like that bill and the president's timeline were in trouble. So what happened?

KEITH: Well, there were quite a few Republican holdouts, but President Trump turned on the charm, and then he turned up the pressure. And ultimately, all but two Republicans in the House who had been holding out folded. At a press conference after the bill passed, Majority Leader Steve Scalise gave Trump all the credit.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

STEVE SCALISE: Donald Trump absolutely was our closer, and Donald Trump never stopped - every day was there in the fight. Who do I need to call? What do I need to do? No president more directly engaged.

KEITH: This was a pivotal moment in Trump's presidency and he and his party rose to it. It took all-night debates and arm-twisting and passed with incredibly narrow margins in both the House and the Senate. And the question now is whether it becomes a long-term political win or more of an albatross.

MARTÍNEZ: Oh, OK. Sounds like you're talking about the midterm elections.

KEITH: Indeed. Next year, Republicans in swing districts will have to defend their votes. And so far, public polling has found this bill to be pretty unpopular. Democrats have had a lot of success in branding it as a tax cut for the rich at the expense of the poor and the vulnerable. A senior White House official conceded in a call yesterday with reporters that the president and Republicans are going to have to educate the public on what's actually in the bill, including things that are popular, like no tax on tips or expanding the child tax credit.

And another thing to watch is the Medicaid cuts in the bill, which an independent analysis found would cause nearly 12 million people to lose coverage. Those will phase in more slowly, which may give Republicans some political cover because people often don't draw a direct line between things happening in their lives and something politicians in Washington passed years earlier.

MARTÍNEZ: Yeah. Now, still a lot of uncertainty, though, various global conflicts, the U.S. tariff policy. What challenges lie ahead, though?

KEITH: Well, it depends on how you feel about tariffs. Early next week, Trump's tariff pause is set to end and his administration has not had much success striking trade deals. So he says he's just going to start sending letters to countries telling them how high their tariffs will be going forward. Economists say tariffs are going to hit American consumers, but Trump is unconcerned.

Trump is also burning up the phones to various world leaders, trying to wind down the conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine, and then there's Iran - all of which is to say, a president's work is never done.

Atlas Copco's acquisition of ABC Compressors, finalized in July 2025, positions the Swedish industrial giant as a leader in this transformation. This deal is far more than a routine M&A transaction—it's a masterstroke in niche technology dominance, geographic expansion, and disciplined growth strategy. For investors, the stock's current undervaluation relative to its SEK167 price target makes it a compelling buy now.

Niche Technology Dominance: The ABC of Gas Compression

ABC Compressors, founded in 1943, specializes in reciprocating compressors—machines that squeeze gases like hydrogen, natural gas, and biogas into high-pressure systems. These compressors are indispensable for hydrogen refueling stations, gas-to-wire projects, and energy storage facilities. As the world shifts toward decarbonized energy systems, demand for this technology is surging.

Atlas Copco's acquisition secures two key advantages:

1. Technical Expertise: ABC's engineering team has spent decades refining reciprocating compressors, which operate at higher pressures and efficiencies than alternatives. This capability directly addresses the need for reliable gas compression in emerging markets like green hydrogen production.

2. Market Access: ABC's global footprint—factories in China, India, the U.S., and Mexico—complements Atlas Copco's existing European and Asian operations. This integration allows the combined entity to serve regional energy projects without costly greenfield investments.

Strategic Positioning for the Energy Transition

The deal aligns perfectly with Atlas Copco's long-term growth thesis:

- Hydrogen Infrastructure: Reciprocating compressors are a linchpin for hydrogen refueling stations. With global hydrogen investment projected to hit $1.2 trillion by 2030, this acquisition secures Atlas Copco's role as a supplier to the sector's backbone.

- Gas-to-Electricity Systems: ABC's technology also supports gas turbines and combined-cycle power plants, which remain vital for grid stability as renewables like wind and solar expand.

- Vertical Integration: ABC's assets are being absorbed into Atlas Copco's Compressor Technique Business Area, a division already managing $5 billion in annual revenue. This merger reduces integration risks, as the teams and systems are culturally and technically aligned.

Low Risk, High Reward: Synergies and Valuation

Analysts estimate 5–10% revenue synergies by 2027, driven by cross-selling opportunities and cost efficiencies. For instance, ABC's production in China could serve Atlas Copco's mining and construction customers in Asia, while its U.S. factory strengthens ties with North American energy developers.

Critically, the stock remains undervalued. As of June 19, 2025, Atlas Copco trades at SEK133.25, far below the SEK167 price target set by analysts. This discount ignores the ABC deal's strategic benefits and the broader tailwinds of energy transition spending. Even the average analyst price target of SEK172.72 implies a 29% upside, making this a high-conviction entry point.

Why Investors Should Act Now

Catalyst Timing: The acquisition's synergies will materialize gradually, but the stock's current price doesn't reflect this. The July 18, 2025, earnings report will likely highlight progress, potentially triggering a re-rating.

Sector Leadership: Competitors like Ingersoll Rand and Gardner Denver lack the same focus on gas compression for hydrogen. Atlas Copco's disciplined approach to acquisitions (e.g., its June 2025 buy of Kyungwon Machinery in South Korea) reinforces its position as a strategic operator, not a price speculator.

Valuation Safety Net: With a market cap of SEK734 billion, strong free cash flow (SEK31.4 billion trailing twelve months), and a 27.15% ROE, the company is financially robust to weather macroeconomic headwinds.

Final Take: A Rare Opportunity in Industrial Tech

Atlas Copco's ABC Compressors acquisition isn't just a bolt-on deal—it's a strategic cornerstone for dominating a $1.2 trillion energy transition market. With the stock trading at a 20% discount to its price target and minimal integration risks, this is one of the most compelling opportunities in industrial equities today. Investors who act now can capitalize on a 29–40% upside potential, supported by both fundamentals and analyst consensus.",,N,,2025-07-04 23:01:36.259686

The final version extends the 45Z credit through the end of 2029—two years beyond its current expiration date of Dec. 31, 2027.

The budget, which is popularly known as the ""One Big Beautiful Bill,"" is expected to be signed into effect by US President Donald Trump on July 4.

The bill extends 45Z credits by two years, restricts the eligibility of these credits to fuels made from feedstocks grown in the US, Canada or Mexico, retains full transferability throughout the term without large tax liabilities and excludes indirect land use change in calculating lifecycle GHG emissions, which would result in no land use change penalty for corn ethanol.

""From the very beginning of the budget reconciliation process, our goal was to advocate for the inclusion of tax policies that provide certainty, growth opportunities, and market stability for US ethanol producers,"" Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association, said.

Cooper highlighted that the extension and modifications to the 45Z clean fuel production credit, alongside the reinstatement of immediate expensing provisions for research and development, will create a favorable tax policy environment for ethanol producers.

The Section 45Z tax credit, also known as the Clean Fuel Production Credit, is a federal tax incentive established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The final version extends the 45Z credit through the end of 2029 -- two years beyond its current expiration date of Dec. 31, 2027.

Brian Jennings, CEO of the American Coalition for Ethanol, also praised the bill's passage, noting that the survival of the 45Z credit was unexpected when Trump took office.

""We're grateful to our Congressional champions for their steadfast leadership to support and strengthen the 45Z credit, which is remarkable considering the fact most other IRA-era tax credits were limited or phased out in the final package,"" Jennings said.

The legislation excludes emissions from indirect land use change from the calculation of a biofuel's credit value. That change would make it easier for corn-based ethanol to qualify for the credits, according to S&P Global Commodity Insights.

While there were other improvements we had hoped to achieve in the final 45Z language, restoring transferability of the credit, removing indirect land use change (ILUC) penalties, and restricting feedstock eligibility to USMCA countries will strengthen the credit from its original version, Jennings added.

""In terms of the credit term, we preferred the House language which would have extended 45Z through 2031, and we also urged Congress to specifically allow low-carbon farming practices to be monetized through 45Z with the feedstock calculator and guidelines USDA has released, but nevertheless ACE remains committed to working with federal agencies to implement the credit in ways that reward on-farm conservation practices and accelerate the use of homegrown, low-carbon biofuels.""

ACE has been working to help monetize low-carbon farming practices in 45Z through their 10-State USDA Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP).

Once farmers participating in the project have implemented reduced-till, 4R nutrient management, or cover crops, land-grant university scientists will collect soil samples and other field-level data about the resulting carbon benefits to better calibrate the GREET model and the USDA FDCIC to generate more reliable carbon scores for farming practices.

The 45Z credit, originally enacted under the Inflation Reduction Act, provides technology-neutral incentives for clean fuels based on lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions.

The final version extends the 45Z credit through the end of 2029—two years beyond its current expiration date of Dec. 31, 2027.

""The president wants to go big on American energy dominance, and this legislation delivers,"" said Emily Skor, CEO of Growth Energy, a trade association that represents US ethanol producers.

The National Oilseed Processors Association and American Soybean Association, which represent US soybean, canola, flaxseed, safflower seed and sunflower seed crushing industries, praised the final passage of the bill, saying the reforms in the legislation represent a major win for the US oilseed processing industry and American farmers.

The new legislation caps 45Z credits at $1/gal (including for sustainable aviation fuel) except in the case of fuel produced from animal manure.

The new bill has delivered ""generational wins,"" the Iowa Soybean Association said on July 3, citing the extension of 45Z credits and increased Small Biodiesel Producer Credit to 20 cents/gal.

These changes provide some additional stability for the renewable fuels market generally but will cause some disruption in the sustainable aviation fuel and imported feedstock markets, analysts say.

The loss of tax credits for this feedstock will push UCO trade flows towards the EU, according to a Commodity Insights report on advanced biofuels in June.

According to the report, the new regime will tighten supplies and drive up costs as it will not be possible to sustain demand with domestic feedstocks alone.

Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights assessed Chicago Argo ethanol at 1.7230/gal on July 3, at the level of a trade done in the Market on Close assessment process. Platts considered an outstanding bid at $1.7140/gal and an outstanding offer at $1.7250/gal.

Platts assessed New York Harbor any-July barges at $1.8175/gal, at an unchanged 9.50-cent premium over July Chicago paper and assessed New York Harbor any-August barges at $1.8225/gal, at an unchanged 0.50-cent premium over any-July barges.",https://www.spglobal.com/content/dam/spglobal/ci/en/images/platts/general/favicon.ico,N,,2025-07-05 00:03:33.614487

Dinosaurs were long gone, but the ocean teemed with marine creatures such as ancient whales, sharks and sea stars.

That is until one unfortunate day, when life across what’s now southeastern Virginia was obliterated within seconds.

A bolide – an extraterrestrial object such as an asteroid or comet – hurtled out of space and landed in the lower part of the Chesapeake Bay.

“There was a kill zone that would have been several hundred miles out in every direction,” said Rich Whittecar, a geologist and emeritus professor at Old Dominion University.

The volcanic-like lateral blast from the impact ripped through faster than the speed of sound, with exponentially more explosive power than atomic bombs detonated by humans, Whittecar said.

Plants and animals would be “totally shredded” by all the material – and simultaneously incinerated by the intense heat.

“Not a good day,” Whittecar said.

Geologists first pieced together the story of the Chesapeake Bay impact crater in the 1990s. It’s the largest known bolide strike in the U.S. and among the largest in the world.

But new research is the first to document the far-reaching impacts of the collision. Scientists say they uncovered a site 240 miles away in the Sandhills of North Carolina showing traces of a massive tsunami caused by the Virginia asteroid.

And the discovery all started by chance.

A mystery buried underground

Almost a decade ago, retired consulting geologist Bob Ganis was investigating some fossils in Moore County, N.C. when he got a call from a local property owner nearby.

A pipeline was set to be constructed through the edge of her property called Paint Hill Farm, and she wondered if Ganis might like to come investigate the temporary trench as part of his research.

Ganis accepted the offer and it became “one of the most strange days of my life,” he said.

He took a look at the rock layers exposed about 10 feet deep and was “totally baffled.” What he saw didn’t align with his geological understanding of the region.

“I had no idea what it was, and no reports of this kind of geology were available to understand what it was,” he said.

Thus began a yearslong quest to get to the bottom of the mystery trapped in sediment. The first piece of the puzzle was determining the age of the rock layers in question.

Ganis said he found fossilized shark teeth nearby and worked with peers who helped date them to the late Eocene era, which lasted from about 56 to 34 million years ago.

Next Ganis connected with Ralph Willoughby with the South Carolina Geological Survey, and described the mysterious sediment layers. They methodically went through the rock beds to try and explain each within the geological context of the region.

“When we get to the top, this explanation of all this rubble at the top, we’re still scratching our heads,” Ganis said. “‘What is this stuff?’”

One day, looking at photos from the trench site, “a light bulb goes off,” he said. “It struck us (that) this is a tsunami deposit.”

There was no geological history to explain why such a deposit would be there, except for one: the meteoroid strike up in Virginia on that fateful day 35 million years ago.

Solving the mystery

The asteroid, moving at about 44,000 miles per hour, was about 2 to 3 miles wide and blasted an enormous crater into the continental shelf of modern day Virginia, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

Much of the crater is still underwater in the bay, which is why it took until recent decades for scientists to discover. The circular outline of the impact in Hampton Roads includes the bottom half of the Eastern Shore, northern edge of Norfolk and eastern outskirts of the Peninsula and Middle Peninsula.

Like any object that lands in water, the asteroid caused a big splash – a giant tsunami likely thousands of feet high, “the kind of tsunami that the world rarely sees,” Ganis said.

It likely washed over the Blue Ridge Mountains and swept across the Southeast – maybe even over the Atlantic Ocean to lap at the shores of Africa and Europe, he said.

Scientists described such a wide-reaching tsunami when they first investigated the Chesapeake Bay impact crater but no one had found actual remains of it.

Ganis’ team homed in on the tsunami as a likely explanation for the Paint Hill rock formation, but needed more evidence to prove it.

The bottom layer featured charcoal, natural glass and other rock fragments; materials you would expect to fly out of the impact, Ganis said. It also had the hallmarks of a “tremendously hot blast.” Another layer contained ash from the explosion.

Whittecar, the ODU geologist, came in to help figure out the top layer, a sandy conglomeration including petrified wood and what looked like a substance called plinthite. The team needed an expert to confirm.

“I went down (to) look at this stuff and basically said, ‘Yep, that’s plinthite,’” Whittecar said.

The material is an iron-rich, clumpy reddish clay common in tropical regions. Researchers believe the Virginia tsunami swept up this material from the seabed and ended up at Paint Hill.

The presence of iridium in the sediment helped nail down the team’s tsunami theory. It is an extremely rare metal on Earth but common in asteroids.

The researchers published their collaborative findings in the peer-reviewed journal Southeastern Geology last month.

Paint Hill’s owner recently sold the 300-acre property to the nonprofit Nature Conservancy, which plans to turn it over to the state park system to expand the Weymouth Woods Sandhills Nature Preserve.

The tsunami deposits will be preserved and may become a “highlight of the park” through related exhibits and educational activities, Ganis said.

Whittecar said geologists are interested in this type of work largely out of curiosity and advancing knowledge for future generations.

“From the practical hazard prevention side of things,” he said, “of course it does give a little weight to the notion that if we can stop one of these (asteroids) from hitting, it is worth getting out there and nudging that thing out of the way.”

State, federal, and local officials who fought for years to bring the new FBI headquarters to Prince George’s County said Tuesday the fight is not over after the surprise Trump administration announcement that the agency will stay downtown.

The FBI will move into existing space at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center, just a few blocks down Pennsylvania Avenue from the current dilapidated headquarters in the aging J. Edgar Hoover Building, according to a statement from the FBI and the General Services Administration.

“Moving to the Ronald Reagan Building is the most cost-effective and resource-efficient way to carry out our mission to protect the American people and uphold the Constitution,” FBI Director Kash Patel said in the statement.

The move reverses a 2023 GSA decision that identified a site near the Greenbelt Metro for the new headquarters, following years of study and of competition between Maryland and Virginia jurisdictions to land the site.

Gov. Wes Moore (D), Prince Georges’s County Executive Aisha Braveboy (D), and almost all of the state’s congressional delegation — calling themselves Team Maryland — insisted Tuesday that Greenbelt is still the better site.

“Simply moving down the street would ignore the real threats the Bureau faces and further jeopardize the safety of those protecting our communities. That’s why we will be fighting back against this proposal with every tool we have,” the Team Maryland statement said.

The agency has been seeking new headquarters for years to replace the J. Edgar Hoover Building, a brutalist facility that is cramped and has leaks and pieces of concrete occasionally falling onto the street below.

In November 2023, the GSA picked Greenbelt over another site in Prince George’s County, Landover, and over a site in Springfield, Virginia.

Virginia representatives charged that the selection of Maryland was flawed after a federal inspector general’s report released in February found fault with the process. But the report never stated there was a problem with the Greenbelt site itself.

Whatever reservations they may have had about the Greenbelt site, however, was put aside by Virginia’s senators for criticism of the Reagan Building proposal, which Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine said “isn’t a plan, it’s a punt.” The two Democrats said the choice of a new site was typical of the Trump administration’s haphazard approach to the federal workforce.

“For years, Democratic and Republican administrations alike have agreed on the need for a secure, purpose-built headquarters that actually meets the FBI’s mission needs,” said a joint statement from Kaine and Warner, “This announcement brushes aside years of careful planning, ignores the recommendations of security and mission experts, and raises serious concerns about how this decision was made.”

President Donald Trump has never been a fan of moving the FBI out of the District. He tried to cancel it in his first term and in March of this year, less that two months after returning to office, he said he would not let the agency move “three hours away in Maryland, a liberal state.” He quickly said the state’s political leanings had no bearing on his decision, but never corrected the fact that Greenbelt is about 16 miles by car from the current headquarters.

Patel has talked in recent months about relocating headquarters staff to other parts of the country, but Tuesday’s announcement seems to have put that talk on hold.

GSA Public Buildings Service Commissioner Michael Peters said in a statement that move to the Reagan building avoids more than $300 million in deferred maintenance cost the current FBI headquarters.

“We are proud to partner with Director Patel to drive efficiency and improve the quality of space for a productive workforce in service to national security and taxpayers,” Peters said.

According to its website, the Reagan Building is home to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Until recently, it was also home to the U.S. Agency on International Developement, before that agency was gutted by the Trump administration and closed as an independent agency effective Tuesday, presumably freeing up space in the building.

But the building also has 22 event spaces to host weddings and events. Plans are scheduled for two events Wednesday, and a concert series on a plaza starts Monday and continues through September.

Del. Nicole Williams (D-Prince George’s), whose legislative district includes the Greenbelt site, called Tuesday’s decision “very interesting.”

“That [Ronald Reagan] building is a very open building. I’ve gone there for private events and conferences,” Williams, who chairs the county’s delegation in the House of Delegate, said in an interview.

“I still maintain that the Greenbelt site is the better location for the relocation of the FBI. It’s disappointing to hear the administration trying to undermine what was already done through the official GSA process,” she said.

“Congress has already appropriated funds for the purpose of the construction of the new FBI headquarters in Maryland. Now the administration’s attempting to redirect those funds really undermines congressional intent,” Williams said, echoing arguments of Team Maryland.

Williams and her two Democratic District 22 colleagues – Dels. Anne Healey and Ashanti Martinez – sponsored legislation that went into effect Tuesday directing the governor to include $200 million in the state budget “for site redevelopment and to improve transportation infrastructure for the Federal Bureau of Investigation headquarters relocation project.”

WASHINGTON — U.S. House Republicans cleared the “big, beautiful bill” for President Donald Trump’s signature Thursday, marking an end to the painstaking months-long negotiations that began just after voters gave the GOP unified control of Washington during last year’s elections.

The final 218-214 vote on the expansive tax and spending cuts package marked a significant victory for Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., who were able to unify centrist and far-right members of the party against long odds and narrow majorities.

But the legislation’s real-world impacts include millions of Americans expected to lose access to Medicaid through new requirements and slashed spending, and state governments taking on a share of costs for a key nutrition program for low-income families. If voters oppose Republicans at the ballot box in return, it could mean the GOP loses the House during next year’s midterm elections.

In the end just two Republicans in the House and three in the Senate opposed the measure, which the Senate approved earlier in the week with Vice President JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote.

Trump posted on social media numerous times in the days leading up to the vote, thanking supportive Republicans who were praising the bill during interviews and threatening to back primary challenges against GOP lawmakers who stood in the way of passage.

“Largest Tax Cuts in History and a Booming Economy vs. Biggest Tax Increase in History, and a Failed Economy,” Trump posted just after midnight when it wasn’t yet clear the bill would pass. “What are the Republicans waiting for??? What are you trying to prove??? MAGA IS NOT HAPPY, AND IT’S COSTING YOU VOTES!!!”

Trump told reporters while on his way to Iowa for an event that he would sign the bill at 5 p.m. Eastern on Friday, with military aircraft flying over the White House and Republican lawmakers in attendance.

Johnson said during a floor speech the legislation is a direct result of the November elections, when voters gave the GOP control of the House, Senate and the White House.

“That election was decisive. It was a bellwether. It was a time for choosing,” Johnson said. “And I tell you what — the American people chose, overwhelmingly, they chose the Republican Party.”

The package, he said, would make the country “stronger, safer and more prosperous than ever before.”

“We’ve had spirited debates, we’ve had months of deliberation and now we are finally ready to fulfill our promise to the American people,” Johnson said.

Republicans were spurred to write the tax provisions in the legislation to avoid a cliff at the end of the year, created by the party’s 2017 tax law. But the legislation holds dozens of other provisions as well, spanning border security, defense, energy production, health care and higher education aid.

The bill raises the country’s debt limit by $5 trillion, a staggering figure that many fiscal hawks would have once balked at, but is enough to get Republicans past the midterm elections before they’ll have to negotiate another deal to raise the country’s borrowing limit.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office’s latest analysis of the measure projects it would add $3.4 trillion to deficits during the next decade compared to current law.

Jeffries: “It guts Medicaid’

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., called the health care provisions “reckless” during a speech that lasted nearly nine hours, forcing the vote to take place in the afternoon rather than early morning, and said the “bill represents the largest cut to health care in American history.”

“Almost $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid,” Jeffries said. “This runs directly contrary to what President Trump indicated in January, which was that he was going to love and cherish Medicaid. Nothing about this bill loves and cherishes Medicaid. It guts Medicaid.”

The speech broke the eight-hour-and-32-minute record that then-Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., set in 2021 when he sought to delay Democrats from passing a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package. House leaders are allowed to exceed normal speaking limits through a privilege called the “magic minute.”

The nonpartisan health research organization KFF’s analysis of the package shows it would reduce federal spending on Medicaid by nearly $1 trillion during the next decade and lead to 11.8 million people becoming uninsured.

Republicans made numerous changes to the state-federal health program for lower income people and some people with disabilities, including a requirement that some enrollees work, participate in community service, or attend an educational program for at least 80 hours a month.

Medicaid patients will no longer be able to have their care covered at Planned Parenthood for routine appointments, like annual physicals and cancer screenings, for one year. Congress has barred federal taxpayer dollars from going to abortions with limited exceptions for decades, but the new provision will block all Medicaid funding from going to Planned Parenthood, likely leading some of its clinics to close.

Overnight drama

House passage followed several frenzied days on Capitol Hill as congressional leaders and Trump sought to sway holdouts to their side ahead of a self-imposed Fourth of July deadline.

The Senate, and then later the House, held overnight sessions followed by dramatic votes where several Republicans, who said publicly they didn’t actually like the bill, voted to approve it anyway.

GOP leaders didn’t have much room for error amid a narrow 53-seat Senate majority and a 220-212 advantage in the House. That delicate balance hovered in the background during the last several months, as talks over dozens of policy changes and spending cuts in the bill appeared deadlocked.

Any modifications meant to bring on board far-right members of the party had to be weighed against the policy goals of centrist lawmakers, who are most at risk of losing their seats during next year’s elections.

The House passed its first version of the bill following a 215-214 vote in May, sending the legislation to the Senate, where Republicans in that chamber spent several weeks deciding which policies they could support and which they wanted to remove or rework.

The measure changed substantially to comply with the complex rules for moving a budget reconciliation bill through the upper chamber. GOP leaders chose to use that process, instead of moving the package through the regular legislative pathway, to avoid having to negotiate with Democrats to get past the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster.

In the end nearly every one of the 273 Republicans in Congress approved the behemoth 870-page bill.

Maine’s Susan Collins, Kentucky’s Rand Paul and North Carolina’s Thom Tillis voted against it in the Senate and Pennsylvania Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick and Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie opposed passage in the House.

Fitzpatrick wrote in a statement that while he voted to approve the House’s original version of the bill, he couldn’t support changes made in the Senate.

“I voted to strengthen Medicaid protections, to permanently extend middle class tax cuts, for enhanced small business tax relief, and for historic investments in our border security and our military.” Fitzpatrick wrote. “However, it was the Senate’s amendments to Medicaid, in addition to several other Senate provisions, that altered the analysis for our PA-1 community.”

Massie posted on social media that he couldn’t vote for the measure because it would exacerbate the country’s annual deficit.

“Although there were some conservative wins in the budget reconciliation bill (OBBBA), I voted No on final passage because it will significantly increase U.S. budget deficits in the near term, negatively impacting all Americans through sustained inflation and high interest rates,” Massie wrote.

GOP holdouts delay passage

Floor debate on the bill in the House, which began around 3:30 a.m. Eastern Thursday and lasted 11 hours, was along party lines, with Democrats voicing strong opposition to changes in the package and GOP lawmakers arguing it puts the country on a better path.

GOP leaders didn’t originally plan to begin debate in the middle of the night while most of the country slept, but were forced to after holdouts refused to give their votes to a procedural step.

When the House did finally adopt the rule, Pennsylvania’s Brian Fitzpatrick was the sole member of his party to vote against moving onto floor debate and a final passage vote.

Fitzpatrick had posted on social media earlier in the day that he wanted Trump “to address my serious concern regarding reports the United States is withholding critical defense material pledged to Ukraine.”

“Ukrainian forces are not only safeguarding their homeland—they are holding the front line of freedom itself,” he wrote. “There can be no half-measures in the defense of liberty. We must, as we always have, stand for peace through strength.”

Tax breaks and so much more

House Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith, R-Mo., made significant promises to middle-class Americans during floor debate about the tax provisions in the bill that many voters will be watching for in the months ahead.

“Households making under $100,000 will see a 12% tax cut compared to what they pay today. The average family of four will see nearly 11,000 more in their pockets each year,” Smith said. “Real wages for workers will rise by as much as $7,200 a year. A waitress working for tips will keep an extra $1,300, a lineman working overtime after a storm will keep an extra $1,400.”

Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Richard Neal, ranking member on the tax writing panel, said the legislation’s benefits skew largely toward the very wealthy.

“If you made a million dollars last year, you’re going to make a plus of $96,000 in the next tax filing season,” Neal said. “If you made under $50,000 last year, you’re going to get 68 cents a day in terms of your tax relief.”

The extension of the 2017 tax law would predominantly benefit high-income earners. The top 1% would receive a tax cut three times the size of those with incomes in the bottom 60% of after-tax income, according to analysis from the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

Some other tax incentives that critics say skew toward wealthier families include a $1,000 deposit from the federal government for babies born between 2024 and 2028, known as a “Trump account.” The program would track a stock index and gain interest accordingly and families with disposable income could contribute additional funding.

And while Republicans included an extension of the child tax credit to $2,200 per child, it requires the parents to have a Social Security number to claim the tax credit.

The bill will give the president more than $170 billion to carry out his campaign promise of mass deportations of people in the country without permanent legal status. The package would give the Department of Homeland Security $45 billion for the detention of immigrants and give its immigration enforcement arm another $30 billion to hire up to 10,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

Food aid, higher education

The legislation will overhaul federal loans for higher education and how states pay for food assistance that roughly 42 million low-income people rely on, known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.

The bill would cap federal graduate loans to $100,000 per borrower and $200,000 per borrower who is attending law school or medical school. It would also cap the ParentPLUS loans to $65,000.

Under the SNAP changes, the package would require states to shoulder more of the burden in food assistance. Currently, the federal government covers 100% of the cost. The legislation tightens eligibility for SNAP, requiring parents with children aged 6 and older to meet the work requirements when they were previously exempt.

The SNAP changes would reduce federal spending on the program by $230 billion over 10 years.

The GOP megabill cuts clean energy tax credits and claws back some of the funding in former president Joe Biden’s signature climate bill, known as the Inflation Reduction Act.

Some of those cuts to clean energy tax credits include terminating at the end of September a nearly $8,000 rebate for the purchase of an electric vehicle, ending a tax credit by December for energy efficient home upgrades such as solar roof panels and heat pumps.

The package rescinds funds to help local governments and states adopt zero emission standards, and eliminates environmental justice block grants that communities used to address health impacts due to environmental pollution, among other things.

This report has been updated.

WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate voted mostly along party lines late Saturday night to move forward with Republicans’ “big, beautiful bill” that President Donald Trump wants on his desk in less than a week, after a dramatic three-hour pause when several GOP senators withheld their votes.

Republican Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Rand Paul of Kentucky voted against moving forward with the sweeping tax break and spending cuts package that contains many of the GOP’s campaign promises. All Democrats were opposed. Vice President JD Vance came to the Capitol in case a tie-breaking vote was required, but in the end was not needed.

Tillis, who is up for reelection in 2026, had told reporters earlier that he would vote “no” on what is called a motion to proceed and on final passage.

He said in a statement that the legislation would result in tens of billions of dollars in lost funding for North Carolina and force the state to make “painful decisions” about Medicaid. Trump, in a post on social media, later threatened to find primary candidates to challenge Tillis.

The 51-49 vote doesn’t guarantee the bill will make it through a final passage vote, but does make it significantly more likely, even with Republicans’ narrow 53-47 majority.

The procedural vote kicked off a maximum of 20 hours of floor debate on the bill, with half of that time controlled by Democrats and the other half by Republicans, though Democrats after the motion to proceed vote forced a reading of the giant bill expected to take as long as 15 hours. That would mean the floor debate would not begin until sometime Sunday.

Unlike regular bills, budget reconciliation packages are not subject to the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster, so as long as at least 50 Republicans support the package, and Vance casts the tie-breaking vote if needed, the measure will go back to the House.

The vote on the motion to proceed that began at about 7:30 p.m. Eastern was held open for more than three hours, with the votes of four senators in suspense — Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mike Lee of Utah, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming and Rick Scott of Florida. All four eventually voted aye and Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson switched his vote to aye after earlier voting against the measure.

Lee, however, just before the vote was over, announced he had pulled from the bill an extremely controversial proposal to sell some public lands that was opposed by other lawmakers from the West. He said because of the process being used for the bill, he was unable to obtain enforceable safeguards to ensure the land would be sold to American families and not China or foreign interests.

The latest version of the measure had set up the Interior Department to sell at least 600,000 acres of public land and up to 1.2 million acres of public land within 10 years, advocates said.

Critics, including hunters, anglers and other Western state constituents, have ripped the measure as a “land grab,” as put by Jennifer Rokala, executive director for the Center for Western Priorities.

A summary of the provisions by the Energy and Natural Resources Committee said the Bureau of Land Management “must sell a minimum of 0.25% and a maximum of 0.50% of their estate for housing and associated community needs. This will increase the supply of housing and decrease housing costs for millions of American families.”

Golfing with Trump

Senate GOP leaders released new bill text just before midnight Friday that satisfied rural state lawmakers’ worries about financial threats to rural hospitals posed by cuts in Medicaid. The bill also addresses concerns by Murkowski and Dan Sullivan of Alaska about access to food assistance for their constituents despite new restrictions on a USDA program for low-income people.

As talks continued on Capitol Hill Saturday afternoon, a handful of Senate Republicans, including Missouri’s Eric Schmitt and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, were on the golf course with Trump, according to the White House. Graham said on social media that Kentucky’s Paul also played.

Senate Democrats said a fresh financial analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the preliminary Senate text would result in $930 billion in cuts to Medicaid, the joint federal-state low-income health insurance and disability assistance program.

The CBO score was not yet publicly available but Sen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Committee on Finance, pointed to it and slammed the Medicaid provisions as “cruel” in a statement Saturday afternoon.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, also cited the preliminary analysis, pointing to the nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts.

Collins promises amendments

Senate Republicans planned to take their negotiations to the floor and push for amendments after the procedural vote that triggered official debate on the bill, which in its current public version runs 940 pages.

GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who voiced concerns throughout negotiations about rural hospitals and health cuts that would harm low-income individuals, said her vote on the motion to proceed “does not predict my vote on final passage.”

“I will be filing a number of amendments,” she told reporters as she headed into a closed-door working lunch before the Senate convened at 2 p.m. Eastern.

While Sen. Tim Sheehy wrote on social media Saturday afternoon that he was a “no” on the motion to proceed because of a provision to sell off federal public lands, the Montana Republican changed his mind nearly an hour later and declared he would propose an amendment to strip the provision — which was later removed by its sponsor.

GOP Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma painted somewhat of a rosier picture of the mood in the Senate, telling reporters “we’re good.”

“We won’t bring it to the floor if we don’t have the votes,” said Mullin, who was the lead negotiator with House Republicans on state and local tax deductions, or SALT — a sticking point for Republicans who represent high-tax blue states like New York and California.

The lawmakers settled on a $40,000 deduction through 2029 for taxpayers who earn up to $500,000 annually. The level then reverts to $10,000, the current limit under the 2017 tax law.

Medicaid turmoil

Proposed changes to Medicaid have been strongly resisted by rural medical providers who say they are already financially strapped.

Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley told reporters Saturday he would be a “yes” on both the motion to proceed vote and the final bill based on the new rural hospital “transformation program” Senate leadership included in the bill overnight. The measure has yet to be finalized.

The bill’s new version includes $25 billion in a stabilization fund for rural hospitals from 2028 through 2032. The amount is frontloaded to give more of the funds in the first two years.

Critics warn that amount will not fill the financial gaps that rural medical providers will face from losing a sizable portion of federal funding via Medicaid cuts.

While Hawley called the fund a “win” for Missouri over the next several years, he said his party needs to do some “soul searching” over the “unhappy episode” of wrangling over Medicaid cuts.

“If you want to be a working-class party, you’ve got to deliver for working-class people. You cannot take away health care for working people,” he said.

Senators had not yet agreed on other Medicaid provisions as of Saturday afternoon, including a phase-down of the provider tax rate from 6% to a possible 3.5% that’s become hugely controversial.

States use a combination of general revenues, provider tax revenues and in some cases local contributions to fund their Medicaid programs.

Advocates warn that it’s not a guarantee states would be able to backfill the lost revenue, and if they can’t, provider rate cuts and losses of benefits for patients could be on the horizon.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that the House version’s provider tax changes — not as deep as the current Senate proposal — could lead to 400,000 people losing Medicaid benefits.

A full and final financial score for the Senate bill is not yet out as the several provisions remain up in the air.

Hawley also praised the inclusion of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act fund, or RECA, that revives payments for survivors and victims who suffered cancer as a result of U.S. atomic bomb testing and radioactive waste dumps.

Clean energy tax credits

In what clean power advocates dubbed a “midnight dumping,” Senate GOP leadership added language to accelerate the phase out of clean energy tax credits that were enacted under Democrats’ own massive mega-bill in 2022 titled the “Inflation Reduction Act.”

The language, which wasn’t yet finalized by Senate GOP tax writers as of 6 p.m. Eastern Saturday, tightened restrictions on foreign components in wind and solar projects — and added a new tax on those that don’t comply.

Senators largely targeted wind and solar credits, ending them for projects not plugged into the electricity grid by 2028. Additionally credits for wind turbine manufacturers would terminate in 2028.

Other tax credits would be phased out at a faster pace, including those for the production of critical minerals, though a credit for metallurgical coal, used in steelmaking, was added in.

Clean energy industry manufacturers and small businesses had hoped Senate Republicans would ease up rollbacks in the House version.

Kurt Neutgens, president and chief technology officer of Orange EV, told States Newsroom in an interview Friday that any further rollbacks would amount to “cutting our legs out from underneath us.”

Neutgens, whose Kansas City, Kansas-based company manufactures heavy duty electric trucks and chargers, was watching for changes to credits to the commercial clean vehicles credit. New Senate GOP text would terminate the credit in September of this year.

Jason Grumet, president of the Clean Power Association, said in a statement Saturday that imposing new taxes on the industry “will strand hundreds of billions of dollars in current investments, threaten energy security, and undermine growth in domestic manufacturing and land hardest on rural communities who would have been the greatest beneficiaries of clean energy investment.”

Alaska carve-outs

Proposed cuts to federal food assistance remained largely unchanged in the new text released Friday night except for a few carve-outs for Alaska.

If the bill were enacted as written, Alaska’s state government could request a waiver for its citizens from stricter work reporting requirements that critics say will result in some SNAP recipients losing their food benefits.

GOP lawmakers also slightly shifted the timeline for when states will have to begin shouldering SNAP costs — the first time states will be on the hook for the federal food assistance outside of administrative costs.

States would be required to pick up a portion of the costs depending on their “payment error rate” — meaning how accurate states are at determining who needs SNAP, including both overpayments and underpayments.

States that have error rates at 6% or above would responsible for up to 15% of the food program’s cost. According to SNAP error rate data for 2023, the latest available, only seven states had an error rate below 6%.

The new text delays the cost-sharing for states until 2028 and allows states to choose the lesser of their two error rates in either 2025 or 2026.

Starting in 2029, states will be required to use their error rate from three years prior to the current year.

The new text includes the option for Alaska and Hawaii to waive their cost share burden for up to two years if their governments implement an improvement plan. In 2023, Alaska had the highest payment error rate of all states, reaching just above 60%.

Advocates for low-income families worry the cost, which will amount to billions for most state governments, will incentivize states to tighten eligibility requirements for the program, or even drop SNAP altogether.

The left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates the cuts will affect up to 40 million people who receive basic SNAP assistance, including 16 million children and 8 million seniors.

The Senate bill would also increase a state’s share of administrative costs for the program to 75%, up from the previous 50% cost-sharing responsibility with the federal government.

Despite inaccurate public statements from Republicans as recently as in a bill summary released overnight, the bill does nothing to limit food assistance to immigrants without documentation because SNAP was never available to them.

SNAP benefits will remain available to legal permanent residents, and Republicans loosened some language to allow certain immigrants from Cuba or Haiti to access the program.

But if the bill passes, federal food assistance will not be available to refugees and asylees who are already in the U.S. — for example, people from Afghanistan, Ukraine and other war-torn places.

Education revisions

Republicans on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions revised or scrapped several measures that the parliamentarian deemed to not comply with the “Byrd Bath,” a Senate process named for the late Sen. Robert Byrd, according to a summary and new bill text out Friday.

Under the revised text, for any loans made starting July 1, 2026, borrowers will have only two repayment plan options: a standard repayment plan and an income-driven repayment plan. The original proposal would have applied these restrictions to existing borrowers, but the parliamentarian struck that down.

Republicans also nixed a proposal that opened up the Pell Grant — a government subsidy that helps low-income students pay for college — to institutions that are not accredited.

The new plan also scraps a restriction that barred payments made by students enrolled in a medical or dental internship or residency program from counting toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness.

‘Even worse than any draft’

Senate Democrats remain united in opposition to the bill and are expected to slow down final passage by introducing numerous amendments on the floor during what is called the vote-a-rama.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer continued to rally against the package during remarks on the Senate floor Saturday afternoon, saying it’s “hard to believe this bill is worse — even worse — than any draft we’ve seen this far.”

The New York Democrat said “it’s worse on health care, it’s worse on SNAP (the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), it’s worse on the deficit.”

Schumer added that “if Republicans proceed, Senate Democrats will hold them to account.”

“We’ll gear up for another night of vote-a-rama very soon. We’ll expose this bill piece by piece. We will show how it cuts health care, raises costs, rewards the ultra rich.”

The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities condemned the cuts to safety net programs as “all in service to tax cuts that are heavily skewed toward the wealthy and corporations.”

“None of this harm has anything to do with fiscal responsibility: our deficits and debts would soar under this bill,” said Sharon Parrott, the think tank’s president, in a statement Saturday.

The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan watchdog, released a new analysis Saturday finding the Senate version will add roughly $4 trillion to the national deficit over 10 years.

“If you thought the House bill borrowed too much — and it did — the Senate manages to make things even worse,” CRFB’s president Maya MacGuineas said in a statement.

House action

Senate Republicans have spent more than a month rewriting the bills that make up the measure in order to meet the strict rules for moving a budget reconciliation package and to earn support from enough Republicans to actually pass the legislation.

The lawmakers have been struggling to maintain spending cuts passed by House Republicans that will pay for the nearly $4 trillion price tag for extending and expanding the 2017 tax cuts.

The House voted 215-214 to approve its 11-bill version of the package in May. Many of that chamber’s GOP lawmakers hoped the Senate wouldn’t change much, though that hasn’t been the case.

The Senate has modified numerous proposals, including those addressing tax law; Medicaid; and SNAP. The Senate bill also raises the country’s debt limit by $5 trillion, a full $1 trillion more than the House version.

The revisions have led to concerns among both centrist House GOP lawmakers and far-right members of the party, muddying the waters around whether Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., can cobble together the votes needed to clear the package for Trump’s signature.

Republicans hold a 220-212 majority in the House, so leaders there can only lose four members if all of the chamber’s lawmakers are present and voting.

Trump has encouraged Congress to approve the legislation before the Fourth of July, but with time running short and some tempers rising over how the legislation will impact the country’s deficits, that might not be possible.

“The Great Republicans in the U.S. Senate are working all weekend to finish our ‘ONE, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL’,” Trump posted on social media Friday.

“The House of Representatives must be ready to send it to my desk before July 4th — We can get it done,” he added. “It will be a wonderful Celebration for our Country, which is right now, ‘The Hottest Country anywhere in the World’ — And to think, just last year, we were a laughingstock. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”

WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court Friday in a major decision reined in nationwide injunctions by some lower courts that had blocked President Donald Trump’s executive order barring birthright citizenship.

The high court declined to decide the constitutionality of birthright citizenship itself. But the justices said the Trump executive order rewriting the constitutional right to birthright citizenship could go into effect within 30 days after Friday’s ruling in the 28 states that did not initially sue.

The Supreme Court’s 6-3 decision thus raises the prospect that a child born in some states would be regarded legally as a U.S. citizen but not in others until the overall question of constitutionality is settled, unless there is further legal action.

The sweeping ruling also likely could hamper other legal challenges against Trump administration actions in which nationwide injunctions are sought. Democratic attorneys general in the states have been successful in obtaining injunctions in the months since Trump was elected.

“GIANT WIN in the United States Supreme Court!” Trump wrote on social media shortly after the ruling.

Speaking at the White House later, Trump said his administration will move forward with several executive orders that have faced nationwide injunctions, such as suspending refugee resettlement and revoking federal funds from “sanctuary” states and localities.

“Thanks to this decision, we can now promptly file to proceed with these numerous policies and those that have been wrongly enjoined on a nationwide basis, including birthright citizenship,” Trump said.

Liberals on the high court issued a strong dissent. “No right is safe in the new legal regime the Court creates,” wrote Justice Sonia Sotomayor. “Today, the threat is to birthright citizenship. Tomorrow, a different administration may try to seize firearms from law abiding citizens or prevent people of certain faiths from gathering to worship.”

Joining the dissent were Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson.

Barrett writes ruling

In the ruling, the conservative justices found that nationwide “injunctions likely exceed the equitable authority that Congress has given to federal courts.”

“The Court grants the Government’s applications for a partial stay of the injunctions entered below, but only to the extent that the injunctions are broader than necessary to provide complete relief to each plaintiff with standing to sue,” according to the ruling, written by Justice Amy Coney Barrett and joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Brett Kavanaugh, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch.

While the dispute before the court related to Trump’s executive order to rewrite the constitutional right to birthright citizenship, the Trump administration asked the high court to instead focus on the issue of preliminary injunctions granted by lower courts.

“The applications do not raise—and thus the Court does not address—the question whether the Executive Order violates the Citizenship Clause or Nationality Act,” according to the ruling, referring to the practice of granting citizenship to babies born on U.S. soil.

Attorney General Pam Bondi, who appeared at the White House with the president, predicted the Supreme Court in its new term in October will take up the merits of the executive order that aims to redefine birthright citizenship.

The high court’s ruling instructs lower courts to “move expeditiously to ensure that, with respect to each plaintiff, the injunctions comport with this rule and otherwise comply with principles of equity.”

In the first 100 days of the second Trump administration, through April 29, judges issued about 25 nationwide injunctions, according to the Congressional Research Service.

“The lower courts should determine whether a narrower injunction is appropriate; we therefore leave it to them to consider these and any related arguments,” according to the ruling.

A narrower injunction could refer to a class action suit.

Barrett argued that a nationwide injunction would not grant more relief for barring the enforcement of Trump’s executive order against a pregnant person who is not a U.S. citizen and fears their child would be denied citizenship.

“Her child will not be denied citizenship. And extending the injunction to cover everyone similarly situated would not render her relief any more complete,” according to the ruling. “So the individual and associational respondents are wrong to characterize the universal injunction as simply an application of the complete-relief principle.”

Stateless people

Trump ran on a reelection campaign platform promising mass deportations of people without permanent legal status and vowed to end the constitutional right of birthright citizenship.

During the press conference at the White House Trump said that birthright citizenship historically was only meant to benefit the children of the newly freed African Americans, not the children of immigrants.

“It wasn’t meant for people trying to scam the system and come into the country on vacation,” Trump said.

Under birthright citizenship, all children born in the United States are considered citizens, regardless of their parents’ legal status.

If birthright citizenship were to be eliminated, more than 250,000 children born each year would not be granted U.S. citizenship, according to a recent study by the think tank the Migration Policy Institute.

It would effectively create a class of 2.7 million stateless people by 2045, according to the study.

In last month’s oral arguments, Solicitor General D. John Sauer, who argued on behalf of the Trump administration, contended that it’s unconstitutional for federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions. Instead, he said, the injunctions should be limited to those who brought the challenges.

‘Consequences for the children’

New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin said during a briefing with reporters that one group of private individuals that challenged the executive order has already filed a class action suit.

“I suspect more will come,” Platkin said.

Washington state Attorney General Nick Brown said at the press conference of Democratic attorneys general that because of Friday’s ruling, the rights of future newborns who hail from states that have not directly challenged the order will be in question.

“In Washington and New Jersey and Massachusetts, Connecticut, your rights are much more strong, but in all those other states, including many of our neighbor states, not participating in this case is going to have consequences for the children born in those states,” Brown said.

With 22 states part of the initial suits challenging Trump’s birthright citizenship order included, that means the order could impact the 28 states that were not part of the initial suit.

Those 28 states are: Alaska, Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming.

‘The gamesmanship in this request is apparent’

Sotomayor, in her dissent, argued that the Trump administration brought the question of nationwide injunctions before the high court because it would be “an impossible task” to prove the constitutionality of the birthright citizenship executive order.

“So the Government instead tries its hand at a different game. It asks this Court to hold that, no matter how illegal a law or policy, courts can never simply tell the Executive to stop enforcing it against anyone,” she said. “Instead, the Government says, it should be able to apply the Citizenship Order (whose legality it does not defend) to everyone except the plaintiffs who filed this lawsuit.”

“The gamesmanship in this request is apparent and the Government makes no attempt to hide it. Yet, shamefully, this Court plays along,” she continued.

Sotomayor also questioned the irreparable harm the Trump administration would face.

“Simply put, it strains credulity to treat the Executive Branch as irreparably harmed by injunctions that direct it to continue following settled law,” she said.

She argued that the issue of birthright citizenship was ratified in the 14th Amendment of the Constitution in 1868, following the Civil War, to establish citizenship for newly freed Black people. It was meant to rectify a 1857 case in Dred Scott v. Sandford where the Supreme Court initially denied citizenship to Black people, whether they were free or enslaved.

“By stripping all federal courts, including itself, of that power, the Court kneecaps the Judiciary’s authority to stop the Executive from enforcing even the most unconstitutional policies,” Sotomayor said. “That runs directly counter to the point of equity: empowering courts to do complete justice, including through flexible remedies that have historically benefited parties and nonparties alike.”

Origins of birthright citizenship case

The case, Trump v. CASA, was consolidated from three cases.

George Escobar, the chief of programs and services of CASA, which brought the case, said in a statement that the ruling from the high court “undermines the fundamental promise of the Constitution — that every child born on U.S. soil is equal under the law.”

“Today’s decision sends a message to U.S.-born children of immigrants that their place in this country is conditional,” Escobar said. “But we are not backing down.”

The CASA case was on behalf of several pregnant women in Maryland who are not U.S. citizens who filed their case in Maryland; the second came from four states — Washington, Arizona, Illinois, and Oregon — that filed a case in Washington state; and the third came from 18 Democratic state attorneys general who filed the challenge in Massachusetts.

Those 18 states are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin. The District of Columbia and the county and city of San Francisco also joined.

This is not the first time the Supreme Court has addressed the issue of birthright citizenship.

In 1898, the Supreme Court upheld the 14th Amendment, in United States v. Wong Kim Ark, extending birthright citizenship.

In that 19th-century case, Ark was born in San Francisco, California, to parents who were citizens of the Republic of China, but had legal authority to be in the United States, such as a temporary visa. While Ark was born in California, his citizenship was not recognized when he went on a trip to China. Upon his return to California, he was denied reentry due to the Chinese Exclusion Act— a racist law designed to restrict and limit nearly all immigration of Chinese nationals.

When his case went all the way to the Supreme Court, the high court ruled that children born in the U.S. to parents who were not citizens automatically become citizens at birth.

The Trump administration has argued that the 1898 case was misinterpreted and point to a specific phrase: “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States.

Government attorneys contend that the phrase in the 14th Amendment means that birthright citizenship does not apply to people in the U.S. without legal status or temporary legal status who are “subject to the jurisdiction” of their country of origin.

Globally, the shift to electric vehicles continues to move rapidly, not driven solely by policy or climate concerns but as a technological revolution toward a better, more efficient product that can save consumers significant amounts of money over time. Despite geopolitical uncertainties, electric cars are on track to make up more than one in four vehicles sold worldwide by the end of this year, up from one in five in 2024 as they become more affordable in more markets—from the EU and China to emerging markets such as Thailand and Brazil.

But government policy has played a key role in moving EV adoption into the mainstream in mature markets like Norway, the EU and China and has become even more critical as recent U.S. policy changes have created risk and uncertainty in the global investment climate.

Canada is facing pressure to repeal its Electric Vehicle Availability Standard (also known as a “ZEV mandate”) from a traditional auto sector that is headquartered in and highly integrated with the United States. This pressure comes at a moment when American EV and clean energy policy is moving starkly away from the direction the rest of the world is headed. Other countries and jurisdictions, including the U.K., are meeting global trade headwinds not with a backslide on policy but by recalibrating to meet the moment. In contrast, the U.S. just passed a bill projected to cause wholesale electric power prices to increase roughly 50% by 2035 and cumulative annual consumer energy costs to increase more than $16 billion by 2030 (the majority of which relates to vehicle fuel). It’s estimated some 830,000 renewable energy jobs (many of these EV- and battery-related) will be lost or not created by 2030 as developers cancel a significant number of the announced clean energy manufacturing facilities, and between 2025 and 2034, cumulative U.S. GDP could decrease by more than $1 trillion.

Ultimately, the EV Availability Standard is a policy for consumers, not the auto sector. The Canadian auto sector has benefited from exclusionary tariffs; nearly $3 billion and $1.2 billion in federal government spending on consumer incentives and charging infrastructure, respectively, to secure demand for EVs; and government investments of over $50 billion to secure manufacturing facilities, in addition to pre-existing support to help shore up an industry that was in decline prior to the EV shift. But the EV Availability Standard is only one tool in what should be considered a broader policy package intended to increase choice for consumers that want to purchase an EV and to drive down prices over time. Any adjustments to the EV Availability Standard must be considered in the context of this broader support package and how it should be geared toward helping Canadian consumers and households in addition to industry.

Clean Energy Canada’s recommendations

Canada needs an EV package that aims to deliver a selection of affordable EVs under the price point of $40,000 to Canadians by 2030. Multiple polls have shown that this is the price the vast majority of Canadians wish to pay for a new car, electric or gas-powered (Clean Energy Canada commissioned a to-be-published survey in Toronto and Vancouver that found 73% of respondents wishing to spend less than $40,000 on a new EV). The federal government has multiple policy tools at its disposal to help achieve this goal. While the EV Availability Standard will play an important role, EV rebates, reducing tariffs on Chinese-made EVs, and other policy approaches can also assist.

In a newly published survey from Abacus Data, “lower costs and help Canadians get ahead” was ranked as the No. 1 most important priority for the Carney government, with 89% of Canadians saying it was a priority. After housing costs, transportation spending is the second biggest bill for households, and simply put, creating the conditions for more affordable EVs that will in turn save their drivers thousands of dollars a year on fuel and maintenance is one of the best affordability maneuvers any government could possibly make right now.

A successful package to deliver affordable, under-$40,000 EVs in Canada could include:

Retooling the EV Availability Standard to help support consumer choice by attracting models at competitive price points. If the federal government is going to revisit its targets, it should focus on near-term adjustments to help automakers weather this temporary storm while maintaining the longer-term trajectory and market signal that Canada is committed to going electric. Any additional flexibility added in the regulation should be designed to achieve other EV-related goals, such as delivering more affordable EVs and building out Canada’s charging network.

Reigniting EV demand by recapitalizing the EV incentive program with a focus on affordable EVs, using lower eligibility price caps to help drive down vehicle prices. The rebate should start at $5,000 and decline by $1,000 each year, providing consumers and automakers with a well-communicated phaseout that avoids periods of artificially lowered EV sales as buyers await the return of rebates or at least clarity.

Reconsidering Canada’s trade approach by lowering the tariff on Chinese-made EVs (72% of Canadians support) and allowing in a limited quota of these affordable vehicles while also recognizing EU-approved vehicles (70% support). Doing so would open Canada’s vehicle market to fill important market gaps, drive innovation and ultimately make our auto sector more competitive.

On clean energy generally and EVs specifically, Canada must now decide whether to follow the path of the U.S. in becoming an island of fossil-fuel-powered and aging technologies, or if we wish to chart a course that better aligns with global direction and that balances the critical objectives of consumer affordability and domestic industrial competitiveness.",https://cleanenergycanada.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EV-Charge-shutterstock_623342945-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-07-05 00:02:25.840842

WOWK 13 News has reached out to the UMWA for an updated statement now that the bill has passed.","CHARLESTON, W.Va. (WOWK) – The West Virginia Coal Association is praising the passage of the massive budget bill passed by Congress on Thursday, however, not every coal mining organization is on board.

The controversial bill made its second round through the House of Representatives with a vote of 218-214, which President Donald Trump is expected to sign Friday evening. All Democrats and two Republicans voted against the bill.

The West Virginia Coal Association says the passage marks an “important step toward restoring balance and accountability in American energy policy.” The organization applauded the Trump administration, as well as West Virginia’s Congressional delegation, all four of whom voted in favor of the bill, also called the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”

“For years, the coal industry has been burdened by excessive regulation and uncertainty. The OBBB helps reverse that trend by implementing reforms that ease permitting, improve access to federal lands, and eliminate policies that placed domestic producers at a disadvantage,” said Chris Hamilton, president of the WVCA.

The WVCA points out that the bill includes several changes they have sought to “level the playing field” in the energy sector, such as phased reduction of certain clean energy tax credits, phasing out electric vehicle and charging stations subsidies, a 10-year delay in methane emission fees, recognition of base load power generation’s importance in the nation’s electric grid, and incorporation of certain coals as critical minerals for advanced manufacturing.

“These provisions support a more balanced approach to energy development while reaffirming the importance of coal as a dependable source of affordable, baseload power. The legislation provides greater certainty for operators, workers, and communities that rely on a strong coal economy— particularly in West Virginia,” Hamilton said.

While the WVCA supports the bill, the United Mine Workers of America, however, spoke out against it prior to its passage. On June 27, the UMWA released a letter by UMWA International President Cecil E. Roberts, who is from West Virginia, calling the bill “dangerous.”

“This legislation isn’t just a bad idea, it’s a dangerous one,” said UMWA International President Cecil E. Roberts. “It strips resources from the very people who keep our country running; miners, veterans, public servants, and their families, just to give billionaires a bigger tax break. Cutting off health care access, closing Black Lung clinics, and turning our backs on working-class communities is not how we move forward as a nation.”

In the letter, Roberts shared concerns that rural America would be hit the hardest by the Medicaid cuts included in the legislation. He said this could lead to reduced care, including for black lung clinics that provide vital care to miners who have contracted the disease. You can read the full letter here.

(""Battery X Rebalancing Technologies""), has successfully completed a real-world driving trial demonstrating a significant increase in estimated driving range for a fully electric, Class 3 commercial electric vehicle, or light-duty electric vehicle (the ""Electric Truck""), following a full battery rebalancing process using the Company's patent-pending second-generation lithium-ion battery rebalancing hardware and software platform (""Prototype 2.0"").

As part of its ongoing performance validation program for Prototype 2.0, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies recently conducted a series of real-world road tests on a rebalanced Electric Truck to evaluate post-rebalancing driving range and battery efficiency. The Electric Truck was supplied by an authorized Canadian distributor of the Electric Truck (the ""Electric Truck Authorized Distributor"") and, as represented by the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor, had previously demonstrated a significantly degraded driving range of approximately 40 kilometers per full charge caused by significant natural cell imbalance caused by real-world conditions.

In response to this battery capacity performance deficiency, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies performed a battery rebalancing procedure on the Electric Truck utilizing Prototype 2.0, as initially disclosed in the Company's news release dated June 6, 2025. During the associated rebalancing trial (the ""Rebalancing Trial""), Battery X Rebalancing Technologies successfully completed a full rebalancing process on a 144-cell lithium-ion battery pack composed of lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) chemistry, which had exhibited substantial imbalance attributable to real-world operating conditions. The Rebalancing Trial demonstrated complete (100%) recovery of imbalance-related capacity loss and yielded a 37.7% increase in the Rated Capacity (as defined in the June 6, 2025 news release) of the Electric Truck's battery pack.

The Results

Following completion of the rebalancing procedure, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies conducted a series of controlled real-world performance evaluations (each, a ""Trial"" and collectively, the ""Battery Range Performance Trials"") on the Electric Truck for the purpose of assessing post-rebalancing improvements in battery range and overall energy efficiency under actual operating conditions. In the first Trial, the Electric Truck traveled a total distance of 41 kilometers, utilizing approximately 14% of its available battery capacity, while operating across a combination of highway and city driving environments. In the second Trial, the vehicle completed a distance of 107.3 kilometers while consuming approximately 35% of its battery capacity, under similarly mixed driving conditions. The third Trial, conducted exclusively under city driving conditions, demonstrated that the vehicle traveled 58.2 kilometers while utilizing approximately 21% of its available battery charge (collectively, the ""Results"").

The Results demonstrate a material improvement in the estimated driving range and effective battery capacity of the Electric Truck. Specifically, post-rebalancing performance testing indicates an estimated driving range of approximately 295 kilometers per full charge under no-load conditions. These figures represent an increase of up to 255 kilometers in driving range under no-load conditions, corresponding to an approximately 637.5% improvement of battery driving range, as compared to the pre-rebalancing range of approximately 40 kilometers. The Results affirm the technical efficacy and commercial relevance of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' proprietary rebalancing process and support its broader applicability within light-duty electric vehicle fleets and other commercial electric transportation use cases.

The Electric Truck parent company has represented that the Electric Truck's expected driving range under maximum payload conditions is approximately 290 kilometers. Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' Battery Range Performance Trials yielded an estimated range of approximately 295 kilometers under no-load conditions following rebalancing. Although these figures were obtained under different load scenarios, the close alignment between the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor's reported range and the post-rebalancing estimate supports the reliability of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' testing methodology. Furthermore, the Results underscore the potential of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing process to restore battery performance to levels consistent with the high end of manufacturer-reported specifications.

The Battery Range Performance Trials were performed under no-load conditions; it is relevant to note that payload can have an effect on energy consumption and overall driving range. This consideration is consistent with widely recognized industry dynamics and is disclosed to provide a complete and transparent understanding of factors that may influence real-world vehicle performance. Range may vary based on payload, terrain, driving behavior, and other operational conditions.

These performance outcomes further validate the effectiveness and market relevance of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' proprietary rebalancing solution in restoring degraded battery capacity and materially extending the remaining useful life of commercial electric vehicle batteries. The Company believes these results provide compelling technical validation in support of Prototype 2.0's broader commercial deployment, particularly in fleet environments where range reliability, battery lifespan longevity, and total cost of ownership are mission-critical considerations.

Significance of Results & Market Opportunity for the Electric Truck

The Results of the Rebalancing Trial and the Battery Range Performance Trials collectively demonstrate that Prototype 2.0 is capable of effectively rebalancing lithium-ion battery packs exhibiting significant, naturally occurring cell imbalance. This successful outcome builds upon previously disclosed validation milestones achieved by Battery X Rebalancing Technologies, including third-party technical validation conducted by the National Research Council of Canada (as referenced below), as well as the Company's news release dated May 30, 2025, announcing the successful rebalancing of a naturally imbalanced Nissan Leaf battery pack-the second most common out-of-warranty electric vehicle platform in the United States.

Importantly, the Results not only validate the technical efficacy of Prototype 2.0 in an Electric Truck application, but also demonstrate its potential to recover substantial lost battery capacity resulting from cell imbalance. This performance reinforces the relevance of the Company's patent-pending technology in practical, real-world scenarios and highlights the broader need for scalable, cost-effective battery recovery solutions. The Battery Range Performance Trials further substantiates the commercial viability of Prototype 2.0 as a solution to extend the remaining useful life of aging battery packs in commercial electric vehicle fleets.

The Electric Truck and associated Electric Truck battery pack were supplied to Battery X Rebalancing Technologies at no cost for testing and evaluation by the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor, who advised that it owns and operates a fleet of approximately 20 Electric Trucks (the ""Electric Truck Fleet""). According to the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor, multiple vehicles within the Electric Truck Fleet have exhibited material battery degradation and capacity loss attributable to cell imbalance. The Rebalancing Trial and the Battery Range Performance Trials were undertaken in response to the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor's request for a viable alternative to full battery replacement, which it advised may be financially prohibitive on a fleet-wide basis.

The objective of the Rebalancing Trial and the Battery Range Performance Trials was to determine whether Prototype 2.0 could effectively restore functional battery performance in a degraded battery unit sourced from the Electric Truck Fleet. Upon successful rebalancing, the Battery Range Performance Trials further aimed to quantify the extent of recovered battery capacity in terms of estimated driving range. The positive Results are expected to inform and support ongoing discussions with the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor regarding the potential deployment of the rebalancing solution across its broader fleet, with the goal of extending battery life and mitigating the operational and financial impact of premature battery replacements.

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies has been informed by the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor that a substantial number of similar electric trucks are currently in operation across various markets, including those held by the Electric Truck's parent company, authorized distributors, commercial fleet operators, and private owners. Many of these vehicles are reportedly experiencing battery degradation symptoms consistent with cell imbalance. This feedback underscores a broader market opportunity for Battery X Rebalancing Technologies to provide a scalable, cost-effective rebalancing solution aimed at extending battery life and reducing total cost of ownership for commercial EV stakeholders.

In conjunction with the Rebalancing Trial and the Battery Range Performance Trials, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies is currently advancing the development of standardized operating procedures (""SOPs"") tailored to the Electric Truck Battery Pack, in addition to refining user interface and workflow enhancements within Prototype 2.0. The Company is also actively pursuing a commercial manufacturing agreement to support scalable production and deployment of its rebalancing platform. These activities are intended to further the Company's broader commercialization strategy, which is not limited to any single third-party opportunity. The Electric Truck-specific SOPs, however, are being developed in direct response to the successful Battery Range Performance Trials and the interest expressed by the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor.

There can be no assurance that Battery X Rebalancing Technologies will enter into any definitive commercial arrangement with the Electric Truck Authorized Distributor or any other third party at this time. While the Company remains encouraged by the Rebalancing Trial and the Battery Range Performance Trials, which demonstrate an apparent need in the marketplace, any future commercial arrangement will be subject to further technical validation, negotiation of mutually acceptable terms, and completion of all necessary operational readiness milestones.

Despite falling short by nearly 3,000 vehicles to meet the anticipated delivery of 384,112 units, this situation hasn't dampened Tesla's stock performance. The firm's unrelenting strides into areas like robotaxis, humanoid robotics and solar energy solutions have sparked interest among investors and industry observers.

Shifting EV market dynamics

For years, Tesla has been a prominent figure in the US EV market, with a commanding share peaking at 75% in the first quarter of 2022.

However, the landscape has evolved dramatically, with Tesla's market share dipping to 43.5% by early 2025. Competitors such as General Motors are emerging as formidable rivals, thanks to an extensive array of EVs offered across its Chevrolet, Cadillac, GMC Hummer, and Buick brands.

Cassandra Garber, Chief Sustainability Officer at General Motors said: “We’re now the #2 EV company in the US, thanks to the dozen EV models we offer across the Chevrolet, Cadillac, GMC Hummer and Buick brands.

On the global stage, Tesla faces substantial competition from the likes of BYD, which captured 22.2% of the global EV market in 2024, leaving Tesla with a 10.3% share. Other manufacturers, including Wuling, BMW, and Li Auto, are steadily advancing in this competitive arena.

As Tesla juggles between maintaining its market foothold and diversifying its business model, industry experts are keenly watching how its ventures into energy and automation will impact its core vehicle business.

Solar and energy storage ventures

Expanding beyond automotive manufacturing, Tesla has made significant investments in the solar energy sector. It initially ventured into this domain by acquiring SolarCity in 2016 for $2.6 billion, with the objective of building a fully integrated sustainable energy enterprise.

Tesla not only constructs photovoltaic solar systems but also provides installations and associated services. The company's collaborations in this sphere are noteworthy, as demonstrated by its 15.3 GWh storage agreement with Intersect Power in 2024.

While the use of cameras for autonomous navigation may present cost advantages, it also poses challenges, drawing both regulatory scrutiny and public attention. The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has emphasized that it ""does not pre-approve new technologies or vehicle systems,"" insisting that manufacturers adhere to safety standards as they self-certify their compliance and undergo investigation for potential safety concerns.

Tesla's launch of autonomous vehicles in June 2025 in Austin, Texas, faced scrutiny when online footage appeared to show robotaxis breaching traffic laws. This led the NHTSA to initiate contact with Tesla to address the matter, signifying ongoing regulatory dialogue as Tesla advances in automated driving technologies.

Its stock rose, supported by strong trading volume of over 81 million shares. This surge comes after big announcements from the company and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) backing. It may mark a turning point for Plug Power’s clean hydrogen growth.

Plug Power’s role goes beyond financial gains: it is helping build the hydrogen infrastructure needed to support global net-zero goals. Its clean hydrogen and fuel cell technology provides a low-carbon option for transport, logistics, and industry.

With government support and a clear pipeline of green projects, Plug is aiming to help power a net-zero future—one hydrogen molecule at a time.

DOE Loan Boosts Plug’s Green Hydrogen Expansion

Plug Power secured a $1.66 billion conditional loan guarantee from the DOE’s Loan Programs Office. This funding will support the development of up to 6 green hydrogen production plants across the United States.

The DOE’s backing lowers financial risk and strengthens Plug’s ability to scale operations in a capital-intensive market. Its hydrogen expansion plans also help send the company’s stock skyrocketing as seen below.

The first of the six projects is located in Graham, Texas. The facility will run on renewable energy from wind power and use Plug’s in-house electrolyzer technology. Plug will also deploy its own liquefaction systems built in Houston, helping control costs and supply.

As of now, the company produces about 45 tons of liquid hydrogen per day, with capacity expected to grow as new plants come online.

RELATED: Element Resources to Build America’s Largest $1.85B Green Hydrogen Plant in California

The DOE loan allows Plug to accelerate its green hydrogen network at a lower cost of capital. It also makes the company a key player in the clean energy shift. This is important for tough sectors to decarbonize, like industry and long-haul transport.

Tax Credit Clarity Supports Market Confidence

Plug Power’s outlook also improves because of the new guidance from the U.S. Treasury. This guidance focuses on clean hydrogen tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). These rules give companies like Plug more flexibility in how they source power for hydrogen production. For example, they allow for different types of renewable energy and other sources such as renewable natural gas or coal mine methane.

With clearer rules in place, Plug and its partners can better plan projects and reduce risks related to compliance and eligibility. The DOE loan, along with clear regulations, is boosting market confidence in Plug Power’s long-term strategy.

Hydrogen Math: How Plug Plans to Slash Carbon Emissions

Plug Power has set ambitious goals for hydrogen production. The company plans to produce 500 tons per day (TPD) of green hydrogen in North America by 2025 and reach 1,000 TPD globally by 2028. These targets support the company’s goal to help decarbonize logistics, transportation, and industrial sectors.

At full scale, these hydrogen volumes can replace large amounts of fossil fuels:

500 TPD of hydrogen could replace about 640,000 gallons of diesel per day

This shift would help avoid around 2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions each year

Reaching 1,000 TPD could reduce more than 4 million metric tons of CO₂ annually

Plug is achieving these results through its expanding production network. It partners with users in shipping, warehousing, and data centers.

Sustainability Strategy and ESG Reporting

Plug Power has made progress in its environmental, social, and governance (ESG) efforts. In its 2023 ESG report, the company confirmed that it has completed its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions inventory and is starting to track Scope 3 emissions. These steps help in understanding the company’s total carbon footprint. This includes direct operations, the supply chain, and customer use.

The company also reports several sustainability-focused actions, including:

Using wind and solar energy to power hydrogen plants

Recycling precious metals from fuel cells and electrolyzers

Treating and reusing wastewater for hydrogen production

Designing fuel cells and systems with circular economy principles

Plug has partnered with companies like Johnson Matthey to reduce the amount of rare materials needed in its equipment. This helps lower costs and reduces environmental impact over time. The company is also working on product lifecycle planning to improve repairability and extend equipment use.

Moreover, Plug has joined global net-zero leadership groups. CEO Andy Marsh is part of advisory boards that focus on sustainable energy. These roles reflect the company’s commitment to broader climate and policy goals beyond its direct operations.

Powering Partnerships, From Forklifts to Data Hubs

Plug Power is not just planning projects—it is actively deploying hydrogen solutions across different industries. One recent example is its partnership with Southwire, a major cable and wire producer.

The hydrogen developer is supplying hydrogen-powered forklifts and a fueling station to Southwire. This will help them reduce over 1 million pounds of CO₂ emissions each year at one facility.

The company’s technology is also used in Amazon’s warehouses. There, hydrogen-powered forklifts take the place of traditional fossil-fuel vehicles. These projects show how Plug’s hydrogen systems are already helping reduce emissions in real-world settings.

Risks Remain, But Hydrogen’s Time Has Come—And Plug’s at the Helm

While Plug’s recent gains are promising, the company still faces challenges. Hydrogen production and infrastructure remain expensive, and many customers are early adopters.

The market is also influenced by trade policy and fluctuating costs for equipment and raw materials. Earlier this year, Plug faced cost pressures from having to buy hydrogen on the spot market due to supply shortfalls.

Despite these obstacles, the DOE loan and IRA tax support may help level the playing field. Analysts believe the funding could ease the financial strain of large-scale production and improve Plug’s long-term competitiveness. The company is also focused on improving efficiency and scaling its technology to reduce costs over time.

The company’s environmental goals are also taking shape. Plug is taking action with its ESG reporting, hydrogen targets, and partnerships. They are moving past promises to show real results. From warehouse logistics to industrial transport, Plug’s hydrogen solutions are helping companies reduce emissions today.

As clean energy policies roll out and demand for low-carbon fuels rises, Plug Power could gain an advantage. They are an early mover in green hydrogen. Its vertical integration—from electrolyzer manufacturing to hydrogen delivery—gives it more control over quality, pricing, and reliability.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/shutterstock_2444260637-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-04 22:06:19.837728

July 2, 2025

The tax cut megabill in Congress with a historic rollback on Medicaid also includes provisions reversing U.S. clean energy policies, advocates warned Wednesday, harming not only the environment but the economy.

“This legislation will kill economic growth and jobs, raise energy prices, and cede clean energy technology manufacturing to other countries,” said Carly Ebben Eaton, Wisconsin Policy Manager for the Blue Green Alliance, a coalition of labor unions and environmental groups.

Eaton took part in two online news conferences Wednesday to draw attention to the federal budget reconciliation bill and its repeal of key portions of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

The budget bill has been the top priority of the Republican majority in Congress as well as the administration of President Donald Trump. It was drawn up to extend tax cuts enacted in 2017 during Trump’s first term that will expire at the end of 2025.

The package returned to the U.S. House for final action after a tied vote in the U.S. Senate that required Vice President JD Vance to pass the measure on Tuesday.

Steep cuts to Medicaid and federal nutrition programs have drawn the most attention during debate on the bill, along with the Congressional Budget Office finding that the wealthiest taxpayers will benefit most from its tax cuts.

The bill also includes measures that would undo several provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), one of the signature pieces of legislation enacted during President Joe Biden’s four years in office. After its passage the act was lauded by environmental advocates for provisions to address climate change by encouraging clean energy through tax credits as well as federal investments.

The House version of the GOP bill “already dealt a serious blow to clean energy tax credits and investments,” Eaton said Wednesday, “but the Senate took it even further, doubling down on cuts that will cost jobs, stall progress and raise energy costs.”

Consumer, business renewable energy incentives

The IRA’s tax breaks were designed to encourage consumers to move to energy-efficient and clean energy appliances and vehicles and encourage utilities and other businesses to increase their use of renewable resources such as solar energy and wind power.

Eaton said Wednesday that clean energy tax credits are supporting more than $8.6 billion in private investments in Wisconsin.

Garrik Harwick, assistant business manager of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers union Local 890 in Janesville, said that over the past three years more than 300 members have worked on solar projects in Southern Wisconsin. He spoke at a news conference with Eaton and several other union leaders.

The IRA tax breaks have encouraged those developments, Harwick said, and the investments have included increased apprenticeship slots, bringing in new trainees.

“These investments don’t just deliver clean energy,” Harwick added. “They create good paying union jobs that strengthen our local communities.”

He warned that repealing the tax credit will likely reduce the use of clean energy technologies and increase energy costs by 6% for homeowners and more than 9% for business customers.

The IRA’s provisions that encouraged apprenticeships helped “open doors that many didn’t even know existed,” said Andy Buck, government affairs director for the Wisconsin and Upper Michigan district of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades.

He said the union has added a number of jobs, including apprentices, installing energy-efficient glass in buildings on projects that were facilitated by the Inflation Reduction Act.

“When someone enters a registered apprenticeship program, they aren’t just learning a trade,” Buck said. “They’re building a career, gaining self-respect, and finding a path to a better life.”

Another provision of the 2022 law opened up tax credits for renewable energy to nonprofit organizations and government agencies, allowing them to receive direct payments to the federal government comparable to the value they’d receive from the tax credit if they paid taxes.

A new middle school being built in Menasha will include solar panels and energy storage, said Matt VanderPuy, a business agent for the Sheet Metal workers union in Sheboygan. The direct pay program will reimburse the district $3 million, he said, while the energy savings is projected at $190,000 per year.

“This is money that they can reinvest into the students, the teachers and the school district,” while saving on property taxes, VanderPuy said.

‘Very ugly impacts,’ says advocate

At another news conference, former Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes observed that more than 90% of the jobs that IRA incentives helped create are in Republican congressional districts — although no Republicans in the state delegation voted for the bill. Barnes leads Forward Wisconsin, a nonprofit established during Biden’s term in the White House to inform people about the Biden administration’s infrastructure and climate investments and to defend them.

But business uncertainty this year, which Barnes blamed on GOP positions including Trump’s tariff executive orders, has led nationally to the cancellation of projects worth $15.5 billion, he said.

“The so-called big beautiful bill is going to have some very ugly impacts in Wisconsin, ripping away tax incentives for wind and solar farms, for rooftop solar, for farm sustainability programs, for clean cars and school buses,” said Amy Barrilleaux, communications director for Clean Wisconsin, at the event with Barnes. “And giving more tax breaks to big oil and gas companies does absolutely nothing to create jobs here or any opportunities here — it’s a gift to big oil at the expense of Wisconsin families and at the expense of our environment.”

Heather Allen, policy director for Elevate, an energy efficiency nonprofit, said as many as 11,000 clean energy and manufacturing jobs in Wisconsin could be at risk.

Plans for a $2.5 billion network of electric vehicle charging stations in the state have stalled, Allen said, and Wisconsin manufacturers that would have supplied components “are going to lose that opportunity now.”

“This legislation is going to strangle our solar businesses with red tape,” Allen said. “What you have here is an attack on small businesses that are delivering clean energy solutions to help families save money on their energy bills. And that includes solar installers, but it also includes other home energy contractors, other construction jobs.”

In four recent polls, a majority of those surveyed disapproved of the Republicans’ megabill — making it “more unpopular than any piece of major legislation that’s been passed since at least 1990,” Barnes said.

At the labor news conference, Emily Pritzkow, the Wisconsin Building Trades Council executive director, said advocates are urging people to contact their members of Congress.

“The polling on this is abysmal, and as long as people continue to call and deliver that message , that is what we need to do right now,” Pritzkow said. “Now is the time to weigh in, not once it’s coming to your front door, impacting you, your community, and people you care about.”",https://i0.wp.com/vernonreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/dsc07931.jpg?fit=1920%2C1281&ssl=1,N,,2025-07-04 22:06:00.204224

The surprise production drop has sent shockwaves through the auto sector. Higher gasoline prices threaten consumer discretionary spending, particularly for SUVs and trucks—key profit drivers for companies like Tesla (TSLA) and General Motors (GM).

Stock Impact:

- Ford (F) and GM (GM) fell 5–7% in early June as traders anticipated weaker demand.

- Tesla (TSLA) dipped 3%, though its electric vehicle focus provides some insulation.

Strategy: Reduce exposure to auto equities until refinery outages subside.

2. Energy Services: A Golden Opportunity

The shortage has created tailwinds for energy infrastructure and equipment firms. Companies like Schlumberger (SLB) and Halliburton (HAL) are positioned to benefit from refinery upgrades, pipeline expansions, and alternative fuel investments.

Growth Catalysts:

- Contracts for Gulf Coast pipeline maintenance.

- Refinery retrofits to boost efficiency.

- Demand for biofuel blending technology.

Strategy: Overweight energy services stocks for multi-quarter growth.

Policy & Fed Considerations

The Federal Reserve monitors gasoline prices as a core inflation metric. A prolonged supply crunch could delay rate cuts, as policymakers prioritize price stability over near-term growth. The Fed's July meeting will scrutinize the EIA's June 26 inventory report, which may signal whether production is rebounding.

Key Risk: If auto sales weaken further, the Fed may adopt a more hawkish stance, amplifying market volatility.

Conclusion: Pivot to Energy, Hedge Autos

The EIA data underscores a stark divide between sectors:

- Bearish on Autos: Higher fuel costs erode consumer spending and margins.

- Bullish on Energy Services: Infrastructure upgrades and supply chain fixes drive demand.

Watchlist:

- July 15 OPEC+ Meeting: Will producers boost output to ease prices?

- EIA Weekly Reports: Track refinery utilization rates and crude inventories.

The letter represented rare public criticism from agency employees who knew they could face blowback for speaking out against a weakening of funding and federal support for climate, environmental and health science.

In a statement Thursday, the EPA said it has a ""zero-tolerance policy for career bureaucrats unlawfully undermining, sabotaging and undercutting"" the Trump administration's agenda.

Employees were notified that they had been placed in a ""temporary, non-duty, paid status"" for the next two weeks, pending an ""administrative investigation,"" according to a copy of the email obtained by The Associated Press. ""It is important that you understand that this is not a disciplinary action,"" the email read.

More than 170 EPA employees put their names to the document, with about 100 more signing anonymously out of fear of retaliation, according to Jeremy Berg, a former editor-in-chief of Science magazine who is not an EPA employee but was among non-EPA scientists or academics to also sign.

Scientists at the National Institutes of Health made a similar move in June, when nearly 100 employees signed a declaration that assailed Trump administration ""policies that undermine the NIH mission, waste public resources, and harm the health of Americans and people across the globe."" An additional 250 of their colleagues endorsed the declaration without using their names.

But no one at NIH has been placed on administrative leave for signing the declaration and there has been no known retribution against them, Jenna Norton, a lead organizer of the statement, told AP on Thursday.

Zeldin began reorganizing the EPA's research and development office as part of his push to slash its budget and gut its study of climate change and environmental justice. And he's seeking to roll back pollution rules that an AP examination found were estimated to save 30,000 lives and $275 billion every year.

The EPA responded to the employees' letter earlier this week by saying policy decisions ""are a result of a process where Administrator Zeldin is briefed on the latest research and science by EPA's career professionals, and the vast majority who are consummate professionals who take pride in the work this agency does day in and day out.""",https://phantom-elmundo-us.unidadeditorial.es/b1b63ade1baebace1c747df3d009b2a1/crop/308x205/2764x1842/resize/1200/f/webp/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2025/07/04/17516302667037.jpg,N,,2025-07-05 02:03:54.974151

Denver7 dug into the nearly 900-page bill to get answers about when Coloradans can expect to start feeling the effects of some of the key provisions.

Some changes will begin in a matter of weeks, while others won’t kick in for a few years.

Read the full bill below

Tax credits for electric vehicles and solar energy

If you’re looking to buy an electric vehicle, you may want to act soon. A provision in the new law gets rid of the $7,500 federal tax credit that made buying electric vehicles significantly cheaper.

The tax credit, which was set to expire in 2032, will now expire on September 30, 2025.

A federal tax credit that helped homeowners cut the cost of installing solar panels by 30 percent will also end much sooner. Originally set to expire in 2032, it will now expire on December 31, 2025.

Tax changes

Coloradans will notice changes when filing their taxes next year.

The 2017 tax cuts, which were set to expire this year, will continue. While that might not feel like a tax cut, there are new provisions that will lower tax bills, including an increase in the standard deduction (increasing by $750 for single filers and $1,500 for couples).

Taxpayers age 65 and older will get a break, as the law increases the senior bonus deduction by $6,000.

Workers will also be able to deduct up to $25,000 on tips when filing federal taxes next year and up to $12,500 on overtime pay. Those provisions will expire in 2028.

Changes to SNAP, Medicaid

No timeline was given for provisions expanding work requirements for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which means they could potentially start this year.

Many of the changes to Medicaid, including new work requirements, won't take effect until after the 2026 mid-term election. Provisions that critics say will result in cuts to Medicaid and food programs also won't begin until after the 2026 election.

It'll be up to states like Colorado to figure out how to implement all the requirements, a task many state officials are dreading.

Immigration

The bill provides $150 billion for immigration enforcement, including $45 billion for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to build more detention centers through 2029.

Against odds that at times seemed improbable, Trump achieved his goal of celebrating a historic — and divisive — legislative victory in time for the nation’s birthday. Fighter jets and a stealth bomber streaked through the sky over the annual White House Fourth of July picnic as Trump and first lady Melania Trump stepped out onto the White House balcony.

“America’s winning, winning, winning like never before,” Trump said, noting last month’s bombing campaign against Iran’s nuclear program, which he said the flyover was meant to honor. “Promises made, promises kept and we’ve kept them.”

The White House was hung with red, white and blue bunting for the regular Fourth of July festivities. The United States Marine Band played patriotic marches — and, in a typical Trumpian touch, tunes by 1980s pop icons Chaka Khan and Huey Lewis. The two separate flyovers bookended Trump’s appearance and the band playing the national anthem.

The legislation extends Trump’s 2017 multitrillion-dollar tax cuts, preventing a huge tax increase if they had not be extended. It provides for a massive increase in immigration enforcement.

The legislation passed the House on a largely party-line vote Thursday, culminating a monthslong push by the GOP to cram most of its legislative priorities into a single budget bill that could be enacted without Senate Democrats being able to block it indefinitely by filibustering.

It passed by a single vote in the Senate, where North Carolina Republican Thom Tillis announced he would not run for reelection after incurring Trump’s wrath in opposing it. Vice President JD Vance had to cast the tie-breaking vote.

In the House, where two Republicans voted against it, one, conservative maverick Tom Massie of Kentucky, has also become a target of Trump’s well-funded political operation.

The legislation amounts to a repudiation of the agendas of the past two Democratic presidents, Barack Obama and Joe Biden, in rolling back Obama’s Medicaid expansion under his signature health law and Biden’s tax credits for renewable energy.

Trump exulted in his political victory Thursday night in Iowa, where he attended a kickoff of events celebrating the country’s 250th birthday next year.

“I want to thank Republican congressmen and women, because what they did is incredible,” he said. The president complained that Democrats voted against the bill because “they hate Trump — but I hate them, too.”",https://www.freedom969.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ap1-1-937x625.webp,N,,2025-07-05 00:03:51.423062

And if the EPA wanted to take the money back, there’s a different process the agency would need to follow.
In the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill, Congress made their intent crystal clear in repealing the program entirely and returning those billions in unobligated funds to the U.S. Treasury,” EPA spokesperson Brigit Hirsch said in a statement.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The sprawling tax and policy bill that passed Congress repeals a multibillion-dollar green bank for financing climate-friendly projects, and the Trump administration should be allowed to freeze its funding and cancel related contracts with nonprofits, federal officials said in a court filing.

Climate United Fund and other nonprofits in March sued the Environmental Protection Agency, its administrator Lee Zeldin and Citibank, which held the program’s money. The lawsuit argued the defendants had illegally denied the groups access to billions awarded last year through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, commonly referred to as a “green bank.” The program was created by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

But the bill that passed Congress on Thursday would repeal the part of the 2022 law that established the green bank and rescind money that hadn’t already been obligated to its recipients.

The EPA said the bill should hand them a victory in their court fight that is being heard by a federal appeals court in Washington. Now that Congress has rescinded funding, an earlier federal judge’s decision forcing the EPA to release money to the groups should be reversed, the agency said in its Thursday court filing.

Climate United Fund disagrees. It acknowledges that the bill in Congress is a “significant policy setback” but argues that most of the money had been disbursed and is unaffected by the bill. And if the EPA wanted to take the money back, there’s a different process the agency would need to follow.

“Our funds have already been obligated and disbursed. Any effort to claim otherwise is simply a lie to justify illegal attempts to claw back funds intended to benefit communities across the country,” CEO Beth Bafford said in a statement.

The Congressional Budget Office estimated repealing the program would save just $19 million, which is in line with its administrative expenses only, indicating the bill doesn’t touch the multibillion-dollar grant awards, according to Lauren Tsuboyama, spokesperson for the Power Forward Communities coalition, which received a green bank award.

According to the EPA, when the agency terminated the grants the funds “became unobligated.”

“Grantees have desperately performed legal gymnastics to hold tens of billions of taxpayer dollars hostage. In the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill, Congress made their intent crystal clear in repealing the program entirely and returning those billions in unobligated funds to the U.S. Treasury,” EPA spokesperson Brigit Hirsch said in a statement.

The green bank’s goals run counter to the Trump administration’s opposition to policies that address climate change and its embrace of fossil fuels. Zeldin quickly made the bank a target, characterizing the $20 billion in grants as a scheme marred by conflicts of interest and potential fraud.

In February, Zeldin told Fox News that he suspected the green bank “was a clear cut case of waste and abuse” that “in my opinion, is criminal.” The following month, Zeldin terminated the grants.

U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan has previously said that when the federal government was asked for evidence of fraud, the agency didn’t provide it and shifted its position. Chutkan decided the government can’t terminate the contracts and that the groups should have access to some of their frozen money.

That order was put on hold during the EPA’s appeal.

The agency argues the nonprofits are making constitutional and statutory arguments that don’t apply in what it sees as a simple contract fight.

If the government successfully argues the case is a contract dispute, then the EPA says it should be heard by a different court that can only award a lump sum – not force the government to keep the grants in place. Federal officials argue there is no law or provision in the Constitution that compels the EPA to make these grants to these groups.

In its court filing, the EPA also pointed to comments by Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, chair of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, as supportive of the agency’s position. Capito said previously the bill intended to rescind billions in funding that had been frozen.

“This action reflects not only Congress’s deep concern with reducing the deficit, but EPA’s administration of the (green bank) under the Biden administration, the agency’s selection of grant recipients, and the absence of meaningful program oversight,” the agency quotes the senator as saying.

Defense spending also benefits, as armed services spending is set to increase by $150 billion under the bill.

""Whatever you think of the bill, these folks have created a lot more certainty in the markets,"" Haines at Pangea says.","Manufacturing and defense companies stand to win from the ""big, beautiful bill,"" while wind and solar fare worse and hospitals could be hit hard.

Why it matters: Investors welcome the certainty of the bill, but are also nervous about heavily exposed sectors.

The big picture: Companies will get expanded provisions on itemization and expenses, including 100% bonus depreciation, which allows business to deduct expenses immediately rather than over three years.

Henrietta Treyz of Veda Partners says this could benefit manufacturers, although the stimulative effects of the bill could be muted by tariffs on things like steel and aluminum.

""The John Deeres and Caterpillars of the world benefit from a 100% bonus depreciation"" historically, she says.

Defense spending also benefits, as armed services spending is set to increase by $150 billion under the bill.

Couple that with the administration's push to grow the defense budget to over $1 trillion annually and it's a boost in spending that ""markets do not appreciate…at all,"" says Terry Haines, founder of Pangaea Policy.

Palantir, an AI-focused defense contractor with ties to Donald Trump, is still among the top five best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 this year.

The other side: While a proposed tax on wind and solar projects was taken out of the bill, tax credits are still set to be removed.

Tax credits are key to the economics of solar installation investments, and ""for many in that sector, this bill would represent their fears confirmed,"" per a statement from John Gimigliano, principal in charge of federal tax legislative and regulatory services at KPMG U.S.

The removal of a $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit is set to be a headwind for EV sales, which could be another pain point for Tesla (though its stock recently rallied even after soft delivery numbers.)

Hospitals have ""just gotten absolutely smoked, so much so that quite frankly there's no way that these cuts go into effect,"" according to Treyz.

The Congressional Budget Office has estimated $1.1 trillion in health care cuts from the bill. This could weigh on hospital REITs that benefited from that government spending.

The loss of social safety nets for millions of Americans could be an additional pressure point to the broader economy over time.

The bottom line: Winners and losers aside, at least the market has a better handle on what's coming now.

The government have made some substantial down payments on the regional agenda.
With ongoing support, the regional agenda might be the government’s best bet for securing the improvements living standards our country is crying out for.","They’ve certainly faced a very difficult international context and a hard economic outlook - whilst stumbling over the political handling of some key domestic policies. Yet on the regional agenda, we’ve seen welcome focus and flurry of action to deliver on the government’s promise of “raising living standards in every part of the United Kingdom”. One year in, it’s time to take stock of the big decisions shaping the future of our regions.

First off, the government’s decision to change the fiscal rules to allow for greater capital investment at their first Budget was significant - for the North and our regions. Following interventions from colleagues at IPPR amongst others, the government decided to change the self-imposed rules which determine how much Government can borrow to invest. As a result, government gave itself the ability to borrow to invest an additional £100bn over this parliament which has since enabled significant capital investment across the country.

At the same time, the government’s ‘Green Book’ - a method of appraising the cost and benefits of projects which is often seen as a big constraint on investing in regions by government – has also received a welcome update. But perhaps even more importantly, the political will to invest in places like the North has been evident.

Transport in the North and the Midlands was a significant beneficiary of the changed fiscal rules. The Chancellor announced £15.6bn of transport funding to be handed to mayors for intra-regional transport last month. This means the beginnings of a new mass transport system in West Yorkshire and tram extensions in Manchester, amongst several other projects. The key difference to previous announcements on transport was that it was attached to a Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR), a fiscal event, which means the finances are in place to deliver. Next, we need to see investment between, as well as within northern places, to begin to continue our journey to catch up on the £140bn our region missed out on since 2009/10.

The government’s recently announced industrial strategy also shows promise, setting out a clearer direction for the UK’s economy after the chaos of 11 economic strategies in 13 years. It has come down hard on some clear choices – with a focus on clean energy, defence and advanced manufacturing. These are sound choices not just from an economic and security standpoint, but they’re regionally focused too. After years of an economy tilted towards financial services and the South East, this plan takes a place-first approach, investing in the industries that the North leads in. Green manufacturing, for example, is one of our superpowers: we already produce half of England’s renewable energy and deliver 36 per cent of UK jobs in green goods and services.

There are other areas we are expecting to see progress in, too.

The upcoming English Devolution and Community Empowerment Bill sets out the government’s latest devolution plans and will seek to put “devolution by default” into practice. This is to be welcomed. Unfortunately, the narrative has been dominated by the unitarisation proposed as part of the package (one can only assume a Treasury – MHCLG stand-off). For communities, it’ll be critical that in the context of unitarisation, power is felt going downwards not only up to a higher level of local government.

But of course, it hasn’t all been smooth sailing.

The early promise of the government’s new Council of Nations and Regions, with a focus on investment and growth across the UK, has yet to demonstrate that it is the new frontier of government and mayoral relations. At risk of becoming the meeting where agendas are rubber stamped, it seems to have lost momentum.

Local government finances, the underpinnings of all local and regional plans, remain precarious. Whist they received modest increases at the Comprehensive Spending Review this year, it by no means undoes the past 14 years of rampant cost cutting by the previous government. And there are still big questions to answer, not least on social care. However, the recent local government consultation on fairer funding shows government is willing to take on the big question of fairness in local spending, with deprived places set to receive a greater share.

Elsewhere, fiscal devolution is still the elephant in the room. The mayors well know that without even some financial independence they will still, in many ways, be beholden to government. Quite rightly they’re calling for change. We’ve called for the visitor levy – a small tax on tourists – to be introduced to help mayors upgrade their places. It would be small step to show Treasury gets it and may help us move towards progressing fiscal devolution in the years to come.

The government have made some substantial down payments on the regional agenda. The mayors, with their “place before politics” mantra, are also rightly taking what they can into their own hands. With ongoing support, the regional agenda might be the government’s best bet for securing the improvements living standards our country is crying out for.

Employees were notified that they had been placed in a ""temporary, non-duty, paid status"" for the next two weeks, pending an ""administrative investigation,"" according to a copy of the email obtained by the AP.

Scientists at the National Institutes of Health made a similar move earlier in June, but Berg said he was unaware of anyone at the NIH who had been placed on similar administrative leave.

Under Administrator Lee Zeldin, the EPA has cut funding for environmental improvements in minority communities, vowed to roll back federal regulations that lower air pollution in national parks and tribal reservations, wants to undo a ban on a type of asbestos, and proposed repealing rules that limit planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions from power plants fueled by coal and natural gas.

The EPA responded to the employees' letter earlier this week by saying policy decisions ""are a result of a process where Administrator Zeldin is briefed on the latest research and science by EPA's career professionals, and the vast majority who are consummate professionals who take pride in the work this agency does day in and day out.""

However, the news is not all bad for Tesla, as the company could still see one of its best quarters this year thanks to the megabill. The U.S. House of Representatives officially passed the megabill yesterday, and it is due to be signed by the president today, July 4. The bill ends the $7,500 EV tax credit, effective September 30, 2025. This means that people looking to buy an EV in the U.S. will end up paying $7,500 more starting in October. Although the tax credit was subject to certain conditions, it remained an attractive incentive for EV buyers.

Notably, customers who intend to buy an EV before the tax credit expires have only the current quarter to complete their purchase. This could significantly boost Tesla’s vehicle sales in the third quarter, which ends on September 30. Tesla CEO Elon Musk and President Trump have engaged in a heated public dispute over the bill’s proposal to eliminate these tax credits.

Tesla Got Off to a Slow Start in 2025

Tesla’s EV deliveries during the first half of 2025 have been significantly lower. Compared to the same quarters in the prior year, Tesla’s auto deliveries fell by 13% in Q1FY25 and 14% in Q2FY25. In the first six months of 2025, Tesla delivered 720,803 autos, suggesting it could deliver a total of around 1.4 million autos this year. However, this would mark a sharp decline from the 1.8 million EVs delivered in both 2024 and 2023.

It is worth noting that Tesla’s deliveries typically grow stronger in the second half of the year. So, there is still potential for a major turnaround, especially in Q3, given the incentive of EV tax credits.

Tesla Is Offering Free Upgrades to Red, White, and Blue Paint

Notably, Tesla is capitalizing on the Independence Day holiday by offering free Ultra Red, Pearl White, and Deep Blue Metallic paint upgrades on certain EV models in the U.S. until July 14. The offer applies to the revamped Model 3 and Model Y, as well as existing inventories of the 2025 Model S and Model X.

Furthermore, Tesla can leverage the situation by offering other incentives, such as interest-free loans (0% Annual Percentage Rate) and special offers on financing or leasing its EVs. These types of promotional incentives can also bolster Tesla’s EV sales in the short term.

Customers keen on buying an EV will have a good chance to claim the tax credits over the coming three months. While this applies to all EV manufacturers, Tesla stands to benefit the most from this incentive, as it is currently the largest EV manufacturer in the U.S.

Is Tesla a Buy or Sell Today?

Analysts are currently taking a cautious stance on Tesla’s stock due to ongoing challenges. On TipRanks, TSLA stock has a Hold consensus rating based on 14 Buys, 12 Holds, and nine Sell ratings. Also, the average Tesla price target of $293.09 implies 7.1% downside potential from current levels. Year-to-date, TSLA stock has lost 21.9%.

Oil and gas industry praises bill for advancing energy dominance agenda

WASHINGTON - Advocates of clean energy on Thursday decried the final passage of President Donald Trump's tax cut bill by the House of Representatives as a reversal of course on the energy transition, while fossil-fuel interests rejoiced. Trump's fellow Republicans in the House passed the bill 218-214 and it now heads to the president's desk. Trump is expected to sign it on Friday.

The legislation sharply cuts access to a 30% tax credit for solar and wind power projects that had been set to run until 2032 and which developers had relied on.

Research firm Energy Innovation projected that the bill would result in a fall of 300 gigawatts of U.S. electricity capacity, as demand soars for the first time in two decades, driven by growth in data centers and artificial intelligence.

Meanwhile, demand for power from data centers is estimated at upward of 100 GW, according to nonprofit group American Clean Power.

The bill's passage ""is a dramatic swing in federal policy, disrupting the good-faith investments of American companies that are powering our economy and creating hundreds of thousands of jobs,"" said Jason Grumet, president of American Clean Power.

Jefferies global investment bank said in a research note to clients that the phaseout of the wind and solar subsidies will lead to a ""medium-term rush"" to claim credits, which could speed the roll-out of projects for a couple of years. After that period, investors will need to reassess such projects without them.

It said nuclear and geothermal power, energy sources that the Trump administration favors for dependable electricity generation, received better access to credits in the legislation. Battery storage projects will also retain the full tax credit through 2033 and phase out fully by 2036.

The ""longer runway"" for those baseload resources to use the tax credits won praise from the Data Center Coalition, whose members include Amazon and Microsoft.

Mike Sommers, president and CEO of the American Petroleum Institute, said Congress had advanced Trump's ""energy dominance agenda"" of maximizing oil and gas output. Production of oil and gas had already hit a record during the administration of former President Joe Biden.

""We applaud Congress for unleashing our nation’s oil and natural gas resources, and we look forward to President Trump signing this bill into law,"" Sommers said in a release.

COAL GETS A BREAK

Some tax credits favored by the oil industry, like those for hydrogen and carbon capture, were preserved in the bill. The bill also mandates sales of oil and gas drilling rights in federal lands and in waters off Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico, which Trump has renamed the Gulf of America.

It allows coal used in steel making a new production tax break of 2.5% of costs that could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars for the industry. It also reduced royalty rates that coal companies have to pay when mining on public lands.

Rich Nolan, president and CEO of the National Mining Association, said the bill supports ""today's mining industry which stands ready to create additional jobs and revenues for our economy.""",https://decarbonfuse.com/assets/favi/favicon-32x32-b1c94ae87840c662751403aefa5b6ea92417e97aab4cbce5a1b99c4e112cac36.png,N,,2025-07-04 20:07:29.724848

The move is part of a broader debate within Trump's administration over how to engage with Moscow amid the ongoing war in Ukraine.

While Witkoff is reportedly advocating for the easing of energy sanctions, others in the administration disagree. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum favors reducing U.S. reliance on Russian imports rather than expanding trade, according to Politico.

Despite pledging during his campaign to end the war in Ukraine in ""24 hours,"" Trump has made little progress on securing a ceasefire. After nearly seven months of his presidency, and several peace talks between Russia, Ukraine, and the United States, no ceasefire agreement has been reached.

Moscow continues intensifying its attacks against Ukrainian cities. Russia launched one of the largest aerial attacks on Ukraine on July 4, hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin had a phone conversation with Trump.

When journalists asked if he had made any progress with Putin on the call, Trump responded: ""No, I didn't make any progress with him today at all.""

Europe's energy sector is a central issue in the debate. According to Politico, Moscow is in early talks with Washington about potentially restarting the Nord Stream pipeline project, with backing from U.S. investors. The development has sparked concern in Brussels.

One senior EU official reportedly warned that Trump and Putin appear to be aiming to ""divide the European energy market and create (separate) spheres of influence.""

After the House narrowly passed their reconciliation bill in May, the Senate has been deliberating on their own version, navigating Senate parliamentarian rules and intense intraparty debates, with the fate of major programs like Loan Programs Office (LPO) and Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) related energy tax incentives still in the balance. Meanwhile, the Trump administration submitted their FY 2026 budget request to Congress, which provides important insights for the administration's priorities and staffing projections for the Department of Energy (DOE).

Reconciliation Update

In June, Senate committees released revised initial versions of their reconciliation text as part of a broader Republican-led domestic policy package. Key to energy policy initiatives, the Senate Committees on Finance, Energy and Natural Resources (ENR), Environment and Public Works (EPW), and Armed Services (SASC) unveiled their respective sections on June 16, June 11, June 4, and June 3. A comparison of the initial marks relevant to energy from these committees against their House counterparts is shown here. However, each committee's draft has undergone substantial revisions after Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough flagged several provisions as violations of the Byrd Rule, which prohibits extraneous policy matters in reconciliation bills. Working through the parliamentarian's rulings, the Finance Committee and ENR Committee have yet to finalize their texts as of this date. EPW finalized their text on June 25, and SASC finalized their text on June 24. Once finalized, all texts are still subject to modifications on the Senate floor before final votes.

Senate Finance Committee

If there were hopes that the Senate Finance Committee would provide significant pushback against the House's deep cuts to the IRA energy tax credits, those have been largely dashed by Committee and floor actions to date. Of note:

Renewable Energy Generation Tax Credits (Sections 48E, 45Y, 45V, 25D): The House-passed version required projects wishing to claim the 48E or 45Y credit to begin construction within 60 days of the legislation's enactment. To maintain eligibility, projects would have to be operational by December 31, 2028. The Senate Finance Committee version phased out these credits for wind and solar projects beginning construction after 2025, fully eliminating the credits for such projects that begin construction after 2027. For other technologies (e.g., nuclear, geothermal, and hydropower), the Senate Finance version phased out the credits for projects that begin construction after 2033, with the credit being completely phased out for projects beginning construction after 2035. Further, while the House version provided an exception for advanced nuclear projects, the Senate Finance version also provides an exception for solar and wind co-located with energy storage projects.

Despite significant lobbying to ease these restrictions, Senate Republicans moved late last Friday toward an even more restrictive phase-out of the ITC and PTC, aligning with the House bill. According to the newly released text, wind and solar credits are only available for projects placed in service before January 1, 2028. Residential solar projects under Section 25D would need to be put into service by the end of the year, as opposed to six months after passage as proposed by the Senate Finance Committee. Under the new Senate language, the Section 45V tax credit for hydrogen would be extended until the end of 2028, versus eliminating it this year as proposed by the Senate Finance Committee.

In an unanticipated turn, the new Senate language included an excise tax for wind and solar projects. The proposed tax would affect projects that do not meet new restrictions on renewable energy produced with parts tied to certain US adversaries like China. The amount of the tax would be calculated by evaluating the percentage of the value of the components in a project that are sourced from certain prohibited foreign entities. The bill sets a maximum threshold that escalates each year until 2032, and projects that exceed the cap would be penalized.

Senators Murkowski (R-AK), Ernst (R-IA), Grassley (R-IA), and Curtis (R-UT) have all offered amendments to rescind the excise tax and push back expiration dates. Whether they will be successful remains to be seen, though clearly renewable energy investors will need to reset expectations going forward.

Section 45X Advanced Manufacturing Credit: The House-passed reconciliation bill proposed phasing out the Section 45X manufacturing credit one year earlier than current law. In contrast, the Senate version retains the IRA's original phase-out timeline for most components but eliminates the permanent credit availability for critical minerals, instead introducing a gradual phase-down: 75% of the credit in 2031, 50% in 2032, 25% in 2033, and elimination in 2034 and beyond. The Senate version also maintains an early 2027 sunset for wind components and further narrows eligibility by ending credits for integrated component sales after 2025. It also tightens the definition of battery modules, requiring them to include essential equipment such as current collector assemblies and voltage sense harnesses. Projects would remain subject to Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) restrictions, which were slightly more nuanced than those defined in the House bill.

Both the Senate committee language and the House-passed version of the bill terminate the clean vehicle and energy efficiency tax credits; however, the Senate committee language modifies the timeline, ending those credits nine to 12 months after the bill's enactment instead of on December 31, 2025.

One notable omission from the Senate committee language is the proposed annual $250 EV registration fee and $100 hybrid vehicle fee. While House Transportation Chair Sam Graves (R-MO) said he plans to reintroduce the fees if they are excluded from the final package, Senate EPW Chair Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) has indicated the upcoming surface transportation reauthorization bill — expected later this year — may be a more appropriate vehicle for such policy.

Our colleagues at Mintz have provided a broader analysis of the tax provisions from the Senate Finance Committee, viewable here.

Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee

The ENR Committee, chaired by Senator Mike Lee (R-UT), also repeals unobligated balances from IRA energy programs, including nearly all the IRA's supplemental support for DOE's LPO. Simultaneously, the text would establish a new energy dominance financing authority under Title 17 that is similar to the rescinded 1706 program.

However, the ENR Committee was forced to revise language that would have authorized the sale of public lands. Chair Lee submitted a new draft, currently awaiting parliamentarian approval, that eliminates Forest Service land from eligibility and restricts sales to lands at least five miles from population centers. Additionally, the percentage of Bureau of Land Management (BLM) land eligible for sale was reduced from up to 0.75% to a maximum of 0.5%. Despite these changes, ENR Ranking Member Senator Martin Heinrich (D-NM) argued that limiting the scope of land sales would not necessarily bring the proposal into compliance with reconciliation rules. A similar proposal had already been removed from the House-passed version due to Republican opposition, including from Representative Ryan Zinke (R-MT), who called the sale of public land a ""red line,"" and Representative Jeff Hurd (R-CO). Montana Senators Steve Daines (R-MT) and Tim Sheehy (R-MT) have expressed similar opposition to Lee's plans.

Also currently under parliamentarian review is language that would facilitate oil and gas lease sales in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, a 90% revenue sharing agreement with Alaska for oil and gas revenues in the Cook Inlet, and a provision seeking to fast-track coal leases. Already the parliamentarian struck down provisions that would have allowed natural gas export projects to pay a fee to be considered in the national interest, excluded offshore oil and gas projects from National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review, revived the Ambler Mining Road project in Alaska, and promoted geothermal lease sales.

Senate Environment and Public Works Committee

For the Senate EPW text, the Senate parliamentarian upheld that unobligated funds from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) and IRA programs could be rescinded. The full fate of obligated GGRF funds, however, is still the subject of litigation. The final draft also removed an initial attempt to roll back Biden-era tailpipe emissions standards for model year 2027 and eliminated language that would have shielded fast-tracked NEPA reviews from judicial challenges.

Senate Armed Services Committee

The House-passed bill contains a provision appropriating $2.5 billion for ""additional activities to improve the United States production of critical minerals through the National Defense Stockpile"" while the SASC text contains a provision to appropriate $2 billion ""for additional activities to improve the United States production of critical minerals through the National Defense Stockpile Transaction Fund."" The Senate appropriates $3.3 billion for ""grants made pursuant to the Industrial Base Fund"" while the House proposes $3.5 billion.

An additional $5 billion is included in the SASC reconciliation text ""for investments in critical minerals supply chains made pursuant to the Industrial Base Fund.""

Both the House-passed bill and the Senate text appropriate $500 million to the ""Department of Defense Credit Program Account"" to carry out the capital assistance program, including loans, loan guarantees, and technical assistance for critical minerals and related industries and projects, including related Covered Technology Categories.

DOE's Headcount

DOE released further justification for their FY 2026 budget request on May 30, building on the administration's earlier ""skinny budget"" and reaffirming DOE's commitment to shifting priorities away from renewable energy, decarbonization, and commercialization, to fossil fuels, nuclear, geothermal, and research and development.

The FY 2026 budget requests $46.3 billion in discretionary funding for DOE, including a nearly 26% cut to nondefense energy programs. The request also provides the best opportunity to date to see the potential impact of administration efforts to shrink the DOE and other federal agency workforces. While the budget is likely to undergo significant changes as it works its way through the appropriations process, the personnel headcount tables provided are likely an accurate reflection of the actions the administration is taking. A table summarizing the personnel counts from the budget justification can be found here.

The tables show a net loss of more than 1,700 full-time equivalent employees across DOE. While this is equivalent to only 11% of the reported DOE workforce, offices responsible for clean energy and tied to the Biden administration implementation of the IRA would appear to bear the largest and disproportionate cuts.

Among the most severe impacts will be felt at LPO. The personnel cuts are spread over several different budget program lines, though the overall totals indicate a 58% reduction in federal workforce.

Also notable was the elimination of the Office of Technology Transitions (OTT), with its mission to expand the commercial and public impact of DOE's research investments being moved under the Departmental Administration account, which is being cut by 18%. The Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED) is facing a potential 95% staffing cut as the budget proposes winding the office down. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright has already announced the termination of 24 OCED projects, totaling more than $3.7 billion in financial assistance, citing a lack of economic viability and a misalignment with the administration's current priorities.

The Grid Deployment Office (GDO), which is responsible for modernizing and strengthening the electric grid, faces a 63% staffing cut and a potential 75% reduction to its budget. It will rely on unobligated funds from previous years to continue selected projects under its Energy Assurance and Resource Adequacy initiative.

The Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) Office is facing a 45% staffing cut as well as a potential 74% budget cut as the administration reorients to early-stage research and development in geothermal, hydropower, biofuels, industrial efficiency, and critical minerals while programs such as solar, wind, and hydrogen are zeroed out.

The numbers given were for FY 2026, which begins on October 1, 2025. Many at DOE and other agencies were given a deferred retirement plan, which would place them on administrative leave until the end of the 2025 calendar year. It's not clear to what degree these additional reductions are part of the FY 2026 employee totals, though it's likely that what was presented will turn out to be a lower estimate of the ultimate numbers as retirements are processed and additional staff consider their options.

The bottom line is that, regardless of the ultimate budget passed by Congress, applicants to DOE funding programs may face delays and some frustrations as fewer staff are available to manage programs. The seniority of many of those who have taken early retirement may also present a challenge to programs operating efficiently.

Other Updates

DOE Issues Critical Materials RFI: DOE issued a request for information (RFI) seeking public input from energy stakeholders to inform DOE's 2026 Energy Critical Materials Assessment. Specifically, DOE is seeking feedback on energy technologies of interest, materials of interest, supply chain information, market dynamics, challenges to domestic industry, methodology, critical minerals and materials lists, and other issues related to critical materials. RFI responses are due by July 25, 2025. Responses are not required for all categories or questions.

Introduction of the FOR SALE Act: On June 26, Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) introduced2173, the Federal Office Realignment and Sale of Assets for Leveraging Efficiency (FOR SALE) Act, which would sell off six properties in Washington and aim to ""generate $400 million in revenue and cut $2.9 billion in costs for overdue maintenance."" Any agency located in one of the buildings listed would have to vacate the premises and find space elsewhere within 18 months. The General Services Administration (GSA) would then sell those buildings no later than two years after those agencies leave. Properties include the James V. Forrestal Building, the site of DOE's headquarters, which was already targeted for sale back in March when GSA released a now-removed list of buildings ""marked for disposal."" Other properties include:

The Department of Agriculture South Building, which is part of USDA's Washington headquarters complex.

The Hubert H. Humphrey Federal Building, now serving as the Department of Health and Human Services headquarters.

The Frances Perkins Federal Building, which is the Labor Department's headquarters.

The Theodore Roosevelt Federal Building, which is the Office of Personnel Management's headquarters.

The Robert C. Weaver Federal Building, which has been home to the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

Awarded Energy Storage Projects: DOE's Office of Electricity announced three storage technologies projects that will receive $5 million each to demonstrate the ability of energy storage to support critical facilities and infrastructure during a power outage or other emergencies. The projects will receive funding through the Critical Facility Energy Resilience (CiFER) Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA), which was released in August 2024 and authorized through the Energy Act of 2020, which passed via the 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act under the first Trump administration.

NEVI Program Funding: On June 24, Judge Tana Lin, a Biden appointee, ruled that the Department of Transportation (DOT) likely violated the law by withholding ""expected and relied-upon funding"" under the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program, and was causing irreparable harm in those states by continuing to do so. She granted 13 of the 16 Democratic states' request for a preliminary injunction to block the freeze and restart the flow of funding, though she issued a seven-day stay pending an appeal by the government. The preliminary injunction did not apply to three of the plaintiffs — the District of Columbia, Minnesota, and Vermont — which Lin said failed to show ""irreparable harm that would befall them absent injunctive relief."" The ruling follows an opinion issued by the Government Accountability Office that the Trump administration violated the law by freezing the EV charger funding, which the Office of Management and Budget directed DOT to ignore in early June.

House Energy and Commerce Committee Advances 13 Grid Energy Permitting Bills: On June 25, the House Energy and Commerce Committee advanced 13 bills that include efforts aiming to promote LNG exports, promote interagency coordination for pipeline reviews, and bolster the domestic critical minerals supply chain.

Removal of NRC Commissioner: On June 16, President Trump fired US Nuclear Regulatory Commissioner Christopher Hanson. Hanson's dismissal opens a vacancy on the five-member Commission, which requires three members to meet quorum. A second vacancy looms if the US Senate fails to act on President Trump's renomination of Chairman David Wright by July 1.

One company doing exactly that is BYD Company Limited (HKEX: 1211 | OTC: BYDDY).

With record EV sales, strong profits, and real action on sustainability, the Chinese EV maker stands out. In this article, we’ll explain why BYD stock is one of the best sustainable EV stocks to buy and hold for the long term.

BYD’s New Energy Vehicles Hit a New High

In June 2025, BYD made history by selling 382,585 New Energy Vehicles (NEVs) in just one month. That’s the company’s highest monthly total ever and a 12% jump from the same time last year. While growth from May was only 0.03%, it still shows a strong and steady performance.

This sales milestone is more than a number. It proves BYD is leading the clean transportation race. As countries move toward cleaner energy and lower emissions, BYD continues to grow both at home and abroad.

BYD Builds It All—And That’s a Big Advantage

BYD, aka “Build Your Dreams”, started as a battery company and has since grown into a global name in electric vehicles and clean energy. While many carmakers only joined the EV wave recently, BYD has been working on electric solutions for decades.

One of its biggest strengths is that it makes most of its key parts in-house. The company designs and builds its own batteries (e.g., lithium iron phosphate: LFP batteries), motors, chips, and vehicle platforms. This full control helps BYD avoid supply chain delays and cut costs, while still delivering high quality.

This setup allows the company to launch new products faster and respond quickly to market shifts. When other automakers face delays or cost jumps, BYD keeps moving due to its strong in-house system.

Furthermore, the EV giant is aggressively expanding its global footprint across the U.S., Hungary, Brazil, and Thailand. Its EVs are reaching customers in Europe, Southeast Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East.

Today, exports make up about 20% of BYD’s NEV sales. As more countries push for cleaner vehicles and tighter emissions rules, BYD is well-positioned to meet that demand.

Driving Toward Net Zero: BYD’s Carbon Commitment

The company aims to cut its carbon intensity by 50% by 2030 and become carbon neutral by 2045. It’s already working on this goal by switching to renewable energy and improving factory efficiency.

BYD revealed,

“As of 10 March, 2025, BYD has counterbalanced 86,874,386,498 kg of CO₂, equivalent to the CO₂ absorption of 1,447,906,442 trees”

BYD’s 2024 sustainability report outlines major efforts, including:

Using 35% green electricity by 2025

Expanding solar power use across its plants

Producing only zero-emission vehicles

Recycling batteries and finding second-life uses for them

By investing in both clean vehicles and green manufacturing, BYD is creating a full-circle sustainable business model.

Solar and Battery Storage Push

BYD isn’t only about vehicles. It also plays a key role in the solar energy and battery storage industries. The company builds everything from solar wafers to full PV modules, offering complete systems for homes, businesses, and power grids.

A recent deal with Saudi Electricity Company shows just how far BYD has come. The two companies signed a contract to build the world’s largest grid-scale energy storage project, with a capacity of 12.5 GWh. That brings their total collaboration in Saudi Arabia to 15.1 GWh—a major win for both BYD and the country’s Vision 2030 goals.

This move highlights BYD’s growing role in the global energy market, beyond just transportation.

Competing and Winning in a Tough EV Market

The EV space is crowded, with companies like Tesla, NIO, and legacy automakers all in the mix. But BYD stands out by growing steadily, even during price wars and economic uncertainty.

Its strong supply chain and smart pricing strategies help the company stay competitive. When others cut prices to chase market share, BYD keeps its margins by relying on its low-cost, in-house production model.

BYD’s ability to adapt quickly to changes in policies, markets, and supply trends shows just how solid its game plan is.

Analysts Say BYD Stock Is a Long-Term Winner

Despite global challenges, BYD’s numbers look strong. As of mid-2025, its market value reached HK$359.45 billion. The company expects 16% sales growth this year, with revenue possibly hitting HK$1.4 trillion.

Earnings per share (EPS) are also climbing. Analysts predict an average EPS of HK$7.20, which is higher than last year. Out of 115 analysts, 106 have rated BYD as a “Buy” or “Strong Buy”—a clear sign of confidence in its future.

Experts believe BYD’s stock has room to grow over the next decade and beyond, and the price projections reflect the company’s ongoing research, innovation, and international growth plans.

Beyond EVs: BYD’s Bigger Vision

BYD isn’t just building electric cars. It also makes electric buses, trucks, and even monorail systems. Its SkyRail, a driverless monorail, is already in use in several cities, offering clean urban transit options.

Its all-in-one approach, making batteries, building cars, producing solar panels, and supporting the energy grid, provides a solid base for future growth.

If investors are looking for a stock that blends smart innovation, global reach, and real climate impact, BYD is a top choice. It’s not just about profits, it’s about progress. And BYD is clearly driving both.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/shutterstock_2414551961.jpg,N,,2025-07-04 22:06:12.546911

Flanked by Republican legislators and members of his Cabinet, Trump signed the multitrillion-dollar legislation outside the White House, and then banged down the gavel that House Speaker Mike Johnson gifted him that was used during the bill's final passage Thursday.

Against odds that at times seemed improbable, Trump achieved his goal of celebrating a historic — and divisive — legislative victory in time for the nation's birthday. Fighter jets and a stealth bomber streaked through the sky over the annual White House Fourth of July picnic as Trump and first lady Melania Trump stepped out onto the White House balcony.

“America's winning, winning, winning like never before,” Trump said, noting last month's bombing campaign against Iran's nuclear program, which he said the flyover was meant to honor. “Promises made, promises kept and we've kept them.”

The White House was hung with red, white and blue bunting for the regular Fourth of July festivities. The United States Marine Band played patriotic marches — and, in a typical Trumpian touch, tunes by 1980s pop icons Chaka Khan and Huey Lewis. The two separate flyovers bookended Trump’s appearance and the band playing the national anthem.

Democrats assailed the package as a giveaway to the rich that will rob millions more lower-income people of their health insurance, food assistance and financial stability.

""I never thought that I’d be on the House floor saying that this is a crime scene,” Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said during a record-breaking speech that delayed the bill's passage by eight-plus hours. “It’s a crime scene, going after the health, and the safety, and the well-being of the American people.”

The legislation extends Trump’s 2017 multitrillion-dollar tax cuts and cuts Medicaid and food stamps by $1.2 trillion. It provides for a massive increase in immigration enforcement. Congress’ nonpartisan scorekeeper projects that nearly 12 million more people will lose health insurance under the law.

The legislation passed the House on a largely party-line vote Thursday, culminating a monthslong push by the GOP to cram most of its legislative priorities into a single budget bill that could be enacted without Senate Democrats being able to block it indefinitely by filibustering.

It passed by a single vote in the Senate, where North Carolina Republican Thom Tillis announced he would not run for reelection after incurring Trump’s wrath in opposing it. Vice President JD Vance had to cast the tie-breaking vote.

In the House, where two Republicans voted against it, one, conservative maverick Tom Massie of Kentucky, has also become a target of Trump’s well-funded political operation.

The legislation amounts to a repudiation of the agendas of the past two Democratic presidents, Barack Obama and Joe Biden, in rolling back Obama’s Medicaid expansion under his signature health law and Biden’s tax credits for renewable energy.

The Congressional Budget Office estimates the package will add $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the decade and 11.8 million more people will go without health coverage.

Trump exulted in his political victory Thursday night in Iowa, where he attended a kickoff of events celebrating the country's 250th birthday next year.

“I want to thank Republican congressmen and women, because what they did is incredible,” he said. The president complained that Democrats voted against the bill because “they hate Trump — but I hate them, too.”

The package is certain to be a flashpoint in next year's midterm elections, and Democrats are making ambitious plans for rallies, voter registration drives, attack ads, bus tours and even a multiday vigil, all intended to highlight the most controversial elements.

Upon his return to Washington early Friday, Trump described the package as “very popular,” though polling suggests that public opinion is mixed at best.

For example, a Washington Post/Ipsos poll found that majorities of U.S. adults support increasing the annual child tax credit and eliminating taxes on earnings from tips, and about half support work requirements for some adults who receive Medicaid.

But the poll found majorities oppose reducing federal funding for food assistance to low-income families and spending about $45 billion to build and maintain migrant detention centers. About 60% said it was “unacceptable” that the bill is expected to increase the $36 trillion U.S. debt by more than $3 trillion over the next decade.

The facility is expected to provide reliable, sustainable, and affordable electricity to more than 430,000 people in rural areas of Tajikistan and northern Afghanistan.

The project aims to reduce electricity interruptions caused by natural disasters, support local employment, and generate income for surrounding communities. The inauguration ceremony was led by the President of Tajikistan, Emomali Rahmon, and attended by international development partners.

European Commissioner for International Partnerships Jozef Síkela said: “The Sebzor hydropower plant, in line with the EU’s Global Gateway investment strategy, is a great illustration of how a sustainable infrastructure project transforms a whole region. It strengthens energy security, unlocks opportunities for local communities and businesses, promotes economic growth, and protects people’s health and the environment. I was privileged to visit Tajikistan this year and could see the potential for our deeper partnership, bringing added value, win-win solutions and building stronger connections between both regions.”

Located at an altitude of over 2,500m in Roshtqala District, the Sebzor hydropower plant is a run-of-river facility with an installed capacity of 11MW. It can produce over 76 million kilowatt-hours of renewable electricity annually and is expected to prevent more than 45,000 metric tons of CO₂ emissions per year. The plant is grid-synchronized to improve electricity reliability in the region and support power exports to northern Afghanistan.

The Sebzor project is part of the EU’s Team Europe Initiative on Water, Energy and Climate Change. Tajikistan, while rich in water resources, faces challenges in managing them amid growing climate-related risks. The project aligns with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards and is the first in the world to be certified under the Hydropower Sustainability Standard.

As part of the broader project, a new secondary school for 240 students was inaugurated in the Barjangal settlement. A Livelihood Restoration Program is also included, supporting entrepreneurship, community infrastructure, and education as part of the project’s Resettlement Action Plan.

Sebzor was jointly financed under the Team Europe approach by the German government and the European Union through the KfW Development Bank. It was implemented by Pamir Energy.

In addition to the Sebzor plant, two key rural electrification projects were launched:

The commissioning of the 110/35/10 kV Jangal Substation in Rushan District and a 53 km double circuit transmission line between Khorog and Vomar.

The ground-breaking of the 110/35 kV Qozideh Substation in Ishkashim District and a 42 km double circuit line between Vomar and Voznavd in Rushan District.

These projects are expected to deliver electricity to approximately 300,000 people, as well as local public services and businesses, while reducing costs.

We’ve seen the billions of dollars in clean energy investments flowing into nearly every state in recent years, creating job opportunities in communities where they’re needed most, at a time when the U.S. needs even more wind, solar and battery storage to meet growing demand. Yet the President and his allies decided to pull back the tax credits that were making these good things happen.",https://www.edf.org/themes/edf2020/favicons/favicon-96x96.png,N,,2025-07-04 22:06:16.334820

So, there should be a big surge in EV sales this quarter, and then … boom.
Though, there’s also a common understanding that automakers’ EV programs are not making profits yet, so that seems dubious.
However … Tesla sales have been dropping and Tesla’s own profit margin has nearly collapsed.
So much for a big surge in EV sales through the end of 2025.","Two weeks ago, I wrote that the Republican plan to cut electric vehicle incentives may lead to a huge surge in EV sales through the end of the year, but that was based on the plans that had been proposed in the early stages of the bill. As it turns out, the Big Bad Budget Bill (actually named “One Big Beautiful Bill”) ended up cutting the EV tax credits much sooner. They are all ending on September 30, 2025.

So, there should be a big surge in EV sales this quarter, and then … boom. The US EV market is not likely to look very positive for a while after September 30.

Naturally, there’s an assumption some make that automakers can just lower prices once the tax incentives are gone. Though, there’s also a common understanding that automakers’ EV programs are not making profits yet, so that seems dubious. Some Tesla fans think this will actually end up benefitting Tesla — because, presumably, if other automakers have a harder time lowering prices and making sales than Tesla, the EV-only automaker could gain a big advantage in the market again. However … Tesla sales have been dropping and Tesla’s own profit margin has nearly collapsed. So, I don’t think Tesla has the space in its bank account to cut prices itself, and certainly not significantly. More likely than not, Tesla will also be hit and will see its sales drop, perhaps to a truly concerning degree in the US.

We will see how this plays out, but as of now, this looks like very bad news. So much for a big surge in EV sales through the end of 2025.

One has to wonder how Elon Musk is going to respond and act if Tesla sales do drop significantly (more than they already are) in the US as a result of this policy change.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Charging-Tesla-Model-3-S-X-Fleet-Red-White-Blue-Supercharging-Florida-National-Drive-Electric-Week-Metro-watermark.jpeg,N,,2025-07-04 19:08:33.391963

The bill, which cleared the House by a 218-214 vote after Vice President JD Vance broke a tie in the Senate on Tuesday, eliminates major clean energy incentives, including tax credits for electric vehicles and home energy efficiency upgrades.

While the Senate ultimately dropped a last-minute excise tax on wind and solar -- a measure experts had warned would have been a ""killer"" for the industry -- the final bill still delivers a major blow to renewable energy. Under the bill, key tax incentives for wind, solar and other clean energy projects will be phased out by 2027, with tighter conditions imposed for those seeking to claim them.

""It came as a complete shock,"" said Jason Grumet, chief executive of the American Clean Power Association, which represents renewable energy producers.

The new tax ""is so carelessly written and haphazardly drafted that the concern is it will create uncertainty and freeze the markets,"" Grumet was quoted by the New York Times as saying.

Grumet is among many industry analysts warning that the bill could deal a major blow to the U.S. clean energy transition, undermining investment confidence, stalling innovation and jeopardizing long-term job growth in the sector.

For example, the American Clean Power Association called the legislation a ""step backward for American energy policy,"" cautioning that it could eliminate jobs and drive up electricity costs.

According to projections from Energy Innovation and researchers at Wellesley College's Environmental Studies Department, the bill threatens 4,500 clean energy projects, puts hundreds of thousands of jobs at risk, and could add billions of dollars to Americans' annual energy bills within five years, Newsweek reported.

Meanwhile, electric vehicle makers also stand to lose. Before the bill's passage, new electric vehicles were eligible for a 7,500 U.S. dollar federal tax credit, while used EVs could qualify for a credit of up to 4,000 dollars. Those incentives were originally designed to help make the vehicles more affordable.

The bill runs counter to global green transition efforts, dealing a blow not only to America's clean energy sector but to global sustainability at large. While domestic backlash has been swift, the bill is also raising concerns abroad, particularly over its potential to undermine international clean energy cooperation and climate commitments.

""Emissions will increase significantly,"" said Robbie Orvis, senior director of modeling and analysis at the climate policy think tank Energy Innovation.

""There will be less clean energy deployed, replaced by a mix of gas and coal in the power sector,"" Orvis was quoted by Scientific American as saying on Thursday, which noted that the United States is the world's second-largest greenhouse gas emitter and the biggest historical contributor to climate change.

The broader implications of the bill have also sparked sharp criticism from environmental advocates.

""It's clear that this deeply unpopular bill favors burning more fossil fuels while ignoring the damage it will do to people's lives,"" said Joanna Slaney, vice president for political and government affairs for the Environmental Defense Fund.

As the House now sends the bill to Trump's desk, environmental groups are turning their attention to the next stage of the fight.

“We started our company in 1980, and we’ve been, you know, progressing with solar pool heating, solar water heating, solar electricity,” Murray said. “And now, we thought the next step was EVs.""

As a medium-sized business with 49 employees, Murray said his new fleet of six EV work vehicles, that each cost $120,000, wouldn’t have been possible without help.

“You see Fedex out there and Amazon with these vehicles, they can afford it,” Murray said. “We can’t [afford them] without the special treatment that we get from Mitra and the Air Quality Board and Smud, the local utility. They’re all giving us help and rebates to get these things.”

The three companies Murray mentioned utilize state and federal clean energy incentives, but the majority of that federal support is gone under President Donald Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill.

The president calling green tax credits a scam.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune reiterated Republicans’ focus on fossil fuels over renewable energy.

“The Biden administration took us down the wrong path,” Thune said. “That restricted development of Americans conventional energy resources, and imposed regulations that heap new burdens and costs on conventional energy producers.”

Most tax credits for large wind and solar projects will end in 2028, with residential solar credits ending this year and EV credits by September.

UC Davis economist Colin Murphy, who focuses on clean energy, explained that government incentives made clean tech cheaper and warns that fossil fuels are finite, so a shift to renewables is inevitable.

“It can’t stop EVs from taking over,” Murphy said. “It can’t stop wind and solar from increasing deployment globally. But it can slow it down quite a bit. And that is a problem because if fully mature economies like the US don’t decarbonize by mid-century. We have no chance of averting the worst impacts.”

Murphy added that the argument of renewable energy being unreliable compared to fossil fuels is an outdated issue.

“Ten, 20 years ago, the argument on solar was you only get power during the day,"" he said. “But now, grid scale lithium ion batteries are cheap enough [which can store very large quantities of power to utilize at anytime].”

There are still incentives for nuclear and bio fuels in the “Big Beautiful Bill,” but Murphy said those energy sources come with climate issues such as nuclear waste and land clearing for bio fuels.

Murphy added by slowing down research and development on solar, wind and EV technology, the U.S. was allowing China to further become the market leader it already is in manufacturing and creating more advanced technology of this type.

Range anxiety for EV work vehicles has also been an argument against credits for such programs, but Murray said his get close to 300 miles, which is more than enough. And he’s already seen big cost savings.

“I just saw the bill for the electricity to charge these [work vehicles] was $600 a month,” Murray said. “We were paying probably $4,000 for gas [in our old] vehicles. So, the savings are substantial.”

This legislative shift, prioritizing fossil fuels over clean innovation, underscores a pivotal moment for international climate action and investment.

Key Contentions of the ""Big Beautiful Bill""

The OBBBA directly targets the advancements made by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), threatening to undo progress with severe economic and environmental consequences. The primary points of contention include:

Financial Disincentives: The bill seeks to eliminate billions in clean energy tax credits for wind, solar, electric vehicles (EVs), and energy-efficient appliances. Specifically, a new excise tax on wind and solar projects could increase consumer energy prices by 8% to 10% and cost clean energy businesses an additional $4-$7 billion by 2036. This aims to accelerate the timeline for ending existing tax credits, potentially by 2027.

Devastating Impact on Projects & Jobs: The implications for the U.S. clean energy sector are stark. Analysts warn that the OBBBA ""threatens 4,500 clean energy projects, putting hundreds of thousands of jobs at risk."" It could lead to a loss of 840,000 jobs in renewable energy deployment and clean technology manufacturing by 2030, and potentially kill up to 72% of new wind and solar installations over the next decade.

Rising Energy Costs: By promoting fossil fuels and removing incentives for cleaner alternatives, the legislation is projected to raise household energy costs for Americans by an estimated $250 to $415 more per year by 2035.

Global Competitiveness at Risk: Experts have called the bill ""a truly bizarre, a self-defeating measure"" that will lead to ""less investment in American energy production and less confidence in the American business environment,"" potentially ceding leadership in advanced clean technology to nations like China.

The Ripple Effect: Implications for ASEAN and Singapore

While the OBBBA primarily impacts the U.S. domestic energy market, its effects on global clean energy supply chains, investment trends, and policy consistency can have significant indirect implications for ASEAN nations and Singapore's ambitious sustainability goals.

For ASEAN:

U.S. policy shifts, including tariffs on solar imports from Southeast Asia, highlight the urgent need for regional self-reliance and diversification.

Trade Uncertainty & Domestic Opportunity: High U.S. tariffs (some as high as 3,521%) on solar imports from Southeast Asia necessitate that ASEAN countries prioritize domestic renewable energy projects and diversify their energy mixes. Paradoxically, the global oversupply of low-cost solar components, largely from China, could find a new market in ASEAN, potentially accelerating regional deployment.

Financing Challenges: The U.S. withdrawal from initiatives like the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) could leave a significant gap in green financing for countries like Indonesia (up to USD 2 billion) and Vietnam (up to USD 1 billion), disrupting their energy transition plans.

Increased Reliance on China: With reduced U.S. engagement in climate leadership, ASEAN may find itself increasingly reliant on China, a dominant force in clean technology manufacturing, for its clean energy needs.

Investment Confidence: Uncertainty stemming from U.S. policy could dampen overall investor confidence in renewable energy across ASEAN, a region that already faces challenges with grid infrastructure, regulatory frameworks, and insufficient investment. ASEAN needs an estimated USD 27 billion annually in renewable energy investment to meet its target of 23% renewables in primary energy supply by 2025.

For Singapore:

Singapore's commitment to its Green Plan 2030 remains strong, yet it is not entirely immune to global shifts.

Solar Ambitions: Singapore aims to quadruple its solar energy deployment by 2025 and achieve at least 2 Gigawatt-peak (GWp) of solar energy by 2030, intending to meet approximately 3% of its projected electricity demand.

Indirect Supply Chain & Cost Impacts: Disruptions to global clean energy supply chains or an increase in the cost of renewable technologies due to U.S. policies could indirectly affect Singapore's ability to procure necessary components, potentially increasing the cost of achieving its solar and other green targets.

Innovation & Partnerships: A slowdown in U.S. clean energy innovation might mean fewer advanced technologies are available globally. However, Singapore's strategic positioning and ongoing private sector investments by U.S. tech giants in its green infrastructure could partially offset these challenges.

Implications for 2030 Targets

The ""Big Beautiful Bill"" and similar policies that undermine renewable energy have direct and indirect consequences for 2030 climate and energy targets:

U.S. 2030 Targets: The bill would severely hinder the U.S.'s ability to meet its own climate goals and renewable energy deployment targets by 2030, likely resulting in a significant shortfall of clean energy installations and an increased reliance on fossil fuels.

ASEAN 2030 Targets: For ASEAN, U.S. policy inconsistencies could make it harder to achieve its renewable energy targets by introducing financial and supply chain uncertainties. This underscores the need for robust national policies and regional cooperation to drive the energy transition.

Singapore 2030 Targets: Singapore's ambitious targets, such as quadrupling solar deployment and mandating cleaner-energy vehicles by 2030, are internal. However, global market shifts influenced by major economies like the U.S. could affect the cost and availability of technologies, potentially making the pathway to these goals more challenging.

In conclusion, the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" represents a significant setback for clean energy in the U.S., with a cascading effect that could impact global efforts. While ASEAN and Singapore are actively pursuing their own green agendas, the broader implications highlight the interconnectedness of climate action and the need for resilient, diversified strategies to navigate evolving geopolitical and economic landscapes.",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQF7PjJT8SeUUg/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/B56ZfT2.4fHUAg-/0/1751606102182?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=kDwjbG2351InAB74eJsSCpbKR4VXq6kHw-jRkjPRdGk,N,,2025-07-04 20:07:35.454813

While the Senate ultimately dropped a last-minute excise tax on wind and solar -- a measure experts had warned would have been a ""killer"" for the industry -- the final bill still delivers a major blow to renewable energy. Under the bill, key tax incentives for wind, solar and other clean energy projects will be phased out by 2027, with tighter conditions imposed for those seeking to claim them.

""It came as a complete shock,"" said Jason Grumet, chief executive of the American Clean Power Association, which represents renewable energy producers.

The new tax ""is so carelessly written and haphazardly drafted that the concern is it will create uncertainty and freeze the markets,"" Grumet was quoted by the New York Times as saying.

Grumet is among many industry analysts warning that the bill could deal a major blow to the U.S. clean energy transition, undermining investment confidence, stalling innovation and jeopardizing long-term job growth in the sector.

For example, the American Clean Power Association called the legislation a ""step backward for American energy policy,"" cautioning that it could eliminate jobs and drive up electricity costs.

According to projections from Energy Innovation and researchers at Wellesley College's Environmental Studies Department, the bill threatens 4,500 clean energy projects, puts hundreds of thousands of jobs at risk, and could add billions of dollars to Americans' annual energy bills within five years, Newsweek reported.

Meanwhile, electric vehicle makers also stand to lose. Before the bill's passage, new electric vehicles were eligible for a 7,500 U.S. dollar federal tax credit, while used EVs could qualify for a credit of up to 4,000 dollars. Those incentives were originally designed to help make the vehicles more affordable.

The bill runs counter to global green transition efforts, dealing a blow not only to America's clean energy sector but to global sustainability at large. While domestic backlash has been swift, the bill is also raising concerns abroad, particularly over its potential to undermine international clean energy cooperation and climate commitments.

""Emissions will increase significantly,"" said Robbie Orvis, senior director of modeling and analysis at the climate policy think tank Energy Innovation.

""There will be less clean energy deployed, replaced by a mix of gas and coal in the power sector,"" Orvis was quoted by Scientific American as saying on Thursday, which noted that the United States is the world's second-largest greenhouse gas emitter and the biggest historical contributor to climate change.

The broader implications of the bill have also sparked sharp criticism from environmental advocates.

""It's clear that this deeply unpopular bill favors burning more fossil fuels while ignoring the damage it will do to people's lives,"" said Joanna Slaney, vice president for political and government affairs for the Environmental Defense Fund.

As the House now sends the bill to Trump's desk, environmental groups are turning their attention to the next stage of the fight.

""We know that in the fight for clean air and clean water and a healthy environment that we can't afford to stop fighting,"" David Shadburn, legislative director at the League of Conservation Voters, told Inside Climate News. ""So we're going to keep doing that, and we know that the public is on our side.""

This is because it is highly dependent on the U.S. market and is already under pressure to increase costs due to tariffs on each item. On the other hand, the semiconductor and battery industries are also cautiously revealing their expectations.

The bill calls for early abolition of all tax credits given to purchases of electric vehicles under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The benefits were originally expected to remain in place until 2032, but the passage of the bill pushed the deadline to September 30 this year.

Hyundai Motor Group sold about 120,000 electric vehicles in the U.S. last year, ranking second in the electric vehicle market after Tesla. If the tax benefits of $7,500 per vehicle that these vehicles could have received are calculated based on last year's sales, it is about $900 million (about 1.2 trillion won).

The 25% impact of tariffs on each automobile item, which took effect in early April, also remains. Hyundai Motor Group maintains a price freeze, but the industry expects that its spare inventory in the U.S. will run out early this month. After that, the company has to raise the price or bear all the customs costs.

""For now, there seems to be little positive effect from the operation of new Georgia plants other than some tariff reduction effects through rising localization rates in the U.S.,"" an industry official said. ""We will try to increase electric vehicle sales as much as possible by the prescription on September 30.""

On the other hand, the semiconductor industry is reacting with a mixture of expectations and concerns. The bill included expanding the tax credit rate given to companies from 25% to 35% when new semiconductor production facilities are created in the U.S. It is also known that it includes a support plan to allow expenses to be paid for semiconductor R&D in the United States.

The semiconductor industry said, ""It must be good news as the tax credit rate has increased,"" but added, ""We will have to watch the situation because there is no information on the details."" ""It is not clear whether the tax credits specified in the bill will be given regardless of the 'subsidies' that were already promised to receive from the former Joe Biden administration or whether other conditions will be added,"" an industry official said.

The battery industry evaluates that while forward demand is inevitable due to the abolition of subsidies for electric vehicles, key incentives such as advanced manufacturing and production tax credit (AMPC) have been maintained and made good progress. As the FEOC regulation, which checks the use of Chinese products, has been applied to the AMPC under the new name 'PFE', it is also expected that Chinese batteries will have a narrower place in the U.S. market.

Battery companies point to shrinking the electric vehicle market as the biggest risk of the tax cut. However, an industry official said, ""In addition to imposing high tariffs on Chinese batteries, the way for Chinese battery companies to receive tax credits in the U.S. is virtually blocked,"" adding, ""The competitiveness of Korean companies in North America can be relatively highlighted.""

The solar energy industry says that the reduction of investment tax credits (ITCs) for power generation projects in North America will inevitably lead to a contraction in forward demand. As incentives to power generation operators decrease, cell and module manufacturers in the U.S., such as Hanwha Q Cells and OCI Holdings, will also be hit.",https://wimg.mk.co.kr/news/cms/202507/05/news-g.v1.20250704.eec08fb34da743dca117633de95a4eb2_P1.jpg,N,,2025-07-05 05:01:01.627781

The Senate bill will now return to the House, which will vote on whether to approve the as-revised bill.

Both bills’ major business, international, individual, and exempt organization tax proposals, as well as key differences, are summarized below.

Business Tax Proposals

Increasing the Section 163(j) limitation. Both bills would increase the total interest that businesses may deduct starting in 2025 by modifying the Section 163(j) business interest expense limitation from 30% EBIT to 30% EBITDA, although the Senate bill would do so permanently while the House bill would do so only through 2029.

Preserving the PTET deduction. Unlike the House proposal to eliminate the deduction for certain state taxes paid by pass-through entities (PTET), the Senate bill preserves the PTET deduction without limitation.

Increasing the SALT deduction cap. Both bills would increase the total state and local taxes (SALT) that an itemizing taxpayer may deduct from $10,000 to up to $40,000 for individuals earning $500,000 or less. The Senate bill would increase the cap only through 2029 (i.e., reverting to $10,000 in 2030), whereas the House bill would permanently increase the cap.

Eliminating and phasing out certain energy tax credits. Both bills would eliminate consumer-facing credits for electric vehicles and home efficiency upgrades as well as curtail certain other energy tax credits introduced by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The Senate bill would modify the eligibility timeline for the tech-neutral investment tax credit (“ITC”) and production tax credit (“PTC”) by requiring either that wind and solar projects begin construction within 12 months of enactment of the budget bill or otherwise be placed into service before 2028. By contrast, the House bill would require wind and solar projects to begin construction within 60 days of the bill’s enactment—a tight timeline that drew backlash from investors who had expected these credits to be available much longer.

Extending the Clean Fuel Production Credit. The bills would extend the credit through 2029 (Senate) or 2031 (House).

Reinstating the TCJA’s 100% bonus depreciation. Both bills would reinstate the TCJA’s 100% bonus depreciation for certain property acquired and placed in service after January 19, 2025, although the Senate bill would do so permanently while the House bill would do so only through 2029.

Introducing a new 100% bonus depreciation provision for certain nonresidential real property. Both bills introduce a new provision providing for 100% bonus depreciation for nonresidential real property connected to certain agricultural or chemical manufacturing and production activities, provided that (i) construction begins between January 20, 2025 and December 31, 2029, and (ii) the property is put into service before 2031 (Senate) or 2033 (House).

Immediate expensing for domestic R&D. Both bills would allow immediate expensing of domestic R&D costs incurred from 2025 onward, although the Senate bill would do so permanently and the House bill would do so only through 2029. The Senate bill would also apply retroactively for R&D expenses incurred during 2022 through 2024 by allowing certain small business taxpayers to claim a full deduction in the expense year, and other taxpayers to immediately expense any remaining amortization.

Extending the Section 199A pass-through entity tax deduction. Both bills would permanently extend the TCJA’s Section 199A pass-through entity tax deduction on qualified business income, although the House bill would further increase the deduction from 20% to 23% of such income.

Clarifying Section 707(a)(2). Both bills would clarify that the partnership rules applicable to disguised sales and disguised payments for services are self-executing in the absence of regulations, as discussed further here.

Partially excluding certain agricultural loan interest income. Under only the Senate bill, banks could exclude from their gross income 25% of interest on certain loans secured by rural or agricultural property and incurred after the enactment date.

Modifying the REIT rules. Both bills would increase the total amount of Taxable REIT Subsidiary (“TRS”) stock that a REIT can hold from 20% to 25%.

Increasing the Low-Income Housing Credit. Both bills would increase the Low-Income Housing Credit by allowing states to issue more tax credits, and increasing credits for properties financed by tax-exempt bonds, although the Senate bill would do so permanently, and the House bill would do so only from 2026 through 2029.

Increasing the Section 179 limitation on expensing certain depreciable business assets. The Senate bill would permanently increase the Section 179 limitation from $2.5 million to an inflation-adjusted $4 million, and the House bill would only increase the limitation through 2029.

International Tax Proposals

Eliminating the Section 899 Revenge Tax. Unlike the House bill, the Senate bill omits Section 899, the so-called “revenge tax” that would have targeted investors from countries that impose taxes considered “unfair” to U.S. taxpayers and their subsidiaries. The omission follows the recent G-7 agreement in principle to exempt U.S.-based multinationals from certain taxes under Pillar 2 of the OECD BEPS project that were the principal “unfair” taxes targeted by earlier drafts of Section 899.

Increasing the GILTI, FDII, and BEAT tax rates. As compared to the House bill, the Senate bill would further increase the currently effective rates on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) from 10.5% to 14%, on Foreign Derived Intangible Income (FDII) from 13.125% to 14%, and on the Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT) from 10% to 10.5%.

Modifying the CFC rules. Unlike the House bill, the Senate bill would modify the controlled foreign corporation (CFC) rules by (i) permanently extending the CFC look-through rule, (ii) restoring the limitation for applying downward attribution from a foreign person to a U.S. person when determining CFC status, and (iii) revising the calculation of a U.S. shareholder’s pro rata share of subpart F income.

Individual Tax Proposals

Preserving the TCJA’s tax rates. Both bills would permanently extend the TCJA’s tax rates with a 37% top marginal tax rate.

Permanently eliminating the personal exemption and various itemized deductions. Both bills would permanently eliminate the personal exemption and various itemized deductions, including miscellaneous itemized deductions, deductions for casualty losses (other than from federally or state declared disasters), and moving expense deductions.

Limiting excess business losses. Both bills would permanently limit a non-corporate taxpayer’s ability to claim excess business loss deductions.

Increasing the estate and gift tax exemption. Both bills would increase the exemption to an inflation-adjusted $15 million.

Limiting AMT. Both bills would permanently extend the limitations on the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), including the increased exemption from, and the increased income threshold for phasing out the exemption to, the AMT.

Limiting mortgage interest deductions. Both bills would permanently limit mortgage interest deductions to the first $750,000 of mortgage indebtedness, and eliminate interest deductions on home equity indebtedness.

Limiting charitable contribution deductions for itemizing taxpayers. Unlike the House bill, the Senate bill would disallow charitable contribution deductions for itemizing individuals to the extent that their annual contributions were less than or equal .5% of their contribution base (generally their adjusted gross income).

Expanding charitable contribution deductions for non-itemizing taxpayers. Both bills would allow non-itemizing taxpayers to deduct (in addition to their standard deduction) charitable contributions by up to $2,000 (Senate) or $300 (House).

Deducting auto loan interest. Both bills would permanently allow certain taxpayers, subject to an income phaseout, to deduct interest on loans secured by cars produced in the United States.

Retaining the TCJA’s standard deduction. Both bills would permanently extend the TCJA’s increased standard deduction.

President Trump just signed a deeply unpopular law passed by congressional Republicans — one that could thwart unprecedented American progress on clean energy and transportation.

New polling shows that 67% of voters oppose the bill when they learn what’s in it. But the law puts the U.S. on a more expensive, more dangerous, and more harmful path, threatening $980 billion in gross domestic product and taking away 900,000 good-paying jobs in energy and manufacturing alone. Sean McGarvey, president of North America’s Building Trades Unions, said, “This stands to be the biggest job-killing bill in the history of this country.”

The law includes many harmful provisions that will needlessly raise household energy costs, destabilize grid reliability at a time of increasingly extreme weather, stifle new development, take choices away from American consumers and imperil everyone’s health and safety. The law would have been irresponsible in the 1950s. In 2025, there is nothing beautiful about it. It’s self-destructive, akin to pilots switching off an engine in the middle of a flight.

Throttling Clean Energy

The law axes tax credits for reliable, affordable wind and solar energy, despite America’s record-breaking demand for power, targeting the fast-growing industry and complicating the development of new projects and good-paying jobs that are exciting the next generation of workers. Clean energy made up 95% of the capacity added to the grid last year. Eliminating the credits could reduce the amount of new, clean capacity as much as 72% in the next decade, according to the Rhodium Group.

Less electricity might make it to people’s homes — and what does could only be more expensive. Rates could spike by 16% by 2035, adding $400 every year to existing household costs by the end of the decade, other new analyses find.

The law makes it much, much harder to build new clean energy projects while old sources of energy are getting much, much more expensive. Building a new natural gas plant now takes up to 6 years. The cost has tripled. The law constrains the supply of energy — and in the middle of a heat wave — making America weaker as global competitors invest in their own clean energy economies.

Giving Handouts for Polluters

Instead, the law gives a new tax credit to coal, whose pollution causes cancer and damages children’s brains irreparably and is much more expensive and less efficient to produce than wind or solar.

It also defunds and delays the methane polluter fee, a practical, cost-effective solution based on industry’s own goals to reduce the amount of the climate-destabilizing pollutant and incentivize operators to waste less of their product. Every year, enough methane gas to meet the energy needs of 14 million homes is wasted.

The methane program, now blocked for the next 10 years, was a triple win — reducing waste, raising revenue, and keeping methane and other health-harming pollution out of the air. The delay will result in 640,000 metric tons more methane every year and cost the government $1 billion in lost revenue next year. It will cause irreversible damage to public health and safety, too, at a time when climate change is overheating the planet and intensifying the danger of life-threatening extreme weather everywhere from the Carolinas to Kentucky to California.

Hindering Choices, Harming Health

It doesn’t stop there. The law abruptly ends credits available to consumers who choose to purchase an electric or plug-in-hybrid vehicle as well as support for clean heavy-duty vehicles like freight trucks and buses. It also ends credits available to homeowners to increase their energy efficiency and add solar panels to their roofs to help lower their energy bills.

The law also cancels fines for violators of the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) program, which was established to reduce the country’s dependence on foreign oil and has saved Americans billions of dollars in fuel costs.

Despite the record-breaking heat and incidence of billion-dollar hurricanes, tornadoes and other climate disasters, the law took away the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, a $27 billion program that was helping finance projects to reduce climate and air pollution across the U.S., as well as canceled grants that were upgrading air monitoring equipment and measuring air quality at schools. The law also ended grants through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration helping to protect and prepare coastlines and fisheries for extreme weather and improve weather forecasts and communication with the American people.

After months of intense back-and-forth negotiations, on-the-floor haggling and threats to tank the legislation, Republicans’ massive tax and spending bill is heading to President Donald Trump’s desk to become law.

The wide-ranging megabill is the vehicle for much of Trump’s domestic policy agenda for his second term in the White House, with major changes in health care, immigration and tax policy that are sure to touch nearly every American. Here are the major ways Texas will be affected.

ACA and Medicaid

Over 300,000 Texans could lose their health insurance once the Medicaid changes passed by Congress take effect in 2027.

Medicaid, a federal-state health insurance program for low-income and disabled people, insures over 4 million Texans. The federal government paid for nearly two-thirds of the program’s $57 billion costs in Texas during the 2023 fiscal year, according to KFF, a nonprofit health policy organization. Using estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, KFF projects that Texas stands to lose 10% of its federal Medicaid funds over the next decade, or $39 billion.

The cuts could be particularly potent in the Rio Grande Valley, which has an outsized number of Medicaid recipients, and in rural areas, where hospitals rely on Medicaid payments. Texas already has the highest uninsured rate in the nation.

Beyond Medicaid, the bill makes it harder to enroll in coverage through Affordable Care Act marketplaces and allows for the expiration of Biden-era enhanced premium tax credits that lower out-of-pocket costs for people with ACA marketplace coverage. Because Texas is among the 10 states that have never expanded Medicaid under the ACA, its residents rely heavily on marketplace coverage and the soon-to-expire tax credits.

Taken together, KFF estimates that the megabill’s provisions will lead to 1.7 million Texans losing their coverage, adding to the nearly 5 million children and adults under 65 who currently lack health insurance.

The GOP megabill also imposes nationwide work requirements on Medicaid for the first time in the program’s history. Recipients between the ages of 19 and 64 — except for those with disabilities or with dependent children under 14 — will have to prove they are working or in school for 80 hours per month. In states that implemented work requirements under a program from Trump’s first term, enrollment dropped precipitously, including among people who were working or qualified for an exception but struggled to document it.

Texas Health and Human Services will be responsible for designing and enforcing work requirements that comply with the new federal law.

Before the Senate passed the bill this week, Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said in a floor speech that the work requirements would strengthen Medicaid for its intended recipients — children, the disabled and pregnant women.

“It’s not fair to the taxpayer to have them subsidize people sitting on the couch playing video games all day when they can contribute to their community and their family,” he said.

Texas Democrats have homed in on Medicaid cuts as the most devastating portion of the bill.

“You’re talking about a health care disaster that is going to take place — not just in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, but in every major metropolitan area in the state,” said Rep. Marc Veasey, D-Fort Worth. “When you add that on top of the rural hospitals that are going to close and the smaller areas in Texas, it’s going to create a health care nightmare scenario.”

SNAP

The Republican bill also includes deep cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, previously known as food stamps.

But the size of Texas’ SNAP cut is up in the air, dependent on how often the state errs in over- or underpaying benefit recipients.

Under the bill, states will have to cover a portion of SNAP benefits — which are currently paid for by the federal government in full — based on the percentage of erroneous payments made. States with an error rate under 6% will not have to share the cost, while states above that will be on the hook for escalating costs tied to their error rate.

Texas logged an error rate of 8.3% in fiscal 2024 — meaning that, had the law been in place, the state would have been responsible for 10% of the cost of SNAP benefits, or $716 million per year, according to the North Texas Food Bank.

The SNAP benefit cut is scheduled to kick in in fiscal 2028, unless Texas’ error rate falls under 6 percent. States with the highest rates of over- or underpayments — anything above 13.3% can delay the onset of the cost sharing, a last-minute provision included to win the support of Sen. Lisa Murowski, R-Alaska

In addition, Texas will now need to pay for 75% of the administrative cost of running the SNAP program, up from the current 50% rate. Feeding Texas, the statewide network of food banks, estimates that the new arrangement will cost the state $89.5 million annually.

Republicans also tightened SNAP work requirements in the bill. Previously, recipients over age 52 and those with children under 18 in their house were exempted from having to meet such requirements. Now, able-bodied Texans between the ages of 52 and 65 and those with children over 14 must prove they are working at least 80 hours per month to qualify for benefits.

Immigration and the border

Among the top priorities for Texas members was securing money to reimburse the state for the billions it spent on immigration enforcement along the southern border under the Biden administration. That money is now poised to flow to Texas after making it into the bill’s final draft.

Gov. Greg Abbott, who spearheaded the state’s multibillion-dollar border security program known as Operation Lone Star, has been lobbying Trump and lawmakers for federal dollars since Biden left office in January.

Texas’ GOP delegation at first pushed congressional leaders to include $12 billion in reimbursements for states that spent money on border enforcement. Cornyn secured an additional $1.5 billion in the Senate version, upping the available grants to $13.5 billion. The rules for this pot of money ensure that Texas has the largest claim to the funds of any state.

Apart from these grants, GOP lawmakers gave U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement nearly $30 billion to revamp its workforce and equipment, with the goal of speeding the agency’s rate of deportations — a hallmark Trump campaign pledge.

The reconciliation bill also puts billions into new surveillance technology and construction of a wall along the southern border.

Clean energy

The bill rolled back several key provisions of former President Joe Biden’s landmark Inflation Reduction Act, which created tax credits for clean energy projects to spur industry investment.

Those subsidies will be phased out under a provision that reserves the tax credits only for solar and wind projects that are up and running by the end of 2027. Projects that start construction within a year of the law’s enactment — including those that become operational post-2027 — also will remain eligible.

Several Republicans, including U.S. Rep. Chip Roy of Austin, wanted to see the credits abolished immediately. Roy claimed that clean energy cannot reliably power Texas’ grid, as some energy generators, such as solar panels and wind turbines, can only produce electricity in favorable weather conditions. He also said the credits subsidize foreign manufacturers whose renewable energy products dominate the American market.

Clean energy advocates say any cuts are bound to hamper the Texas labor market, as workers on renewable projects could be fired as their employers’ tax incentives disappear. With Texans’ energy demand expected to skyrocket in the next decade, supporters say clean energy could quickly and cheaply fill in the gaps.

Tax cuts

The centerpiece of the Republican megabill is the extension of an array of income tax cuts from the 2017 tax-cut package Trump signed into law during his first term.

Set to expire at the end of the year, the cuts were permanently enshrined in the bill, allowing most Americans to continue benefiting.

Republicans on the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee estimate that a family of four earning the median income in Texas — $75,780 — would have seen its tax bill rise by $1,550 if the 2017 cuts had expired and tax rates had reverted to their Obama-era levels.

Independent analyses of the bill have found that its benefits will mostly flow to the wealthy, while tax savings for the lowest earners will be largely offset by benefit cuts.

A state-by-state analysis by the Institute of Taxation and Economic Policy, a left-leaning think tank, found that the top 1% of Texans — or those making over $806,800 — will see the biggest share of the tax cuts. Those top earners will save 3.4%, or an average of $114,680 per year, on their federal income tax due to the passage of the bill.

The richest Texans will receive a larger average tax cut than their top one percent counterparts in all but two other states, according to the ITEP analysis.

Though the bill’s tax-cut provisions largely focused on preserving existing cuts, Republicans also created a host of new temporary tax relief programs aimed at workers and seniors. Texans who work in roles that traditionally receive tips will get to claim a deduction of up to $25,000 — a priority of Sen. Ted Cruz — through 2028. Those earning overtime can deduct up to $12,500 through the same time period, with lesser deductions for high earners.

And seniors can add $6,000 to their standard deduction, also through the 2028 tax year.

Trump accounts

Born out of a late-night poker game last year, Cruz championed the idea of “Trump accounts,” a provision included in the bill that will seed $1,000 in a tax-deferred investment account for nearly every child born in America in 2025 and beyond. As each recipient ages into adulthood, family, friends and nonprofits will be able to contribute up to $5,000 annually. Once they reach 18, the beneficiaries will be able to access half the funds for limited purposes — such as educational expenses, starting a small business or placing a down payment on a home. They can withdraw the rest once they reach age 31.

To accrue wealth, the account will be pegged to a broad stock index that has yet to be determined. Assuming an average market growth of 7% per year, the accounts will be worth anywhere from $3,500 to $170,000 after 18 years, depending on yearly contribution amounts.

Children born between 2025 and 2028 will be automatically enrolled in the program via their parents’ tax returns as part of the initiative’s pilot program. It is set to cost about $3 billion a year.

Cruz views the new accounts as a way to sell the next generation of American children on the free-market system.

“It gives every kid some skin in the game,” he said in an interview with The Texas Tribune earlier this month.

Pell Grant program

The megabill narrowly avoided cuts to the Pell Grant that would have devastated nearly half a million Texas students who depend on the aid to pay for college.

The House initially proposed stricter requirements to qualify for the Pell Grant, which helps cover costs for low-income students and is the largest source of grant aid in Texas. Students would have had to take more college credits each semester to get the full award, and students who are enrolled less than half-time would have lost access to the aid entirely.

In the end, the Senate stripped those changes after college access advocates sounded alarms about the educational barriers they would have raised.

The bill does prevent students from qualifying for the Pell Grant if their college already covers the full cost of attendance. Many schools across Texas offer so-called “promise programs” that cover tuition and fees after the Pell Grant kicks in.

Republicans on Capitol Hill also extended Pell Grants to short-term workforce training programs, which can last just eight to 15 weeks. Some GOP members tried to make unaccredited training programs eligible for the aid, but the proposal was quashed by the Senate parliamentarian.

Incentives for K-12 scholarships

The legislation also includes one of Cruz’s priorities: annual tax credits for people who donate to nonprofits that give scholarships to elementary and secondary school students — a framework supporters call “school choice” and that is similar to private school vouchers.

To comply with Senate parliamentary rules, Cruz’s original proposal was scaled back so it could pass the chamber with a simple majority rather than the typical 60-vote threshold needed to overcome a filibuster.

Under the provision, donors will receive a tax break equal to the amount they give to K-12 scholarship-granting organizations, including those that help students pay to attend private schools. The credit will max out at $1,700 annually, down from an earlier cap of 10% of the donor’s income, and states will get to opt in, meaning Democratic-controlled states could decline to participate.

This caveat, which was added in Senate negotiations, almost certainly sets the stage for another round of political fights in states wary of incentivizing private school attendance with public dollars.

Despite the trepidation, Cruz touted the measure repeatedly, calling school choice the “civil rights issue of the 21st century.”

Moving the Space Shuttle Discovery

Another provision secured by Cornyn requires the NASA administrator to consider moving the Space Shuttle Discovery from its current home in Virginia to the Johnson Space Center in Houston.

In 2010, the NASA Authorization Act mandated the four now-retired space shuttles be gifted to cities with ties to their orbital missions. None were allocated to Houston in what Cornyn called a political stunt by the Obama administration.

Given the city’s central role in space exploration and coordinating each of the shuttle flights, Cornyn called Houston “the cornerstone of our nation’s human space exploration program” and said it would right an “egregious wrong” to move the shuttle to Texas.

The senior Texas senator also secured an additional $10 billion in funding to support programs at the Houston space center and more money for the International Space Station and NASA’s Moon and Mars exploration program, known as Artemis.

The bill also makes cuts to food assistance programs like SNAP, something News 3 talked about with The Foodbank of Southeastern Virginia and the Eastern Shore.

“Six billion meals across the United States from the SNAP changes alone are going to put extra strain on an already-strained food bank. We’re seeing record food insecurity numbers,"" said Chris Tan, the foodbank's president and CEO.

Final Call: Buy Solar Manufacturing—Now This isn't just about energy—it's about national security.
Bottom Line: The U.S. solar boom isn't just a trend—it's a revolution.","The U.S. solar industry is undergoing a seismic shift. After years of relying on Chinese manufacturing dominance, American solar module production tripled in 2024, surging from 14.5 GW to 42.1 GW, with capacity now surpassing 50 GW in early 2025. This isn't just growth—it's a full-blown renaissance, fueled by policy tailwinds and corporate urgency. Let me break down why this is the biggest investment opportunity of the decade and where to put your money.

The Numbers Don't Lie: A Manufacturing Revolution

The SEIA Solar Market Insight Report paints a clear picture: the U.S. is now a solar superpower. Texas and Georgia lead the charge, with 8.6 GW and 8.4 GW of capacity, respectively, thanks to massive investments from firms like Hanwha Qcells and Silfab Solar. Even more critical: the U.S. reshored cell manufacturing for the first time in five years, with Suniva restarting its 1 GW Georgia plant and ES Foundry's South Carolina facility adding another 1 GW.

But here's the kicker: 28 GW of new capacity came online in 2024 alone, pushing the industry from 8 GW in 2022 to over 50 GW by early 2025. This isn't just about panels—it's about securing supply chains in a world where China still controls 70% of global polysilicon production. The U.S. is fighting back.

Why This Matters Now: Policy is the Rocket Fuel

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is the catalyst. Tax credits, manufacturing “adders,” and the CHIPS Act are throwing money at domestic solar production to slash reliance on foreign imports. Even with hiccups—like REC Silicon's Washington polysilicon plant closure—the IRA's 30% tax credit for U.S.-made modules is a game-changer.

Look at First Solar's stock: it's up 140% since 2022, riding its 10.6 GW of U.S. thin-film capacity. This isn't a fluke—it's a blueprint.

Investment Plays: The Winners and the Risks

Action Alert! Here's where to focus:

First Solar (FSLR): A leader in U.S. thin-film tech with scale and federal support. Its stock is primed to rise further as demand explodes.

Hanwha Qcells (HQCL): Its planned $2.6 billion U.S. wafer and cell factory is a direct bet on reshoring. The stock has lagged peers—now's the time to buy.

Grid Infrastructure: Solar can't hit its potential without a smarter grid. NextEra Energy (NEE), which owns the nation's largest renewable portfolio, is a must-own.

Silfab Solar: A smaller player but a pure play on cell manufacturing. If public, it'd be a top pick.

The Risks? Manageable, but Real

Critics point to polysilicon shortages and federal permitting delays. But the IRA's carrot-and-stick approach—tax incentives vs. tariffs on imports—ensures momentum. Even the Trump administration's energy emergency declarations are a sideshow; solar's demand is too strong.

The bigger risk? Waiting too long. The U.S. is on track to install 40+ GW annually by 2025, and companies that dominate manufacturing now will lock in pricing power.

Final Call: Buy Solar Manufacturing—Now

This isn't just about energy—it's about national security. The IRA's incentives mean U.S. firms can undercut Chinese imports, and with AI/data centers driving sky-high electricity demand, solar is a no-brainer.

The data's clear: firms like HQCL and FSLR are undervalued relative to their growth. Act fast—this train isn't slowing down.

Bottom Line: The U.S. solar boom isn't just a trend—it's a revolution. Get in now, or get left in the dark.

“I think that’s going to unleash American power in a way we haven’t seen in decades in the United States of America,” Vance said of the bill. “And, you know, North Dakotans, they’re the ones who are building the energy future of the United States.

“But there’s a chart I’d point you to, and it really should scare the hell out of every American. It’s if you look at the amount of power generated by the United States and the amount of power generated by the People’s Republic of China, China has produced a skyrocketing increase in energy. The United States for 30 years has been flat.

“I think the one big, beautiful bill is going to mean we start to produce more energy. That’s the key to our future as a country.”

Vance said Biden era regulations made it harder to access energy resources.

“There’s a lot of things that we’ve done through executive order, through empowering Lee Zeldin at the Environmental Protection Agency to really unleash American energy, but there are so many provisions in this bill that are going to make it easier to invest in oil and gas drilling here in the United States,” he said.

Trump was scheduled to sign the bill into law late Friday afternoon.

Vance said another key provision in the bill concerns data centers. According to the Data Foundation, the OBBB’s most significant data investments center on “data as infrastructure” — systems that prevent fraud, reduce waste, and improve program integrity.

“We want these data centers to be built by Americans and American workers and American companies,” Vance said. “These data centers have an incredible importance to the future of the economy, the artificial intelligence boom that we’re going to see over the next few years.

“It really is rooted in these data centers, impossible to build the AI economy, the future, the digital economy, the future, without these data centers, we don’t want them built by foreign countries and foreign workers. We want them built by the American people.”

The vice president was asked about Trump Accounts, created by the bill as a way to help children invest in the future. The government will make a one-time contribution of $1,000 to the accounts of children born from 2025 through 2028.

“You know, one of the things you see all across our country, unfortunately, is the rise of socialism, which we think is a very destructive ideology,” Vance said. “We think it’s going to make Americans poorer and more miserable. It’s going to mean a lot of hunger and a lot of sadness all across our country.

“But one of the things the president and I both believe in is that we really want to give people a stake in the future of the economy. The way you fight back against socialism is to make our young people feel like they have a stake in the future, and what these accounts do is actually give people from the minute they’re born, they, of course, can’t access it until they’re adults, but give them a stake in the great American economy, allow them to feel like they have a stake in the future.”

The initiatives include a 74-mile gas pipeline in Montana and three geothermal projects in Nevada, all on public lands managed by the agency.

Strategic support of geothermal projects

The approved proposal for Montana will allow NorthWestern Energy to construct an subway pipeline from Helena to Three Forks. The route will use an existing utility corridor, which will minimize its environmental impact. Construction will take place between 2026 and 2029, with preliminary studies beginning in 2025. This pipeline is part of an accelerated national strategy to respond to energy supply emergencies.

At the same time, three geothermal projects have received approval in Nevada under fast-track review processes. The first, known as Diamond Flat, seeks validation of the geothermal potential of an area near Fallon through test drilling led by Ormat Technologies. The second, McGinness Hills, will upgrade three existing power plants in Lander County by integrating technology improvements and a 15 MW solar field. The third, Pinto, will focus on exploratory studies on land near Denio to evaluate new renewable energy sources.

These developments are part of the BLM’s BLM’s commitment to responsibly manage energy resources on federal lands. With this strategy, the agency strengthens the national supply and, at the same time, promotes local employment generation and economic dynamism in rural regions. In addition, these actions align the BLM with energy transition and source diversification goals.

The approval of these projects reflects our commitment to strengthening U.S. energy independence.

Which region shows the most promising growth forecast and opportunity?

The analysis suggests that Asia-Pacific is expected to remain the largest market for EV Busbar during the forecast period. This growth outlook is majorly attributed to the following:

Asia-Pacific is the largest producer and consumer of electric vehicles, majorly driven by China. Leading Chinese EV manufacturers include BYD, SAIC, Geely, and Xpeng. Also, a major EV OEM, Tesla, has a manufacturing plant in China.

Rising infrastructure investments, strong government policies, the presence of leading EV battery and component manufacturers, and an increasing domestic consumer base of EVs are some other factors driving the demand for EV busbars in the region.

Likewise, North America is likely to experience the fastest growth during the forecast period owing to rising EV production, government incentives, and rising consumer demand.

Electric Vehicle (EV) Busbar Market Drivers:

Some of the key drivers listed in the report are given below.

Global Electric Vehicle Growth: The worldwide shift to electric cars is increasing demand for EV busbars, essential parts that distribute power efficiently in battery packs and charging systems. Government support, tougher emissions laws, and more consumer interest are boosting EV sales.

Demand for Lighter, High-Performance Power Components: EV makers want lightweight, compact, and highly conductive parts to extend driving range and improve efficiency. Busbars using advanced copper alloys and aluminum provide superior electrical performance while weighing less than conventional wire harnesses. This switch to busbars improves heat control and dependability, meeting EVs' growing power needs.

Advanced Busbar Technology and Materials: New developments like flexible busbars, laminated designs, and improved surface coatings enhance electrical flow, heat removal, and structural durability. These improvements allow busbars to manage higher electrical loads and support rapid charging systems, matching the developing EV industry requirements.

Increasing EV Charging Networks and Energy Storage: Expanding public and private charging stations, combined with renewable energy and storage system integration, is boosting busbar demand in power distribution units and battery energy storage systems. With significant government infrastructure investments (such as the US Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act), busbar use now extends from vehicles to charging stations and electrical grid systems.

Vital South and Central Texas rivers are experiencing what may be their worst droughts in recorded history. Key springs are going dry.

And in what many experts call an omen of things to come, cities and towns are beginning to fight in court over scarce reserves of groundwater.

Water fights are bigger in Texas

Meanwhile, attempts to slow the drawdown of aquifers have met opposition at the highest levels of the state. Last week, Gov. Greg Abbott (R) vetoed a bipartisan law that would have allowed a Central Texas water district above the rapidly depleting Hays-Trinity Aquifer to begin charging fees for groundwater withdrawals — something that local governments had argued was essential to avoid over-pumping by new developments.

That veto comes amid an array of water fights playing out across Texas, even as a wave of more than two-dozen new data centers are planned for water-stressed parts of the state and hundreds of thousands of new residents — on balance the most in the country — move in each year.

Amid all that are two overriding patterns: the booming economy and unchecked climate change, which together are making water into a potent and divisive political force on a hotter, drier Texas landscape.

With voters now facing a referendum that could release billions into new state water supplies, experts told The Hill, Texas faces a critical question: Can it make the necessary investments in time to keep the miracle growing — and do so without sucking the environment dry?

On the one hand, the state is “looking into the abyss,” said Rice University environmental law professor Gabriel Collins. “But what you see next to us is a partially assembled jetpack — where with a bit of tinkering we can fly out of here,” Collins said.

Facing climate change

In the Hill Country region west of Austin, rivers are at their lowest levels “since record keeping began over 100 years ago,” Charlie Hickman, executive manager of engineering with the Guadalupe Blanco River Authority, told KXAN news. In May, the Edwards Aquifer, a key source of water for San Antonio, dropped to its lowest level since the 1950s — driving local regulators to cut permitted pumping by nearly half.

Driving this dynamic is, above all, a planet heated up by the uncontrolled burning of fossil fuels, which has created a hotter, thirstier atmosphere that sucks moisture from the land, and increasingly replaces soaking rains — which replenish soil and aquifers — with torrential storms that run right off them.

Climate change has plunged the state into a new reality, said Robert Mace, director of the Meadows Center at Texas State University, a state mecca for the study of water.

In the past, Mace said, when a drought ended, people could relax. “You could say, ‘woohoo, it’s over. We’re not gonna have to do that again.’”

But now, less than a decade after the worst drought in the region’s history, “here we are back in it.” Mace added that “this is probably the new normal going forward: that we keep experiencing droughts worse than the previous drought.”

In the near term at least, that reality means shortage and conflict — at least regionally. In April, a private water supplier announced it was cutting off water supplies to nine planned developments in Central Texas; in June a municipality west of Austin considered banning bulk sales of water, a key lifeline to exurban residents whose wells have gone dry. In Montgomery County in East Texas — one of the 10 fastest-growing regions in the country — the cities of Magnolia and Conroe have halted permitting new commercial or residential wells.

‘This is a grab for water’

The downstream effects of shortages are playing out between cities as well. Last week, the city of Bryan-College Station — home of Texas A&M University — settled a lawsuit over a permit its groundwater authority had given to a landowner selling water from the aquifer to a rapidly growing suburb of Austin. Similar legal fights are playing out in Houston County and the city of Jacksonville, in East Texas.

“Folks, it’s clear what is going on,” attorney Clayton Bailey told a Jacksonville courtroom last month, per WFAA. “This is a grab for water, and it’s by a rich man who’s trying to enrich himself to the detriment of all of these good people here.”

Making the picture more difficult for cities is a 2023 state law that makes it easier for residents — or developers of subdivisions or data centers — to remove themselves from a city’s jurisdiction and tax base.

That law could allow developers of data centers or real estate to effectively secede from city authority, secure a private source of surface or groundwater, potentially impacting water availability for nearby municipalities and other private landowners.

While cities have the potential to get ahead of that problem by carefully negotiating development agreements with new entrants — effectively getting them to help fund the new civic water infrastructure they need — the prospect of the new rush “makes me so anxious for my cities,” environmental lawyer Toni Rask said.

Most of the cities and water districts she represents, Rask said, “are just tiny, and it would be easy for them to get pushed around by big fancy tech companies.”

Voters set to get a say in November

Like most experts interviewed by The Hill, Rice University’s Collins argued that while Texas towns and cities have to wake up to a new reality of drought, the state is far from running out of water — and notes that they may be about to get a huge infusion of new resources.

In November, voters will get a chance to approve what advocates have billed as a generational investment in water infrastructure — which would unlock a $20 billion public investment in new water supplies, conservation and recycling.

Once federal, local and corporate investments are added in, that’s a “meaningful bite” of the approximately $154 billion the state needs to safeguard its water supplies, said Jeremy Mazur of Texas 2036, a nonpartisan think tank focused on the state’s long-term future.

This year, Mazur said, “the legislature recognized that the water supply issue access is one of the more substantive policy issues informing the continuation of the Texas economic miracle.”

If voters approve that measure in November, a new flood of funding will pour into water projects across the state, ranging from desalination of seawater and briny water to the reuse of wastewater and the repair of leaky pipes.

The state’s towns and cities, Collins said, should think about water not in terms of something to be mined and ultimately depleted — like copper or oil — but in terms of a shifting, balanced portfolio of supplies.

The gold standard for this approach, he argued, is the city of San Antonio, which combines pumping from aquifers like the Edwards and the Carrizo-Wilcox — “the Saudi Arabia of groundwater” — with systems that stash excess river flow in underground, evaporation proof reservoirs, desalination plants for briny groundwater and “in pure volume terms the biggest recycling program in the state.”

But the state’s municipalities face significant risk if they get the calculus wrong, Collins said.

“People and companies move to Texas,” he said, because it’s “attractive” and they want to, “not because they have to.”

“And if we ever do something, have a set of circumstances emerge that changes that analysis, we will suffer for decades and generations as a result.”",https://www.ktsm.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/38/2025/07/texasdrough_04192021ap.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-07-04 21:03:17.133397

On Thursday, Republicans in the U.S. House sent a bill to President Donald Trump’s desk that kills tax credits of up to $7,500 for EV customers that were part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

The White House has said former President Joe Biden’s initiative “promised much but delivered nothing.” However, the tax credits helped fuel an EV market far more robust and affordable than drivers enjoyed before the rebates kicked in two and a half years ago. Repealing them, along with a flurry of other anti-EV policies put in place or being pursued by the Trump administration, will put a serious dent in sales.

U.S. adoption is set to trail the global average through 2040 and will knock the nation out of the top three EV markets, according to a recent BloombergNEF report. Last year’s version of the report had the country boasting higher-than-average sales starting in 2029.

Still, Elaine Buckberg, a former General Motors economist now at Harvard University’s Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability, estimates that even with federal tax cuts disappearing, some 37% of new cars bought in 2030 will be electric. That’s down from a forecast of 48% if the current incentives remained. The factors propping up some of the demand are fairly straightforward: Electric cars are far better and cheaper than they used to be, and there are many more models to choose from.

“In the most likely scenario, you end up about two years behind on adoption,” Buckberg said. ”I think [EVs] will be more resilient than people are thinking.”

The average price U.S. drivers pay for an EV has ticked slightly lower in the IRA era, from $64,700 in January 2023 to $59,900 in April, a 7.4% decline without adjusting for inflation, according to Edmunds.com. However, the range of options has widened dramatically.

When the IRA was passed, there were 34 types of EVs for sale in the U.S., with just 11 models below the average vehicle price of $47,500. Today, there are twice as many electric models to choose from, and 19 have below-average sticker prices. EV incentives in 17 states can bring the cost down even further for some buyers.

“You just have more non-luxury offerings,” Buckberg said. “You’re more likely to find the brand you want, the style you want, the size you want.”

Stephanie Valdez Streaty, a director at Cox Automotive, said carmakers and dealers are offering discounts that are often as generous or more so than government incentives. Dealer incentives on a Nissan Leaf, she said, mean “you can get that vehicle for less than $20,000” in some cases.

BNEF expects U.S. EVs will be as cheap or cheaper than gas-powered iterations by roughly 2028 (Goldman Sachs estimates that rubicon could be crossed even sooner).

There’s evidence that a majority of Americans are at least electric-curious. Nearly 60% of U.S. vehicle shoppers are “very” or “somewhat” likely to purchase an EV, according to a May JD Power survey – levels unchanged from a year ago. What’s more, concerns about purchase price and cost of ownership have declined over the past 12 months.

Still, the loss of federal incentives will hit the lower end of the market particularly hard. “The people who have the means to go buy a Rivian or a Lucid are still going to go do that,” said Ingrid Malmgren, the senior policy director at advocacy group Plug In America. “The impact, like so much of the rest of this bill, is inordinately going to be paid for by lower-income Americans.”

Rolling back EV tax credits is also only part of how the Trump administration is favoring internal combustion models. It has frozen a $5 billion federal plan to build charging stations, primarily along rural interstate corridors and in low-income communities. The White House has also promised to lower regulations on tailpipe emissions and moved to block a California policy to ban gasoline-powered car sales by 2035.

Factoring in all of these policy shifts will slow EVs’ momentum even further than the IRA cuts: BNEF forecasts that just 27% of the U.S. market to be electric by 2030, down from the 48% share it estimated a year ago, and Buckberg expects a similar slowdown.

Outside the U.S., however, EVs remain on a tear thanks to a drop in battery prices and a wave of low-price models rolling out of Chinese factories. BNEF expects one in four new cars sold this year – some 22 million cars and trucks – to come with a plug, a 25% increase over 2024. Two-thirds of those sales will be in China.",https://thumb.spokesman.com/ofZ3W_pUsr88-lKvCFSnKU6BJuQ=/1200x630/smart/media.spokesman.com/photos/2025/07/04/686831028efdb.hires.jpg,N,,2025-07-04 18:09:41.147938

The U.S. House of Representatives voted 218-214 on Thursday to pass President Donald Trump’s sweeping domestic policy bill, greenlighting deep cuts to America’s social safety net and the decimation of the country’s only federal climate strategy. Democrats uniformly opposed the bill, while all but two House Republicans supported it.

“This bill will leave America a far crueler and weaker place,” said Robert Weissman, co-president of the nonprofit Public Citizen, in a statement. It “races the United States and the world toward climate catastrophe, ending support for renewable energy that is absolutely vital to avert worst-case climate scenarios.”

The so-called Big Beautiful Bill has now been approved by both chambers of Congress; all it needs now is Trump’s signature before it can become law. Trump is expected to sign it during an evening ceremony on July 4, Independence Day, according to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt.

One of Republicans’ biggest victories in the bill is the extension of deep tax cuts enacted during Trump’s first term, which are estimated to cost the country more than $4 trillion over 10 years. The legislation also directs roughly US$325 billion to the military and to border security, while cutting nearly $1 trillion in funding for Medicaid, the joint state and federal program that covers medical costs for lower-income people.

To pay for the tax breaks, the bill sunsets clean energy tax credits that were put in place by the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, making wind and solar projects ineligible unless they start construction before July 2026 or are placed in service by 2027. It also imposes an expedited phaseout of consumer tax credits for new and used electric vehicles—by September 30 this year instead of by 2032.

Green groups described the legislation as “historically ruinous” and “a self-inflicted tragedy for our country.”

The IRA’s tax credits and additional incentives for green energy from the bipartisan infrastructure act, also passed under former president Joe Biden, were projected to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 42% by 2030. Combined with additional action from states, cities, and private companies, they could have put the U.S. on track to meet the country’s emissions reduction target under the United Nations Paris Agreement.

Once Trump signs the megabill, however, the U.S. will have no federal plan to address the climate crisis.

“Every lawmaker who voted for this cynical measure chose tax cuts for the wealthiest over Americans’ health, pocketbooks, public lands, and waters—and a safe climate. They should be ashamed,” said Manish Bapna, president of the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council, in a statement.

Agriculture experts have also objected to Trump’s policy bill, which removes the requirement that unobligated climate-targeted funds from the IRA be funneled toward climate-specific projects—in part so they can be directed toward programs under the current farm bill, an omnibus bill for food and agriculture that the federal government renews every five to six years. The Trump megabill seeks to increase subsidies to commodity farms by about $50 billion.

The final version of the bill doesn’t include a proposal to sell off millions of acres of public lands; this was dropped following outcry from the public and some conservation-minded GOP lawmakers. It also lacks stringent limits on the use of Chinese components in renewable energy projects that were proposed in an earlier version of the bill. Some Republican lawmakers in both the House and Senate voted for the legislation in exchange for carveouts in their states, like reduced work requirements for food stamps and less severe health care cuts.

In the Thursday House vote, only two Republicans broke with their party to vote against Trump’s megabill: Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who opposes measures that would increase the federal deficit, and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, who had hesitated to support cuts to Medicaid.

All Democrats voted against the bill. Immediately preceding the House vote, Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York railed against the policy in a record-breaking 8-hour-and-45-minute House floor speech invoking scripture: “Our job is to stand up for the poor, the sick, and the afflicted,” he said.

Members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus have promised to hold Republicans accountable. More than three dozen of its members have said they’ll hold “Accountability Summer” events lambasting Republican lawmakers who supported the bill. “As Democrats, we must make sure they never live that down,” the group’s chair, Greg Casar, a Democrat of Texas, said in a statement.

Similarly, Senator Brian Schatz, a Democrat for Hawaiʻi, told The New York Times that his party should use the megabill’s spending cuts as a cudgel against Republicans ahead of next year’s midterm elections: “Our job is to point out, when kids get less to eat, when rural hospitals shutter, when the price of electricity goes up, that this is because of what your Republican elected official did,” he said.

The U.S. House of Representatives voted 218-214 on Thursday to pass President Donald Trump’s sweeping domestic policy bill, greenlighting deep cuts to America’s social safety net and the decimation of the country’s only federal climate strategy. Democrats uniformly opposed the bill, while all but two House Republicans supported it.

“This bill will leave America a far crueler and weaker place,” said Robert Weissman, co-president of the nonprofit Public Citizen, in a statement. It “races the United States and the world toward climate catastrophe, ending support for renewable energy that is absolutely vital to avert worst-case climate scenarios.”

The so-called Big Beautiful Bill has now been approved by both chambers of Congress; all it needs now is Trump’s signature before it can become law. Trump is expected to sign it during an evening ceremony on July 4, Independence Day, according to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt.

One of Republicans’ biggest victories in the bill is the extension of deep tax cuts enacted during Trump’s first term, which are estimated to cost the country more than $4 trillion over 10 years. The legislation also directs roughly US$325 billion to the military and to border security, while cutting nearly $1 trillion in funding for Medicaid, the joint state and federal program that covers medical costs for lower-income people.

To pay for the tax breaks, the bill sunsets clean energy tax credits that were put in place by the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, making wind and solar projects ineligible unless they start construction before July 2026 or are placed in service by 2027. It also imposes an expedited phaseout of consumer tax credits for new and used electric vehicles—by September 30 this year instead of by 2032.

Green groups described the legislation as “historically ruinous” and “a self-inflicted tragedy for our country.”

The IRA’s tax credits and additional incentives for green energy from the bipartisan infrastructure act, also passed under former president Joe Biden, were projected to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 42% by 2030. Combined with additional action from states, cities, and private companies, they could have put the U.S. on track to meet the country’s emissions reduction target under the United Nations Paris Agreement.

Once Trump signs the megabill, however, the U.S. will have no federal plan to address the climate crisis.

“Every lawmaker who voted for this cynical measure chose tax cuts for the wealthiest over Americans’ health, pocketbooks, public lands, and waters—and a safe climate. They should be ashamed,” said Manish Bapna, president of the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council, in a statement.

Agriculture experts have also objected to Trump’s policy bill, which removes the requirement that unobligated climate-targeted funds from the IRA be funneled toward climate-specific projects—in part so they can be directed toward programs under the current farm bill, an omnibus bill for food and agriculture that the federal government renews every five to six years. The Trump megabill seeks to increase subsidies to commodity farms by about $50 billion.

The final version of the bill doesn’t include a proposal to sell off millions of acres of public lands; this was dropped following outcry from the public and some conservation-minded GOP lawmakers. It also lacks stringent limits on the use of Chinese components in renewable energy projects that were proposed in an earlier version of the bill. Some Republican lawmakers in both the House and Senate voted for the legislation in exchange for carveouts in their states, like reduced work requirements for food stamps and less severe health care cuts.

In the Thursday House vote, only two Republicans broke with their party to vote against Trump’s megabill: Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who opposes measures that would increase the federal deficit, and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, who had hesitated to support cuts to Medicaid.

All Democrats voted against the bill. Immediately preceding the House vote, Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York railed against the policy in a record-breaking 8-hour-and-45-minute House floor speech invoking scripture: “Our job is to stand up for the poor, the sick, and the afflicted,” he said.

Members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus have promised to hold Republicans accountable. More than three dozen of its members have said they’ll hold “Accountability Summer” events lambasting Republican lawmakers who supported the bill. “As Democrats, we must make sure they never live that down,” the group’s chair, Greg Casar, a Democrat of Texas, said in a statement.

Similarly, Senator Brian Schatz, a Democrat for Hawaiʻi, told The New York Times that his party should use the megabill’s spending cuts as a cudgel against Republicans ahead of next year’s midterm elections: “Our job is to point out, when kids get less to eat, when rural hospitals shutter, when the price of electricity goes up, that this is because of what your Republican elected official did,” he said.",https://www.theenergymix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/big-beautiful-bill-energy-climate-e1751649802386.webp,N,,2025-07-04 19:10:26.347540

After Trump signs it into law on the 4th of July, it also will end tax credits on buying or leasing EVs, effective Sept. 30.

Since 2008, purchasing an electric vehicle has come with an incentive: a $7,500 federal tax credit for new vehicles. The incentive was expanded in 2022 to include up to $4,000 on used EVs.

While EVs cost an average of $9,000 more than a gas-powered vehicle, not paying for gas means you’ll eventually make up the cost. Plus, the environmental impacts are well-known. However, despite the benefits of EVs, the incentive, which helped boost American sales, will soon be a thing of the past.

While the bill does away with the tax incentive, it also eliminates penalties for failing to meet Corporate Average Fuel Economy shortfalls, making it easier for automakers to build gas-powered vehicles.

On Thursday, the Electrification Coalition, an EV advocacy group, said the bill will have negative impacts on the American EV market, giving other markets like China a competitive advantage. In a July 3 statement, it warned, that “as EVs secure a growing share of the global automotive market, it is obvious that the future of transportation is electric; this bill forfeits America’s role in that future to China.” And as other markets lean into the EV market, the U.S. is already lagging behind.

Electrification Coalition Vice President of Policy Anne Blair echoed the same sentiment, saying, “Without a competitive U.S. EV industry, we will remain dependent on volatile oil markets to power our vehicles and reliant on China for the critical minerals used in most advanced technologies. We are incredibly disappointed that Congress has made a choice to entrench these vulnerabilities.”

Experts are predicting escalated sales leading up to the Sept. 30 deadline. Dan Levy, Barclays’ auto analyst, wrote in a research note, that without the incentive sales will take a steep downturn. “We believe the bill reiterates the slowdown ahead for EV penetration in the US, with both the ‘carrot’ (i.e. tax credits/incentives) and the ‘stick’ (i.e. emissions regulations) softened,” Levy said, per Reuters.","https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/p-91363601-trump-tax-bill-ev-cuts-2025.jpg",N,,2025-07-04 16:09:52.574263

With $4.6 billion in losses and 20+ lives lost, this storm has exposed the fragility of our cities and the urgency for climate resilience. Folks, the demand for flood mitigation technologies and services is about to explode. This isn't just about rebuilding—it's about reinventing how we protect our communities. And that means investors who act now could ride a tidal wave of profits.

The Texas Floods: A Wake-Up Call

The floods were a disaster multiplier. From San Antonio's record-breaking 6.11-inch rain day to the Texas Panhandle's 70-mph wind gusts, this wasn't your average storm. The damage? Catastrophic: 13 deaths, homes submerged, crops destroyed, and critical infrastructure like highways and power grids crippled. But here's the kicker—this isn't an isolated event. Texas has faced 186 billion-dollar weather disasters since 1980, and climate change is making them worse.

The rebuilding effort alone could cost billions. But this isn't just about patching potholes. It's about future-proofing against storms, heatwaves, and rising seas. The question is: Who's ready to profit from this $4.6 billion opportunity—and the next one?

Why Flood Mitigation is the New Gold Rush

The floods have ignited a demand for smart infrastructure—think flood barriers, AI-driven drainage systems, and climate-resilient building materials. This isn't greenwashing; it's survival. Here's the math:

- Insurance costs are soaring, pushing businesses and homeowners to invest in protection.

- Government funding is flowing: FEMA's Individual Assistance program and state disaster loans are fueling demand.

- Private-sector innovation is racing to meet this need—companies are developing everything from smart levees to real-time flood sensors.

The Perryman Group estimates Texas's recovery could take years, but the infrastructure play is a decade-long trend. This isn't a fad; it's a new economic era.

The Companies Leading the Charge

Jim Cramer's Action Alert: These are the names to watch as flood mitigation goes mainstream.

1. AECOM (MAC)

The infrastructure giant is already working on post-flood rebuilding in Texas. MAC's expertise in resilient design—think flood-proof bridges and drainage systems—is unmatched.

Why buy? It's a one-stop shop for governments and businesses looking to rebuild smarter.

2. Tetra Tech (TTEK)

TTEK's environmental engineering and disaster recovery services are front-and-center in Texas. They're deploying AI-driven flood modeling to help cities plan defenses.

Why buy? A $1.2 billion backlog of climate resilience projects.

3. Xylem (XYL)

This water tech leader makes smart pumps and flood sensors that prevent urban flooding. With cities like Houston desperate for solutions, XYL's products are must-haves.

Why buy? A 20% revenue boost expected from climate resilience projects by 2026.

The Broader Play: ETFs and Smart Infrastructure Funds

Not ready to pick individual stocks? Go broad and bold with ETFs that bundle the climate resilience boom:

- iShares U.S. Infrastructure ETF (IFRA): Tracks companies like MAC, TTEK, and construction firms.

- Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Materials ETF (RWL): For materials firms making flood-resistant concrete and steel.

Risks? Sure—but the Upside is a Tsunami

Critics will cite government delays or overbuilding. But here's the truth: Texas won't rebuild the same way again. Flood insurance mandates, stricter zoning laws, and federal grants mean this isn't a one-off spend—it's a new normal.

Final Takeaway: Ride the Wave

The June floods were a disaster. But for investors, they're a golden opportunity. Whether you're buying MAC, TTEK, or a slice of IFRA, this is your chance to bet on a world where climate resilience isn't optional—it's essential.

Action Alert: Buy these names now—before the next storm hits.

The company delivered 384,112 vehicles, missing projections by nearly 3,000 units.

This occurs against a backdrop of various pressures, including an ongoing public dispute between CEO Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump.

Despite this, Tesla's stock showed resilience with an increase in its value.

Tesla is heavily reliant on EV sales for its revenue, yet its strategic vision extends to a diverse product range covering robotaxis, humanoid robots, solar panels and battery storage systems.

These emerging technologies, particularly relevant to the manufacturing and industrial sectors, highlight Tesla's ambition to integrate clean energy solutions into manufacturing processes.

EV market influence

Tesla's grip on the US EV market has witnessed a reduction from an earlier dominance of about 75% in Q1 2022 to 43.5% in Q1 2025.

Competitors like General Motors are rapidly gaining ground in the sector, with multiple offerings across brands such as Cadillac and Chevy.

Cassandra Garber, Chief Sustainability Officer at General Motors, said: “We’re now the #2 EV company in the US, thanks to the dozen EV models we offer across the Chevrolet, Cadillac, GMC Hummer, and Buick brands. I love our vehicles! You need to experience GM’s incredible advancements in design and technology.”

Moreover, on a global scale, BYD, a Chinese manufacturer, captured 22.2% of the EV market in 2024, surpassing Tesla, which held 10.3%. Emerging brands like Wuling, BMW, and Li Auto are also challenging Tesla's market share, a trend that reflects a dynamic shift within the EV sector and which could potentially impact manufacturing operations.

Expansion into solar and energy storage

Beyond automobiles, Tesla is also making moves into the solar energy and battery storage domains.

Since acquiring SolarCity in 2016 for $2.6bn, Tesla has developed, manufactured and installed photovoltaic solar systems alongside its EV production.

The company's objective has been to foster a sustainable energy ecosystem, directly influencing innovations in manufacturing energy solutions.

A notable contract in 2024 saw Intersect Power securing a 15.3 GWh storage agreement with Tesla.

Mike Snyder, VP, Energy and Charging at Tesla, said: ""Intersect continues to be an exceptional partner and their development expertise combined with the plug-and-play nature of Tesla’s vertically integrated technology enables the speed and scale needed to enhance grid resilience and support greater renewables integration.""

Tesla's autonomous vehicles

Tesla's approach to autonomous vehicle technology, in the form of robotaxis, distinguishes itself in the market by its reliance on cameras over technologies like radar and LiDAR, which are used by competitors such as Waymo and Zoox.

While this could bring cost advantages, it has also invited regulatory and consumer scrutiny.

The NHTSA pointed out recently that it 'does not pre-approve new technologies or vehicle systems' but mandates manufacturers to ensure compliance with safety standards pending investigations into potential safety flaws.

The launch of Tesla's autonomous fleet in Austin, Texas, in June 2025, drew attention due to claims of traffic violations seen in social media footage.

The NHTSA confirmed ongoing communications with Tesla about these concerns, underscoring the need for compliance amid technological advances in manufacturing and transport systems.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/3777ee9e3edf5cfebed9168709a6fcc9:97dee7d66a397a5f68a77a071a8ac516/charlie-deets-d1w5qenbzlu-unsplash.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-07-05 00:03:20.912648

July 3 (Reuters) – It is the end of the line for U.S. electric vehicle tax credits.

Sweeping tax and budget legislation approved by Congress on Thursday means $7,500 tax credits for buying or leasing new electric vehicles will end on September 30, as well as a $4,000 used EV credit, that have helped juice green vehicle sales in recent years.

The Electrification Coalition, an EV advocacy group, said on Thursday “as EVs secure a growing share of the global automotive market, it is obvious that the future of transportation is electric; this bill forfeits America’s role in that future to China.”

Congress first approved a $7,500 EV tax credit in 2008 that it phased out after manufacturers hit 200,000 vehicles. The credit was expanded in 2022 to cover leased vehicles and the per manufacturer cap was lifted.

Separately, U.S. automakers stand to receive significant benefits from the final bill that eliminates penalties for failing to meet Corporate Average Fuel Economy shortfalls. The measure makes it easier for automakers to build gas-powered vehicles.

Barclays auto analyst Dan Levy said the tax credit phase-out in less than three months means EV sales will significantly jump via a “pre-buy” since some consumers will move up purchases planned for later with sharp declines in the months to follow.

“We believe the bill reiterates the slowdown ahead for EV penetration in the U.S., with both the ‘carrot’ (i.e. tax credits/incentives) and the ‘stick’ (i.e. emissions regulations) softened,” Levy wrote in a research note.

A Harvard University study released in March forecast that ending the EV tax credits would reduce EV penetration by 6% by 2030 and would save the government $169 billion in EV tax credits over a decade.

Last year, Chrysler parent Stellantis (STLAM.MI) paid $190.7 million in civil penalties for failing to meet U.S. fuel economy requirements for 2019 and 2020 after paying nearly $400 million for penalties from 2016 through 2019. GM previously paid $128.2 million in penalties for 2016 and 2017.

In the final bill, Congress dropped a planned $250 annual fee for EVs to pay for road repairs, as well as a requirement that the U.S. Postal Service sell off its EV delivery vehicles.

Ben Parker

BBC political reporter, Suffolk

""Build baby build"", said Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer in February while talking about energy infrastructure.

A year on from Labour winning the general election on 4 July 2024, what decisions have ministers made on energy projects planned for Suffolk?

Billions for Sizewell C

New nuclear power has been a big part of Labour's plans for energy generation, the government has backed small nuclear reactors and pledged huge amounts of money towards a major nuclear power station on the Suffolk coast.

Sizewell C nuclear plant gets £14bn go-ahead from government

Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the ""landmark decision"" would ""kickstart"" economic growth, while Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said the investment was necessary to usher in a ""golden age of clean energy"".

It is still not enough to actually build Sizewell C. Private investment is being sought, with a final decision expected this year.

Opposition campaigners have condemned the government's use of public money to fund the project.

Alison Downes from Stop Sizewell C said: ""There still appears to be no final investment decision for Sizewell C but £14.2bn in taxpayers' funding, a decision we condemn and firmly believe the government will come to regret.""

Early solar decision

One of the first major decisions taken by Labour was giving the green light to the Sunnica solar farm.

The £600m energy farm is set to be 2,500 acres (1,012 hectares) and spread across three separate sites on the Cambridgeshire-Suffolk border.

The Conservative government had delayed making a planning decision on the project numerous times.

Secretary of State for Energy Security Ed Miliband approved the plans just over a week after the election.

He said: ""Some of these cases had been held up for months before I arrived in the department.

""They were put on my desk on Monday and I've made a decision in three days.""

It was controversial. Some locals said they were ""shell-shocked"".

Conservative Richard Rout, who is in charge of nationally significant infrastructure projects at Suffolk County Council, said the government was ""going for pace over everything else"".

He said there had been a ""rush"" of solar projects pitched for Suffolk.

On government plans for planning reform, Rout said: ""I'm afraid the Suffolk countryside will see more pylons and more solar farms as a result.""

The government's solar roadmap sets out plans to increase how large solar farms can be before they have to be considered nationally significant infrastructure projects, which the government said could end up ""potentially, resulting in faster and cheaper consenting"".

Offshore power, onshore problems

More than a hundred wind turbines are already operating off Suffolk's coast, with approval granted to build more.

There are not many objections to offshore wind, but the way the energy is brought onshore upsets some.

Cables land on beaches and stretch to converter and substations, which are large industrial sites.

One substation, planned for the village of Friston, has seen considerable opposition.

There have been calls for an offshore power network to be built at sea, which would save the need for onshore infrastructure, however the government has so far not shown any interest.

Meanwhile plans for undersea cables connecting the Suffolk coast to the Netherlands and Kent are progressing.

Lionlink and Sea Link have local opposition as it would see onshore infrastructure built to connect to the power grid.

112 miles of pylons

Another controversial energy project is the Norwich to Tilbury pylon plan.

It would see energy pylons and underground cables running from Norfolk, through Suffolk to Essex.

Jerome Mayhew, the Conservative MP for Broadland and Fakenham, said plans to build more than 100 miles (161km) of pylons was ""ideological madness"".

There has been support from senior Labour figures, with the chancellor previously saying it was ""time to get on with it"".

There have been calls to move the infrastructure out to sea or bury more underground.

The Labour MP for Lowestoft Jess Asato said she believed pylons were the best idea.

She said of calls for more underground cables: ""We are talking about huge tunnels bored into the ground and a lot of loss of biodiversity.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6d20/live/07b1fd40-566b-11f0-9fc1-5b48baa78cfc.jpg,N,,2025-07-04 19:09:13.647601

In so doing, it has spawned far more makers than can possibly survive. Now, long-simmering concerns about oversupply and debilitating price wars are coming to the fore, even as the headline sales numbers soar to new heights.

Market-leader BYD announced this week that its sales grew 31% in the first six months of the year to 2.1 million cars. Nearly half of those were pure electric vehicles and the rest were plug-in hybrids, it said in a Hong Kong Stock Exchange filing. The company phased out internal combustion engine cars in 2022.

BYD came under thinly veiled criticism in late May when it launched a new round of price cuts, and several competitors followed suit. The chairman of Great Wall Motors warned the industry could come under threat if it continues on the same trajectory.

“When volumes get bigger, it’s just much harder to manage and you become the bullseye,” said Lei Xing, an independent analyst who follows the industry.

The government is trying to rein in what is called “involution” — a term initially applied to the rat race for young people in China and now to companies and industries engaged in meaningless competition that leads nowhere.

BYD has come under criticism for using its dominant position in ways that some consider unfair, sparking price wars that have caused losses across the industry, said Murthy Grandhi, an India-based financial risk analyst at GlobalData.

With the price war in its fourth year, Chinese automakers are looking abroad for profits. BYD’s overseas sales more than doubled to 464,000 units in the first half of this year. Worried governments in the U.S. and EU have imposed tariffs on made-in-China electric vehicles, saying that subsidies have given them an unfair advantage.

Market leader BYD comes under attack

The latest bout of handwringing started when BYD cut the price of more than 20 models on May 23.

The same day, the chairman of Great Wall Motors, Wei Jianjun, said he was pessimistic about what he called the “healthy development” of the EV market. He drew a comparison to Evergrande, the Chinese real estate giant whose collapse sent the entire industry into a downturn from which it has yet to recover.

“The Evergrande in the automobile industry already exists, but it is just yet to explode,” he said in a video message posted on social media.

Two days later, a BYD executive rejected any comparison to Evergrande and posted data-filled charts to buttress his case.

“To be honest, I am confused and angry and it’s ridiculous!” Li Yunfei, BYD’s general manager of brand and public relations, wrote on social media. “All these come from the shocking remarks made by Chairman Wei of Great Wall Motors.”

Next, the government and an industry association weighed in. The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers called for fair competition and healthy development of the industry, noting that major price cuts by one automaker had triggered a new price war panic.

On the same day, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology vowed to tackle involution-style competition in the auto industry, saying that recent disorderly price wars posed a treat to the healthy and sustainable development of the sector.

“That price cut might have been the final straw that irked both competitors and regulators for the ruthlessness that BYD continues to show,” Lei said.

A promise to pay suppliers within 60 days signals possible shift

The following month, 17 automakers including BYD made a pledge: They would pay their suppliers within 60 days.

One way China’s automakers have been surviving the bruising price wars is by delaying the payments for months. The agreement, if adhered to, would reduce financial pressure on suppliers and could rein in some of the fierce competition.

“The introduction of the 60-day payment pledge is the call of the government to oppose involution-style competition,” said Cui Dongshu, the secretary-general of the China Passenger Car Association.

It also reduces the risk of an Evergrande-like scenario.

Many automakers had stretched out payments by paying suppliers with short-term debt — promises to repay them in a certain period of time — instead of cash. Real estate developers used the same system. It worked until it didn’t. When Evergrande defaulted on its debts, suppliers were left holding worthless promises to pay.

“This practice is seen as a potential cause of a larger crisis, similar to what happened with Evergrande,” Grandhi said.

The vows to speed up payments and the government calls to rein in the price wars, along with a rollback of some financing offers, point to an effort to reverse downward price expectations, said Jing Yang, a director at Fitch Ratings who focuses on the auto industry.

“We may watch how effectively these measures are in reversing the price trend and how would that affect EV demand in the coming quarters,” she said.

The White House said that by raising prices, national parks will become more affordable for American families. The order does not specify how much the prices would go up or when they would be implemented.

The administration argued additional revenue will “fuel investment in our national parks, reduce the maintenance backlog, construct critical infrastructure improvements and support conservation projects that improve our majestic national parks.”

The White House said increasing fees for foreigners visiting the parks will “ensure fairness.”

“American citizens fund national parks and public lands with their tax dollars, yet they are currently charged the same rate as foreign visitors who do not pay taxes, meaning that American citizens pay more to see their own national treasures than foreign visitors do,” the White House said in the fact sheet.

The 2017 tax bill placed a cap on SALT deductions at $10,000.
Those return payments technically count as public health care spending and help Connecticut qualify for federal Medicaid grants.","President Donald J. Trump’s sweeping bill that is set to become law on Friday will have wide-ranging implications in Connecticut and across the country on everything from taxes to health care to nutrition assistance.

Many of the tax breaks and provisions will go into effect pretty quickly or in the near future. But some of the cost-cutting measures to pay for the bill will take a couple of years before they kick in, like the most significant changes to Medicaid.

Parts of the bill will be permanent, including the 2017 tax cuts passed during the first Trump administration that were set to expire at the end of this year. That includes lower income tax rates as well as the lower corporate tax rate. But some relief will only last for a few years, like deductions on overtime pay and tips on federal income taxes.

Many of the provisions line up around upcoming elections. Some of more generous tax relief, which could give Republicans a boost in their reelection efforts, won’t expire until after the 2026 midterm elections when control of Congress is up for grabs.

And the reforms to Medicaid and nutrition assistance that could lead to cuts — that Democrats, who all voted against the bill, have warned about — won’t apply until late in Trump’s term and close to the 2028 presidential election.

What taxpayers will see in the near term and when provisions will expire

A number of new or modified tax deductions and credits will go into effect this year, though many are set to expire after a few years. That relief will go toward families, children, tipped workers and seniors, though lower earners will not benefit as much.

The bill modestly and permanently raises the maximum amount of the child tax credit from $2,000 to $2,200 per child under the age of 17 and requires at least one parent to have a Social Security number. Those with lower incomes will not benefit as much because they make too little and the tax credit is not fully refundable.

Changes to state and local tax deductions, known as SALT, will be especially beneficial for higher cost-of-living states like Connecticut. In 2022, state taxpayers had the highest average SALT deduction, around $9,100, just under the current $10,000 cap, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. That year, 11% of Connecticut’s returns claimed SALT, one of the highest rates in the U.S.

The 2017 tax bill placed a cap on SALT deductions at $10,000. The new legislation raises it to $40,000 and would get phased out for those who make over $500,000, starting in the 2025 calendar year. The cap would increase by 1% each year starting in 2025 through 2029. It would then go back down to the current threshold in 2030.

Workers will be able to deduct overtime pay or tips from their federal income tax, though there are limitations to the amount of the deductions and which workers qualify. The deductions related to tips are capped at $25,000 a year, while workers can deduct up to $12,500 on overtime pay. That relief phases out for those who earn over $150,000 a year or $300,000 if filing jointly.

And taxpayers can deduct up to $10,000 of interest on their auto loans if the car is new and assembled in the U.S. All three of those tax deductions would take effect in 2025 and last through 2028.

Seniors who are 65 and older with low to middle incomes will be able to make an additional $6,000 deduction that will start in the 2025 tax year and run through 2028. The full deduction will apply to those who individually earn under $75,000 a year or $150,000 for couples. It starts to phase out above those income thresholds and cuts off at $175,000 or $250,000 if filing jointly.

The bill will automatically create new savings accounts for newborns born between Jan. 1, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2028. The federal government will contribute a one-time infusion of $1,000 and then allow parents to contribute $5,000 a year up until age 18 that can be invested in the stock market. The secretary of the Treasury will automatically open an account if a parent doesn’t establish one.

On energy, the bill will wind down some of the clean energy tax incentives that were implemented during the Biden administration in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act soon, while others will take a few years.

Tax credits to make homes more energy efficient as well as electric vehicle rebates will go away by the end of the year.

While some of the Medicaid provisions will take a few years to set in, people will see more immediate effects related to the enrollment process for the Affordable Care Act and its subsidies. Starting next year, there will be requirements to verify an enrollee’s income and immigration status instead of automatic re-enrollment.

What will go into effect over the next few years

States like Connecticut will need to implement big changes to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps, in the coming years. Some states could be eligible for delays in implementation.

One of the biggest implications of the bill will be on states’ finances as they take on more of the costs associated with these safety net programs. That could have a domino effect on how states fund and structure the programs and lead to reductions in benefits or changes to eligibility standards.

Both programs will institute new work requirements for certain beneficiaries in order to be eligible, while states will take on new costs that were once covered by the federal government.

To qualify for Medicaid as an adult under 65, a recipient will need to work or participate in training, education or community service at least 80 hours a month. That criteria will also apply to parents or guardians who have children 14 and older.

Exemptions will apply to certain groups including parents, guardians or caretakers of children 13 and under or who are disabled, veterans with disabilities, those who are “medically frail” or have serious medical conditions and those who are pregnant. Recipients will now need to prove they are eligible twice a year, instead of once.

This would go into effect on Dec. 31, 2026 at the earliest, though states can apply for a waiver to give them until the end of 2028 to comply with the new requirements.

Almost 950,000 people are enrolled in Connecticut’s Medicaid program known as HUSKY, according to DSS. About 73% of Connecticut adults on Medicaid were working either part-time or full-time, according to a KFF analysis of the 2023 American Community Survey.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which analyzes and scores federal legislation, estimated that about 138,000 people could lose Medicaid coverage in Connecticut, with the higher end of enrollment loss up to 172,000.

From 2028 to 2032, it also lowers Medicaid provider taxes, which enables states to increase the amount of Medicaid funding they receive from the federal government. This change will apply to states that expanded Medicaid, which Connecticut did after the enactment of the Affordable Care Act.

Nearly all states use such taxes to increase what they get for Medicaid. Connecticut has levied a provider tax that collects hundreds of millions annually from hospitals then redistributes those funds, plus more, back to the industry. Those return payments technically count as public health care spending and help Connecticut qualify for federal Medicaid grants.

States depend heavily on the federal government to help pay for Medicaid. The state’s Office of Policy and Management projected Connecticut would spend a total of $11.6 billion on Medicaid in fiscal year 2025. The federal government contributed about 59% of that funding, which is about $6.9 billion.

Connecticut Department of Social Services Commissioner Andrea Barton Reeves said she fears people will decide it’s too cumbersome to comply with the requirements and be forced to find coverage that’s higher cost or lower quality. DSS oversees HUSKY and SNAP.

“We believe they’re just going to be so frustrated and so ground down by the process that’s already quite complicated in its current form,” Barton Reeves said in an interview with The Connecticut Mirror on Thursday. “Their health will suffer and we’ll see really bad effects as a result.”

Stricter work requirements will also apply to some SNAP recipients, with similar exemptions to the ones in the Medicaid provision. About 69% of Connecticut households on SNAP already have at least one 18- to 55-year-old member working, according to DSS.

Now, more older Americans will need to work or train at least 80 hours a month to receive SNAP. The bill raises the age limit for able-bodied adults without dependents from 54 to 64. And it also applies to able-bodied adults who have children 14 and older. The bill lowered the age of a dependent, which is currently under age 18.

States may also need to pick up some of the costs associated with SNAP benefits for the first time in the nutrition program’s history. The federal government has always paid 100% of the benefits and equally shared the administrative costs with states.

Starting in fiscal year 2028, states will need to keep their payment error rate below 6% in order for the feds to keep paying for all costs associated with SNAP benefits. Those error rates take into account overpayments and underpayments.

But if it’s higher, states will have to take on anywhere from 5% up to 15%. And they will also need to pay more of the administrative fees starting in fiscal year 2027.

Connecticut’s payment error rate was about 10% in 2024. Based off of that number, the state would hit the top of the threshold and pay 15% of SNAP benefits. But that number will change since Connecticut’s share will be determined by the payment error rate from either fiscal year 2025 or 2026 — and the state can choose between the two. States may be able to delay implementation for another year or two.

In Connecticut, more than 400,000 people got SNAP benefits in 2025, according to the DSS. More than half of the recipients in the state are in families with children. That same year, Connecticut received a total of $894 million in SNAP benefits. The average benefit for each household member per month was about $190.

The tight roll call, 218-214, came at a potentially high political cost, with two Republicans joining all Democrats opposed. GOP leaders worked overnight and the president himself leaned on a handful of skeptics to drop their opposition. Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York delayed voting for more than eight hours by seizing control of the floor with a record-breaking speech against the bill.

Trump celebrated his political victory in Iowa, where he attended the kickoff for a year of events marking the country’s upcoming 250th anniversary.

“I want to thank Republican congressmen and women, because what they did is incredible,” he said. The president complained that Democrats voted against the bill because “they hate Trump — but I hate them too.”

Trump said he plans to sign the legislation on Friday at the White House.

The outcome delivers a milestone for the president and for his party. It was a long-shot effort to compile a lengthy list of GOP priorities into what they called his “one big beautiful bill,” at nearly 900 pages. With Democrats unified in opposition, the bill will become a defining measure of Trump’s return to the White House, aided by Republican control of Congress.

“You get tired of winning yet?” said House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., invoking Trump as he called the vote.

“With one big beautiful bill we are going to make this country stronger, safer and more prosperous than ever before,” he said.

Republicans celebrated with a rendition of the Village People’s “Y.M.C.A.,” a song the president often plays at his rallies, during a ceremony afterward.

Tax breaks and safety net cuts

At its core, the package’s priority is $4.5 trillion in tax breaks enacted in 2017 during Trump’s first term that would expire if Congress failed to act, along with new ones. This includes allowing workers to deduct tips and overtime pay, and a $6,000 deduction for most older adults earning less than $75,000 a year.

There’s also a hefty investment, some $350 billion, in national security and Trump’s deportation agenda and to help develop the “Golden Dome” defensive system over the U.S.

To help offset the lost tax revenue, the package includes $1.2 trillion in cutbacks to the Medicaid health care and food stamps, largely by imposing new work requirements, including for some parents and older people, and a major rollback of green energy tax credits.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the package will add $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the decade and 11.8 million more people will go without health coverage.

“This was a generational opportunity to deliver the most comprehensive and consequential set of conservative reforms in modern history, and that’s exactly what we’re doing,” said Rep. Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, the House Budget Committee chairman.

Democrats united against the big ‘ugly bill’

Democrats unified against the bill as a tax giveaway to the rich paid for on the backs of the working class and most vulnerable in society, what they called “trickle down cruelty.”

Jeffries began the speech at 4:53 a.m. EDT and finished at 1:37 p.m. EDT, 8 hours, 44 minutes later, a record, as he argued against what he called Trump’s “big ugly bill.”

“We’re better than this,” said Jeffries, who used a leader’s prerogative for unlimited debate, and read letter after letter from Americans writing about their reliance of the health care programs.

“I never thought that I’d be on the House floor saying that this is a crime scene,” Jeffries said. “It’s a crime scene, going after the health, and the safety, and the well-being of the American people.”

And as Democrats, he said, “We want no part of it.”

Tensions ran high. As fellow Democrats chanted Jeffries’ name, a top Republican, Rep. Jason Smith of Missouri, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, called his speech “a bunch of hogwash.”

Hauling the package through the Congress has been difficult from the start. Republicans have struggled mightily with the bill nearly every step of the way, quarreling in the House and Senate, and often succeeding only by the narrowest of margins: just one vote.

The Senate passed the package days earlier with Vice President JD Vance breaking the tie vote. The slim majority in the House left Republicans little room for defections.

“It wasn’t beautiful enough for me to vote for it,” said Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky. Also voting no was Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, who said he was concerned about cuts to Medicaid.

Once Johnson gaveled the tally, Republicans cheered “USA!” and flashed Trump-style thumbs-up to the cameras.

Political costs of saying no

Despite their discomfort with various aspects of the sprawling package, in some ways it became too big to fail — in part because Republicans found it difficult to buck Trump.

As Wednesday’s stalled floor action dragged overnight, Trump railed against the delays.

“What are the Republicans waiting for???” the president said in a midnight-hour post.

Johnson relied heavily on White House Cabinet secretaries, lawyers and others to satisfy skeptical GOP holdouts. Moderate Republicans worried about the severity of cuts while conservatives pressed for steeper reductions. Lawmakers said they were being told the administration could provide executive actions, projects or other provisions in their districts back home.

The alternative was clear. Republicans who staked out opposition to the bill, including Massie of Kentucky and Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, were being warned by Trump’s well-funded political operation. Tillis soon after announced he would not seek reelection.

Rollback of past presidential agendas

In many ways, the package is a repudiation of the agendas of the last two Democratic presidents, a chiseling away at the Medicaid expansion from Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act, and a pullback of Joe Biden’s climate change strategies in the Inflation Reduction Act.

Democrats have described the bill in dire terms, warning that cuts to Medicaid, which some 80 million Americans rely on, would result in lives lost. Food stamps that help feed more than 40 million people would “rip food from the mouths of hungry children, hungry veterans and hungry seniors,” Jeffries said.

Republicans say the tax breaks will prevent a tax hike on households and grow the economy. They maintain they are trying to rightsize the safety net programs for the population they were initially designed to serve, mainly pregnant women, the disabled and children, and root out what they describe as waste, fraud and abuse.

The Tax Policy Center, which provides nonpartisan analysis of tax and budget policy, projected the bill would result next year in a $150 tax break for the lowest quintile of Americans, a $1,750 tax cut for the middle quintile and a $10,950 tax cut for the top quintile. That’s compared with what they would face if the 2017 tax cuts expired.

Conservatives have repeatedly refused to back major legislation because of its potential impact on federal deficits, only to back down under pressure from Mr. Trump.
Representative Andy Harris of Maryland, one such holdout, alluded to deals that he and others cut with Mr. Trump.","The House on Thursday narrowly passed a sweeping bill to extend tax cuts and slash social safety net programs, capping Republicans’ chaotic monthslong slog to overcome deep rifts within their party and deliver President Trump’s domestic agenda.

The final vote, 218 to 214, was mostly along party lines and came after Speaker Mike Johnson spent a frenzied day and night toiling to quell resistance in his ranks that threatened until the very end to derail the president’s marquee legislation. With all but two Republicans in favor and Democrats uniformly opposed, the action cleared the bill for Mr. Trump’s signature, meeting the July 4 deadline he had demanded.

The legislation extends tax cuts enacted in 2017 that had been scheduled to expire at the end of the year, while adding new ones Mr. Trump promised during this campaign, on some tips and overtime pay, at a total cost of $4.5 trillion. It also increases funding for defense and border security and cuts nearly $1 trillion from Medicaid, with more reductions to food assistance for the poor and other government aid. And it phases out clean-energy tax credits passed under former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. that Mr. Trump and conservative Republicans have long decried.

Also included is a $5 trillion increase in the debt limit, a measure that Republicans are typically unwilling to support but that was necessary to avert a federal default later this year.

The bill’s final passage was a major victory for congressional Republicans and for Mr. Trump, who celebrated in a Thursday night speech in Des Moines, Iowa, meant to kick off a yearlong celebration of the 250th anniversary of the country’s founding.

“With this bill,” Mr. Trump said, “every major promise I’ve made to the people of Iowa in 2024 became a promise kept.”

Mr. Trump plans to sign what he has frequently referred to as his “big, beautiful bill” on Friday. G.O.P. lawmakers who had feuded bitterly over the legislation ultimately united almost unanimously behind it, fearing the political consequences of allowing a tax increase and of crossing a president who demands unflagging loyalty and was pressuring them to fall into line.

“If you’re for a secure border, safer communities and a strong military, this bill is for you,” Mr. Johnson said, extolling the bill ahead of the final vote. “If you’re for common-sense fiscal responsibility and reducing the deficit, this bill is for you. If you’re for fairer and lower taxes, bigger paychecks, affordable gas and groceries and restoring dignity to hard work, this is the bill for you.”

But it also was a major political gamble for the party that will leave vulnerable lawmakers open to sharp attacks ahead of next year’s midterm elections.

Many economists have estimated that its greatest benefits would go to the wealthiest Americans, who would see the most generous tax cuts. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office recently predicted that cuts to Medicaid, including the imposition of a strict work requirement, could leave 11.8 million more people without health insurance by 2034.

The office, studying earlier versions of the bill, had also warned of large benefit losses in food stamps, which will also have new work requirements, threatening to leave millions without benefits. At the same time, contrary to Republican claims that it cut deficits, the budget office reported the measure would swell the already soaring national debt by at least $3.4 trillion over a decade.

Polls show that the bill is deeply unpopular, and Democrats have roundly denounced it as a move to slash critical government programs to fund tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans. They have repeatedly accused Republicans of being so much in Mr. Trump’s thrall that they embraced a bill that would harm their own constituents, with cuts to programs that the president had vowed to protect.

In an impassioned closing speech on the House floor that stretched for more than eight and a half hours, breaking the chamber’s record and delaying a final vote well into the afternoon, Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, assailed the measure as a “disgusting abomination” that would hurt Americans.

In what amounted to a last gasp of Democratic opposition to the bill, Mr. Jeffries spent much of his time reading testimonials from Americans who said they relied on Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and other government help and worried that cuts would upend their lives. He made a point of highlighting that several of the letters came from people who live in Republican congressional districts that are among the Democrats’ top targets for the midterm elections.

“This bill is an all-out assault on the health care of the people of the United States of America, hardworking American taxpayers,” Mr. Jeffries said. “These are the people we should be standing up, to work hard to lift up. But instead, they’re victims of this legislation.”

In the messy, monthslong process of pushing through a bill that divided their party, Republicans in both the House and Senate made it clear that they, too, were uncomfortable with parts of it, criticizing its flaws before most of them ultimately banded together to pass it.

Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, who cast the deciding vote for the bill in her chamber after cutting a series of deals to insulate her constituents from its harshest cuts, said just moments after she had backed the bill that she did not like it.

“This has been an awful process — a frantic rush to meet an artificial deadline that has tested every limit of this institution,” Ms. Murkowski said in a statement earlier this week, in which she urged the House to reopen and improve it.

As if to underscore the political risks of the bill — and the intense pressure Republicans faced from Mr. Trump to embrace it — Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina announced during Senate debate on it that he would not seek re-election next year. He went on to savage the bill as a disaster for Medicaid that would betray the president’s promises to protect the program. The announcement from Mr. Tillis, whom Mr. Trump had threatened with a primary challenge after he expressed opposition to the bill, was a harsh reminder for Republicans of the consequences of crossing the president on the measure.

Because of the slim Republican majorities in both chambers, ideological rifts within the party were frequently magnified as Mr. Johnson and Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the majority leader, tried to muscle the legislation through the House and Senate. They succeeded only after protracted negotiations, several seemingly insurmountable setbacks and parliamentary gymnastics.

The House devolved into paralysis on Wednesday and into Thursday morning in the hours before the final action, as a handful of Republicans withheld their votes to bring up the measure.

Mr. Trump, who had met with recalcitrant Republicans throughout the day Wednesday to pressure them to support the measure, weighed in with angry posts on social media, threatening any defectors.

“MAGA IS NOT HAPPY, AND IT’S COSTING YOU VOTES!!!” he wrote.

In the end, Mr. Johnson pulled off a victory, the latest in a series of instances in which he has faced resistance in his own party to a major legislative priority — only to pull out a narrow win with the help of considerable pressure from Mr. Trump.

The bill squeaked through the Senate by the narrowest of margins on Tuesday. But the changes that senators made to cobble together support for it exacerbated party divides that have plagued G.O.P. efforts to advance Mr. Trump’s agenda since the beginning. Fiscal conservatives demanded even deeper cuts to rein in the deficit, while more mainstream lawmakers whose seats are at risk were wary of the biggest cuts to popular government programs.

One member of each faction voted against the bill on Thursday: Representative Thomas Massie, a fiscal hawk from a deep-red district in Kentucky who had railed against the high cost of the bill, and Representative Brian Fitzpatrick, a moderate from a battleground district in suburban Pennsylvania that Democrats won in the 2024 presidential election, who had expressed concern about the Medicaid, SNAP and other safety net cuts.

Mr. Trump and party leaders refused to reopen the bill for changes, a time-consuming process that would have blown through the president’s chosen timetable and prolonged negotiations on the package for weeks or months, potentially killing the entire enterprise.

Ultimately, the fiscal conservatives who had railed the most strongly against the bill followed a familiar pattern of caving and supporting it. Conservatives have repeatedly refused to back major legislation because of its potential impact on federal deficits, only to back down under pressure from Mr. Trump.

After the House gave final approval on Thursday, the president waved off questions about the fractious process, telling reporters on his way to Iowa that it was “very easy” to sway Republican holdouts. He equivocated on whether conservatives won any concessions outside the bill in last-minute talks.

Representative Andy Harris of Maryland, one such holdout, alluded to deals that he and others cut with Mr. Trump. Mr. Harris, the chairman of the ultraconservative Freedom Caucus, said that lawmakers were swayed by talk of “executive actions” and other steps he and his administration could take to change the way the law would be carried out.

“We came to significant agreements with the administration that changed the entire package, both inside and outside the bill, significantly.” Mr. Harris said after the final vote. (Once enacted, the legislation itself cannot be changed except by an act of Congress.)

Moments after the bill passed, some Freedom Caucus members were already raising the possibility of trying to push through another big policy bill later in the year under special rules that shield fiscal measures from a filibuster, allowing them to pass by a simple majority vote.

Representative Chip Roy of Texas, a Freedom Caucus member and one of the Republican holdouts who ultimately voted to pass the bill, said Mr. Trump and White House officials assured him on Wednesday they could use “another reconciliation package or two,” and executive orders, “to fix some of the broken appropriations process,” including additional changes to Medicaid, as well as to Medicare.

“I got comfortable with what the administration can do to ameliorate those areas where it got worse,” after the bill was passed by the Senate, Mr. Roy added.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/02/multimedia/02trump-news-cong-topart-gvkp/02trump-news-cong-topart-gvkp-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-07-04 18:10:55.345824

Climate United Fund and other nonprofits in March sued the Environmental Protection Agency, its administrator Lee Zeldin and Citibank, which held the program’s money. The lawsuit argued the defendants had illegally denied the groups access to billions awarded last year through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, commonly referred to as a “green bank.” The program was created by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

But the bill that passed Congress on Thursday would repeal the part of the 2022 law that established the green bank and rescind money that hadn’t already been obligated to its recipients.

The EPA said the bill should hand them a victory in their court fight that is being heard by a federal appeals court in Washington. Now that Congress has rescinded funding, an earlier federal judge’s decision forcing the EPA to release money to the groups should be reversed, the agency said in its Thursday court filing.

Climate United Fund disagrees. It acknowledges that the bill in Congress is a “significant policy setback” but argues that most of the money had been disbursed and is unaffected by the bill. And if the EPA wanted to take the money back, there’s a different process the agency would need to follow.

“Our funds have already been obligated and disbursed. Any effort to claim otherwise is simply a lie to justify illegal attempts to claw back funds intended to benefit communities across the country,” CEO Beth Bafford said in a statement.

The Congressional Budget Office estimated repealing the program would save just $19 million, which is in line with its administrative expenses only, indicating the bill doesn’t touch the multibillion-dollar grant awards, according to Lauren Tsuboyama, spokesperson for the Power Forward Communities coalition, which received a green bank award.

According to the EPA, when the agency terminated the grants the funds “became unobligated.”

“Grantees have desperately performed legal gymnastics to hold tens of billions of taxpayer dollars hostage. In the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill, Congress made their intent crystal clear in repealing the program entirely and returning those billions in unobligated funds to the U.S. Treasury,” EPA spokesperson Brigit Hirsch said in a statement.

The green bank’s goals run counter to the Trump administration’s opposition to policies that address climate change and its embrace of fossil fuels. Zeldin quickly made the bank a target, characterizing the $20 billion in grants as a scheme marred by conflicts of interest and potential fraud.

In February, Zeldin told Fox News that he suspected the green bank “was a clear cut case of waste and abuse” that “in my opinion, is criminal.” The following month, Zeldin terminated the grants.

U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan has previously said that when the federal government was asked for evidence of fraud, the agency didn’t provide it and shifted its position. Chutkan decided the government can’t terminate the contracts and that the groups should have access to some of their frozen money.

That order was put on hold during the EPA’s appeal.

The agency argues the nonprofits are making constitutional and statutory arguments that don’t apply in what it sees as a simple contract fight.

If the government successfully argues the case is a contract dispute, then the EPA says it should be heard by a different court that can only award a lump sum – not force the government to keep the grants in place. Federal officials argue there is no law or provision in the Constitution that compels the EPA to make these grants to these groups.

In its court filing, the EPA also pointed to comments by Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, chair of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, as supportive of the agency’s position. Capito said previously the bill intended to rescind billions in funding that had been frozen.

“This action reflects not only Congress’s deep concern with reducing the deficit, but EPA’s administration of the (green bank) under the Biden administration, the agency’s selection of grant recipients, and the absence of meaningful program oversight,” the agency quotes the senator as saying.

“Interest in the cars, demand for the cars,” Riggin said.
“It actually forced the price of the lower EVs—lower-priced EVs—back up into the mid-$20,000s sometimes,” Riggin said.","EV sales are slowing nationwide, but that doesn’t seem to be the case in Arkansas. EV registrations this year are far outpacing previous years.

“By far this is going to be the biggest year we’ve ever had for EVs, because we’ve already surpassed the average for the past few years just in the last five months,” said Scott Hardin, spokesperson for the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration.

DFA says that since January 1, over 2,000 EVs have been registered—already approaching last year’s totals. Hybrids are also outpacing last year’s growth. There are now over 8,800 EVs and nearly 49,000 hybrids in the state.

Here's a breakdown of the last several years, showing the accumulating number of EVs and hybrids registered in the state.

2019

Fully Electric = 781

Hybrid = 13,861

2020

Fully Electric = 1,303

Hybrid = 18,242

2021

Fully Electric =2,094

Hybrid =22,818

2022

Fully Electric =2,997

Hybrid =27,441

2023

Fully Electric = 4069

Hybrid = 32,068

2024

Fully Electric = 6,895

Hybrid = 41,652 hybrids

2025 (April 2025)

Fully Electric = 8,807

Hybrid = 48,797

“We hear all these stories nationwide of EV sales being down—not only down, but down significantly... and that’s just not the case here,” Hardin said. “We’ve collected $4 million in EV registration so far this year, whereas in the past five years combined, we collected about 12. So that just shows you how strong a year it’s been so far.”

Evolve Auto, Arkansas’ only all-EV dealership, says its sales have skyrocketed this year. Their most popular EV? No surprise—the Tesla Model 3.

“Year over year from 2014 to 2025, we’re currently at 181 percent of last year for the first six months,” said Collin Riggin, general manager at Evolve Auto.

So, what’s behind the success of EVs in Arkansas this year?

“Interest in the cars, demand for the cars,” Riggin said. “Pricing hasn’t affected it a whole lot. I mean, some of the higher-end EVs have come down some.”

Current federal tax credits may make buying an EV more attractive—but they haven’t necessarily had the effect of making them cheaper.

“It actually forced the price of the lower EVs—lower-priced EVs—back up into the mid-$20,000s sometimes,” Riggin said. “So some cars that did qualify a year ago would actually not qualify now.”

But the passage of President Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” today may change that.

“With them voting to end the tax credits today, it looks like those will—hopefully—actually allow the pricing of some of these lower-end cars to come back down to make them more affordable for everyday people,” Riggin said.

In the meantime, Tesla Cybertrucks appear to be multiplying in Arkansas. Hardin believes the demand for the highly anticipated truck has played a big part in the EV boom.

“I think you can attribute a lot of that to the truck,” Hardin said. “Because, I mean, just personally, I know people that were on that list for years waiting excitedly to get their hands on one.”",https://katv.com/resources/media2/16x9/1704/986/7x0/90/f3396626-0dcc-4109-add0-cc2217c7c4f0-EVMOBLEYBAM.JPG,N,,2025-07-04 17:10:33.361139

© Energiequelle GmbH- Energiequelle GmbH is building nine V162 turbines with a total capacity of 54 MW in Lower Saxony and is selling to Encavis

Kallinchen (renewablepress) - Energiequelle GmbH has erected and successfully commissioned nine Vestas V162 turbines in Zeven, Lower Saxony (Germany). With a hub height of 169 meters and a rotor diameter of 162 meters, the turbines are among the most modern of their kind. In future, they will supply around 40,000 households with electricity generated from renewable sources.

The entire construction of the wind farm was completed in a record time of just 14 months - and under challenging conditions: “We had over 600 hours of crane downtime, which equates to around 60 full working days,” explains project manager Robert Koddebusch. ""The persistent wind and extreme wetness really demanded everything from us in the boggy landscape. It was an enormous logistical and technical challenge. The fact that the project still remained on schedule is impressive proof of the high level of professionalism of everyone involved and the commitment of the entire project team.""

The project had to overcome a number of hurdles before construction could begin. For example, after approval was granted in February 2023, an objection was lodged by a third party, which led to a change in planning with regard to the type of plant and the application of the new Federal Nature Conservation Act. The subsequent approval for the project was finally granted in January 2024. This delayed the start of construction by more than six months. Construction of the wind farm then began in April 2024 and the first turbine went into operation on schedule at the beginning of May. All nine turbines have now been feeding the first kilowatt hours (kWh) into the grid for a few days. The wind farm is expected to generate around 133 million kWh of electricity per year.

Eight of the nine wind turbines were already sold to Encavis AG, a leading electricity producer from renewable energies in Europe, at the end of May. The ninth wind turbine will be operated by Bürgerwindpark Wistedt GmbH & Co. KG.

In addition to the ecological impact, the wind farm brings many economic benefits for the region. Lease payments and municipal participation create sustainable added value locally. Energiequelle focused on long-term partnerships, transparent communication and early involvement of the local population.

Energiequelle is planning further wind farms in the region and in Lower Saxony. Numerous additional wind turbines are also to be erected in the district of Rotenburg.

“We came to significant agreements with the administration that changed the entire package, both inside and outside the bill, significantly.” Mr. Harris said after the final vote.
In the case of the final holdouts in the House, their opposition ran headfirst into a bill that ultimately became too big to fail.
That would have risked alienating Senate Republicans, many of whom already had their own deep reservations with the legislation and passed it by only the narrowest of margins.
When it came to the final vote on Thursday, they again voted yes, just before Republicans celebrated the bill’s passage with chants of “USA!” Megan Mineiro and Michael Gold contributed reporting.","In the days leading up to House passage of Republicans’ sweeping policy bill carrying President Trump’s agenda, members of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus were unsparing in their criticism of the measure.

“That’s not fiscal responsibility. It’s not what we agreed to,” lawmakers in the caucus said in a statement after the Senate passed its version earlier this week with several major changes. “Republicans,” they added, “must do better.”

Representative Chip Roy, Republican of Texas and one of the most vocal fiscal hawks in Congress, fired off a series of posts outlining what he said were the seemingly endless list of problems with the bill.

“Increases deficits and violates the terms of the budget deal,” he wrote.

Representative Keith Self of Texas called it “morally and fiscally bankrupt.”

In the end, all of them voted for the bill, after an hourslong revolt that stretched from Wednesday night into early Thursday morning and ground the House floor to a halt. The legislation was unchanged, and while those who switched their positions to embrace it alluded to deals they had cut with Mr. Trump to address their concerns, it was not clear what, if any, commitments had been made or whether any would be fulfilled.

Representative Andy Harris of Maryland, the chairman of the Freedom Caucus, said that he and other conservative holdouts were swayed after discussions with Mr. Trump about “executive actions” and other steps he and his administration could take to change the way the law would be implemented.

“We came to significant agreements with the administration that changed the entire package, both inside and outside the bill, significantly.” Mr. Harris said after the final vote.

(Once enacted, the legislation itself cannot be changed except by an act of Congress.)

Mr. Roy wrote on social media that the Freedom Caucus had “successfully delivered substantive wins,” hinting that more would be revealed. Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters at the Capitol that the holdouts had not “caved,” but instead had made a “thoughtful and informed decision.”

They weren’t the only ones. A bloc of more moderate House Republicans from politically competitive districts, many of whom had warned that the bill’s Medicaid cuts could hurt their constituents and suggested they could not stomach the legislation, ultimately voted “yes.” They included Representative David Valadao of California, who just last weekend warned that he could not embrace the “harmful cuts to Medicaid” the Senate had included in its version of the bill.

Nor were members of the House alone in their abrupt turnabouts on the bill. Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, who cast the decisive vote for the bill in the Senate after holding out for special exemptions for her state from its harshest cuts, continued to criticize it even after it had passed.

“Do I like this bill? No,” she said.

Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, had been blunt about his concerns about the Medicaid cuts, warning his colleagues: “We cannot be a working-class party if you are taking away health care for working-class people.” Still, he voted yes.

In the case of the final holdouts in the House, their opposition ran headfirst into a bill that ultimately became too big to fail. If their leaders had opened the legislation to changes, a torrent of other lawmakers would have demanded the inclusion of their pet issues, too. That would have risked alienating Senate Republicans, many of whom already had their own deep reservations with the legislation and passed it by only the narrowest of margins. And it would have prompted a back and forth to work out differences between the two chambers that could have dragged on for weeks or months, potentially killing the enterprise altogether.

Several House Republicans who tried to win the support of the right-wing holdouts had argued behind closed doors that any compromise they tried to strike with the Senate risked making the bill less conservative, not more. They pointed to the extreme lengths to which Senate G.O.P. leaders had gone to win the vote of Ms. Murkowski, which involved lavishing costly benefits on her state and others.

Mr. Trump himself helped to make the case, privately speaking to the holdouts on the phone as they blocked the bill from coming to the floor overnight on Wednesday and publicly urging them to relent.

“What are the Republicans waiting for???” he wrote on social media. “What are you trying to prove???”

In the end, the holdouts withdrew their opposition and allowed the bill to move, returning to the House floor to cast their “aye’s.” As the procedural vote closed, many of them gathered around Mr. Johnson and smiled for a picture.

When it came to the final vote on Thursday, they again voted yes, just before Republicans celebrated the bill’s passage with chants of “USA!”

This financial boost, announced on July 4, 2025, supports VinFast’s mission to compete in the fiercely competitive EV market, where price wars are challenging profitability.

Funding Fuels Global Ambitions

The $510 million loan, facilitated by Jefferies Financial Group Inc. as the sole financial adviser, offers high-single-digit returns to lenders. A Vingroup representative, speaking for VinFast’s parent company, confirmed the fundraising supports ongoing business operations.

“The loan has been secured on favorable commercial terms, given the current market conditions,” the representative stated, highlighting the deal’s strategic timing amid tight market dynamics.

This infusion adds to VinFast’s recent financial maneuvers, including a $114 million syndicated loan from Bank Negara Indonesia and Maybank Indonesia in April 2025 for a factory in West Java, and ongoing talks for a $200 million loan from Indian lenders to tap into India’s massive car market.

Navigating a Competitive EV Landscape

VinFast, a subsidiary of Vingroup JSC, is aggressively expanding to challenge global EV giants like Tesla and Hyundai. The company’s strategy includes building manufacturing facilities in key markets, such as a planned plant in Subang, Indonesia, set to begin operations in late 2025.

This 300,000-vehicle-per-year facility in Hai Phong, Vietnam, already anchors its production. The EV sector, however, faces intense pressure from price cuts, squeezing margins. VinFast’s ability to secure substantial loans reflects confidence in its growth potential, backed by Vingroup founder Pham Nhat Vuong, who vowed last year to support the company “until I run out of money.”

Technical and Economic Implications

The loan enables VinFast to scale its production of electric SUVs, e-scooters, e-bikes, and e-buses, which are designed for both domestic and international markets. By investing in factories and charging infrastructure, VinFast aims to reduce range anxiety for EV owners, a critical barrier to adoption.

For example, its Indonesian plant will serve local and export markets, strengthening regional supply chains. Economically, these investments promise job creation—potentially thousands of jobs in Indonesia alone—and bolster local automotive industries. However, the high-single-digit interest rates on the loan signal the financial risks of rapid expansion in a volatile market. VinFast must balance growth with cost optimization to achieve its 2026 break-even target.

Regulatory and Industry Context

VinFast’s expansion aligns with global pushes for sustainable transportation, supported by incentives in markets like India and Indonesia. However, regulatory hurdles, such as compliance with local emissions standards and labor laws, could complicate operations. The company’s ability to navigate these, alongside securing financing, will determine its success against established competitors. For EV enthusiasts, VinFast’s growth means more affordable, premium EVs, potentially driving down costs through economies of scale.

Looking Ahead for EV Owners

For EV owners and enthusiasts, VinFast’s loan signals a broader trend: new players are intensifying competition, which could lead to better pricing and innovation. With plans to deliver over 51,000 EVs in Vietnam in 2024 and expand into the U.S., Europe, and Asia, VinFast is poised to make EVs more accessible. Its focus on charging networks and diverse vehicle lineups addresses practical needs, offering EV drivers more options for sustainable mobility.

This July 4, House Republicans celebrate more than our history.","This July 4, as Americans gather with friends and family to celebrate our independence, House Republicans are celebrating something in addition: progress. Real, tangible, patriotic progress.

The passage of President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act is a return to American values, and it couldn’t come at a better time.

This legislation is about putting the American people and freedom first — freedom from high taxes, from bloated bureaucracy, and from a government that has stopped working for the people. It’s about restoring the American Dream and giving every family the chance to build a better future.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act is a declaration that we still believe in the values that founded this country: self-reliance, personal responsibility, and limited government. We’re putting the American worker first. We’re saying loud and clear that the dignity of work still matters.

It expands the Child Tax Credit, giving parents more flexibility and freedom to provide for their children. It extends the 2017 tax cuts, preventing what would be the largest tax hike in a generation. No American should be saddled with higher taxes, and the “one big beautiful bill” gets it done.

As families light fireworks and honor our independence, they will know that their government is finally on their side. Republicans are not just standing on the sidelines; we’re leading with purpose. While Democrats focus on fringe agendas, Republicans are focused on kitchen table issues: taxes, work, and affordable living.

Every provision in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is built to help families thrive. That’s not just good policy, it’s the right thing to do. It’s a celebration of American resilience, entrepreneurship, and the spirit of self-determination.

Every House Democrat voted against this bill. They rejected relief for working families. They rejected work requirements. They voted to allow illegal immigrants to receive taxpayer funded healthcare. They rejected common sense. And we will make sure each one of them has to answer for it.

This bill is a reflection of our highest ideals. This is patriotism in action: standing up for families, fighting for opportunity, and refusing to let the American Dream die. We are proud of what we’ve accomplished, and we’re not done yet.

This July 4, House Republicans celebrate more than our history. We celebrate our future — a future built on freedom, responsibility, and prosperity for all.

According to the report emissions from agriculture fell by 1.7% last year.
In the transport sector, the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions was 1.2% last year.
Passenger cars are responsible for 49% of road transport emissions.
The remaining 20% of road transport emissions come from Ireland’s light goods vehicles and vans.","Ireland emitted 54 million tonnes of climate polluting greenhouse gases last year, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. This was 2% lower than in 2023.

It was the third consecutive year of reductions and the 16th occasion in the past 23 years that greenhouse gas emission went down.

EPA Director General Laura Burke said, however, that the fall was not enough and the reduction would need to be five times greater this year for Ireland to stay within the carbon budget required to achieve its EU and national climate targets.

The EPA report says 10 tonnes of greenhouse gases are emitted into the atmosphere every year, for every person in the country.

38% comes from farms, almost 22% from transport, just over 13% from producing energy, and a little over 10% from heating buildings.

Aggregate emissions from all sectors fell by 2% last year.

Although this represents a move in the right direction it is unimpressive compared to the reduction in 2023, when emissions went down by 6.8%.

Emissions went down in nearly all key sectors last year

There was an 8.9% reduction in emissions from generating electricity, a 1.2% reduction in emission from transport, and a 4.6% reduction in emissions from industry.

The winter months of 2024 were significantly colder than 2023. As a result there were 6.8% more days when heating was required. Emissions from the residential sector went up by 5.6% because of this.

The EPA says that while these findings are tangible and underscore the effectiveness of climate action and decarbonisation strategies, they are not good enough.

Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions at the end of 2024 were 11% below 2005 levels. This is well short of its binding EU commitment of a 42% reduction by 2030.

The report says a further 10% cut in overall emissions is needed in 2025 to stay on target.

EPA Senior Manager Dr Tomás Murray described how some sectors face greater challenges to decarbonise than others.

Agriculture and transport each require significant emissions cuts of 5.6% and 15.5%, respectively, in 2025 to meet their indicative percentage reduction targets.

According to the report emissions from agriculture fell by 1.7% last year.

The most significant driver of this reduction was a decrease in the total number of cattle, which was down by 2.9%.

Read the report in full here

Dairy cow numbers fell by 1.7%

This is the first annual reduction, after 13 consecutive years of increases, in dairy cow numbers - although average milk output for each dairy cow increased last year by 1.3%.

In addition, there was a reduction of 3.2% in the number of non-dairy cattle in the country, as well as a 7.9% reduction in the number of sheep.

The benefit in terms of lower emissions from these trends in agriculture was partly offset however, by extra emissions associated with a greater use of nitrogen fertiliser, which went up by 10.6%.

Electricity consumption for transport increased by 35.6% as the number of electric cars continued to rise.

Meanwhile, in the energy sector, emissions went down by 8.9% last year.

This was the third consecutive annual reduction in greenhouse gases from energy industries.

The reduction was partly due to an increase in the amount of electricity imported from the UK. The total amount imported was 5,062 gigawatt hours.

This was equivalent to 14% of Ireland’s electricity supply in 2024, up from 9.5% of electricity imported in 2023.

The EPA says if that amount of electricity had been generated in Ireland instead of being imported, it would have added an additional 1.5 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions to Ireland’s emissions in 2024.

In the transport sector, the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions was 1.2% last year.

This was the first reduction in emissions from the sector since 2020. Today’s report details a 4.1% increase in the national transport fleet last year.

Yet despite a rebound in the amount of traffic on Irish roads since Covid-19, emissions from the sector are still 5.4% below where they were before the pandemic.

Passenger cars are responsible for 49% of road transport emissions. Heavy goods vehicles and buses account for 31%. The remaining 20% of road transport emissions come from Ireland’s light goods vehicles and vans.

There was an increase of 48.5% in bioethanol mixed into petrol, and a 11.6% increase in the biodiesel mix.

Petrol consumption overall went up by 3% while diesel consumption went down by 2.5%.

'An implementation challenge'

The Director of the Office of Evidence and Assessment at the EPA has said that we know what needs to be done in relation to climate action, but this is now ""an implementation challenge"".

Speaking on RTÉ's Morning Ireland, Dr Eimear Cotter said that Ireland will be subject to fines if we miss our climate targets.

""There will be significant costs of compliance and potentially fines if we were not to achieve our targets,"" she said.

""For us in the EPA, we would see this as a huge, missed opportunity that that investment, those funds, should stay in the country, should be invested in Ireland and help our economy and reduce our own emissions.

""This is now an implementation challenge,"" Dr Cotter said.

""We know what we need to do. We've had climate action plans published for the last number of years. All of the policy and measures that have been elaborated, and those plans are there.

""This really now comes down to implementing those, delivering those on the ground to achieve those emission reductions.""

Environmental group Friends of the Earth said the EPA's figures showed Government action is falling far short of what is needed.

It said the 2% reduction in emissions, compared with a 6.8% in 2023 represents a loss of momentum when the country can least afford it.

Climate Policy Campaigner in Friends of the Earth Seán McLoughlin said: ""This data is a flashing red warning light. A 2% reduction, when we need to be making deep emissions cuts year-on-year, shows that Government is still stuck in climate go-slow mode. It’s a loss of momentum at the worst possible time.

""We are falling further and further behind on our climate commitments, while the world continues to warm at terrifying speed.""

""The onus is now on the Government to take actions that not only cut polluting emissions but also improve people’s everyday lives: insulating homes in vulnerable communities, rejecting energy-hungry data centres and rejecting fossil fuel infrastructure like LNG. These steps would mean cleaner air, warmer homes, and a better quality of life for everyone,"" he added.",https://www.rte.ie/images/0011cf80-1600.jpg,N,,2025-07-04 19:09:53.717539

“You either lead or follow. The road to following will just make you obey China. But India uniquely has the opportunity to create something that’s competitive,” he said in an exclusive conversation with ETManufacturing.

A market with momentum, but gaps to close

India’s automotive sector is now the third largest in the world, having surpassed Japan in 2023. The country produced nearly 5 million passenger vehicles and over 20 million two-wheelers in FY 2023. Sales of passenger vehicles crossed the 3 million mark last year, and despite global supply chain constraints, the market continues to post consistent year-on-year growth of 5–7 percent.

On the electric vehicle front, India registered over one million EV sales in 2023, a 25 percent jump over the previous year, with strong traction in the two-wheeler and three-wheeler segments.

However, Palmer noted that while the numbers are promising, India’s pace still lags far behind China, where EV sales have crossed 4 million units annually and where the government’s industrial push toward clean mobility began as early as 1992.

Batteries and the question of technological independence

For Palmer, the real battleground in the EV transition is not vehicle assembly, it’s batteries. China today controls nearly 70 to 80 percent of global lithium-ion battery production capacity. It also dominates the entire battery value chain, from raw material mining to refining and cell production. India, by contrast, has just two to three gigawatt-hours of installed cell manufacturing capacity. Despite the central government’s Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes aiming to create 50 GWh of battery output by 2030, progress has been slow and uneven.

“If India chooses to keep importing battery cells, it will be tied to the pricing and politics of others,” Palmer warned. “But if it invests now in next-generation chemistrieslike sodium-ion, NMC, solid-state, it could set the global benchmark. The question is whether you want to be a customer or a competitor.”

Palmer challenged India to rethink its dependence on imported battery technologies and instead lead the development of emerging alternatives. Sodium-ion batteries, which do not rely on lithium, present a unique opportunity. India, he argued, could position itself as a global pioneer in sodium-based energy storage or focus on advanced chemistries such as nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) and solid-state technologies to improve energy density and safety.

India as the next China+1 hub?

In the context of the global realignment of supply chains, what the world now refers to as the “China+1” strategy, Palmer believes India is in a prime position to benefit. Multinational companies are actively looking to de-risk their dependence on Chinese suppliers, and India has several structural advantages.

A large domestic market, competitive labour costs, and a deepening vendor ecosystem provides fertile ground for new investments. The country has already attracted over $5 billion in foreign direct investment into auto components over the past two years, doubling the previous five-year average.

However, Palmer cautioned that India must convert these macro advantages into focused capability building in areas like EV platforms, critical materials processing, and value-added localisation.

“India has the opportunity to either copy from the West and improve, or go its own way. But it must act with intent,” he said.

Software as a strategic advantage

Beyond hardware, Palmer believes one of India’s most underappreciated strengths is its deep talent pool in software and digital technologies. As the automotive industry moves towards software-defined vehicles, where everything from engine calibration to infotainment is run by code, India can lead.

“Define the vehicle of the future in the same way China did ten years ago. That’s where you find your niche,” he said.

Its $150 billion IT export ecosystem, headquartered in cities like Bengaluru and Pune, gives it an edge in embedded software, AI integration, and over-the-air update capabilities. Palmer urged Indian OEMs and startups to pivot their software focus away from enterprise systems like ERP or SAP and toward vehicle intelligence and user interface design.

Collaboration, not silos

While India’s potential is widely acknowledged, Palmer believes the country must now take the difficult but necessary step of building better institutional collaboration.

“The Chinese are really good at aligning government, industry, and academia. India needs to work harder at working together, but the rewards are worth it,” he said.

Unlike China’s one-party model, India’s democratic setup requires consensus, agility, and long-term vision to execute bold moves. To that end, Palmer sees the need for a more integrated approach, one where national and state governments align on EV policy, academia accelerates battery R&D, and the private sector scales innovations into commercial deployment.

Palmer’s message to India’s automotive sector is clear and uncompromising. The country can either play catch-up or become a serious challenger to China in the global EV race. It has the market scale, it has the talent, and it has the early signs of policy momentum. What it now needs is strategic commitment and a willingness to lead.

He concluded, “You’re at a turning point. You can be a fast follower or a fierce leader. India has all the ingredients if it chooses to act with intent.”

Mining for minerals used in the global energy transition, such as bauxite, copper and lithium, was the sector with the most lawsuits, representing more than 70% of all cases analyzed.
Across the world, 71% of transition mineral mining cases focused on the projects’ environmental impacts, while more than 60% included water access issues or water pollution.
While transition minerals mining had the most lawsuits, the other 29% of cases analyzed related to the renewable energy sector, such as wind, hydroelectric and solar.
In Latin America and the Caribbean, 24% of cases involved claims related to renewable energy projects.","A new report by the Business & Human Rights Resource Centre (BHRRC) finds that more than half of the 95 legal cases initiated around the world since 2009 by those impacted by the energy transition were documented in Latin America and the Caribbean (53%). Indigenous peoples filed almost half of all cases recorded worldwide (47%).

“People affected by transition minerals mining projects or renewable energy projects are increasingly resorting to courts to make sure that those projects respect their rights,” Elodie Aba, senior legal researcher at the BHRRC and lead author of the report, told Mongabay over a video call. “Most of the time, litigation is going to be the last resort for them. But when there’s no other choice, we can see that people are more aware of their rights now and [are] actually using the tools at their disposal for that.”

The researchers analyzed the BHRRC’s just transition litigation tool to assess the status of human rights lawsuits against transition mineral mining firms and renewable energy companies. Mining for minerals used in the global energy transition, such as bauxite, copper and lithium, was the sector with the most lawsuits, representing more than 70% of all cases analyzed. In Latin America and the Caribbean, 76% of cases involved transitional mineral mining.

Across the world, 71% of transition mineral mining cases focused on the projects’ environmental impacts, while more than 60% included water access issues or water pollution. Research has shown that mining processes, such as ore extraction and mineral processing, require significant amounts of water and can result in severe water contamination if not managed appropriately.

In southern Ecuador, Indigenous and local communities took legal action against the state for authorizing the Loma Larga copper mine that will largely impact the protected Quimsacocha páramo, which they depend on for water, agriculture and livestock production. Community members told Mongabay the project not only impacts water access, but also violates their right to free, prior and informed consultation. The provincial court ruled in favor of the community, but according to residents, the protective measures granted to them have not yet been implemented.

Gloria Velez, a community member from Girón, a canton in Azuay province neighboring Quimsacocha, has spent years defending the páramos under threat from Loma Larga. She told Mongabay over a phone call that the lagoons and water sources of Quimsacocha are sacred to her community. “It’s somewhere we [women] go to recharge ourselves with energy, strength and restore our connection with nature and our lands,” Velez said. “As community members, we feel there are many impacts of mining that are not openly talked about or consulted with us.”

Ecuador’s Ministry for Energy and Mines and Dundee Precious Metals Inc., the company behind the Loma Larga copper mine, did not respond to Mongabay’s requests for comment by the time of publication.

While transition minerals mining had the most lawsuits, the other 29% of cases analyzed related to the renewable energy sector, such as wind, hydroelectric and solar. Almost 80% of these cases alleged inadequate consultation of rightsholders and 36% raised the issue of access to water. In Latin America and the Caribbean, 24% of cases involved claims related to renewable energy projects.

Avoiding risks to projects and communities

In 2021, the Ecuadorian courts suspended a hydroelectric project in the Piatúa River, a tributary of the Amazon River in the region of Pastaza. As the Ministry of Energy and Mines and the company behind the project, Genefran S.A., did not comply with the requirement of prior consultation with the Kichwa people, who consider the river sacred, the courts withdrew authorization for the use and exploitation of the water flow and revoked the environmental license issued by the ministry to the company.

Ecuador’s Ministry of Energy and Mines and Genefran S.A. did not respond to Mongabay’s requests for comment about this case by the time of publication.

“What [our findings] mean as well is, if there’s a rise in affected communities taking the claims to court, then there’s also a legal risk for companies,” Aba said. “All of this has a cost. In addition to the legal risk, it can also slow down the project.

“The mining sector has a long legacy of serious impacts on the environment and Indigenous and frontline community rights, and given the growing surge in demand for transition minerals and the strength of Indigenous and community grassroots movements, it’s not surprising to see high numbers of lawsuits,” said Emily Greenspan, associate director for natural resource justice at Oxfam America. “If governments and companies want to ensure sustainable supply chains for transition minerals, they need to get better at engaging early and regularly with local communities. Communities must have the opportunity to influence whether and how mining projects move forward and to share in the benefits from these projects.”

If companies talk to affected communities from the start and throughout the project, there’s a way to avoid these risks, Aba said. “If you don’t engage them from the start, there’s a risk that these communities are going to resist your project and you can be faced with litigation, which doesn’t help your project in any way.”

Emily Iona Stewart, the head of policy and EU relations for Global Witness’ transition minerals campaign, who was not involved in this report, told Mongabay over email that “these figures tell us a lot about the nature of our energy transition, and the ways in which it is systematically harming Indigenous Peoples and frontline communities.”

Stewart said mining operations “must frontload meaningful community consultation and ensure free, prior, and informed consent for Indigenous Peoples, as well as being willing to change course when community opposition, environmental harm or social damage becomes clear.”

The BHRRC report urges governments, companies and investors to conduct robust human and environmental due diligence across the entire renewable energy value chain and to adopt a human rights-centered approach throughout project life cycles.

“Companies really need to have in mind that they should think about shared prosperity, fair negotiation and duty of care for human rights and environmental rights of people that will be directly affected,” Aba said. “It is about really undertaking robust human rights and environmental due diligence along the full value chain, but also making sure that they really engage, what we call meaningful consultation, with rightsholders.”

The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says Senate Republicans were employing an “accounting gimmick that would make Enron executives blush.” ___","WASHINGTON (AP) — Republicans muscled President Donald Trump’s tax and spending cut bill through the House on Thursday, the final step necessary to get the bill to his desk by the GOP’s self-imposed deadline of July 4th.

At nearly 900 pages, the legislation is a sprawling collection of tax breaks, spending cuts and other Republican priorities, including new money for national defense and deportations.

Democrats united against the legislation, but were powerless to stop it as long as Republicans stayed united. The Senate passed the bill, with Vice President JD Vance casting the tiebreaking vote. The House passed an earlier iteration of the bill in May with just one vote to spare. It passed the final version 218-214.

Here’s the latest on what’s in the bill and when some of its provisions go into effect.

GOP bill includes reductions for businesses and new tax breaks

Republicans say the bill is crucial because there would be a massive tax increase after December when tax breaks from Trump’s first term expire. The legislation contains about $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.

The existing tax rates and brackets would become permanent under the bill, solidifying the tax cuts approved in Trump’s first term.

It temporarily would add new tax deductions on tip, overtime and auto loans. There’s also a $6,000 deduction for older adults who earn no more than $75,000 a year, a nod to his pledge to end taxes on Social Security benefits.

It would boost the $2,000 child tax credit to $2,200. Millions of families at lower income levels would not get the full credit.

A cap on state and local deductions, called SALT, would quadruple to $40,000 for five years. It’s a provision important to New York and other high tax states, though the House wanted it to last for 10 years.

There are scores of business-related tax cuts, including allowing businesses to immediately write off 100% of the cost of equipment and research. Proponents say this will boost economic growth.

The wealthiest households would see a $12,000 increase from the legislation, and the bill would cost the poorest people $1,600 a year, mainly due to reductions in Medicaid and food aid, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office analysis of the House’s version.

GOP bill funds the border wall, deportations and a missile shield

The bill would provide some $350 billion for Trump’s border and national security agenda, including for the U.S.-Mexico border wall and for 100,000 migrant detention facility beds, as he aims to fulfill his promise of the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history.

Money would go for hiring 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, with $10,000 signing bonuses and a surge of Border Patrol officers, as well. The goal is to deport some 1 million people per year.

To help pay for it, immigrants would face various new fees, including when seeking asylum protections.

For the Pentagon, the bill would provide billions for ship building, munitions systems, and quality of life measures for servicemen and women, as well as $25 billion for the development of the Golden Dome missile defense system. The Defense Department would have $1 billion for border security.

Medicaid, SNAP face deep cuts to fund bill’s tax breaks and spending

To help partly offset the lost tax revenue and new spending, Republicans aim to cut back on Medicaid and food assistance for people below the poverty line.

Republicans argue they are trying to rightsize the safety net programs for the population they were initially designed to serve, mainly pregnant women, the disabled and children, and root out what they describe as waste, fraud and abuse.

The package includes new 80-hour-a-month work requirements for many adults receiving Medicaid and food stamps, including older people up to age 65. Parents of children 14 and older would have to meet the program’s work requirements.

There’s also a proposed new $35 co-payment that can be charged to patients using Medicaid services.

More than 71 million people rely on Medicaid, which expanded under Obama’s Affordable Care Act, and 40 million use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Most already work, according to analysts.

The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 11.8 million more Americans would become uninsured by 2034 if the bill became law and 3 million more would not qualify for food stamps, also known as SNAP benefits.

Republicans are looking to have states pick up some of the cost for SNAP benefits. Currently, the federal government funds all benefit costs. Under the bill, states beginning in 2028 will be required to contribute a set percentage of those costs if their payment error rate exceeds 6%. Payment errors include both underpayments and overpayments.

But the Senate bill temporarily delays the start date of that cost-sharing for states with the highest SNAP error rates. Alaska has the highest error rate in the nation at nearly 25%, according to Department of Agriculture data. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, had fought for the exception. She was a decisive vote in getting the bill through the Senate.

The ‘big beautiful’ bill slashes clean energy tax credits

Republicans are proposing to dramatically roll back tax breaks designed to boost clean energy projects fueled by renewable sources such as energy and wind. The tax breaks were a central component of President Joe Biden’s 2022 landmark bill focused on addressing climate change and lowering health care costs.

Democratic Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden went so far as to call the GOP provisions a “death sentence for America’s wind and solar industries and an inevitable hike in utility bills.”

A tax break for people who buy new or used electric vehicles would expire on Sept. 30 of this year, instead of at the end of 2032 under current law.

Meanwhile, a tax credit for the production of critical materials will be expanded to include metallurgical coal used in steelmaking.

The bill creates ‘Trump Accounts’ — and funds a national hero garden

A number of extra provisions reflect other GOP priorities.

The bill creates a new children’s savings program, called Trump Accounts, with a potential $1,000 deposit from the Treasury.

The Senate provided $40 million to establish Trump’s long-sought “National Garden of American Heroes.”

There’s a new excise tax on university endowments and a new tax on remittances, or transfers of money that people in the U.S. send abroad. The tax is equal to 1% of the transfer.

A $200 tax on gun silencers and short-barreled rifles and shotguns was eliminated.

One provision bars for one year Medicaid payments to family planning providers that provide abortions, namely Planned Parenthood.

Another section expands the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, a hard-fought provision from GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, for those impacted by nuclear development and testing.

Billions would go for the Artemis moon mission and for the exploration of Mars, while $88 million is earmarked for a pandemic response accountability committee.

Additionally, a provision would increase the nation’s debt limit, by $5 trillion, to allow continued borrowing to pay already accrued bills.

State AI regulations cut from bill after a GOP uproar

The Senate overwhelmingly revolted against a proposal meant to deter states from regulating artificial intelligence. Republican governors across the country asked for the moratorium to be removed and the Senate voted to do so with a resounding 99-1 vote.

A provision was thrown in at the final hours that will provide $10 billion annually to rural hospitals for five years, or $50 billion in total. The Senate bill had originally provided $25 billion for the program, but that number was upped to win over holdout GOP senators and a coalition of House Republicans warning that reduced Medicaid provider taxes would hurt rural hospitals.

The amended bill also stripped out a new tax on wind and solar projects that use a certain percentage of components from China.

Final price tag: GOP bill could add $3.3 trillion to deficit

Altogether, the Congressional Budget Office projects that the bill would increase federal deficits over the next 10 years by nearly $3.3 trillion from 2025 to 2034.

Or not, depending on how one does the math.

Senate Republicans are proposing a unique strategy of not counting the existing tax breaks as a new cost because those breaks are already “current policy.” Republican senators say the Senate Budget Committee chairman has the authority to set the baseline for the preferred approach.

Under the alternative Senate GOP view, the bill would reduce deficits by almost half a trillion dollars over the coming decade, the CBO said.

Democrats say this is “magic math” that obscures the true costs of the tax breaks. Some nonpartisan groups worried about the country’s fiscal trajectory are siding with Democrats in that regard. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says Senate Republicans were employing an “accounting gimmick that would make Enron executives blush.”

Other forms of renewable energy did not become significant contributors to U.S. energy production until more recently.","In 2024, the United States consumed about 94 quadrillion British thermal units (quads) of energy, a 1% increase from 2023, according to EIA's Monthly Energy Review.

Fossil fuels—petroleum, natural gas, and coal—accounted for 82% of total U.S. energy consumption in 2024. Nonfossil fuel energy—from renewables and nuclear energy—accounted for the other 18%. Petroleum remained the most-consumed fuel in the United States, as it has been for the past 75 years, and nuclear energy consumption exceeded coal consumption for the first time ever.

When the Declaration of Independence was signed in 1776, wood, a renewable energy source, was the largest source of energy in the United States. Used for heating, cooking, and lighting, wood remained the largest U.S. energy source until the late 1800s, when coal consumption became more common. Wood energy is still consumed, mainly by industrial lumber and paper plants that burn excess wood waste to generate electricity.

Coal was the largest source of U.S. energy for about 65 years, from 1885 until 1950. Early uses of coal included many purposes that are no longer common, such as in stoves for home heating and in engines for trains and ships. Since the 1960s, nearly all coal consumed in the United States has been for electricity generation.

Petroleum has been the most-consumed source of energy in the United States since 1950. Petroleum products such as motor gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and propane are commonly used across all sectors of the U.S. economy, from transportation to industrial chemicals and plastics.

Natural gas is the second-largest source of U.S. energy consumption, as it has been most years since it surpassed coal in 1958. Natural gas was once considered a waste byproduct of crude oil production but now has become a common energy source for heating and electricity generation.

Early use of water to power grist, lumber, and other milling operations is not well quantified and not included in EIA data, but such mills were common throughout early U.S. history. The first industrial use of hydropower to generate electricity in the United States was to power lamps at a chair factory in Grand Rapids, Michigan, in 1880. The world’s first hydroelectric power plant to sell electricity to the public opened on the Fox River near Appleton, Wisconsin, in 1882.

Other forms of renewable energy did not become significant contributors to U.S. energy production until more recently. In 2016, biofuels—including the fuel ethanol mixed in motor gasoline—became the most-consumed U.S. renewable energy source.

Electricity generation from some zero-carbon sources, such as wind and solar, has increased rapidly in recent years, while generation from others, such as hydropower and nuclear, has remained relatively flat. In 2022, U.S. energy consumption from renewable sources surpassed nuclear energy for the first time since 1984, and in 2023, renewables surpassed coal for the first time since around the early 1880s. The United States now consumes more energy from wind and solar sources individually than from hydropower.",https://www.bicmagazine.com/downloads/24050/download/power%20plant.jpg?cb=7715d5ca5fd5000fcaecf2022a99cb08&w=1200,N,,2025-07-04 17:11:27.195524

Other provisions of the program, including tax credits for wind energy and solar components, are scheduled to expire earlier.

On Tuesday, the Senate passed an amended version of the legislation by a 51–50 vote, with Vice-President J.D. Vance casting the tie-breaking vote. The bill now enters reconciliation between the House and Senate, with final wording expected later this summer.

Letter to Senate

Some 30 industry executives have warned in a letter to the Senate that removing the Section 45X credit could undermine efforts to finance and develop domestic mineral production, especially in the face of global competition from state-subsidized suppliers in China and elsewhere.

The May letter was authored by KaLeigh Long, founder and CEO of Westwin Elements, which is building the country’s first major nickel refinery. It was signed by companies such as global metals trader Traxys Group and processing startups Magrathea and Momentum Technologies.

“Nickel isn’t niche. It’s national security,” Westwin wrote in a LinkedIn post. “Let’s fix it. Let’s restore 45X.”

Several projects in the US had relied on the incentive as part of their long-term financial modelling, particularly in emerging markets such as magnesium and battery-grade lithium.

The proposed repeal also comes amid broader US efforts to secure critical mineral supply chains and reduce dependence on foreign-controlled refining capacity. Critics have said the budget proposal sends mixed signals about Washington’s commitment to reshoring strategic mineral production, despite earlier permitting reforms and subsidy announcements intended to encourage domestic investment.

Industry support

The National Mining Association (NMA) applauded the Senate’s July 1 passage of its version of the “One Big Beautiful Bill” and urging House action to send the bill to President Trump’s desk.

“We urge the House to quickly pass this bill,” NMA president and CEO Rich Nolan said in a statement. It “increases the competitiveness of the American mining industry and provides vital incentives, including funding to counter China’s mineral dominance.”

In December 2023, the NMA had criticized the then proposed 45X tax credit for excluding raw materials from the list of eligible production costs. The Biden administration then reversed course with rules passed in October 2024 that allowed direct and indirect material costs, including domestic extraction costs.

Canada impact

The repeal of the US credit could create a limited opening for Canadian companies to increase exports to US customers – particularly in lithium, nickel and rare earth elements. However, under current rules, many US incentives – including portions of the Section 45X program and electric vehicle tax credits – apply only to minerals that are extracted or processed in the US or in countries with a free trade agreement.

While Canada qualifies under the latter category, some Canadian firms may still face barriers if their operations do not meet the specific content or processing requirements under US law.

Analysts have noted that any relative advantage for Canadian miners would likely depend on their ability to scale up processing infrastructure or integrate into US-based value chains, particularly in refining and downstream component manufacturing. The repeal of the credit also adds new uncertainty to cross-border mineral cooperation efforts, which had gained momentum in recent years under bilateral critical mineral strategies.

The “One Big Beautiful Bill” will require further debate and a final vote before being sent to the White House. A timeline for implementation of the credit phase-out would depend on the final language of the reconciled bill.",https://www.mining.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/USSSS-CONGRESS.jpg,N,,2025-07-04 16:10:27.994849

Bill cuts solar and wind tax credits, keeps nuclear and geothermal

Energy Innovation projects 300 GW capacity fall due to bill

Oil and gas industry praises bill for advancing energy dominance agenda

WASHINGTON, July 3 (Reuters) – Advocates of clean energy on Thursday decried the final passage of President Donald Trump’s tax cut bill by the House of Representatives as a reversal of course on the energy transition, while fossil-fuel interests rejoiced.

Trump’s fellow Republicans in the House passed the bill 218-214 and it now heads to the president’s desk. Trump is expected to sign it on Friday.

The legislation sharply cuts access to a 30% tax credit for solar and wind power projects that had been set to run until 2032 and which developers had relied on.

Research firm Energy Innovation projected that the bill would result in a fall of 300 gigawatts of U.S. electricity capacity, as demand soars for the first time in two decades, driven by growth in data centers and artificial intelligence.

Meanwhile, demand for power from data centers is estimated at upward of 100 GW, according to nonprofit group American Clean Power.

The bill’s passage “is a dramatic swing in federal policy, disrupting the good-faith investments of American companies that are powering our economy and creating hundreds of thousands of jobs,” said Jason Grumet, ACP’s president.

Jefferies global investment bank said in a research note to clients that the phaseout of the wind and solar subsidies will lead to a “medium-term rush” to claim credits, which could speed the roll-out of projects for a couple of years. After that period, investors will need to reassess such projects without them.

It said nuclear and geothermal power, energy sources that the Trump administration favors for dependable electricity generation, received better access to credits in the legislation. Battery storage projects will also retain the full tax credit through 2033 and phase out fully by 2036.

The “longer runway” for those baseload resources to use the tax credits won praise from the Data Center Coalition, whose members include Amazon (AMZN.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O).

Mike Sommers, the president and CEO of the American Petroleum Institute, the top oil and gas lobbying organization, said Congress had advanced Trump’s “energy dominance agenda” of maximizing oil and gas output.

Production of oil and gas had already hit a record during the administration of former President Joe Biden.

“We applaud Congress for unleashing our nation’s oil and natural gas resources, and we look forward to President Trump signing this bill into law,” Sommers said in a release.

COAL GETS A BREAK

Some tax credits favored by the oil industry, like those for hydrogen and carbon capture, were preserved in the bill.

The bill also mandates sales of oil and gas drilling rights in federal lands and in waters off Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico, which Trump has renamed the Gulf of America.

It allows coal used in steel making a new production tax break of 2.5% of costs that could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars for the industry. It also reduced royalty rates that coal companies have to pay when mining on public lands.

Rich Nolan, the president and CEO of the National Mining Association lobbying group, said the bill supports “today’s mining industry which stands ready to create additional jobs and revenues for our economy.”

Daniel Francis, a director with Generate Capital, said the focus for wind and solar industries will shift to states and communities.

“Ultimately the impact of the bill will be to move decisions down the federal chain from Congress to states, counties and cities,” he said. “Because economies run on power, because voters care about their power bills, and there is no alternative.”

But the bill that passed Congress on Thursday would repeal the part of the 2022 law that established the green bank and rescind money that hadn’t already been obligated to its recipients.

Climate United Fund and other nonprofits in March sued the Environmental Protection Agency, its administrator Lee Zeldin and Citibank, which held the program’s money. The lawsuit argued the defendants had illegally denied the groups access to billions awarded last year through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, commonly referred to as a “green bank.” The program was created by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

But the bill that passed Congress on Thursday would repeal the part of the 2022 law that established the green bank and rescind money that hadn’t already been obligated to its recipients.

The EPA said the bill should hand them a victory in their court fight that is being heard by a federal appeals court in Washington. Now that Congress has rescinded funding, an earlier federal judge’s decision forcing the EPA to release money to the groups should be reversed, the agency said in its Thursday court filing.

Climate United Fund disagrees. It acknowledges that the bill in Congress is a “significant policy setback” but argues that most of the money had been disbursed and is unaffected by the bill. And if the EPA wanted to take the money back, there’s a different process the agency would need to follow.

“Our funds have already been obligated and disbursed. Any effort to claim otherwise is simply a lie to justify illegal attempts to claw back funds intended to benefit communities across the country,” CEO Beth Bafford said in a statement.

According to the EPA, when the agency terminated the grants the funds “became unobligated.”

“Grantees have desperately performed legal gymnastics to hold tens of billions of taxpayer dollars hostage. In the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill, Congress made their intent crystal clear in repealing the program entirely and returning those billions in unobligated funds to the U.S. Treasury,” EPA spokesperson Brigit Hirsch said in a statement.

The green bank’s goals run counter to the Trump administration’s opposition to policies that address climate change and its embrace of fossil fuels. Zeldin quickly made the bank a target, characterizing the $20 billion in grants as a scheme marred by conflicts of interest and potential fraud.

In February, Zeldin told Fox News that he suspected the green bank “was a clear cut case of waste and abuse” that “in my opinion, is criminal.” The following month, Zeldin terminated the grants.

U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan has previously said that when the federal government was asked for evidence of fraud, the agency didn’t provide it and shifted its position. Chutkan decided the government can’t terminate the contracts and that the groups should have access to some of their frozen money.

That order was put on hold during the EPA’s appeal.

The agency argues the nonprofits are making constitutional and statutory arguments that don’t apply in what it sees as a simple contract fight.

If the government successfully argues the case is a contract dispute, then the EPA says it should be heard by a different court that can only award a lump sum – not force the government to keep the grants in place. Federal officials argue there is no law or provision in the Constitution that compels the EPA to make these grants to these groups.

In its court filing, the EPA also pointed to comments by Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, chair of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, as supportive of the agency’s position. Capito said previously the bill intended to rescind billions in funding that had been frozen.

“This action reflects not only Congress’s deep concern with reducing the deficit, but EPA’s administration of the (green bank) under the Biden administration, the agency’s selection of grant recipients, and the absence of meaningful program oversight,” the agency quotes the senator as saying.

The Run on Less – Messy Middle Bootcamp series has brought together experts from across the trucking, energy, and manufacturing sectors to explore viable decarbonization strategies already in play across the country.

The final session, the Bootcamp Finale Workshop, will take place July 15 and promises to tie together insights from the past six months while preparing fleets for the Run on Less – Messy Middle demonstration coming in September.

Each session has tackled specific themes across three broad fuel categories — diesel and natural gas, battery-electric vehicles (BEVs), and hydrogen — with a focus on real-world applicability and lessons learned from fleets already embracing these technologies.

The Bootcamp kicked off with a close look at low-carbon diesel and natural gas solutions. These early sessions covered the role of renewable diesel and biodiesel in reducing emissions today, along with the opportunities and limitations of renewable natural gas. Experts weighed in on infrastructure availability, price trends, and the evolving emissions regulatory landscape.

The series then turned its focus to battery-electric trucks, diving into the state of the technology, infrastructure challenges, depot charging models, and real-world deployment strategies. Industry leaders from utilities, OEMs, and logistics companies shared lessons from the field, highlighting what’s working and what’s still evolving.

Next the NACFE team shifted to hydrogen’s potential in the heavy-duty space. Sessions examined how hydrogen is produced, transported, and delivered to fleets, as well as the market and policy conditions needed to make hydrogen a scalable alternative. From onboard storage to fueling station logistics, presenters provided a realistic look at both the promise and complexity of this emerging fuel.

On Tuesday, July 15 at 10 am PT/1 pm ET, NACFE will host the final Bootcamp webinar. This culminating session will highlight the top 10 insights from across the series, offer early impressions from site visits to the fleets participating in the upcoming Run on Less demonstration, and preview what’s to come in September.",https://www.act-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Final-Workshop.png,N,,2025-07-04 17:10:56.015224
,Congress,2025-07-04 17:48:25+00:00,WTOP News,EPA says Trump's big bill should help in its fight to freeze billions in green bank funds,The Associated Press,,,,,https://wtop.com/national/2025/07/epa-says-trumps-big-bill-should-help-in-its-fight-to-freeze-billions-in-green-bank-funds/,"The lawsuit argued the defendants had illegally denied the groups access to billions awarded last year through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, commonly referred to as a “green bank.” The program was created by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.
But the bill that passed Congress on Thursday would repeal the part of the 2022 law that established the green bank and rescind money that hadn’t already been obligated to its recipients.
The EPA said the bill should hand them a victory in their court fight that is being heard by a federal appeals court in Washington.
And if the EPA wanted to take the money back, there’s a different process the agency would need to follow.
In the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill, Congress made their intent crystal clear in repealing the program entirely and returning those billions in unobligated funds to the U.S. Treasury,” EPA spokesperson Brigit Hirsch said in a statement.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The sprawling tax and policy bill that passed Congress repeals a multibillion-dollar green bank for financing climate-friendly projects, and the Trump administration should be allowed to freeze its funding and cancel related contracts with nonprofits, federal officials said in a court filing.

Climate United Fund and other nonprofits in March sued the Environmental Protection Agency, its administrator Lee Zeldin and Citibank, which held the program’s money. The lawsuit argued the defendants had illegally denied the groups access to billions awarded last year through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, commonly referred to as a “green bank.” The program was created by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

But the bill that passed Congress on Thursday would repeal the part of the 2022 law that established the green bank and rescind money that hadn’t already been obligated to its recipients.

The EPA said the bill should hand them a victory in their court fight that is being heard by a federal appeals court in Washington. Now that Congress has rescinded funding, an earlier federal judge’s decision forcing the EPA to release money to the groups should be reversed, the agency said in its Thursday court filing.

Climate United Fund disagrees. It acknowledges that the bill in Congress is a “significant policy setback” but argues that most of the money had been disbursed and is unaffected by the bill. And if the EPA wanted to take the money back, there’s a different process the agency would need to follow.

“Our funds have already been obligated and disbursed. Any effort to claim otherwise is simply a lie to justify illegal attempts to claw back funds intended to benefit communities across the country,” CEO Beth Bafford said in a statement.

According to the EPA, when the agency terminated the grants the funds “became unobligated.”

“Grantees have desperately performed legal gymnastics to hold tens of billions of taxpayer dollars hostage. In the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill, Congress made their intent crystal clear in repealing the program entirely and returning those billions in unobligated funds to the U.S. Treasury,” EPA spokesperson Brigit Hirsch said in a statement.

The green bank’s goals run counter to the Trump administration’s opposition to policies that address climate change and its embrace of fossil fuels. Zeldin quickly made the bank a target, characterizing the $20 billion in grants as a scheme marred by conflicts of interest and potential fraud.

In February, Zeldin told Fox News that he suspected the green bank “was a clear cut case of waste and abuse” that “in my opinion, is criminal.” The following month, Zeldin terminated the grants.

U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan has previously said that when the federal government was asked for evidence of fraud, the agency didn’t provide it and shifted its position. Chutkan decided the government can’t terminate the contracts and that the groups should have access to some of their frozen money.

That order was put on hold during the EPA’s appeal.

The agency argues the nonprofits are making constitutional and statutory arguments that don’t apply in what it sees as a simple contract fight.

If the government successfully argues the case is a contract dispute, then the EPA says it should be heard by a different court that can only award a lump sum – not force the government to keep the grants in place. Federal officials argue there is no law or provision in the Constitution that compels the EPA to make these grants to these groups.

In its court filing, the EPA also pointed to comments by Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, chair of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, as supportive of the agency’s position. Capito said previously the bill intended to rescind billions in funding that had been frozen.

“This action reflects not only Congress’s deep concern with reducing the deficit, but EPA’s administration of the (green bank) under the Biden administration, the agency’s selection of grant recipients, and the absence of meaningful program oversight,” the agency quotes the senator as saying.

Investment thesis: Overweight renewable energy infrastructure stocks with federal/provincial contract exposure.","Canada's transition to a net-zero economy by 2050 is no longer theoretical—it's a regulatory and financial juggernaut. Over the past year, federal and provincial policies have created a perfect storm of incentives, funding, and mandates that are turbocharging growth in wind and solar energy infrastructure. For investors, this isn't just an environmental shift; it's a multi-decade opportunity to profit from one of the world's most ambitious clean energy agendas.

The Regulatory Backdrop: Clean Electricity Regulations (CER) as a Catalyst

At the heart of Canada's strategy is the Clean Electricity Regulations (CER), finalized in December 2024. These rules are a game-changer: they impose annual emissions limits (AEL) on fossil fuel-based power plants, effectively phasing out coal and gas over the next three decades. By 2035, any plant exceeding its AEL must purchase compliance credits or offset emissions—a financial penalty that will drive utilities to pivot to renewables.

The CER's three-tiered approach (existing, planned, and new units) ensures a gradual transition while avoiding grid instability. Crucially, it's projected to reduce cumulative GHG emissions by 181 megatonnes by 2050, a figure that underscores the scale of the opportunity.

Federal Funding: Billions on the Table

The federal government isn't relying solely on regulation—it's backing its policies with $60 billion in funding for grid modernization, clean energy projects, and affordability programs. Key programs include:

- Clean Technology Investment Tax Credit (ITC): Offers up to 30% tax credits for commercial renewable projects, including solar and wind.

- Canada Greener Homes Loan Program: Provides zero-interest loans up to $40,000 for homeowners installing solar panels, contingent on energy audits—a win for both residential solar installers and energy efficiency firms.

- Smart Renewables and Electrification Pathways (SREP): Funds community-scale renewables, targeting underserved regions.

These programs aren't just subsidies—they're demand accelerants. With 400,000 clean energy jobs projected by 2050, the sector is set to become a linchpin of Canada's economy.

Provincial Incentives: A Patchwork of Profitability

While federal policies set the stage, provincial incentives are the rocket fuel. Here's where the action is:

Alberta:

- Banff Solar Production Incentive: A $0.75/Watt rebate for residential and commercial installations up to 20kW, paired with community outreach requirements.

- Power Generation Partner Program (PGPP): A 20-year contract for clean energy producers at a bid cap of $0.0983/kWh, ensuring predictable revenue streams for wind and solar developers.

British Columbia:

- BC Hydro Solar & Battery Rebate Program: Up to $5,000 for solar and $5,000 for battery storage, with eligibility tied to grid-connected homes.

Saskatchewan:

- Power Generation Partner Program (PGPP): Aims to add 35 MW of clean energy by 2025, targeting wind and solar.

These rebates and contracts are direct revenue multipliers for companies in the value chain—solar panel manufacturers, wind turbine suppliers, and grid infrastructure firms.

Investment Opportunities: Where to Play

Solar Manufacturing and Installation:

Key Plays: Companies like Canadian Solar (SCLPF) and Hanwha Q CELLS (HQCLF) benefit from federal tax credits and provincial rebates.

Wind Farm Development:

Utility-Scale Projects: Firms like Northland Power (NPI.TO) and Boralex (BLX.TO) are prime beneficiaries of the CER's emissions limits.

Grid Modernization:

Smart Grid Tech: Companies like Powin Energy and Enersystems are poised to profit from the $60B grid upgrade fund.

Tax-Advantaged Projects:

Class 43.2 Accelerated CCA: Allows businesses to write off solar equipment at 100% in the first year, reducing upfront costs.

Risks and Considerations

Execution Risk: Provincial policies vary widely. For example, Alberta's coal-heavy grid requires aggressive renewables growth, while Quebec's 94% hydro reliance creates less immediate demand.

Geopolitical Tailwinds: Global demand for clean energy infrastructure (e.g., EVs, hydrogen) could amplify Canada's role as a supplier of solar panels and wind components.

Final Analysis: A Buy Signal for the Next Decade

Canada's renewable energy sector is no longer a niche play—it's a systemic transformation fueled by policy, capital, and urgency. For investors, the path is clear:

Prioritize firms with exposure to federal tax credits and provincial rebates.

Look for companies with long-term contracts (e.g., PGPP) or grid infrastructure expertise.

Monitor execution risks but stay long-term bullish—the CER's 2050 timeline ensures decades of steady demand.

The numbers don't lie: 181 megatonnes of avoided emissions, 400,000 jobs, and $60 billion in funding are not just statistics—they're the building blocks of a new energy economy. The wind is at your back.

What is Great British Energy – Nuclear?

Great British Energy – Nuclear (GBE-N) is intended to supports the UK's nuclear industry by providing better opportunities to build and invest and is an executive non-departmental public body, sponsored by the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero.

It is responsible for managing delivery of the government’s plans to provide taxpayer support to the first wave of small modular reactors (SMRs) to be built in England and Wales.

It received £2.5bn under the Spending Review, and the government says the investment could revitalise Britain’s industrial heartlands.

Officials say the programme could create up to 3,000 skilled jobs and provide enough electricity to power approximately 3M homes.

Unlike traditional nuclear plants, SMRs are smaller – generally 300MW – and designed for quicker construction, which is expected to reduce costs over time as multiple units are deployed.

The technology is seen as a key element in the UK’s efforts to enhance energy security while achieving its climate goals.

Rolls-Royce SMR beat competition from GE Hitachi, Westinghouse Electric Co., and Holtec International, which were the final four technologies in contention.

Recognition agreement to cover full range of workplace matters

Prospect says it is the largest trade union in the civil nuclear sector and represents members across the NDA (Nuclear Decommissioning Authority) estate, Urenco, Springfields Nuclear Fuels, ONR (Office for Nuclear Regulation), NNL (National Nuclear Laboratory), the UKAEA (UK Atomic Energy Authority) and the wider supply chain.

The union said it also “represents thousands of civil and public servants in both central departments and a range of arms-length bodies making it the perfect fit for GBE-N.”

The recognition agreement means Prospect is now the official trade union for staff at GBE-N, which is headquartered in Warrington.

“The agreement covers negotiation on pay, pension and terms and conditions as well as consulting in areas of policy and reorganisation,” the union said.

Union boss says unions critical to health and safety

Prospect general secretary Mike Clancy said: “This recognition agreement is an important symbol that with government investment must come good quality unionised jobs.

“Energy is an industry where the success of unions can be plainly seen, particularly when you look at health and safety. That’s why it is so important that the government body responsible for supporting the nuclear industry has led by example in recognising Prospect.

“We look forward to working with GBE-N as we forge a new era in nuclear generation.”

GBE-N chief says unions play ‘important role’

Great British Energy – Nuclear CEO Gwen Parry-Jones said: “As we enter our next phase, I’m delighted to have signed this recognition agreement on behalf of Great British Energy - Nuclear.

“Trade Unions have such an important role to play in our sector, I have a long and very positive relationship with Prospect and I look forward to this carrying on within GBE-N.”

Minister highlights ‘essential’ role unions play

Energy secretary Ed Miliband said: “I am delighted to see that Great British Energy - Nuclear and Prospect have signed a recognition agreement.

“This is not only an important step towards ensuring economic security for workers across the country, but it is also a recognition of the essential role that trade unions are playing in driving forward good terms and conditions for workers, and clean energy for the country.”

“This Government's clean energy mission means good, unionised jobs in clean energy, from small modular reactors to renewables to carbon capture and storage.”

Chair told MPs small minority of staff on permanent contracts

In November 2024, GBE-N (then called Great British Nuclear/GBN) chair Simon Bowen revealed to MPs that only 20% of staff at the government body were employed on permanent contracts.

Bowen said: “The headcount currently runs at about 140, 30 of which are permanent employees.”

Explaining why only roughly one-in-five (21%) of the staff are permanent, he added: “It took us many, many months to get a pay agreement through the various government processes, understandably, which really slowed down our recruitment, but we're now starting to accelerate and to bring people into the organisation.”",https://cdn.ca.emap.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/UK-SMR-Concept-rolls-royce-2-560x315.jpg,N,,2025-07-04 18:10:05.258874

A big reason for this growth has been federal clean energy tax credits. Nearly three years ago, legislation containing tax credits crucial to the success of not only solar, but Pennsylvania’s broader clean energy industry as well, was signed into law. These credits incentivized more and more businesses and homeowners to install solar arrays on rooftops or in fields, invest in energy efficiency upgrades or purchase electric vehicles.

Now, all this economic activity is at risk. When the U.S. House of Representatives in mid-May passed its version of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the federal clean energy tax credits that have done so much to fuel job and business growth in the Lehigh Valley’s renewable energy industry were effectively repealed.

The Senate also acted to do away with most of the clean energy tax credits when it voted Tuesday, July 1, 2025, to pass President Trump’s domestic policy bill.

Businesses across Pennsylvania relied in good faith on those credits being available for the full decade they were promised. For businesses like mine, changing the rules after we’ve already made investments means we’ll now struggle to make it to the end of the year — let alone another two decades — with our growth prospects intact.

The Senate version of the bill now returns to the House where representatives must agree to pass it. We need Republican legislators to show more than 100,000 clean energy workers in our state that their jobs are valued by politicians in Washington, and that the only path to American energy dominance includes federal clean energy tax credits for technologies such as solar, which has been installed on at least 33,000 homes, businesses, and schools across Pennsylvania and is the fastest-growing source of power in the U.S. today.

As outlined in a letter my company and more than 100 other businesses from across Pennsylvania recently sent to our congressional delegation, here’s what Congress urgently needs to change in the bill:

•The elimination of credits for residential clean energy, energy efficiency, and electric vehicles. This change will increase costs for families and weaken the resiliency of our energy infrastructure. For consumers and small businesses, it is a must to keep all consumer-facing credits that have done so much for my Hellertown-based business and the competition I’ve welcomed in recent years.

•No industry has ever faced such restrictive provisions on parts manufactured in so-called “Foreign Entities of Concern” – i.e., China. The burdens these restrictions place on manufacturers and developers are simply unworkable.

•In the bill, ludicrous deadlines are imposed on when projects must be placed into service to be eligible for credits. Even projects already underway will ultimately become ineligible for the tax credit, despite starting in good faith under the requirements that existed when shovels first hit the ground. Factors outside a project developer’s control — think about everything from a stretch of unusually bad weather to labor and supply chain issues — make it impossible to guarantee any project will qualify for credits under the new deadlines. Congress must keep in place the standard for credit eligibility that businesses have relied upon and restore the timeframes for when credits are available.

•In the bill, new restrictions make a financial mechanism called “transferability” unusable except for nuclear projects. Without transferability, financing will sink to levels far below market need. Congress must retain transferability for all technologies, not just nuclear.

I was heartened to see many of these changes articulated in a June 6 letter signed by Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick and Rep. Rob Bresnahan Jr. However, I couldn’t help noticing our own Republican congressman, Rep. Ryan Mackenzie, did not sign the letter. He should know that the four counties he represents — Monroe, Carbon, Northampton and Lehigh — are home to a combined 10,000-plus clean energy jobs, according to the national, nonpartisan business group E2.

And let’s be clear: While many in the House are quick to sign letters supporting clean energy, the fact is every member of Pennsylvania’s Republican caucus voted to advance an awful bill that would pull the rug out from under the state’s industry.

The window to change the legislation is closing rapidly. What’s at stake is nothing less than tens of thousands of Pennsylvania jobs and small, family-owned businesses like mine. Right now, it’s up to our representatives in the House to get the job done. They must restore federal clean energy tax credits.

The new budget moves funds away from Medicaid, clean energy tax credits, and other public services and toward Trump’s attempt to mass-deport both documented and undocumented immigrants.
While much of the budget fight concerned Medicaid and the national debt, there were also protracted negotiations over a planned 10-year moratorium on states regulating AI systems.
Congress also scrapped a ban on Medicaid funding for gender-affirming care, though it will deny Medicaid funding to reproductive health care group Planned Parenthood.","The Republican-controlled US Congress has passed a budget bill that includes cuts to social programs like Medicaid and more funding for Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE), alongside provisions that discourage wind and solar energy production. Passed after a marathon debate in both houses, it will allow President Donald Trump to realize policy goals he’s so far attempted to push through executive orders and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Trump intends to sign the bill in a 5PM ET ceremony on Friday, July 4th.

The new budget moves funds away from Medicaid, clean energy tax credits, and other public services and toward Trump’s attempt to mass-deport both documented and undocumented immigrants. The bill extends a number of tax cuts that primarily benefit wealthy Americans while reducing spending and eligibility for Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), likely kicking millions off both programs despite objections from some initial Republican holdouts. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO), who ultimately voted for the bill, expressed concerns that “we can’t be cutting health care for working people and for poor people in order to constantly give special tax treatment to corporations and other entities.”

During a period of intense demand for electricity — including from companies like Meta, OpenAI, and other Silicon Valley AI giants — the budget also makes it more difficult for wind and solar companies to receive tax credits. It winds down tax credits for EVs, likely rendering electric options more expensive for car buyers. And it requires the FCC to sell 800MHz of spectrum that will likely be drawn from the 6GHz band, which is currently left free to provide more capacity for Wi-Fi services.

While much of the budget fight concerned Medicaid and the national debt, there were also protracted negotiations over a planned 10-year moratorium on states regulating AI systems. Lawmakers ultimately voted against that rule, which was opposed by not only Democrats but many state-level Republican politicians. An excise tax on wind and solar power companies that couldn’t meet strict requirements barring “material assistance” from certain foreign entities including China was similarly removed, although the bill still deals a serious blow to the renewable energy industry. Congress also scrapped a ban on Medicaid funding for gender-affirming care, though it will deny Medicaid funding to reproductive health care group Planned Parenthood.

Meanwhile, the budget provides $45 billion for immigration detention facilities and around $30 billion for ICE personnel and operations costs, on top of tens of billions of dollars in other immigration enforcement-related funding that the nonprofit American Immigration Council says will overall make ICE “the highest-funded law enforcement agency in the entire federal government.”

This increase will allow Trump to continue an ever-expanding mass deportation program, which has seen masked ICE agents target immigrants in workplaces, courtrooms, and on city streets. The administration has widened its net to catch not only undocumented residents, but people who hold visas or green cards or were granted temporary protected status, as well as naturalized citizens; Trump mused earlier this week that his “next job” could be expelling native-born citizens for crimes like murder and said he would consider deporting his former “First Buddy” Elon Musk. Since the Supreme Court recently denied a nationwide injunction on Trump’s termination of 14th Amendment birthright citizenship, the administration could even target a freshly created class of stateless newborn babies later this month.

In addition to expanding arrests, the funding will likely also help continue the creation of new surveillance and detention systems, like a centralized national citizen database that has been reportedly constructed with help from DOGE. As Congress debated the budget bill this week, Trump toured a newly opened Florida detention center built with FEMA funds; the rapidly erected facility — which Republicans celebrated by releasing merchandise with the nickname “Alligator Alcatraz” — flooded during a rainstorm soon after.",https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/gettyimages-2223450459.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200,N,,2025-07-04 17:10:36.589613

Now, on Independence Day, a signing ceremony is expected for President Donald Trump to sign the bill into law, formalizing many aspects of the platform Trump campaigned on in 2024.

The OBBBA contains much car-related legislation. Some federal requirements for automakers are relaxed, some tax credits are going away, and there’s a new incentive for Americans to buy cars made in the U.S.

It’s been predicted since Trump’s reelection that the days are numbered for the federal EV tax credit provided by the IRS. When the OBBBA is signed into law, America’s EV tax credit will officially go away on September 30th, 2025. Previously, it was scheduled to sunset in 2032. Time will tell whether automakers will adjust MSRPs accordingly, especially GM, which offers EVs in three brands across a wide price range.

The bill also eliminates fines for automakers failing to meet corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards first established in 1975. As recently as last Summer, GM had to pay a $145.8 million fine to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) because of excess emissions from several million 2012 through 2018 model-year full-size pickups and midsize crossovers.

Another Trump promise formalized in the OBBBA is tax-deductible interest on loans for American-made cars. When car shoppers buy a car assembled in the United States, they’ll be able to deduct up to $10,000 annually for tax years 2025-2028. This is well above what the average new car buyer pays in interest in a given year. It’s an “above-the-line” deduction, which means you can take the deduction in addition to the standard deduction and don’t need to itemize.

Another significant car-related piece of the OBBBA involves restrictions on EV battery manufacturing credits. Battery components made with help from “a prohibited foreign entity” won’t be eligible for manufacturing credits, namely China. A more specific list of prohibited entities will be established after the bill is signed into law.

Bloomberg News

(TNS)

The Trump administration’s plan to scrap federal incentives for electric vehicles will be a major speed bump for battery-powered transportation in the U.S., but not a brick wall, according to forecasts.

On Thursday, Republicans in the U.S. House sent a bill to President Donald Trump’s desk that kills tax credits of up to $7,500 for EV customers that were part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

The White House has said former President Joe Biden’s initiative “promised much but delivered nothing.” However, the tax credits helped fuel an EV market far more robust and affordable than drivers enjoyed before the rebates kicked in two and a half years ago. Repealing them, along with a flurry of other anti-EV policies put in place or being pursued by the Trump administration, will put a serious dent in sales.

U.S. adoption is set to trail the global average through 2040 and will knock the nation out of the top three EV markets, according to a recent BloombergNEF report. Last year’s version of the report had the country boasting higher-than-average sales starting in 2029.

Still, Elaine Buckberg, a former General Motors economist now at Harvard University’s Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability, estimates that even with federal tax cuts disappearing, some 37% of new cars bought in 2030 will be electric. That’s down from a forecast of 48% if the current incentives remained. The factors propping up some of the demand are fairly straightforward: Electric cars are far better and cheaper than they used to be, and there are many more models to choose from.

“In the most likely scenario, you end up about two years behind on adoption,” Buckberg said. ”I think [EVs] will be more resilient than people are thinking.”

The average price U.S. drivers pay for an EV has ticked slightly lower in the IRA era, from $64,700 in January 2023 to $59,900 in April, a 7.4% decline without adjusting for inflation, according to Edmunds.com. However, the range of options has widened dramatically.

When the IRA was passed, there were 34 types of EVs for sale in the U.S., with just 11 models below the average vehicle price of $47,500. Today, there are twice as many electric models to choose from, and 19 have below-average sticker prices. EV incentives in 17 states can bring the cost down even further for some buyers.

“You just have more non-luxury offerings,” Buckberg said. “You’re more likely to find the brand you want, the style you want, the size you want.”

Stephanie Valdez Streaty, a director at Cox Automotive, said carmakers and dealers are offering discounts that are often as generous or more so than government incentives. Dealer incentives on a Nissan Leaf, she said, mean “you can get that vehicle for less than $20,000” in some cases.

BNEF expects U.S. EVs will be as cheap or cheaper than gas-powered iterations by roughly 2028 (Goldman Sachs estimates that rubicon could be crossed even sooner).

There’s evidence that a majority of Americans are at least electric-curious. Nearly 60% of U.S. vehicle shoppers are “very” or “somewhat” likely to purchase an EV, according to a May JD Power survey—levels unchanged from a year ago. What’s more, concerns about purchase price and cost of ownership have declined over the past 12 months.

Still, the loss of federal incentives will hit the lower end of the market particularly hard. “The people who have the means to go buy a Rivian or a Lucid are still going to go do that,” said Ingrid Malmgren, the senior policy director at advocacy group Plug In America. “The impact, like so much of the rest of this bill, is inordinately going to be paid for by lower-income Americans.”

Rolling back EV tax credits is also only part of how the Trump administration is favoring internal combustion models. It has frozen a $5 billion federal plan to build charging stations, primarily along rural interstate corridors and in low-income communities. The White House has also promised to lower regulations on tailpipe emissions and moved to block a California policy to ban gasoline-powered car sales by 2035.

Factoring in all of these policy shifts will slow EVs’ momentum even further than the IRA cuts: BNEF forecasts that just 27% of the U.S. market to be electric by 2030, down from the 48% share it estimated a year ago, and Buckberg expects a similar slowdown.

Outside the U.S., however, EVs remain on a tear thanks to a drop in battery prices and a wave of low-price models rolling out of Chinese factories. BNEF expects one in four new cars sold this year—some 22 million cars and trucks—to come with a plug, a 25% increase over 2024. Two-thirds of those sales will be in China.

A little bird

You may recall last week, a New York Times article reported that Uber co-founder and former CEO Travis Kalanick is working with investors to buy the U.S. arm of Chinese autonomous vehicle company Pony AI, and Uber might even help make it happen.

Several little birds tell me Kalanick ally and Uber ATG veteran Eric Meyhofer is involved. We’re poking around to learn more. In the meantime, here is a little history lesson. Meyhofer was with the National Robotics Engineering Center at Carnegie Mellon University before officially moving over to Uber in 2015. He eventually became CEO of Uber ATG, the self-driving unit that was later sold off to Aurora. Meyhofer has been connected to Kalanick’s CloudKitchens enterprise via a restaurant automation and robotics business called Lab37, which was initially reported by the Spoon back in 2023.

Notable reads and other tidbits

Autonomous vehicles

A catchy new term was coined during a recent recording of the Autonocast, the podcast I co-host with Alex Roy and Ed Niedermeyer (full credit goes to Roy). The term is MVAT, or minimum viable autonomy theater — when companies deploy the minimum viable autonomy product sufficient to perpetuate a narrative of progress.

One possible example: Tesla let a Model Y SUV drive roughly 15 miles from its factory to the apartment complex where the car’s new owner lives, completing what CEO Elon Musk called the first “autonomous delivery” of a customer car. If this is a one-off, aka a demonstration, then it’s an MVAT.

This isn’t just to pick on Tesla, by the way. Many other companies have posted flashy videos to showcase the capabilities of their respective automated driving technology. But it was a far more common practice in 2015 — as AVs were shooting up to the top of the hype cycle.

Electric vehicles, batteries, & charging

The second quarter has ended and that means sales and production numbers! While many automakers issue monthly reports, some of the EV companies we monitor only provide quarterly numbers.

The electric Hummer is almost outselling the F-150 Lightning

Lucid sales inch forward as EV maker pushes to ramp Gravity production

Rivian receives the next $1B from Volkswagen as sales struggles continue

Tesla faces second straight year of falling sales after another bad quarter

Meanwhile, Republican legislators passed a reconciliation act that, among other things, unwinds much of the Inflation Reduction Act, including that solar, wind, and clean hydrogen will all lose incentives under the new bill. EV tax credits are also eliminated for new and used electric vehicles and the installation of home EV-charging equipment.

The end of the EV tax credit is already rippling through the industry, including companies that don’t even have an EV yet to sell. Slate Auto, the Jeff Bezos-backed EV startup, was planning to sell a pickup truck for less than $20,000 with the EV tax credit applied. But the language on its website has changed to reflect the bill’s passage.

Also a bit of news from the world of electric RVs and vans … Pebble, the California-based startup we’ve written about before, has started customer deliveries of its flagship all-electric travel trailer. And Grounded, the startup founded by former SpaceX engineers and based in Detroit, delivered its new electric van, called the G3, to its first customer.

SungEel Recycling Park Georgia LLC had planned to spend $37 million and hire more than 100 people at a facility in Toccoa.

Stephens County officials announced in April that the project was stalled, and as of July 3, the industrial authority was reportedly in the process of buying back two sites in the Hayestone Brady Industrial Park developed with the help of a $700,000 state grant.

“We look forward to marketing those sites and finding another company that were are excited to work with as we were Sungeel,” Stephens County Development Authority president and CEO Brittany Ivey told WLHR radio.

The news came months before the passage of President Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” on July 3, which phases out $7,500 subsidies for new electric-vehicle purchases by Sept. 30, sooner than earlier versions of the bill. The subsidies had previously been set to sunset in 2032.

Republicans had long telegraphed the repeal of what they called EV “mandates” and tax breaks for solar energy even as some of Georgia’s most conservative members of Congress urged President Trump to preserve at least the production tax credits for the latter as a way to counter China and bolster his goal of American “energy dominance.”

Critics say the bill threatens progress in the South’s so-called “Battery Belt,” in which Georgia is a key node thanks to South Korean investors that have committed to at least three separate sites. Only one, SK Battery in Commerce, is operational so far.

It also hits solar energy, which has been a booming business in Georgia largely thanks to billions in investment by Qcells, a Korean firm that has become the largest maker of panels in North America.

Qcells’ moves to set up its solar production base in Georgia seem to have served it well, as future subsidies seem to be contingent on when factories started construction and how well they decouple from Chinese supply chains, another stated goal of Qcells parent company Hanwha for its Georgia plants.

The demand side is where question marks arise. On the EV battery, front Hyundai is developing two separate factories with SK (Cartersville) and LG Energy Solution (next to its Bryan County factory) potentially worth a combined $10 billion for the state.

Kia and Hyundai, meanwhile, have invested heavily in electric vehicles but also boast flexible assembly lines that can make hybrids, Evs and internal combustion vehicles with little disruption. Record sales in June for Kia saw hybrids rise and slowdowns for its EV6 and EV9 models, the production of which was brought to Georgia last year.

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp has often touted the state’s emerging ecosystem for electric mobility even as he has panned the Biden-era subsidies as picking market winners and losers.

The governor has argued that market forces should shape electric-vehicle demand and pointed out that many of its signature projects, including the Hyundai Meta Plant near Savannah, were announced before the passage of President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act in August 2022.

Sungeel HiMetal’s announcement came Aug. 18, two days after the IRA was signed into law.

Georgia has announced 33 clean-energy projects worth $12.8 billion since 2022, meaning it has much to lose from policies that discourage new factory development, according to advocacy group E2.

“This bill is a stunningly reckless blow to America’s economy and our environment,” said Bob Keefe, E2’s executive director. “At a time of skyrocketing energy demand, Congress is dismantling the policies driving a manufacturing renaissance in America and that are critical to 90 percent of the new power being added to our grid.”

Sungeel’s cancellation comes after Norway’s Freyr Battery pulled the plug on a $2.6 billion factory in Newnan and Aspen Aerogels nixed a south Georgia investment. Nippon Denkai also canned a copper foil factory in Augusta that was largely targeted toward meeting rising demand for electric vehicle batteries.

This marks the largest year-over-year drop in sales in Tesla’s history, although it is up 14.1% from its first quarter total.

Industry registration data indicates that both US and European sales have fallen sharply, despite an overall increase in electric vehicle (EV) sales in both markets. Tesla also faces increased competition, not only from legacy Western automakers but also from Chinese manufacturers. This competition has significantly impacted Tesla’s sales in China, the largest market for both EVs and auto sales, and Tesla’s second-largest market.

Tesla is poised to lose its title as the world’s largest EV maker based on annual sales to Chinese automaker BYD, even though BYD does not sell cars in the US market. BYD has reported it has sold one million EVs in the first half of this year, exceeding Tesla’s year-to-date total of around 721,000 units.

Analysts point out that while Tesla has recently given its popular Model Y an update, it lacks a more affordable product offering – which has created an opportunity for rivals such as BYD, especially in China. BYD also sold more fully electric cars in Europe than Tesla for the first time ever in April.

Democrats uniformly opposed the bill, while all but two House Republicans supported it.
“This bill will leave America a far crueler and weaker place,” said Robert Weissman, co-president of the nonprofit Public Citizen, in a statement.

“Every lawmaker who voted for this cynical measure chose tax cuts for the wealthiest over Americans’ health, pocketbooks, public lands, and waters — and a safe climate.","The U.S. House of Representatives voted 218-214 on Thursday to pass President Donald Trump’s sweeping domestic policy bill, greenlighting deep cuts to America’s social safety net and the decimation of the country’s only federal climate strategy. Democrats uniformly opposed the bill, while all but two House Republicans supported it.

“This bill will leave America a far crueler and weaker place,” said Robert Weissman, co-president of the nonprofit Public Citizen, in a statement. It “races the United States and the world toward climate catastrophe, ending support for renewable energy that is absolutely vital to avert worst-case climate scenarios.”

The so-called Big Beautiful Bill has now been approved by both chambers of Congress; all it needs now is Trump’s signature before it can become law. Trump is expected to sign it during an evening ceremony on July 4, Independence Day, according to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt.

One of Republicans’ biggest victories in the bill is the extension of deep tax cuts enacted during Trump’s first term, which are estimated to cost the country more than $4 trillion over 10 years. The legislation also directs roughly $325 billion to the military and to border security, while cutting nearly $1 trillion in funding for Medicaid, the joint state and federal program that covers medical costs for lower-income people.

To pay for the tax breaks, the bill sunsets clean energy tax credits that were put in place by the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, making wind and solar projects ineligible unless they start construction before July 2026 or are placed in service by 2027. It also imposes an expedited phaseout of consumer tax credits for new and used electric vehicles — by September 30 this year instead of by 2032. Green groups described the legislation as “historically ruinous” and “a self-inflicted tragedy for our country.”

The IRA’s tax credits and additional incentives for green energy from the bipartisan infrastructure act, also passed under former president Joe Biden, were projected to reduce the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions by 42 percent by 2030. Combined with additional action from states, cities, and private companies, they could have put the U.S. on track to meet the country’s emissions reduction target under the United Nations Paris Agreement.

Once Trump signs the megabill, however, the U.S. will have no federal plan to address the climate crisis.

“Every lawmaker who voted for this cynical measure chose tax cuts for the wealthiest over Americans’ health, pocketbooks, public lands, and waters — and a safe climate. They should be ashamed,” said Manish Bapna, president of the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council, in a statement.

Agriculture experts have also objected to Trump’s policy bill, which removes the requirement that unobligated climate-targeted funds from the IRA be funneled toward climate-specific projects — in part so they can be directed toward programs under the current farm bill, an omnibus bill for food and agriculture that the federal government renews every five to six years. The Trump megabill seeks to increase subsidies to commodity farms by about $50 billion.

The final version of the bill doesn’t include a proposal to sell off millions of acres of public lands; this was dropped following outcry from the public and some conservation-minded GOP lawmakers. It also lacks stringent limits on the use of Chinese components in renewable energy projects that were proposed in an earlier version of the bill. Some Republican lawmakers in both the House and Senate voted for the legislation in exchange for carveouts in their states, like reduced work requirements for food stamps and less severe health care cuts.

In the Thursday House vote, only two Republicans broke with their party to vote against Trump’s megabill: Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who opposes measures that would increase the federal deficit, and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, who had hesitated to support cuts to Medicaid.

All Democrats voted against the bill. Immediately preceding the House vote, Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York railed against the policy in a record-breaking 8-hour-and-45-minute House floor speech invoking scripture: “Our job is to stand up for the poor, the sick, and the afflicted,” he said.

Members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus have promised to hold Republicans accountable. More than three dozen of its members have said they’ll hold “Accountability Summer” events lambasting Republican lawmakers who supported the bill. “As Democrats, we must make sure they never live that down,” the group’s chair, Greg Casar, a Democrat of Texas, said in a statement.

Similarly, Senator Brian Schatz, a Democrat for Hawaiʻi, told The New York Times that his party should use the megabill’s spending cuts as a cudgel against Republicans ahead of next year’s midterm elections: “Our job is to point out, when kids get less to eat, when rural hospitals shutter, when the price of electricity goes up, that this is because of what your Republican elected official did,” he said.

Dadan revealed that ESDM ministry is planning to build 49,000 kilometers of new transmission lines to connect clean energy sources with demand centers.
“The aim is win-win: Singapore gets clean energy, and Indonesia gets economic and industrial growth.
Flexibility and TKDN Responding to concerns around local content (TKDN) in renewable energy development, Kusdiana urged a balanced approach.
In closing, Kusdiana rejected the notion that clean energy is economically burdensome.","Indonesia is repositioning clean energy not only as a climate solution, but also a central pillar of its national development strategy, said Dadan Kusdiana, Secretary-General of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM).

Addressing the ""Mentari Day"" event in Jakarta on Thursday, July 3, 2025, Dadan outlined an integrated energy transition vision that combines energy access, sustainability, and economic growth, particularly through industrial downstreaming.

“Energy transition is not just about reducing emissions. For Indonesia, it is about enabling inclusive economic development and boosting competitiveness,” he said. “The only way forward is to view renewable energy as an enabler − not a cost − for national growth.”

The government, he said, is aligning two of its top priorities under President Prabowo Subianto’s leadership: energy security and downstream industrialization.

He argued these agendas must converge to drive a just and rapid transition. “We can’t talk about energy transition in isolation. Downstreaming is how we accelerate it,” he said.

He cited recent milestones, including the launch of a solar panel manufacturing facility and a battery production ecosystem, as examples of how Indonesia is developing clean energy industries at home.

“We have the world’s largest nickel reserves. Now we’re building out the full value chain, from mining to battery manufacturing,” he said. These developments, Dadan emphasized, will allow Indonesia to move beyond being a raw material exporter and position itself as a major player in global clean energy supply chains.

Rural electrification

A core focus of ESDM’s upcoming agenda is accelerating rural electrification, especially in Eastern Indonesia. He acknowledged that significant gaps remain in energy access across regions like East Nusa Tenggara (NTT), and that government programs must close this divide to ensure no one is left behind.

“The eastern region is our last mile. Places like Mata Reddy Village in Sumba are symbolic of the 5,600 villages still lacking adequate access,” Dadan said. “Our goal is to reduce this number one by one − every day, every year − through diverse programs and partnerships.”

He also referenced Sumba Iconic Island, an initiative launched in 2009 to pilot off-grid renewable electrification. Building on that model, ESDM ministry is preparing dedicated budgets and implementation plans − led by the Directorate General of Electricity − to scale up access across similar regions. He emphasized that off-grid renewable systems will play a central role in delivering clean and reliable power where grid extension is not feasible.

Dadan highlighted the importance of institutional sustainability in rural energy projects, drawing lessons from Mentari’s implementation.

“Too often, government infrastructure projects are rushed to meet year-end deadlines. What’s missing is clarity on who manages them, who maintains them,” he noted. “Mentari has shown us the value of community-based models. We must ensure government investments are durable and locally owned.”

Infrastructure, grid modernization

Beyond village electrification, the ministry is investing in grid infrastructure to support the integration of renewables. Dadan revealed that ESDM ministry is planning to build 49,000 kilometers of new transmission lines to connect clean energy sources with demand centers.

“Many of our renewables are far from the load centers. Transmission is the enabler of national energy resilience,” he said.

He reiterated that energy policy must be comprehensive, inclusive, and sustainable, with planning across sectors − fossil fuels, renewables, electricity, and minerals − now fully integrated.

“We no longer treat coal, renewables, or gas as separate silos. Policy development is now conducted in parallel,” he said.

He acknowledged the continued role of coal and gas during the transition, but stressed the need to reduce emissions through technologies like carbon capture and storage (CCS) and co-firing with biomass. On gas, Dadan said new discoveries, especially in Eastern Indonesia, could serve as a transitional bridge while clean technologies scale up.

Exports and industrial development

Dadan also addressed the evolving dynamics of Indonesia’s cross-border electricity trade, particularly with Singapore. He said ESDM ministry is working to ensure that electricity exports do not merely benefit receiving countries but also stimulate domestic industrial development.

“When we export electricity, we must also attract investment,” he said. “We don’t want to be just power exporters. We want to build industries at home that are powered by that clean electricity.”

He cited that this principle guided recent negotiations with Singapore on CCS and sustainable industrial development. “The aim is win-win: Singapore gets clean energy, and Indonesia gets economic and industrial growth. That’s how we multiply the benefits,” he said.

Flexibility and TKDN

Responding to concerns around local content (TKDN) in renewable energy development, Kusdiana urged a balanced approach. “TKDN should not be viewed as a barrier. Yes, we must absorb domestic products, but not at the cost of delaying projects,” he said.

He cited that ESDM ministry is working to align TKDN enforcement with project acceleration, ensuring that local industries grow alongside − not at the expense of − the clean energy transition. He also acknowledged Mentari’s support in providing studies and technical insights for this process.

In closing, Kusdiana rejected the notion that clean energy is economically burdensome. “Renewables are not expensive − they are the growth engine of the future,” he said. “Energy transition is not a cost. It’s an opportunity for Indonesia to leap ahead.”

He called on stakeholders across ministries, regions, and private sectors to carry forward the momentum of Mentari into the next phase. “We’re not here to repeat the past. We’re here to scale it, replicate smarter, and design better programs for greater impact.”",https://cdn.indonesiabusinesspost.com/3/2/3/4/DadanKusdiana_300x206.webp,N,,2025-07-04 17:11:10.172362

The advisory opinion builds on two landmark decisions last year.
In April 2024, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the Swiss government violated senior citizens' human rights by refusing to abide by scientists' warnings to rapidly phase out fossil fuel production.
The IACtHR advisory opinion is expected to boost climate and human rights lawsuits throughout the Americas, and to impact talks ahead of November's United Nations Climate Change Conference, or COP30, in Belém, Brazil.
Markus Gehring, a fellow and director of studies in law at Hughes Hall at the University of Cambridge in England, called the advisory opinion ""highly inspiring"" and ""seminal.""","In a landmark advisory opinion published Thursday, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights—of which the United States, the world's second-biggest carbon polluter, is not a member—affirmed the right to a stable climate and underscored nations' duty to act to protect it and address the worsening planetary emergency.

""States must refrain from any conduct that reverses, slows down, or truncates the outcome of measures necessary to protect human rights in the face of the impacts of climate change,"" a summary of the 234-page ruling states. ""Any rollback of climate or environmental policies that affect human rights must be exceptional, duly justified based on objective criteria, and comply with standards of necessity and proportionality.""

""The court also held that... states must take all necessary measures to reduce the risks arising, on the one hand, from the degradation of the global climate system and, on the other, from exposure and vulnerability to the effects of such degradation,"" the summary adds.

""States must refrain from any conduct that reverses, slows down, or truncates the outcome of measures necessary to protect human rights in the face of the impacts of climate change.""

The case was brought before the Costa-Rica based IACtHR by Chile and Colombia, both of which ""face the daily challenge of dealing with the consequences of the climate emergency, including the proliferation of droughts, floods, landslides, and fires, among others.""

""These phenomena highlight the need to respond urgently and based on the principles of equity, justice, cooperation, and sustainability, with a human rights-based approach,"" the court asserted.

IACtHR President Judge Nancy Hernández López said following the ruling that ""states must not only refrain from causing significant environmental damage but have the positive obligation to take measures to guarantee the protection, restoration, and regeneration of ecosystems.""

""Causing massive and irreversible environmental harm...alters the conditions for a healthy life on Earth to such an extent that it creates consequences of existential proportions,"" she added. ""Therefore, it demands universal and effective legal responses.""

The advisory opinion builds on two landmark decisions last year. In April 2024, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the Swiss government violated senior citizens' human rights by refusing to abide by scientists' warnings to rapidly phase out fossil fuel production.

The following month, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea found in an advisory opinion that greenhouse gas emissions are marine pollution under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and that signatories to the accord ""have the specific obligation to adopt laws and regulations to prevent, reduce, and control"" them.

The IACtHR advisory opinion is expected to boost climate and human rights lawsuits throughout the Americas, and to impact talks ahead of November's United Nations Climate Change Conference, or COP30, in Belém, Brazil.

Climate defenders around the world hailed Thursday's advisory opinion, with United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk calling it ""a landmark step forward for the region—and beyond.""

""As the impact of climate change becomes ever more visible across the world, the court is clear: People have a right to a stable climate and a healthy environment,"" Türk added. ""States have a bedrock obligation under international law not to take steps that cause irreversible climate and environmental damage, and they have a duty to act urgently to take the necessary measures to protect the lives and rights of everyone—both those alive now and the interests of future generations.""

Amnesty International head of strategic litigation Mandi Mudarikwa said, ""Today, the Inter-American Court affirmed and clarified the obligations of states to respect, ensure, prevent, and cooperate in order to realize human rights in the context of the climate crisis.""

""Crucially, the court recognized the autonomous right to a healthy climate for both individuals and communities, linked to the right to a healthy environment,"" Mudarikwa added. ""The court also underscored the obligation of states to protect cross-border climate-displaced persons, including through the issuance of humanitarian visas and protection from deportation.""

Delta Merner, lead scientist at the Science Hub for Climate Litigation at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said in a statement that ""this opinion sets an important precedent affirming that governments have a legal duty to regulate corporate conduct that drives climate harm.""

""Though the United States is not a party to the treaty governing the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, this opinion should be a clarion call for transnational fossil fuel companies that have deceived the public for decades about the risks of their products,"" Merner added. ""The era of accountability is here.""

Markus Gehring, a fellow and director of studies in law at Hughes Hall at the University of Cambridge in England, called the advisory opinion ""highly inspiring"" and ""seminal.""

Drew Caputo, vice president of litigation for lands, wildlife, and oceans at Earthjustice, said that ""the Inter-American Court's ruling makes clear that climate change is an overriding threat to human rights in the world.""

""Governments must act to cut carbon emissions drastically,"" Caputo stressed. ""While the United States and some other major polluters have chosen to ignore climate science, the rest of the international community is advancing protections for all from the realities of climate harm.""

President Trump is getting the Independence Day signing ceremony he's been demanding.

MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:

This is for the megabill he and Republicans in Congress pushed over the finish line yesterday afternoon. Speaking under the wing of Air Force One as he departed for a victory rally in Iowa, Trump said the celebration would include a military aircraft flyover.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And it's going to be a great day. So we'll be signing with those beautiful planes flying right over our heads.

MARTIN: The One Big Beautiful Bill, as President Trump has been calling it, contains the president's entire domestic legislative agenda.

MARTÍNEZ: With more, we're joined now by NPR senior White House correspondent Tamara Keith. So, Tam, what is the president saying about this bill's passage?

TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Well, as you might imagine, he and his allies are taking a victory lap. Trump was in Iowa last night for a rally and said with this bill, he kept every major promise he made to voters when he ran for office last year.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

TRUMP: Very simply, the One Big Beautiful Bill will deliver the strongest border on earth, the strongest economy on earth, the strongest military on earth, and ensure the United States of America will remain the strongest country anywhere on this beautiful planet of ours.

(CHEERING)

KEITH: Trump was, to borrow a word he likes to use, rather braggadocious about his success last night, asking, has anybody ever had a better two weeks?

MARTÍNEZ: Now, 48 hours ago, though, there was some drama. I mean, it looked like that bill and the president's timeline were in trouble. So what happened?

KEITH: Well, there were quite a few Republican holdouts, but President Trump turned on the charm, and then he turned up the pressure. And ultimately, all but two Republicans in the House who had been holding out folded. At a press conference after the bill passed, Majority Leader Steve Scalise gave Trump all the credit.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

STEVE SCALISE: Donald Trump absolutely was our closer, and Donald Trump never stopped - every day was there in the fight. Who do I need to call? What do I need to do? No president more directly engaged.

KEITH: This was a pivotal moment in Trump's presidency and he and his party rose to it. It took all-night debates and arm-twisting and passed with incredibly narrow margins in both the House and the Senate. And the question now is whether it becomes a long-term political win or more of an albatross.

MARTÍNEZ: Oh, OK. Sounds like you're talking about the midterm elections.

KEITH: Indeed. Next year, Republicans in swing districts will have to defend their votes. And so far, public polling has found this bill to be pretty unpopular. Democrats have had a lot of success in branding it as a tax cut for the rich at the expense of the poor and the vulnerable. A senior White House official conceded in a call yesterday with reporters that the president and Republicans are going to have to educate the public on what's actually in the bill, including things that are popular, like no tax on tips or expanding the child tax credit.

And another thing to watch is the Medicaid cuts in the bill, which an independent analysis found would cause nearly 12 million people to lose coverage. Those will phase in more slowly, which may give Republicans some political cover because people often don't draw a direct line between things happening in their lives and something politicians in Washington passed years earlier.

MARTÍNEZ: Yeah. Now, still a lot of uncertainty, though, various global conflicts, the U.S. tariff policy. What challenges lie ahead, though?

KEITH: Well, it depends on how you feel about tariffs. Early next week, Trump's tariff pause is set to end and his administration has not had much success striking trade deals. So he says he's just going to start sending letters to countries telling them how high their tariffs will be going forward. Economists say tariffs are going to hit American consumers, but Trump is unconcerned.

Trump is also burning up the phones to various world leaders, trying to wind down the conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine, and then there's Iran - all of which is to say, a president's work is never done.

,Louisiana Environment,2025-07-04 16:53:23+00:00,WWNO,Louisiana created a market to reduce water pollution. Will it actually work? | WWNO,"Elise Plunk (Louisiana Illuminator), www.wwno.org, elise-plunk-louisiana-illuminator",,,,,https://www.wwno.org/coastal-desk/2025-07-04/louisiana-created-a-market-to-reduce-water-pollution-will-it-actually-work,"The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) hopes to improve water quality throughout the state with a new water quality trading program, using a market-based strategy to encourage less nitrogen and phosphorus pollution in waterways.
Nutrient pollution Nitrogen and phosphorus are nutrients often found in things like fertilizer for agriculture or a product of wastewater treatment.
Other sources of pollution, called “nonpoint source” pollution, like that from farming fertilizer runoff, do not have any requirement to limit nutrient pollution in Louisiana.
LDEQ also does a water quality assessment every two years to see if bodies of water are “supporting” or “not supporting” the narrative requirements.
Even with the problems in Louisiana’s program, environmental advocates and scientists alike agree that trying a market strategy to control nutrient pollution isn’t a baseless idea.","Imagine you love cherry cheesecake, and you’re happy to find out that your local bakery makes the delicious, decadent dessert every Saturday. But they only make a certain amount per week; after that, there’s no more.

Your neighbors also love cherry cheesecake. So, in order to get more for yourself from the limited supply, you pay them not to order a cake on Saturday, giving their share to you instead.

Balancing the amount of cheesecake consumption using this kind of trade works in a similar way to water quality trading, which looks to reduce pollution in the environment— in theory. It gets a lot more complicated than cheesecake.

“One entity removes certain pollutants from the environment, and then a company that discharges that pollutant could buy those credits to offset their pollution,” said Matt Rota, senior policy director for environmental group Healthy Gulf.

The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) hopes to improve water quality throughout the state with a new water quality trading program, using a market-based strategy to encourage less nitrogen and phosphorus pollution in waterways.

It’s a type of plan that environmentalists, scientists and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) says can be a useful tool. But whether the program is fully set up for success isn’t yet certain.

Nutrient pollution

Nitrogen and phosphorus are nutrients often found in things like fertilizer for agriculture or a product of wastewater treatment. Farmers, wastewater treatment companies and other types of facilities produce nitrogen and phosphorus as a byproduct; that byproduct often gets washed or dumped into nearby waterways.

Too much nitrogen and phosphorus in the water can cause toxic algae blooms, areas of low oxygen also known as dead-zone and acidification of coastal estuaries and wetlands, among other problems

The dead zone in the upper Gulf of Mexico, now renamed the Gulf of America by the Trump administration, is the “poster child” for the issue, said Rota. The area of low oxygen that appears every summer in the Gulf from nutrient pollution in the Mississippi River covers an area usually about the size of Delaware.

“It’s a really important issue, the zone of hypoxia,” said John Sabo, professor at Tulane’s Department of River-Coastal Science and Engineering, and director of the Tulane ByWater Institute. Low oxygen in the water can kill fish, shrimp and other sea life, affecting Louisiana’s seafood industry and the ecology of the Gulf.

Previous efforts to reduce it haven’t made much progress. Vast amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus wash into the Mississippi River from further North in the Mississippi River Basin. All of that runs down to Louisiana, making it hard to control that much pollution within a single state.

The Hypoxia Task Force, a group of federal agencies, states and tribes throughout the Basin, represents one of the larger groups trying to address the dead zone by forecasting and mapping the annual size of the zone. It also works with farmers to adopt new strategies to reduce the amount of nutrient runoff from agricultural fields and works with universities and businesses to advance technology to contain nutrient runoff.

The goal of the Task Force is to reduce the dead zone’s size by 20 percent of what it was in 2015 by this year, and no larger than about 1,900 square miles by 2035. Forecasts for this year predict the zone to be about 4,800 square miles.

Problems with fully funding the annual cruise to gather data on the true size of the zone could also make it harder to tell whether reduction strategies are working.

Problems in the program

The idea behind LDEQ’s market strategy is that Louisiana can use financial incentives to reduce nutrient pollution and help alleviate problems like the dead zone.

“The goal is to reduce pollutants across the state,” said Rachel Mathews, LDEQ environmental scientist manager and the program lead for the water quality trading initiative.

But environmental advocates noted some gaps that could hinder the program’s success.

Louisiana doesn’t currently have numeric limits for nutrient pollution in waterways. Having a specific, measurable number is important for keeping a market working correctly, according to Rota and Sabo.

Certain individual permits from “point source” polluters, or places like wastewater treatment plants and manufacturing facilities, might have a measurable maximum they are allowed to dump, but Louisiana has no broad, standard requirement for these facilities to limit nutrient pollution.

Other sources of pollution, called “nonpoint source” pollution, like that from farming fertilizer runoff, do not have any requirement to limit nutrient pollution in Louisiana.

“If their permits aren’t requiring them to ramp down their nitrogen or phosphorus discharge, there’s no market,” said Rota.“Louisiana hasn’t put together a good regulatory regime to ensure that these credits would need to be purchased.”

It’s like the local bakery making cheesecake all week in unlimited amounts; there’s no incentive to pay your neighbor not to get a cake if you can eat as much as you want.

Louisiana started the process of developing numeric maximums for the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus allowed in bodies of water in 2003, mutually agreeing with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to finish a draft of nutrient criteria for all waterways except the Mississippi and Atchafalaya rivers by 2013. Rota said that goal still hasn’t been met.

“Louisiana has theoretically been working on those for 20 years. And, you know, we have seen very little progress,” said Rota.

Mathews said Louisiana does follow a “general narrative criteria,” or more qualitative descriptions like good, bad, moderate or severe, for maintaining the amount of nutrient pollution in the state’s waters.

“It’s a good start, the narrative approach, but it should be evolved towards quantitative and measurement,” said Sabo.

LDEQ also does a water quality assessment every two years to see if bodies of water are “supporting” or “not supporting” the narrative requirements. Mathews said that can help LDEQ decide if certain, more heavily polluted areas need to be a higher priority for cleanup.

“It was just the most efficient tool that we had available at the time,” said Mathews.

But relying on numbers is central to making a program like this successful. A report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office looking at water quality trading programs found that without limits on the amount of nutrients allowed into waterways, there’s no demand for point source polluters to buy credits.

Getting nonpoint source polluters involved was another issue the report cited, because it’s so difficult to tell how much nutrient pollution they actually produce, creating “uncertainties about the value of credits.”

Can it be fixed?

Even with the problems in Louisiana’s program, environmental advocates and scientists alike agree that trying a market strategy to control nutrient pollution isn’t a baseless idea.

“I love working with the market rather than against it,” said Cassie Glaspie, assistant professor in Louisiana State University’s Department of Oceanography & Coastal Sciences.

Still, she said there’s a need for regulation to play a role.

“I usually get excited about these types of things, but I also know from experience that regulation has to be part of the talk,” she said. “Having some sort of nutrient pollution credit, I think, would be an important tool to help that, but it’s not going to solve the issue on its own.”

Sabo said that expanding from a program solely in Louisiana to one encompassing more states in the Mississippi River Basin could be a good way to start making actual, substantial impacts in reducing problems like the dead zone.

“Starting at home makes a lot of sense, because you can’t incentivize market participation between Iowa and Louisiana very easily, but if you have your own market set up, that’s a good pilot for something larger,” said Sabo.

While Mathews didn’t expand on specific plans for future expansion into the Basin, she emphasised the importance of Louisiana trying new and varied ways to tackle the overwhelming problem of nutrient pollution.

“Who knows where we’re gonna go from here? We just have to get one thing done before we can move to anything else,” said Mathews.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0d6d9ff/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1275x669+0+24/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F73%2F0b%2F329834f64252b7bf195243b9873a%2Fdead-zone-research-cruise-noaa.jpg,N,,2025-07-04 14:14:10.152746

In 2024, the United States consumed about 94 quadrillion British thermal units (quads) of energy, a 1% increase from 2023, according to the US Energy Information Administration’s (EIA’s) Monthly Energy Review. Fossil fuels — petroleum, natural gas, and coal — accounted for 82% of total US energy consumption in 2024. Nonfossil fuel energy — from renewables and nuclear energy — accounted for the other 18%. Petroleum remained the most-consumed fuel in the United States, as it has been for the past 75 years, and nuclear energy consumption exceeded coal consumption for the first time ever.

When the Declaration of Independence was signed in 1776, wood was the largest source of energy in the United States. Used for heating, cooking, and lighting, wood remained the largest US energy source until the late 1800s, when coal consumption became more common. Wood energy is still consumed, mainly by industrial lumber and paper plants that burn excess wood waste to generate electricity.

Coal was the largest source of US energy for about 65 years, from 1885 until 1950. Early uses of coal included many purposes that are no longer common, such as in stoves for home heating and in engines for trains and ships. Since the 1960s, nearly all coal consumed in the United States has been for electricity generation.

Petroleum has been the most-consumed source of energy in the United States since 1950. Petroleum products such as motor gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and propane are commonly used across all sectors of the US economy, from transportation to industrial chemicals and plastics.

Natural gas is the second-largest source of US energy consumption, as it has been most years since it surpassed coal in 1958. Natural gas was once considered a waste byproduct of crude oil production but now has become a common energy source for heating and electricity generation.

Early use of water to power grist, lumber, and other milling operations is not well quantified and not included in the EIA’s data, but such mills were common throughout early US history. The first industrial use of hydropower to generate electricity in the United States was to power lamps at a chair factory in Grand Rapids, Michigan, in 1880. The world’s first hydroelectric power plant to sell electricity to the public opened on the Fox River near Appleton, Wisconsin, in 1882.

Other forms of renewable energy did not become significant contributors to US energy production until more recently. In 2016, biofuels — including the fuel ethanol mixed in motor gasoline — became the most-consumed US renewable energy source.

Electricity generation from some zero-carbon sources, such as wind and solar, has increased rapidly in recent years, while generation from others, such as hydropower and nuclear, has remained relatively flat. In 2022, US energy consumption from renewable sources surpassed nuclear energy for the first time since 1984, and in 2023, renewables surpassed coal for the first time since around the early 1880s. The United States now consumes more energy from wind and solar sources individually than from hydropower.

When Slate came out of stealth mode in April, the startup heavily promoted that its all-electric pickup would start at “under $20,000” with the $7,500 federal EV tax credit. That language was still on Slate’s website as recently as yesterday according to the Web Archive.

The change is a potential blow to the young company’s attempt to make a radically affordable electric vehicle.

Slate didn’t provide a precise price for the EV at its launch event; and it has yet to say what the actual starting price of its vehicle will be, sans-credit. A Slate spokesperson declined to comment on the change.

The company won’t start building the truck until the end of 2026 at the earliest. Slate’s business is also built around making this vehicle highly customizable, which means it’s possible that few people will buy the base model to begin with.

The sub-$20,000 price had been a big attraction point for the brand new company’s product, and it was a major focus following its April launch event.

The auto industry has “driven prices to a place that most Americans simply can’t afford,” chief commercial officer Jeremy Snyder said during the event. “But we’re here to change that.”

“We are building the affordable vehicle that has long been promised but never been delivered,” CEO Chris Barman added at the time.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Blank-Slate-Profile_web.jpg?resize=1200,800",N,,2025-07-04 13:21:23.976502

Despite the rapid global improvements in energy efficiency, the impacts of powering data centers for AI are emerging as major challenges.

A large share of US utilities remain underprepared for a low-carbon transition — only 39% score strong on implied temperature rise (ITR) management, with none rated as very strong.

Meeting the electricity needs of AI will increasingly depend on how quickly grid infrastructure, siting processes, and permitting systems can adapt.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing various sectors, driving significant advancements and efficiencies. However, the exponential growth in AI and the resulting data center energy demand poses substantial challenges for the power and utilities sectors. This article explores the implications of AI's rising energy needs and the associated opportunities and challenges in the US power market, with a focus on clean and reliable energy solutions.

Global AI and Data Center Energy Demand Trends

Projections indicate1 that data center energy demand is in a new phase of growth, arising from both the increasing digitalization of the economy and advances in technology, including AI. Computational power required for sustaining AI’s rise is doubling roughly every 100 days and the energy required to run AI tasks is already accelerating, with an annual growth rate between 26-35%.2 Global data demands are projected to nearly triple between 2022 and 2027.3 Despite rapid global improvements in energy efficiency, the impacts of powering data centers are emerging as major challenges.

According to the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) 2024 World Energy Outlook, more than 11,000 data centers are registered for development worldwide — and because data centers are often geographically concentrated, local effects on electricity markets can be substantial.4 While data center electricity demand will grow, it is likely to account for a relatively small share of total global electricity demand growth to 2030.5 Sector growth will be more significant at the national or regional levels in major data center markets, like the US.

Opportunities and Challenges in the US Power Market

The training of large language models, including the generative pretrained transformer (GPT) series, is significantly increasing electricity consumption across US-based AI infrastructure providers.6 Power usage effectiveness (PUE), a metric that measures the energy efficiency of dedicated data centers, has steadily improved across the US data center industry, with operators reporting average PUE rates well below the industry average of a decade ago.7 However, the increasing proportion of total US electricity use driven by AI data centers demonstrates that meeting the needs of AI energy demand can become locally challenging due to operational realities and system-level constraints. See Figure 1 below.

Note: This chart reflects an estimated US grid share of electricity demand from AI-related data center growth. The projection is modeled by Morningstar Sustainalytics using publicly available forecasts from McKinsey & Company and International Energy Agency (IEA, 2024).

In Northern Virginia, currently the world’s largest data center market, grid operators have begun delaying new project approvals due to surging electricity demand from AI infrastructure.10 In regions like Arizona and Texas, hyperscale data centers often rely on water-intensive evaporative cooling systems to improve energy efficiency. But this strategy is drawing concern from stakeholders in these water scarce regions, due to the potential for local water shortages and competition between agriculture and AI — highlighting a growing social awareness of the environmental and social impacts of AI data centers.11 In response, operators are increasingly locating data centers in colder regions, such as the Pacific Northwest and parts of Northern Europe, to reduce reliance on mechanical cooling. Lower ambient temperatures allow for free cooling, reducing both electricity use and operating costs. This approach supports long-term sustainability and may ease permitting in water-constrained areas.12

Among the challenges associated with placements of data centers in the US, the pace of energy market growth and availability could also be restricted by supply chain bottlenecks, particularly for the chips that handle AI and other compute-intensive workloads.13 Federal incentives under the CHIPS Act14 are accelerating domestic semiconductor manufacturing in the US, adding to electricity demand across production hubs. However, on the operational side, advancements in chip architecture are improving computational efficiency, with newer AI chips delivering significantly more performance per watt than previous generations.15

While data centers have improved internal efficiency, overall electricity consumption continues to rise due to the rapid scaling of AI workloads.16 AI electricity demand is projected to grow more than eight times, while total grid demand rises only approximately 10%. See Figure 2.

Note: Indexed trajectories reflect projected growth in AI-related electricity demand and total US grid demand, normalized to 2023 levels (Index = 100). Figures are based on publicly available projections from McKinsey & Company (2024) and the International Energy Agency (IEA, 2024) and are intended to illustrate the scale and pace of potential demand divergence.

Data center-driven growth is fundamentally reshaping power demand profiles. If the transmission and generation build out lags in certain geographies, this could lead to capacity bottlenecks, increased congestion costs, and slower infrastructure approvals – which reinforces the need to strategically build grid capacity in regions experiencing rapid data center growth. It also highlights the role of selecting cool-climate sites for data centers. These sites offer chip-level energy efficiency gains for helping manage electricity demand while maintaining operational resilience.

Addressing Energy Supply and Reliability Gaps

According to Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection (PJM) analysis — the regional transmission organization that coordinates the movement of wholesale electricity in all or parts of 13 states and the District of Columbia in the US — the expected retirements of thermal plants in the US could lead to an energy supply shortfall of approximately 40GW by 2030.17 The combination of policy-driven thermal plant retirements and rising AI-related electricity demand is elevating the importance of dispatchable capacity to maintain grid stability.

Dispatchable resources, such as natural gas and hydropower, remain critical for grid reliability. Their supply can quickly ramp up and be dispatched to meet electricity demand when wind or solar generation drops, especially during peak hours or prolonged weather-related shortfalls. However, even as data center operators improve internal efficiency through reduced PUE and chip-level energy optimization, the scale and intensity of AI workloads are pushing electricity demand beyond what current dispatchable infrastructure was designed to support.

The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) publishes real-time regional electricity generation rates by energy source.18 Looking at the data for Texas in Figure 3, gaps in the reliability of wind and solar energy are obvious as the generation sources come online strongly to then abruptly decline and be replaced by dispatchable natural gas. Battery and energy storage can also be seen filling smaller voids. Natural gas generation is filling the reliability gap, even in markets with high renewables penetration like the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT).

Figure 3. Texas Region Electricity Generation by Energy Source. April 3 – 10, 2025

As grid congestion and permitting delays increase in regions like Northern Virginia,19 operators may begin targeting underbuilt areas with available transmission capacity and access to lower-carbon or dispatchable energy sources to meet long-term reliability and sustainability goals. The types of energy assets being dispatched, and the frequency and duration of their supply to the grid, can have an impact on greenhouse gas emissions and, therefore, net zero targets and ambitions.

Carbon Intensity of US Power Generation

Electricity-related CO2 emissions vary based on the fuel sources of electricity and the carbon intensity of power generation varies widely across US states due to differences in fuel sources used.20 From 2016 to 2020, the carbon intensity of US power generation fell 18%, driven by a shift away from coal and toward natural gas and renewables.21 However, as AI-related electricity demand expands, data centers are increasingly choosing sites in regions where power is abundant and cost competitive. In many cases, these conditions are found in grids that remain heavily reliant on fossil fuels. This dynamic contrasts with Canada’s strategy, where provinces like Quebec benefit from hydroelectric baseload and apply stricter permitting, resulting in cleaner power mixes. Data center site decisions in the US could therefore undermine decarbonization goals, unless carbon intensity is factored in.

We analyzed the carbon intensity of generation among US utilities covered in the Morningstar Sustainalytics ESG Risk Ratings universe. This indicator assesses a company's performance with regard to carbon intensity (related to power generation) by calculating the carbon emissions of a company’s own power generation portfolio (i.e., facilities within its operational control) in a given fiscal year. Our findings show that approximately 40% of the US utilities evaluated are rated as having high or very high carbon intensity of generation (see Figure 4). This suggests that a significant share of the US power sector continues to rely on carbon-intensive generation assets, posing both transition and regulatory risks.

Note: Data is for 32 publicly listed US headquartered utility companies’ most recent Sustainalytics ESG Risk Rating assessments as of April 17, 2025.

We then compared the carbon intensity of generation for these US utilities against their Canadian peers and observed a different pattern of distribution. About 40% of US utilities fall into the high or very high carbon intensity categories, whereas Canadian utilities are more concentrated in the middle, with approximately three-quarters rated as either high or moderate. Notably, Canadian utilities show no representation in the very high or very low categories, indicating fewer extreme outliers on either end of the emissions spectrum. This highlights a narrower range of carbon intensity outcomes among Canadian utilities, which may be influenced by differences in energy resource availability or generation planning priorities. See Figure 5.

Utility Transition Readiness – Beyond Carbon Intensity

While carbon intensity provides a snapshot of how emissions-intensive a power utility is today, it doesn’t capture whether that supplier is structurally equipped to decarbonize in line with net zero trajectories. That forward-looking lens is provided by Morningstar Sustainalytics’ Low Carbon Transition Ratings (LCTR) — a framework designed to assess issuer-level alignment with a 1.5 degrees Celsius scenario.

Within LCTR, the implied temperature rise (ITR) management score evaluates a company’s preparedness based on governance, decarbonization strategy, capital allocation, and implementation progress. It moves beyond policy commitments to assess whether a company has the internal capabilities and roadmap to transition meaningfully.",https://www.sustainalytics.com/images/default-source/blog-images/i-s-energy-demand-meets-us-utility-readiness.jpg?sfvrsn=27c47f80_1,N,,2025-07-04 22:06:41.633448

SB 66 (ACT 295): RELATING TO HOUSING

Vetoes:

Governor Green issued the following eight vetoes today:

HB 235: RELATING TO TRAFFIC SAFETY

Veto rational: The Department of Transportation has developed specific criteria for the selection of communities within which to implement traffic safety systems. This criteria incorporates data-driven crash, citation and traffic volume metrics, which ensure communities are chosen based on need and potential for greatest impact. Ignoring this criteria in favor of legislatively mandated location selection threatens the integrity of the photo red light imaging detector system and automated speed enforcement system programs.

HB 796: RELATING TO TAX CREDITS

Veto rational: This bill would have a significant long-term impact on income tax credits across a variety of industries, including film and television, research, and renewable energy. These tax credits are critical to supporting economic development and diversification, particularly within growing and emerging sectors. Categorically sunsetting income tax credits will not only disincentivize future investors from doing business in Hawai‘i, but will destabilize existing businesses that currently rely upon these tax credits.

HB 958: RELATING TO TRANSPORTATION

Veto rational: While mopeds and motorcycles are exempt from the prohibition established within this bill, on “high-speed electric devices” driving on public roadways, electric cars are not exempt in the definition. Such a prohibition would likely violate the Commerce Clause and Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution and conflict with the administration’s commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

HB 1296: RELATING TO THE MAJOR DISASTER FUND

Veto rational: The administration is committed to the transparent, efficient management of state funds. During times of emergency, flexibility and the quick release of funds is necessary to respond to rapidly changing situations. This bill disrupts the delicate balance between reporting requirements facilitating government transparency and fiscal flexibility for efficient emergency response and recovery efforts. Placing additional administrative oversight over funds expended for emergencies jeopardizes public safety.

HB 1369: RELATING TO TAXATION

Veto rational: The amendments to the general excise tax and use tax contained in this bill would impact sugarcane producers, commercial fishing vessels and securities exchanges. Removing the specific tax exemptions afforded to these entities would provide little financial benefit to the state while harming, in particular, sugarcane producers.

SB 31: RELATING TO PROPERTY

Veto rational: By enabling any person, including those without any interest in the specified real property, to record a statement that a real property’s title includes a discriminatory restrictive covenant, this bill provides a statutorily authorized mechanism for the circulation of disinformation. This disinformation has the potential to negatively affect the marketability of a property.

The week that was

The US spent much of this week wrangling over the Trump administration’s budget reconciliation bill, with it passing both the House and the Senate before the end of Thursday.

The “big, beautiful bill” will be ready for President Trump to sign on Friday afternoon, bang on his self-imposed deadline of July 4. It will slash clean energy subsidies, raise energy costs, and be highly inflationary, analysts say. They also claim it will be a gift to China by removing the US from the clean energy superpower race.

Notwithstanding the expected dent in investment, the bill is also likely to make one of President Trump’s stated aims — “unleashing American energy” and cutting household bills — considerably more difficult. Estimates say American households will be paying $50bn more in energy costs by 2035 as a result.

Meanwhile, this week the UK’s Labour government marked one year in office. The anniversary was not a joyous one, with headlines dominated by welfare reforms and a tearful Prime Minister’s Questions.

But James Alexander, chief executive of the UK Sustainable Investment and Finance Association, strikes a more positive note. He says the government’s integration of “decarbonisation within its growth agenda” during the course of this year has “laid a strong foundation” and welcomes support for climate transition plans and the clean energy sector.

“However, to prove its credibility to global investors, the government must now show it can turn this ambition into rapid, effective delivery,” he adds.

Person in the news

The European Commission announced its plans to reduce emissions by 90 per cent by 2040, with the controversial inclusion of carbon credits.

The proposal, which involves an amendment to EU law, would allow the bloc to offset a portion of its emissions through “high quality” carbon credits from 2036.

Many in Europe argue that the commission’s climate targets are unaffordable and should be toned-down in the face of rising populism. But one voice that remains fully committed is Teresa Ribera, the executive vice-president for a clean, just and competitive transition, who is tasked with keeping a fracturing Europe on track to meet its climate goals.

The plan was announced as Europe sweltered under a heatwave, with temperatures reaching 46C in Ribera’s native Spain. “Our climate policies . . . are pivotal to achieving other social and economic policy goals, such as security and prosperity of our people and companies,” said Ribera in a press statement.

Similarly, a survey published by the commission this week shows that 85 per cent of Europeans say climate change is a serious problem.

Europe

The EU and the Organisation of African Caribbean and Pacific States have issued a joint statement reaffirming their commitment to the UN 2030 Agenda and its sustainable development goals and calling for an “ambitious global financing framework” to accelerate progress. The agreement was signed at the fourth UN Conference on Financing for Development, which was held in Seville, Spain, this week. Speaking at the conference, president of the European Council, António Costa, said that an additional $4tn a year is needed to meet the 2030 goals.

Also at the conference in Seville, the European Investment Bank and the commission announced a guarantee agreement to provide up to €5bn to de-risk investments and expand EIB operations outside the EU. The agreement could unlock up to €10bn in funding for clean energy, green infrastructure and access to finance for small and medium enterprises in north Africa and the Middle East, the commission says.

The commission and the EIB have also announced that €3.66bn has been disbursed from the Modernisation Fund to support 34 energy-related projects in nine EU member states. The investments focus on the generation and deployment of renewable energy and are mostly in eastern European countries. The funding comes from revenues from the EU emissions trading system.

The European Council has extended economic restrictions on the Russian economy until the end of January 2026, due it its continued war in Ukraine. The restrictions cover trade, finance, energy including seaborne crude oil and certain petroleum products, technology, industry, transport and luxury goods.

The commission has launched a €10bn backed strategy to make Europe a global leader in life sciences — defined as the study of animal and plant ecosystems — by 2030. The commission says life sciences are central to our “health, environment and economy”. The strategy focuses on optimising research and innovation, enabling better market access for start-ups through an EU biotech act and mobilising private sector investment.

The commission has also selected 94 transport projects to receive nearly €2.8bn in EU grants under the Connecting Europe Facility. Rail networks will receive the largest share of the funding (77 per cent).

Ahead of the finalisation of the Circular Economy Act, expected in 2026, the commission has announced new circular economy initiatives. These include the implementation of a digital waste shipment system, an evaluation of electronic waste legislation and rules to improve recycling efficiency, and upcoming rules on material recovery from waste batteries. A public consultation and a call for evidence on the new initiatives will be launched soon.

In the first test of the EU’s anti-Slapp directive, Greenpeace International has challenged US oil pipeline company Energy Transfer in a Dutch court. The company won a landmark case against Greenpeace USA in March when a North Dakota jury found the charity liable for defamation and business interference over protests surrounding the Dakota Access Pipeline. That case, which Greenpeace USA has appealed, was widely viewed as a strategic lawsuit against public participation.

The six Western Balkans partners (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia) have announced an investment package of €87.7mn for eight new investments in clean energy in Albania, Montenegro and Serbia, as proposed by the commission. The projects will include the construction of overhead lines and substations, hydropower and solar heating.

The European Financial Reporting Advisory Group has extended the public consultation period on the revision and simplification of the European Sustainability Reporting Standards. The consultation was originally planned to run for 30-45 days, starting at the end of July, but will now run for 60 days from the end of July until the end of September 2025.

Europe’s forests and lands are not absorbing as much carbon as previously projected, putting the bloc’s carbon reduction targets focused on sequestration at risk, according to research published by the European Environment Agency. A reduction in net carbon removal is driven by maturing forests, which sequester carbon at a lower rate, and increased tree felling and climate-driven natural disturbances, including forest fires, droughts and pests, the report says.

UK

The UK government has published a solar road map outlining a plan to mobilise sufficient solar capacity to meet the government’s clean power by 2030 target. The road map lists actions to be taken by government and industry across deployment, skills, supply chain and planning, during the next five years.

The government has also launched a similar plan for the onshore wind sector. The strategy outlines 40 actions to unlock 27-29GW of onshore wind by 2030.

The government has also announced that it will issue healthy food standards for supermarkets under its 10 Year Health Plan, launched on July 3. The standards will require retailers to make the average shopping basket of goods slightly healthier through reformulating products, changing shop layouts, offering discounts on healthy foods or changing loyalty schemes to promote healthier options. Supermarkets will be able to choose what measures they take to meet the standard. The standard will also introduce mandatory reporting on the share of healthy food sold by retailers.

Meanwhile, research published this week by UK circularity non-profit Wrap calls on the government to implement policies to reduce the amount of food wasted in the UK. Globally, food waste accounts for between 8 to 10 per cent of greenhouse gases, and the UK has included food waste emissions in its Nationally Determined Contribution under the COP framework, Wrap says. In 2022, UK households wasted 6mn tonnes of food, 4.4mn tonnes of which were edible. The government and retailers must take action such as changing labels from “use by” to “best before” and banning packaging on certain fruit and vegetables so consumers can select just as much as they need, the non-profit adds.

The UK’s energy regulator, Ofgem, has green lit a £24bn investment programme for UK electricity grids. More than £15bn will be allocated to gas transmission and distribution networks, £8.9bn to high-voltage electricity networks and a further £1.3bn to expand the electricity grid. The draft settlement is the first step in a £80bn investment programme into UK electricity network capacity.

The UK’s AI Energy Council, which includes energy providers, tech companies, energy regulator Ofgem and the National Energy System Operator, met on Monday to discuss the growing energy demands of the artificial intelligence sector. The council is developing a forecast of how much energy will be needed to deliver the government’s target for a 20-fold increase in UK compute capacity during the next five years.

UK water companies must increase compensation to consumers for issues such as continued low water pressure, flooding and cancelled appointments. The change brings compensation payments in line with inflation, says the government’s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The government is also exploring expanding the list of circumstances that trigger compensation payments.

Defra has also announced a doubling in funding for the UK’s Environment Agency to increase farm inspections to check they are complying with environmental law. The funding increase will allow the EA to offer more guidance to farmers, strengthen links with supply chains, make better use of technology like remote sensing, and take stronger action against serious or ongoing pollution, the government says.

US

US President Donald Trump has proposed withdrawing funding from the Montreal Protocol, the 1987 agreement to save the ozone layer, which is widely viewed as one of the most successful treaties of all time. If the US were to withdraw from the agreement, it could become harder for US manufacturers to sell their goods in other markets. This is because in signing the protocol, countries agreed to eliminate the production and use of chemicals that were commonly used in refrigerators, aerosols and air conditioners. Scientists say the Montreal Protocol will prevent 2.5C of additional warming by 2100.

In a victory for investors, a Washington DC appeals court has upheld a prior decision that proxy advisers’ advice does not amount to solicitation. Companies have sought to defang proxy advisers for years, arguing they improperly shape investor votes, and in 2020 the securities regulator introduced additional disclosures for such companies. Proxy adviser ISS sued the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the DC court of appeals ruled on July 3 with the plaintiff that the regulator had acted improperly with the introduction of those rules.

California governor Gavin Newsom has exempted a range of projects from the state’s 54-year-old Environmental Quality Act in a bid to resolve the housing crisis. Newsom said the exemptions were necessary to ensure more homes were built quickly, but critics have likened the move to President Trump’s rollback of the National Environmental Policy Act. Semiconductor and electric vehicle plants would be exempt from review, along with water system upgrades, high-speed rail and wildfire fuel breaks.

The Supreme Court has ordered ExxonMobil to pay $14.25mn over allegations of unlawful emissions at its Baytown, Texas complex. In a case spanning 15 years, Sierra Club and Environmental Texas Citizen Lobby claimed the company’s emissions of harmful air pollutants routinely exceeded Clean Air Act limits, affecting local citizens. ExxonMobil had appealed a 2021 ruling, which the Supreme Court denied. The $14.25mn figure is the biggest penalty in a citizen-initiated lawsuit under the Clean Air Act.

Americas

In an advisory opinion, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights has ruled that governments must take “urgent and effective actions” to safeguard the right to a healthy climate, as well as the right to nature and ecosystems. It said all businesses have a responsibility not to harm human rights, but singled out fossil fuels, cement manufacturing and the agriculture industry as those that have a responsibility “due to the risk created by their activities”. Greenpeace Mexico campaigner Pablo Ramírez says this is a “life-changing decision . . . providing us with a pathway to climate justice, obliging states to guarantee human rights, address climate impacts and force polluting industries to repair the damage they have caused”.

States should be able to continue existing politically even if sea level rises mean their land disappears underwater, according to a report by the International Law Commission. Average sea levels could rise by 90cm by 2100 if scientists’ worst-case projections materialise, which is a major issue for small island developing states.",https://d2iztrg3kgqpue.cloudfront.net/production/41e0bad3-c67c-48ad-a9cf-2f51b31bd0dc.jpg,N,,2025-07-04 14:12:47.677788

This marks the pivot in clean energy policy that most were expecting from the new Administration. Mainly affecting Production Tax Credits (PTC), Investment Tax Credits (ITC) and consumer tax credits, what are the key takeaways from the Bill for the US EV, battery, and critical minerals industry?

The EV market loses key subsidies

As of September 30th 2025, both the $7,500 30D clean vehicle credits and the $4,000 25E used-EV credits will be terminated. Additionally, the 45W commercial vehicle clean vehicle tax credit will also be eliminated.

Over the last three years, these credits have been a key driver of US EV sales. So far in 2025, approximately 50% of EVs sold in the US have been eligible for the 30D tax credit, according to Rho Motion’s EV & Battery Forecast.

The 45W tax credit, originally designed to support commercial clean vehicles, such as electric trucks, has in practice been widely used for leased passenger cars. When an automaker’s leasing arm buys the vehicle, it is classified as a commercial purchase, making it eligible for 45W. This credit comes with far fewer restrictions than 30D, meaning any EV is eligible. The result has been that popularity for leasing EVs has soared from around 10% of sales in 2022, to roughly two thirds of EVs sold in recent months. The removal of all these credits will have a considerable impact on the market.

Considering EV demand, sentiment in the US has shifted since Trump took office. Taking into consideration the new administration’s announcements regarding changes to emission policies, and assuming tax credits would remain in place for most of 2025, Rho Motion had already reduced its US EV sales outlook by 42% – compared to forecasts from 2024 to 2025- across the period 2025-30, prior to passage of the “Big Beautiful Bill.

Under the Bill, the 45X credit will remain in place but with a definitive end date; a phase down will begin in 2030 with it ending fully in 2033. This applies to all recipients, from battery manufacturers to critical mineral players.

The 45X PTC has been key to increasing domestic battery players competitiveness to imports from foreign manufacturers, as it offers a tax credit for each eligible unit of material or component produced in the US. Previously, the credit could be stacked across the whole supply chain, allowing some players to receive $45/kWh in tax credits for battery cells & modules. The final act allows stacking but only if:

(i) The second eligible manufactured component (secondary component) is produced in the same facility as the first eligible manufactured component (primary component).

(ii) At least 65% of the total direct material costs for the secondary component are attributable to primary components which are mined, produced, or manufactured in the US?

BESS retains access to 48E ITC and 45Y PTC but solar and wind sectors see change

Previously, Iola Hughes, Head of Research at Rho Motion had discussed with industry leaders how devastating the removal of the 48 ITC would be for the US storage industry at Benchmark’s Giga USA in June. However, for BESS these credits will remain in place in full, meaning players can still receive the 6% base rate and 30% bonus rate as well as other additional stackable awards for new projects.

Additionally, the 45Y tax credit remains in place for BESS, which allows electricity producers to claim credits for each kWh of electricity generated. Both these credits will remain available in full through to 2033, with a phase down ending by 2036 – although they will face stricter foreign entity rules.

However, for wind and solar, qualifications for the credits are limited. To qualify, projects must be placed in service by December 31, 2027, or have started construction within one year of the Bill’s enactment and be placed in service within four years to remain eligible for 48E/45Y. This is expected to drastically reduce wind and solar installations in the US. Considering just under 50% of US BESS projects in Rho Motion’s 2025 to 2028 BESS pipeline are paired with either solar or wind, a reduction in wind and solar will also lead to a reduction in BESS installations.

“Foreign Entity of Concern Rules” apply to 48E, 45Y and 45X

For 45X:- No credit is allowed for components that include material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity in taxable years beginning after the enactment of the Bill.

No credit is allowed in taxable years beginning after the date of enactment of the Bill if the taxpayer is a prohibited foreign entity.

For 48E and 45Y: No credit is allowed for a facility that starts construction after December 31, 2025, if the taxpayer receives material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity.

No credit is allowed in taxable years beginning after the date of enactment of the Bill if the taxpayer is a prohibited foreign entity.

The next steps for the Bill

The Bill now goes to President Trump to be signed and formally passed in law. Following this further interpretation guidance will be issued by the Treasury department. This guidance will make clear how the state interprets prohibited entity restrictions and component sourcing.

A Critical Insight for Benchmark forecast subscribers will be released in the coming week as interpretation on the published text becomes clearer, and potential impacts on forecasts are re-modelled.","https://res.cloudinary.com/dkklqdsqc/images/f_auto,q_auto/v1705961760/wp_production/Safeimagekit-resized-img/Safeimagekit-resized-img.png?_i=AA",N,,2025-07-04 16:09:56.027378

An essential guide to the week’s key developments relating to climate change.

This week

Congress passes Trump’s ‘megabill’

TAX CREDITS CRUSHED: A major budget bill passed by US congress this week is “poised to remake American energy by slashing tax breaks for wind and solar power and electric cars”, reported the New York Times. The legislation, which was “muscled” through by Republicans, “provides a boost to fossil fuels and dismantles many of the biggest actions the federal government has ever taken to fight climate change”, the newspaper said.

‘CRACKDOWN’: The version of the bill approved by the Senate on Tuesday included “compromise language” that gave wind and solar projects one year to begin construction to claim current tax credits, noted Politico. “Hard-line” Republicans in the House of Representatives told the outlet that they backed the bill only after receiving assurances from Donald Trump that he would use executive action to further “constrict” wind and solar.

LAB LIABILITY: The bill, which is expected to be signed by Trump today, also “seeks to defund” multiple climate labs, according to CNN. This includes the Mauno Lao laboratory in Hawaii, where measurements since 1958 have produced the iconic “Keeling Curve” of rising atmospheric CO2, the outlet noted. See below for more on the emissions impact of Trump’s bill.

Record-breaking heatwave ‘grips’ Europe

RED ALERTS: At least eight people died across Europe as a heatwave gripped much of the continent, reported Reuters, “triggering health alerts and forest fires and forcing the closure of a nuclear reactor at a Swiss power plant”. The New York Times quoted UN secretary general António Guterres, who said: “Extreme heat is no longer a rare event – it has become the new normal.”

RECORD-BREAKING: Both Spain and England had their hottest June on record, noted BBC News, with the Spanish weather service saying the average of 23.6C “pulverised records”. The outlet added that France registered its second-hottest June, while the Guardian reported that Portugal hit a provisional record high for June of 46.6C.

FLASH FLOODS: Elsewhere, a record downpour in the central Chinese province of Hubei brought a month’s worth of rain in just 12 hours to the city of Xianfeng, reported Reuters. Authorities moved 18,000 people to safety, the newswire said. Flooding in India’s northern state of Himachal Pradesh left five people dead, reported the Hindustan Times.

Around the world

‘WATER[ED] DOWN’: The European Commission’s newly proposed target to cut the EU’s carbon emissions by 90% by 2040 has been criticised for allowing up to 3% of the goal to be met with international carbon credits, reported Carbon Brief.

BRAZIL OIL BID: Brazil’s COP30 president-designate, André Corrêa do Lago, has “played down concerns” on Brazil’s oil expansion after a new analysis found the nation will drive a surge in new production by 2030, reported the Financial Times.

‘REPUTATIONAL RISK’: The nomination of an economist from the Saudi Aramco oil company as a coordinating lead author for an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report has been denounced as “political capture”, reported Politico.

FLIGHT FEE: A group of countries, including France, Kenya and Barbados, have pledged to tax private jets and premium-class flying in a bid to raise funds for climate action at a summit in Spain, Reuters reported. Climate Home News has all the key climate-finance takeaways from the event.

‘MAJOR SETBACK’: A £65m satellite launched last year to detect methane emissions from oil and gas production has been “lost in space”, reported BBC News.

£528m

The amount by which “climate aid” given by the UK government to developing countries was inflated through controversial changes to the way climate finance is now being designated, Carbon Brief analysis showed.

Latest climate research

Sustained cuts to US military spending could result in annual energy savings by 2032 equivalent to the energy consumption of Slovenia, a study in PLOS Climate found.

Using satellite data, a study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences revealed a marked increase in surface salinity across the Southern Ocean since 2015, coinciding with a “dramatic decline” in Antarctic sea ice.

Research in Nature Cities highlighted the “disproportionate flood exposure” faced by urban slum populations in the global south, with one in three living on a floodplain.

(For more, see Carbon Brief’s in-depth daily summaries of the top climate news stories on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.)

Captured

Trump’s dismantling of climate policy means the US will add an extra 7bn tonnes of emissions to the atmosphere from now until 2030, compared to meeting its former climate pledge under the Paris Agreement, according to new Carbon Brief analysis of modelling from Princeton University. The approval of Trump’s megabill repealing clean-energy tax credits, alongside a series of executive orders, means that US emissions are now set to drop to just 3% below current levels by 2030 – effectively flatlining – rather than falling 40% as required to hit the now-defunct target, according to the analysis.

Tipping points that worry scientists the most

This week, delegates at the Global Tipping Points 2025 conference in Exeter tell Carbon Brief which potential tipping “element” in the Earth system they are most worried about.

Prof Tim Lenton, founding director of the Global Systems Institute and chair in climate change and Earth system science at the University of Exeter:

“The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, or AMOC, for sure. The consequences of crashing that would be devastating globally – and also for where I live in the UK. By our own calculation, we could have less than half the viable area for growing a couple of major staple crops, wheat and maize, worldwide. We would have a widespread water crisis. We could have collapses of the monsoons in West Africa and India that would displace hundreds of millions of people. It is hard to see that in anything other than a catastrophe.”

Prof Ricarda Winkelmann, founding director of the Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology and professor of climate system analysis at the University of Potsdam:

“So I am thinking about this from a risk perspective – so both the likelihood as well as the impacts – and I think the answer depends on that. Because when it comes to the likelihood and the particular threshold – and we know about those – I’m mostly concerned about the Greenland and the West Antarctic ice sheets. This is because we know that, even at lower warming levels, they’re already at risk of transgressing tipping points in certain regions.

“But when it comes to the impacts and also the timescales over which those play out, there are other tipping elements that worry me most. In particular, regional tipping elements. So, if we think of the mountain glaciers, for instance, these impacts are already experienced right now and several mountain glaciers are undergoing these accelerated changes.”

Prof Gabi Hegerl, chair in climate system science in the school of geosciences at the University of Edinburgh:

“I am worried about all of them. But, for the immediate future, I am particularly worried about tipping points that involve the biosphere and humans due to breaching thresholds for heat or drought that then ripple into food availability, livelihood and ecosystems. The Earth system tipping points will do that, too, but maybe a little bit later. Examples are coral diebacks triggered by marine heatwaves, forest change and fires, and droughts threatening livelihoods and putting people on the move.

“I did a research project on the US dustbowl and the trigger was drought causing vegetation and crop dieback, then [leading to] extreme heat and dust storms in response – and migration, as memorialised in [the 1939 John Steinbeck novel] The Grapes of Wrath. And, now with warming, all droughts get supercharged.”

Prof Carlos Nobre, Brazilian scientist and meteorologist who spearheaded the multi-disciplinary, multinational large-scale biosphere-atmosphere experiment in the Amazon:

“The Amazon is a very serious tipping point, because [dieback] could release around 250bn tonnes of CO2 by 2100 – which will make it impossible to [limit global warming] at 1.5C. We could also lose the largest [host to] biodiversity on the planet, which would induce a tremendous, large number of epidemics and several pandemics. Also, of course, the Amazon forest controls aspects of the global climate. In South America, the climate is entirely controlled by the Amazon forest.”

Carbon Brief will publish further coverage of the Global Tipping Points conference next week.

Inside Climate News says the $4tn bill will “slic[e] into every aspect of the national effort to address climate change and environmental injustice”.
Quartz cites experts who say that the bill will “absolutely” raise energy and electricity costs across the country.
Meteorologists say that Europe should expect more and hotter heatwaves as a result of climate change”.
The state-supporting newspaper Global Times reports Europe is driving “surging demand” for Chinese cooling products, such as air conditioners, following “heatwaves” on the continent.","The Republican-controlled US Congress has passed a major budget bill that cuts important policies for supporting wind and solar power, according to the Verge. It explains that the bill “moves funds away from Medicaid, clean-energy tax credits and other public services and toward Trump’s attempt to mass-deport both documented and undocumented immigrants”.

The House of Representatives passed the bill by a vote of 218 to 214, after it was approved in the Senate on Tuesday by one vote, according to Canary Media. It adds that Trump is expected to sign the bill during a ceremony later today, which is Independence Day in the US. The legislation “effectively repeals or dilutes much of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act” – former president Joe Biden’s landmark climate legislation – and is set to have a “devastating effect on the development of clean energy, increasing utility costs and worsening climate change as a result”, the article says. The bill also extends tax cuts implemented in Trump’s first term while cutting “more than $1tn in federal spending on safety-net programs and clean-energy credits”, Bloomberg says. As well as cutting tax breaks for wind and solar power and electric cars, the bill maintains some federal support for power sources such as nuclear reactors and geothermal plants, the New York Times explains. It adds that the bill “provides a boost to fossil fuels and dismantles many of the biggest actions the federal government has ever taken to fight climate change”. The bill “gives the oil industry everything it wants”, including opening up federal lands to drilling and making it cheaper to operate there, according to CNBC. Electric-vehicle tax credits of up to $7,500, previously scheduled to last through to 2032, are now set to be removed at the end of September, CNN says. Inside Climate News says the $4tn bill will “slic[e] into every aspect of the national effort to address climate change and environmental injustice”. Early modelling by research groups shows the bill, as passed by the Senate earlier in the week, would lift US carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 8-12% from levels expected over the next decade under the Inflation Reduction Act, Politico reports.

The final version of the bill is “largely what emerged” from the Senate finance committee last month, “though the current version offers slightly longer timelines to claim clean-energy tax credits”, TechCrunch explains. The hard-right House “freedom caucus” of Republicans had criticised the most recent version and “wanted to see more significant cuts”, Utility Dive notes. The version of the bill that was approved by the Senate earlier in the week had included “compromise language” on the phaseout of solar and wind tax breaks, including giving projects “one year to begin construction to claim current tax credits”, Politico says. This came up against right-wing Republican “hard-liners” in the House, who say they ultimately approved the bill because they received assurances from the Trump administration that the president would use “executive action” to further “constrict” wind and solar projects, according to the news outlet.

Quartz cites experts who say that the bill will “absolutely” raise energy and electricity costs across the country. It cites analysis from climate policy thinktank Energy Innovation, which concludes that the version of the bill that passed the Senate would see wholesale electricity prices increase by 25% by 2030 and 74% by 2035. Canary Media has a map, based on separate analysis, showing how the bill would increase electricity prices in every state. The Associated Press says the bill is set to increase average annual electricity costs “by more than $100 per household by next year”. Inside Climate News has an article quoting industry representatives and energy experts who say that the bill will “stunt” the growth of clean power in Republican-controlled Texas. A piece in Bloomberg is headlined: “What killing tax credits means for the electric vehicle market.” Given Trump’s focus on “beautiful” coal and “ugly” wind power, the Washington Post has an article comparing the aesthetic value of different energy sources.

Meanwhile, the US Environmental Protection Agency has put on administrative leave 139 employees who signed a “declaration of dissent” against its policies, the Associated Press reports. This follows a “weakening of funding and federal support for climate, environmental and health science”, the article notes. A Guardian investigation concludes that a “generation of scientific talent is at the brink of being lost to overseas competitors” due to the Trump administration’s dismantling of the National Science Foundation (NSF). It explains that climate research is one of the particularly vulnerable areas. E&E News has an article about changes in federal guidelines on science protocol that it says “could amplify climate sceptics”. Finally, the Washington Post has an article about Trump signing an executive order this week seeking to “make America beautiful again”, by “establishing a council tasked with conserving public lands, protecting wildlife populations and ensuring clean drinking water while remaining silent on climate change”. It notes that the move is a “first nod at outlining a cohesive environmental policy” for the Trump administration.

Coverage of the extreme heat across Europe continues in many news outlets. The Financial Times says the “scorching heatwave across parts of Europe this week has been linked to half a dozen deaths, fuelled wildfires in Greece and Turkey and piled pressure on the continent’s already stressed waterways”. Temperatures have been higher than 40C in some areas this week, and reached as high as 46C in Spain and Portugal, it adds. The New York Times says European temperatures are “well above seasonal norms”, adding that “as the planet continues to warm, what was once rare has become frequent. Meteorologists say that Europe should expect more and hotter heatwaves as a result of climate change”. Bloomberg says: “Summers in Europe, where climate change has seen the region warm twice as fast as the global average since the 1980s, are increasingly blighted by intense and frequent heatwaves.”

A wildfire on the Greek island of Crete has driven the evacuation of more than 1,500 people amid the early summer heat, according to Al Jazeera. It notes that last year, Greece saw its warmest summer ever, as well as 45,000 hectares “torched by wildfires”. In eastern Germany “at least two firefighters have been seriously injured and more than 100 residents evacuated as wildfires continue to burn”, according to Euronews. It attributes wildfires across the continent to the blast of extreme heat. The western Balkans are facing “extreme drought” amid the soaring temperatures, according to the Associated Press. The New York Times reports on how the record-breaking heat has forced nuclear power plant operators in France and Switzerland to shut down at least three reactors at two sites.

Meanwhile, Euractiv reports that Denmark, which has taken over the presidency of the Council of the European Union, has said reaching a deal on new EU climate targets ahead of COP30 will be “difficult”. Le Monde reports that France’s official climate advisors have warned that the pace of the nation’s decarbonisation “slowed considerably” in 2024. Politico has a profile of Teresa Ribera – the “European Commission’s second-most powerful politician” – and her role in leading on climate action in the EU.

Brazil’s COP30 summit chief, André Corrêa do Lago, has “defended oil and gas production as being compatible with international efforts to limit global warming” following new analysis showing his nation’s plans for oil expansion, the Financial Times reports. The analysis by campaign group Global Witness, based on data from independent consultancy Rystad Energy, shows that state-backed Petrobras is set to increase oil production “by among the most of the world’s top producers in percentage terms”, the newspaper explains.

In other news, a non-binding advisory opinion from the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACHR) concluded that its member states “must cooperate to tackle climate change and not take actions that set back environmental protections”, Reuters reports. The newswire explains that the court holds jurisdiction over 20 Latin American and Caribbean countries and the advisory opinion was requested by Colombia and Chile. The court also concluded that companies must adopt “effective” measures to tackle climate change, states should discourage “greenwashing” and states should set targets to cut emissions that “are as ambitious as possible”, with concrete timeframes, the article continues.

In other news, “for the first time in history” Catholic bishops representing more than 800 million people across the global south have issued a joint statement demanding an “ambitious implementation” of the Paris Agreement, according to Mongabay. Ten years on from Pope Francis’ “Laudato Si” encyclical, which promoted climate action, the bishops call on states to “implement ambitious nationally determined contributions on a scale commensurate with the climate emergency”, the article adds. Meanwhile, the New York Times reports that the Vatican, led by the new Pope Leo XIV, has released a new rite for mass that can “be used to ask God for the ability to care for creation”.

“Flow batteries” are emerging as a potential solution for energy storage in China, business news outlet Caixin reports, with “China’s installation of flow batteries surg[ing] 570% year-on-year to 1.8 gigawatt-hours” in 2024. Flow batteries are larger and heavier than lithium-ion batteries, but have advantages in terms of “long-term costs”, duration and safety, the outlet adds. Science and Technology Daily publishes an article saying that utilisation rates of wind and solar power in China’s western regions fell between January and May this year, due to a “rapid growth” in renewable energy installations. State news agency Xinhua reports that China has released a “series of national standards” covering areas including the “green transformation of traditional industries”; the development of transportation and energy; and “green and low-carbon development”. China Reform Daily, an outlet managed by top economic-planning body the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), quotes an NDRC official saying China “needs to maintain medium- and long-term [coal-power] contracts as a core [mechanism] to ensure stable coal supply”. State-run newspaper China Daily reports that the carbon intensity of China’s textile sector fell by more than 60% from 2005 to 2022 as producers use technologies to “accelerate the sector’s green transformation”.

Meanwhile, Reuters reports that heavy rainfall, “which meteorologists link to climate change”, continues across China, causing “flash floods and landslides” that have killed at least seven people. The Independent also covers the story, noting that China has issued “additional…emergency disaster relief funds”. China has issued its “first national heat-health risk warning” as the country prepares for “another wave of extreme temperatures”, aiming to “strengthen public health preparedness amid growing climate challenges”, China Daily says.

Elsewhere, China Daily reports European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi have agreed that the EU and China should “work together to address global challenges such as climate change”. Reuters says that EU foreign affairs head Kaja Kallas also met with Wang, urging China to “put an end to its distortive practices, including its restrictions on rare earths exports”. The state-supporting newspaper Global Times reports Europe is driving “surging demand” for Chinese cooling products, such as air conditioners, following “heatwaves” on the continent.

LNG Canada, the Shell Plc-led project in British Columbia, just exported its first shipment of liquefied natural gas. An even larger plant in Texas — Golden Pass — told US regulators that, after delays, it expects to begin startup activities in October.

This is just the beginning. A series of roughly two dozen new projects from North America to the Middle East is expected to lift export capacity more than 40% by 2030, likely outstripping growth in demand and transforming the market.

For comparison, capacity grew just 8% between 2020 and 2024.

The tidal wave isn’t exactly a shock to the market. Many of these new projects were approved even before the pandemic.

But supply-chain bottlenecks and high costs repeatedly pushed back start dates. The loss of Russian gas to Europe after the invasion of Ukraine further tightened the market, resulting in consistently higher prices that have raised questions about demand from emerging nations.

Now, some Asian buyers are delaying long-term deals precisely because they can see a looming production surge ahead — and better terms.

The catch is that rock-bottom LNG prices — good for nascent gas consumers, if not for the clean-energy transition — aren’t guaranteed.

One key unknown as the market heads into a glut is just how quickly big producers can ramp up output. The US, the world’s top exporter, is forecast to double shipments by 2030, while Qatar wants to lift production 85%.

There’s also the question of Russia’s continued, if troubled, effort to expand LNG exports. With much of its pipeline infrastructure facing Europe, the country has had to look to other means of exporting its gas eastward.

That plan may depend on a more lenient position from Washington, but Moscow has already been trying to restart shipments from a project effectively frozen by US sanctions. It could put even more LNG on the water.

As supply is added, the mood will almost inevitably shift. After years of seller dominance, global gas traders should prepare for a buyers’ market.

Under the IRA, wind and solar projects could receive tax credits up to 2034.
Tax credits for nuclear and geothermal power have been retained until 2036 in the bill.
Ending tax credits for low-carbon manufacturing is also expected to undo progress in building clean technologies, such as solar panels and electric cars, domestically.","President Donald Trump’s dismantling of climate policy means the US will add an extra 7bn tonnes of emissions to the atmosphere from now until 2030, compared to meeting its former climate pledge under the Paris Agreement.

Since winning office last November, he has issued a series of executive orders and is poised to sign his “big beautiful bill” that effectively terminates Biden-era climate policies.

Carbon Brief’s analysis of modelling from the Princeton University REPEAT Project shows that this means US emissions are now set to drop to just 3% below current levels by 2030 – effectively flatlining – rather than falling 40% as required to hit the now-defunct target.

This would leave the US around 2bn tonnes short of its greenhouse-gas emissions target for that year, adding emissions equivalent to around 4% of the current global total each year

To put this in context, it is roughly the annual output of Indonesia, the world’s sixth-largest emitter.

Trump is already withdrawing his nation from its international climate obligations under the Paris Agreement.

The passage of the new Republican-backed “megabill” means that US climate targets pursued by Trump’s predecessor now appear firmly out of reach.

7bn tonnes

Trump is due to sign the so-called “big beautiful bill” into law after it was approved by the Republican-controlled US Congress on 3 July.

This “megabill” removes virtually all of the tax credits for renewable energy, electric vehicles and clean manufacturing that were at the core of Biden’s landmark Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

Since his return to the White House, Trump has moved to strip away his predecessor’s climate policies, including via a series of executive actions. This includes targeting vehicle fuel-efficiency standards and power sector emissions standards.

The passage of the new bill means US solar and wind power expansion will likely slow down, as will sales of electric vehicles and energy efficiency improvements. The combined effect of these policy rollbacks can be seen in the chart below, based on modelling by the REPEAT Project.

Carbon Brief has compared the impact of Trump’s policies, including the megabill, to a pathway on which the US meets its former target, under the Paris Agreement, to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 50-52% from 2005 levels by 2030.

The cumulative gap between this pathway and the Trump administration’s trajectory amounts to 7bn tonnes of emissions over the next five years.

Under this new set of US policies, emissions are only expected to be 20% lower than 2005 levels by 2030, rather than 50-52%, meaning the nation would be 2bn tonnes short of its goal.

This amounts to just a 3% drop from 2024 levels by 2030, meaning emissions are effectively flatlining.

Renewables down, prices up

Among the hundreds of provisions in the new Republican-backed bill are several key rollbacks that are expected to affect US emissions.

Under the IRA, wind and solar projects could receive tax credits up to 2034. Following the Republican bill, most projects would need to start construction within the next year to qualify.

Without federal support, the pipeline of new renewable-energy projects is expected to contract.

The REPEAT analysts estimate that cumulative new solar capacity additions will drop by 29 gigawatts (GW) by 2030 and around 140GW by 2035. For wind power, the decrease is set to be 43GW by 2030 and 160GW by 2035.

Some renewable projects will likely be built without support, but developers will need to contend with other Trump administration policies, such as stopping federal windfarm approvals.

The lost renewable capacity is unlikely to be entirely replaced by fossil fuels, due to a multi-year backlog in the construction of gas-fired power plants.

Tax credits for nuclear and geothermal power have been retained until 2036 in the bill. While these projects generate clean electricity, they can also take a long time to build.

Other key policies in the new bill include the removal of tax credits worth up to $7,500 to purchase electric vehicles, which could result in tens of millions fewer such cars and vans being sold. Ending tax credits for low-carbon manufacturing is also expected to undo progress in building clean technologies, such as solar panels and electric cars, domestically.

Beyond its effect on US emissions, various early analyses have suggested the Republican-backed bill is likely to increase energy prices and lead to job losses.

REPEAT estimates household energy costs are likely to be $165 higher in 2030 and more than $280 higher by 2035, following the passing of the bill.

Some of this increase can be attributed to fewer electric vehicles on the road, leading to higher petrol and diesel consumption and prices. Slowing construction of solar and wind projects as power demand increases will also likely affect the cost of electricity.

Without tax credits to boost the construction of new generation capacity, residential electricity prices are set to increase by 7% – or $110 – by 2026, for the average US customer, according to analysis conducted for trade body the Clean Energy Buyers Association.

In the state of Wyoming, the same analysis found that electricity prices may rise by as much as 30% over the next year. Other firmly Republican states, such as North Carolina and Tennessee, are also expected to see near-term price rises in the double digits.

Methodology

Modelling of the impact of the Trump administration’s “big beautiful bill” is from the REPEAT Project, a joint initiative of the Princeton University ZERO Lab and Evolved Energy Research.

The project has assessed the emissions impact of the executive actions that the Trump administration has already taken to unwind Biden-era policies, as well as the bill itself.

Carbon Brief compared this trajectory out to 2030 with a straight-line pathway towards the official US climate target for 2030. This is set out in the US’ nationally determined contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement. It is worth noting that the Trump administration is withdrawing the US from the Paris Agreement.",https://www.carbonbrief.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/3BNPFJD.jpg,N,,2025-07-04 13:22:12.842619

Together we are forging a path forward for onshore wind in Great Britain, and we are committed to ensuring a successful implementation through a new Onshore Wind Council, which will oversee the execution of the strategy.
James Robottom, Head of Onshore Wind Delivery, RenewableUK, said: Overturning the unpopular onshore wind ban, which deprived us of one of the quickest and cheapest technologies to build for a decade, was just the start.
It is based on achieving the upper end of the capacity range published in the Clean Power 2030 Action Plan.","The amount of clean, homegrown energy from onshore wind is set to accelerate over the second half of the decade as the government launches the first ever onshore wind strategy.

Thousands of new jobs for British people in onshore wind, such as engineering, construction, and operations maintenance, could be created by 2030 to build the onshore wind needed to deliver clean power for families and businesses.

After facing a de-facto 9-year ban in England, today’s strategy sets out over 40 radical actions to get onshore wind building again across the UK. This includes:

unlocking up to 10 GW of onshore wind by resolving issues with how onshore wind turbines and aerospace civil and defence infrastructure co-exist

repowering of old turbines across the country, so we can maintain our current fleet and keep powering the country with clean, secure, homegrown power

equipping planners and developers with the tools needed for the first English projects since we lifted the de facto ban last year. This includes making sure planning decisions are based on up-to-date information and ensuring site surveying and assessments for projects are more efficient to speed up decision-making

exploring plans to expand the clean industry bonus for onshore wind, encouraging developers to invest in supply chains in the UK’s industrial heartlands, or in cleaner supply chains

Today’s strategy bolsters the strong foundations the government has built since taking office to get the industry moving again, such as lifting the ban in England and reintroducing onshore wind into the Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects regime. These measures mean that onshore wind will be put on an equal footing to offshore wind and nuclear, meaning projects can get built quicker in the years to come.

Delivering this strategy could more than double the current onshore wind workforce, supporting up to 45,000 skilled jobs across the country by 2030, as the government pursues its clean power ambition of 27-29 GW of onshore wind by 2030.

Clean energy is the economic opportunity of the twenty-first century, and thanks to the government’s clean energy mission, investment is booming in the UK, with over £40 billion of private investment in clean energy announced since July.

Onshore wind is one of the easiest and cheapest technologies to build and will supply British homes and businesses with clean, secure homegrown power that ends a reliance on unstable global gas markets – all part of the mission to get bills down for good.

Energy Minister Michael Shanks said:

Rolling out more onshore wind is a no-brainer – it’s one of our cheapest technologies, quick to build, supports thousands of skilled jobs and can provide clean energy directly to the communities hosting it.

After years of decline, we’re giving industry the tools to get building again, backing industrial renewal and secure, clean, homegrown energy through our Plan for Change.

Matthieu Hue, co-chair of the Onshore Wind Taskforce and CEO of EDF Power Solutions UK and Ireland, said:

This strategy is focusing on overcoming barriers and challenges we face across the industry in the deployment of onshore wind while capturing the major socio-economic benefits it can bring to the environment and to local economies.

Together we are forging a path forward for onshore wind in Great Britain, and we are committed to ensuring a successful implementation through a new Onshore Wind Council, which will oversee the execution of the strategy. This is a critical part of making Britain a clean energy superpower and delivering energy security.

Communities are set to benefit too with the voluntary community benefits guidance for onshore wind for England being updated to provide communities with £5,000 per megawatt per year for community initiatives, such as new football pitches or libraries, or even bill discount schemes.

By delivering the upper Clean Power 2030 ambition of 29 GW of onshore wind, it’s estimated that an additional £70 million of community funding will be unlocked for rural towns and villages every year.

Today’s measures come as the government has completed a process to de-risk offshore wind developments, led by the Marine Spatial Prioritisation Programme, thus unleashing the potential for offshore wind development in the English sea in the future.

This will help guide The Crown Estate’s Marine Delivery Routemap on strategic use of the seabed to unlock offshore wind in a way that considers all marine sectors including fisheries and protects the marine environment.

This should also reduce the planning consent risk for developers on future offshore wind sites before seabed rights are tendered – speeding up and de-risking future offshore wind projects.

Stakeholders

Sue Ferns, Senior Deputy General Secretary of Prospect, said:

Onshore wind has an important role to play in a secure and decarbonised energy mix so it is welcome that the government is taking steps to support its rollout.

However, the lost years resulting from the last government’s inexplicable ban have resulted in significant workforce and skills related challenges that urgently need to be addressed, which hopefully they will be in the forthcoming Clean Energy Workforce Plan.

It is also important that renewables such as onshore wind generate good, unionised jobs - if the government wants the clean energy transition to be fair and to deliver the full economic potential, it must insist on this as a condition for the support it provides.

James Robottom, Head of Onshore Wind Delivery, RenewableUK, said:

Overturning the unpopular onshore wind ban, which deprived us of one of the quickest and cheapest technologies to build for a decade, was just the start. The hard work to make the most of this great opportunity to grow our economy and strengthen the UK’s energy security is now in full swing.

This strategy sets an ambitious target to almost double the UK’s onshore wind capacity by the end of the decade as a key part of the government’s Clean Power by 2030 mission.

The measures outlined will increase confidence among investors and developers, so that we can attract billions in private investment and create thousands of highly-skilled jobs and new supply chains all over the country. The strategy also sets out how people living near onshore wind farms will continue to see tailor-made community benefits through an updated Community Benefit Protocol for England, deciding for themselves the form that these benefits should take, to support and improve the lives of those in areas hosting onshore wind.

Duncan Wilson, Chief Executive, Historic England said:

Historic England constructively engages with major infrastructure delivery in a way that secures good outcomes for the heritage that people care about. We therefore welcome recognition of our role and the contribution of our advice in the Onshore Wind Taskforce strategy to delivery of the renewables agenda. In line with the strategy we will be updating our commercial renewables guidance.

Claire Mack OBE, Chief Executive of Scottish Renewables, said:

Scotland has a proud history in onshore wind and the bold strategy published today reaffirms how central the Scottish onshore wind sector will be to the UK’s clean power journey.

Onshore wind is a cost-effective source of clean energy that can be deployed at pace, supporting skilled jobs and tangible community benefit. Making the most of our onshore wind resource will also strengthen our energy security in the years ahead.

Scottish Renewables secured the landmark Scottish Onshore Wind Sector Deal in 2023 and the clear actions published today will build on this effort by tackling the issues that demand close working across the UK.

Renewed commitments on planning efficiency, grid connections, radar and aviation in the strategy are all strong signals of intent by the UK and Scottish governments to boost onshore wind deployment. We will work closely with all stakeholders to deliver the strategy and determine the pathway beyond 2030 for the Scottish onshore wind sector.

Lisa Christie, Head of UK Regulatory Affairs, Vattenfall, said:

This government’s renewed focus on unlocking the potential of onshore wind is essential for the UK’s energy security, reducing bills, and economic growth. Proposals to resolve challenges around aviation infrastructure and to give local planning teams the tools and information they need to make faster, evidence-based decisions are especially important.

The socio-economic contribution made by renewables developers means communities also benefit from significant benefit packages that reflect local priorities. This flexibility should be maintained for future developments. Further investment can also be encouraged by ruling out zonal pricing, which risks creating further imbalances in consumer bills.

Christine McGregor, Managing Director at BayWa r.e. UK Ltd, said:

We are delighted with the UK government’s leadership in convening the industry to develop the first ever onshore wind strategy. This marks a significant and timely step towards strengthening the onshore wind sector in Great Britain and advancing the ambitions of the Clean Power 2030 initiative.

Eleri Davies, Head of Onshore Wind Development (England & Wales), RWE, said:

The Clean Power Action plan sets an ambitious target to double onshore wind capacity by 2030, and today’s Strategy firmly establishes the clear actions required to achieve this. We look forward to the newly established Onshore Wind Council driving these actions forward.

With over 2 decades of experience in developing and operating onshore wind in the UK, RWE knows firsthand the benefits that it can bring to host communities, with over £3.5 million awarded to local communities from onshore wind funds in the UK last year alone. Onshore wind is also one of the cheapest sources of electricity, therefore breaking down barriers to accelerate its deployment will help reduce bills for all consumers.

Laura Fleming, Country Managing Director, Hitachi Energy UK & Ireland, said:

We strongly welcome moves to grow the onshore wind industry and welcome with open arms the fast deployment of affordable renewable energy. Rapid deployment is critical to delivering Clean Power 2030 and we stand ready to work with government to deliver a grid that enables the growth of the onshore wind and wider renewables sector. As a member of the Onshore Wind Taskforce, we are fully committed to capturing this opportunity to deliver clean power and industrial growth in UK.

Lucy Whitford, Managing Director UK&I Development & Construction, RES, said:

The onshore wind strategy will unleash the true potential of this vital technology for the nation.

The policy direction and practical support outlined, will strengthen our energy security and support £70 million per year of extra investment in local economies across length and breadth of the country.

We’re prepared and ready to work alongside government, local authorities, industry partners and communities to implement this strategy.

Gillian Noble, Managing Director, Onshore Origination & Development at ScottishPower Renewables said:

The intent, direction, and focus of this strategy is exactly what’s needed to revitalise the onshore wind industry in England, whilst also aiming to resolve key blockers to onshore wind projects already in development in other areas of the UK.

It’s been fantastic to be part of such a collaborative working group and we welcome the government’s approach in mobilising industry experts to advise and support to help push things forward. We’re excited about the potential to unlock gigawatts of onshore projects and thousands of new jobs as we contribute to the government’s Clean Power 2030 mission and beyond.

Notes to editors

See the full ‘Onshore wind strategy’.

The methodology underpinning our estimate that onshore wind could support up to 45,000 direct and indirect jobs in Great Britain by 2030 is published here: Job estimates for wind generation by 2030: methodology note. It is based on achieving the upper end of the capacity range published in the Clean Power 2030 Action Plan.

The additional £70 million of community funding has been derived as the difference between the upper 29 GW ambition in 2030 and operational capacity in Great Britain as of December 2024 (15 GW), multiplied by £5,000 per MW.

The claim that onshore wind is amongst our cheapest technologies is based on a combination of sources, including the results of last year’s CfD auction (Allocation Round 6, where onshore wind cleared at a similar price to solar PV, the lowest price technology in the auction), and published evidence on electricity generation costs.

The ‘up to 10 GW impacted by aviation/radar’ is taken from the RenewableUK 2023 Survey of Onshore Wind Impacts on Aviation and Defence. This indicated that up to circa 10 GW of the future onshore wind pipeline is either currently or anticipated to be affected by objections on the grounds of interference with aviation and defence infrastructure.

In a letter made public Monday, the employees wrote that the agency is no longer living up to its mission to protect human health and the environment. The letter represented rare public criticism from agency employees who knew they could face blowback for speaking out against a weakening of funding and federal support for climate, environmental and health science.

In a statement Thursday, the EPA said it has a “zero-tolerance policy for career bureaucrats unlawfully undermining, sabotaging and undercutting” the Trump administration’s agenda.

Employees were notified that they had been placed in a “temporary, non-duty, paid status” for the next two weeks, pending an “administrative investigation,” according to a copy of the email obtained by The Associated Press. “It is important that you understand that this is not a disciplinary action,” the email read.

More than 170 EPA employees put their names to the document, with about 100 more signing anonymously out of fear of retaliation, according to Jeremy Berg, a former editor-in-chief of Science magazine who is not an EPA employee but was among non-EPA scientists or academics to also sign.

Scientists at the National Institutes of Health made a similar move in June, when nearly 100 employees signed a declaration that assailed Trump administration “policies that undermine the NIH mission, waste public resources, and harm the health of Americans and people across the globe.” An additional 250 of their colleagues endorsed the declaration without using their names.

But no one at NIH has been placed on administrative leave for signing the declaration and there has been no known retribution against them, Jenna Norton, a lead organizer of the statement, told AP on Thursday. Norton oversees health disparity research at the agency’s National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.

NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya, in his confirmation hearings, had pledged openness to views that might conflict with his own, saying dissent is the “essence of science.”

Under Administrator Lee Zeldin, EPA has cut funding for environmental improvements in minority communities, vowed to roll back federal regulations that lower air pollution in national parks and tribal reservations, wants to undo a ban on a type of asbestos and proposed repealing rules that limit planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions from power plants fueled by coal and natural gas.

Zeldin began reorganizing the EPA’s research and development office as part of his push to slash its budget and gut its study of climate change and environmental justice. And he’s seeking to roll back pollution rules that an AP examination found were estimated to save 30,000 lives and $275 billion every year.

The EPA responded to the employees’ letter earlier this week by saying policy decisions “are a result of a process where Administrator Zeldin is briefed on the latest research and science by EPA’s career professionals, and the vast majority who are consummate professionals who take pride in the work this agency does day in and day out.”

The House of Representatives narrowly approved President Donald Trump’s tax-cut legislation on 3 July 2024, after the Senate passed it on 1 July 2024.

This legislation extends his 2017 tax cuts and makes them permanent, introduces new tax breaks, cuts health and food safety net programs, and, most notably, eliminates green energy incentives. It also potentially eliminates tax credits for wind and solar energy established in 2005 and expedites the abolition of clean energy manufacturing tax credits.

The EV tax credits have boosted EV sales since their introduction in 2008 and expansion in 2022. The bill also benefits automakers by removing penalties for failing Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, making it easier to produce gasoline vehicles.

Clean Air Council

Alex Bomstein, Clean Air Council Executive Director, issued the following statement in response--

“218 Republicans just raised energy bills and shrunk the economy across the country. This terrible bill will soil our air, shorten our lives, and empty our wallets by damaging programs meant to reduce pollution and create jobs.

“Stunting the growth of the clean energy industry just when we need it most is the worst way our government could respond to the climate crisis.

“Our elected officials should be securing a sustainable future for their constituents, not putting them directly and demonstrably in harm’s way.”

Clean Air Council is an environmental nonprofit founded in 1967 that works through public education, community action, government oversight, and enforcement of environmental laws to protect everyone’s right to a healthy environment.

Evangelical Environmental Network

Evangelical Environmental Network President and CEO Rev. Dr. Jessica Moerman released this statement commenting on the federal action--

While the Evangelical Environmental Network (EEN) commends several meaningful agriculture conservation wins included in the bill, we are gravely concerned about deeply counterproductive rollbacks of fiscally responsible pollution protections and curtailed freedom for communities, churches, and families to choose clean energy.

""As champions for responsible stewardship of God’s creation, we commend the historic $16 billion investment in America’s farmers to fully and faithfully carry out agricultural conservation practices as well as the extension of the 45Z clean fuel credit that has the potential to be the most impactful policy in a generation for conservation and agricultural innovation.

“We also welcome the preservation of key tax credits for clean, firm technologies–like geothermal and advanced nuclear–that will deliver the low-emission baseload energy of the future.

""We lament, however, the abrupt termination of vital incentives for wind, solar, and residential energy efficiency.

“The dismantling of the technology-neutral incentives for clean electricity is against conservative commonsense, stifling innovation, threatening grid stability, and standing in opposition to a market-based approach where the government doesn’t pick energy winners or losers but instead rewards performance over special-interest preference.

""We are grateful to IS Senators Grassley and Ernst, as well as Representatives Miller-Meeks (IA-1), Garbarino (NY-2), Kiggans (VA-2), and others for their courageous leadership to stem the abrupt termination of renewable technologies that are crucial to meeting today’s growing energy demand with lower costs to families and reduced harmful impacts on human life.

""Finally, we lament the bill’s ten-year delay of the methane waste fee and rollback of long-overdue oil and gas royalty rate reforms.

“These provisions would have generated billions in revenue critical to offsetting growing deficits while simultaneously reducing pollution that costs us our health.

“At a time of exploding national debt, eliminating these meaningful revenue streams is both an environmental and fiscal failure.""

The Pennsylvania-based Evangelical Environmental Network is a ministry whose mission is to inspire, equip, educate, and mobilize evangelical Christians to love God and others by rediscovering and reclaiming the Biblical mandate to care for creation and working toward a stable climate and a healthy, pollution-free world.

Kathleen: Hey, this is Kathleen. Before we get started, the Living Planet team has some exciting news. Starting in September, we'll be devoting a regular episode to answering your questions. Questions you have about the environment and climate change, questions about an episode you've heard, or even questions about us you can write to us in the comment section on Apple, Spotify, YouTube or your favorite podcast app.

Or you can send us a good old fashioned e-mail at livingplanet@dw.com. That's living as in “not dead” and planet as in “the place we all live” at dw.com.

Thanks and we can't wait to hear from you. Now let's start the show there.

Sam: There we go.

Kathleen: Now I can hear you. Can I hear me?

Charli: Hello. Hello. Hello, hello.

Neil: Oh wow, that’s loud. So do you need any more talking, Michael?

Sam: From me, ok, what else can I talk about? I am so brain dead.

Kathleen: Do you bring the right script this time?

Neil: Yeah, this time I think I've got notes.

Charli: I think we should say who we are.

Sam: Yeah, I think you should include that.

Neil: Right, well, in that case, I think we can just start right from the top. I'm Neil King.

Kathleen: I'm Kathleen Schuster.

Neil: And for this episode of Living Planet, we sat down with producers Charli Shield and Sam Baker to talk about their eye-opening series, “The true cost of climate change,” which came out in April.

Kathleen: If you haven't heard it yet, you can find all five episodes in our podcast feed.

Neil: And if you’re new to the series don’t worry you can still listen to this episode.

Kathleen: We talk about what listeners have been saying.

Sam: And I was like, OK, an economist signed off on it. I think we did OK.

Neil: What didn't make it in.

Charli: I definitely have mixed feelings at the end of it, but doing the series, it's clear we're not out of ideas for solutions.

Kathleen: And more.

Charli: And I did say to Brent at the end of our interview, I said, “Has anyone ever told you that you're made for radio your voice?” And he was like, “It's been mentioned a few times.”

Neil: Cost of climate change brand new series, done and dusted. Charli, Sam, how do you feel now?

It was quite a long process. You traveled for this series you reported from Australia, from the US, from Europe, Germany. And you packed a hell of a lot in. And today we'll also be talking about some of the stuff that didn't make it in. Not because it wasn't good enough, but because you just found so much good stuff, right?

But how does it feel now in general now that the series is done?

Charli: Sam's looking at me. I feel good. I'm glad it's over. I think it was super interesting to work on. It was really engrossing and it required a lot of research, but I loved working on it and I'm glad it's out in the world, yeah.

Sam: I feel like we just scratched the surface, to be honest. I feel like I could make a whole podcast about this. Maybe not that much, but yeah, I think there's so much more to explore in the intersection of economics and, you know, just our, like, daily money quandaries and climate change.

It had before been kind of a area I hadn't looked into very much. But the problem is only going to grow and become more clear in our economies, so I'm sure there will be more reporting on that.

Neil: Yeah, I mean the also the figures that you packed in there, I think in every episode I learned something new and some of the figures it was really eye-opening. It was like, oh wow, I did not know that that is a huge figure and you put it into context as well and just highlighted just how precious the environment really is and what it contributes to our economies as well, because I think a lot of people still try to separate those two, but you can't really, or at least that's my main take away from this series that you really shouldn't separate the two.

But yeah, Kathleen, what about you? What stuck with you the most from this series?

Kathleen: Well, it wasn't actually any of the numbers, though. Those were always really eye opening. And there was so much good information. But the thing that I find myself thinking about the most, strangely enough is, Sam, your interview with Catherine McKenna, because there was something I just really appreciated about the fact that she was just openly saying, “We kept getting the name wrong for the carbon tax. And just by the way, don't call it a carbon tax.”

And there was something very like a little bit like “Veep” about that. Like, you know, just kind of like we're not getting this right and it just felt very human and it's not usually how we hear about environmental politics of yeah, we're also trying to figure out how to do this the best way and we keep messing up, but we keep trying.

Yeah, there was just something really humorous about that, but also a serious message in there too, of it's a tough, tough job and there are a lot of people who care very much, but they're not immune to accidentally, not picking the right word like in terms of PR.

But yeah, I'm sure I could go on there were there are just so many things. But what about you, Neil?

Neil: I mean, one thing I really do remember thinking, wow and sitting back was the final episode with the kelp forests. There were quite a few stats in there. I mean, I didn't know much about kelp forests to begin with. I first thought, well, kelp forest, what did they even look like? I didn't know.

And then that the fact that they can grow 30 centimeters a day. I was like, wow, I want that in my garden.

Mick Baron: Diving through the kelp forest is a unique experience, but effectively flying through a tall tree forest 3 dimensional not just looking up, but looking down looking down these massive great plants and then looking up because it has a canopy as well so it spreads out on the surface.

So when it's really thick, you're down in 20 meters of water and you're looking up these massive great trunks effectively. And the and the sunlight dappling through the canopy on the surface. It's it is a very unique experience, no question about that.

Neil: And then the other fact was also the value that they were valued at like $500 billion per year. These six major kelp forests that exist in the world or the the six biggest and one of them that you you went to in Tasmania Charlie, right, the one of the kelp forests and and that $500 billion, the reason that resonated with me so much, because that is pretty much exactly the German federal budget. It's a bit short of that, but that's the German federal budget for 2025.

And as a German taxpayer, I was just sitting there thinking, wait a minute... kelp forests? You know just that connection that that really brought it home to me. But yeah, also, I mean the protagonists. You have so many charismatic people in there. And yeah, I think we'll we'll talk a bit more about those later.

Kathleen: There is one other thing that I meant to say that I found really interesting. And that was in the very first episode when you were talking about hurricanes, somebody who has been through a number of tropical storms and tropical depressions and hurricanes, I was absolutely shocked at the description of the storm surge coming so far in and that they saw fish like going down the street.

And I thought, that was something I had never thought about. Number one, I thought maybe the fish were still way far out at sea. Maybe somehow they were spared from the the surge, which doesn't make any sense, but also because the kind of community where they were living, that's really uncommon for the storm surge to reach that far. And that I found eye opening having yeah, been through those experiences where if you're in a safe area, it's a really serious storm. It's a bad storm, but it's not like.

Like that sort of description that actually it reminded me of something I read in a novel once about, like what, Like a hurricane in the early 20th century and how it swept through an entire town and I thought that is really alarming. Really, really alarming.

Sam: Yeah, I got a new appreciation for hurricanes, for sure. Working on that episode. I mean, I've lived through tornadoes in the Midwest. But it's like a thunderstorm and a tornado and a flood. Basically they it's, you know, multiple disasters, all kind of wrapped up into one terrible storm.

Maria Blancett: We looked out our front window to the lake, across the street from our house and the lake and the road were one. And the road was a raging river was like the ocean. There were white caps going down the street. There were fish in the road. It was pretty scary, but it never came up to our house. It came within 10 feet of our front door. And that's when we realized maybe this isn't are forever home.

Neil: I was also wondering, you know, because you've also been doing environment stories for such a long time and you've also worked on other podcasts as well. What sort of feedback have you been getting from the people who usually listen to your work on this series? Has it been different?

Charli: Yeah, I mean, it's always a little bit of a risk with this series. You hope people will stay and they'll keep listening to each episode. But yeah, we had some really nice feedback about the stories taking people in to these issues and then just talking about some more fundamental stuff that I think often you kind of forget about when you're reading environmental news day-to-day.

Sam: I think the best, most relieving piece of feedback was from one of the economists we interviewed who said he not only like shared this with his network, but also with his students, he's a professor and I was like, OK, an economist signed off on it, I think we did OK yeah.

Neil: Very cool. Yeah, I mean, that also deals with what listeners wrote in most of the listeners. I think the common theme there was eye opening, brilliantly produced. That was sort of a recurring theme. And there's one listener e-mail I'd like to just read out. It's from Australia, from a man called Peter Croft in Adelaide.

And yeah, I shortened it just a little bit, but I'm going to read it out. So this is Peter Croft.

“I listened to your latest podcast on who's paying for the next hurricane on ABC Radio in Australia a couple of hours ago. Terrific story. Well done. I am an older Australian who is part of a climate change group at Council of the Aging South Australia. The cost of house insurance is a real issue for older people.

The issue is that as extreme weather events occur, those who are affordability stressed may choose not to insure or to under insure their houses. This means that their next storm or flood can render them potentially homeless. We are trying to raise awareness of the issue. New Zealand has an excellent scheme to cover earthquakes and their approach may be useful elsewhere. Thank you for the work that you do.

Sam: Hmm, that's nice. We'll have to check out what New Zealand is doing. I'm curious now about the specifics, but yeah, I think that's something that a lot of it's it's good, he points out older homeowners are thinking about people who thought, OK, I've paid my house off, you know, 10-15 years ago. I'm good to go for retirement, but you still have to pay your insurance every year, and if that becomes astronomical, you know that can take over your budget and either you, pay it and don't have much leftover or you let it go, which can really hurt you in the next disaster.

Neil: Just to balance things out, of course there was also some critique. Not much, but there was one listener who actually had a suggestion or a bit of critique.

Kathleen: Yeah, there was one listener who wrote in from the US who said, “I really enjoyed the cost of climate change series. However, I'm always frustrated that these conversations never touch on animal agriculture. It's a huge contributor to greenhouse gases, and it's the leading cause of deforestation and biodiversity loss. Also, it's one thing that most individuals can actually do to make significant difference. Please, please talk about this because people can and should reduce consumption of animal products!!

Two exclamation points. So what do you all have to say about that?

Charli: Yeah, we didn't dig too much into animal agriculture in there. So, agriculture, especially animal agriculture, is a huge contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions. It's not the top one, but it definitely as this listener points out, is a is a major contributor.

So the largest contributors to global greenhouse gas emissions are electricity and heat production. That's followed by transport, manufacturing, construction and agriculture. So that's the global overview. But it does differ from country to country.

So in the US, for example, the transport sector contributes a lot to emissions overall, US emissions, much more so than the global average.

And in Brazil the top sources of emissions are agriculture and land use change, and I'm getting my data here from our world in data and that's a data tracking and analysis hub project from the University of Oxford in the UK and the global Change Data Lab.

Sam: And we should say this listener is totally right, it's one of best things you can personally do in your own life because so many of the things you just listed, Charli, are, you know, national or global, and they take much bigger systemic change to change them and to, you know, bring in a new system. Whereas, yes, you can make decisions about your diet in your own life that are pretty simple to implement so.

Charli: But just to that point also it's not just about veganism for everybody tomorrow. It really is just about less. Consuming, less, so any reduction helps.

Neil: And also again the price, right cause meat is too cheap where we live. I think that again the money comes back in right, the price tag.

Kathleen: So that was one big topic that didn't make it in. And there were a lot of really interesting details and even interviewees who didn't make the cut just because we had to keep things to time. And we only had so many episodes.

So tell us a little bit about. Yeah, the things that you unfortunately had to leave out.

Sam: Well, like I said before there was just kind of so much to explore and this always happens. You have to leave a few things on the cutting room floor, but one of the things I had wanted to look at in the first episode about climate disasters and the cost of those particularly hurricanes, is how much taxpayers end up footing that bill.

I've always kind of wondered about this, and it was something we just enough time to get into. We looked at how much insurance companies are are shelling out or withdrawing from certain states. And we looked at how this affects homeowners and the cost that they incur.

But this does kind of hit all Americans, at least in this example. I would imagine it is the case in other countries, too, in that there is some part of disasters that we foot the bill for. So, I spoke to one economist who has worked in mortgage finance on Wall Street for large investors and also, importantly, for Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.

These are large government sponsored companies that guarantee mortgages in the US for home buyers and he's actually testified to the US Senate before about how some of these programs that the government has to cover homes in particularly flood zones are kind of a looming financial crisis waiting to happen because the flood maps are outdated and that the data is kind of not up to par with what it should be telling homeowners and the government.

So you have these homes that are kind of overvalued and really dangerous zones.

So maybe we can hear him explain that a little bit more.

Sean Becketti: I worked for a large mortgage originator that did a lot of business in subprime that turned out very, very badly and led to the largest bank failure in U.S. history.

So, when we look at a lot of the climate risk issues, there's steady evidence of an increase in very expensive natural disasters and there seems to be a lot of reluctance to make rapid changes now that are gonna be expensive and painful if the day of reckoning has not quite arrived yet.

Sam: So he was specifically speaking to me about one program, the National Flood Insurance program, again, that is these homes and and flood zones.

But unlike the financial crisis that we saw back in 2007, 2008, where home prices did eventually kind of come back up, if you're in a really dangerous climate zone, whether that's from flooding or a hurricane, the value of your home is just going to go down and down and down over time. So there's kind of no recovery if that crisis comes to pass.

Which, as someone who has to file my US taxes every every year, concerns me quite a bit. I don't knowa about you, Kathleen, but...

Kathleen: I think it's first thing that comes to mind and is kind of making my heart stop a bit is that I'm from the Southeast and people have seen the value of their homes just explode and are completely ecstatic about all the money they could make from their homes. You know, just growing a lot in value over the past years because so many people are moving to the Southeast as a result of climate change, for example, from the West Coast.

As a result, also like post pandemic, though, I think that trend is starting to reverse, like leaving the bigger cities and just wanting more space. And also because the Southeast tends to be a part of the country where there are very low taxes. So it's very attractive place to live. And so I know a lot of people who are like, “Oh great, my house used to be worth this much now it's like doubled in value within like 3 years.”

And when I hear that, you know it, it makes me worry that people are getting their hopes up and something bad can happen. And then all of a sudden their plans that are now centered around how much money they might get out of their houses could. Yeah, just evaporate.

Sam: So, yeah, in that part of the country last year, we saw a bit of that, North Carolina, Tennessee Hurricane Helene came into areas that thought they weren't in flood zones. But again because.

Kathleen: Yeah, Asheville, North Carolina, which is up in the mountains, flooded.

Sam: Yeah. Exactly. So yeah, I think that's something people need to look into a bit more and also all of us who pay taxes, you know, thinking about the fact that we are paying for people to rebuild again and again in these places that are getting more dangerous and at what point do we look to our elected officials and say, OK, enough is enough? We have to think about kind of managed retreat from some of these areas.

Kathleen: Yeah, it's a. It's a huge question. I can only imagine what that would mean. If you're really trying to understand the global view, because from country to country, the tax system is going to be different. The social safety net is completely different and emergency services are completely different. And we're also watching that slowly be dismantled in the US...so, what else didn't make of it?

Neil: Well, I was wondering about the relocation thing more. There are precedents for that, aren't there, where people have been relocated, I think in the Mississippi or on the Mississippi, where they were paid to actually up and leave. And they were offered new housing. I do wonder whether such programs, you know, how much incentive there is there for people to actually give up their homes if they've lived in a place for generations?

Sam: Actually, Sean actually told me about a couple of these examples. I think it was in Louisiana in that part of the country that gets hurricanes and and they have offered people money to move. But he said, you know, a lot of people don't take it. Even though in the long term it's kind of the smarter financial choice, not yet.

Neil: Because what you do then right, then you can't evict them. There's no legislation for that, is there?

Sam: Not yet.

Neil: We'll be right back.

TRAILER “Threshold”

Sam: Yeah, so you had mentioned before, Kathleen, Catherine McKenna, who is a former Environment Minister of Canada. And yeah, one of the most interesting interviews I think I've ever done, just incredibly candid. And I also appreciated her kind of, I guess it's Midwestern Canada. I don't know what they call that part of the country, but it reminded me of the part of the US I'm from, too, just kind of straight talking.

So she talked about just how difficult it is to decarbonize Canada. And we looked at some other examples in that episode, too.

But one thing I would have liked to get into more, and we just kind of ran out of time for, with how countries in the Global South are dealing with this transition countries that just have less money available to them to make this transition.

And I think they also have a unique, very different opportunity, whereas places like Canada are trying to kind of, you know, pull their energy system over to a new energy system. Countries in the Global South, they're often building their energy system. So it also looks a bit different. But yeah, I think this is one area that there's a lot of conversation about the economics of it going on.

So I did speak to an expert Sangeeth Selvaraju, a policy fellow at the Grantham Research Institute at the London School of Economics. He looks at climate finance and emerging markets like India, so he's all over this topic. And he told me this figure that, overall for the Global South, these countries need $2.5 trillion per year in order to transition to clean energy. So $2.5 trillion every year.

But let me break that number down a little bit.

So basically, $1.5 trillion of that, they're already funding themselves. Another half a trillion is going to come from private finance from companies that want to invest in solar or wind or whatever in these countries.

But there's a final half, a trillion that's still kind of unaccounted for. And this is where some of these big global discussions about climate finance really get heated: Who exactly should pay for it? And yeah, maybe we can just hear from him. What kind of explaining that? And the complications of that a little bit.

Sangeeth Selvaraju: Where does the rest of the money come from going forward?

And what are the avenues for that in the world that we live in today? So as we all know and as we are seeing around the world, development aid budgets are being cut.

In a landscape of competing local priorities for different countries, particularly in the developed world. Of course, US aid is one of the key examples, but budgets are being cut in the UK, budgets are being cut in other European countries as well.

Sam: I mean, we're seeing this as well here in Germany. Yeah, the US is a big one, obviously in the news lately. But how we meet this gap for, for transitioning the energy of countries in the Global South is a big question.

And you know, there's a lot of argument about these countries should be able to develop in the same way that wealthier countries have in the past and also that wealthier countries like the US have huge historic emissions and are kind of, should pay up for that. Should should make up for what they've consumed before.

But as we heard, you know, throughout the series, politics usually gets in the way of this. And that seems just kind of unlikely. So, I I also wanted to know from Sangeeth, like, what's the economic argument behind this? And I thought he had a pretty good answer to that.

Sangeeth Selvaraju: So if we were to, for a brief moment, set aside. The historic responsibilities climate impacts don't know borders. Climate impacts don't care whether you were born in some part of the world or the other. Climate impacts hit everybody. I mean, just in the second-half of last year, we saw flooding in Valencia, you know, causing hundreds of billions of euros of damage, taking lives. We saw Hurricane Helene in South Carolina and North Carolina, you know, damaging and causing billions of damages.

So these impacts will only intensify as we are already beginning to see the wildfires in California and others, there's many others we can go on if we don't think about this as a global problem, we simply will not be. It will be a challenge to solve it. So from an entirely economic point of view, if you want to mitigate the frequency of these these events of climate impacts, which are clearly already increasing but will only intensify if we don't think about what to do, the costs will be astronomical.

Kathleen: And it really gets to the heart of your whole miniseries.

Sam: Yeah, I think as we're all becoming more aware of maybe recently, like the economy is so globally connected, we don't exist. Just as individuals are in a vacuum, and it's kind of like climate change in a way. Yeah, there's always kind of push and pull factors and you can't kind of just extricate yourself from that.

Kathleen: Yeah. And also I loved what he had to say about borders because I can't tell you the number of times I've heard somebody made make a comment to the effect of, well, you know, “Who cares if this one country in Europe lowers their emissions? It won't make a difference.”

And you know, I mean, yeah, on a global scale, we have a huge problem. But it does make a difference if every country is trying to do something, yeah, so.

Charli: On that point, I did ask ecological economist, Sophus zu Ermgassen, and who we heard from in episode five, what he thought the most urgent economic reforms we need right now to protect nature at scale for the benefit of all of us, the global population. And he said that that would be funding a clean energy transition, clean economic growth in the Global South. And I have a clip from him about that.

Sophus zu Ermgassen: The majority of the world's remaining biodiversity tends to be in the Global South and in tropical areas, and that's partly because a big chunk of the Global North extracted all of its resources from its nature, from its biodiversity as a way of fuelling its economic expansion and industrialization.

A big chunk of the widely perceived economic success of the Global North has come from the destruction of its natural resources. So I would strongly advocate for economic policy reforms that lead to the Global North paying their fair share to emerging Global South economies to skip the dirty economic model that we used and try and find a better way. I mean I genuinely believe the Global North owes a massive climate and nature debt to the Global South and I would really emphasize economic policy reforms that put this, this kind of climate and nature justice at the heart of them.

Kathleen: When we talk about things getting left out, I think that's such a strong statement. But everything and the episodes were strong statements, so.

Neil: But the I mean one of the things that also came through in the series, you know that the polluters should be paying, they should be paying more. They're not doing it. And that's where also one, you know, with the economic system, it's all geared towards growth. Profits are rewarded, financial profits. It's all about generating that and where I do wonder whether if we could change that mindset and rather have a scenario where companies are rewarded, who actually are clean. And that you change the taxation system in that regard and reward that rather than somebody who has huge returns for their investors. But yeah, obviously we're not there yet.

Sam: I think some countries are trying to do that essentially that's, I mean the flip side of carbon tax.

Neil: Yeah, but beyond carbon tax, obviously, carbon is definitely very important. But I mean, there's other forms of pollution, you know, in terms of, I don't know, plastics or whatever.

Sam: And I think it is happening any anyway, I mean like with episode two. I was thinking about that. Te clean energy companies are making money like, that's why they're doing what they're doing ultimately. And you're seeing fossil fuel companies kind of start to freak out a little bit.

So yeah, it's probably not going as fast as it needs to, but I think those economic pressures are starting to show up in certain parts of the transition.

Neil: The risks are probably growing for that kind of business model.

Sam: I mean, and this is an issue that's like getting pushed, pushed on in a non- economic way in the US of like not letting investment companies have ESG funds, environment, social governance funds because they're against these like green funds, but actually they make a lot of sense for investment companies because they don't want stranded assets. But yeah, that's probably a whole new thing.

Charli: Yeah, I think self is alluded to some different motivations for a different kind of economic model in episode five. But I think that's another episode as well.

Neil: OK, there's one thing that kind of came up in a team meeting yesterday I thought was interesting because we're talking about the protagonists in your series, and particularly the protagonists that you found Charli, right? Very charismatic men called Brent and Mick.

Kathleen: From Australia.

Neil: From Australia. And I don't know the the reaction from the female colleagues was kind of interesting.

Kathleen: Thought the the female contingent got a bit swoony and...

Charli: Oh really? What happened?

Kathleen: Well, I'm going to take myself out of that one, actually, because I think no offense. No, Bt I I had a moment in the meeting where I zoned out for a second, then all of a sudden there were two female colleagues who were kind of swooning about these men, and I was like, what is going on? Do you have any insights into what was going on?

Charli: Well, you heard that voices.

Sam: Some rugged Australian.

Charli: Rugged Auzzie blokes as I described them. Yeah, I don't know what to say about that.

Neil: How was it meeting these guys?

Kathleen: I must say I was enormously pleased when I first heard their voices on the phone and I thought, yeah, this is going to work out very well.

And I did say to Brent, at the end of our interview, I said, “Has anyone ever told you that you're made for radio your voice?”

And he was like, “It's been mentioned a few times.”

Neil: Well, he had this very deep voice, which was really, really, I mean, it was. It was quite amazing listening to it. I do remember listening to it was really, really nice. Everybody is to go back into the podcast feed, wherever you get your podcast and check this out. Mick and Brent, my two favorite voices on, you know the whole series.

Kathleen: Even Neil was swooning.

Charli: Not just the women were swooning.

Kathleen: It's Pedro Pascal level swooning. No, but I have a question for you, Sam, actually, I don't know how to phrase this in a polite way, but going back to Florida, what really struck me was these people are living in a very dangerous place. I, too, have lived in Florida. What the heck is going on with Floridians that they're so happy despite all these hurricanes?

Sam: That's a good question. I mean, I am someone who doesn't mind winter, but I will say that like people who live there, have a real aversion to what they call, I guess, bad weather, although I think they have some bad weather in certain parts of the year, but anything cold, anything like under certain temperature? Yeah, they want to be able to not have to turn their heat on.

So I guess it's yeah, just a certain part of the population is looking for that sunny beach lifestyle, which I kind of get but yeah.

Kathleen: Yeah, I don't know. It just it really struck me. I mean, in a way it's nice, but at the same time, I just thought, what is it with Floridians? Sorry, I feel like I can say that because I used to live there.

Neil: You used to live there. You didn’t like it there then?

Kathleen: Well, I have, like Northern European skin and very frizzy hair. It was a nightmare going through puberty in Florida.

Charli: So you have to move over the other side of the world.

Kathleen: There's a longer story to happen. No, at that age it was not my decision when and where to move.

Charli: This is a good time to ask for follow up questions episode. Kathleen's puberty journey.

Neil: So, you know, having done this series now and just on a final note with with hindsight, with all the facts you've accumulated, all the knowledge you've gained and also all the things that we just talked about that didn't make it into the series, I mean, what would you say, is the main element that gives you hope that we can actually turn this all around because a lot of the indicators suggest we're still going in the wrong direction.

Charli: Yeah. I definitely have mixed feelings at the end of it, because I think as we explore, there's a lot of devastation that's already occurred and that's underway and a lot more of it is locked in because of the climate change that's locked in because of the emissions that we've already released.

But doing the series as well highlighted that it's clear we're not out of ideas for solutions. There are plenty of solutions out there, a lot of the the main ones we need we already have and I'm pretty confident we'll come up with more and I'm also, always, hopeful speaking to people who are devoting their lives to, to working on this, to working on change.

Sam: I think you might be more hopeful than I am, but I will say this series and why I find reporting on climate so interesting is because it's such a multi-faceted, super complex topic. I mean, it's just got so many elements going on and for me this added kind of a whole new world of the economic elements to it.

But from that perspective, it's just a giant puzzle that we have to figure out, but I also I guess what gives me hope is, you know, we are to our knowledge kind of the most intelligent creature that's ever been on this planet. And we made this problem. So, we should be smart enough to figure it out.

Again, I don't know that I'm totally hopeful that we'll do so, but.

Charli: I didn't say we I didn't say we would, but we could.

Sam: Yeah, but I think one take away from me was also just thinking about those different possible futures, the heat episode and thinking about, you know, my own life down the road and being an older person dealing with heat and where do I want to live and do I need to think about that and how will our cities be built in the future, yeah, is something that definitely stayed with me after the series.

Charli: Did anything give you two hope?

Kathleen: Well actually I I tend to agree with you. I mean, I think hearing from people who are working on solutions who have a great deal of expertise and a lot of passion that goes into that work, it does make me feel more hopeful because it's a huge reminder that there are people out there who they do know what they're doing. They're creative, they're innovative and it is very much a matter of political will [mispronounces]. Will , sorry from the South. It is very much a matter of political will and, I think also talking about it, it's something I feel like comes up a lot in our reporting, the more you talk to people and also take the time to talk with basically anybody you can about these subjects, it's noticeable that most people aren't completely apathetic it could just be a situation where they don't think that it affects their lives, but I think once you start engaging in these topics more and more comes out and to me, that's what makes me feel more optimistic. And yeah, and hearing from these people who do have solutions.

Sam: Actually coming off of that political will is something I've also been thinking a lot about after this and, unfortunately, I think that's what makes me not so hopeful is, at least in most countries, that political will is still not there.

But actually reporting on this series and talking about economics, just to kind of bring it back to the core of the series is something people do really think about and do vote on and I think, if we can frame these issues not as, you should make this change in your life or you should you know, support this government, yeah, position just to sacrifice, like.

No, you should do this because it's in your economic interest and it's in like your long term economic interest and your short-term depending on you know your situation and where you live so I think, that needs to be integrated actually into more climate reporting.

Kathleen: Yeah, but I think it's, it's already getting that way for some voters because, you know, when you experience these disasters repeatedly, you can't explain away every single thing. And in terms of political will, I would disagree in terms of the voter base, because you could talk about national level politics in many countries and there's seeming to be a lack of political will.

But I think what we saw happen over just the course of a short period of time with Friday for Future actually a lot of people care a lot and you can change people's minds. I think much faster than than we sometimes admit, but, but then the question is holding people's attention and also when they're having to deal with so many problems at the same time, I think we're all dealing with a certain level of overwhelm and and being aware of that, but yeah, the political will is tricky also because like Green Party, politics can become messy if the party itself doesn't work. But the concept is something that the voters want. But I see that a little more optimistically that I know what you mean, but.

Neil: The one thing I find really comforting about the whole thing, and I totally get it with the political issue being the main problem, and something that is really worrying, but I find a lot of comfort in maths.

And the figures that you have there, you know, if the maths were stacked against us, then I would be depressed. Then I would really think, OK, but we haven't got a chance in hell to sort this out.

But I think we do. And you had some really good examples there where, for instance, if we were to shift on the subsidies, what are we subsidizing? Take the things that are harmful, that are being subsidized and use that for a clean energy transition.

I just have to look at my notes because you had a very striking figure here and it was based on the International Monetary Fund reports. And it found that $7 trillion of fossil fuel subsidies in 2022 alone were paid. And that is more than enough to cover the roughly 2 to 4 trillion per year that we would need to transition our energy system.

That's huge. That's fantastic news. Yeah. The only thing that's missing is the political will to make that happen. But the maths I find, that's what I took away. I drew hope from that.

Sam: Yeah. And people just realizing that, you know, the political will is only going to come if people are aware of that in the first place.

Charli: Yeah. And I think that's part of what we wanted to do with this series and want to continue to do is to draw this link between climate change and the cost of living. Why are things expensive? Why does this cost me more?

Kathleen: Well, great job and yeah, we look forward to more of this in the future.

Neil: Well, I would just say whoever hasn't listened to the series yet. Go back episode one in our podcast Feed, Apple Podcast, Spotify wherever you get them and yeah, go through the whole series. Listen to it back to back.

The version introduced on June 28, 2025, in the Senate would have required solar and wind projects to begin construction before the date of enactment, or they would be subject to a placed-in-service date of Dec. 31, 2027. Wind and solar projects beginning construction after June 16, 2025, would have been subject to the material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity requirements, as described below, and wind and solar projects that did not qualify for a credit or meet such requirements would have been subject to an excise tax.

Thanks to a last-minute deal from Sen. Murkowski of Alaska, the July 1, 2025, version of the bill passed by the Senate contained the same placed-in-service deadline for solar and wind projects, but only to the extent that they do not begin construction for tax purposes prior to 12 months after the date of enactment. This key provision allows solar and wind developers to safe harbor projects in 2025 and 2026 that will be placed in service in 2028, 2029 and 2030.

Additionally, the final bill adds no new limits on transferability, other than that credits cannot be transferred to prohibited foreign entities.

While the final version of the bill suggests that projects with planned placed-in-service dates in 2028, 2029 and 2030 can be safe harbored until 12 months after the President’s signature, clients should still consider beginning construction for projects with placed-in-service dates of 2028 or 2029 as soon as possible, since forthcoming IRS guidance that could affect the beginning of construction regime or related continuity safe harbor is possible.

McGuireWoods’ client alerts on the original version of the bill and the version passed by the House are available here and here.

A table summarizing the treatment of various credits under the final bill is below.

Beginning Construction

Despite favorable rules in the bill, McGuireWoods suggests that developers consider beginning construction on projects with a placed-in-service date of 2028 or 2029 as soon as possible.

Generally, the IRS recognizes two tests for a project to begin construction for tax purposes, the physical work test and the 5% safe harbor. Only one test must be satisfied to establish the beginning of construction. Once construction has begun, a taxpayer must make continuous efforts towards completion. Under a continuity safe harbor endorsed by the IRS, projects that begin construction in 2025 would have until the end of 2029 to be placed in service, and projects that begin construction in 2026 would have until the end of 2030 to be placed in service.

Under the physical work test, a taxpayer must perform physical work of a substantial nature on equipment that is an integral part of the facility. Off-site work must be performed pursuant to a binding written contract on components not normally held in the supplier’s inventory of the supplier that are critical to the project’s production of energy. For on-site work, work such as foundations uniquely designed to support electricity-generating equipment or other physical work of a substantial nature can establish the beginning of construction.

Under the 5% safe harbor, a taxpayer must, pursuant to a binding written contract, pay or incur at least 5% of the total cost of the facility and, for accrual-based taxpayers, take delivery of such components or expect to take delivery within 3.5 months of the execution of the binding written contract.

FEOC Rules

The bill would adopt a regime designed to stop credits claimed under 45Y, 48E, 45X, 45Q, 45Z and 45U from being claimed by or sold to certain prohibited foreign entities. For Section 45Y, 48E and 45X, this applies for credit claimed beginning Jan. 1, 2026. Additionally, (i) for Section 45Q, it applies beginning Jan. 1, 2026, and (ii) for Section 45Z and 45U, it applies beginning Jan. 1, 2026, in each case by determining if an entity is a prohibited foreign entity without regards to (b) and (c) under “foreign-influenced entity,” below.

Prohibited Foreign Entity: A specified foreign entity or a foreign-influenced entity.

Specified Foreign Entity: Foreign entities of concern, as described in the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act of FY 2021, include Chinese military companies operating in the United States, any entity on a list required by the strategy to enforce prohibition on imported goods made through forced labor in the Xinjiang Uyghur autonomous region, an entity listed as ineligible for Department of Defense battery acquisition in the National Defense Authorization Act of FY 2024 or a foreign-controlled entity.

Foreign-Controlled Entity: Foreign-controlled entities include the government of a covered nation (the Democratic People’s Republic of North Korea, the Republic of China, the Russian Federation and the Islamic Republic of Iran); a person who is a citizen, national or resident of a covered nation, provided the person is not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident; an entity or qualified business unit incorporated or organized under the laws of or having its principal place of business in a covered nation; or an entity controlled by any of the listed foreign-controlled entities.

Foreign-Influenced Entity: Foreign-influenced entities are entities:

with respect to which, during the taxable year, (a) a specified foreign entity has the direct or indirect authority to appoint a covered officer, (b) a single specified foreign entity owns at least 25% of such entity, (c) one or more specified foreign entities own in the aggregate at least 40% of such entity, or (d) at least 40% of the debt of such entity is held in the aggregate by one or more specified foreign entities;

which, during the previous taxable year, made a payment to a specified foreign entity pursuant to a contract, agreement or other arrangement which entitles such specified foreign entity to exercise control over a qualified facility or energy storage technology, including (a) determining the timing or production of electricity or an eligible component, (b) determining which entity may purchase or use the output of a project, (c) restrict access to data critical to the production of storage or energy or (d) repair or maintain the facility or energy storage technology on an exclusive basis; or

which is party to a licensing agreement with a specified foreign entity that entitles such specified foreign entity to exercise effective control over a qualified facility or energy storage technology or is longer than 10 years.

Material Assistance From a Prohibited Foreign Entity: Material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity is determined with respect to the “material cost ratio” of a qualified facility, energy storage technology or product line that produces eligible components. Generally, the material cost ratio for Sections 48E and 45Y is the portion of the cost of manufactured products, for 45X, is the cost of materials used to produce an eligible component, which come from sources other than prohibited foreign entities. The bill requires the IRS to issue safe harbor tables with respect to the cost of manufactured products and materials by Dec. 31, 2026, and states that until then, taxpayers may use the existing tables in IRS Notice 2025-08 to determine the cost of manufactured products and materials.

Additionally, the bill introduces new certification rules, but until the IRS issues guidance on these, taxpayers may rely on certifications from manufacturers or suppliers regarding the material cost ratio, provided that they do not rely on certifications they have reason to know are false. Existing contracts are exempt from the material assistance rules, provided that they were entered into prior to June 16, 2025, and relate to property that will be placed in service prior to Jan. 1, 2030.

A table summarizing the material cost ratios applicable under Sections 45Y, 48E and 45X is below:

Changes to Depreciation

The bill would eliminate (a) 5-year Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System depreciation for solar projects that do not qualify for a credit under Sections 48E or 45Y and (b) the energy-efficient commercial building deduction under Section 179D for projects beginning construction after June 30, 2026. Solar projects may still be able to utilize 100% bonus depreciation under Section 168(k).

Master Limited Partnerships

The bill would cause hydrogen storage, carbon capture, advanced nuclear, hydro-power and geothermal activities to constitute “qualifying income” under the master limited partnership tax regime. This provision creates an interesting regime that could pass tax credits through to master limited partnership investors and provide a method of raising capital for capital-intensive technologies. Additionally, this provision appears to be a boost to the oil and gas industry, which already uses the master limited partnership structure and could benefit from the inclusion of Section 45Q.",https://www.mcguirewoods.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/MW-social-media-icon.jpg,N,,2025-07-04 13:20:29.039770

Associated Press

House Republicans lifted President Donald Trump’s $4.5 trillion tax breaks and spending cuts bill to final passage Thursday, overcoming multiple setbacks to approve his signature second-term policy package before a self-imposed Fourth of July deadline.

The tight roll call, 218-214, came at a potentially high political cost, with two Republicans joining all Democrats opposed. GOP leaders worked overnight and the president himself leaned on a handful of skeptics to drop their opposition and send the bill to his desk to become law.

The passage of the 800-plus page “big beautiful bill” will likely become a defining milestone of Trump’s return to the White House, and it’s indicative of the power the right wields in this majority-Republican Congress.

Here's the latest:

Trump is close to arriving in Iowa as Air Force One is seen in the distance

The president’s plane was seen high in the sky near the fairgrounds during a break in the pre-program for the kick-off party for America's 250th anniversary.

Some attendees stood to watch and wave at the aircraft, anticipating a fly-by as the plane gets closer to landing.

As a candidate, Trump also looped his private jet above the 2023 Iowa State Fair before giving remarks at a beer hall in the fairgrounds.

MAGA faithful cheer Trump for pausing Ukraine weapons

Trump is getting praise from his most ardent supporters for withholding some weapons from Ukraine after they recently questioned his commitment to keeping the U.S. out of foreign conflicts.

The Pentagon pause on weapon deliveries to Ukraine comes just a few weeks after Trump ordered the U.S. military to carry out strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities.

Bombing the sites had some “Make America Great Again” supporters openly questioning whether Trump was betraying his vow to keep America out of “stupid wars.” But with the Ukraine equipment pause, Trump has sent the message that he remains committed to following through on his campaign pledge of ending that conflict.

Iowa launch for America’s 250th anniversary is intended to bring people together, organizer says

U.S. Ambassador Monica Crowley, Trump’s liaison to the organizing group for the 250th anniversary of American independence, said Iowa’s middle-of-the-country geography for the kickoff party is symbolic of the desire to use the coming celebrations to help bring people together.

Elijah Martin, 19, drove with his grandpa to the event in Des Moines from Cedar Rapids. He cast his first presidential vote for Trump, whom he called “probably the greatest president of the 21st century.” He acknowledged the deep divides in the nation but said he thinks Trump is bringing people together with more people recognizing his impact every day.

“Walk outside, look at the beautiful country we live in,” Martin said. “I just think a more positive attitude towards the world would really help.”

Iowa event where Trump will speak resembles a mini state fair

The section of the Iowa State Fairgrounds where Trump will speak is filling up several hours before he’s expected to arrive.

Volunteers are handing out ice-cold bottles of water in the 93-degree F (33.9 C) heat.

Vendors are selling everything from burgers and corn dogs to ice cream and cheese curds.

Trump talks pause on weapons for Ukraine

Before boarding Air Force One to fly to Iowa, Trump made his first public comments about his administration pausing weapons transfers to Ukraine.

“We’ve given so many weapons,” he said. “We are working with them and trying to help them.”

But he suggested that his predecessor provided too much.

“Biden emptied out our whole country giving them weapons, and we have to make sure that we have enough for ourselves,” he said.

Trump says he ‘didn’t make any progress’ with Putin during call

Trump said he and Russian President Vladimir Putin talked about Iran and the war in Ukraine during “a pretty long call” Thursday morning. He said he didn’t make any progress on a deal to end the fighting in Ukraine.

“I’m not happy about that,” Trump said. “I didn’t make any progress with him today at all.”

Top American general for the Middle East visited the US air base attacked by Iranian missiles

Gen. Erik Kurilla stopped at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar during a four-day Middle East tour to visit the service members who were involved in manning Patriot missile batteries to defend the base.

Al Udeid was targeted in late June by more than a dozen Iranian ballistic missiles after the U.S. launched a secret mission involving B-2 stealth bombers to target Iran’s nuclear enrichment facilities.

The general’s multi-country tour included visits to Israel, Jordan and Saudi Arabia, where met with Yemeni military officials. He also met with the crew of the guided missile destroyer USS Oscar Austin.

North Carolina governor says GOP Legislature must work to preserve Medicaid expansion

North Carolina Democratic Gov. Josh Stein says it’ll be up to the Republican-led Legislature to act to ensure Medicaid expansion and food stamps are preserved in the ninth-largest state now that Trump’s bill has received final congressional approval.

Stein called the bill a “disgrace” that will “have devastating consequences for the people and economy in North Carolina,” including those who rely on the health services that Medicaid provides and on food assistance.

“The General Assembly must step up to protect our bipartisan Medicaid expansion law and food assistance through SNAP,” Stein said.

GOP advocate for clean energy hails vote for tax bill

Rep. Andrew Garbarino, a New York Republican who had pushed to preserve clean energy tax credits, said he was proud to vote for the GOP tax bill, saying it will “keep critical energy projects moving forward” and help ensure American families and businesses have reliable access to power without the threat of blackouts.

Garbarino was one of 13 House Republicans who urged the Senate to preserve credits for wind and solar power that instead will be quickly phased out under the GOP law.

“We didn’t get everything we wanted, but we got what we needed to make progress, and there will be more legislation to come that builds on these victories and addresses the remaining challenges,’' Garbarino said in a statement.

He was especially pleased the bill will raise a cap on state and local tax deductions, a provision that lawmakers in New York and other high-tax states had fought for.

AOC: ’One of the saddest days in modern American history

The New York Democrat told reporters after the vote that “people are going to go hungry, people are going to get sick on a scale unlike anything we’ve ever seen. And all of it is just to finance tax cuts for billionaires and the wealthiest corporations who don’t need it.”

Ocasio-Cortez echoed Jeffries’ speech in urging a change in 2026.

“There has to be consequences to these votes,” she said. “We have to decide if this is just for TV, or just a joke, or our real lives. And I hope people vote like it’s our real lives.”

GOP lawmakers praise Trump and celebrate passage of landmark Republican budget package

The atmosphere was joyous and musical at a ceremony for the passage of Republicans’ signature tax and spending bill.

“I believe in America,” said House Speaker Mike Johnson, becoming briefly emotional as his colleagues cheered for him just ahead of the bill signing.

“Everything was an absolute disaster under the Biden-Harris radical, woke, progressive, Democrat regime,” Johnson said, adding that Republicans “had to quite literally fix every area of public policy.”

Republican leadership praised Trump in their remarks, noting that the bill codified into law much of his agenda.

“Without his leadership, none of this would have been possible,” said Rep. Lisa McClain, the GOP conference chair. “But today, we passed actual transformational legislation, legislation that will impact every family tomorrow.”

Johnson took selfies with lawmakers just before he signed the bill. Lawmakers all posed around the House speaker with their thumbs up as Johnson signed it, mimicking Trump’s signature poses. Half a dozen lawmakers also danced with their fists — Trump’s trademark dance move — as “Y.M.C.A” broke out in the room after Johnson penned his signature.

Massie says Trump’s bill ‘wasn’t beautiful enough’

Rep. Thomas Massie, one of two Republicans who voted against the bill, explained his decision in one sentence.

“Well, it looks like the big bill is going to pass but it wasn’t beautiful enough for me to vote for it,” Massey told reporters as he left the Capitol on Thursday.

The Kentucky Republican has been a fierce critic of the bill from the right, complaining it doesn’t rein in the budget deficit. Trump and his allies are mobilizing to challenge him in next year’s primary.

Trump to sign bill Friday evening

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that Trump plans to sign his big tax breaks and spending cuts bill at 5 p.m. Friday.

The Fourth of July signing ceremony will come as the White House is scheduled to hold a picnic to mark the holiday.

National Latino organizations condemn passage of tax and spending cut bill

Leaders from national Latino organizations warn that the passage of Trump’s big bill will harm many working families, especially those in the Latino community.

“This bill sends one message loud and clear — if you are Latino, working-class, or undocumented, you are not welcome here,” said Juan Proaño, Chief Executive Officer of LULAC in a statement. “It guts our nation’s moral fabric by placing walls, weapons, and fines where there should be help, hope, and humanity.”

Unidos US President and CEO Janet Murguía said in a statement the U.S. House of Representatives turned their back on the American people.

“Members of Congress who passed this bill have once again betrayed the trust of their constituents — including the Latino community — and chosen cruelty over common sense. All to supercharge a cruel and ineffective deportation machine that is sowing chaos across our nation.”

Voto Latino president and co-founder says bill reflects congressional Republican priorities

Voto Latino president and co-founder Maria Teresa Kumar called the bill a “disgraceful reflection of where congressional Republican priorities stand.""

“While hardworking families across the country face economic uncertainty given how expensive everything has become under the Trump administration, Republicans are stripping health care from millions through Medicaid cuts and slashing essential services to fund tax breaks for billionaires and hand over $45 billion to build for-profit detention centers,” Kumar said.

Kumar estimated that Medicaid cuts alone would impact about 26.8 million Latinos who depend on the programs.

Union condemns passage of bill

Milton Jones, international president of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, said it was disappointing that Congress “passed this damaging, ugly bill that ignores the needs of working families and makes cuts that are not just cruel — they are economically reckless.”

“Both Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Medicaid do much more than help families make ends meet. These programs support union jobs in grocery stores, meatpacking plants, and health care facilities across the country,” Jones said in a statement, adding that “80 percent of SNAP dollars are spent at traditional grocery stores where our members work and feed their communities.”

Treasury secretary says bill passage sets stage for ‘coming Golden Age’

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in an emailed statement that the passage of Republicans’ mega tax bill “has set the stage for the coming Golden Age as we prepare to celebrate the 250th year of our great nation.”

Thanking President Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans, Bessent said the GOP wing has “passed the biggest legislative win for American workers and families.”

Democrats accuse Republicans of passing a bill that will rip health care and food assistance away from millions of working poor, seniors and veterans around the country.

The House gives final approval to Trump’s big tax bill and sends it to him to sign

House Republicans propelled Trump’s $4.5 trillion tax breaks and spending cuts bill to final congressional passage Thursday, overcoming multiple setbacks to approve his signature second-term policy package before a Fourth of July deadline.

The tight roll call, 218-214, came at a potentially high political cost, with two Republicans joining all Democrats opposed. GOP leaders worked overnight and the president himself leaned on a handful of skeptics to drop their opposition and send the bill to him to sign into law. Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York delayed voting by holding the floor for more than eight hours with a record-breaking speech against the bill.

“We have a big job to finish,” said House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. “With one big beautiful bill we are going to make this country stronger, safer and more prosperous than ever before.”

Johnson makes closing arguments for Trump bill

House Speaker Mike Johnson is making the GOP’s closing arguments as the chamber prepares to take up Trump’s tax and spending cut bill.

“For everyday Americans, this means real, positive change that they can feel,” Johnson said of the bill.

At another point, he asked colleagues: “Are you tired of winning yet?”

“No,” they roared back.

Jeffries concludes speech after 8 hours 44 minutes

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has concluded his record floor speech that including everything from highlighting everyday Americans to mocking Trump and promising to make his “Big Beautiful Bill” a centerpiece of the upcoming midterm elections.

Jeffries repeatedly assailed the measure as “an all-out assault” on the nation’s values, hardworking Americans, labor unions and “law abiding immigrant families.”

He reminded voters how Republicans disavowed Project 2025, the conservative policy tome that proved unpopular during the 2024 campaign, only to watch Trump and the GOP pursue many of its ideas.

Jeffries said voters have a chance to shift course.

“After Project 2025 comes Project 2026,” he said, prompting roars from his Democratic colleagues. Based on the current House roster, Democrats need a net gain of just three seats to reclaim control of the chamber for the final two years of Trump’s second presidency.

Jeffries quotes New Testament to explain Democrats’ opposition and slams Trump for hawking Bibles

— “I don’t know who I’m talking about, but if you sell the Bible, you should know the Bible.”

House rules generally don’t allow members to attack others by name. So Jeffries chose his words carefully. But he was clearly the “God Bless the USA” Bible that Trump hawked for $59.99 with singer Lee Greenwood.

— “Got some folks in this town, they go to church and they pray on Sunday. P-R-A-Y. And then they come to Congress and they prey, P-R-E-Y, on the American people. I’m not down with that kind of faith.”

Again, Jeffries called no names but was talking about religious conservatives backing the bill that Jeffries said flouts many biblical commands on helping others in need.

— Jeffries spent several minutes on Matthew 25, a Christian gospel chapter many Democrats commonly quote because it includes Jesus’ teachings on how to treat “the least of these.”

“For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat. I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink. I was a stranger and you invited me in ... ,” Jeffries said. “E pluribus unum. Out of many, one. I needed clothes, and you clothed me. I was sick, I had medical problems. ... I was in prison, and you came to visit me. ... That’s not what’s happening in this one big, ugly bill.”

Jeffries sets record for longest floor speech

House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries has surpassed the record for the longest floor speech as the chamber considers Trump’s tax and spending cut bill.

The stem-winder began at 4:53 a.m. EDT and has touched an array of subjects, including the reading of letters from Americans who rely on government programs such as Medicaid and SNAP.

Jeffries said the bill “steals” from those programs to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy.

The speech took on the air of a Sunday church service air as it extended into its eighth hour and he began citing passages from the Bible.

“Take your time,"" colleagues replied as he spoke. “Take your sweet time.”

“Shame on this institution if this bill passes,” he said.

Democrats are a ‘Hell No!’ on Trump’s bill, Jeffries says

If Jeffries’ long-form speech wasn’t enough to communicate the Democrats’ uniform opposition to Trump’s policy priorities, the House Speaker is summing it up in two words: “Hell No!”

More than eight hours into his opposing presentation, Jeffries said that despite the president’s rhetoric about helping Americans in their daily lives, “not a single thing in Donald Trump’s one big, ugly bill will meaningfully make life more affordable for everyday Americans.”

“We were a ‘Hell No!’ last week, a ‘Hell No!’ this week, a ‘Hell No!’ yesterday, a ‘Hell No!’ today, and we’ll continue to be a ‘Hell No!’ on this effort to hurt the American people,"" he said.

As his volume rose, Jeffries’ fellow Democrats joined his “Hell No!” refrain.

Putin and Trump talk Ukraine, Iran and other issues, Kremlin says

Regarding Iran, Putin emphasized during their Thursday call the need to resolve all issues by political and diplomatic means, said Yuri Ushakov, his foreign affairs adviser.

As for Ukraine, Ushakov said Trump emphasized his push for a quick cessation of hostilities, and Putin voiced Moscow’s readiness to pursue talks with Ukraine. At the same time, the Russian leader emphasized that Moscow will seek to achieve its goals in Ukraine and remove the “root causes” of the conflict, Ushakov said.

The Kremlin adviser said a suspension in U.S. military aid to Ukraine wasn’t discussed during the call.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy hopes to speak to Trump soon about weapons

The Ukrainian president says he hope to speak soon with Trump following a pause in some weapons shipments to the country seeking to fight off invading Russian forces.

Asked Thursday when he would find out more about the halt, Zelenskyy said, “I hope that maybe tomorrow, or close days, these days, I will speak about it with President Trump.”

Zelenskyy spoke to reporters in Aarhus, Denmark, after a meeting with major European Union backers.

Jeffries calls out Republicans who voted ‘yes’ then urged changes

House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries is calling out 13 House Republicans who supported Trump’s big tax bill in May but later sent a letter urging the Senate to scale back some of its clean energy cuts. He urged the Republicans who signed the clean energy letter to vote against the final bill.

He also criticized Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who voted for the bill Tuesday but said it “needs more work across chambers and is not ready for the president’s desk.”

Jeffries said he was “flummoxed” that GOP lawmakers would urge members of the other chamber to fix a bill they voted for.

“That is not how the people’s business should be done in the United States Congress,’' he said. “We have a responsibility to stand up for what is right in the chamber that we serve in.”

The Democrats lack the votes in Congress to stop Trump’s bill, so Jeffries’ speech is really about framing it — today and for the 2026 midterm elections — as “an all-out assault on the American people.”

“This is personal to us,” Jeffries said as he notes the Republican measure’s impact on Americans including veterans, the working class, small-business owners, employees trying to unionize, federal workers, Medicaid beneficiaries and customers in Affordable Care Act insurance exchanges.

That list spans typical Republican and Democratic coalitions.

Republicans hold 220 seats to Democrats’ 212, with three vacancies after recent deaths of Democratic members. So Democrats would need a net gain of just three seats to make Jeffries the potential House speaker in 2027.

House Democratic leader says what Republicans are doing is criminal

“I never thought that I’d be on the House floor saying that this is a crime scene,” Jeffries said. “It’s a crime scene, going after the health, and the safety, and the well-being of the American people.”

And as Democrats, he said, “We want no part of it.”

Jeffries seized a leader’s prerogative for unlimited debate early Thursday, and after speaking for more than five hours is still a few hours away from breaking the record for the longest House leader’s speech, set in 2021.

House Republicans, up all night, are ready to vote on Trump’s $4.5 trillion tax breaks and spending cuts bill as soon as he gives up the floor.

How a GOP rift doomed the bill’s ban on state AI laws

A bid to deter states from regulating artificial intelligence for a decade seemed on its way to passing as part of the Republican tax cut and spending bill, but was doomed by a relentless campaign by Republican governors, lawmakers, think tanks and social groups.

Activist Mike Davis urged right-wing podcaster Steve Bannon’s viewers to call their senators to reject this “AI amnesty” for “trillion-dollar Big Tech monopolists.” He said he texted with Trump directly, advising the president to stay neutral despite significant pressure from White House AI czar David Sacks, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and others.

The schism revealed the enormous influence of a segment of the Republican Party that has come to distrust Big Tech. They believe states must remain free to protect citizens against potential harms from AI, social media or emerging technologies.

Trump’s bill rolls back past presidential agendas

In many ways, the package is a repudiation of the agendas of the last two Democratic presidents, a chiseling away at the Medicaid expansion from Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act, and a pullback of Joe Biden’s climate change strategies in the Inflation Reduction Act.

Democrats have warned that lives will be lost due to the bill’s cuts to Medicaid, which some 80 million Americans rely on. Cutting food stamps that help feed more than 40 million people would “rip food from the mouths of hungry children, hungry veterans and hungry seniors,” Jeffries said.

Republicans say the tax breaks will prevent a tax hike on households and grow the economy. They maintain they are trying to rightsize the safety net programs for the population they were initially designed to serve, mainly pregnant women, the disabled and children, and root out what they describe as waste, fraud and abuse.

Small-business owners get a shoutout in Jeffries’ speech

The House Minority Leader is shifting from veterans to small-business owners, continuing to highlight groups of voters that Republicans often claim are theirs.

“Small business represents the heart and soul of the American economy,” Jeffries said, pointing to entrepreneurs who could see their insurance access compromised as the GOP bill adds bureaucratic barriers to health care.

“I have had your backs,” Jeffries says in the veteran’s voice. It’s time for the country “to cover my back.”

How Ukraine can cope with the US pause on crucial battlefield weapons

The pause on some weapons shipments to Ukraine has come at a tough time for Kyiv: Russia’s bigger army is making a concerted battlefront push and intensifying long-range drone and missile attacks against civilians in Ukrainian cities.

Washington has been Ukraine’s biggest military backer since Russia launched its full-scale invasion, but the Trump administration has been disengaging from the war and there’s no end to the fighting in sight despite recent direct peace talks.

Ukraine has raced to build up its domestic defense industry, producing increasingly sophisticated drones, and amid fraught relations with Trump, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has enlisted more European help in weapons manufacturing.

But some high-tech U.S. weapons are irreplaceable. Patriot air defense missiles are needed to fend off Russia’s frequent ballistic missile attacks, but cost $4 million each.

Massachusetts advocates say Trump’s bill unravels health safety net

In the state that served as the model for Obamacare, advocates and health care workers fear the Trump administration will dismantle piece-by-piece a popular program providing insurance, preventive care and lifesaving medication to hundreds of thousands of people.

Provisions contained in both the Senate and House versions of the massive tax and spending cuts bill could strip health insurance from up to a quarter of the roughly 400,000 people enrolled in the Massachusetts Health Connector, according to state estimates.

Trump and Republicans in Congress say new documentation requirements and limitations on who can apply for tax credits to help pay for insurance are necessary to root out fraud, waste and abuse.

Billions to fund the military within the US

The budget bill includes a hefty investment, some $350 billion, in national security and Trump’s deportation agenda and to help develop the “Golden Dome” defensive system over the U.S.

To help offset the costs of lost tax revenue, the package includes $1.2 trillion in cutbacks to the Medicaid health care and food stamps, largely by imposing new work requirements, including for some parents and older people, and a massive rollback of green energy investments.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the package will add $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the decade and 11.8 million more people will go without health coverage.

US employers add a surprising 147,000 jobs despite uncertainty

The American labor market continues to show surprising resilience despite uncertainty over Trump’s economic policies. The unemployment rate ticked down 4.1% from 4.2% in May, the Labor Department said Thursday.

Hiring rose modestly from a revised 144,000 in May and beat economists expectations of fewer than 118,000 new jobs as Trump’s trade wars, the federal hiring freeze and immigration crackdown weigh on the American job market. U.S. applications for jobless aid fell to 233,000 last week as layoffs remain low.

A survey released Wednesday by the payroll processor ADP found that private companies cut 33,000 jobs last month, reflecting a hesitancy to hire and a reluctance to replace departing workers.

The president’s deportations, meanwhile, are driving immigrants out of the U.S. labor force. Those working and looking for work fell by 625,000 in May, the biggest drop in a year and a half.

What's in the Big Beautiful Bill Act

At some 887 pages, the legislation includes tax breaks, spending cuts, a rollback of solar energy tax credits, new money for national defense and deportations. The bill does not eliminate taxes on Social Security benefits, despite what Trump says.

The bill rolls back past presidential agendas: In many ways, the package is a repudiation of the agendas of the last two Democratic presidents, a chiseling away at the Medicaid expansion from Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act, and a pullback of Joe Biden’s climate change strategies in the Inflation Reduction Act.

Congressional Budget Office review: The nonpartisan CBO said Sunday the bill would pile nearly $3.3 trillion onto the nation’s debt load from 2025 to 2034, a nearly $1 trillion increase over the House-passed version of the bill. The analysis also found that 11.8 million Americans would become uninsured by 2034 if the bill passed.

Hakeem Jeffries has been talking for three hours and counting

Republican leadership spent much of the night and early morning persuading a handful of holdouts to support the Senate-approved tax cuts and spending bill. But now, House Speaker Mike Johnson appears to have the votes, and Democrats are standing in the way.

As the House wrapped up its debate over passing Trump’s agenda, Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries used a tool known as the “magic minute” that allows leaders unlimited time to speak. He started his address just before 5 a.m. ET. And it’s still going.

“I’m going to take my time,” he said, before launching into a speech criticizing Republicans’ deference to Trump, reading through personal accounts of people concerned about losing their health care coverage, and recounting American history.

Eventually, Jeffries will end his speech, and Republicans will move to final passage of the bill.",https://APPREMIUM.images.worldnow.com/images/26627453_G.jpg?lastEditedDate=1751540534000,N,,2025-07-04 18:11:06.084511

Considering both the timing and Slate's previous mention of federal incentives, the Blank Slate's pricing change appears to be linked to Trump's controversial spending bill passing on Thursday afternoon. This bill eliminates a $7,500 tax credit the U.S. government granted to drivers who purchased a new EV, which had encouraged drivers to adopt cleaner, more environmentally friendly vehicles.

The tax break will now end on September 30, which will likely cause several EVs in the U.S. to jump in price. Even if drivers rush to buy an EV now while the tax credits are still available, they won't be able to get their hands on a Blank Slate. The automaker is only scheduled to begin delivery of its vehicles in late 2026, well after the U.S. government will stop offering the tax credit.

Slate's electric truck gained significant attention earlier this year, the start-up claiming that they'd received over 100,000 reservations within mere weeks of it being unveiled. This doesn't guarantee Slate has secured 100,000 sales, as a reservation is merely a $50 deposit in exchange for a place in the queue to buy a truck. Even so, those numbers do indicate some interest in the EV, particularly as drivers increasingly seek alternatives to Elon Musk's Tesla.

Whether such interest can be sustained in light of the Blank Slate's revised pricing remains to be seen. Whatever the case, the U.S. start-up's work just got much more difficult.

Conclusion: The EV Market's New Rules Favor Rivian The tax credit phase-out isn't just a policy shift—it's a market reset.","The U.S. electric vehicle (EV) market is undergoing a seismic shift as federal tax credits expire, reshaping the competitive landscape in favor of pure-play EV manufacturers like Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN) and Lucid (NASDAQ: LCID). Legacy automakers such as GM (NYSE: GM), Ford (NYSE: F), and Hyundai/Kia are losing critical subsidies just as demand surges ahead of the September 30, 2025, tax credit deadline. This creates a rare window for Rivian and Lucid to capitalize on reduced competition, though their paths to growth diverge sharply. Here's why investors should pay attention—and where to bet.

The Tax Credit Phase-Out: A Catalyst for Market Restructuring

The $7,500 federal EV tax credit—a cornerstone of U.S. EV adoption—expires at the end of 2025 for automakers that have sold over 200,000 vehicles. This includes giants like GM and Tesla, which have long surpassed the threshold. Meanwhile, Rivian and Lucid, with 139,000 and 21,000 cumulative U.S. sales respectively, remain eligible for the credit until 2026 under the House-passed ""Big Beautiful Bill"". This creates two critical advantages:

Lower Effective Pricing: Rivian and Lucid can offer vehicles at prices competitive with legacy automakers, even as their rivals face rising sticker prices without subsidies.

Reduced Competition: Traditional automakers are scaling back EV investments due to fading incentives and margin pressures, ceding market share to EV-dedicated firms.

Rivian: Production Muscle and Strategic Pricing

Rivian's strong production capacity and upcoming R2 SUV position it as the prime beneficiary of this shift.

R2 SUV: Priced at $49,000, the R2 targets mainstream buyers, undercutting Tesla's Model Y ($53,000) and legacy competitors. Analysts at BNP Paribas predict it could double Rivian's annual deliveries to ~120,000 units by 2026.

Q3 Demand Surge: As consumers rush to secure tax credits before the September deadline, Rivian's ability to ramp production matters. Despite missing Q2 2025 delivery targets by 2.3%, Rivian's Tennessee manufacturing plant is scaling to 150,000 annual units by 2026—a rate unmatched by Lucid.

Lucid: Potential, but Delays Loom Large

Lucid faces a tougher path. While its Air sedan and upcoming Gravity SUV (delayed to late 2025) offer luxury appeal, production bottlenecks and pricing constraints threaten growth.

Pricing Challenges: Lucid's Air starts at $93,000, far above the federal $80,000 SUV price cap for tax credit eligibility. This forces reliance on leasing loopholes, which may vanish post-2025.

Product Pipeline Lag: Lucid's midsize crossover, planned for 2027, arrives after Rivian's R2 and Tesla's Cybertruck, risking irrelevance in the affordable segment.

Investment Thesis: Buy Rivian, Cautious on Lucid

The third-quarter demand surge will be a make-or-break moment for both companies:

Rivian: Its R2 launch and $49,000 pricing align perfectly with post-subsidy affordability needs. Even if macroeconomic headwinds persist, Rivian's production scale and product timing make it a short-to-medium-term buy.

Lucid: While its tax credit eligibility until 2026 is a lifeline, delays and reliance on high-margin luxury models leave it exposed to rising competition from Tesla and Rivian. Investors should wait for clarity on production timelines and pricing strategy before committing.

Conclusion: The EV Market's New Rules Favor Rivian

The tax credit phase-out isn't just a policy shift—it's a market reset. Rivian's execution on the R2 and production scalability position it to dominate a shrinking field of competitors. Lucid, meanwhile, must prove it can overcome delays and pivot to affordability before losing its edge. For now, Rivian is the safer bet in a race to capture a $150 billion U.S. EV market by 2030.

Investment Recommendation:

- Rivian (RIVN): Buy at current levels (~$18–$20) with a 12-month price target of $28–$32, assuming R2 success.

- Lucid (LCID): Hold for now; revisit in early 2026 after Gravity deliveries and crossover plans materialize.

The EV landscape is changing—investors who back the right disruptors will profit handsomely.

Court documents show Eni has initiated legal proceedings against critics including the Italian public broadcaster Rai, Greenpeace and multiple newspapers.
In April, a coalition of NGOs including Reporters Without Borders and Transparency International awarded Eni the title of “Slapp addict of the year” for its defamation lawsuits.
Eni was eventually acquitted of criminal charges in the corruption trial, which was brought about by NGOs including ReCommon.
Climate activists and oil companies are increasingly turning to the courts as fights over pollution and public opinion have become more fraught.","When Antonio Tricarico was summoned to his local police station in October and told he was being investigated for defamation, he was stressed but not shocked. Months earlier, Tricarico, the director of the Italian environment NGO ReCommon, had filed a joint legal challenge against the country’s biggest oil company, Eni, which he knew had a history of using lawyers to clamp down on critics.

The company had previously limited itself to civil defamation lawsuits, including against ReCommon, but in Tricarico’s case it initiated criminal proceedings over statements he had made in a television interview.

“There is intimidation against myself, for sure, which is not nice and is impacting daily work,” said Tricarico, who is now considering the energy and resources that would be needed if the case goes to trial. “But I think the intimidation is broader.”

Environment groups say Eni is engaging in a campaign to stifle critics, with the company having filed at least six defamation lawsuits against journalists and NGOs since January 2019.

The publicly traded company, which is under the de facto control of the Italian economy ministry, is among the world’s biggest historical polluters in terms of planet-heating gas. It plans to increase its underlying production by 3-4% a year over the course of the decade, even as roadmaps to stop the planet from heating call for rapid declines in fossil fuel use.

Court documents show Eni has initiated legal proceedings against critics including the Italian public broadcaster Rai, Greenpeace and multiple newspapers. The company has sought more than €10m (£8.6m) in damages across the known cases, according to analysis shared exclusively with the Guardian by Aria, a non-profit research organisation. Eni’s latest lawsuit does not seek compensation.

Judges have ruled against Eni in three of the cases and another was resolved in a settlement agreement. Two more cases, including the criminal investigation into Tricarico and a civil case against Greenpeace and ReCommon, are continuing.

Simona Abbate, a climate and energy campaigner at Greenpeace Italy, said: “Eni is trying to silence dissent. It’s an international strategy that fossil companies use to limit the environmental movement.”

Campaigners say the cases are examples of “strategic lawsuits against public participation”, known as Slapps, which can bully journalists and watchdogs into silence with the threat of spurious legal action that stands little chance of success. Eni disputes the characterisation.

In April, a coalition of NGOs including Reporters Without Borders and Transparency International awarded Eni the title of “Slapp addict of the year” for its defamation lawsuits. The groups highlighted Eni’s 2024 case against Greenpeace and ReCommon after they sought to hold Eni accountable for climate damages.

The company is responsible for 0.46% of global emissions since the Industrial Revolution, according to figures from the Carbon Majors database that include emissions released by customers burning its fuels. Eni’s case against the NGOs seeks to stop them from characterising its actions as “crimes” or using similar language in campaigns.

A spokesperson for Eni said it “has not only the right but the duty to turn to the judicial authorities when faced with false and defamatory statements that damage its reputation”.

They said: “It is important to note that Eni has not initiated any Slapp suits against environmental groups, as it has not sought any financial compensation, but only the judicial truth to which it is entitled.”

In earlier defamation lawsuits that Eni lost, mostly concerning coverage of the acquisition of a Nigerian oilfield licence, the company had sought damages of €5m and €350,000 from the Italian newspaper Il Fatto Quotidiano and €5m from Rai. Eni was eventually acquitted of criminal charges in the corruption trial, which was brought about by NGOs including ReCommon.

Climate activists and oil companies are increasingly turning to the courts as fights over pollution and public opinion have become more fraught. While several oil and gas companies have been criticised by free speech campaigners for using legal threats to fight off critics, Eni has filed more lawsuits against journalists and environment groups than other European oil majors are known to have done.

Tricarico said there had been “a change of pace” since Eni’s attempts to claim damages from media organisations had failed, and it was now taking a more subtle approach by not asking for money.

“The company realised that probably this was not enough to stop the few critical voices – and actually was a pretty bad outcome in court,” he said. “My feeling is that they are moving to a different approach that you might call a ‘Slapp 2.0’.”",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/997b15b1d86e2c641191aac31c2aa701ccc7b5b0/96_0_3979_3184/master/3979.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3b358630ec5c153e83c87e3a4ab9672d,N,,2025-07-04 16:10:24.159378

Hydrogen is an emerging aspect of clean energy and tests are still ongoing to try to further develop it.","Critics have blasted the “Big, Beautiful Bill” for how it will negatively affect an emerging economy that’s centered around clean energy in Georgia.

The bill, a massive piece of legislation that largely implements President Donald Trump’s policy initiatives, was passed by Congress Thursday and is set to be signed by Trump. It is expected to cause difficulty for solar, battery and electric vehicle industries in Georgia by pulling back on tax credits that sought to fight climate change.

“This is a classic case of a self-inflicted wound,” said Zach Amittay Southeast advocate of E2, an environmental business, said. “It’s a bad deal for American households and it’s just bad policy.”

The bill is aimed at cutting the national deficit, and cutting the green energy incentives is estimated to save about half a trillion dollars, according to the New York Times. Trump and Republicans have said they want these cuts to “to further defeat inflation” saying that the Inflation Reduction Act, which created these green energy incentives, “sets us back.”

Electric boom or bust in Georgia

Georgia has been at the center of a clean energy transition since the tax incentives were created in 2022, attracting 45 clean energy projects across every corner of the state. This has brought $24 billion in private investment in just two years. A dozen of those projects, such as solar manufacturers and battery plants, are in rural parts of the state, marking the highest rate in the nation.

Across the country, 96% of all new energy projects were carbon-free in 2024.

“The renewable energy sector, solar manufacturing, battery production, electric vehicle manufacturing that are core to Georgia’s economic development right now are now being destroyed,” Sen. Jon Ossoff said in a press conference on Wednesday. “Georgia has made out better than just about any other state in the country. This bill is a direct attack on the industry that is driving Georgia’s economic development, job creation and wealth creation in our state right now.”

An advanced manufacturing tax credit for green energy growth in the Inflation Reduction Act aided several solar companies in Georgia: Sunviva in Norcross, QCells in Dalton and NanoPV in Andersonville. Electric vehicle battery companies such as Hyundai near Savannah, SK batteries in Commerce, or Ascend Elements in Covington are also associated with the manufacturing tax credit.

The new law shrinks the timeline for advanced manufacturing projects such as QCells – the largest solar panel manufacturing plant in North America – in Dalton. Those projects can only claim tax credits at 100% until 2031, which cuts the benefits off a year earlier than the previous law.

Despite just a one-year change, critics argue that the incentives that helped electrify the economy around the country and the state will change because other cuts in the Trump-backed bill will reduce demand for green energy initiatives. Other cuts include the $7,500 new electric vehicle tax credit, the $4,000 used EV tax credit, and the commercial EVs tax credit. Those credits expire in 90 days, on Sept. 30, rather than remaining in place for seven years as they did under prior law.

“These laws were designed as an ecosystem of support,” said Terin Mayer, deputy director of research for BlueGreen Alliance. “The production tax credit for wind and solar is going to significantly affect the economics of building a solar or battery manufacturing location. The pieces that are going to be most impactful here is demand for the products that these manufacturers are producing.”

QCells is “very important” to Dalton, said Carl Campbell, executive director of Dalton-Whitfield Joint Development Authority. The company brought 2,000 jobs to the area in 2018. Campbell sent a letter to Sen. John Thune last week before the Senate voted on the house bill asking him to do everything in his power to protect the full strengths of the tax credits that helped the company thrive.

“They are dumping $125 million a year in annual payroll in our community,” Campbell said. “We hope they will adapt and change if necessary and continue to provide good jobs and products in our community.”

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, whose district includes Dalton, is less optimistic about the clean energy economy and called these incentives the “green new scam.” She previously told the Ledger-Enquirer that businesses shouldn’t have to rely on the government if they are a sustainable business. Greene voted in favor of the bill.

But Brion Fitzpatrick, president of the Georgia Solar Energy Industries Association, said any major source of industry such as nuclear, coal, gas or hydropower has been stimulated by federal incentives.

“All major businesses are reliant on government incentives,” he said. “It doesn’t matter if you’re talking about a Georgia-based airline or a car manufacturer, or a nuclear power plant. They are all reliant on government incentives.

“And, since we’ve been getting incentives, we’ve driven down the cost of the manufacturing of solar modules, the development and construction of solar projects, and the overall deployment of solar.”

Fitzpatrick worries about what will happen to QCells and the solar jobs in the state.

“On a nationwide scale and companies like QCells, and some of these other companies, they’re going to lower their capacity and lower their jobs,” he said. “So instead of growing they’re going to start redacting how many modules they’re producing.”

There were 82,000 people working in the solar industry in Georgia in 2024, according to the Georgia Chamber of Commerce.

“Solar companies in Georgia will face job cuts because there will be virtually no projects to be developed,” Fitzpatricl said. “I’m talking rooftop (solar), not just your generation and utility scale. This is an annihilation of our industry.”

Solar developer Brightnight was poised to open a 400 megawatt solar site called Pepper and Hammock in Wayne and Brantley counties in southeast Georgia. They have a battery and storage project that hasn’t yet been announced, which altogether would add 2,500 MW of electricity to the Georgia grid.

The company has not responded to requests for comment about whether they will carry on with the projects after this new law was passed Thursday.

Terin said facilities that have announced but aren’t operating yet are more likely to pull the plug due to this legislation. But if there’s a huge cut in demand for battery factories, they’ll “fold as well.”

Sen. Raphael Warnock, a Georgia Democrat, voted against the bill alongside his Democratic colleague Ossoff on Wednesday.

“We should not be sacrificing Georgia jobs for tax cuts for folks who are already well off, but we are seeing political games about to derail a generational economic transformation that is already putting people to work and creating economic opportunity,” Warnock said in an email to the Ledger-Enquirer.

Cuts to at-home clean energy credits

The “Big, Beautiful Bill” also sets an early expiration for home improvement and residential clean energy tax credits, which now will go away on Dec. 30.

These credits were aimed at lowering the cost of installing a new HVAC system or electrifying a stovetop in homes, changes which run in the thousands of dollars. Outdated versions of these products make bills more expensive and take more demand from the energy grid.

Georgians who retrofitted households by adding new HVAC, insulation or adding solar panels were given a 30% tax credit. In 2023, 82,000 Georgians made the switch and received tax credits, saving $148 million, according to the Department of the Treasury. Numbers for 2024 have not yet been released.

Contractors and installers have seen the upswell in home electrification tally to 3,000 jobs in Georgia.

Zach Pierce, head of policy at Rewiring America, a national electrification nonprofit, says this is the wrong time to be making it hard for people to make upgrades because of energy needs.

“This is a momentous time in our energy industry, our load growth (is) increasing faster than any time since World War II,” he said. “We’re seeing utilities grapple with that new load growth at the same time as they’re having to replace aging infrastructure and power plants that are retiring as our grid gets older. And all of that is happening in a moment where including our energy infrastructure is being exposed to more severe and frequent extreme weather.”

Pierce said the bill picks winners and losers.

“In this moment we should be utilizing every tool that we have in the toolbox to contain costs for customers and to build a resilient and affordable energy system that’s fit for the 21st century. But what this bill does is it picks winners and losers.”

Will Georgia electric bills go up?

“(This is) economic malpractice,” Ammitay of E2 said. “We’re in a moment where there’s a surge in energy demand, the energy load is increasing year-over-year due to things like the growth of the artificial intelligence industry, you know, data centers, advanced manufacturing, population growth in places, you know, in communities across Georgia. So, we need power kind of wherever we can get it and solar is the fastest and cheapest source to deploy.”

Energy experts such as Ammitay argue that phasing out incentives will cause massive implications for efforts to keep utility costs low.

“Without adding sufficient solar and wind capacity to meet growing electricity demand from data centers and other sources, there will be increased pressure on fossil fuels to increase supply and meet that demand, consequently resulting in higher electricity prices,” Akshay Thyagarajan, policy analyst for the Center for American Progress, said in an email.

The Center for American Progress and Clean Energy Buyers Association predict that Georgia will see an increase of $102 in their annual electric cost by 2026 due to the repeal of these credits.

“The tech revolution and America’s ability to lead the AI race is dependent on energy, and we’re currently at an energy deficit,” Fitzpatrick said. “So why would you take away the fastest thing to deploy and the cheapest energy to deploy in a time where we’re already at an energy deficit? It makes no sense.”

Not all clean energy credits were rescinded

The tax credit for using hydrogen energy had its window shortened to 2027. It previously was eligible for credits until 2032. Hydrogen is an emerging aspect of clean energy and tests are still ongoing to try to further develop it.

Hydrogen, while just emerging in parts of the clean energy economy, with new tests being developed in power generation just last month also had its window shortened to 2027 rather than 2032 per the 45V tax credit.

The tax credit for nuclear power has been left alone, and will remain incentivized until 2032.

""These [tax credits] are coming to an end much sooner than our industry was anticipating,"" O'Grady said.","The massive tax and spending package that is on its way to President Trump's desk for signature could mean higher electricity bills in Minnesota, according to one analysis looking at the impacts of the proposal.

The so-called ""big, beautiful bill"" ends tax credits for wind and solar production and other clean energy-related incentives that were part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, including those that help offset the costs of residential solar installation and other energy efficiency programs.

Those changes could increase Minnesotans' home electricity costs by 28% and industrial electricity costs by 46%, according to an analysis by think tank Energy Innovation. It will cost ratepayers $2.7 billion by 2034, the report said.

Annie Levenson-Falk, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board, is sounding the alarm about those estimates, which she said come at a time when Minnesotans are already struggling to afford the high cost of energy.

As of the end of March, Minnesota households owed a combined total of about $150 million in past due utility bills, she said.

""It's inflation throughout the family budget, and all of that is mounting pressure. It's not just energy in a vacuum, but just within energy, a lot of people are also facing the potential for rate hikes,"" Levenson-Falk said. ""Xcel Energy is in for a rate increase right now. That's before state regulators, where they're asking for a 13% increase in rates as of next year. We need to be doing everything we can right now to bring energy costs down, and this bill is a big step in the opposite direction.""

The package provides a boost for the fossil fuel industry, allowing offshore oil and gas leases and in Alaska. Supporters of the measure say that the change will make the U.S. more energy independent.

""This is a once-in-a-generation piece of legislation that secures our border, unleashes American energy, allows families to keep more of their hard-earned taxpayer dollars in their pockets, cuts waste fraud and abuse in government programs ... all while implementing the largest cut in mandatory spending in our history,"" said Republican U.S. Rep. Tom Emmer, the majority whip who represents Minnesota's Sixth District.

Logan O'Grady, executive director of the Minnesota Solar Energy Industries Association, said the rollbacks of clean energy tax credits are a big hit to his industry that's still relatively new to Minnesota.

""If you look at any load projections for demand on our energy grid, they're skyrocketing with data centers and the emergence of AI,"" O'Grady said. ""So at a time when we're having more energy demand on the grid, we just got rid of a bunch of options to quickly deploy the energy production to meet that. It doesn't make any sense.""

Many of those credits were initially available until 2032. The final tax package will shorten the timeline and limit them to projects that begin construction in 2026 before they're phased out, which O'Grady called an improvement over an earlier version.

The Senate also stripped out a provision that would have levied an excise tax on wind and solar energy projects that use a certain amount of material sourced from other countries, like China.

The US House of Representatives voted 218 to 214 on Thursday to pass President Trump’s sweeping domestic policy bill, greenlighting deep cuts to America’s social safety net and the decimation of the country’s only federal climate strategy. Democrats uniformly opposed the bill, while all but two House Republicans supported it.

“This bill will leave America a far crueler and weaker place,” said Robert Weissman, co-president of the nonprofit Public Citizen, in a statement. It “races the United States and the world toward climate catastrophe, ending support for renewable energy that is absolutely vital to avert worst-case climate scenarios.”

The “One Big Beautiful Bill” has now been approved by both chambers of Congress; all it needs now is Trump’s signature before it can become law. Trump is expected to sign it during an evening ceremony on July 4, Independence Day, according to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt.

One of Republicans’ biggest victories in the bill is the extension of deep tax cuts enacted during Trump’s first term, which are estimated to cost the country more than $4 trillion over 10 years. The legislation also directs roughly $325 billion to the military and to border security, while cutting more than $1 trillion in funding for Medicaid, the joint state and federal program that covers medical costs for lower-income and disabled Americans.

To pay for the tax breaks, the bill sunsets clean energy tax credits that were put in place by the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), making wind and solar projects ineligible unless they start construction before July 2026 or are placed in service by 2027. It also imposes an expedited phaseout of consumer tax credits for new and used electric vehicles—by September 30 this year instead of by 2032. Green groups described the legislation as “historically ruinous” and “a self-inflicted tragedy for our country.”

The IRA’s tax credits and additional incentives for green energy from the bipartisan infrastructure act, also passed under former president Joe Biden, were projected to reduce the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions by 42 percent by 2030. Combined with additional action from states, cities, and private companies, they could have put the US on track to meet the country’s emissions reduction target under the UN’s Paris Agreement.

Once Trump signs the megabill, however, the US will have no federal plan to address the climate crisis. “Every lawmaker who voted for this cynical measure chose tax cuts for the wealthiest over Americans’ health, pocketbooks, public lands, and waters—and a safe climate. They should be ashamed,” said Manish Bapna, president of the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council, in a statement.

Agriculture experts have also objected to Trump’s policy bill, which removes the requirement that unobligated climate-targeted funds from the IRA be funneled toward climate-specific projects—in part so they can be directed toward programs under the current farm bill, an omnibus bill for food and agriculture that the federal government renews every five to six years. The Trump megabill will increase subsidies to commodity farms by about $50 billion.

The final version of the bill doesn’t include a proposal to sell off millions of acres of public lands; this was dropped following outcry from the public and some conservation-minded GOP lawmakers. It also lacks stringent limits on the use of Chinese components in renewable energy projects that were proposed in an earlier version of the bill. Some Republican lawmakers in both the House and Senate voted for the legislation in exchange for carveouts in their states, like reduced work requirements for food stamps and less severe health care cuts.

In Thursday’s House vote, only two Republicans broke with their party to vote nay: Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who opposes measures that would increase the federal deficit, and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, who had hesitated to support cuts to Medicaid.

All Democrats voted against the bill. Immediately preceding the House vote, Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York railed against the policy in a record-breaking 8 hour and 45-minute House floor speech invoking scripture: “Our job is to stand up for the poor, the sick, and the afflicted,” he said.

Members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus have promised to hold Republicans accountable. More than three dozen of its members have said they’ll hold “Accountability Summer” events lambasting Republican lawmakers who supported the bill. “As Democrats, we must make sure they never live that down,” the group’s chair, Rep.

With Chinese EV makers dominating over 70% of Thailand’s EV market, the intense rivalry and price wars are testing the country’s strategy to have EVs comprise 30% of its auto production by 2030.

Thailand’s EV Ambitions Face Headwinds

Thailand, often called the “Detroit of Southeast Asia,” has attracted over $3 billion in investments from Chinese EV manufacturers, lured by tax breaks and subsidies aimed at boosting local production. The government’s incentive program initially required automakers to match imported EVs with locally produced ones in 2024 to avoid fines.

However, slowing sales and tight credit conditions led to a shortfall, prompting an extension into 2025 with a steeper 1.5-to-1 production ratio. “Neta’s case should give Thai policymakers pause,” said Ben Kiatkwankul, partner at Maverick Consulting Group, highlighting the risks of overreliance on foreign brands.

Neta’s Struggles Reflect Broader Challenges

Smaller Chinese EV brands like Neta are buckling under the pressure. Neta’s market share in Thailand plummeted from 12% in 2023 to 4% in the first five months of 2025, with new registrations dropping 48.5% year-over-year. The company, which sells models like the Neta V-II Lite for $16,924 (549,000 baht), struggles to compete with market leader BYD, whose Dolphin model is priced at $17,572 (569,900 baht).

Neta’s parent company, Zhejiang Hozon, entered bankruptcy in China, exacerbating issues. “I stopped ordering more cars in September because I sensed something was wrong,” said Neta dealership owner Saravut Khunpitiluck, who is now suing the company.

Price Wars and Consumer Confidence

China’s EV overcapacity has fueled aggressive price cuts, with some brands slashing prices by over 20%, according to Rujipun Assarut of KResearch. This strategy aims to stimulate demand in Thailand’s sluggish economy but has eroded margins for smaller players. Neta faces additional hurdles with customer complaints about maintenance and after-sales support, further denting confidence. “Selling cars is difficult right now,” said dealer Chatdanai Komrutai. “There’s no confidence.” These issues highlight the need for robust service networks to sustain EV adoption.

Implications for Thailand’s EV Ecosystem

Thailand’s EV push aims to transition its $53 billion internal combustion engine vehicle industry, long dominated by Japanese brands like Toyota and Honda, toward sustainable mobility. However, the influx of 18 Chinese EV brands—double last year’s count—intensifies competition and risks oversupply. “Neta’s downturn in Thailand reflects the fragility of second-tier Chinese EV brands,” said Counterpoint Research analyst Abhik Mukherjee reportedly. The dominance of BYD, now the world’s largest EV maker, underscores the challenge for smaller firms to scale in export markets.

Geopolitical tensions and potential tariffs add uncertainty, as seen in U.S. and EU restrictions on Chinese EVs. Thailand must balance attracting investment with protecting local production goals. Siamnat Panassorn of the Electric Vehicle Association of Thailand insists Neta’s woes are company-specific, but the broader trend suggests a need for policies that bolster local supply chains and consumer trust.

Looking Ahead

Thailand’s EV sector remains a critical player in Southeast Asia’s green transition, but China’s overcapacity and price wars pose significant risks. Strengthening charging infrastructure, currently at 693 stations, and fostering local battery production could enhance competitiveness. As Thailand navigates these challenges, its ability to adapt policies and support smaller players will determine whether it can achieve its 30% EV production target by 2030.

(CNN) — Household energy bills will be higher over the next decade now that Republicans have passed their tax and spending bill, according to a new analysis.

President Donald Trump and Republicans are phasing out tax credits that lower the cost to build wind and solar, which are now largely cheaper than fossil fuels like natural gas and coal.

More wind and solar on the electric grid helps keep utility bills lower, and Biden-era tax credits would have ramped up those projects.

When combined with the electric vehicle consumer tax credit being cut (you can still get the EV tax credit through September 30, 2025) annual electricity and transportation costs in every state in the continental United States will be higher than they would have if the tax credits stayed intact, analysis from think tank Energy Innovation found. Energy Innovation did not model data for Hawaii and Alaska.

Energy Innovation modeled transportation costs like gasoline for cars, as well as household electricity and heating costs in their analysis.

Red states, including Missouri, Kentucky and South Carolina, could see 13% to 14% higher energy costs by 2035 if Trump’s bill passes, compared to a scenario where the bill didn’t pass.

Annual household energy costs could rise $640 a year in Missouri by 2035 and $630 a year in Kentucky. That’s because these states would have otherwise been set to deploy a massive amount of wind and solar if Biden-era energy tax credits were left in place. Now that the GOP bill has been passed aggressively phasing out those credits, these states will have to lean on fossil fuels to generate power.

Blue states that are deliberately putting more clean energy onto their grids would still see prices rise over the coming decade, albeit far less, Orvis said. They are more immune to price shocks because they won’t be as heavily reliant on gas and coal.

“You’re moving from not using a lot of fossil fuels to using a lot of fossil fuels. That makes the price go up a lot,” said Robbie Orvis, Energy Innovation’s senior director of modeling and analysis.

Energy analysts expect the cost of natural gas and the cost of building new gas-powered plants will increase, and with it, consumer energy bills.

“Everybody’s electricity prices are going to go up,” said Rich Powell, CEO of trade group the Clean Energy Buyers Association. “I think people have in their minds that gas is a cheap way to generate power. New build natural gas is not a cheap way to generate electricity.”

Powell’s group was not involved in the Energy Innovation analysis, but has produced their own analysis with NERA Economic Consulting, also finding repealing the tax credits would raise household energy costs.

Powell added it’s an especially bad time for solar and wind tax credits to go away because there is simply more demand for electricity, with data centers and electrification of homes and vehicles. Since 2022, retail electricity prices have increased faster than the rate of inflation, according to the US Energy Information Administration, which predicts they will continue to rise through next year. US natural gas prices have also gone up, and the EIA predicts they will continue to do so next year.

On the transportation side of things, the Energy Innovation model predicts that without a $7,500 consumer tax credit to help defray the cost of electric vehicles, more people will continue to drive gas powered cars.

“That increases the spending a lot, plus that gasoline is actually a little bit more expensive because there’s so much more demand for it,” Orvis said.

Red states will see the biggest price hikes. Oklahoma energy consumers will see their bills rise 13% by 2035, or about $540 in annual costs. Oklahoma is already a wind energy powerhouse, with wind generating close to 44% of the state’s electricity. With the Biden-era energy tax incentives, Oklahoma was set to see another huge spike in wind development that could have made the state’s electricity generation carbon-free, the Energy Innovation modeling found.

Oklahoma could have become “a major exporter of electricity, because there’s so much wind being deployed,” Orvis said. “The loss of the tax credits means a lot less wind gets deployed, and that’s replaced with in-state fossil resources.”

South Carolina, another state expected to see a 13% price hike in annual energy costs with Trump’s bill, generates a lot of its electricity from nuclear, with natural gas supplying much of the remainder. Orvis said South Carolina stood to add a lot of solar to its electrical grid with tax incentives but would have to revert back to gas once those credits go away.

“You’re going from gas setting that price to renewables, and when you undo the tax credits, you see it reverting back to gas,” Orvis said.

AC out of reach, assistance under threat Many Americans simply can't afford AC due to the rising costs of summer cooling.
""Many are afraid to turn on the air conditioning because of the cost,"" said Mark Wolfe, executive director of NEADA.
If enacted, Wolfe said nearly 6 million households may have to go without air conditioning or heat.
“It's this really vicious cycle that air conditioning is contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and global warming, and then the warming temperatures are making us need air conditioning even more,” Brager said.","As the thermometer inside Shelley Snyder's three-story Victorian home in Columbus, Ohio, hits 88 degrees, she is finishing a meeting with a new maid service, watering plants, and doing chores. And she’s doing it all without air conditioning.

Snyder said she is just fine without it. Even during heat advisories, she's found ways to cope.

“We wait all winter so we can open the windows and doors and let fresh air and summer in,” she told a reporter on a day the heat index exceeded 100 degrees.

Snyder is one of about 39 million Americans − roughly 12% − who don't use AC, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. While many can't afford it or don't need it because they live in cooler climates, others choose to forgo air conditioning to lower their carbon footprint. Then there are those like Snyder, who chooses to endure sweltering temperatures in her ""big old house with high ceilings"" and top-floor skylight windows that open.

""Ceiling fans just pull the cool air out of the basement right up through the house,"" she said.

Though air conditioning can be life saving − particularly amid record setting heat waves like the one that scorched the country in late June − some people simply don’t like it, according to Gail Brager, director of the Center for the Built Environment at the University of California, Berkeley. Constant AC use can cause ""experiential monotony,"" Brager said.

“There's nothing pleasurable about it,"" she said. ""It's not healthy for our bodies to have the same conditions all the time, everywhere, and it's also experientially, not very interesting or necessarily comfortable.”

Cooler cities and states don't need AC - yet

Alaska leads the nation in going without AC, according to an analysis of U.S. Department of Energy data by University of California, Berkeley professor Lucas Davis. Just 7% of households there are air-conditioned, yet the state’s temperatures are rising exponentially as the planet warms.

Officials issued historic advisories during June’s heat wave in Alaska, where it’s warming two- to three-times faster than the global average.

In the lower 48 states, the least air-conditioned city is San Francisco, where nearly 55% of homes don’t have AC, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Housing Survey.

Devin Carraway's home is one of them. Carraway said he's lived in the Bay Area for most of his life and heat waves are rare, thus eliminating the need for air conditioning. Even if the climate were to change, he said ""AC is not going to be the first thing I do.""

""AC is throwing a lot of energy at a problem that needs to be solved through building design first,"" Carraway said.

Instead, Carraway has opted to install insulation and a white roof, which absorbs less heat. He said solar panels on the roof and his neighbor's ""really wonderful Monterey cypress tree,"" also help keep his home cool on the occasional hot days.

AC out of reach, assistance under threat

Many Americans simply can't afford AC due to the rising costs of summer cooling. That could put them at higher risk of heat illness and death.

This summer, the average electric bill is projected to reach $784, the highest cost in at least 12 years, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. Black, Hispanic and lower income households are more likely to say they don't have or don't use air conditioners due to financial challenges, according to health policy organization KFF.

""Many are afraid to turn on the air conditioning because of the cost,"" said Mark Wolfe, executive director of NEADA.

There are state and federal programs that help customers on with limited income pay their energy bills, but Wolfe said they aren't enough to meet the growing need. And the Trump administration’s proposed 2026 budget would eliminate funding for one of those programs, the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). If enacted, Wolfe said nearly 6 million households may have to go without air conditioning or heat.

Tuesday Adams, 56, of Cathedral City, California, may be one of them. She arrived at a county aid office June 25 clutching overdue utility bills topping $20,000 as temperatures hit 102 degrees. Southern California Edison has extended her deadline for more than a year, but she's received a disconnection notice.

She said she has received LIHEAP help in the past, but tries not to ask too often. Informed about the looming elimination of all federal funds for the program, she didn't mince words.

""They got to do something, they can not stop this program ... there's too many people out here really, really struggling ... a lot of families are gonna be in the dark in this heat,"" she said.

Giving up AC to break the 'vicious cycle' of climate change

Residential energy use, which includes cooling, heating and powering homes, accounts for roughly 20% of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, according to a 2020 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, a peer-reviewed scientific journal.

“It's this really vicious cycle that air conditioning is contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and global warming, and then the warming temperatures are making us need air conditioning even more,” Brager said.

Stan Cox wants to break that cycle. The author of “Losing Our Cool: Uncomfortable Truths About Our Air-Conditioned World,” deploys fans or spends time in the basement on hot days at his home in Kansas, which is shaded by trees. As a result, he used 80% less electricity than his neighbors in similarly-sized homes last June, he said citing his utility bill.

He admits something of a ""love-hate relationship"" with the innovation. When he experienced central air as a kid in 1967, he thought he had ""died and gone to heaven,"" but he later came to dislike the contrast between indoor cold and outdoor heat. “I just didn't like it,"" he said.

But Cox does turn on the AC at least once each summer ""just to make sure it's still in good working order.""

""Or if we have people coming to dinner,"" he said. ""Because we can't really invite people to dinner when it's 85 degrees in the house.""

Back in Columbus, Ohio, Snyder's neighbor has a large oak that partially shades her home in the morning. And when it does get toasty or stuffy inside, Snyder said she finds chores to do in her basement or outside.

Snyder has a portable window AC unit, but she reserves it only for visitors who stay the night. She hasn't used it in 10 years.

""I appreciate air conditioning like the next guy,"" she said. ""Would I personally like to have it? Sure. I'll be 70 this year. But I've gone this long without it.""","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/06/25/NCOD/84355264007-06252025-victorian-home-skm-1.JPG?crop=4686,2636,x0,y488&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-07-04 13:21:59.840049

Grants and tax breaks cut

UAE-US PACE deal under threat

US President Donald Trump’s latest moves on energy – including the ‘one big beautiful bill’ he has just championed to final passage in Congress – offer fresh support for traditional industry infrastructure and initiatives that bolster the country’s critical mineral supply chain.

But they scrap or drastically diminish US government commitments to renewable efforts, some of which rely on direct participation from the UAE and Emirati companies.

“I anticipate investors from the Gulf will be wary about future investments in this part of the energy complex and will focus on other areas including natural gas, nuclear and potentially hydrogen,” says Rachel Ziemba, of New York-based advisory Ziemba Insights.

The controversial and far-reaching budget law Republicans pushed through Congress at Trump’s urging further undercuts a host of Biden-era tax incentives for renewable energy.

These have been in the crosshairs of the administration since Trump’s return to the White House in January.

While final details of the legislative text are still trickling in and being analysed, it appears that the two-and-a-half year old UAE-US Partnership for Accelerating Clean Energy (PACE) might be “on the losing side of cancelled subsidies”, according to Karen Young, a senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy of Columbia University in New York.

PACE sought to harness $100 billion in “financing, investment and other support” to deploy 100 gigawatts of clean energy by 2035 in both countries as well as in emerging economies.

“For example, Masdar’s investment in Terra Gen for solar and wind power development will likely face hurdles, and the Power Africa programme is not likely to be supported by the Trump administration,” Young says.

UAE-based Averi Finance and AMEA Power joined the US-led Power Africa in October of last year with $10 billion in joint commitments.

Adnoc’s acquisition of a 35 percent stake in ExxonMobil’s low-carbon hydrogen and ammonia plant in Baytown, Texas, may also suffer after the US Department of Energy already revoked some $330 million in grant support in May, according to Young.

“All in all, it’s a disappointing about-face in energy policy for foreign investors, but especially those sovereign investors who made political investments in the US clean energy sector now to see the investment environment turned on its head,” she says.

Some private Emirati investors have talked about the stark change in the US approach to renewables as an opportunity.

Altérra’s CEO Majid Al Suwaidi said during a conference in Abu Dhabi in May that the company, the world’s largest private climate investment platform, was ready to “step in” to the gap left by declining incentives from Washington.

Meanwhile, Trump signed an executive order on June 30 – the latest in a string of presidential directives targeting the energy sector – to speed up the processes whereby the federal government picks which projects to fund.

The directive’s emphasis on streamlining investments in the critical mineral space represents a “potential win-win for GCC investors and the US,” even though follow-on details will be vital to clarify the requirements applicants must meet and how they may affect GCC-based stakeholders, Ziemba notes.

Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, co-director of the Baker Institute’s Middle East Energy Roundtable, agrees that implementation of the executive order will determine which direction the policy takes.

Ultimately it might help welcome some of the trillions of dollars in investment pledges the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Qatar made during Trump’s trip to the Gulf in May, or it might favour a strict “America first agenda” that only rewards US players, according to Ulrichsen.

Adds details throughout

The US Senate is giving wind and solar projects slightly more time to qualify for subsidies, as part of a budget bill Republicans passed today that would repeal most of the clean energy tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act while expanding oil and gas leasing.

An updated version of the bill, released shortly before it was passed Tuesday by the Senate in a 51-50 vote, would allow wind and solar projects to continue to qualify for clean electricity tax credits so long as they commence construction within 12 months of the bill’s enactment. Republican leaders also dropped a first-time excise tax on wind and solar projects they added to the bill just days ago, as they worked to shore up support from US senator Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and other moderates that had balked at a more aggressive tax credit phase-out schedule.

The Senate-passed bill would still zero out tax credits for wind and solar projects that are not placed into service before the end of 2027 — in line with a draft of the bill released on 28 June — but developers that start construction within 12 months can still qualify for tax credits worth up to 30pc of a project’s cost or up to $15/MWh. Renewable energy officials saw that change as an improvement over the initial draft, which could have ended credits for projects already under development.

Business Council for Sustainable Energy president Lynn Abramson, said the legislation still represents a, said:

Significant step backward for the industry.

The bill, which passed with US vice president JD Vance casting a tie-breaking vote, will now advance to the US House of Representatives for a final vote as soon as Wednesday. House speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) said the chamber will “work quickly” to pass the bill, although doing so will require near-unanimous support from House Republicans, some of whom have bristled at changes the Senate made to the bill. President Donald Trump said today he wants a final vote by 4 July and urged House Republicans to ignore “its occasional ‘GRANDSTANDERS'” that have previously held up his legislative agenda.

The US Congressional Budget Office, said:

The Senate bill is expected to cut about $560bn of clean energy tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act, according to estimates based on the 28 June version of the bill.

But those savings will be dwarfed by other spending in the bill and additional tax cuts that, if enacted, are expected to add nearly $3.3 trillion to the debt over the next decade,

The bill would repeal a $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles purchased after 30 September and zero out all penalties against automakers that fail to meet fuel-economy standards, undermining incentives for automakers to sell electric and hybrid vehicles. Tesla chief executive Elon Musk, who earlier this year worked alongside Trump on a cost-cutting “DOGE” project, said the bill would destroy millions of jobs.

Musk, said in a social media post on 28 June,

Utterly insane and destructive,

“It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future.”

The Senate softened some of the tax credit cuts the House voted for in May. Clean hydrogen projects would need to start construction by 1 January 2028 to qualify for a tax credit of up to $3/kg, rather than facing a House deadline at the end of 2025. In another change, the bill extends a tax credit for biofuels by two years, until 2029, rather than a four-year extension the Senate initially proposed.

The bill would expand federal oil and gas leasing by mandating twice yearly lease sales in the US Gulf of Mexico and regular onshore leases, in addition to slashing royalty rates to the lowest levels in nearly two decades. The bill would also indefinitely delay the collection of a $900/metric tonne fee on methane leaks and reinstate a federal tax deduction for “intangible” drilling costs. Another program would provide $171mn to buy crude to refill the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a fraction of the $1.3bn fund that was passed by the House.

Republicans initially sought to overhaul permitting through the bill, but the only program that is eligible for the filibuster-proof process used for the bill would allow industry to pay a fee to fast-track environmental reviews. The bill would also cut royalties on coal mined on federal land, provide a tax credit for metallurgical coal, repeal climate-related grant programs from the Inflation Reduction Act, and permanently extend some business tax breaks.

Dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill” by its sponsors — and the “Big Ugly Bill” by critics — the legislation makes permanent the 2017 tax cuts for corporations and high earners, repeals the IRS Direct File system, and implements historic cuts to Medicaid, SNAP, and federal education aid.

The bill cleared the US House on a narrow 218-214 vote, with nearly every Republican voting in favor except for Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Warren Davidson of Ohio, who broke ranks to oppose the measure. Both cited concerns about the bill’s long-term fiscal impact and deep cuts to federal entitlement programs

Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont condemned the bill, calling it “a massive income transfer from the poorest and most vulnerable Americans to the wealthiest.”

“This bill is going to have devastating impacts on millions of Americans for years to come,” Lamont said in a statement. “Even the Republicans in Congress were reluctant to vote for it because they know the negative impact it will have on the public — especially the most vulnerable.”

Lamont warned that Connecticut, like other states, lacks the capacity to backfill the bill’s sweeping cuts.

“Kicking people off their health insurance, defunding hospitals and nursing homes, and eliminating food and nutrition assistance is going to have a ripple effect throughout the country,” he said.

One of the most far-reaching changes is the addition of work requirements to Medicaid. Beginning in 2026, adults aged 19 to 64 in the expansion population must complete 80 hours per month of employment or community engagement. States must also conduct redeterminations of eligibility every six months — doubling the administrative burden and increasing the risk of coverage loss, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities.

Tiffany Donelson, president and CEO of the Connecticut Health Foundation, called the legislation “a sad day” for the state.

“It will leave thousands of Connecticut residents uninsured,” she said. “It will lead more people to go longer without medical care, expose more residents to medical debt, harm the stability of our hospitals and health care providers, and cost our state hundreds of millions of dollars.”

The Connecticut Hospital Association warned that the cuts will strain the entire system.

“These costs will be borne not only by caregivers but also by employers, employees, the insured, and all Connecticut taxpayers,” the association said in a statement.

The bill also dramatically restructures SNAP. States will be required to cover 5% of administrative costs — ending nearly 50 years of full federal funding — and the federal match will drop from 50% to 25%. Connecticut’s error rate has ranged from 4.9% to 10.5%, making it vulnerable to penalties between $44 million and $222 million annually.

The bill reinstates benefit time limits for certain unemployed adults and restricts eligibility for immigrants and asylum seekers. It also freezes future benefit increases by capping the Thrifty Food Plan, cutting monthly benefits by $7 per person by 2027 and $15 by 2034.

Norma Martinez-HoSang, director of CT for All, said the bill will create a humanitarian crisis.

“Millions of Connecticut residents will feel the crushing weight of the consequences,” she said. “Lamont’s effective ‘thoughts and prayers’ response belittles the most important choice his administration has been faced with: let people go unfed, unhoused, and uninsured, or declare a state of emergency and enact progressive revenue solutions to save lives.”

Emily Byrne, executive director of Connecticut Voices for Children, said the bill will force families to make impossible choices between food, health care, and housing.

“The ultimate cost of these historic cuts to Medicaid and SNAP will be human lives — the unnecessary death of Connecticut residents — unless state lawmakers choose another direction,” Byrne said. “To be clear, it shouldn’t have to be on states to right the wrongs of the federal government, but the proverbial ball is in our court.”

Her organization is urging lawmakers to raise taxes on Connecticut’s wealthiest residents and redirect that revenue to protect basic services.

The bill also overhauls federal education funding. It eliminates Pell Grants for part-time students, ends subsidized student loans, and imposes new taxes on scholarships and fellowships. It introduces a $25-billion school voucher-style tax credit, redirecting public dollars to private and religious schools.

CEA President Kate Dias called the bill “an unconscionable stripping away of benefits from those who are most in need to provide tax cuts for wealthy corporations.”

“This bill makes it even more difficult for students to pursue their educational aspirations,” she said. “It adds to the challenges teachers already face and discourages young people from entering the profession.”

Dias thanked Connecticut’s congressional delegation for opposing the bill and pledged that educators will continue to “stand up for students and their families” at the ballot box and in policymaking spaces.

In a sharp rebuke of Democratic criticism, House Republican Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford, released a statement Thursday calling the reaction “as predictable as it is ridiculous.”

“The sky-is-falling meltdown from Governor Lamont and Connecticut Democrats over an America First agenda is … panicking, because it exposes how badly their policies are failing working families,” he said.

Candelora dismissed the criticism as partisan theater, arguing that the bill reflects a necessary shift away from what he described as failed economic policies under Democratic leadership.

Despite being promoted as a deficit reduction measure, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill will increase the federal deficit by $3.3 trillion over the next decade, primarily due to permanent tax cuts and the repeal of Direct File.

Lamont said his administration is reviewing the legislation’s impact on Connecticut’s services and budget and will meet with General Assembly leaders in the coming days.

How $1.66 Billion Changes Everything

The DOE loan directly addresses the primary concern that has weighed on Plug Power's stock. It provides a clear financial runway to build out a planned network of up to six green hydrogen production facilities across the United States. For investors, the impact is multifaceted and significant.

Lower-Cost Capital: This loan is a much cheaper source of funding than issuing new stock, a process that can be dilutive. Share dilution occurs when a company issues new shares, which reduces the ownership percentage of existing shareholders. By using this loan, Plug Power protects its investors' equity.

A Clear Path to Scale: The capital is designated explicitly for building out the company's production network, providing a clear, funded path to achieving commercial scale and reducing reliance on third-party suppliers.

Government Endorsement: The DOE's backing signals that Plug Power is a strategic national asset. This validation lends a new layer of credibility to the enterprise, which can be crucial for attracting future partners and customers.

Plug Power's Production Network Comes Online

With a more straightforward funding path, the focus turns to Plug's ability to execute its vertically integrated vision, and recent milestones show tangible progress. The company's goal is to control the entire hydrogen process, from producing the fuel to manufacturing the machines that utilize it. This control is key to improving gross margins, which measure a company’s profitability on the products it sells.

Georgia and Louisiana Plants: The company's facility in Georgia is the largest liquid green hydrogen plant in the North American market. Following that success, the new 15-ton-per-day (TPD) facility in Louisiana is now commissioned, bringing Plug's total U.S. production network capacity to approximately 40 TPD.

Commercial Validation: In June 2025, Plug signed a multi-year supply agreement with a major U.S. industrial gas company, demonstrating clear commercial demand for the hydrogen produced by these new plants.

Next Up - Texas: The green hydrogen plant in Graham, Texas, is slated to be the first project to utilize the DOE loan, with a target to begin drawing funds in late 2025 or early 2026.

Plug Power CFO’s Share Purchase Signals Executive Confidence

Two recent developments provide corroborating evidence for the bullish outlook. First, a U.S. Senate committee advanced the Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit Extension Act. This bill, which extends a key tax credit deadline to 2036, provides crucial long-term financial certainty for the very projects the DOE loan will fund.

Second, company insiders are signaling a strong belief in Plug's future. In May and June 2025, Plug Power's CFO, Paul Middleton, purchased a combined 1,000,000 shares on the open market. This represents a significant vote of confidence from a top executive with direct insight into the company's financial turnaround. This action is more telling than other pre-scheduled insider sales, signaling genuine bullishness from the C-suite at current price levels.

A Pivotal Entry Point for Long-Term Investors

The investment case for Plug Power has undergone a critical shift. The primary risk is no longer centered on financial survival. Still, it has pivoted to operational execution, a far more favorable position for a company with operational plants and a funded growth plan. Recent stock volatility suggests the market may not have fully priced in this de-risking event, potentially creating an opportunity.

Investors should monitor key metrics in the upcoming quarters, such as continued improvements in gross margin, new commercial contracts, and the successful deployment of DOE loan funds.

For those with a multi-year horizon and a desire to invest in the hydrogen energy sector, the combination of government validation, a secured funding path, and clear signs of insider conviction signals that now is an opportune time to cautiously accumulate a position in a leader of the green hydrogen revolution.

EPA press secretary Brigit Hirsch accused the employees of ""undermining, sabotaging, and undercutting the administration's agenda."" But the union that represents these employees is calling it an act of illegal ""retaliation.""

The ""declaration of dissent"", published by Stand Up for Science Monday, had been signed by 620 people as of Thursday. Addressed to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, the letter accused the administration of ""recklessly undermining"" the agency's mission under his watch. It accused the administration of ""ignoring scientific consensus to benefit polluters.""

""This administration's actions directly contradict EPA's own scientific assessments on human health risks, most notably regarding asbestos, mercury, and greenhouse gases,"" the letter said.

Since Trump retook office, the administration has eviscerated policies meant to contain pollution, slashing funding for green energy production and electric vehicles while championing increased fossil fuel drilling and consumption. It has also rolled back the enforcement of limits on cancer-causing ""forever chemicals"" in water.

The signatories also pointed to the Trump EPA's ""undermining of public trust"" by using official channels to trumpet ""misinformation and overtly partisan rhetoric.""

They called out EPA press releases, which have referred to climate science as a ""religion,"" EPA grants as ""green slush funds,"" and ""clean coal"" as ""beautiful."" The letter also suggested the EPA had violated the Hatch Act by promoting political initiatives like Trump's tariffs and the Republican budget reconciliation bill.

""Make no mistake: your actions endanger public health and erode scientific progress—not only in America—but around the world,"" the letter said.

The employees also accused the administration of ""promoting a culture of fear."" They cited comments by top Trump officials, such as Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, who has said he wanted to put EPA employees ""in trauma"" and make them unable ""to go to work because they are increasingly viewed as the villains.""

While some signatories signed their names, many others chose to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation. That retaliation came Thursday, when—according to The New York Times—144 employees received an email putting them on leave for the next two weeks ""pending an administrative investigation.""

The decision was widely criticized as a violation of the employees' First Amendment rights.

Tim Whitehouse, the executive director of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, which has previously represented EPA and other employees, said federal employees are allowed to publicly criticize the administration they work for.

""The letter of dissent did really nothing to undermine or sabotage the agenda of the administration,"" Whitehouse told The Washington Post. ""We believe strongly that the EPA should protect the First Amendment rights of their employees.""

Bill Wolfe, a former environmental policy professional with Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, said that the letter ""was a classic form of whistleblowing that is protected by federal whistleblower laws and the 1st Amendment, as upheld by federal courts.""

Justin Chen, the union representative for EPA employees under the American Federation of Government Employees, told the Times that the agency's actions were ""clearly an act of retaliation"" and said the union would ""protect our members to the full extent of the law.""

Despite the punishment, one of the signatories anonymously told The Post that they had no regrets.

The mostly party-line vote of 218-214, which came one day ahead of Trump’s July 4 deadline, caps an arduous process that lasted more than four months, rife with ideological clashes and acrimony between the House and the Senate, where Republicans had little margin for error given their narrow majorities.

In the end, the GOP largely unified to pack the bulk of Trump’s domestic agenda into a single measure, with just Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania voting against it. A bloc of Republican holdouts had initially opposed a procedural vote Wednesday to advance the bill, leading to an hourslong overnight standoff. But Trump and Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., managed to sway all but one of them, teeing up final passage in the House.

Follow live politics coverage here

Trump is expected to sign the bill into law on Independence Day, marking the party’s biggest legislative accomplishment since it took full control of Washington in January.

Trump applauded Republicans after the bill passed Thursday, writing on Truth Social that the successful effort signaled a united Republican Party.

“The Republicans in the House of Representatives have just passed the 'ONE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL ACT.' Our Party is UNITED like never before and, our Country is 'HOT.' We are going to have a Signing Celebration at the White House,” he wrote. “All Congressmen/women and Senators are invited.”

Trump continued the praise Thursday evening at an event in Des Moines, Iowa, organized to celebrate Independence Day.

""There could be no better birthday present for America than the phenomenal victory we achieved just hours ago when Congress passed the One Big Beautiful Bill to make America great again,"" he said, lauding the legislation as ""a declaration of independence from a national decline.""

The 887-page package, dubbed the ""one big, beautiful bill,"" extends the tax cuts Trump enacted in 2017 while temporarily slashing taxes on tips and overtime pay. It approves hundreds of billions of dollars in new spending on the military and on carrying out Trump’s mass deportation plans. And it partly pays for all that with steep cuts to Medicaid, food aid benefits and clean energy funding. That includes an estimated $930 billion in spending reductions under Medicaid, violating Trump's promise not to cut the program.

Overall, the bill is projected to increase the national debt by $3.3 trillion over a decade, with the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office finding that the revenue losses of $4.5 trillion outstrip the spending cuts of $1.2 trillion. The bill also increases the debt ceiling by $5 trillion.

Republican leaders celebrate

Throughout the process, Republican leaders had an ace in the hole to corral the votes even as the competing demands of rival factions appeared irreconcilable: They knew their members wouldn’t ultimately say no to Trump, from the most conservative to the least ideological and politically vulnerable.

“Republicans in Congress have succeeded in our mission to enact President Trump’s America First agenda,” Johnson said in joint statement with his leadership team. “And importantly, we did it in record time, so that the effects of this nation-shaping legislation can be felt by the American people as soon as possible.”

Republicans often turned to Trump throughout the process to help close the deal on key votes. He regularly held meetings with and made phone calls to key lawmakers while issuing the occasional threat on Truth Social to holdouts who stood in the bill’s way. Vice President JD Vance was also a regular presence in Senate and House meetings about the bill.

“If President Trump and Vice President Vance had not engaged at the time they did, it wouldn’t have passed,” said conservative Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., who attended White House meetings in the Oval Office and the Cabinet Room on Wednesday and ultimately voted for the bill.

Speaking to reporters in the wee hours of the morning, Johnson said Trump had been making phone calls to recalcitrant holdouts as late as 1 a.m. Thursday to help break an impasse on the floor.

“He doesn’t really sleep a lot,” said Johnson, who also dangled the prospect of future bills to address concerns and demands from a variety of members.

In his 1 a.m. call with holdouts, Trump and other White House officials promised to aggressively implement key provisions in the bill — from clean energy tax credit phaseouts to new Medicaid restrictions, a source familiar with the call said.

One by one, the GOP critics folded and accepted demands they insisted they wouldn’t. Conservatives swallowed a bill that adds trillions to the debt. Politically vulnerable Republicans endorsed steep cuts to Medicaid and health care spending that the CBO projects will cost 11.8 million people their insurance. Republicans whose districts and states benefit from clean energy incentives ended up voting to strip them away.

“They’re just afraid of Trump and the backlash that would ensue if he called them out,” Massie, who opposed the bill, told NBC News the day before the final vote. “I’m not concerned.”

Trump told reporters Thursday that it was ""easy"" to get skeptical Republicans on board during his conversations and said he didn't offer any lawmakers specific commitments or promises.

""I did not have much of a problem with any of them,"" he said. ""No deals. What I did is we talked about how good the bill is.""

GOP holdouts fold after threats to vote no

Rep. David Valadao, R-Calif., led a June 24 letter from 16 Republicans vowing to oppose the Senate bill because of its Medicaid cuts, which were more aggressive than those in an earlier bill. They warned that the bill would impose “penalties” for states with larger programs, “cuts to emergency Medicaid funding” and “additional burdens on hospitals already stretched thin.”

“Protecting Medicaid is essential for the vulnerable constituents we were elected to represent. Therefore, we cannot support a final bill that threatens access to coverage or jeopardizes the stability of our hospitals and providers,” they wrote.

The following week, all 16 of them voted for the bill anyway. Valadao’s office didn’t reply to requests for comment.

Trump and his allies sought to strike fear in GOP lawmakers by vowing to support a primary challenger to Massie in his next election. Massie, who objected to the large deficit increase in the bill, said Trump’s real goal was to keep other Republicans in line by sending a message that defying him comes with political pain.

“They’re whipping this horse, because I’m out of the barn, to keep the other horses in the barn,” he said.

Fitzpatrick, who represents a swing district, said the steeper Medicaid cuts, “in addition to several other Senate provisions,” moved him from supporting an earlier version of the bill to opposing the final one.

“I believe in, and will always fight for, policies that are thoughtful, compassionate, and good for our community,” he said in a statement. “It is this standard that will always guide my legislative decisions.”

Later, on the 1 a.m. call with Trump, Massie remarked that it would be nice if Trump stopped attacking him, the source said, then flipped from no to yes on the key procedural vote.

Trump said Thursday that he was ""disappointed"" that Fitzpatrick voted against the bill but stopped short of backing a primary challenge against him.

Democrats slam the bill as 'disgusting'

The House took up the bill after the Senate voted 51-50 to pass it on Tuesday, with Vance breaking the tie. The only Republicans who voted against it were Rand Paul of Kentucky, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Susan Collins of Maine. The party used the filibuster-proof “budget reconciliation” process to get around the 60-vote threshold, which meant some non-budgetary provisions were stripped out.

Every Democrat in both chambers voted against the bill, blasting it as a tax cut for the wealthy that is paid for by cutting programs that benefit the working class, like Medicaid. They plan to place a heavy focus on the bill in their message to voters ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, emboldened by polls showing that the legislation is unpopular.

At the start of a record-breaking floor speech Thursday morning that lasted for 8 hours and 44 minutes, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., ripped what he called the “big, ugly bill, this disgusting abomination,” and accused Republicans of working through the night to pass it because it would kick millions of people off Medicaid and food stamps. Republicans argued that work requirements would target waste, fraud and abuse in those programs.

“Why did debate begin at 3:28 a.m. in the morning?” Jeffries asked with House Democrats filling the seats behind him. “Republicans are once again, which has been the case, Mr. Speaker, through every step of this journey, trying to jam this bill through the House of Representatives under cover of darkness.”

Trump decried Democratic opposition in his remarks in Iowa, bluntly telling supporters that he ""hates"" Democrats.

“They wouldn’t vote only because they hate Trump, but I hate them, too, you know?” he said. “I really do. I hate them. I cannot stand them, because I really believe they hate our country.”

Republicans began making plans for their reconciliation package even before last year’s presidential election. In March 2024, House Republicans huddled at their annual retreat, at the Greenbrier Resort in West Virginia, to brainstorm what should be in the bill so they'd be better prepared than in 2017.

But after Republicans took unified control of the White House and Congress in January, fissures in the party quickly began to emerge. Senate leaders pushed to carry out Trump’s agenda in two separate bills, before he endorsed the House approach of passing his agenda in “one big, beautiful bill,” which eventually became the title of the legislation.

Along the way, all 53 Senate Republicans voted to set a novel precedent by using a budget trick known as “current policy baseline,” which treats $3.8 trillion in Trump tax cut extensions as costing $0, to avoid satisfying Senate rules requiring that they be paid for. Democrats said it was akin to the “nuclear option” and that it will weaken the 60-vote threshold going forward.

Still, Democrats did get in a jab at Trump in the process: They deleted the title, “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” by successfully arguing that the name wasn’t budgetary in nature. The legislation’s official title is, instead, “An Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to title II of H. Con. Res. 14.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/250702-mike-johnson-ac-652p-2aaf70.jpg",N,,2025-07-04 14:13:49.754265

President Trump is getting the Independence Day signing ceremony he's been demanding.

MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:

This is for the megabill he and Republicans in Congress pushed over the finish line yesterday afternoon. Speaking under the wing of Air Force One as he departed for a victory rally in Iowa, Trump said the celebration would include a military aircraft flyover.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And it's going to be a great day. So we'll be signing with those beautiful planes flying right over our heads.

MARTIN: The One Big Beautiful Bill, as President Trump has been calling it, contains the president's entire domestic legislative agenda.

MARTÍNEZ: With more, we're joined now by NPR senior White House correspondent Tamara Keith. So, Tam, what is the president saying about this bill's passage?

TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Well, as you might imagine, he and his allies are taking a victory lap. Trump was in Iowa last night for a rally and said with this bill, he kept every major promise he made to voters when he ran for office last year.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

TRUMP: Very simply, the One Big Beautiful Bill will deliver the strongest border on earth, the strongest economy on earth, the strongest military on earth, and ensure the United States of America will remain the strongest country anywhere on this beautiful planet of ours.

(CHEERING)

KEITH: Trump was, to borrow a word he likes to use, rather braggadocious about his success last night, asking, has anybody ever had a better two weeks?

MARTÍNEZ: Now, 48 hours ago, though, there was some drama. I mean, it looked like that bill and the president's timeline were in trouble. So what happened?

KEITH: Well, there were quite a few Republican holdouts, but President Trump turned on the charm, and then he turned up the pressure. And ultimately, all but two Republicans in the House who had been holding out folded. At a press conference after the bill passed, Majority Leader Steve Scalise gave Trump all the credit.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

STEVE SCALISE: Donald Trump absolutely was our closer, and Donald Trump never stopped - every day was there in the fight. Who do I need to call? What do I need to do? No president more directly engaged.

KEITH: This was a pivotal moment in Trump's presidency and he and his party rose to it. It took all-night debates and arm-twisting and passed with incredibly narrow margins in both the House and the Senate. And the question now is whether it becomes a long-term political win or more of an albatross.

MARTÍNEZ: Oh, OK. Sounds like you're talking about the midterm elections.

KEITH: Indeed. Next year, Republicans in swing districts will have to defend their votes. And so far, public polling has found this bill to be pretty unpopular. Democrats have had a lot of success in branding it as a tax cut for the rich at the expense of the poor and the vulnerable. A senior White House official conceded in a call yesterday with reporters that the president and Republicans are going to have to educate the public on what's actually in the bill, including things that are popular, like no tax on tips or expanding the child tax credit.

And another thing to watch is the Medicaid cuts in the bill, which an independent analysis found would cause nearly 12 million people to lose coverage. Those will phase in more slowly, which may give Republicans some political cover because people often don't draw a direct line between things happening in their lives and something politicians in Washington passed years earlier.

MARTÍNEZ: Yeah. Now, still a lot of uncertainty, though, various global conflicts, the U.S. tariff policy. What challenges lie ahead, though?

KEITH: Well, it depends on how you feel about tariffs. Early next week, Trump's tariff pause is set to end and his administration has not had much success striking trade deals. So he says he's just going to start sending letters to countries telling them how high their tariffs will be going forward. Economists say tariffs are going to hit American consumers, but Trump is unconcerned.

Trump is also burning up the phones to various world leaders, trying to wind down the conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine, and then there's Iran - all of which is to say, a president's work is never done.

It also highlighted that, last year, nuclear energy consumption exceeded coal consumption for the first time ever.
“Used for heating, cooking, and lighting, wood remained the largest U.S. energy source until the late 1800s, when coal consumption became more common,” it added.
“Other forms of renewable energy did not become significant contributors to U.S. energy production until more recently.
In its latest short term energy outlook (STEO), which was published last month, the EIA projected that total U.S. energy consumption will come in at 95.39 quads in 2025.","A new analysis piece published on the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) website recently, which was penned by Mickey Francis, Program Manager and Lead Economist for the EIA’s State Energy Data System, has outlined how U.S. energy use has changed since the Declaration of Independence was signed in 1776.

The piece highlighted that, according to the EIA’s monthly energy review, in 2024, the U.S. consumed about 94 quadrillion British thermal units (quads) of energy. Fossil fuels - namely petroleum, natural gas, and coal - made up 82 percent of total U.S. energy consumption last year, the piece pointed out, adding that non-fossil fuel energy accounted for the other 18 percent.

Petroleum remained the most-consumed fuel in the United States, the piece stated, outlining that this has been the case for the past 75 years. It also highlighted that, last year, nuclear energy consumption exceeded coal consumption for the first time ever.

The analysis piece went on to note that, when the Declaration of Independence was signed in 1776, wood was the largest source of energy in the United States.

“Used for heating, cooking, and lighting, wood remained the largest U.S. energy source until the late 1800s, when coal consumption became more common,” it added.

“Wood energy is still consumed, mainly by industrial lumber and paper plants that burn excess wood waste to generate electricity,” it continued.

The piece went on to highlight that coal was the largest source of U.S. energy for about 65 years, from 1885 until 1950.

“Early uses of coal included many purposes that are no longer common, such as in stoves for home heating and in engines for trains and ships. Since the 1960s, nearly all coal consumed in the United States has been for electricity generation,” the piece said.

The analysis piece went on to state that petroleum has been the most consumed source of energy in the United States since 1950.

“Petroleum products such as motor gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and propane are commonly used across all sectors of the U.S. economy, from transportation to industrial chemicals and plastics,” it said.

“Natural gas is the second largest source of U.S. energy consumption, as it has been most years since it surpassed coal in 1958. Natural gas was once considered a waste byproduct of crude oil production but now has become a common energy source for heating and electricity generation,” it added.

The analysis piece noted that the first industrial use of hydropower to generate electricity in the United States was to power lamps at a chair factory in Grand Rapids, Michigan, in 1880. The world’s first hydroelectric power plant to sell electricity to the public opened on the Fox River near Appleton, Wisconsin, in 1882, it added.

“Other forms of renewable energy did not become significant contributors to U.S. energy production until more recently. In 2016, biofuels - including the fuel ethanol mixed in motor gasoline - became the most-consumed U.S. renewable energy source,” the piece noted.

“Electricity generation from some zero-carbon sources, such as wind and solar, has increased rapidly in recent years, while generation from others, such as hydropower and nuclear, has remained relatively flat,” it said.

“In 2022, U.S. energy consumption from renewable sources surpassed nuclear energy for the first time since 1984, and in 2023, renewables surpassed coal for the first time since around the early 1880s. The United States now consumes more energy from wind and solar sources individually than from hydropower,” it went on to state.

The piece highlighted that, in order to compare different forms of energy, the EIA converted to common units of heat called British thermal units.

In its latest short term energy outlook (STEO), which was published last month, the EIA projected that total U.S. energy consumption will come in at 95.39 quads in 2025.

This year, U.S. liquid fuels demand is forecast to hit 20.39 million barrels per day, U.S. natural gas demand is projected to come in at 91.3 billion cubic feet per day, U.S. coal demand is projected to hit 428 million short tons, and U.S. renewables demand is forecast to come in at 8.94 quads, the EIA’s June STEO showed.",https://images.rigzone.com/images/news/articles/How-Has-USA-Energy-Use-Changed-Since-1776-181049-1200x628.png,N,,2025-07-04 11:08:15.206538

Buyers have until Sept. 30 to qualify for the federal tax credits on EVs before they are terminated. However, experts say there are still strong financial reasons to consider buying the vehicles even without those incentives.

Before the bill passed, new electric vehicles came with a $7,500 federal tax credit and used EVs included up to $4,000. Those incentives were originally designed to help make the vehicles more affordable. According to the latest data from Kelley Blue Book, the average purchase price of a new EV is roughly $9,000 higher in the United States than the average new gas-powered car. Used EVs, on average, cost $2,000 more than comparable gas cars.

Those credits, paired with other incentives in many states, helped bridge that price gap. Without them, Senior Policy Director Ingrid Malmgren of the nonprofit advocacy group Plug In America said they will become unaffordable to many lower- and middle-income Americans.

“That's really disappointing because ... they're just a really great way to reduce transportation energy cost burden,"" Malmgren said.

The up-front cost of an electric vehicle might be higher, but for those who can afford to consider the lifetime fuel and maintenance savings, Malmgren said buying an EV is still a good financial and environmental move in every state.

EVs are typically still cheaper to own long-term

That is because electric vehicles might not be cheaper to buy, but they are cheaper to drive. Malmgren said that even without the federal tax credits, an electric vehicle owner would still come out ahead.

“Quickly, you'll end up paying less than a gas car because it costs much less to fuel, and it needs almost nothing for maintenance,” Malmgren said.

Malmgren said the point at which an EV driver's savings on fuel and maintenance outweigh the higher initial price varies. It depends on the kind of car and how often they are driven, as well as the cost of gasoline and electricity in an area. She said EV owners pay less in upkeep because the cars typically have fewer moving parts to maintain and require less frequent servicing.

The study did not account for the car's purchase price, its maintenance cost or associated tax credits.

EVs are still cleaner, even when they charge on coal power

Manufacturing an electric vehicle typically creates more pollution than making a traditional gas-powered one, but experts say that driving an EV over the long term is still less polluting than a gas car.

Once they both drive about 15,000 miles (24,000 km) — slightly more than the average American drives in a year — the total pollution that has gone into making and driving each type of car has evened out, said Peter Slowik, U.S. passenger vehicles lead for the International Council on Clean Transportation. Every mile after that widens the gap between the cleaner electric car and the more pollutive gas car. By the end of the car's life, emissions caused by the average EV are roughly half the average gas car, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

So unless you buy a new car each year, the EV is the cleaner choice, he said.

“Republicans’ bill also makes detrimental and utterly shortsighted cuts to clean energy tax credits, raising families’ energy bills and eliminating millions of manufacturing jobs across the country,” Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said in a statement.","Just as Washington state’s need for clean and renewable electricity ticks sharply upward, Congressional Republicans voted to slash the very tools the federal government has used to encourage green energy projects and to incentivize people to buy things like electric vehicles and solar panels.

Voting along razor-thin margins, Congress approved a huge spending bill championed by President Donald Trump on Thursday. It extends tax cuts passed in Trump’s first term and includes new ones, greatly increases spending on immigration enforcement and offsets some of this new spending with cuts to Medicaid, food assistance and a series of clean energy tax breaks.

The pullback on clean energy support has public officials, energy experts and green industry leaders across Washington state bracing for a devastating blow. They say this bill will result in higher electric bills, a less-reliable grid, an overhaul of the renewable industry and the death or delay of major wind, solar and battery projects.

In Washington, it puts at least $8.7 billion in clean energy investments at risk, according to Gov. Bob Ferguson. An estimated 21,800 Washingtonians would lose their jobs by 2030 due to the bill’s reduction in clean energy and manufacturing tax credits, and Washington household electricity costs could go up by $115 per year by 2029, according to an assessment from the U.S. Climate Alliance, a group of mostly Democratic governors.

The legislation serves as the latest example of Trump’s attack on climate science. He has repeatedly placed his thumb on the scales in favor of coal, natural gas and other fossil fuels churning out planet-warming greenhouse gasses.

Democrats rallied against the measure but Washington’s two Republican House members — Dan Newhouse and Mike Baumgartner — supported the legislation. Newhouse and Baumgartner didn’t respond to requests for comment on the cuts to the tax credits.

“Republicans’ bill also makes detrimental and utterly shortsighted cuts to clean energy tax credits, raising families’ energy bills and eliminating millions of manufacturing jobs across the country,” Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said in a statement.

State Rep. Joe Fitzgibbon, D-West Seattle, sees no benefits to Trump’s mega bill, only pain.

“Washingtonians can expect more blackouts but at least they’ll have less health care and higher deficits,” said Fitzgibbon, who is also House majority leader.

Dinner table economics

Generally, energy analysts are in agreement that the legislation will raise energy costs for households across the country, in part because of higher dependence on fossil fuels and higher fossil fuel prices.

According to an analysis by think tank Energy Innovation, the bill will raise the cost of wholesale electricity by 14% by 2035. The think tank also estimated annual energy costs will increase modestly — $39 by 2030 and $55 by 2035 per year.

Cuts to incentives for electric heat pumps, rooftop solar panels and more-efficient insulation or water heaters will mean federal funds will no longer be available for people wanting to upgrade their homes or businesses, said Charlee Thompson, a policy analyst for the nonprofit NW Energy Coalition.

As summers trend hotter and hotter, people struggling to maintain the temperature in their homes and offices will continue to swelter, Thompson said.

Not only will investment in things like heat pumps slow but so too will electric vehicle purchases or the installation of charging infrastructure, Fitzgibbon said. State incentives will remain in place, funded through things like the Climate Commitment Act, but without federal money to supplement those dollars won’t stretch nearly as far.

The Port of Seattle also said in a statement that the legislation will slow its efforts to decarbonize and transition toward electrifying its vehicles and buildings.

Congress axed the $7,500 incentive for buying an electric vehicles, and $4,000 incentive for used ones. People interested in taking advantage of the credits have until Sept. 30 before they disappear.

These cuts will likely delay the growth of electric vehicles, not end it, said Matthew Metz, founder and co-executive director of Seattle-based electric vehicle advocacy group Coltura.

The charging infrastructure is improving, and the cost of building them is going down, Metz said, “I think pretty much everyone agrees, or a lot of auto industry observers agree that EVs will become the predominant form of transportation.”

Rethinking the renewable industry

Washington companies that install solar panels at homes and businesses are among those that may soon be forced to reconsider their business model, which has been built in part on the government subsidizing the cost.

“I do not know if we’ll be able to survive unless we completely change what we do,” said Will Sumner, CEO and co-owner of Puget Sound Solar. He suggested his solar-only company will have to move into broader electrical work. “And that just is heartbreaking.”

Virtually all of the company’s residential solar installations have been on the back of a federal tax credit that is now set to sunset by the end of the year.

The credits have been in place for years but the Inflation Reduction Act, passed in former President Joe Biden’s term, had extended the credits into the next decade giving installers a runway for their eventual phaseout.

The credit has covered 30% of the system cost. When it goes away, estimates suggest it could shrink the residential market in Washington by 50% to 60%, Sumner said.

Sumner said they will be able to survive without the subsidies but solar companies need an offramp. Instead, Sumner said, the rug is being jerked out from under them.

Utility-scale renewable projects

The state is already behind schedule for requirements set by the Clean Energy Transformation Act of 2019 to free its electrical grid of greenhouse gas emissions by 2045, said state Commerce Director Joe Nguyễn. The federal legislation throws another substantial roadblock in the way.

State leaders acknowledged pulling back support for renewable energy projects like wind and solar farms could make it even harder to meet these requirements. Though Ecology Director Casey Sixkiller believes as long as the state continues to lower the barriers to getting projects sited and built, it will continue to attract these energy investments.

Due to changes in tax credits, Energy Innovation’s analysis estimated the legislation will decrease electricity capacity in Washington by 18 gigawatts by 2035 with solar and battery storage making up around 8 and 6 gigawatts respectively.

A past analysis from a Seattle-based nonprofit found the state will need 22 gigawatts of renewable energy by 2035 to replace electricity generated by coal and methane gas.

President Trump has issued a series of Executive Orders (""EOs"") intended to encourage U.S. oil, natural gas and coal production and the growth of the U.S. nuclear energy industry by seeking to overhaul regulations and speed up licenses.

Since President Trump took office in 2025, the U.S. Department of Energy (""DOE"") has taken a series of actions to promote the U.S. production of coal potentially through various federal support programs, including those under the DOE's loan authority. In addition, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (""FERC"") has taken action to reduce regulatory barriers and speed up the construction of natural gas infrastructure projects in the U.S.

In contrast, recent legislation passed by the U.S. House of Representatives in May 2025, and now under consideration by the U.S. Senate, would reduce tax credits for solar, wind, hydrogen and other renewable energy sources.

1. INTRODUCTION

This client alert summarizes (1) the recent EOs seeking to bolster the oil, gas, coal and nuclear energy industries, (2) recent orders issued by the DOE and actions by FERC to promote the U.S. production of coal and expedite natural gas infrastructure projects in the U.S., respectively, and (3) the impact on renewable energy tax credits of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, as passed by the House of Representatives in May 2025 and now under Senate consideration.

2. EXECUTIVE ORDERS ON OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION:

On January 20, 2025, President Trump signed a series of EOs, three of which directly impact the oil and gas industry (the ""Oil/Gas EOs""). These are (i) Unleashing Alaska's Extraordinary Resource Potential, (ii) Unleashing American Energy, and (iii) Declaring a National Energy Emergency. Below is a summary of the key provisions of each Oil/Gas EO.

EO 141531 – Unleashing Alaska's Extraordinary Resource Potential: The first of these Oil/Gas EOs lifts restrictions on oil and gas development in Alaska imposed by the previous administration. Key measures include:

Reinstating leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) that had been canceled by the Biden Administration.

Opening additional areas in Alaska to oil and gas development.

Accelerating the permitting of infrastructure for Alaska's liquefied natural gas (""LNG"") export projects.

EO 141542 – Unleashing American Energy: This second Oil/Gas EO reverses provisions that sought to advance clean energy deployment included in past EOs issued during the Biden administration. These Biden-era orders are EO 14052 (Implementation of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (the ""Jobs Act"")) and EO 14082 (Implementation of the Energy and Infrastructure Provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the ""IRA"")). This Oil/Gas EO:

Directs federal agencies to pause the disbursement of funds under the Jobs Act and the IRA for various clean energy initiatives, including electric vehicle charging infrastructure.

Requires all federal agencies to identify and begin rolling back agency actions (including regulations, guidance, policies, and enforcement actions) that impose what the EO characterizes as ""undue burdens"" on the development of domestic energy resources, including oil, natural gas, coal, hydropower, biofuels, critical minerals, and nuclear energy.

Directs the Secretary of Energy to restart reviews of applications for approvals of LNG export projects as expeditiously as possible.

Directs the Administrator of the Maritime Administration to determine, within 30 days of the issuance of the EO, whether refinements to proposed deepwater LNG export ports are likely to result in adverse environmental consequences—thereby supporting favorable records of decision for these projects.

EO 141563 – Unleashing American Energy: The third Oil/Gas EO declares a national emergency related to energy production and authorizes broad emergency powers to increase domestic energy supply. To that end, it empowers the DOE to exercise emergency authority over energy production and distribution. Further, it requires agency coordination and seeks regulatory relief by directing all executive departments and agencies to, among other things, (i) take immediate steps to support domestic energy production, (ii) issue emergency waivers to bypass regulatory bottlenecks, and (iii) expedite permitting for projects on federal land.

3. EXECUTIVE ORDER ON COAL PRODUCTION:

On April 8, 2025, President Trump signed EO 14261,4 ""Reinvigorating America's Beautiful Clean Coal Industry and Amending Executive Order 14241,"" (the ""Coal EO""). The Coal EO is intended to support a shift from the previous administration's U.S. federal energy strategy by stating a policy that coal is essential to U.S. national and economic security and mobilizing federal agencies to support the coal industry. To that end, the Coal EO supports the increased mining and use of American coal as an energy source both to power artificial intelligence (AI) data centers and to revitalize the domestic manufacturing industry. The key provisions of the Coal EO are summarized below.

Removing Federal Regulatory Barriers for the Use of Coal: The Coal EO sets goals for federal agencies to remove financial and regulatory barriers to the mining and use of coal. To this end, the Coal EO requires such federal agencies to, among other things:

Revise or rescind any guidance, regulations, programs, and policies within their respective executive department or agency that seek to transition the U.S. away from coal production and electricity generation.

Bolster investment in coal production and coal-fired electricity generation through loan guarantees, grants, and equity investments by taking steps to rescind any policies or regulations that discourage investment in coal production and coal-fired electricity generation.

Identify coal-rich areas on federal lands, remove barriers to mining on federal lands and propose actions to prioritize coal leasing and expediting permits and environmental reviews related to such mining and leasing activities.

Reclassifying Coal as a Strategic National Asset: The Coal EO requires the Chair of the National Energy Dominance Council to reclassify coal as a ""mineral"" under the previous EO 14241. This reclassification entitles coal to federal support programs, including those under the DOE's loan authority and the Defense Production Act Fund.

Positioning Coal as an Important Energy Source for Developing Industries: The Coal EO requires the Secretary of the Interior, Secretary of Commerce, and the Secretary of Energy to identify regions of the country where coal-powered infrastructure is available and suitable for supporting AI data centers. The order also calls for accelerated development of coal technologies and commercial applications, including advanced manufacturing of coal-derived materials for batteries and construction.

4. DOE ACTIONS ON COAL PRODUCTION

Following the Coal EO issuance, the DOE took additional actions to promote the U.S. production of coal. On April 8, 2025, the DOE Secretary acted to:

Direct the DOE's Loan Program Office's Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment (EIR) Program to make available $200 billion of low-cost, long-term financing available to invest in energy infrastructure, including coal.

Direct the DOE to reinstate the National Coal Council, a 50-member body appointed by the Secretary that provides expert guidance on the future of coal technologies and markets, as a federal advisory committee.

Recommend, in coordination with the Department of the Interior, the designation of coal used in steelmaking as both a critical material and a critical mineral.

Direct the deployment of mineral extraction technology from coal ash by the DOE's National Energy Technology Laboratory.

Support commercialization efforts of coal ash conversion technologies through partnerships with DOE's National Laboratories and emerging companies.

Following these April orders, on May 23, 2025, the DOE Secretary designated coal used in steel production as a ""critical material"" under the Energy Act of 2020, aligning with President Trump's Coal EO.

The designation reflects the Trump Administration's efforts to have coal play an essential role in U.S. steelmaking, manufacturing, infrastructure, and energy security.

The DOE's analysis concluded that metallurgical coal meets the statutory criteria due to its unique properties and domestic supply chain vulnerabilities.

This designation is intended to strengthen the resilience of U.S. supply chains, support domestic industry, and reinforce steel's foundational role in sectors ranging from defense and transportation to energy.

5. EXECUTIVE ORDERS ON NUCLEAR PRODUCTION:

On May 23, 2025, President Trump signed four new EOs to encourage nuclear energy production (the ""Nuclear EOs""). These are (i) Ordering the Reform of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, (ii) Reforming Nuclear Reactor Testing at the Department of Energy, (iii) Reinvigorating the Nuclear Industrial Base, and (iv) an order focused on Nuclear Energy for National Security. The Nuclear EOs state a goal to quadruple U.S. nuclear power capacity by 2050. The key points of the Nuclear EOs are summarized below.

EO 143005 – Ordering the Reform of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission: The first of these Nuclear EOs directs the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (""NRC"") to work with other executive departments and agencies and undertake a review and wholesale revision of its regulations and guidance documents and issue notices of proposed rulemaking effecting this revision. Final rules and guidance to conclude this revision process are to be issued by November 2026. In particular, the NRC is expected to, among other things:

Establish fixed deadlines for its evaluation and approval of licenses, license amendments, license renewals, certificates of compliance, power uprates, license transfers, and any other activity requested by a licensee or potential licensee.

Adopt science-based radiation limits, including reconsidering its reliance on the ""as low as reasonably achievable"" standard, which is predicated on the linear no-threshold (LNT) model for radiation exposure.

Expedite the approval of reactor designs and establish a process for high-volume licensing of microreactors and modular reactors.

Establish stringent thresholds for demanding changes to reactor design once construction is underway and revise reactor security rules and requirements to reduce unnecessary burdens and be responsive to credible risks.

Streamline the public hearings process and reconsider the regulations to extend the period for which renewed licenses remain effective, based on available technological and safety data.

EO 143016 – Reforming Nuclear Reactor Testing at the Department of Energy: This second Nuclear EO seeks to reduce the NRC's role in deploying new reactor designs while increasing the DOE's role in this process. This order specifically directs the DOE to implement reforms to reactor testing processes, including:

Reforming the National Laboratory Process for reactor testing by requiring the Secretary of Energy to (i) within 60 days of the order, issue guidance regarding what counts as a qualified test reactor, (ii) within 90 days of the order, revise the regulations, guidance, and procedures and practices of the DOE to expedite the review, approval, and deployment of advanced reactors to two years following the submission of a substantially complete application, (iii) establish a team of representatives from the Secretary's office and other agencies to provide assistance to an applicant, ensuring expeditious processing of its application, and (iv) prioritize processing of qualified test reactor projects.

Creating a pilot program for reactor construction and operation outside the National Laboratories, pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act's authorization of reactors under the DOE's control and seek to approve at least three reactors pursuant to this pilot program with the goal of achieving criticality in each of the three reactors by July 4, 2026.

Reforming the DOE's rules governing compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) while seeking to eliminate or expedite the DOE's environmental reviews for authorizations, permits, approvals, leases, and any other activity requested by an applicant or potential applicant.

EO 143027 – Reinvigorating the Nuclear Industrial Base: Under this Nuclear EO, the Trump Administration is seeking to strengthen the U.S. domestic nuclear fuel supply chain in connection with energy independence goals, national security policy and advanced reactor deployment. This would be done by improving fuel cycle infrastructure, including uranium enrichment and conversion, as well as waste recycling and disposal infrastructure. This Nuclear EO directs the DOE to, among other things:

Prioritize work with the nuclear energy industry to facilitate five gigawatt of power uprates to existing nuclear reactors and have ten new large reactors with complete designs under construction by 2030.

Coordinate with the Secretary of Defense to assess the feasibility of restarting or repurposing closed nuclear power plants as energy hubs for military microgrid support.

Prioritize funding for qualified advanced nuclear technologies through grants, loans, investment capital, and funding opportunities in coordination with the Administrator of the Small Business Administration.

Support education pathways by taking steps to increase access to research and development infrastructure, workforce, and expertise at Department of Energy National Laboratories for college and university students studying nuclear engineering and other nuclear energy-related fields.

EO 142998 – Deploying Advanced Nuclear Reactor Technologies for National Security: This Nuclear EO aims to leverage the U.S. military's energy needs to deploy new reactor technologies and to facilitate exports of U.S.-developed nuclear technologies abroad. To this end, this Nuclear EO provides for the federal government to support the rapid growth of advanced nuclear technologies domestically and for export to U.S. allies and commercial partners. Among other things, the Secretary of Energy is directed to:

No later than September 30, 2028, commence the operation of a nuclear reactor, regulated by the United States Army, at a domestic military base or installation.

Designate one or more sites owned or controlled by the DOE, including national laboratories, for the use and deployment of advanced nuclear reactor technologies.

Site, approve, and authorize the design, construction, and operation of privately funded:

advanced nuclear reactor technologies at DOE-owned or controlled sites for the purpose of powering AI infrastructure, other critical or national security needs, supply chain items, or on-site infrastructure; and

nuclear fuel recycling, reprocessing, and reactor fuel fabrication technologies.

6. THE ONE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL ACT

In contrast with orders and other actions by the U.S. executive branch, legislative action is underway to reduce or terminate the tax credits for energy sources known as clean, renewable, or sustainable. On May 22, 2025, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the ""Beautiful Bill""), which proposes to significantly alter current tax credits made available under the IRA for these energy sources. This proposed legislation would terminate, reduce the period of availability, or accelerate the phase out of a number of tax credits. These include:

Section 45Y (Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit): Terminate the Section 45Y tax credit for any qualified facility that either (i) begins construction more than 60 days after the date of the enactment of the Act or (ii) that is placed in service after December 31, 2028. Certain advanced nuclear facilities that begin construction prior to January 1, 2029, will remain eligible for this tax credit.

Section 48E (Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit): Terminate the Section 48E tax credit for any qualified facility that either (i) begins construction more than 60 days after the date of the enactment of the Beautiful Bill or (ii) that is placed in service after December 31, 2028. Certain advanced nuclear facilities that begins construction prior to January 1, 2029, will remain eligible for this tax credit.

Section 45U (Zero-Emission Nuclear Power Production Credit): Accelerate the phaseout schedule for the tax credit under this section one year earlier than current law, by December 31, 2031, instead of 2032.

Section 45V (Credit for Production of Clean Hydrogen): Terminate the tax credit under this section seven years earlier than current law, by January 1, 2026, instead of 2033, for facilities that begin construction after December 31, 2025.

Section 45X (Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit): Existing credit for wind energy components under this provision would be terminated for components sold after December 31, 2027, accelerating such termination by five years.

Section 45Z (Clean Fuel Production Credit): Accelerates the termination of the existing credit for transportation fuel under this provision for fuel sold after December 31, 2025, except that termination of the credit for fuel produced from feedstock that is produced or grown in the U.S., Mexico, or Canada would be extended to December 31, 2031.

The Beautiful Bill also proposes to eliminate the transferability of various credits, including Section 45Q (Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit), Section 48 Investment Tax Credit (with respect to geothermal), Section 45U Zero-Emission Nuclear Power Production Credit, Section 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit, and Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit.

7. FERC9 ACTIONS

On June 18, 2025, FERC took action to speed up the construction of natural gas infrastructure projects in the U.S. In support of these actions, FERC Chairman Mark Christie said that ""new and expanded natural gas infrastructure is essential to help America avoid a grid reliability crisis."" This was done by FERC's temporarily waiving two existing FERC rules that served to limit initial construction activities for natural gas facilities and issuing notices proposing permanent changes to those limits.

The FERC actions include:

Docket CP25-499-000: In this proceeding, FERC (i) granted a one-year waiver of FERC's Order No. 871 and (ii) issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing to remove the rule issued through Order No. 871 from FERC's regulations. FERC's Order No. 871 precluded the issuance of authorizations to proceed with construction activities for natural gas facilities while certain requests for rehearing are pending before FERC.

Docket CP25-208-000: In this proceeding, FERC (i) granted a two-year temporary waiver increasing blanket certificate cost limitations to expand certain activities a natural gas company may undertake without the need to obtain a case-specific certificate and (ii) issued a Notice of Inquiry seeking comment on permanently adjusting the blanket certificate cost limitations.

8. CONCLUSION

The recent executive actions signal a commitment by the federal government under the Trump Administration to advancing oil, gas, coal and nuclear energy. The administration's directives to expand domestic production, reduce regulatory barriers, invest in infrastructure, and accelerate deployment timelines suggest a favorable environment for oil, gas, coal and nuclear development in the near term. If these policies are implemented as intended, these energy sectors may see expanded federal support, increased private investment, and a broader role in meeting both industrial and national security energy demands.

In contrast, the future of renewable energy tax incentives remains uncertain. The Beautiful Bill must still pass the Senate and be signed into law before taking effect, and it is unclear whether its proposed provisions will be enacted in their current form. As of the date of this Client Alert, the Senate has already proposed a number of significant changes that would reduce the impact on renewable energy.

The full impact of the administration's energy-focused EOs will depend on how federal agencies implement them and whether they withstand potential legal and political challenges. The overall direction of U.S. energy policy remains in flux.

MVA remains watchful of new developments in the U.S. energy policy and anyone seeking more information on the topics discussed in this alert should reach out to their MVA attorney or the authors of this alert.

President Trump is getting the Independence Day signing ceremony he's been demanding.

MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:

This is for the megabill he and Republicans in Congress pushed over the finish line yesterday afternoon. Speaking under the wing of Air Force One as he departed for a victory rally in Iowa, Trump said the celebration would include a military aircraft flyover.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And it's going to be a great day. So we'll be signing with those beautiful planes flying right over our heads.

MARTIN: The One Big Beautiful Bill, as President Trump has been calling it, contains the president's entire domestic legislative agenda.

MARTÍNEZ: With more, we're joined now by NPR senior White House correspondent Tamara Keith. So, Tam, what is the president saying about this bill's passage?

TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Well, as you might imagine, he and his allies are taking a victory lap. Trump was in Iowa last night for a rally and said with this bill, he kept every major promise he made to voters when he ran for office last year.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

TRUMP: Very simply, the One Big Beautiful Bill will deliver the strongest border on earth, the strongest economy on earth, the strongest military on earth, and ensure the United States of America will remain the strongest country anywhere on this beautiful planet of ours.

(CHEERING)

KEITH: Trump was, to borrow a word he likes to use, rather braggadocious about his success last night, asking, has anybody ever had a better two weeks?

MARTÍNEZ: Now, 48 hours ago, though, there was some drama. I mean, it looked like that bill and the president's timeline were in trouble. So what happened?

KEITH: Well, there were quite a few Republican holdouts, but President Trump turned on the charm, and then he turned up the pressure. And ultimately, all but two Republicans in the House who had been holding out folded. At a press conference after the bill passed, Majority Leader Steve Scalise gave Trump all the credit.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

STEVE SCALISE: Donald Trump absolutely was our closer, and Donald Trump never stopped - every day was there in the fight. Who do I need to call? What do I need to do? No president more directly engaged.

KEITH: This was a pivotal moment in Trump's presidency and he and his party rose to it. It took all-night debates and arm-twisting and passed with incredibly narrow margins in both the House and the Senate. And the question now is whether it becomes a long-term political win or more of an albatross.

MARTÍNEZ: Oh, OK. Sounds like you're talking about the midterm elections.

KEITH: Indeed. Next year, Republicans in swing districts will have to defend their votes. And so far, public polling has found this bill to be pretty unpopular. Democrats have had a lot of success in branding it as a tax cut for the rich at the expense of the poor and the vulnerable. A senior White House official conceded in a call yesterday with reporters that the president and Republicans are going to have to educate the public on what's actually in the bill, including things that are popular, like no tax on tips or expanding the child tax credit.

And another thing to watch is the Medicaid cuts in the bill, which an independent analysis found would cause nearly 12 million people to lose coverage. Those will phase in more slowly, which may give Republicans some political cover because people often don't draw a direct line between things happening in their lives and something politicians in Washington passed years earlier.

MARTÍNEZ: Yeah. Now, still a lot of uncertainty, though, various global conflicts, the U.S. tariff policy. What challenges lie ahead, though?

KEITH: Well, it depends on how you feel about tariffs. Early next week, Trump's tariff pause is set to end and his administration has not had much success striking trade deals. So he says he's just going to start sending letters to countries telling them how high their tariffs will be going forward. Economists say tariffs are going to hit American consumers, but Trump is unconcerned.

Trump is also burning up the phones to various world leaders, trying to wind down the conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine, and then there's Iran - all of which is to say, a president's work is never done.

Market Impact: Short-Term Overdraft and Long-Term Downward Pressure Increase 1.","On July 3, 2025, the US House of Representatives passed a comprehensive tax and spending reform bill (The One, Big, Beautiful Bill) led by President Trump. The bill's content is extensive, with significant adjustments to the EV subsidy mechanism drawing widespread market attention.The $7,500 federal tax credit for new cars and the $4,000 credit for used cars will officially terminate on September 30, which is expected to have a profound impact on the US NEV market. This article attempts to explore the impact of this policy shift on the US NEV industry from the perspective of policy changes, combined with market structure and corporate strategies, and to sort out the deeper game relationship between the Trump administration and Musk.

I. Policy Changes: Subsidy Withdrawal and Cost Increase

The EV-related provisions of this bill mainly include three aspects:

1. Termination of Federal Tax Credits:

The original $7,500 subsidy for new cars and $4,000 subsidy for used cars will expire on September 30, 2025. These two subsidies, implemented since 2008 and optimized by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in 2023, have played a crucial role in boosting EV sales, especially accounting for a high proportion in the price range of $30,000–$60,000. The original Inflation Reduction Act planned to cancel the tax credit policy for EVs only by the end of 2032.

2. New Registration Fees:

The bill stipulates that EVs will be subject to a $250 registration fee, while hybrid vehicles will be subject to a $100 fee. The rationale for this fee is to make up for the shortfall in the Highway Trust Fund caused by EVs not paying gasoline taxes.

3. Other Unconfirmed Provisions:

Early versions of the bill proposed restricting the eligibility of products using batteries made in China and allowing companies with sales below 200,000 units to continue enjoying subsidies during the transition period. However, whether these provisions will be included in the final version remains to be announced.

Overall, this round of policy adjustments aims to weaken the fiscal incentive foundation for EVs while restoring ""parity"" in road usage costs between internal combustion engine vehicles and EVs through a fee mechanism.

II. Market Impact: Short-Term Overdraft and Long-Term Downward Pressure Increase

1. Consumer Side: Subsidy Window Drives Short-Term Buying Frenzy

Before the subsidy expiration date is confirmed, some consumers will choose to purchase cars ahead of time to lock in the existing policy benefits. Organizations like Plug In America predict that there may be a wave of panic buying this summer, particularly concentrated within the mainstream EV price range (approximately $40,000–$60,000). However, it is worth noting that this concentrated consumption will deplete subsequent demand in the short term, and it is highly probable that NEV sales in the US will experience a significant decline starting from October. For middle- and low-income groups, the impact of rising car purchase costs is particularly pronounced.

2. Supply side: Tesla still has buffering capacity, while risks for startups rise

Tesla's brand recognition, capacity efficiency, and global layout help partially offset the impact of the withdrawal of local subsidies, and it may adjust through measures such as price reductions and financing lease plans. For emerging companies (such as Rivian, Lucid, etc.) that rely on subsidies to boost sales, the loss of subsidies may directly affect their profitability expectations and financing capabilities.Regarding traditional automakers , some brands may take this opportunity to adjust the pace of electrification and return to a product mix of internal combustion engine vehicles and hybrid vehicles to adapt to changes in the policy environment.

III. Political Motivations and Gameplay: Differences between the Trump Administration and Musk

Despite Musk's support for the Republican Party on some issues in recent years, he has substantial differences with the Trump Administration on issues such as the development path of EVs, energy policy, and the relationship between federal and local powers.

1. Differences in policy concepts

Issue Trump Administration Musk/Tesla Energy structure Tends to support traditional energy sources and internal combustion engine vehicles Promotes renewable energy and electrification of transportation Consumer choice Advocates for retaining the freedom to choose internal combustion engine vehicles Advocates for a comprehensive transition to EVs State government power Restricts states like California from implementing zero-emission policies Benefits from local EV promotion policies

The Trump Administration has consistently opposed ""favoring"" EVs in policies, advocating for returning market choice to consumers and eliminating the tendency towards forced transformation. Legislative attempts by California to set a proportion for pure EV sales may also face federal-level restrictions under the new bill.

2. Redistribution of policy tools

The cancellation of federal-level EV incentives does not prevent some state governments from continuing to promote the transition through local tax incentives, charging subsidies, etc., but the space for policy benefits has been significantly compressed. For automakers relying on a nationwide incentive system, relying solely on local support is difficult to maintain the existing pace of capacity expansion.

IV. Market Adjustment and Structural Reconfiguration Under the US Policy Cycle

The implementation of the ""Big and Beautiful Act"" led by Trump represents a sharp turn in the policy logic of the US new energy vehicle (NEV) market. From the initiation of subsidies in 2008 to the escalation of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in 2023, and now to an abrupt halt, this dramatic swing not only reflects the divergence between the two US political parties on the industrial path but also exposes the risks of ""policy dependency"" in the new energy transition.

For the market, the most direct impact will be the pain following short-term supply-demand imbalance. After the ""Electric Summer"" buying frenzy subsides, a decline in sales from October onwards is almost inevitable—especially for car models priced between $30,000 and $50,000, which heavily rely on subsidies to drive consumption, with sales potentially dropping by over 20%. Middle- and low-income families will be forced out of the new energy market, reverting EVs to being ""exclusive to the middle class,"" which contradicts the US's long-term goal of promoting transportation emissions reduction.

Differentiation at the enterprise level will accelerate. Tesla, leveraging its large-scale production and brand premium, can absorb subsidy losses through price cuts of 5%-8%, but its profit margins may shrink to below 15%. Money-burning enterprises like Rivian and Lucid face a heightened risk of cash flow disruption if they cannot secure financing by the end of September, potentially leading to an industry reshuffle earlier than expected. Traditional automakers will adopt a more pragmatic strategy: Ford and General Motors may scale back production capacity for electric pickup trucks and instead increase investment in hybrid vehicles; European brands like Stellantis may redirect resources from the US market to regions with more lenient policies, such as Latin America.

The deeper impact of this policy withdrawal lies in reshaping the cost logic of the global new energy industry chain. The US attempts to force enterprises to ""de-policyize"" their survival by canceling subsidies, but this requires cost control capabilities across the entire industry chain—currently, the US still relies on imports in areas such as battery raw material processing and core components for motor and electronic control, making it difficult to achieve complete self-sufficiency in the short term. If the provisions in the bill restricting Chinese batteries are retained, local automakers' battery procurement costs may rise by 10%-15%, weakening their competitiveness instead.

In the long run, the US NEV market will enter a phase of overlapping ""policy vacuum"" and ""technological ramp-up."" The withdrawal of subsidies forces enterprises to focus on improving battery energy density, optimizing charging networks, and other hard capabilities, but policy uncertainty may slow down the pace of capital investment. In contrast, China maintains policy continuity through stepped subsidy withdrawals, while Europe constructs long-term mechanisms relying on carbon tariffs. The authority to set rules in the global new energy competition is undergoing a subtle shift.

Ultimately, Trump's bill may bring short-term revenue to the Highway Trust Fund, but at the cost of sacrificing the growth momentum of the new energy vehicle market. Industrial transformation has never been a simple matter of adding or subtracting policies. When the US cuts off subsidy dependence with a ""shock therapy"" approach, whether it can complete the transformation driven by the spontaneous forces of the market will become an important case to test the resilience of the global new energy industry—and the answer may not be revealed until automakers' financial reports in 2026.",https://static.metal.com/common.metal.com/images/header-en/smm-logo.png,N,,2025-07-04 16:10:09.263892

Financing was provided by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Lloyds Bank.
Recently, BSR submitted a planning application for a 15MW solar farm near Maidstone, Kent.
The proposed Harp Farm Solar Park would span 76 acres and include biodiversity measures such as wildflower meadows and nesting boxes for bats, birds, and dormice.
Additionally, BSR secured planning approval for four UK solar projects in 2024 including, the 21MWp Park Farm and Town Farm Solar Parks in Suffolk, the 19MW Dengie Solar Park in Essex and the 49.9MW Knowl Green Solar Park, also in Essex.","Clean energy developer British Solar Renewables (BSR) has secured a £345 million debt facility for 609MW of 12 solar and co-located solar and battery energy storage system (BESS) projects.

Once operational, the 12 projects were set to generate 600GWh of clean electricity each year. This will support the UK’s push towards its 2050 net zero target and address ongoing energy security concerns.

Branding this as a “landmark transaction,” Michael Ozersky, chief investment officer of BSR, said that this financing highlights the “strength of BSR’s co-location strategy.”

BSR secured a £345 million senior structured debt facility in its second major financing round. The deal was backed by a consortium of lenders, including Lloyds, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), Landesbank Baden-Württemberg (LBBW) and NatWest.

Bracewell LLP served as legal advisor to BSR for the financing transaction, while Lloyds acted as the sole structuring bank for the transaction. Tony Hable, managing director at Lloyds, said that this second successful portfolio financing will support the firm’s ambitious growth targets.

In June last year, BSR closed its first portfolio financing round for a five-project portfolio across the UK and Australia. The sites collectively aim to generate 132GWh of solar power annually. Financing was provided by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Lloyds Bank.

The company has set a bold target to develop 7,000MW of renewable capacity by 2027. Recently, BSR submitted a planning application for a 15MW solar farm near Maidstone, Kent. The proposed Harp Farm Solar Park would span 76 acres and include biodiversity measures such as wildflower meadows and nesting boxes for bats, birds, and dormice. If approved, it aimed to deliver a minimum 60% biodiversity net gain and be restored after a 40-year lifespan.

Moreover, BSR launched a community consultation for its proposed Hooton Pagnell Renewable Park near Doncaster in June 2025. The project, planned to span 94 hectares in South Yorkshire, features a 49.9MW solar PV plant and a 30MW battery storage system. It aims to support local energy resilience and sustainability goals.

Additionally, BSR secured planning approval for four UK solar projects in 2024 including, the 21MWp Park Farm and Town Farm Solar Parks in Suffolk, the 19MW Dengie Solar Park in Essex and the 49.9MW Knowl Green Solar Park, also in Essex.",https://www.solarpowerportal.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/bsr-two.jpg,N,,2025-07-04 15:12:46.033129

Property that would be ""energy property"" as defined in section 48 would no longer be listed as 5-year MACRS property under Section 168.
§45V – Clean Hydrogen Production Credit This credit would be terminated for facilities that begin construction after Dec. 31, 2027.
§48 – Energy Credit The 2% energy credit would terminate for any energy property beginning construction after June 16, 2025.
FEOC Restrictions: A ""prohibited foreign entity"" is either (i) a specified foreign entity or (ii) a foreign-influenced entity.","Update: The House of Representatives passed (by a vote of 218-214) the budget reconciliation bill (H.R. 1, the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"") on July 3, 2025. The bill now goes to the President for signature.

On July 1, 2025, the Senate passed (by a vote of 51-50) its version of the budget reconciliation bill containing numerous tax reform provisions. Below are our summaries of the proposed amendments to certain tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (""IRA"") as well as our initial observations.

The focus of the updates in the bill are as follows:

Special rules would apply to wind and solar, including (i) a placed in service deadline of Dec. 31, 2027, for facilities beginning construction after 1 year from enactment, (ii) removal of ""energy property"" under section 48 from 5-year MACRS depreciation, and (iii) amendments to the applicable domestic content percentages under section 48E;

Enhanced foreign entity of concern (FEOC) restrictions, including (i) application of the ""material assistance"" rules to wind and solar facilities beginning construction after Dec. 31, 2025, (ii) extending the period for assessment to 6 years for a deficiency attributable to an error in the determination of ""material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity"", and (iii) introducing accuracy-related penalties for understatements of income tax by more than 1% due to overstating the ""material assistance cost ratio"" of property qualifying for credits under sections 45X, 45Y, or 48E;

Codification of the beginning of construction rules in IRS Notices 2013-29 and 2018-59 (as well as any subsequently issued guidance clarifying, modifying, or updating either Notice), as in effect on Jan. 1, 2025, for purposes of the FEOC requirements;

""Metallurgical coal"" would be eligible for the advanced manufacturing production credit under section 45X in tax years beginning after enactment and until Dec. 31, 2029; and

Clean hydrogen production facilities beginning construction before Jan. 1, 2028, would remain eligible for credits under section 45V, with no applicable FEOC requirements.

Reference Guide for Amendments to IRA Tax Credits in the Budget Bill:

Observation: Projects seeking tax credits under sections 45 and 48 are generally unaffected by the bill, except as described below with respect to the termination of 2% energy credit. To be eligible for tax credits under sections 45 or 48, a project (except for ground or groundwater thermal systems, as described below) must have begun construction before Jan. 1, 2025, and generally be placed in service within 4 years (or 10 years in the case of offshore wind) after in year in which construction begun.

§168 – Accelerated Cost Recovery System (Depreciation)

Section 45Y and 48E property would continue to be listed as 5-year MACRS property under section 168.

Property that would be ""energy property"" as defined in section 48 would no longer be listed as 5-year MACRS property under Section 168.

Observation: Without a specific indication to the contrary, there are arguments that such property would continue to be subject to the MACRS rules/guidance, which include general rules regarding the determination of MACRS class lives (such as Rev. Proc. 87-56).

Alternatively, taxpayers would appear to be able to elect the alternative depreciation system and apply 12-year, straight-line recovery under section 168(g).

45Y – Clean Electricity Production Credit & §48E – Clean Electricity Investment Credit

Placed in Service Deadline for Wind and Solar: Credits would terminate for wind and solar facilities that begin construction after 1 year from enactment and are not placed in service before Jan. 1, 2028—facilities that begin construction within 1 year from enactment would not be subject to the placed in service deadline.

Phase-Out for other technologies: All technology other than wind and solar would phase out after 2032 as follows:

100% credit for facilities beginning construction during 2033;

75% credit for facilities beginning construction during 2034;

50% credit for facilities beginning construction during 2035; and

0% credit for facilities beginning construction after Dec. 31, 2035.

Observation: The version of the bill that initially passed the House included deadlines based on beginning construction (within 60 days of enactment) and being placed in service (by Dec. 31, 2028). The Senate Finance Committee's version of the bill included a modified phaseout for wind and solar based on beginning construction by Dec. 31, 2027, however that proposal was then replaced with a placed in service deadline of Dec. 31, 2027 for projects beginning construction one year after enactment.

Observation: The accelerated timeline for wind and solar projects to be placed in service (as compared to the phase out for other technologies) presents additional challenges for developers faced with construction and supply uncertainty and potential inability to control the timing for when their facilities can be placed in service.

FEOC restrictions would disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" or a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (without regard to ""effective control"") for tax years beginning after enactment;

Taxpayers whose facilities are determined to be under ""effective control"" by a ""specified foreign entity"" in tax years beginning after enactment; and

Facilities that begin construction after Dec. 31, 2025, and include ""material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity"".

Observation: Requiring that ""effective control"" be ""determined"", in this context, implies that the determination will be made during post-filing examination and enforcement.

Special ITC Recapture Rule: 100% of ITCs claimed under section 48E with respect to a property would be recaptured if a ""specified taxpayer"" (i.e., one who is allowed an ITC for any tax year beginning 2 years after enactment) makes an ""applicable payment"" within 10 years after the property is placed in service.

Transferability would continue to be available for the duration of the credit period.

Special Rule for Residential Property: No credit would be allowed for residential solar water heating property or small wind energy property if the taxpayer/owner rents or leases such property to a third party.

Observation: Projects subject to PPAs and other property (such as battery storage projects) apparently would not be subject to the rule above.

Observation: Under the bill, residential solar electric property would not be subject to the rule above. Therefore, residential solar electric property leased to customers would still be eligible for section 45Y or 48E credits provided that other credit eligibility requirements are satisfied.

Observation: Residential projects that can demonstrate that they began construction in 2024 would qualify for the ITC under section 48.

Nuclear Energy Communities: Advanced nuclear facilities located in a metropolitan statistical area that has (or at any time after Dec. 31, 2009 has had) 0.17% of greater direct employment related to advanced nuclear power would be eligible for the energy community bonus credit amount for PTCs under section 45Y (but not for ITCs under section 48E).

Correction to Domestic Content Percentages Under 48E: The domestic content applicable percentage under 48E for qualified facilities and energy storage technology would be revised to match current 45Y as follows:

40% (or 20% for offshore wind) if construction begins before June 16, 2025;

45% (or 27.5% for offshore wind) if construction begins after June 16, 2025, and before Jan. 1, 2026;

50% (or 35% for offshore wind) if construction begins during 2026; and

55% if construction begins after Dec. 31, 2026.

Special Rules for Fuel Cell Property: For qualified fuel cell property that begins construction after Dec. 31, 2025, the credit rate would be fixed at 30% and could not be increased or otherwise adjusted, and the zero GHG emissions requirement and recapture rule for GHG emissions greater than 10 grams of C02e per KWh would not apply.

Observation: The fixed 30% ITC rate for fuel cell property suggests that PWA compliance would no longer be necessary to qualify for the full ITC rate, however the ITC rate could not be increased through bonus credit amounts for energy community or domestic content or otherwise.

§45Q – Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit

Parity of Credit Rate: For facilities placed in service after enactment, the credit amount would be the same regardless of whether the taxpayer merely disposed of the captured carbon oxide or undertakes use or utilization of the captured carbon oxide, as follows:

$17 ($36 for direct air capture) for tax years beginning in a calendar year after 2024 and before 2027 (indexed for 2025-inflation for any taxable year beginning in a calendar year after 2026)

FEOC restrictions would disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" or a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (without regard to ""effective control"") for tax years beginning after enactment.

§45U – Clean Electricity Production (For Existing Nuclear Facilities)

The credit would terminate for electricity produced and sold after Dec. 31, 2032.

FEOC restrictions would disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" for tax years beginning after enactment;

Taxpayers who are a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (without regard to ""effective control"") in tax years beginning 2 years after enactment; and

Transferability would continue to be available for the duration of the credit period.

§45V – Clean Hydrogen Production Credit

This credit would be terminated for facilities that begin construction after Dec. 31, 2027.

Observation: The FEOC restrictions apparently would not apply to section 45V.

§45X – Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit

Except as noted below, the credit rate would phase out under the current schedule based on the date the eligible components are sold:

Before Jan. 1, 2030: 100%;

During 2030: 75%;

During 2031: 50%;

During 2032: 25%;

After Dec. 31, 2032: 0%.

Wind energy components produced and sold after December 31, 2027, would not be credit eligible.

For critical minerals other than metallurgical coal, the credit rate would phase out as follows based on the date the critical minerals are produced:

Before Jan. 1, 2031: 100%;

During 2031: 75%;

During 2032: 50%;

During 2033: 25%;

After Dec. 31, 2033: 0%.

Inclusion of Metallurgical Coal as a Critical Mineral: Metallurgical coal that is suitable for use in the production of steel (within the meaning of the Department of Energy notice ""Critical Mineral List; Addition of Metallurgical Coal Used for Steelmaking"" (90 Fed. Reg. 22711 (May 29, 2025))) would be credit-eligible at a rate of 2.5% of the costs incurred by the taxpayer with respect to production, regardless of whether such production occurs inside or outside of the United States.

Metallurgical coal produced after Dec. 31, 2029, would not be credit eligible.

Observation: Under section 45X(d)(2) (not modified by the bill), sales are taken into account for section 45X credits only when production of eligible components is within the United States (or its possession). It remains to be seen whether this provision effectively requires the production of metallurgical coal to be within the United States to be credit-eligible.

FEOC restrictions would disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" or a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (without regard to ""effective control"") for tax years beginning after enactment;

Taxpayers who are determined to have produced eligible components through ""effective control"" by a ""specified foreign entity"" in tax years beginning after enactment; and

Eligible components produced in tax years beginning after enactment that include any ""material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity"".

Additional Requirement for Battery Modules: To be credit-eligible, battery modules would be required to be comprised of all other essential equipment needed for battery functionality, such as current collector assemblies and voltage sense harnesses, or any other essential energy collection equipment.

Sale of Integrated Components: For tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2026, sales of integrated components would remain credit-eligible only if the ""primary component"" is integrated, incorporated, or assembled into a ""secondary component"" (i) that is produced within the same manufacturing facility as the primary component, (ii) that is sold to an unrelated person, and (iii) for which not less than 65% of the total direct material costs are attributable to primary components which are mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States.

Observation: Taxpayers could still elect to treat a sale of components to a related person as being made to an unrelated person.

§45Z – Clean Fuel Production Credit

The credit period would be extended until Dec. 31, 2029 (based on when the fuel is sold).

Fuel produced after December 31, 2025, would be required to be exclusively derived from feedstock produced or grown in the United States, Mexico, or Canada.

Transportation fuel emissions rates published after Dec. 31, 2025, could not be less than zero.

Lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions would exclude any emissions attributed to indirect land use charge, and distinct emissions rates would be provided for transportation fuels derived from animal manure, including dairy, swine, and poultry.

Prevention of Double Credit: fuel produced from a fuel that generated a credit under section 45Z would not be credit eligible, and Treasury would be authorized to issue guidance on preventing the doubling of 45Z credits.

Sales to Unrelated Persons: Treasury would be authorized to prescribe rules for related persons whom the taxpayer has reason to believe will sell fuel to an unrelated person.

Special Rules for Sustainable Aviation Fuel:

For fuel sold or used on or after enactment (and fuel sold or used before enactment that have not yet been allowed or paid a credit under section 6426(k)), the sustainable aviation fuel credit under section 6426(k) would not be allowed for any gallon of fuel that could receive a credit under section 45Z.

For fuel produced after Dec. 31, 2025, the increased credit rate for SAF would not apply.

The sustainable aviation fuel credit under section 6426(k) would not apply to any sale or use for any period after September 30, 2025.

Small Agri-Biodiesel Producer Credit: For fuel sold or used after June 30, 2025:

The small agri-biodiesel producer credit under section 40A would be extended to sale or use on or before Dec. 31, 2026;

The credit amount would be increased from $0.10 to $0.20 per gallon of qualified agri-biodiesel production, and would be in addition to any credit determined under section 45Z with respect to such gallon of fuel;

The small agri-biodiesel producer credit could be transferred pursuant to section 6418; and

Eligible small agri-biodiesel producers would be required to be exclusively derived from feedstock produced or grown in the United States, Mexico, or Canada.

FEOC restrictions would disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" for tax years beginning after enactment; and

Taxpayers who are a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (without regard to ""effective control"") for tax years beginning 2 years after enactment.

§48 – Energy Credit

The 2% energy credit would terminate for any energy property beginning construction after June 16, 2025.

Observation: For projects beginning construction on or after Jan. 1, 2025, only ground or groundwater thermal systems remain eligible for the 6% energy credit, because other energy property eligible for a 6% energy credit (including fuel cells, solar, geothermal, small wind property, waste energy recovery property, energy storage technology, biogas property, microgrid controllers, and combined heat and power property) converted to the ""tech-neutral"" ITC under section 48E.

§48C – Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Credit

Upon enactment, allocations revoked for failure to place the project in service within 2 years from the date of certification would not be restored to the total amount of allocations under the program.

§6418 – Transfer of Certain Credits

The bill does not include a deadline with respect to the transfer of credits; however, transfers of credits under 45Q, 45U, 45X, 45Y, 45Z, or 48E to a ""specified foreign entity"" would be prohibited.

Observation: The preservation of transferability is undermined by the accelerated expiration of the credits themselves.

Observation: Additional FEOC requirements would apply to credits under sections 45Y,48E, and 45X that would not apply to credits under sections 45U, 45Q, 45Z, and 48.

FEOC Restrictions:

A ""prohibited foreign entity"" is either (i) a specified foreign entity or (ii) a foreign-influenced entity.

""Specified foreign entities"" include:

entities designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the Secretary of State;17

entities included on the specially designated nationals and blocked persons list maintained by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control;18

entities alleged by the Attorney General to have engaged in conduct for which a conviction was obtained under certain laws;

entities determined by the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the Director of National Intelligence, to be engaged in unauthorized conduct that is detrimental to U.S national security or foreign policy;19

Chinese military company operating in the United States;20

entities Listed Under the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act21; or

certain battery producing entities.22

Specified foreign entities include ""foreign controlled entities"" such as (i) the government of a covered nation (e.g., China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea), (ii) an agency or instrumentality of a government of a covered nation, (iii) a citizen or national of a covered nation without U.S. status as a citizen, national or lawful permanent resident, (iv) an entity organized under the laws of, or having its principal place of business in, a covered nation, or (v) an entity controlled by any of the above, including subsidiaries, measured by more than 50% ownership of stock in a corporation, profits interests or capital interests in a partnership, or other beneficial interest in the entity (under the section 318 attribution rules).

There would be an exception for publicly traded entities, except that (i) any exchange or market which is incorporated or organized under the laws of a covered nation or has its principal place of business in a covered nation is excluded from the definition of exchange or market for this purpose, and (ii) such entity shall still be deemed to be a foreign-controlled entity if 1 or more specified foreign entities or foreign-controlled entities controls more than 50%.

An entity is a ""foreign-influenced entity"" if:

(i) During the taxable year:

A specified foreign entity has direct or indirect authority to appoint a board member, executive officer, or similar individual;

A single specified foreign entity owns at least 25% of the entity;

One or more specified foreign entities own in the aggregate at least 40% of the entity; or

At least 15% of the entity's debt is held in the aggregate by one or more specified foreign entities; or

(ii) During the prior taxable year, the entity made an ""applicable payment"" to a specified foreign entity pursuant to a contract, agreement, or other arrangement which entitles the specified foreign entity (or a related entity) to exercise ""effective control"" over (i) any qualified facility or energy storage technology of the taxpayer (or any related person) or (ii) the extraction, processing, or recycling of any applicable critical mineral or production of an eligible component by the taxpayer (or any related person):

""Effective control"" generally would mean 1 or more agreements or arrangements which provide 1 or more contractual counterparties (or related person) of a taxpayer with specific authority over key aspects of the production of eligible components, energy generation, or energy storage which are not included in the measures of control through authority, ownership, or debt held.

Until FEOC guidance is issued, ""effective control"" would mean the unrestricted contractual right of a contractual counterparty to make certain major decisions for the taxpayer (including any related party to the taxpayer), such as (i) determine the quantity or timing of production of an eligible components, (ii) determine the amount or timing of activities related to the production of electricity or the storage or electrical energy, (iii) determine which entity may purchase or use the output of a production unit, (iv) determine which entity may purchase or use the output of a qualified facility, (v) restrict access to data critical to production or storage of energy, or to the site of production or any part of a qualified facility or energy storage technology of the taxpayer, to the personnel or agents of such contractual counterparty, or (vi) on an exclusive basis, maintain, repair, or operate any plant or equipment which is necessary to the production of eligible components or electricity.

With respect to a licensing agreement entered into with a contractual counterparty (or related person), ""effective control"" would also mean a contractual right to (i) specify or otherwise direct 1 or more sources of components, subcomponents, or applicable critical minerals, (ii) direct the operation, (iii) limit the taxpayer's utilization of intellectual property, (iv) receive royalties under the licensing agreement or any similar arrangement (or payments under any related agreement) beyond the 10th year of the agreement (including modifications or extensions), (v) direct or otherwise require the taxpayer (or any related party) to enter into an agreement for the provision of services for a duration longer than 2 years (including any modifications or extensions), or the contract, agreement, or other arrangement (vi) does not provide the licensee with all the technical data, information, and know-how necessary to enable the licensee to produce the eligible component or components subject to the contract, agreement, or other arrangement without further involvement from the contractual counterparty (or related person) or a specified foreign entity, or (vii) was entered into (or modified) on or after the date of enactment.

There would be an exception for a bona fide purchase or sale of intellectual property. However, a bona fide purchase or sale would not include any purchase or sale of intellectual property where the agreement provides that ownership of the intellectual property reverts to the contractual counterparty after a period of time.

There would be an exception for publicly traded entities, except such entity shall still be deemed to be a foreign-influenced entity if (i) a specified foreign entity has the authority to appoint a covered officer, (ii) a single specified foreign entity owns not less than 25% of the publicly traded entity, (iii) 1 or more specified foreign entities own in the aggregate not less than 40% of the publicly traded entity, or (iv) debt in excess of 15% of the publicly traded debt of the publicly traded entity has been issued to 1 or more specified foreign entities.

Whether construction or production of any property includes ""material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity"" would be determined based on whether the ""material assistance cost ratio"" is less than the ""threshold percentage"".

Threshold percentages:

For any qualified facility under sections 45Y or 48E, the threshold percentage would be:

40% if construction begins in 2026;

45% if construction begins in 2027;

50% if construction begins in 2028;

55% if construction begins in 2029; and

60% if construction begins after Dec. 31, 2029.

For energy storage technology under section 48E, the threshold percentage would be:

55% if construction begins in 2026;

60% if construction begins in 2027;

65% if construction begins in 2028;

70% if construction begins in 2029; and

75% if construction begins in after Dec. 31, 2029.

For solar energy components:

50% if sold during 2026;

60% if sold during 2027;

70% if sold during 2028;

80% if sold during 2029; and

85% if sold after Dec. 31, 2029.

For wind energy components:

85% if sold during 2026; and

90% if sold during 2027.

For inverters:

50% if sold during 2026;

55% if sold during 2027;

60% if sold during 2028;

65% if sold during 2029; and

70% if sold after Dec. 31, 2029.

For qualifying battery components:

60% if sold during 2026;

65% if sold during 2027;

70% if sold during 2028;

80% if sold during 2029; and

85% if sold after Dec. 31, 2029.

For applicable critical minerals:

0% if sold after Dec. 31, 2025 and before Jan. 1, 2030;

25% if sold during 2030;

30% if sold during 2031;

40% if sold during 2032; and

50% if sold after Dec. 31, 2032.

Observation: For purposes of the FEOC requirements, the bill would codify that ""beginning of construction"" for tax purposes is determined pursuant to rules under IRS Notices 2013-29 and 2018-59 (as well as any subsequently issued guidance clarifying, modifying, or updating either Notice), as in effect on Jan. 1, 2025.

Observation: Treasury would be required to issue guidance not later than Dec. 31, 2027 applying new threshold percentages for critical minerals equaling or exceeding these amounts, taking into account domestic geographic availability, supply chain constraints, domestic processing capacity needs, and national security concerns.

Material assistance cost ratios:

For any qualified facility or energy storage technology, the material assistance cost ratio is the ratio of (i) the total costs of all manufactured products incorporated into the qualified facility or energy storage technology upon completion of construction minus such costs that are mined, produced, or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity, divided by (ii) the total costs of all manufactured products incorporated into the qualified facility or energy storage technology upon completion of construction.

""Manufactured product"" has the same meaning as provided in domestic content guidance.

For any product line that produces eligible components, the material assistance cost ratio is the ratio of (i) the total direct materials costs that are paid or incurred for production of such eligible components minus such costs that are mined, produced, or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity, divided by (ii) the total direct materials costs that are paid or incurred for production of such eligible components.

Safe harbor tables: Not later than Dec. 31, 2026, Treasury would be required to issue safe harbor tables. Until then, and for qualified facilities that begin construction within 60 days after the issuance of such tables, a taxpayer may (i) use the tables provided in the domestic content safe harbor guidance (IRS Notice 2025-08) to establish the total direct material cost of any listed eligible component or manufactured product and (ii) rely on a certification by the supplier that the manufactured product, eligible component, constituent element, material, or subcomponent was not produced or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity.

Certification requirement: The certification from the supplier would be required to (i) include the supplier's EIN, (ii) be signed under penalty of perjury, (iii) be retained by the supplier for not less than 6 years and be provided to the IRS upon request, and (iv) state either (1) that such property was not produced or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity and that the supplier does not know (or have reason to know) that any prior supplier in the chain of production of that property is a prohibited foreign entity, or (2) the total direct material cost for each product or component that were not produced or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity.

If a taxpayer knows or has reason to know that a manufactured product or eligible component was produced or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity, then the taxpayer must treat all direct material costs with respect to such product or component as mined, produced, or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity and may not rely on a certification from the supplier.

Binding written contract exception: Upon the election of the taxpayer (in form and manner to be designated by Treasury), any manufactured product, eligible component, or constituent element, material, or subcomponent acquired by the taxpayer pursuant to a binding written contract entered into before June 16, 2025, and placed in service before Jan. 1, 2030 (January 1, 2028 in the case of solar and wind property used to generate electricity) in a facility that began construction before August 1, 2025, would not be included for purposes of determining the material assistance cost ratio.

Observation: The imposition of FEOC rules to tax credit qualification would introduce an additional layer of complexity. The statute would further authorize the Treasury Department to issue regulations under these rules, including establishing rules to prevent evasion, circumvention, or abuse of the rules through (i) impermissible technology licensing arrangements with specified foreign entities, (ii) abuse of the binding written contract exception through stockpiling of any manufactured product, eligible component, or constituent material, or subcomponent during any period prior to application of the rules, or where the facts and circumstances demonstrate that the beginning of construction of a qualified facility or energy storage technology has not in fact occurred.

Extended assessment period: Any deficiency attributable to an error in the determination of material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity could be assessed within 6 years after the return for such year was filed.

Accuracy-related penalty: If there is a ""disallowance of an applicable energy credit"", then the substantial understatement of income tax penalty would apply to understatements of income tax by more than 1% of the tax required to be shown on the return.

A ""disallowance of an applicable energy credit"" would be disallowance of a credit under sections 45X, 45Y, or 48E by reason of overstating the material assistance cost ratio.

For an entity claiming direct pay under section 6417, a ""disallowance of an applicable energy credit"" would cause an ""excessive payment"" and incur the 20% penalty on the amount of the excessive payment (unless the taxpayer shows reasonable cause).

Penalty for false certification of supplier: If an inaccurate or false certification by a supplier results in the ""disallowance of an applicable energy credit"" and the understatement of income tax exceeds the lesser of (i) 5% of the tax required to be shown on the return or (ii) $100,000, then the person making the certification would be required to pay a penalty equal to the greater of (a) 10% of the amount of the underpayment attributable to the inaccuracy or falsity or (b) $5,000 (unless the person shows reasonable cause).

Families are getting hit from both sides: state-level rate increases and federal cuts to clean energy support.
And that means clean energy — built right here, by American workers, for the people who need it most.","The following is the opinion and analysis of the writer:

This Independence Day, we’ll hear a lot about patriotism and American strength abroad. But to me, as a former Marine, real independence also means protecting our people here at home — not leaving working families vulnerable to rising energy costs, foreign oil markets and preventable crises. Right now, veterans and families across Arizona are facing skyrocketing utility bills. And if conflict in the Middle East escalates, gas prices could spike again. The last thing we need is another hit to household budgets.

Instead of protecting Americans from these threats, Republicans in Congress are making them worse. Donald Trump and his allies in D.C. have passed a federal budget ending clean energy tax credits that help families and businesses save money on solar, heat pumps, EVs, and more — ultimately driving up energy costs. That means higher bills at home and more pain at the pump, at a time when Arizona households are already stretched thin.

As a veteran who deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, I’ve seen how energy dependence shapes our foreign policy, our national security, and the risks to our troops. And as a mother raising my son in rural Arizona, I know what it’s like to watch costs rise while politicians posture instead of deliver.

Let’s be clear: What Trump and Republicans have done isn’t about energy independence. It’s about deepening our dependence — on hostile foreign governments, volatile oil markets, and a system that keeps families and local businesses exposed to price gouging and grid failures. Republicans talk about freedom, but their policies tie us to fossil fuel instability while handing out tax breaks to billionaires.

Clean energy is the way out. It’s reliable. It’s affordable. And it’s American-made.

Thanks to clean energy investments, Arizona has brought in more than $13 billion and created 13,000-plus new jobs since 2022. Every solar panel installed, every battery storage site built, and every EV on the road makes us more secure. It means more savings, stable bills, more local jobs, and a stronger economy.

Clean energy like solar, wind, battery storage, and EVs also plays a role in operational safety. Arizona hosts several major military facilities. Reducing fossil fuel reliance helps those bases function securely and efficiently, while increasing self-sufficiency and reducing the need for risky fuel transport.

Instead of building on this momentum, Republicans in Congress are reversing it. They’re doing the oil industry’s bidding while claiming to support American strength. But the reality is that their plan will raise household electricity bills by up to $400 a year and gas prices by at least 25 cents per gallon. Here in Arizona, utilities like Arizona Public Service (APS) and Tucson Electric Power (TEP) are already proposing 14% rate hikes — driven partly by outdated energy policy and rising fossil fuel costs. Families are getting hit from both sides: state-level rate increases and federal cuts to clean energy support.

Trump recently said himself that raising gas prices was aiding the enemy. Maybe he should read the bill his own party has passed.

Meanwhile, the climate crisis is accelerating. In Arizona, we’re seeing more intense heat waves, longer droughts, and more destructive wildfires. These aren’t abstract concerns — they’re national security threats. Extreme weather strains our grid, increases blackout risk, and exposes vulnerabilities adversaries could exploit. Our infrastructure and emergency systems are being pushed to the brink.

Clean energy isn’t a luxury. It’s a necessity. It protects our economy, our military readiness, and our health. It reduces our exposure to global conflict and keeps the power on when families need it most.

This Independence Day, let’s move past slogans and act like energy freedom actually matters. Because freedom means being able to pay your bills. It means jobs that stay in your community. It means resilience when disaster strikes — and clean air to breathe while you rebuild.

If we want real independence, we have to build it. And that means clean energy — built right here, by American workers, for the people who need it most.

The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says Senate Republicans were employing an “accounting gimmick that would make Enron executives blush.” ___","WASHINGTON (AP) — Republicans muscled President Donald Trump’s tax and spending cut bill through the House on Thursday, the final step necessary to get the bill to his desk by the GOP’s self-imposed deadline of July 4th.

At nearly 900 pages, the legislation is a sprawling collection of tax breaks, spending cuts and other Republican priorities, including new money for national defense and deportations.

Democrats united against the legislation, but were powerless to stop it as long as Republicans stayed united. The Senate passed the bill, with Vice President JD Vance casting the tiebreaking vote. The House passed an earlier iteration of the bill in May with just one vote to spare. It passed the final version 218-214.

Here’s the latest on what’s in the bill and when some of its provisions go into effect.

GOP bill includes reductions for businesses and new tax breaks

Republicans say the bill is crucial because there would be a massive tax increase after December when tax breaks from Trump’s first term expire. The legislation contains about $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.

The existing tax rates and brackets would become permanent under the bill, solidifying the tax cuts approved in Trump’s first term.

It temporarily would add new tax deductions on tip, overtime and auto loans. There’s also a $6,000 deduction for older adults who earn no more than $75,000 a year, a nod to his pledge to end taxes on Social Security benefits.

It would boost the $2,000 child tax credit to $2,200. Millions of families at lower income levels would not get the full credit.

A cap on state and local deductions, called SALT, would quadruple to $40,000 for five years. It’s a provision important to New York and other high tax states, though the House wanted it to last for 10 years.

There are scores of business-related tax cuts, including allowing businesses to immediately write off 100% of the cost of equipment and research. Proponents say this will boost economic growth.

The wealthiest households would see a $12,000 increase from the legislation, and the bill would cost the poorest people $1,600 a year, mainly due to reductions in Medicaid and food aid, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office analysis of the House’s version.

GOP bill funds the border wall, deportations and a missile shield

The bill would provide some $350 billion for Trump’s border and national security agenda, including for the U.S.-Mexico border wall and for 100,000 migrant detention facility beds, as he aims to fulfill his promise of the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history.

Money would go for hiring 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, with $10,000 signing bonuses and a surge of Border Patrol officers, as well. The goal is to deport some 1 million people per year.

To help pay for it, immigrants would face various new fees, including when seeking asylum protections.

For the Pentagon, the bill would provide billions for ship building, munitions systems, and quality of life measures for servicemen and women, as well as $25 billion for the development of the Golden Dome missile defense system. The Defense Department would have $1 billion for border security.

Medicaid, SNAP face deep cuts to fund bill’s tax breaks and spending

To help partly offset the lost tax revenue and new spending, Republicans aim to cut back on Medicaid and food assistance for people below the poverty line.

Republicans argue they are trying to rightsize the safety net programs for the population they were initially designed to serve, mainly pregnant women, the disabled and children, and root out what they describe as waste, fraud and abuse.

The package includes new 80-hour-a-month work requirements for many adults receiving Medicaid and food stamps, including older people up to age 65. Parents of children 14 and older would have to meet the program’s work requirements.

There’s also a proposed new $35 co-payment that can be charged to patients using Medicaid services.

More than 71 million people rely on Medicaid, which expanded under Obama’s Affordable Care Act, and 40 million use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Most already work, according to analysts.

The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 11.8 million more Americans would become uninsured by 2034 if the bill became law and 3 million more would not qualify for food stamps, also known as SNAP benefits.

Republicans are looking to have states pick up some of the cost for SNAP benefits. Currently, the federal government funds all benefit costs. Under the bill, states beginning in 2028 will be required to contribute a set percentage of those costs if their payment error rate exceeds 6%. Payment errors include both underpayments and overpayments.

But the Senate bill temporarily delays the start date of that cost-sharing for states with the highest SNAP error rates. Alaska has the highest error rate in the nation at nearly 25%, according to Department of Agriculture data. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, had fought for the exception. She was a decisive vote in getting the bill through the Senate.

The ‘big beautiful’ bill slashes clean energy tax credits

Republicans are proposing to dramatically roll back tax breaks designed to boost clean energy projects fueled by renewable sources such as energy and wind. The tax breaks were a central component of President Joe Biden’s 2022 landmark bill focused on addressing climate change and lowering health care costs.

Democratic Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden went so far as to call the GOP provisions a “death sentence for America’s wind and solar industries and an inevitable hike in utility bills.”

A tax break for people who buy new or used electric vehicles would expire on Sept. 30 of this year, instead of at the end of 2032 under current law.

Meanwhile, a tax credit for the production of critical materials will be expanded to include metallurgical coal used in steelmaking.

The bill creates ‘Trump Accounts’ — and funds a national hero garden

A number of extra provisions reflect other GOP priorities.

The bill creates a new children’s savings program, called Trump Accounts, with a potential $1,000 deposit from the Treasury.

The Senate provided $40 million to establish Trump’s long-sought “National Garden of American Heroes.”

There’s a new excise tax on university endowments and a new tax on remittances, or transfers of money that people in the U.S. send abroad. The tax is equal to 1% of the transfer.

A $200 tax on gun silencers and short-barreled rifles and shotguns was eliminated.

One provision bars for one year Medicaid payments to family planning providers that provide abortions, namely Planned Parenthood.

Another section expands the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, a hard-fought provision from GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, for those impacted by nuclear development and testing.

Billions would go for the Artemis moon mission and for the exploration of Mars, while $88 million is earmarked for a pandemic response accountability committee.

Additionally, a provision would increase the nation’s debt limit, by $5 trillion, to allow continued borrowing to pay already accrued bills.

State AI regulations cut from bill after a GOP uproar

The Senate overwhelmingly revolted against a proposal meant to deter states from regulating artificial intelligence. Republican governors across the country asked for the moratorium to be removed and the Senate voted to do so with a resounding 99-1 vote.

A provision was thrown in at the final hours that will provide $10 billion annually to rural hospitals for five years, or $50 billion in total. The Senate bill had originally provided $25 billion for the program, but that number was upped to win over holdout GOP senators and a coalition of House Republicans warning that reduced Medicaid provider taxes would hurt rural hospitals.

The amended bill also stripped out a new tax on wind and solar projects that use a certain percentage of components from China.

Final price tag: GOP bill could add $3.3 trillion to deficit

Altogether, the Congressional Budget Office projects that the bill would increase federal deficits over the next 10 years by nearly $3.3 trillion from 2025 to 2034.

Or not, depending on how one does the math.

Senate Republicans are proposing a unique strategy of not counting the existing tax breaks as a new cost because those breaks are already “current policy.” Republican senators say the Senate Budget Committee chairman has the authority to set the baseline for the preferred approach.

Under the alternative Senate GOP view, the bill would reduce deficits by almost half a trillion dollars over the coming decade, the CBO said.

Democrats say this is “magic math” that obscures the true costs of the tax breaks. Some nonpartisan groups worried about the country’s fiscal trajectory are siding with Democrats in that regard. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says Senate Republicans were employing an “accounting gimmick that would make Enron executives blush.”

China’s industrial policy has engineered a remarkable transformation to electric vehicles in what is the world’s largest auto market. In so doing, it has spawned far more makers than can possibly survive. Now, long-simmering concerns about oversupply and debilitating price wars are coming to the fore, even as the headline sales numbers soar to new heights.

Market-leader BYD announced this week that its sales grew 31% in the first six months of the year to 2.1 million cars. Nearly half of those were pure electric vehicles and the rest were plug-in hybrids, it said in a Hong Kong Stock Exchange filing. The company phased out internal combustion engine cars in 2022.

BYD came under thinly veiled criticism in late May when it launched a new round of price cuts, and several competitors followed suit. The chairman of Great Wall Motors warned the industry could come under threat if it continues on the same trajectory.

“When volumes get bigger, it’s just much harder to manage and you become the bullseye,” said Lei Xing, an independent analyst who follows the industry.

The government is trying to rein in what is called “involution” — a term initially applied to the rat race for young people in China and now to companies and industries engaged in meaningless competition that leads nowhere.

BYD has come under criticism for using its dominant position in ways that some consider unfair, sparking price wars that have caused losses across the industry, said Murthy Grandhi, an India-based financial risk analyst at GlobalData.

With the price war in its fourth year, Chinese automakers are looking abroad for profits. BYD’s overseas sales more than doubled to 464,000 units in the first half of this year. Worried governments in the U.S. and EU have imposed tariffs on made-in-China electric vehicles, saying that subsidies have given them an unfair advantage.

Market leader BYD comes under attack

The latest bout of handwringing started when BYD cut the price of more than 20 models on May 23.

The same day, the chairman of Great Wall Motors, Wei Jianjun, said he was pessimistic about what he called the “healthy development” of the EV market. He drew a comparison to Evergrande, the Chinese real estate giant whose collapse sent the entire industry into a downturn from which it has yet to recover.

“The Evergrande in the automobile industry already exists, but it is just yet to explode,” he said in a video message posted on social media.

Two days later, a BYD executive rejected any comparison to Evergrande and posted data-filled charts to buttress his case.

“To be honest, I am confused and angry and it’s ridiculous!” Li Yunfei, BYD’s general manager of brand and public relations, wrote on social media. “All these come from the shocking remarks made by Chairman Wei of Great Wall Motors.”

Next, the government and an industry association weighed in. The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers called for fair competition and healthy development of the industry, noting that major price cuts by one automaker had triggered a new price war panic.

On the same day, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology vowed to tackle involution-style competition in the auto industry, saying that recent disorderly price wars posed a treat to the healthy and sustainable development of the sector.

“That price cut might have been the final straw that irked both competitors and regulators for the ruthlessness that BYD continues to show,” Lei said.

A promise to pay suppliers within 60 days signals possible shift

The following month, 17 automakers including BYD made a pledge: They would pay their suppliers within 60 days.

One way China’s automakers have been surviving the bruising price wars is by delaying the payments for months. The agreement, if adhered to, would reduce financial pressure on suppliers and could rein in some of the fierce competition.

“The introduction of the 60-day payment pledge is the call of the government to oppose involution-style competition,” said Cui Dongshu, the secretary-general of the China Passenger Car Association.

It also reduces the risk of an Evergrande-like scenario.

Many automakers had stretched out payments by paying suppliers with short-term debt — promises to repay them in a certain period of time — instead of cash. Real estate developers used the same system. It worked until it didn’t. When Evergrande defaulted on its debts, suppliers were left holding worthless promises to pay.

“This practice is seen as a potential cause of a larger crisis, similar to what happened with Evergrande,” Grandhi said.

The vows to speed up payments and the government calls to rein in the price wars, along with a rollback of some financing offers, point to an effort to reverse downward price expectations, said Jing Yang, a director at Fitch Ratings who focuses on the auto industry.

“We may watch how effectively these measures are in reversing the price trend and how would that affect EV demand in the coming quarters,” she said.

The analysis included all capacity reductions that were active during July 1-2.","Heatwaves have a major impact on European power systems

From economic to energy security challenges, heatwaves bring major disruptions to electricity grids.

1.1 Heatwaves can increase daily power demand by up to 14% and double average prices

During the 2025 heatwave, culminating between June 28 and July 2, peak daily temperatures averaged over the whole country reached 35°C in Germany and Spain (with local maximums exceeding 40°C), 34°C in France and 30°C in Poland. In the most striking case of Germany, this meant a 9°C increase in peak daily temperature compared to just a week before.

This temperature increase had a major impact on electricity demand – which grew by up to 6% in Germany, 9% in France and 14% in Spain, when comparing a Tuesday before (June 24) and during the heatwave (July 1). Peak demand grew as well, by 12% in France and 15% in Spain, and 5% in Germany and Poland.

The demand trends, combined with outages of thermal power plants (described in the following section), led to a dramatic rise of electricity prices. Compared to the same baseline day of June 24, during the heatwave average daily prices grew by 15% in Spain, 106% in Poland, 108% in France and 175% in Germany – in the latter case almost tripling. During peak evening hours on July 1, prices reached over 400 €/MWh in Germany and over 470 €/MWh in Poland.

1.2 Heatwaves elevate the risk of thermal plant outages

Heatwaves impact electricity systems in several ways. The overheating of cables is the likely cause of power outages in Italy on July 1. With rising air and water temperatures, the cooling of thermal power plants becomes more challenging as well. This led to forced reductions in electricity generation from nuclear power plants in France and Switzerland. In Poland, longtime concerns around the cooling of coal power plants led to several remedial actions in the past few years. To further strengthen grid resilience, at the peak of the heatwave on July 2, the government together with the grid operator PSE proposed an anti-blackout package.

The French nuclear fleet has been impacted the most, with all but one of the 18 facilities experiencing some type of capacity reduction. Power plants along the Garonne, Loire and Rhône rivers were impacted the most, with e.g. the Golfech plant having to shut down completely. While multiple reductions were related to scheduled maintenance, at least 7 GW of offline capacity on July 1–2 was marked as “Forced” by the transmission system operator (TSO). Reductions in Bugey 2 and Golfech 1 were marked as “Planned”, but specifically spanned the heatwave period. This means that the heatwave might have impacted up to 15% of France’s nuclear capacity.

In the peak days of the heatwave, solar delivered up to 50 GW of power in Germany alone, generating 33–39% of Germany’s electricity. Germany has 14 GW of battery storage and 10 GW of pumped storage, which helped to store some solar to use when the sun went down.

Solar power is one of the cheapest forms of electricity that Europe has. However, when the sun goes down, electricity will naturally be more expensive. Consumers using air conditioning to keep cool during a hot day should have access to cheap electricity. But when the sun goes down, they will need to pay more to use power-hungry AC units. Smart electrification and time of use tariffs can not only unlock consumer savings, but also ease grid balancing at times of stress, such as during a heatwave.

This means that matching electricity consumption with generation mattered more than ever. Storage assets benefitted from price spreads, charging at low prices and discharging during expensive peak time, reducing the need for costly imported fossil fuels in the evening, and supporting the balancing of the grid.

Interconnection played a role as well. The heatwave swept across Europe, peaking in Madrid on Sunday, Paris on Tuesday, Berlin and Warsaw on Wednesday – and with that, interconnectors moved electricity to where it was needed most, dissipating the price peaks in the process. In fact after the major blackout earlier in 2025, Spain and Portugal have been calling for more interconnection, to help in stabilizing the grid after potential disruptions – such as ones related to heatwaves.

2.3 Additional solutions can boost grid resilience during extreme weather events

Aside from the deployment of clean flexibility, storage and interconnection, several actions are being taken by European grid operators to plan for times of grid stress, or even blackouts. Some of them are still pilot or R&D projects, but heatwaves like the recent one make a strong case for their wide adoption.

The Distributed ReStart project by the UK National Energy System Operator (NESO) explored how distributed energy sources, including wind and solar, could be used to restart the grid after a blackout. One of the recommendations was to increase the adoption of grid-forming inverters that can start without external voltage supply, building renewables-powered energy islands that are later joined to synchronize the whole grid. Modelling of grid forming assets is tested by the Belgian TSO – Elia, as well.

Several grid-forming solutions are already available. However, it is key to ensure they can access ancillary services markets to reach broad adoption – as proven in NESO’s Quick Reserve auction. System services markets, like inertia or voltage control markets, are being rolled out in multiple countries, including the UK, Germany, the Netherlands.

Coinciding with the heatwaves, the Polish Transmission System Operator – PSE, has proposed an anti-blackout recommendations package on July 2. The package proposes several measures, such as: access to real-time data from distributed energy sources and storage units, and an ability to control their operations in emergency situations; wider adoption of dynamic tariffs; or increased participation of generation units in the balancing market. All of these measures should provide the TSO with more control over the grid, and eliminate the risk of blackouts ahead of time.

Weather

Weather data is sourced from the Open-Meteo API; Country temperatures are calculated by extracting data for grid points within a country on a 0.25 degree resolution and averaging across all grid points for every hour. The peak temperature is the value in the hour with the highest average temperature.

Demand

Demand is calculated based on hourly data from ENTSO-E, Agora, Energy-Charts and REE. In Spain, reported solar generation is scaled to account for unreported behind-the-meter solar installations.

French nuclear outages

Data on nuclear plant reductions was sourced from the ENTSO-E Transparency platform. Typically, outages or capacity reductions are grouped into “Forced” and “Planned” – the latter being e.g. scheduled maintenance, the former being unexpected faults, or environmental issues like heatwaves. However, this grouping isn’t always consistent. Reductions such as Bugey 2 and Golfech 1 were marked as “Planned”, but were directly linked to the temperature conditions, as reported by EDF. In some cases, plants ramped up or down during the heatwave period – in such cases the average reduction capacity was used in the analysis. The analysis included all capacity reductions that were active during July 1-2. From the 23 GW of reductions, 7 GW were marked as “Forced”, with at least 2-3 GW additional capacity marked as “Planned” in ENTSO-E data, but spanning specifically the period of mid-June to mid-July.",https://ember-energy.org/app/uploads/2023/11/1-34-Rooftop-Solar-Netherlands.jpg,N,,2025-07-04 14:12:57.649298

This includes: Unlocking up to 10 GW of onshore wind by resolving issues with how onshore wind turbines and aerospace civil and defence infrastructure co-exist.
Clean energy is the economic opportunity of the 21st Century, and thanks to the government’s clean energy mission, investment is booming in the UK, with over £40 billion of private investment in clean energy announced since July.
The measures come as the government has completed a process to de-risk offshore wind developments, led by the Marine Spatial Prioritisation Programme, thus unleashing the potential for offshore wind development in the English sea in the future.?
This should also reduce the planning consent risk for developers on future offshore wind sites before seabed rights are tendered – speeding up and de-risking future offshore wind projects.","The amount of clean, homegrown energy from onshore wind is set to accelerate over the second half of the decade as the government launches the first ever onshore wind strategy.

Thousands of new jobs for British people in onshore wind, such as engineering, construction, and operations maintenance, could be created by 2030 to build the onshore wind needed to deliver clean power for families and businesses.

After facing a de-facto nine-year ban in England, the strategy sets out over 40 radical actions to get onshore wind building again across the UK. This includes:

Unlocking up to 10 GW of onshore wind by resolving issues with how onshore wind turbines and aerospace civil and defence infrastructure co-exist.

Repowering of old turbines across the country, so the UK can maintain its cur-rent fleet and keep powering the country with clean, secure, homegrown power.

Equipping planners and developers with the tools needed for the first English projects since the de facto ban was lifted last year. This includes making sure planning decisions are based on up-to-date information and ensuring site surveying and assessments for projects are more efficient to speed up decision-making.

Exploring plans to expand the clean industry bonus for onshore wind, encouraging developers to invest in supply chains in the UK’s industrial heartlands, or in cleaner supply chains.

The strategy adds to the actions the government has taken since taking office, such as lifting the ban in England and reintroducing onshore wind into the Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects regime. These measures mean that onshore wind will be put on an equal footing to offshore wind and nuclear, meaning projects can get built quicker in the years to come.

Delivering this strategy could more than double the current onshore wind workforce, supporting up to 45 000 skilled jobs across the country by 2030, as the government pursues its clean power ambition of 27 – 29 GW of onshore wind by 2030.

Clean energy is the economic opportunity of the 21st Century, and thanks to the government’s clean energy mission, investment is booming in the UK, with over £40 billion of private investment in clean energy announced since July.

Onshore wind is one of the easiest and cheapest technologies to build and will supply British homes and businesses with clean, secure homegrown power that ends a reliance on unstable global gas markets – all part of the mission to get bills down for good.

Energy Minister, Michael Shanks, said:?”Rolling out more onshore wind is a no-brainer – it’s one of our cheapest technologies, quick to build, supports thousands of skilled jobs and can provide clean energy directly to the communities hosting it.?

“After years of decline, we’re giving industry the tools to get building again, backing industrial renewal and secure, clean, homegrown energy through our Plan for Change.”

Matthieu Hue, Co-Chair of the Onshore Wind Taskforce and CEO of EDF Power Solutions UK and Ireland, added: “This strategy is focusing on overcoming barriers and challenges we face across the industry in the deployment of onshore wind while capturing the major socio-economic benefits it can bring to the environment and to local economies.

“Together we are forging a path forward for onshore wind in Great Britain, and we are committed to ensuring a successful implementation through a new Onshore Wind Council, which will oversee the execution of the strategy. This is a critical part of making Britain a clean energy superpower and delivering energy security.”

Communities are set to benefit too with the voluntary community benefits guidance for onshore wind for England being updated to provide communities with £5000/MW/y for community initiatives, such as new football pitches or libraries, or even bill discount schemes.?

By delivering the upper Clean Power 2030 ambition of 29 GW of onshore wind, it is estimated that an additional £70 million of community funding will be unlocked for rural towns and villages every year.?

The measures come as the government has completed a process to de-risk offshore wind developments, led by the Marine Spatial Prioritisation Programme, thus unleashing the potential for offshore wind development in the English sea in the future.?

This will help guide The Crown Estate’s Marine Delivery Routemap on strategic use of the seabed to unlock offshore wind in a way that considers all marine sectors including fisheries and protects the marine environment.??

This should also reduce the planning consent risk for developers on future offshore wind sites before seabed rights are tendered – speeding up and de-risking future offshore wind projects.

Sue Ferns, Senior Deputy General Secretary of Prospect, commented: “Onshore wind has an important role to play in a secure and decarbonised energy mix so it is welcome that the government is taking steps to support its rollout.

“However, the lost years resulting from the last government’s inexplicable ban have resulted in significant workforce and skills related challenges that urgently need to be addressed, which hopefully they will be in the forthcoming Clean Energy Workforce Plan.

“It is also important that renewables such as onshore wind generate good, unionised jobs – if the government wants the clean energy transition to be fair and to deliver the full economic potential, it must insist on this as a condition for the support it provides.”

James Robottom, Head of Onshore Wind Delivery, RenewableUK, concluded: “Overturning the unpopular onshore wind ban, which deprived us of one of the quickest and cheapest technologies to build for a decade, was just the start. The hard work to make the most of this great opportunity to grow our economy and strengthen the UK’s energy security is now in full swing.

“This strategy sets an ambitious target to almost double the UK’s onshore wind capacity by the end of the decade as a key part of the government’s Clean Power by 2030 mission.

“The measures outlined will increase confidence among investors and developers, so that we can attract billions in private investment and create thousands of highly-skilled jobs and new supply chains all over the country. The strategy also sets out how people living near onshore wind farms will continue to see tailor-made community benefits through an updated Community Benefit Protocol for England, deciding for themselves the form that these benefits should take, to support and improve the lives of those in areas hosting onshore wind.”

1), with self-identified Democrats generally showing greater agreement with strong action narratives and less agreement with inactive/dismissing narratives compared to Republicans.
Policymakers underestimate public support for N.12 (Systems Change) to an even greater extent than the public and overestimate public support for N.14 (Free Market Solutions).
Despite these limitations, the present work presents evidence that certain climate narratives may motivate climate action.
For each pro-environmental action, participants responded on a scale from “not at all motivated”1 to “very motivated”5.","How should we address climate change? There are many pathways and solutions in circulation about how we could or should address climate change. A few examples of climate solution narratives generated and circulated by scientists, pundits, activists, and policymakers range from powering society using 100% wind, water, and solar energy1 to relying on nuclear energy for decarbonization2; some say we must focus on climate policies only and that focusing on personal behavior is a distraction3,4 while others hold that we need both policies and lifestyle changes5,6. Some advocate for the vital role of philanthropy7, and others focus on the critical need to fundamentally change our economic systems8. Yet other climate narratives hold that governmental solutions proposed cause more harm than good; we should instead rely on the free market9. Understanding who endorses which narratives and why may be key to successful climate action. People often make sense of complex actions, like mitigating climate change, in simplified narratives that allow them to understand causality across many events, form their attitudes, and decide on a course of action10,11,12,13. Given the central role of narratives in sense-making and decision-making, what narratives do the American public and policymakers endorse? And how do these narratives relate to motivation to take action?

Here, we focus on narratives that center on climate change solution efforts through different methods. Previous work has examined narratives that frame climate solutions either as individual or systemic action, to test whether framing climate solutions in one way inhibits the other type of action3 or leads to positive spillover effects14. However, this work did not examine the popularity of these two and a broad range of other climate solutions among the American public. Other studies have examined discourse about climate-action delay15, identifying four narratives that dissuade immediate and transformational climate action: redirecting responsibility (“someone else should act first”), pushing for non-transformative solutions (“disruptive change is not necessary”), emphasizing the downsides of climate policies (“change will be disruptive”), or surrendering to climate change (“it is not possible to mitigate climate change”). Here, we focus on a broader range of narratives that primarily center on climate solutions, including some related narratives of climate action delay. We document their popularity among respondents in the U.S. and the relationship between narrative endorsements and behavioral intentions and policy support for climate action.

Recent evidence finds that Americans hold inaccurate perceptions about climate concern and the popularity of climate policies among fellow Americans16,17. We extend this research on pluralistic ignorance by answering the following two questions: (1) Do people misperceive the endorsement of narratives about various climate change solutions of other Americans? (2) Do policymakers, who are tasked with representing the will of the people, misperceive which climate solution narratives are popular? Two studies measure the extent of these two types of pluralistic ignorance of narrative endorsement.

Additionally, we examine which narratives motivate action. In understanding the link between narratives and motivation, researchers have posited that narratives that center on agentic actions modeled by others can motivate personal action18. Indeed, stories about others holding pro-environmental intentions and enacting pro-environmental behavior can increase one’s motivation for personal and collective action as well as policy support19. Research also finds that narratives about conservation issues (e.g., unsustainable industrial fishing practices) can influence individual action and policy support depending on how individual versus industrial responsibility is highlighted and therefore which solutions seem appropriate20. From this work, it appears that narratives that frame climate change solutions as having a role for individual action (personally, collectively, or politically) and where participating in that solution is fitting given the nature of the problem, should correspond to greater motivation to adopt sustainable behavior, participate in political action, and support climate change policies. Additionally, narratives that privilege one of these pursuits (either only lifestyle action, political action, or policy changes) over others may see motivations raised for the action described by that narrative. Do we see this reflected in our data that maps respondents’ endorsement of different narratives to their self-reported willingness to take either personal, collective, or political action? And which narratives specifically correspond with the greatest motivation to act across an array of important climate mitigation fronts? The variety of climate solutions narratives may itself be a problem, as presenting alternative solutions can lead people to be unsure about the right course of action21,22. Thus, narratives that propose multiple paths to solutions may be associated with lower motivation for all behaviors.

Climate change solution narratives found in America

The narratives we investigated were obtained through an iterative process that combined more and less formalized approaches. We created a provisional list of narratives about climate change solutions circulating in the U.S. using an informal search in popular media, news articles, social media, and by examining discussions about climate solutions by climate advocates, climate scientists, political figures, pundits, and other public figures contributing to popular discourse. We limited our scope to narratives that focused on ways to address or solve climate change, including narratives of delaying action until later. This means that we did not focus heavily on the variety of climate denial narratives, but instead focused on different strategies to mitigate climate change. Narratives that contrasted mitigation broadly with adaptation or inaction were included. Using this approach, we arrived at a provisional list of 24 narratives about climate change.

To refine this list, we then conducted a pilot study to examine correlations between agreement with these narratives, so that we could combine narratives that were similar in content and correlated highly in endorsement (see Supplementary Notes 1, Supplementary Table 1, and Supplementary Fig. 1). We then reached out to climate policy experts and advocates whose work pertains to public narratives about climate change to informally elicit additional narratives they believed were missing. We then trimmed the list down to remove narratives that did not involve solutions to climate change.

After these steps, we arrived at 20 narratives about climate change solutions in the U.S., found in Table 1. Each narrative was made similar in simplicity and length by stating how each solution may or may not address climate change in a brief (less than 250 characters) statement. See example quotes from academic papers and popular press that represent each narrative in Supplementary Table 2.

To measure narrative endorsement and potential pluralistic ignorance about the level of support for these narratives, we collected two representative samples of the U.S. public (Study 1) and local-level policymakers (Study 2). In each study, participants reported their own endorsement of each narrative, as well as how widely endorsed they think it is among the U.S. public. To examine the effect of narrative salience on climate action behavior, we examined the relationships between narrative endorsement and willingness to take various climate actions among the U.S. public (Study 1). To add causal evidence to these relationships, we also conducted Study 3 that exposed a representative sample of Americans to one of six climate action narratives that were described as enjoying a growing consensus and measured the effect of exposure to each of these narratives on participants’ willingness to engage in the same set climate actions described for Study 1 above. We expected that seeing evidence of the popularity of that narrative in major public media should induce conformity to the content of that narrative. For example, seeing a narrative about the need for both policy and behavior should increase both lifestyle and political action intentions, while narratives about the need for only policy change should only increase support for political action and policy support. While we did not have strict hypotheses about which narratives would be most popular or the degree to which their popularity would be underestimated, we expected some variation in both of these. As such, these studies were meant as exploratory and descriptive studies of narrative popularity and misperceptions.

Americans support multi-action and strong action climate solutions

Respondents showed the greatest endorsement of the narrative that we need both policy and lifestyle changes, showing that the American public may generally recognize a need for multiple types of action and not simply one or the other (see Fig. 1 that lists narratives in their order of endorsement). While less popular, there was still general agreement with narratives that emphasized individual action (e.g., N.3 Just Educate People, N.4 Behavior Only, N.8 Ripple Effect) or incremental system changes (e.g., N.5 Technosalvation, N.2 Build Back Better).

Conversely, narratives that centered around personal inaction, either by shifting blame and responsibility to other entities (e.g., N.15 Climate Deniers’ Fault, N.20 Future Generations Problem, N.14 Free Market Solutions, N.17 In God’s Hands) or by denying the problem and potential solutions (e.g., N.19 Not Serious, N.18 Too Late—Adapt) were generally not endorsed. Narratives that emphasized policy change only or a dramatic change of the economic system (N.13 Policy Only, N.12 Systems Change) were rated on average between agreement and disagreement, with greater agreement given to narratives that also involved individual level change.

There were partisan differences in agreement with these narratives (see Fig. 1), with self-identified Democrats generally showing greater agreement with strong action narratives and less agreement with inactive/dismissing narratives compared to Republicans. However, the most popular narratives overall are still the top narratives for both Republicans and Democrats. A few narratives were endorsed at similar rates by both partisan groups (i.e., N.4 Behavior Only, N.6 No Reasonable Solution, N.18 Too Late—Adapt, N.15 Climate Deniers’ Fault, N.20 Future Generations’ Problem). A smaller number still showed general disagreement (i.e., N.19 Not Serious, N.17 In God’s Hands, N.14 Free Market Solutions, N.12 Systems Change, N.9 Anti-Incremental Change). So, while there may be some difference in the absolute level to which political partisans agree or disagree with different narratives, the general pattern of which narratives are most endorsed or disputed is very similar for both Democrats and Republicans.

Policymakers do not support systemic change

Policymakers show a similar pattern to the public in their relative support for narratives for strong action change compared to narratives that propose incremental change or market solutions. However, across most of the narratives, policymakers report significantly less endorsement than the public. In most cases, this difference is minor, but for narratives that emphasize structural change and threats to the status quo (N.12 Systems Change and N.13 Policy Only), policymakers outright disagree with these narratives, while the public is split between agreement and disagreement (see Fig. 2).

When looking at comparisons along political party lines, we see that, again, policymakers largely support these narratives less than members of the public (see Supplementary Note 2 and Supplementary Fig. 2. However, this seems to be largely driven by Democratic policymakers, who showed weaker endorsement for all narratives compared to their constituents, except for N.1 (Policy and Behavior). Meanwhile, Independents and Republicans showed weaker endorsement than their constituents for N.1 (Policy and Behavior), N.12 (Systems Change), and N.13 (Policy Only), but were fairly close to their constituents’ endorsement for all other narratives. The degree of difference between the public and policymakers varies across narratives. For example, while all policymakers support N.12 (Systems Change) less than members of the public, this comparison is most stark for Conservative and Independent policymakers.

Americans and politicians underestimate public support for strong action climate solutions

Respondents’ estimates of what percentage of Americans they thought agreed with each of the narrative statements had some degree of accuracy in the relative order of popularity of these climate narratives—correctly estimating that the more popular narratives were more popular than less popular narratives, but were very inaccurate in recognizing the high absolute levels of support of these narratives. Perceived support was underestimated by 20–30% for many narratives. Unpopular narratives show a greater degree of accuracy, with people only slightly overestimating support for some narratives (N.19 Not Serious, N.20 Future Generations’ Problem) and underestimating support for others (N.16 Anarcho-Reform, N.17 In God’s Hands). However, this greater accuracy among unpopular narratives may be due to the restricted range of popularity perceptions at large. While personal support for each narrative ranged from 29.4 to 85.6% of the American public, public perceptions of narrative agreement center around 50% for most narratives (ranging from 34.4 to 55.8%). This may indicate that people are guessing at what the actual percentage may be or using other heuristics, like partisan political divides, to estimate actual public support, leading to underestimations of support for popular narratives. Nevertheless, the relative pattern of which narratives are perceived to be popular generally follows actual public support for those narratives (Fig. 3).

Policymakers also underestimate the popularity of many strong action climate solutions. While their perceptions align with public perception for most narratives and follow a similar pattern of perceived support, policymakers' perceptions of public support differ from public perceptions on two narratives. Policymakers underestimate public support for N.12 (Systems Change) to an even greater extent than the public and overestimate public support for N.14 (Free Market Solutions). So, while policymakers should be responsive to public attitudes, they share a similar underestimation of public support for action, potentially resulting in inaction compared to true public attitudes. Indeed, in this sample, 61.4% of policymakers reported that constituents’ willingness to take lifestyle action has an impact on their policy support (95% CI [57.1%, 65.6%]). Systematic underestimation of actual support may limit the willingness of representatives to take action and push for policy change.

There are, unsurprisingly, some differences in perceptions of narrative popularity between policymakers from different political parties. For example, Democratic policymakers had higher perceptions of the popularity of N.12 (Systems Change) and N.13 (Policy Only) compared to Republicans, while Republicans had higher perceived support for N.19 (Free Market Solutions) and N.11 (Pro-Incremental Change; see Supplementary Fig. 3 for policymaker perceptions by political party). However, for many narratives, there were relatively smaller differences in norm perceptions between Democrats and Republicans, and there was still a great deal of underestimation for the popularity of some of the most popular narratives.

Endorsement of narratives correlates with personal action and policy support

Narrative agreement was a significant predictor of willingness to take individual lifestyle actions (e.g., shifting to a more sustainable diet, changing transportation practices, and switching to green and efficient energy use), with some narratives positively predicting willingness to act and others relating to and unwillingness to act. The narratives with the strongest relationship to individual lifestyle action were those that emphasized strong individual action (N.1 Policy and Behavior, N.7 Don’t Adapt—Mitigate) and the need for quick, urgent action (N.9 Anti-Incremental Change, N.2 Build Back Better). Meanwhile, narratives that explicitly place responsibility on others (N.20 Future Generations’ Problem, N.15 Climate Deniers’ Fault, N.17 In God’s Hands, N.14 Free Market Solutions), deny its existence (N.19 Not Serious), or downplay the need for drastic lifestyle actions (N.18 Too Late—Adapt, N.11 Pro-Incremental Change) relate to inaction on lifestyle choices. Some narratives that propose a substitute for lifestyle actions (N.10 Ultra-Wealthy Saviors, N.5 Technosalvation) or propose action in an attempt to shift others’ behavior (N.3 Just Educate People, N.8 Ripple Effect) show a modest but still positive relationship. Despite its emphasis on individual action, the narrative emphasizing behavior only had a modest relationship with individual action intentions (Fig. 4).

Participants’ willingness to take political action (i.e., attend a climate protest and contact decision makers) was also directly related to endorsement of climate narratives. As before, narratives that expressed urgency and combined individual and systemic efforts were most strongly related to political action. Surprisingly, despite its emphasis on political action, endorsement of N.13 (Policy Only) was only modestly related to political action, potentially reflecting a lack of belief that individual political action makes a difference, or that people who endorse that narrative do so to avoid personal responsibility.

Agreement with different narratives was also related to support and opposition to mitigation policies (e.g., Carbon Tax, Green New Deal, Renewable energy mandate for utilities). The pattern of which narratives showed the strongest relationships to action replicates which narratives were related to individual lifestyle and political action. N.9 (Anti-incremental Change), N.1 (Policy and Behavior), N.7 (Don’t Adapt—Mitigate), and N.12 (Systems Change) had strong positive relationships with policy support, while denial of climate change’s impacts and emphasizing N.14 (Free Market Solutions) and others’ responsibility negatively related to policy support. As with individual political action, N.13 (Policy Only) showed a modest relationship to mitigation policy support, further showing that endorsement of this narrative may not translate to individual action that supports systemic change.

Experimental effects of exposure to narratives in media on climate action

Experimental exposure to articles that supported six different narratives did not consistently shift willingness to engage in lifestyle change, political action, or policy support compared to a control condition (see Fig. 5). However, a few narratives show small effects on some outcomes (see Supplementary Tables 3 and 4). Exposure to N.1 (Policy and Behavior) resulted in consistently greater self-reported willingness to take personal, collective, and political action relative to the control condition, but only significantly differed from the control in willingness to engage in political action when controlling for demographic factors. Exposure to N.12 (Systems Change) increased willingness to engage in political and lifestyle action (when controlling for other narrative effects and demographics). N.13 (Policy Only) led to higher levels of willingness to engage in political action but not lifestyle action or policy support. Finally, N.18 (Too Late—Adapt) led to increases in political action and policy support as well, when controlling for other narratives and demographic factors (see Supplementary Note 3 for summary of experimental effects).

There are also differences in the effect of the six narratives when compared to each other on each behavioral outcome (see Supplementary Note 4 for pairwise comparisons). Compared to N.13 (Policy Only), N.1 (Policy and Behavior) led to higher levels of willingness to engage in lifestyle action, but there was no difference in political action or policy support. Similarly, though N.1 (Policy and Behavior) and N.18 (Too Late—Adapt) showed small or no differences to control, N.8 (Ripple Effect) was significantly lower than either of them in policy support. In fact, N.18 (Too Late—Adapt) was significantly higher than N.8 (Ripple Effect), N.12 (Systems Change), and N.13 (Policy Only) in policy support, showing a potentially ironic effect where N.13 (Policy Only) may somewhat decrease support for policy change, compared to other narratives. Additionally, though it never differed significantly from control, N.5 (Technosalvation) may be an actively harmful narrative in terms of promoting widespread climate action, as exposure to it significantly lowered intentions about lifestyle action relative to exposure to N.1 (Policy and Behavior), and significantly lowered intentions about political action relative to exposure to N.12 (Systems Change) and N.13 (Policy Only). The statistical significance of these comparisons varied depending on which covariates were included, so further research ought to replicate these findings. However, it seems that there may be small effects of experimental exposure to some narratives, compared to other narratives, even when exposure is brief and occurs only once, suggesting that there may be greater effects of repeated exposure to these narratives over time.

Across three studies using a nationally representative samples of Americans, a large sample of local policymakers, and an experimental intervention on a convenience sample, we find that Americans largely support narratives that call for climate action on multiple fronts, and that endorsement of these narratives is associated with higher levels of willingness to act at the personal, collective, and policy level. Our work shows that people differ in their views about a broad array of climate change solution narratives that encompass both individual and systemic change on multiple fronts, but that not all narratives are equally popular nor equally effective in motivating action. For example, while endorsements of the narratives of N.4 (Behavior Only) or of N.13 (Policy Only) were positively associated with pro-climate actions, these effects were quite modest compared to those associated with endorsement of narratives that advocated for both. Past work has suggested that narratives about individual-only or structural-only solutions might “crowd out” other types of action3. It is possible that by focusing on only one type of change as needed, these narratives might subtly downplay the urgency of the issue, or they might give people an “out” as an excuse for why they do not need to change their lifestyles. However, this past work failed to also consider a “combined” narrative approach, which uses a multi-action framing to motivate behavior of all kinds. Meanwhile, other narratives that are less common (i.e., N.9 Anti-Incremental Change and N.8 Ripple Effect) show strong associations with individual action, suggesting that increasing public exposure to and acceptance of these narratives might increase the frequency of this class of behavior.

Despite partisan differences in how much Republicans and Democrats endorse these narratives, their relative popularity is similar for both types of respondents, with some narratives being popular in both parties (i.e., N.1 Policy and Behavior and N.2 Build Back Better). Communicating this alignment across the aisle in support of popular paths towards sustainability might help to correct actual and perceived intergroup polarization (see23), though some narratives are still disputed across political party lines (i.e., N.20 Future Generations’ Problem and N.18 Too Late—Adapt). Policymakers also show a similar pattern in their relative support of these policies, though they generally endorse them less and are especially non-representative of their constituents in their desire for changes to the social and economic system. So, while there remain partisan differences and differences in public and official endorsement of individual narratives, the general popularity of certain narratives versus others is clear across the aisle.

Both policymakers and the public misperceive the popularity of narratives to take action on multiple fronts. These misperceptions are in some cases quite drastic, with both members of the public and policymakers underestimating support for the most common narratives by 20–30%. Our work showing pluralistic ignorance about narrative endorsement parallels previous work showing how the American public generally underestimates public support for climate action17,24. These results highlight yet another domain where informational interventions aimed at correcting pluralistic ignorance misperceptions may be effective, particularly for policymakers who ought to be aware of the right levels of their constituents’ beliefs and wishes, given that they claim to be influenced by them.

Endorsement of the narratives we tested may not simply be endorsement of actions to be taken by others but may influence individual actions. Our present studies focused on willingness to engage in individual lifestyle and civic actions as well as policy support, finding that certain narratives relate to greater willingness to take actions across multiple outcomes. There are potential differences in the cognitive and behavioral correlates of endorsement of these narratives. Because these narratives differ in potential pathways to solutions as well as potential outcomes (e.g., mitigating climate change versus adaptation), endorsement of these narratives may also be associated with different levels of optimism about addressing climate change, or with different perceptions of what a sustainable future might look like. Similarly, there might be differences in how endorsement of different narratives relates to perceptions of our current economic and political systems that might imply differences in willingness to engage in sanctioned versus non-sanctioned political action (e.g., voting versus radical protest). They may also be related to perceptions of efficacy, with participants making more strategic endorsements of what they think is likely to happen or likely to be effective rather than what they believe is the correct course of action. Motivated perceptions related to efficacy likely also vary by political party: prior research on solution aversion, for example, has found that conservatives are politically motivated to diminish or alter their perceptions of societal problems like climate change based on how averse they are to commonly proposed solutions25, Future work should strive to further explore how endorsement of different narratives relates to justifications of and intentions to engage in different types of climate action, as well as beliefs about individual and collective efficacy across narratives.

While endorsements of these narratives were related to willingness to take action, a one-time experimental exposure to one of six of these narratives had more limited effects. Presenting a narrative advocating for both policy and behavior change as gaining prominence shifted participants towards greater willingness to take action in both their lifestyle choices and engagement with political systems, though these effects did not always reach statistical significance (perhaps because N.1 Policy and Behavior as a narrative is already widely endorsed, resulting in ceiling effects). Our result dovetails with the strong relationship this narrative has to self-reported behavior at a correlational level, giving further credence to its merits.

It does seem that political action intentions were the most malleable of the outcomes measured, as they were significantly increased by several experimental conditions. It is worth noting that this may be due to differences in base-rate comparisons. In the control condition, we see evidence of a floor effect for political action intentions (M = 2.08, SD = 1.19) compared to both lifestyle action (M = 3.05, SD = 1.01) and policy support (M = 4.07, SD = 1.38), so there is greater room for improvement in this outcome. However, there are also theoretical reasons that might explain why we observe more and greater effects for this outcome. First, people may already be more set in their ways for policy support and lifestyle actions. Everyday habits are hard to change, and people may already have set routines for the lifestyle actions examined. The public may also already have preconceived notions about popular policies or have more strict opinions about the particulars of the policies proposed. As a result, the political actions measured may feel more plastic and easier to commit to than larger, ongoing commitments like becoming vegan. So, political action intentions may be more malleable than other outcomes, though this would require further testing.

From the experimental evidence of Study 3 alone, we cannot claim a strong causal effect of exposure to this or other narratives. However, there do seem to be some positive effects, suggesting that these narratives have the potential to increase behavioral intentions and policy support. Future work might delve further into these narratives and how they affect behavioral choices, especially when they are pitted against each other or when people are exposed to them repeatedly, reflecting the real-life conversations that occur around climate change.

Given the cross-sectional nature of some of these studies, there are limitations that should be noted. First, the relationships between narrative endorsement and willingness to act should be replicated using actual behavioral measures, not just self-reports of behavior and behavioral intentions. Behavioral intentions are not guaranteed to lead to behavior26,27, but are important precursors for action as outlined in prominent psychological theories of behavior28,29. They are, therefore, useful indicators in research aiming to test a wide breadth of messages, because if a message shuts down willingness/intentions, then it would be unlikely to lead to behavior change. Nevertheless, future work should extend this to examine messaging effects on actual behavior. Second, though we have some experimental evidence to suggest that exposure to narratives might motivate behavior, it is unclear if narrative endorsement leads to behavioral outcomes or if narrative endorsement is motivated to justify people’s preexisting behaviors, intentions, or beliefs. Further experimental and longitudinal studies should aim to address this limitation by tracking how narrative endorsement and behavior change track together over time.

Additionally, the participants may have experienced respondent burden or fatigue in Study 1. The median survey time was around 15 min and participants rated 20 discrete narratives, both for their own agreement as well as estimates of national support. There were steps in place to help reduce participant burden. For example, the climate narratives were kept to a short length (1–2 sentences), and the order of the narratives was randomized so that any fatigue effects were evenly spread. Participant burden could have the effect of reducing contrasts between narratives, meaning that differences observed in our data may be conservative estimates. To avoid possible fatigue, future work could assess fewer narratives in total, possibly showing participants a random subset rather than showing all participants all items.

Our work also focused only on prominent climate narratives within the U.S. and assessed each of them one at a time. It is possible that some narratives share common features that could be assembled into a loose taxonomy of narratives (e.g., narratives that have any level of governmental action). Understanding what these common features might be, and their psychological roots, might lead to predictable downstream impacts for these narratives, as well as for narratives that might develop in other cultural contexts or in the future as climate change impacts and technologies to address these impacts advance. Future work could continue to explore how narratives might relate to one another and share common threads.

Despite these limitations, the present work presents evidence that certain climate narratives may motivate climate action. There are also some theoretical questions that can be addressed by future work: Are some narratives more effective at motivating action because they directly involve and empower the individual? Or because they underline the urgency and need for drastic and far-reaching actions? How specific or general should these narratives be? Additionally, how do mixtures of narrative exposures take hold? Even though our work treated these narratives as independent of each other, it is unlikely that any of these narratives exists in a vacuum. Future work can explore how these narratives might substitute for or complement each other, how the salience of one diminishes or enhances the salience of others, and how endorsement of some may be strategic to justify other narratives or one’s previous actions.

Our work also does not answer the question of why there is such a large gap between the actual and perceived endorsement of these narratives. Public misperceptions might be biased by common norm signals, such as general governmental inaction30 or by the expressed opinions of the economic and social elite31, but why public perceptions lag more for some narratives than others remains an open question. It also remains an open question as to whether policymakers' misperceptions are based on the same biases as their constituents or if they are motivated and willful underestimations to maintain the status quo. It is possible that both willful and unconscious biases lead to these misperceptions, and future work can attempt to document these biases as well as investigate methods to alleviate their impact.

Our work can also be expanded to explore both more precise and more abstract or broad narratives than the ones investigated here. Our work was an exploratory study, examining common narratives in the American discourse to get a broader lay of the land. As such, the narratives were abstract enough not to mention specific policies or actions, but more specific than broader beliefs about the urgency and need for climate action overall. This allowed us to examine the overall endorsement of these narratives in one systematic study, complementing prior research that examines specific policies and practices in a piecemeal fashion. Of course, more precision is key when specific plans are closer to being implemented, but it is still an open question whether lay audiences pay attention to the details of these policies rather than focus on what the policy is about at a high level. More narrative research must be done to understand how people think about these narratives and the connection between specific policies and corresponding, broader narratives. There are many open questions for future investigation, but the current work provides an important first step into understanding the determinants and consequences of endorsement of different climate narratives.

This research was approved by the ethical boards of Princeton University and Indiana University. In all studies, informed consent was received from all participants. Full survey items and materials for all studies are available on OSF. All inferential tests were run using linear regression models (assuming two-tailed tests), with either narrative endorsement as the predictor (Study 1) or binary categorical variables to indicate experimental condition (Study 3). In all cases, models were run both with and without additional demographic covariates.

Study 1

A representative sample (N = 1500) of the United States in the summer of 2021 through Qualtrics, which ensured basic data quality standards (e.g., filtering out participants who selected the same response across many items, provided free responses that were gibberish, or completed the survey in under half the median time). There was one attention check near the end of the survey to filter out inattentive participants: participants were asked what the survey was primarily about and given a multiple-choice question with one obviously correct answer (“Climate Change”). Qualtrics provided data on 2058 participants, of which 73.6% passed the included attention check, resulting in 1508 participants for analysis. Representative quotas were attained factoring in the attention check drop criteria such that the sample greatly resembles the U.S. population in terms of age, gender, race and ethnicity, education, household income, political party identification, and region of the country (see Supplementary Table 5 for full demographics and comparison to U.S. demographic targets). Power analysis, using G*Power32 including the software’s default assumptions (e.g., normal distribution of data) for within and between subjects comparisons (t-tests), was conducted to estimate the necessary sample size. A sample size of 1500 was chosen as it is more than 80% powered to detect very small differences within subjects (e.g., the popularity between narratives, dz = 0.07) and small differences between subjects (e.g., partisan differences, d = 0.18).

First, participants answered some demographic items and were told they would be asked how much they agreed or disagreed with a variety of statements about climate change. We also provided a brief definition of “policy changes” and “lifestyle changes” pertaining to climate change mitigation to clarify these terms as they appear in the narratives. Participants were then asked to the extent they agreed with each of the twenty narratives (displayed simultaneously, narrative order was randomized). Next, participants indicated to what extent they were willing to engage in various climate mitigation actions, including a set of five lifestyle actions (e.g., avoid flying) and two political actions (e.g., participate in a climate protest) displayed in a random order. Respondents answered these questions on a scale from “very unwilling”1 to “very willing”6, with “I already do this” as a 7th point on the scale, allowing for participants to express a range of willingness, including ongoing actions they engaged in. Following this, participants answered the degree to which they supported six climate mitigation policies on a scale from “strongly oppose”1 to “strongly support”6. Each policy had a paragraph-long description explaining the basic aims of the policy. The policies capture a range of major climate mitigation policies being considered, including a carbon tax, 100% state-wide renewable energy mandates, phase-out of internal combustion engine vehicles, a Green New Deal, and the American Jobs Plan. Participants then reported how they felt about climate change on a day-to-day basis, including the extent to which they felt a sense of urgency, felt engaged in addressing it, and were impacted by it on a scale from “not at all”1 to “very much”5.

Next, participants were asked to estimate what percent of Americans would agree with each narrative (order randomized), followed by what percent of Americans they thought were willing to engage in each of the climate mitigation behaviors, reporting their estimates as a percentage. Participants ended the survey by answering the attention check, and reporting final demographics, including political orientation.

Study 2

A CivicPulse panel was commissioned to recruit a representative sample (N = 500) of local government policymakers in the United States (i.e., governing board members and top elected officials representative of all townships, municipalities, and counties in the United States with a population of 1000 or more) in the spring of 2021. CivicPulse ensured basic data quality standards, including filtering out participants who give low-quality or incomplete responses, and provided data on 536 local policymakers for analysis, with sample weights to ensure representativeness. Power analysis, using G*Power32 with standard assumptions (e.g., normal distribution of data) for within and between subjects comparisons (t-tests), was conducted to estimate the necessary sample size. A sample size of 500 was targeted to be more than 80% powered to detect small differences within subjects (e.g., the popularity between narratives, dz = 0.12) and small differences between the policymaker and public sample in Study 1 (e.g., differences in narrative endorsement, d = 0.15).

Participants were asked the extent to which they (dis)agreed with eight of the narratives from Study 1 (with narrative order randomized), specifically: N.1 (Policy and Behavior), N.13 (Policy Only), N.4 (Behavior Only), N.5 (Technosalvation), N.11 (Pro-Incremental Change), N. 12 (Systems Change), N.14 (Free Market Solutions), and N.18 (Too Late—Adapt). This subset of narratives were selected based on a number of criteria including: narratives that greatly correlated with taking action in our Pilot Study (e.g., N.1 Policy and Behavior), narratives that policymakers may differ from the public on or that favor the status quo or neoliberal approaches to address climate change (e.g., N.11 Pro-Incremental Change, N.14 Free Market Solutions, and N.12 Systems Change), narratives that do not rely on major policy changes to achieve change and thus may avoid a sense of policymaker responsibility (e.g. N.4 Behavior Only and N.5 Technosalvation), and narratives that deal with pessimism about mitigation and deflection to adaptation (e.g., N.18 Too Late—Adapt). We avoided narratives that greatly overlapped with the opposite of the chosen narratives (e.g., N.9 Anti-Incremental Change) and those that were unpopular among the public and would likely be unpopular among policymakers as well (e.g., N.16 Anarcho-Reform).

Next, participants were asked whether they would support climate policy to a greater extent if their constituents signaled they cared about climate change by making major changes in their lifestyle to live more sustainably. Lastly, participants were asked to estimate what percent of Americans would agree with each narrative (order randomized).

Study 3

A pilot study was conducted to ensure that all manipulation materials shifted endorsement of their corresponding narratives. A sample of adults in the U.S. (N = 462) was recruited on Prolific, randomly assigned to conditions, then presented with the intended manipulation materials. After this, participants rated their agreement with all narratives tested. Results indicated that the manipulation materials generally worked as intended, increasing endorsement of that narrative (see Supplementary Note 5 and Supplementary Table 6).

For Study 3, a sample of adults in the U.S. (N = 2185) was recruited in the spring of 2022 for a “6–9 min Psychology Survey” on Prolific for $0.95. Prolific users were prescreened for unique IP addresses and political party identification to ensure that the sample was balanced in party identification to match national levels in the U.S. based on averaging Gallup polling over the year leading up to the survey (27% Republican, 43% Independent, 30% Democrat;33). Power analysis, using G*Power32 with standard assumptions (e.g., normal distribution of data) for within and between subjects comparisons (t-tests), was conducted to estimate the necessary sample size. A minimum sample size of N = 1960 (280 participants for each of seven conditions) was determined to achieve more than 80% power to detect medium-small condition effects (d = 0.25), plus roughly 10% for participants who may be dropped from analysis for failing the attention check. A priori, it was decided to include two drop criteria that were implemented in Study 1: First, an attention check to filter out inattentive participants near the end of the survey, where participants were asked what the survey was primarily about and given a multiple choice question with one obviously correct answer (“Climate Change”); and second, removing participants who completed the survey too quickly to have thoughtfully responded to question (less than one-half the median time). Two participants failed the attention check and were removed from analyses. Of those remaining, 123 (5.6%) took less than half the median time and were removed from analyses; this criterion did not differ by condition, χ2 (6, N = 2,183) = 6.76, p = 0.344. After these drop criteria, 2060 participants remained, exceeding our original target.

In the first portion of the study, participants were randomly assigned to read a collection of headlines and quotes from popular media outlets that supported one of six narratives (or nothing if they were randomly assigned to the control condition [n = 306]). The six narrative conditions (Policy and Behavior [n = 288], Policy Only [n = 299], Ripple Effect [n = 291], Technosalvation [n = 288], Systems Change [n = 289], and Too Late—Adapt [n = 299]) were selected given a combination of factors including: their frequency in popular media, their importance in current discourse or debate among climate experts and figureheads, whether they possessed a rationale that may motivate personal and political action, and novelty of study (e.g., we did not test whether denying that climate change is important lowered willingness to act as similar research already exists34). Before reading the headlines, participants were told that “A growing consensus finds that [brief description of narrative]” to induce the idea that this narrative was commonly discussed and agreed upon. After reading the collection of headlines and quotes, participants were asked to reflect on what they read and summarize the main argument of the media coverage in 1–2 sentences.

After the manipulation, participants were asked about their motivation to engage in a variety of pro-environmental actions and their expressed support for climate policies. The pro-environmental actions included both individual lifestyle actions (e.g., avoid flying when possible) and political actions (e.g., participate in a climate protest). For each pro-environmental action, participants responded on a scale from “not at all motivated”1 to “very motivated”5. Then, for six climate policies (e.g., Green New Deal), participants were given a brief description of the policy and how much they supported each policy from “strongly oppose”1 to “strongly support”6.

After completing these measures, participants then reported how they felt about climate change, including the extent to which they felt a sense of urgency, felt engaged in addressing it, and were impacted by it on a 5-point scale from “not at all”1 to “very much”5. They were then shown each of the six narratives and expressed their personal agreement with each narrative from “strongly disagree”1 to “strongly agree”6. Finally, participants completed a collection of demographic measures.

Despite their promising potential, Smackover lithium projects face several significant challenges that must be addressed to achieve commercial success.","Understanding the Smackover Formation Lithium Potential

The Smackover Formation stretches across parts of Arkansas, Texas, and Louisiana, representing one of North America's most promising lithium brine resources. This Jurassic-era geological formation, initially known for its oil and gas deposits, has gained significant attention for containing lithium-rich brines that can be accessed using advanced extraction technologies.

Formed approximately 150 million years ago from an ancient shallow sea, the Smackover Formation consists of limestone and dolomite layers saturated with mineral-rich brines. These naturally occurring brines contain lithium concentrations that make commercial extraction economically viable, particularly as lithium demand continues to surge for electric vehicle batteries and energy storage systems.

What Makes the Smackover Formation Unique?

The Smackover Formation offers several distinctive advantages compared to other lithium resources. Unlike the hard-rock lithium mines of Australia or the vast evaporation ponds of South America's ""Lithium Triangle,"" Smackover's lithium exists in subsurface brines that can be accessed through wells, similar to oil and gas extraction.

This geological configuration allows for the application of Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) technologies—advanced methods that can selectively extract lithium from brines without requiring large evaporation ponds or extensive processing. The formation's porosity and permeability characteristics make it particularly suitable for these innovative extraction approaches.

Strategic Importance to US Battery Supply Chain

The Smackover Formation represents a crucial component in America's strategy to reduce dependence on imported lithium. As of mid-2025, the United States imports more than 95% of its lithium, creating potential supply vulnerabilities for its growing electric vehicle and energy storage industries.

The region offers several strategic advantages for domestic lithium production:

Existing infrastructure: Decades of oil and gas operations have established roads, utilities, and drilling capabilities that can be leveraged for lithium production

Favorable regulatory environment: Arkansas has implemented specific frameworks to facilitate lithium development

Proximity to manufacturing: The central U.S. location provides logistical advantages for supplying battery gigafactories being developed across the country

Reduced geopolitical risk: Domestic production mitigates supply chain vulnerabilities associated with international sources

According to industry experts, the Smackover Formation could potentially supply a significant percentage of U.S. lithium needs if multiple projects reach commercial scale. This would represent a major shift in the domestic battery-grade lithium refinery supply chain landscape.

Who Are the Key Players Developing Smackover Lithium Projects?

The race to develop Smackover's lithium resources has attracted major energy companies and specialized lithium developers, each bringing unique expertise to these projects. The entrance of oil and gas majors into this space signals the formation's potential significance in the critical minerals energy transition.

Standard Lithium-Equinor Joint Venture

One of the most advanced Smackover lithium initiatives is the joint venture between Standard Lithium, a lithium development company, and Equinor, the Norwegian energy major. Their partnership combines Standard Lithium's DLE technology expertise with Equinor's subsurface knowledge and project development capabilities.

The joint venture is targeting commercial production by mid-2028, with a final investment decision expected by the end of 2025. Their development approach involves a phased scaling strategy, starting with demonstration facilities before expanding to commercial-scale operations.

Lisa Rebora, Equinor's Global Head of Lithium, emphasized the complementary nature of their partnership at the 2025 Fastmarkets Lithium Conference:

""Standard Lithium is a strong technology partner; Equinor brings subsurface expertise. This combination allows us to optimize flow sheets and technology to reduce costs.""

David Park, Standard Lithium's CEO, reinforced their long-term perspective at the same conference:

""We're focused on long-term lithium demand beyond 2028. While controlling what we can: derisking projects and securing offtake agreements.""

The joint venture has already received regulatory approvals, including the critical 2.5% royalty rate structure approved in May 2025, positioning them for advanced engineering studies and investment decisions.

Saltwerx (ExxonMobil Subsidiary)

ExxonMobil entered the Smackover lithium race through its subsidiary Saltwerx, leveraging its extensive oil and gas experience in the region. In June 2025, Saltwerx received approval from the Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission for a 2.5% royalty rate—matching the rate previously approved for the Standard Lithium-Equinor joint venture.

Patrick Horwath, ExxonMobil's Lithium Global Business Director, described this regulatory milestone as pivotal:

""The royalty approval was the last main regulatory step… Now it's time for us to deliver our projects.""

Exxon's approach leverages its deep understanding of subsurface geology and fluid movement, which has already yielded operational efficiencies in preliminary development work. For instance, the company has reduced drilling time to target depths by applying techniques refined through decades of oil and gas operations.

Horwath further emphasized how oil and gas expertise transfers to lithium extraction:

""Understanding brine movement through columns unlocks capacity – a skill transferred from oil/gas.""

Saltwerx is now advancing its engineering studies and preparing for project development decisions, though it has not yet publicly announced a specific production timeline.

Other Emerging Players in the Region

The Smackover's potential has attracted additional energy majors. Notably, Chevron recently acquired two leases in the region, validating the formation's prospects. While Chevron has not yet detailed its development plans, the company's entrance represents further institutional validation of the Smackover's commercial viability.

Several smaller specialized lithium developers are also exploring opportunities in the formation, potentially creating a diverse ecosystem of producers with varying scales and approaches. This competitive landscape could accelerate innovation while ensuring the region's resources are developed efficiently.

How Does Direct Lithium Extraction Technology Work in Smackover?

The development of Smackover lithium projects relies on Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) technologies—advanced methods that represent a significant departure from traditional lithium production techniques. Understanding these technologies is crucial to appreciating why the Smackover Formation has attracted such substantial investment.

DLE Technology Advantages for Brine Resources

Unlike conventional lithium production that relies on solar evaporation ponds (which can take 18-24 months to concentrate lithium), DLE technologies can extract lithium directly from brines in hours or days. The process typically follows these steps:

Brine is pumped to the surface through wells similar to those used in oil and gas production

The brine undergoes pretreatment to remove impurities that might interfere with lithium extraction

Lithium is selectively extracted via specialized adsorption or ion-exchange materials that preferentially bind to lithium ions

The lithium is recovered from these materials through a stripping process

The depleted brine is reinjected into the formation, minimizing water consumption and environmental impact

This approach offers several significant advantages:

Reduced environmental footprint: Eliminates the need for large evaporation ponds that can span thousands of acres

Higher recovery rates: Achieves over 90% lithium recovery versus 40-60% in traditional evaporation methods

Faster production timeline: Reduces processing time from years to days

Water conservation: Enables the return of processed brine to the formation

Smaller surface footprint: Requires significantly less land area than evaporation pond operations

These benefits address many of the sustainability concerns associated with traditional lithium production while potentially improving economic outcomes through faster time-to-market and higher recovery rates.

Adapting Oil & Gas Expertise to Lithium Extraction

Companies developing Smackover lithium resources are leveraging significant crossover between oil and gas operations and DLE implementation. The skills and knowledge transfer creates unique advantages for these projects.

Key transferable capabilities include:

Subsurface characterization: Understanding formation properties to optimize well placement

Drilling efficiency: Applying proven techniques to reduce costs and improve accuracy

Flow management: Optimizing brine movement through extraction systems

Risk assessment: Utilizing established protocols from hydrocarbon production

Project management: Applying large-scale energy project expertise to lithium development

Lisa Rebora of Equinor highlighted this knowledge transfer during industry panel discussions, noting how their subsurface modeling expertise helps optimize brine extraction and reinjection strategies. Similarly, ExxonMobil's Patrick Horwath emphasized how understanding fluid dynamics in porous media—a core oil and gas competency—directly applies to DLE operations.

This convergence of traditional energy expertise with innovative extraction technologies positions Smackover projects to potentially achieve operational efficiencies not available to greenfield lithium developments elsewhere.

What Recent Regulatory Developments Impact Smackover Lithium Projects?

The regulatory landscape for Smackover lithium projects has evolved significantly in recent years, with several key developments creating a more supportive environment for project advancement. These regulatory milestones have been critical in de-risking investments and establishing clear operational frameworks.

Royalty Rate Approvals and Their Significance

One of the most significant regulatory developments came in June 2025, when the Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission approved a 2.5% royalty rate for Saltwerx (ExxonMobil's subsidiary). This followed a similar approval for the Standard Lithium-Equinor joint venture in May 2025, establishing consistency across major projects in the region.

The royalty structure is based on the total value of lithium production, calculated using the quarterly average of Fastmarkets' assessment of lithium carbonate prices. As of June 27, 2025, this benchmark stood at $11.25-12.50 per kg, with the Q2 2025 average price at $11.73 per kg (down from $11.93 per kg in Q1 2025).

Patrick Horwath of ExxonMobil described the royalty approval as ""the last main regulatory step"" needed before projects can advance to final engineering studies and investment decisions. This standardized approach provides clarity for developers and helps establish the economic parameters for project evaluation.

The royalty framework represents a balance between generating state revenue and maintaining project competitiveness in global markets. By tying rates to market prices rather than imposing fixed fees, the structure accommodates market fluctuations while ensuring the state benefits from higher prices during market upswings.

Arkansas State Support for Lithium Development

Beyond specific royalty approvals, the Arkansas state government has implemented a comprehensive strategy to support lithium sector development. These initiatives aim to create an ecosystem that extends beyond extraction to include downstream processing and manufacturing.

Key elements of Arkansas' lithium development strategy include:

Economic incentives: Tax benefits specifically designed for lithium production and processing

Workforce development: Programs to train local workers in collaboration with community colleges

Innovation support: Creation of an ""accelerator"" program to foster lithium-sector entrepreneurship

Industry collaboration: Hosting the Arkansas Lithium Innovation Summit (scheduled for October 28-29, 2025)

Infrastructure investment: Strategic improvements to support industry growth

Hugh McDonald, Arkansas Commerce Secretary, emphasized this comprehensive approach at industry conferences:

""We're working to attract battery manufacturers to Arkansas… leveraging lithium produced in-state.""

This state-level support complements federal initiatives under the Inflation Reduction Act, which provides incentives for domestic critical mineral production and battery manufacturing. Together, these policies create a supportive environment for Smackover lithium development that extends from extraction through the value chain.

How Are Market Conditions Affecting Smackover Development Plans?

Despite the strategic importance of developing domestic lithium resources, Smackover projects must navigate market realities that influence investment decisions and development timelines. Understanding current market conditions and long-term fundamentals provides crucial context for evaluating project viability.

Navigating the Current Lithium Price Environment

The lithium market has experienced significant volatility in recent years. After reaching historic highs in 2022-2023, prices have undergone a substantial correction. As of June 2025, Fastmarkets assessed lithium carbonate prices at $11.25-12.50 per kg—well below previous peaks but still above historical averages.

Recent price trends show continued softening, with the Q2 2025 average price of $11.73 per kg representing a 1.7% decline from the Q1 2025 average of $11.93 per kg. This downward pressure reflects increased supply coming online globally, temporarily outpacing demand growth.

Companies developing Smackover resources are responding to these market conditions by:

Optimizing project economics to ensure viability at lower price points

Phasing development to manage capital expenditure timing

Securing strategic partnerships and offtake agreements

Focusing on operational efficiency and cost reduction

Emphasizing the premium value of domestic production

David Park, Standard Lithium's CEO, articulated this approach at industry conferences, emphasizing their focus on ""controlling what we can: derisking projects and securing offtake agreements"" rather than reacting to short-term price movements.

Long-Term Market Outlook Beyond Current Downturn

Despite current market softness, companies developing Smackover lithium resources maintain a decidedly long-term perspective. Their investment decisions reflect confidence in lithium demand growth driven by electric vehicle adoption and energy storage deployment.

Patrick Horwath of ExxonMobil captured this multi-decade view:

""We take a multi-decade view; the world needs more lithium than produced today.""

This long-term outlook is supported by several fundamental factors:

Electric vehicle growth projections: Major automakers have committed hundreds of billions to electrification

Battery manufacturing expansion: Gigafactory announcements continue despite market volatility

Energy storage deployment: Grid-scale battery installations are accelerating globally

Policy support: Governments worldwide are implementing measures to accelerate the energy transition

Companies are positioning Smackover projects to come online around 2028—a timeline that aligns with projected supply gaps as EV adoption accelerates. This strategic timing could allow projects to avoid current market oversupply while preparing for the next demand surge.

The current market environment may ultimately strengthen Smackover projects by enforcing cost discipline and operational efficiency during the development phase. Projects that advance through this challenging period may emerge more resilient and competitive in the long run.

What Challenges Must Smackover Lithium Projects Overcome?

Despite their promising potential, Smackover lithium projects face several significant challenges that must be addressed to achieve commercial success. These hurdles range from technical and operational issues to broader supply chain and infrastructure constraints.

Technical and Operational Hurdles

Developing commercial-scale DLE operations in the Smackover Formation involves overcoming several technical challenges:

Technology optimization: DLE technologies must be fine-tuned for the specific chemical composition of Smackover brines, which contain various impurities and competing ions that can affect extraction efficiency.

Scale-up risks: Moving from pilot operations to commercial-scale production introduces complexities in maintaining consistent performance and recovery rates.

Operational integration: Combining extraction, processing, and reinjection systems requires careful engineering to ensure reliable operation.

Quality control: Producing battery-grade lithium compounds requires consistent purity levels that meet stringent specifications.

Water management: Optimizing water use and ensuring proper handling of process fluids presents ongoing operational challenges.

Project developers are addressing these challenges through extensive pilot testing, engineering studies, and collaboration with technology providers. The involvement of major energy companies brings valuable experience in managing complex extraction operations, potentially mitigating some of these technical risks.

Supply Chain and Infrastructure Development Needs

Perhaps the most significant challenge facing Smackover lithium projects is the lack of midstream processing infrastructure in the United States. Patrick Horwath of ExxonMobil highlighted this critical gap:

""The US lacks midstream cathode capacity – a critical gap for supply chains.""

This infrastructure deficit includes:

Limited refining capacity: Insufficient facilities to convert lithium chloride or hydroxide to battery-grade materials

Underdeveloped cathode production: Few domestic manufacturers of lithium-ion battery cathodes

Logistics constraints: Underdeveloped transportation networks for lithium chemicals

Workforce gaps: Shortage of skilled workers with relevant experience in lithium processing

Addressing these gaps requires coordination between project developers, downstream manufacturers, and government agencies. Hugh McDonald, Arkansas Commerce Secretary, emphasized state efforts to address these challenges through an ""accelerator"" program designed to foster lithium-sector entrepreneurship and attract complementary businesses.

Industry leaders note that establishing complete supply chains—from extraction through battery manufacturing—represents both a challenge and opportunity. Projects that can integrate vertically or establish strategic partnerships across the value chain may gain competitive advantages while addressing infrastructure gaps.

How Does Smackover Compare to Global Lithium Sources?

As Smackover lithium projects advance toward production, they must compete in a global marketplace with established producers and other emerging resources. Understanding this competitive landscape is essential for assessing the long-term viability and strategic importance of these projects.

Competitive Position Analysis

Smackover lithium projects face competition from several established and emerging global sources:

Australian hard rock mines: Currently the world's largest lithium source, with established supply chains and expansion potential thanks to Australian lithium tax breaks

Chilean and Argentine salars: Traditional brine operations with decades of production experience and evolving lithium brine market insights

The Senate narrowly passed its version of President Donald Trump’s so-called “one big, beautiful” bill Tuesday, followed by the House on Thursday.
On the energy front, the legislation aims to thwart the nation’s build out of clean energy, including wind and solar, while incentivizing coal, oil and gas production.
Collins cited the bill’s clean energy rollbacks in a statement explaining her ‘no’ vote.
The budget megabill could lead to a loss of 760,000 jobs nationally by 2030 and average household energy costs increasing $170 per year over the next decade according to a recent analysis from Energy Innovations, an energy and climate think tank.","On Tuesday morning, hundreds of thousands of Mainers woke up to higher electricity bills. Central Maine Power’s rate hike, its second in as many years, was largely driven by the utility’s need to recover costs from severe storms in the last few years — the type of extreme weather events that are becoming more frequent and severe due to global climate change. The average household’s monthly bill is expected to jump by about $5, or 3.3 percent, one year after a roughly $10 monthly increase.

As Mainers prepared to reach deeper into their bank accounts to help bankroll the mounting impacts of fossil fuel-driven climate change on energy infrastructure, Republicans in Congress advanced a massive budget bill that is likely to further drive up energy costs and deliver a blow to renewable energy projects, energy efficiency programs and climate action in Maine and across the country.

The Senate narrowly passed its version of President Donald Trump’s so-called “one big, beautiful” bill Tuesday, followed by the House on Thursday. The legislation now heads to Trump’s desk. On the energy front, the legislation aims to thwart the nation’s build out of clean energy, including wind and solar, while incentivizing coal, oil and gas production.

In its current form, the bill would rapidly phase out Biden administration-era tax credits for wind and solar projects, requiring those projects to either break ground within one year or come online by the end of 2027 to access the credits; eliminate tax credits for new and used electric vehicles purchased after Sept. 30 of this year; repeal Inflation Reduction Act funding for numerous emission-reduction programs; and terminate tax credits for home energy efficiency upgrades, including rooftop solar, electric heat pumps and insulation, at the end of 2025.

“The passage of this bill is going to raise prices for consumers, it is going to cut wages for workers and it’s going to make us more reliant on natural gas, which is incredibly expensive right now,” Scott Cuddy, a former state representative and current director of membership development at the the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local Union 1253, told The Maine Monitor. “We’re just looking at losing, losing and losing.”

Maine’s entire congressional delegation — Sens. Susan Collins (R) and Angus King (I) and Reps. Chellie Pingree (D) and Jared Golden (D) — voted against the package. Collins cited the bill’s clean energy rollbacks in a statement explaining her ‘no’ vote.

“The tax credits that energy entrepreneurs have relied on should have been gradually phased out so as not to waste the work that has already been put into these innovative new projects and prevent them from being completed,” she said. “The bill should have also retained incentives for Maine families who choose to install heat pumps and residential solar panels.”

Ahead of the Senate vote, dozens of Maine organizations, businesses, community leaders and labor unions sent a letter urging the two Senators to oppose the bill’s proposed cuts to clean energy investments.

Anya Fetcher, federal policy advocate at the Natural Resource Council of Maine, one of the organizations that signed onto the letter, noted that the bill threatens to slow Maine’s transition to local renewable energy and in turn “prolong the amount of time it takes to drive down energy costs for households and for Maine to reach its [climate] goals.”

The Republican push to get Trump’s policy agenda across the finish line comes on the heels of Maine Democratic Gov. Janet Mills signing into law a bill to speed up the state’s transition away from polluting energy sources, with a new target of reaching 100 percent clean electricity by 2040.

To date, clean energy funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act, both of which were passed during the Biden administration, have supported nearly $3 billion in direct and public-private investments in Maine, according to NRCM’s analysis of data from Rhodium Group’s Clean Investment Monitor.

The budget megabill could lead to a loss of 760,000 jobs nationally by 2030 and average household energy costs increasing $170 per year over the next decade according to a recent analysis from Energy Innovations, an energy and climate think tank.

In Maine, 1,600 jobs are forecast to evaporate and average household energy costs are expected to rise $80 per year by 2035, Dan O’Brien, a senior modeling analyst at Energy Innovation and one of the authors of the report, told The Maine Monitor after crunching state-level data.

“Maine already has quite high power prices,” O’Brien said in an email. “But by passing a renewable standard last month, the legislature is effectively shielding Mainers from some of the price spikes and volatility of imported thermal fuels. Sure, the cost of adding new renewables will go up due to repealed tax credits, but there will be so much less gas and petroleum use on the grid that power prices won’t increase to quite the same degree as in states with heavy grid fossil reliance.”

Yet Maine began feeling impacts of the GOP budget bill well before this week’s legislative battle on Capitol Hill, with at least two planned solar projects — a 100 megawatt facility in Cherryfield and a 140-megawatt array in Hartland — being put on hold and hours for union electricians quickly drying up, according to Cuddy.

Given the climate threat that Maine and the rest of the country is facing, Cuddy views the legislation as worse than the old idiom “cutting off your nose to spite your face.”

“We’re like blasting our nose off our face,” he said. “We’re using TNT up each nostril to blow our nose off of our face here. We are injuring ourselves economically in the short term, and in the long term we are making the problem that is causing some of our economic woes even worse. The bill just confounds me.”

“We’ve been working to sell people on this concept of win, win, win: We fight climate change, we create good jobs, we help the environment and we save people money,” he added. “That’s what we’re doing away with.”",https://themainemonitor.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Susan-Collins-062025.jpg,N,,2025-07-04 12:21:21.695007

“Thanks to President Trump’s leadership, the historic One Big Beautiful Bill will soon be the law of the land.
It rewards hard work, fuels growth on Main Street, and puts more money back in the pockets of Iowa families.","DES MOINES, Iowa — Iowa political leaders are reacting to President Donald Trump's mega bill crossing the finish line through Congress after House Republicans passed the bill on Thursday.

The multi-trillion tax and spending cut package was narrowly approved, 218-214, and has elicited significant opposition. All four of Iowa's U.S. representatives voted in favor of the bill, a vote that came hours ahead of Trump's visit to Des Moines.

During a record-breaking speech that delayed the final vote, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., called the legislation ""immoral.""

“I never thought that I’d be on the House floor saying that this is a crime scene,” Jeffries said. “It’s a crime scene, going after the health, and the safety, and the well-being of the American people.”

At almost 900 pages, the massive bill is full of GOP priorities including $4.5 trillion in tax cuts, adding a temporary tax deduction on tips, overtime and auto loans, as well as providing $350 billion towards the U.S.-Mexico border wall and Trump's mass deportation efforts.

To counter the decreased tax revenue and increased spending, Republicans targeted social safety net programs. Among other things, the bill sets an 80-hour per month work requirement for certain adults receiving Medicaid coverage and food stamps.

Before the bill's passing, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected that 11.8 million more Americans would become uninsured by 2034 and an additional 3 million people would not qualify for SNAP. In totality, the legislation would grow federal deficits by almost $3.3 trillion over the next decade.

The bill now heads to the president's desk, with Trump planning to sign it into law on Friday.

Here's how Iowa politicians reacted to the bill's passage.

Local 5 will update this story as more reactions pour in.

""The One Big Beautiful Bill delivers exactly where Americans need it to.

First, it delivers real tax relief to working families. By eliminating federal income taxes on tips and overtime pay, it rewards hustle, it doesn’t punish it. That’s a stark contrast to the old Washington model of taxing ambition. If you're putting in the extra hours, Washington shouldn’t take the extra paycheck.

Second, it finally puts an end to the chaos at our southern border. While Iowa might be far from the southern border, fentanyl, human trafficking, and cartel violence aren't. To help address the crisis created by the Biden Administration’s open border, this bill funds the wall, empowers our Border Patrol agents, and sends a clear message: America is a nation of laws, and we will enforce them.

And third, the bill restores a fundamental American principle—public assistance should be a hand up, not a lifestyle. By requiring able-bodied adults to work, volunteer, or train as a condition of receiving benefits, the bill reinforces the dignity of work. There’s pride and purpose in earning a paycheck, and we should never let government dependency take that away. It’s not harsh to expect work if someone is able—it’s honest. And it’s what the vast majority of Americans support.

In short, the One Big Beautiful Bill reflects what everyday Americans believe—work should be rewarded, laws should be enforced, and government should get out of the way. That’s exactly what this bill does.”

""Today, the House delivered on the mandate given to us by 77 million Americans and passed President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill.

This legislation prevents the largest tax hike on Iowa families and small businesses in history by making the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent. It reduces taxes on tips and overtime, doubles the child tax credit, provides a $6,000 tax break for seniors, brings manufacturing jobs back to America, and restores our energy dominance. After four years of crushing inflation and high energy costs under Joe Biden, this bill delivers the relief hardworking Americans deserve.

It also secures the border for good by ending catch-and-release, finishing the fence, and hiring thousands of new agents with the tools to stop crime, fentanyl, and chaos.

This bill strengthens and preserves Medicaid for those it was intended to serve: children, pregnant women, seniors, veterans, and people with disabilities.

It also delivers $50 billion in new relief for rural hospitals serving communities like ours. This is a once-in-a-generation victory for the American people. I was proud to vote for it and look forward to President Trump signing it into law just in time for Independence Day.""

“Thanks to President Trump’s leadership, the historic One Big Beautiful Bill will soon be the law of the land. This transformative legislation enacts tax cuts for working Iowans, permanently secures the border, and strengthens Medicaid for vulnerable populations while rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse. When the Left had power under Biden, they worked to track your Venmo transactions and hired an army of IRS agents; Republicans under President Trump are ending taxes on tips and hiring border patrol agents. Nearly 80 million Americans voted for this commonsense, conservative agenda, and I’m proud to work with President Trump to deliver a stronger, safer, and more prosperous America and Iowa.”

""“The bill we’re sending to the President’s desk locks in the largest middle-class tax cut in American history. It rewards hard work, fuels growth on Main Street, and puts more money back in the pockets of Iowa families. It protects benefits for our most vulnerable by cutting out waste and fraud, strengthens our national defense by investing in border security, and positions Iowa farmers and producers to lead the charge in delivering affordable, American-made energy.”

“President Trump’s ‘One, Big, Beautiful Bill’ is the largest tax cut for Iowa families, farmers, workers, seniors, and small businesses in American history. This legislation will dramatically grow our economy, cut deficits, spur U.S. manufacturing, fully fund the border wall, and support American energy independence. It will also help our Main Street businesses invest in their operations and hire new employees while delivering additional death tax relief for farmers, ensuring that Iowa farmland can be passed to the next generation – not China. President Trump’s ‘One, Big, Beautiful Bill’ will unleash economic growth and rural prosperity in Iowa and nationwide.”

Here's what Ernst said after voting for the bill on Tuesday.

""President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill delivers on what Iowans voted for in November, keeping more money in hardworking folks’ pockets, real border security, and a safer America,"" Ernst said in the statement. ""In addition to the largest tax cut in history for our families, farmers and small businesses, the bill strengthens the integrity of Medicaid and prioritizes those who truly need help by eliminating waste, fraud and abuse. I am proud to have fought to save $100 million for taxpayers over the next decade and eliminated unfair practices in the FAFSA process that held back farm families from investing in their child’s education. I will always fight to improve Iowans' lives and continue to lead the charge in Washington to reduce reckless spending and put taxpayers first.""

Grassley released the following statement after voting for the bill earlier this week.

“In November, Americans gave President Trump a mandate to fix the economy and secure the border. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act delivers a resounding victory for the American people, enacting the America First policies that President Trump and congressional Republicans promised. Together, we’re preventing the largest tax increase in the history of our country and giving relief to the small businesses that are the backbone of our economy. As a lifelong family farmer, I’m proud our bill will also deliver a modernized farm safety net that gives Iowa farmers the certainty they need.

“As Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I oversaw the bill’s measures to make monumental investments in our immigration system, border security and law enforcement. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act will provide safety and prosperity for American families for generations, and I urge my colleagues in the House to quickly get this bill to the President’s desk.""

“Mariannette Miller-Meeks, Zach Nunn, Randy Feenstra and Ashley Hinson — you said yourselves this bill cuts Medicaid. You were told by rural hospital leaders they will have to close. You were told by workers it’s a job killer. You were told by doctors and nurses it will raise costs and by families it will increase their electricity bills. You didn’t listen. You gave away tax breaks to your wealthy donors and racked up more debt for our kids. You went back on your promises. You betrayed your constituents. Now, you deserve to lose your job.”

“While Congressional Republicans pat themselves on the back for engineering yet another giveaway to the exceedingly wealthy, Iowans are bracing for the harsh consequences of this economically devastating bill.

Iowa’s rural hospitals and nursing homes, many already teetering on the brink, may be forced to close their doors for good. Additionally, estimates show that more than 113,000 Iowans would lose access to the health insurance on which they rely, thanks to this disastrous legislation.

As if the cost of living wasn’t high enough already, this bill will cut access to food assistance, increase household energy costs, and make it harder for Iowans to afford college.",https://media.tegna-media.com/assets/WOI/images/ecdd43f5-27ea-41b8-9671-559b3256aef2/20250328T205102/ecdd43f5-27ea-41b8-9671-559b3256aef2_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-07-04 12:23:13.254382

The Senate has approved a sweeping energy bill, shifting tax benefits toward fossil fuel industries while scaling back support for renewables and energy efficiency.

The legislation boosts tax breaks for oil, gas, coal, and carbon capture, while phasing out or limiting clean energy credits.

The American Petroleum Institute celebrated the move. “This historic legislation will help usher in a new era of energy dominance by unlocking opportunities for investment, opening lease sales and expanding access to oil and natural gas development,” said President Mike Sommers.

The bill expands the 45Q carbon capture tax credit, offering $85 per ton for both enhanced oil recovery and geologic storage, and extends it for projects started before 2033.

Other tax benefits help cover drilling expenses and support coal production, particularly for metallurgical coal used in steelmaking.

Clean energy advocates say the revised bill undercuts climate goals. While the wind and solar excise tax was removed and credit phase-outs delayed, developers still face hurdles. Projects must begin construction by mid-2026 or connect to the grid by 2027.

Further pressure comes from new rules restricting foreign components, especially those from China. This affects solar panels, grid batteries, and clean manufacturing projects, potentially raising costs and delaying development.

Energy storage credits were extended, but China-based restrictions may affect viability. These rules create risks for projects that pair storage with solar energy, according to experts.

Energy efficiency projects also took a hit. The bill removes homeowner and builder tax credits for insulation and HVAC upgrades, raising concerns about increased utility bills and stress on the electric grid.

Hydrogen energy received partial support. The 45V tax credit for clean hydrogen is extended to 2028, but shorter than current law. While it may help “blue hydrogen” made from fossil fuels, green hydrogen faces cost challenges due to higher renewable energy costs.

The bill’s outcome now depends on House approval, where political divides may alter its final form.

North Carolina caps its taxes on hospitals and healthcare providers at 6%, while the federal package drops that to 3.5%.","With a final vote in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday, a sweeping tax bill that will touch almost every sector of the economy and overhaul industries like energy and health is headed to President Donald Trump's desk for a signature.

In North Carolina, Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, has publicly rallied against what Republicans have dubbed the ""One Big Beautiful Bill.""

Stein warned that it could threaten the healthcare of as many as 1.2 million North Carolinians; cause 1.4 million people in the state to lose food assistance unless the state can find $420 million to support the program; and cost 45,000 jobs by stymying the state's burgeoning clean tech manufacturing sector.

""The bill is a disgrace, and I am disappointed in those who did not stand up for the people they serve, choosing instead to ignore warnings from local leaders and groups across the state who have sounded the alarm about the dangers in this bill. We cannot simply accept these harmful impacts,"" Stein wrote in a statement after its passage.

Stein also called upon the Republican-controlled N.C. General Assembly to protect the state's Medicaid expansion,which ensures about 670,000 people. The program's future is imperiled by a state provision that effectively removes North Carolina it if the federal government stops covering 90% of the matching cost for the expansion population.

Additionally, Stein wants the General Assembly to provide about $420 million in funding that he says would now be necessary to keep North Carolina enrolled in the federal Supplement Nutrition Assistance Program.

""This will require taking a hard look at our laws, our state budget, and our long-term revenue requirements,"" Stein wrote.

Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., pointed to the Medicaid provision as a key reason for his opposition to the bill shortly before voting against it and announcing he would not seek reelection. Sen. Ted Budd, R-N.C., voted for the bill.

In a letter to the state's Congressional Delegation this week, Stein wrote that in addition to the Medicaid expansion population, as many as 520,000 additional North Carolinians could lose health insurance. Those people's coverage is threatened by changes to Medicaid, Marketplace health plans and subsidies, Stein wrote.

N.C. Department of Health and Human Services officials said Thursday they are reviewing the bill's final language to determine its full impact but warned the changes to Medicaid and food assistance will likely cost the state billions of dollars.

""These cuts not only impact the people that rely on them directly but also strain the systems and communities that hold us all together,"" DHHS Secretary Dev Sangvai said in a statement.

Congressional response

All 10 Republican members of the state's delegation in the U.S. House of Representatives voted for the bill, while all four Democrats voted against it.

Republicans touted passage of the bill, including U.S. Rep. Greg Murphy (R-N.C. 3), a practicing urologist who was known to be concerned about the Medicaid provisions in the package and how they would impact rural healthcare.

In a statement, the eastern North Carolina Republican touted tax cuts and additional spending on border security. He also referenced ""innumerable dynamic and spirited conversations"" with Trump Administration officials about rural health.

""This bill protects Medicaid benefits for those who are most vulnerable in our society, not able-bodied individuals capable of participating in the workforce, illegal immigrants, and those ineligible for benefits,"" Murphy wrote in a statement.

He also pointed to $50 billion to stabilize rural hospital systems as a key part of the package.

U.S, Rep. Mark Harris (R-N.C. 8) represents a district stretching from eastern Mecklenburg County to Robeson County. In a statement, Harris wrote that he is proud to uphold President Donald Trump's agenda, including completing the border wall and taking federal funding away from Planned Parenthood.

Harris also expressed concern, though, about the amount of new spending in the bill, which the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects will add more than $4 trillion to the United States' deficit.

""I recognize to undo the damage done to our country by radical progressive Democrats, Congress must authorize the funds to accomplish that goal. However, I fear that if Washington’s overspending addiction continues, the opportunity to put our country back on a path to a sound financial future is in jeopardy. In the coming months, Republicans must use every tool at our disposal to rein in government spending,"" Harris wrote.

U.S. Rep. Don Davis (D-N.C. 1), who represents an Eastern North Carolina district that is seen as the only competitive Congressional race in the state, expressed disappointment in the bill's passage Thursday afternoon.

""While I wholeheartedly support safeguarding the American people by strengthening our national defense and securing our border, it is also deeply concerning that the average hardworking family in eastern North Carolina will bear the brunt of H.R. 1’s out-of-touch spending, as the wealthiest individuals and Washington, D.C. insiders stand to benefit the most,"" Davis wrote in a statement.

Reaction from potential Senate candidates

U.S. Rep. Pat Harrigan (R-N.C. 10) celebrated defense spending and provisions making permanent the first Trump Administration's tax cuts. The bill keeps more than 500,000 taxpayers in the district from seeing a 27% tax hike, according to statistics Harrigan provided.

""It cuts taxes for working families, slashes wasteful spending, unleashes American energy and gives President Trump the resources to finish the job at the border. The One Big Beautiful Bill puts hardworking Americans first and allows North Carolina families to keep more of their hard-earned money,"" Harrigan wrote in a statement.

Since Tillis announced last weekend that he would not seek re-election, Harrigan has been touted as a potential candidate for the seat.

Another politician who has been considering running for the Senate seat is former Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat with decades of political experience in the state. In a statement posted to X, Cooper called the bill ""shameful.""

""Every day people are struggling to make ends meet with higher prices for food, rent and other bills. The bill just passed in DC not only doesn’t help them, it actually hurts working families, seniors, children and veterans so those at the top can have big tax breaks,"" Cooper wrote.

Wiley Nickel, a Democrat who served one term in Congress and is the only Democrat to have announced a Senate campaign, also slammed the bill and politicians who voted for it.

""Republicans in Congress have yet again caved to pressure from Trump, and in doing so, betrayed their promises to the American people. This bill is a Big Ugly Scam, and is nothing but a tax handout for billionaires that will balloon the deficit and rip health care away from millions,"" Nickel wrote.

Advocacy group reactions

The Food Bank of Central and Eastern North Carolina said it is ""outraged"" by the bill's passage.

Amy Berrios, the Food Bank's president and CEO, pointed to SNAP cuts but also to people who could lose Medicaid under the package. Those people, Berrios wrote, will now need to decide whether to pay for food, housing or medicine.

""We condemn this vote in the strongest possible terms. Our leaders should be finding ways to reduce hunger and put people on the path to self-sufficiency — not enacting cruel policies that push more local farms, businesses, and neighbors into desperation,"" Berrios said in a statement.

The N.C. Healthcare Association, which represents hospital systems across the state, released a statement before Thursday's vote saying that the $50 billion nationwide rural healthcare plan was an inadequate replacement for money that would be lost by capping taxes on healthcare providers and cutting Medicare's payment rates.

North Carolina caps its taxes on hospitals and healthcare providers at 6%, while the federal package drops that to 3.5%. The state uses money from those taxes to help meet federally mandated matches to receive Medicaid funding from the federal government that is sent on to hospitals. The hospitals use that money to help make up for the costs of providing service to the Medicaid population at lower rates.

Capping the tax would effectively wipe out that funding stream for hospitals, the Healthcare Association has warned. That could have significant consequences for safety net hospitals in rural communities.

After Thursday's vote, the Healthcare Association put out another statement saying, ""Now that H.R. 1 has passed, the North Carolina Healthcare Association will work closely with state lawmakers to find solutions that preserve access to care for North Carolinians and continue to engage with our members of Congress to ensure they understand the impact these cuts will have on our state’s Medicaid program.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b8f55dd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1011x531+6+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff8%2F6e%2Fa1b3b1c24283b11165bcd3898284%2F1024px-united-states-capitol-west-front.jpg,N,,2025-07-04 13:21:02.963520

New tax breaks are introduced for seniors, tipped income, overtime pay, and new vehicle loan interest.

It's taken a few months but on July 3rd, President Donald Trump got the centerpiece of his legislative agenda, what he calls his ""big, beautiful bill"" passed — narrowly — by a Republican-led Congress.

Trump, possibly on Independence Day, will sign the bill, which was built around continuing the tax cuts he got Congress to pass eight years ago during his first term beyond their expiration date. But this package goes much further by restricting Medicaid and food stamps, shifting federal costs to states, cutting a slew of other taxes and raising the nation's debt limit by $5 trillion.

Republicans leaders have argued throughout that it delivers on the nation's priorities, cuts spending and will result in lower deficits, despite Democratic claims to the contrary that it hurts working class and lower-income Americans. In the end, pretty much all the more moderate Republicans in the U.S. House, who were said to have concerns over the Medicaid cuts, and more fiscally demanding GOP members, who said it didn't slash government enough, rallied behind it (though it's unclear what, if any promises, were made to them to secure their support). It passed 218-214 on a largely party line final vote. All of Michigan's Republican members voted for it; all the Democrats voted against.

For Michiganders, here's a handful of highlights, or lowlights, depending on your political perspective:

Medicaid beneficiaries and food stamp recipients will see greater restrictions

As has been reported widely, the legislation includes expanded work, education or training requirements of 80 hours a month for able adults who aren't caregivers of small kids to continue getting food stamps under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) or insurance coverage under Medicaid, the state/federal program for low-income individuals and families. (Medicaid work requirements would need to be in place by the end of next year in most cases; it's unclear in the bill when the tougher new SNAP rules would go into place but it could be sooner.) Trump has insisted this doesn't constitute a cut and Republicans have argued that it means people who most need help will get it. But nonprofit providers and Democrats say the end result will be to restrict coverage as people fall off the rolls. The Citizens Research Council of Michigan, a nonpartisan group, estimates between 200,000 and 700,000 Michiganders could lose health insurance under the bill. Meanwhile, additional costs for maintaining the programs will be shifted back onto the state (and its taxpayers) or have to be cut.

No more subsidies for buying an electric vehicle

During former President Joe Biden's administration, a Democratic Congress provided a consumer credit of up to $7,500 for the purchase of a qualifying electric vehicle, or EV, as a way to push product for American automakers who were lining up new models for the coming years. Trump campaigned against it and any other rules trying to push people to buy EVs and the subsidy will terminate, abruptly, on Sept. 30 of this year. Meanwhile, the bill cuts the civil fine for automakers that violate fuel mile-per-gallon standards (which have been used to try to make auto fleets more environmentally friendly) down to zero.

There are some brand new tax breaks for people

In large measure, the bill is intended to make permanent those earlier tax cuts — for corporations and for individual taxpayers — while raising the standard deduction and the child tax credit somewhat. While those changes may not be felt widely as they largely lock in existing breaks, the same can't be said for some others. Like a new $6,000 deduction for some seniors. A deduction for tipped income and overtime pay. And a deduction for interest paid on new vehicle loans (or at least those assembled in the U.S.) Each has its restrictions based on income and how much is being deducted and will last for only a few years as written but they'll make a big difference to some taxpayers.

What does it do for the nation's taxing and spending overall?

When taking into account all of the tax cuts in the legislation, which runs about 900 pages long, revenues — tax collections — would be reduced by about $4.5 trillion over a decade, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO). But the enumerated spending cuts − the specific reductions made to federal government spending − included in the bill total just $1.2 trillion, according to CBO. Various other organizations have made different estimates, and, yes, much of the smaller tax collections result from continuing the earlier 2017 tax cuts beyond their expiration date. But there is widespread agreement among fiscally minded research groups like the Cato Institute and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget that by not making more specific spending cuts and holding back on the tax cut changes it will explode the nation's debt at a time when it should be reining it in. Republicans, however, promise there are more spending cuts on the way.

Does it affect Social Security and Medicare?

Not in any major way directly but there are widespread concerns that it will hasten the already-short window before Social Security's retirement trust fund and Medicare's hospital trust fund become insolvent — meaning reserves and other backups won't be adequate to make up the gap between payroll taxes and the benefits they pay out. (The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says that's just seven years away, which is just a year earlier than trustees for both programs said insolvency would occur.) At that point, benefits will have to be cut, possibly substantially. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says this bill makes the situation worse because by cutting taxes, especially by adding the extra $6,000 cut for taxpayers over age 65, it cuts the amount going into the trust funds.

What's the political fallout?

We'll have to wait to find out. Certainly, everyone understood there was a lot on the line — House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York broke the record for a House speech by speaking for 8 hours, 45 minutes ahead of the vote. (There's no filibuster in the House but each party's top leader can speak for as long as he or she likes as a debate wraps up.) For Republicans, it boosts some of their supporters' biggest priorities — such as increasing spending on military defense, shipbuilding, terminating environmental programs and battling illegal immigration — but if a health care crisis ensues because of Medicaid changes, or rural hospitals suffer, it could result in a huge blowback. And there's no question that GOP members who complained in the past about rising deficits will be accused of having their fingerprints all over them now. That could be a concern in Michigan for GOP members of Congress, including U.S. Rep. John James of Shelby Township, who is running for governor, and U.S. Rep. Tom Barrett, of Charlotte, running for reelection in a closely fought swing district. On the other hand, Democrats like U.S. Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet of Bay City, who is in a swing district herself, could get tagged by Republicans for not backing a bill they say is meant to cut taxes and spending. It remains to be seen just how much the public will pay attention and which side, if either, pays a price. But if one side or the other does, it could be a big price to pay in next year's midterm elections, given that the GOP has a slim 220-212 vote majority.

The US, already the biggest global exporter of the fuel, is on track to nearly double its current capacity with a massive buildout of six projects under construction in Texas and Louisiana. And even more are in advanced stages of development as President Donald Trump has made moves to increase the flow of cargoes from the US.

But most of the existing plants and those in the works are heavily concentrated along the coast of Texas and Louisiana, which means that every new project will bring increased competition on waterways to keep shipments moving. The problem highlights broader issues for US infrastructure that can limit the flow of energy supplies even when there’s plenty of potential production.

Venture Global’s plant Calcasieu Pass, which sits on the east bank of the waterway of the same name, would be directly across from Commonwealth LNG on the west bank. Another rival, Cameron LNG, also operates just north of Venture Global. Two other planned projects, Woodside’s Louisiana LNG and Energy Transfer’s Lake Charles LNG are planned at north end of the waterway.

In a letter sent to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission this week, Venture Global urged the regulator to scrutinize Commonwealth’s proposed waterway plan, known as a waterway suitability assessment, along with a letter it submitted in 2019 by the US Coast Guard, which gave a nod to the plan. Through its attorneys, Venture Global questioned what would happen when the channel would need to be closed to shipping traffic as vessels travel to and from Commonwealth LNG. Venture Global also raised issue over the potential for increased dredging and Commonwealth’s plans to create a turning basin, an area large enough for massive tankers to change directions.

Venture Global’s next project, CP2, is adjacent to Calcasieu Pass and was recently authorized by regulators. The full final investment is pending.

The commission “should ensure that the construction and planned operations of Commonwealth do not adversely impact existing LNG export terminals like Calcasieu Pass or other facilities utilizing the same or overlapping waterways,” the Venture Global letter said.

When asked for comment, Venture Global referred to the letter and declined to give further details.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act has passed in the US House by a vote of 218 to 214.

The bill garnered much bipartisan support after discussion began in early spring 2025. Yet in the end, the only Republican congressional members who voted against it were Pennsylvania’s Brian Fitzpatrick and Kentucky’s Thomas Massie. In the end, the bill passed is what narrowly passed the Senate 51-50.

The One Big Beautiful Bill act makes sweeping changes to US clean energy industrial policy, including repealing the investment tax credit and production tax credit for solar and wind projects several years ahead of schedule.

The three Republican who voted against the Senate bill were Susan Collins of Maine, Thorn Tillis of North Carolina, and Rand Paul of Kentucky, yet they were not the only ones who demonstrated bipartisan support for clean energy until the final vote.

Three Republican Senators, Jodi Ernst (Iowa), Chuck Grassley (Iowa) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) proposed an amendment to change the language before it won Senate approval, which never went to the floor for a vote. However, these three ended up voting for the bill with no changes.

Earlier in the month, 13 members of US Congress urged Senators to take a closer look at several provisions within the bill that they acknowledge will stall investment in and development of clean energy projects. The letter stated that the Senate has a “critical opportunity to restore common sense and deliver a truly pro-energy growth final bill that protects taxpayers while also unleashing the potential of U.S. energy producers, manufacturers, and workers.”

The letter was signed by:

Jen A. Kiggans

Brian K. Fitzpatrick

Gabe Evans

A full and final financial score for the Senate bill is not yet out as the several provisions remain up in the air.
Clean energy industry manufacturers and small businesses had hoped Senate Republicans would ease up rollbacks in the House version.
The Senate bill would also increase a state’s share of administrative costs for the program to 75%, up from the previous 50% cost-sharing responsibility with the federal government.
The Senate bill also raises the country’s debt limit by $5 trillion, a full $1 trillion more than the House version.","WASHINGTON — U.S. House Republicans cleared the “big, beautiful bill” for President Donald Trump’s signature Thursday, marking an end to the painstaking months-long negotiations that began just after voters gave the GOP unified control of Washington during last year’s elections.

The final 218-214 vote on the expansive tax and spending cuts package marked a significant victory for Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., who were able to unify centrist and far-right members of the party against long odds and narrow majorities.

But the legislation’s real-world impacts include millions of Americans expected to lose access to Medicaid through new requirements and slashed spending, and state governments taking on a share of costs for a key nutrition program for low-income families. If voters oppose Republicans at the ballot box in return, it could mean the GOP loses the House during next year’s midterm elections.

In the end just two Republicans in the House and three in the Senate opposed the measure, which the Senate approved earlier in the week with Vice President JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote.

Trump posted on social media numerous times in the days leading up to the vote, thanking supportive Republicans who were praising the bill during interviews and threatening to back primary challenges against GOP lawmakers who stood in the way of passage.

“Largest Tax Cuts in History and a Booming Economy vs. Biggest Tax Increase in History, and a Failed Economy,” Trump posted just after midnight when it wasn’t yet clear the bill would pass. “What are the Republicans waiting for??? What are you trying to prove??? MAGA IS NOT HAPPY, AND IT’S COSTING YOU VOTES!!!”

Trump told reporters while on his way to Iowa for an event that he would sign the bill at 5 p.m. Eastern on Friday, with military aircraft flying over the White House and Republican lawmakers in attendance.

Johnson said during a floor speech the legislation is a direct result of the November elections, when voters gave the GOP control of the House, Senate and the White House.

“That election was decisive. It was a bellwether. It was a time for choosing,” Johnson said. “And I tell you what — the American people chose, overwhelmingly, they chose the Republican Party.”

The package, he said, would make the country “stronger, safer and more prosperous than ever before.”

“We’ve had spirited debates, we’ve had months of deliberation and now we are finally ready to fulfill our promise to the American people,” Johnson said.

Republicans were spurred to write the tax provisions in the legislation to avoid a cliff at the end of the year, created by the party’s 2017 tax law. But the legislation holds dozens of other provisions as well, spanning border security, defense, energy production, health care and higher education aid.

The bill raises the country’s debt limit by $5 trillion, a staggering figure that many fiscal hawks would have once balked at, but is enough to get Republicans past the midterm elections before they’ll have to negotiate another deal to raise the country’s borrowing limit.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office’s latest analysis of the measure projects it would add $3.4 trillion to deficits during the next decade compared to current law.

Jeffries: “It guts Medicaid’

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., called the health care provisions “reckless” during a speech that lasted nearly nine hours, forcing the vote to take place in the afternoon rather than early morning, and said the “bill represents the largest cut to health care in American history.”

“Almost $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid,” Jeffries said. “This runs directly contrary to what President Trump indicated in January, which was that he was going to love and cherish Medicaid. Nothing about this bill loves and cherishes Medicaid. It guts Medicaid.”

The speech broke the eight-hour-and-32-minute record that then-Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., set in 2021 when he sought to delay Democrats from passing a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package. House leaders are allowed to exceed normal speaking limits through a privilege called the “magic minute.”

The nonpartisan health research organization KFF’s analysis of the package shows it would reduce federal spending on Medicaid by nearly $1 trillion during the next decade and lead to 11.8 million people becoming uninsured.

Republicans made numerous changes to the state-federal health program for lower income people and some people with disabilities, including a requirement that some enrollees work, participate in community service, or attend an educational program for at least 80 hours a month.

Medicaid patients will no longer be able to have their care covered at Planned Parenthood for routine appointments, like annual physicals and cancer screenings, for one year. Congress has barred federal taxpayer dollars from going to abortions with limited exceptions for decades, but the new provision will block all Medicaid funding from going to Planned Parenthood, likely leading some of its clinics to close.

Overnight drama

House passage followed several frenzied days on Capitol Hill as congressional leaders and Trump sought to sway holdouts to their side ahead of a self-imposed Fourth of July deadline.

The Senate, and then later the House, held overnight sessions followed by dramatic votes where several Republicans, who said publicly they didn’t actually like the bill, voted to approve it anyway.

GOP leaders didn’t have much room for error amid a narrow 53-seat Senate majority and a 220-212 advantage in the House. That delicate balance hovered in the background during the last several months, as talks over dozens of policy changes and spending cuts in the bill appeared deadlocked.

Any modifications meant to bring on board far-right members of the party had to be weighed against the policy goals of centrist lawmakers, who are most at risk of losing their seats during next year’s elections.

The House passed its first version of the bill following a 215-214 vote in May, sending the legislation to the Senate, where Republicans in that chamber spent several weeks deciding which policies they could support and which they wanted to remove or rework.

The measure changed substantially to comply with the complex rules for moving a budget reconciliation bill through the upper chamber. GOP leaders chose to use that process, instead of moving the package through the regular legislative pathway, to avoid having to negotiate with Democrats to get past the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster.

In the end nearly every one of the 273 Republicans in Congress approved the behemoth 870-page bill.

Maine’s Susan Collins, Kentucky’s Rand Paul and North Carolina’s Thom Tillis voted against it in the Senate and Pennsylvania Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick and Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie opposed passage in the House.

Fitzpatrick wrote in a statement that while he voted to approve the House’s original version of the bill, he couldn’t support changes made in the Senate.

“I voted to strengthen Medicaid protections, to permanently extend middle class tax cuts, for enhanced small business tax relief, and for historic investments in our border security and our military.” Fitzpatrick wrote. “However, it was the Senate’s amendments to Medicaid, in addition to several other Senate provisions, that altered the analysis for our PA-1 community.”

Massie posted on social media that he couldn’t vote for the measure because it would exacerbate the country’s annual deficit.

“Although there were some conservative wins in the budget reconciliation bill (OBBBA), I voted No on final passage because it will significantly increase U.S. budget deficits in the near term, negatively impacting all Americans through sustained inflation and high interest rates,” Massie wrote.

GOP holdouts delay passage

Floor debate on the bill in the House, which began around 3:30 a.m. Eastern Thursday and lasted 11 hours, was along party lines, with Democrats voicing strong opposition to changes in the package and GOP lawmakers arguing it puts the country on a better path.

GOP leaders didn’t originally plan to begin debate in the middle of the night while most of the country slept, but were forced to after holdouts refused to give their votes to a procedural step.

When the House did finally adopt the rule, Pennsylvania’s Brian Fitzpatrick was the sole member of his party to vote against moving onto floor debate and a final passage vote.

Fitzpatrick had posted on social media earlier in the day that he wanted Trump “to address my serious concern regarding reports the United States is withholding critical defense material pledged to Ukraine.”

“Ukrainian forces are not only safeguarding their homeland—they are holding the front line of freedom itself,” he wrote. “There can be no half-measures in the defense of liberty. We must, as we always have, stand for peace through strength.”

Tax breaks and so much more

House Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith, R-Mo., made significant promises to middle-class Americans during floor debate about the tax provisions in the bill that many voters will be watching for in the months ahead.

“Households making under $100,000 will see a 12% tax cut compared to what they pay today. The average family of four will see nearly 11,000 more in their pockets each year,” Smith said. “Real wages for workers will rise by as much as $7,200 a year. A waitress working for tips will keep an extra $1,300, a lineman working overtime after a storm will keep an extra $1,400.”

Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Richard Neal, ranking member on the tax writing panel, said the legislation’s benefits skew largely toward the very wealthy.

“If you made a million dollars last year, you’re going to make a plus of $96,000 in the next tax filing season,” Neal said. “If you made under $50,000 last year, you’re going to get 68 cents a day in terms of your tax relief.”

The extension of the 2017 tax law would predominantly benefit high-income earners. The top 1% would receive a tax cut three times the size of those with incomes in the bottom 60% of after-tax income, according to analysis from the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

Some other tax incentives that critics say skew toward wealthier families include a $1,000 deposit from the federal government for babies born between 2024 and 2028, known as a “Trump account.” The program would track a stock index and gain interest accordingly and families with disposable income could contribute additional funding.

And while Republicans included an extension of the child tax credit to $2,200 per child, it requires the parents to have a Social Security number to claim the tax credit.

The bill will give the president more than $170 billion to carry out his campaign promise of mass deportations of people in the country without permanent legal status. The package would give the Department of Homeland Security $45 billion for the detention of immigrants and give its immigration enforcement arm another $30 billion to hire up to 10,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

Food aid, higher education

The legislation will overhaul federal loans for higher education and how states pay for food assistance that roughly 42 million low-income people rely on, known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.

The bill would cap federal graduate loans to $100,000 per borrower and $200,000 per borrower who is attending law school or medical school. It would also cap the ParentPLUS loans to $65,000.

Under the SNAP changes, the package would require states to shoulder more of the burden in food assistance. Currently, the federal government covers 100% of the cost. The legislation tightens eligibility for SNAP, requiring parents with children aged 6 and older to meet the work requirements when they were previously exempt.

The SNAP changes would reduce federal spending on the program by $230 billion over 10 years.

The GOP megabill cuts clean energy tax credits and claws back some of the funding in former president Joe Biden’s signature climate bill, known as the Inflation Reduction Act.

Some of those cuts to clean energy tax credits include terminating at the end of September a nearly $8,000 rebate for the purchase of an electric vehicle, ending a tax credit by December for energy efficient home upgrades such as solar roof panels and heat pumps.

The package rescinds funds to help local governments and states adopt zero emission standards, and eliminates environmental justice block grants that communities used to address health impacts due to environmental pollution, among other things.

About 35 million years ago, Hampton Roads was underwater, with the coastline dozens of miles west toward Richmond.

Dinosaurs were long gone, but the ocean teemed with marine creatures such as ancient whales, sharks and sea stars.

That is until one unfortunate day, when life across what’s now southeastern Virginia was obliterated within seconds.

A bolide – an extraterrestrial object such as an asteroid or comet – hurtled out of space and landed in the lower part of the Chesapeake Bay.

“There was a kill zone that would have been several hundred miles out in every direction,” said Rich Whittecar, a geologist and emeritus professor at Old Dominion University.

The volcanic-like lateral blast from the impact ripped through faster than the speed of sound, with exponentially more explosive power than atomic bombs detonated by humans, Whittecar said.

Plants and animals would be “totally shredded” by all the material – and simultaneously incinerated by the intense heat.

“Not a good day,” Whittecar said.

Geologists first pieced together the story of the Chesapeake Bay impact crater in the 1990s. It’s the largest known bolide strike in the U.S. and among the largest in the world.

But new research is the first to document the far-reaching impacts of the collision. Scientists say they uncovered a site 240 miles away in the Sandhills of North Carolina showing traces of a massive tsunami caused by the Virginia asteroid.

And the discovery all started by chance.

A mystery buried underground

Almost a decade ago, retired consulting geologist Bob Ganis was investigating some fossils in Moore County, N.C. when he got a call from a local property owner nearby.

A pipeline was set to be constructed through the edge of her property called Paint Hill Farm, and she wondered if Ganis might like to come investigate the temporary trench as part of his research.

Ganis accepted the offer and it became “one of the most strange days of my life,” he said.

He took a look at the rock layers exposed about 10 feet deep and was “totally baffled.” What he saw didn’t align with his geological understanding of the region.

“I had no idea what it was, and no reports of this kind of geology were available to understand what it was,” he said.

Thus began a yearslong quest to get to the bottom of the mystery trapped in sediment. The first piece of the puzzle was determining the age of the rock layers in question.

Ganis said he found fossilized shark teeth nearby and worked with peers who helped date them to the late Eocene era, which lasted from about 56 to 34 million years ago.

Next Ganis connected with Ralph Willoughby with the South Carolina Geological Survey, and described the mysterious sediment layers. They methodically went through the rock beds to try and explain each within the geological context of the region.

“When we get to the top, this explanation of all this rubble at the top, we’re still scratching our heads,” Ganis said. “‘What is this stuff?’”

One day, looking at photos from the trench site, “a light bulb goes off,” he said. “It struck us (that) this is a tsunami deposit.”

There was no geological history to explain why such a deposit would be there, except for one: the meteoroid strike up in Virginia on that fateful day 35 million years ago.

Solving the mystery

The asteroid, moving at about 44,000 miles per hour, was about 2 to 3 miles wide and blasted an enormous crater into the continental shelf of modern day Virginia, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

Much of the crater is still underwater in the bay, which is why it took until recent decades for scientists to discover. The circular outline of the impact in Hampton Roads includes the bottom half of the Eastern Shore, northern edge of Norfolk and eastern outskirts of the Peninsula and Middle Peninsula.

Like any object that lands in water, the asteroid caused a big splash – a giant tsunami likely thousands of feet high, “the kind of tsunami that the world rarely sees,” Ganis said.

It likely washed over the Blue Ridge Mountains and swept across the Southeast – maybe even over the Atlantic Ocean to lap at the shores of Africa and Europe, he said.

Scientists described such a wide-reaching tsunami when they first investigated the Chesapeake Bay impact crater but no one had found actual remains of it.

Ganis’ team homed in on the tsunami as a likely explanation for the Paint Hill rock formation, but needed more evidence to prove it.

The bottom layer featured charcoal, natural glass and other rock fragments; materials you would expect to fly out of the impact, Ganis said. It also had the hallmarks of a “tremendously hot blast.” Another layer contained ash from the explosion.

Whittecar, the ODU geologist, came in to help figure out the top layer, a sandy conglomeration including petrified wood and what looked like a substance called plinthite. The team needed an expert to confirm.

“I went down (to) look at this stuff and basically said, ‘Yep, that’s plinthite,’” Whittecar said.

The material is an iron-rich, clumpy reddish clay common in tropical regions. Researchers believe the Virginia tsunami swept up this material from the seabed and ended up at Paint Hill.

The presence of iridium in the sediment helped nail down the team’s tsunami theory. It is an extremely rare metal on Earth but common in asteroids.

The researchers published their collaborative findings in the peer-reviewed journal Southeastern Geology last month.

Paint Hill’s owner recently sold the 300-acre property to the nonprofit Nature Conservancy, which plans to turn it over to the state park system to expand the Weymouth Woods Sandhills Nature Preserve.

The tsunami deposits will be preserved and may become a “highlight of the park” through related exhibits and educational activities, Ganis said.

Whittecar said geologists are interested in this type of work largely out of curiosity and advancing knowledge for future generations.

“From the practical hazard prevention side of things,” he said, “of course it does give a little weight to the notion that if we can stop one of these (asteroids) from hitting, it is worth getting out there and nudging that thing out of the way.”

State, federal, and local officials who fought for years to bring the new FBI headquarters to Prince George’s County said Tuesday the fight is not over after the surprise Trump administration announcement that the agency will stay downtown.

The FBI will move into existing space at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center, just a few blocks down Pennsylvania Avenue from the current dilapidated headquarters in the aging J. Edgar Hoover Building, according to a statement from the FBI and the General Services Administration.

“Moving to the Ronald Reagan Building is the most cost-effective and resource-efficient way to carry out our mission to protect the American people and uphold the Constitution,” FBI Director Kash Patel said in the statement.

The move reverses a 2023 GSA decision that identified a site near the Greenbelt Metro for the new headquarters, following years of study and of competition between Maryland and Virginia jurisdictions to land the site.

Gov. Wes Moore (D), Prince Georges’s County Executive Aisha Braveboy (D), and almost all of the state’s congressional delegation — calling themselves Team Maryland — insisted Tuesday that Greenbelt is still the better site.

“Simply moving down the street would ignore the real threats the Bureau faces and further jeopardize the safety of those protecting our communities. That’s why we will be fighting back against this proposal with every tool we have,” the Team Maryland statement said.

The agency has been seeking new headquarters for years to replace the J. Edgar Hoover Building, a brutalist facility that is cramped and has leaks and pieces of concrete occasionally falling onto the street below.

In November 2023, the GSA picked Greenbelt over another site in Prince George’s County, Landover, and over a site in Springfield, Virginia.

Virginia representatives charged that the selection of Maryland was flawed after a federal inspector general’s report released in February found fault with the process. But the report never stated there was a problem with the Greenbelt site itself.

Whatever reservations they may have had about the Greenbelt site, however, was put aside by Virginia’s senators for criticism of the Reagan Building proposal, which Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine said “isn’t a plan, it’s a punt.” The two Democrats said the choice of a new site was typical of the Trump administration’s haphazard approach to the federal workforce.

“For years, Democratic and Republican administrations alike have agreed on the need for a secure, purpose-built headquarters that actually meets the FBI’s mission needs,” said a joint statement from Kaine and Warner, “This announcement brushes aside years of careful planning, ignores the recommendations of security and mission experts, and raises serious concerns about how this decision was made.”

President Donald Trump has never been a fan of moving the FBI out of the District. He tried to cancel it in his first term and in March of this year, less that two months after returning to office, he said he would not let the agency move “three hours away in Maryland, a liberal state.” He quickly said the state’s political leanings had no bearing on his decision, but never corrected the fact that Greenbelt is about 16 miles by car from the current headquarters.

Patel has talked in recent months about relocating headquarters staff to other parts of the country, but Tuesday’s announcement seems to have put that talk on hold.

GSA Public Buildings Service Commissioner Michael Peters said in a statement that move to the Reagan building avoids more than $300 million in deferred maintenance cost the current FBI headquarters.

“We are proud to partner with Director Patel to drive efficiency and improve the quality of space for a productive workforce in service to national security and taxpayers,” Peters said.

According to its website, the Reagan Building is home to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Until recently, it was also home to the U.S. Agency on International Developement, before that agency was gutted by the Trump administration and closed as an independent agency effective Tuesday, presumably freeing up space in the building.

But the building also has 22 event spaces to host weddings and events. Plans are scheduled for two events Wednesday, and a concert series on a plaza starts Monday and continues through September.

Del. Nicole Williams (D-Prince George’s), whose legislative district includes the Greenbelt site, called Tuesday’s decision “very interesting.”

“That [Ronald Reagan] building is a very open building. I’ve gone there for private events and conferences,” Williams, who chairs the county’s delegation in the House of Delegate, said in an interview.

“I still maintain that the Greenbelt site is the better location for the relocation of the FBI. It’s disappointing to hear the administration trying to undermine what was already done through the official GSA process,” she said.

“Congress has already appropriated funds for the purpose of the construction of the new FBI headquarters in Maryland. Now the administration’s attempting to redirect those funds really undermines congressional intent,” Williams said, echoing arguments of Team Maryland.

Williams and her two Democratic District 22 colleagues – Dels. Anne Healey and Ashanti Martinez – sponsored legislation that went into effect Tuesday directing the governor to include $200 million in the state budget “for site redevelopment and to improve transportation infrastructure for the Federal Bureau of Investigation headquarters relocation project.”

This report has been updated.

WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate voted mostly along party lines late Saturday night to move forward with Republicans’ “big, beautiful bill” that President Donald Trump wants on his desk in less than a week, after a dramatic three-hour pause when several GOP senators withheld their votes.

Republican Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Rand Paul of Kentucky voted against moving forward with the sweeping tax break and spending cuts package that contains many of the GOP’s campaign promises. All Democrats were opposed. Vice President JD Vance came to the Capitol in case a tie-breaking vote was required, but in the end was not needed.

Tillis, who is up for reelection in 2026, had told reporters earlier that he would vote “no” on what is called a motion to proceed and on final passage.

He said in a statement that the legislation would result in tens of billions of dollars in lost funding for North Carolina and force the state to make “painful decisions” about Medicaid. Trump, in a post on social media, later threatened to find primary candidates to challenge Tillis.

The 51-49 vote doesn’t guarantee the bill will make it through a final passage vote, but does make it significantly more likely, even with Republicans’ narrow 53-47 majority.

The procedural vote kicked off a maximum of 20 hours of floor debate on the bill, with half of that time controlled by Democrats and the other half by Republicans, though Democrats after the motion to proceed vote forced a reading of the giant bill expected to take as long as 15 hours. That would mean the floor debate would not begin until sometime Sunday.

Unlike regular bills, budget reconciliation packages are not subject to the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster, so as long as at least 50 Republicans support the package, and Vance casts the tie-breaking vote if needed, the measure will go back to the House.

The vote on the motion to proceed that began at about 7:30 p.m. Eastern was held open for more than three hours, with the votes of four senators in suspense — Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mike Lee of Utah, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming and Rick Scott of Florida. All four eventually voted aye and Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson switched his vote to aye after earlier voting against the measure.

Lee, however, just before the vote was over, announced he had pulled from the bill an extremely controversial proposal to sell some public lands that was opposed by other lawmakers from the West. He said because of the process being used for the bill, he was unable to obtain enforceable safeguards to ensure the land would be sold to American families and not China or foreign interests.

The latest version of the measure had set up the Interior Department to sell at least 600,000 acres of public land and up to 1.2 million acres of public land within 10 years, advocates said.

Critics, including hunters, anglers and other Western state constituents, have ripped the measure as a “land grab,” as put by Jennifer Rokala, executive director for the Center for Western Priorities.

A summary of the provisions by the Energy and Natural Resources Committee said the Bureau of Land Management “must sell a minimum of 0.25% and a maximum of 0.50% of their estate for housing and associated community needs. This will increase the supply of housing and decrease housing costs for millions of American families.”

Golfing with Trump

Senate GOP leaders released new bill text just before midnight Friday that satisfied rural state lawmakers’ worries about financial threats to rural hospitals posed by cuts in Medicaid. The bill also addresses concerns by Murkowski and Dan Sullivan of Alaska about access to food assistance for their constituents despite new restrictions on a USDA program for low-income people.

As talks continued on Capitol Hill Saturday afternoon, a handful of Senate Republicans, including Missouri’s Eric Schmitt and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, were on the golf course with Trump, according to the White House. Graham said on social media that Kentucky’s Paul also played.

Senate Democrats said a fresh financial analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the preliminary Senate text would result in $930 billion in cuts to Medicaid, the joint federal-state low-income health insurance and disability assistance program.

The CBO score was not yet publicly available but Sen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Committee on Finance, pointed to it and slammed the Medicaid provisions as “cruel” in a statement Saturday afternoon.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, also cited the preliminary analysis, pointing to the nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts.

Collins promises amendments

Senate Republicans planned to take their negotiations to the floor and push for amendments after the procedural vote that triggered official debate on the bill, which in its current public version runs 940 pages.

GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who voiced concerns throughout negotiations about rural hospitals and health cuts that would harm low-income individuals, said her vote on the motion to proceed “does not predict my vote on final passage.”

“I will be filing a number of amendments,” she told reporters as she headed into a closed-door working lunch before the Senate convened at 2 p.m. Eastern.

While Sen. Tim Sheehy wrote on social media Saturday afternoon that he was a “no” on the motion to proceed because of a provision to sell off federal public lands, the Montana Republican changed his mind nearly an hour later and declared he would propose an amendment to strip the provision — which was later removed by its sponsor.

GOP Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma painted somewhat of a rosier picture of the mood in the Senate, telling reporters “we’re good.”

“We won’t bring it to the floor if we don’t have the votes,” said Mullin, who was the lead negotiator with House Republicans on state and local tax deductions, or SALT — a sticking point for Republicans who represent high-tax blue states like New York and California.

The lawmakers settled on a $40,000 deduction through 2029 for taxpayers who earn up to $500,000 annually. The level then reverts to $10,000, the current limit under the 2017 tax law.

Medicaid turmoil

Proposed changes to Medicaid have been strongly resisted by rural medical providers who say they are already financially strapped.

Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley told reporters Saturday he would be a “yes” on both the motion to proceed vote and the final bill based on the new rural hospital “transformation program” Senate leadership included in the bill overnight. The measure has yet to be finalized.

The bill’s new version includes $25 billion in a stabilization fund for rural hospitals from 2028 through 2032. The amount is frontloaded to give more of the funds in the first two years.

Critics warn that amount will not fill the financial gaps that rural medical providers will face from losing a sizable portion of federal funding via Medicaid cuts.

While Hawley called the fund a “win” for Missouri over the next several years, he said his party needs to do some “soul searching” over the “unhappy episode” of wrangling over Medicaid cuts.

“If you want to be a working-class party, you’ve got to deliver for working-class people. You cannot take away health care for working people,” he said.

Senators had not yet agreed on other Medicaid provisions as of Saturday afternoon, including a phase-down of the provider tax rate from 6% to a possible 3.5% that’s become hugely controversial.

States use a combination of general revenues, provider tax revenues and in some cases local contributions to fund their Medicaid programs.

Advocates warn that it’s not a guarantee states would be able to backfill the lost revenue, and if they can’t, provider rate cuts and losses of benefits for patients could be on the horizon.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that the House version’s provider tax changes — not as deep as the current Senate proposal — could lead to 400,000 people losing Medicaid benefits.

A full and final financial score for the Senate bill is not yet out as the several provisions remain up in the air.

Hawley also praised the inclusion of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act fund, or RECA, that revives payments for survivors and victims who suffered cancer as a result of U.S. atomic bomb testing and radioactive waste dumps.

Clean energy tax credits

In what clean power advocates dubbed a “midnight dumping,” Senate GOP leadership added language to accelerate the phase out of clean energy tax credits that were enacted under Democrats’ own massive mega-bill in 2022 titled the “Inflation Reduction Act.”

The language, which wasn’t yet finalized by Senate GOP tax writers as of 6 p.m. Eastern Saturday, tightened restrictions on foreign components in wind and solar projects — and added a new tax on those that don’t comply.

Senators largely targeted wind and solar credits, ending them for projects not plugged into the electricity grid by 2028. Additionally credits for wind turbine manufacturers would terminate in 2028.

Other tax credits would be phased out at a faster pace, including those for the production of critical minerals, though a credit for metallurgical coal, used in steelmaking, was added in.

Clean energy industry manufacturers and small businesses had hoped Senate Republicans would ease up rollbacks in the House version.

Kurt Neutgens, president and chief technology officer of Orange EV, told States Newsroom in an interview Friday that any further rollbacks would amount to “cutting our legs out from underneath us.”

Neutgens, whose Kansas City, Kansas-based company manufactures heavy duty electric trucks and chargers, was watching for changes to credits to the commercial clean vehicles credit. New Senate GOP text would terminate the credit in September of this year.

Jason Grumet, president of the Clean Power Association, said in a statement Saturday that imposing new taxes on the industry “will strand hundreds of billions of dollars in current investments, threaten energy security, and undermine growth in domestic manufacturing and land hardest on rural communities who would have been the greatest beneficiaries of clean energy investment.”

Alaska carve-outs

Proposed cuts to federal food assistance remained largely unchanged in the new text released Friday night except for a few carve-outs for Alaska.

If the bill were enacted as written, Alaska’s state government could request a waiver for its citizens from stricter work reporting requirements that critics say will result in some SNAP recipients losing their food benefits.

GOP lawmakers also slightly shifted the timeline for when states will have to begin shouldering SNAP costs — the first time states will be on the hook for the federal food assistance outside of administrative costs.

States would be required to pick up a portion of the costs depending on their “payment error rate” — meaning how accurate states are at determining who needs SNAP, including both overpayments and underpayments.

States that have error rates at 6% or above would responsible for up to 15% of the food program’s cost. According to SNAP error rate data for 2023, the latest available, only seven states had an error rate below 6%.

The new text delays the cost-sharing for states until 2028 and allows states to choose the lesser of their two error rates in either 2025 or 2026.

Starting in 2029, states will be required to use their error rate from three years prior to the current year.

The new text includes the option for Alaska and Hawaii to waive their cost share burden for up to two years if their governments implement an improvement plan. In 2023, Alaska had the highest payment error rate of all states, reaching just above 60%.

Advocates for low-income families worry the cost, which will amount to billions for most state governments, will incentivize states to tighten eligibility requirements for the program, or even drop SNAP altogether.

The left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates the cuts will affect up to 40 million people who receive basic SNAP assistance, including 16 million children and 8 million seniors.

The Senate bill would also increase a state’s share of administrative costs for the program to 75%, up from the previous 50% cost-sharing responsibility with the federal government.

Despite inaccurate public statements from Republicans as recently as in a bill summary released overnight, the bill does nothing to limit food assistance to immigrants without documentation because SNAP was never available to them.

SNAP benefits will remain available to legal permanent residents, and Republicans loosened some language to allow certain immigrants from Cuba or Haiti to access the program.

But if the bill passes, federal food assistance will not be available to refugees and asylees who are already in the U.S. — for example, people from Afghanistan, Ukraine and other war-torn places.

Education revisions

Republicans on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions revised or scrapped several measures that the parliamentarian deemed to not comply with the “Byrd Bath,” a Senate process named for the late Sen. Robert Byrd, according to a summary and new bill text out Friday.

Under the revised text, for any loans made starting July 1, 2026, borrowers will have only two repayment plan options: a standard repayment plan and an income-driven repayment plan. The original proposal would have applied these restrictions to existing borrowers, but the parliamentarian struck that down.

Republicans also nixed a proposal that opened up the Pell Grant — a government subsidy that helps low-income students pay for college — to institutions that are not accredited.

The new plan also scraps a restriction that barred payments made by students enrolled in a medical or dental internship or residency program from counting toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness.

‘Even worse than any draft’

Senate Democrats remain united in opposition to the bill and are expected to slow down final passage by introducing numerous amendments on the floor during what is called the vote-a-rama.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer continued to rally against the package during remarks on the Senate floor Saturday afternoon, saying it’s “hard to believe this bill is worse — even worse — than any draft we’ve seen this far.”

The New York Democrat said “it’s worse on health care, it’s worse on SNAP (the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), it’s worse on the deficit.”

Schumer added that “if Republicans proceed, Senate Democrats will hold them to account.”

“We’ll gear up for another night of vote-a-rama very soon. We’ll expose this bill piece by piece. We will show how it cuts health care, raises costs, rewards the ultra rich.”

The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities condemned the cuts to safety net programs as “all in service to tax cuts that are heavily skewed toward the wealthy and corporations.”

“None of this harm has anything to do with fiscal responsibility: our deficits and debts would soar under this bill,” said Sharon Parrott, the think tank’s president, in a statement Saturday.

The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan watchdog, released a new analysis Saturday finding the Senate version will add roughly $4 trillion to the national deficit over 10 years.

“If you thought the House bill borrowed too much — and it did — the Senate manages to make things even worse,” CRFB’s president Maya MacGuineas said in a statement.

House action

Senate Republicans have spent more than a month rewriting the bills that make up the measure in order to meet the strict rules for moving a budget reconciliation package and to earn support from enough Republicans to actually pass the legislation.

The lawmakers have been struggling to maintain spending cuts passed by House Republicans that will pay for the nearly $4 trillion price tag for extending and expanding the 2017 tax cuts.

The House voted 215-214 to approve its 11-bill version of the package in May. Many of that chamber’s GOP lawmakers hoped the Senate wouldn’t change much, though that hasn’t been the case.

The Senate has modified numerous proposals, including those addressing tax law; Medicaid; and SNAP. The Senate bill also raises the country’s debt limit by $5 trillion, a full $1 trillion more than the House version.

The revisions have led to concerns among both centrist House GOP lawmakers and far-right members of the party, muddying the waters around whether Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., can cobble together the votes needed to clear the package for Trump’s signature.

Republicans hold a 220-212 majority in the House, so leaders there can only lose four members if all of the chamber’s lawmakers are present and voting.

Trump has encouraged Congress to approve the legislation before the Fourth of July, but with time running short and some tempers rising over how the legislation will impact the country’s deficits, that might not be possible.

“The Great Republicans in the U.S. Senate are working all weekend to finish our ‘ONE, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL’,” Trump posted on social media Friday.

“The House of Representatives must be ready to send it to my desk before July 4th — We can get it done,” he added. “It will be a wonderful Celebration for our Country, which is right now, ‘The Hottest Country anywhere in the World’ — And to think, just last year, we were a laughingstock. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”

WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court Friday in a major decision reined in nationwide injunctions by some lower courts that had blocked President Donald Trump’s executive order barring birthright citizenship.

The high court declined to decide the constitutionality of birthright citizenship itself. But the justices said the Trump executive order rewriting the constitutional right to birthright citizenship could go into effect within 30 days after Friday’s ruling in the 28 states that did not initially sue.

The Supreme Court’s 6-3 decision thus raises the prospect that a child born in some states would be regarded legally as a U.S. citizen but not in others until the overall question of constitutionality is settled, unless there is further legal action.

The sweeping ruling also likely could hamper other legal challenges against Trump administration actions in which nationwide injunctions are sought. Democratic attorneys general in the states have been successful in obtaining injunctions in the months since Trump was elected.

“GIANT WIN in the United States Supreme Court!” Trump wrote on social media shortly after the ruling.

Speaking at the White House later, Trump said his administration will move forward with several executive orders that have faced nationwide injunctions, such as suspending refugee resettlement and revoking federal funds from “sanctuary” states and localities.

“Thanks to this decision, we can now promptly file to proceed with these numerous policies and those that have been wrongly enjoined on a nationwide basis, including birthright citizenship,” Trump said.

Liberals on the high court issued a strong dissent. “No right is safe in the new legal regime the Court creates,” wrote Justice Sonia Sotomayor. “Today, the threat is to birthright citizenship. Tomorrow, a different administration may try to seize firearms from law abiding citizens or prevent people of certain faiths from gathering to worship.”

Joining the dissent were Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson.

Barrett writes ruling

In the ruling, the conservative justices found that nationwide “injunctions likely exceed the equitable authority that Congress has given to federal courts.”

“The Court grants the Government’s applications for a partial stay of the injunctions entered below, but only to the extent that the injunctions are broader than necessary to provide complete relief to each plaintiff with standing to sue,” according to the ruling, written by Justice Amy Coney Barrett and joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Brett Kavanaugh, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch.

While the dispute before the court related to Trump’s executive order to rewrite the constitutional right to birthright citizenship, the Trump administration asked the high court to instead focus on the issue of preliminary injunctions granted by lower courts.

“The applications do not raise—and thus the Court does not address—the question whether the Executive Order violates the Citizenship Clause or Nationality Act,” according to the ruling, referring to the practice of granting citizenship to babies born on U.S. soil.

Attorney General Pam Bondi, who appeared at the White House with the president, predicted the Supreme Court in its new term in October will take up the merits of the executive order that aims to redefine birthright citizenship.

The high court’s ruling instructs lower courts to “move expeditiously to ensure that, with respect to each plaintiff, the injunctions comport with this rule and otherwise comply with principles of equity.”

In the first 100 days of the second Trump administration, through April 29, judges issued about 25 nationwide injunctions, according to the Congressional Research Service.

“The lower courts should determine whether a narrower injunction is appropriate; we therefore leave it to them to consider these and any related arguments,” according to the ruling.

A narrower injunction could refer to a class action suit.

Barrett argued that a nationwide injunction would not grant more relief for barring the enforcement of Trump’s executive order against a pregnant person who is not a U.S. citizen and fears their child would be denied citizenship.

“Her child will not be denied citizenship. And extending the injunction to cover everyone similarly situated would not render her relief any more complete,” according to the ruling. “So the individual and associational respondents are wrong to characterize the universal injunction as simply an application of the complete-relief principle.”

Stateless people

Trump ran on a reelection campaign platform promising mass deportations of people without permanent legal status and vowed to end the constitutional right of birthright citizenship.

During the press conference at the White House Trump said that birthright citizenship historically was only meant to benefit the children of the newly freed African Americans, not the children of immigrants.

“It wasn’t meant for people trying to scam the system and come into the country on vacation,” Trump said.

Under birthright citizenship, all children born in the United States are considered citizens, regardless of their parents’ legal status.

If birthright citizenship were to be eliminated, more than 250,000 children born each year would not be granted U.S. citizenship, according to a recent study by the think tank the Migration Policy Institute.

It would effectively create a class of 2.7 million stateless people by 2045, according to the study.

In last month’s oral arguments, Solicitor General D. John Sauer, who argued on behalf of the Trump administration, contended that it’s unconstitutional for federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions. Instead, he said, the injunctions should be limited to those who brought the challenges.

‘Consequences for the children’

New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin said during a briefing with reporters that one group of private individuals that challenged the executive order has already filed a class action suit.

“I suspect more will come,” Platkin said.

Washington state Attorney General Nick Brown said at the press conference of Democratic attorneys general that because of Friday’s ruling, the rights of future newborns who hail from states that have not directly challenged the order will be in question.

“In Washington and New Jersey and Massachusetts, Connecticut, your rights are much more strong, but in all those other states, including many of our neighbor states, not participating in this case is going to have consequences for the children born in those states,” Brown said.

With 22 states part of the initial suits challenging Trump’s birthright citizenship order included, that means the order could impact the 28 states that were not part of the initial suit.

Those 28 states are: Alaska, Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming.

‘The gamesmanship in this request is apparent’

Sotomayor, in her dissent, argued that the Trump administration brought the question of nationwide injunctions before the high court because it would be “an impossible task” to prove the constitutionality of the birthright citizenship executive order.

“So the Government instead tries its hand at a different game. It asks this Court to hold that, no matter how illegal a law or policy, courts can never simply tell the Executive to stop enforcing it against anyone,” she said. “Instead, the Government says, it should be able to apply the Citizenship Order (whose legality it does not defend) to everyone except the plaintiffs who filed this lawsuit.”

“The gamesmanship in this request is apparent and the Government makes no attempt to hide it. Yet, shamefully, this Court plays along,” she continued.

Sotomayor also questioned the irreparable harm the Trump administration would face.

“Simply put, it strains credulity to treat the Executive Branch as irreparably harmed by injunctions that direct it to continue following settled law,” she said.

She argued that the issue of birthright citizenship was ratified in the 14th Amendment of the Constitution in 1868, following the Civil War, to establish citizenship for newly freed Black people. It was meant to rectify a 1857 case in Dred Scott v. Sandford where the Supreme Court initially denied citizenship to Black people, whether they were free or enslaved.

“By stripping all federal courts, including itself, of that power, the Court kneecaps the Judiciary’s authority to stop the Executive from enforcing even the most unconstitutional policies,” Sotomayor said. “That runs directly counter to the point of equity: empowering courts to do complete justice, including through flexible remedies that have historically benefited parties and nonparties alike.”

Origins of birthright citizenship case

The case, Trump v. CASA, was consolidated from three cases.

George Escobar, the chief of programs and services of CASA, which brought the case, said in a statement that the ruling from the high court “undermines the fundamental promise of the Constitution — that every child born on U.S. soil is equal under the law.”

“Today’s decision sends a message to U.S.-born children of immigrants that their place in this country is conditional,” Escobar said. “But we are not backing down.”

The CASA case was on behalf of several pregnant women in Maryland who are not U.S. citizens who filed their case in Maryland; the second came from four states — Washington, Arizona, Illinois, and Oregon — that filed a case in Washington state; and the third came from 18 Democratic state attorneys general who filed the challenge in Massachusetts.

Those 18 states are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin. The District of Columbia and the county and city of San Francisco also joined.

This is not the first time the Supreme Court has addressed the issue of birthright citizenship.

In 1898, the Supreme Court upheld the 14th Amendment, in United States v. Wong Kim Ark, extending birthright citizenship.

In that 19th-century case, Ark was born in San Francisco, California, to parents who were citizens of the Republic of China, but had legal authority to be in the United States, such as a temporary visa. While Ark was born in California, his citizenship was not recognized when he went on a trip to China. Upon his return to California, he was denied reentry due to the Chinese Exclusion Act— a racist law designed to restrict and limit nearly all immigration of Chinese nationals.

When his case went all the way to the Supreme Court, the high court ruled that children born in the U.S. to parents who were not citizens automatically become citizens at birth.

The Trump administration has argued that the 1898 case was misinterpreted and point to a specific phrase: “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States.

Government attorneys contend that the phrase in the 14th Amendment means that birthright citizenship does not apply to people in the U.S. without legal status or temporary legal status who are “subject to the jurisdiction” of their country of origin.

President Trump is getting the Independence Day signing ceremony he's been demanding.

MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:

This is for the megabill he and Republicans in Congress pushed over the finish line yesterday afternoon. Speaking under the wing of Air Force One as he departed for a victory rally in Iowa, Trump said the celebration would include a military aircraft flyover.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And it's going to be a great day. So we'll be signing with those beautiful planes flying right over our heads.

MARTIN: The One Big Beautiful Bill, as President Trump has been calling it, contains the president's entire domestic legislative agenda.

MARTÍNEZ: With more, we're joined now by NPR senior White House correspondent Tamara Keith. So, Tam, what is the president saying about this bill's passage?

TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Well, as you might imagine, he and his allies are taking a victory lap. Trump was in Iowa last night for a rally and said with this bill, he kept every major promise he made to voters when he ran for office last year.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

TRUMP: Very simply, the One Big Beautiful Bill will deliver the strongest border on earth, the strongest economy on earth, the strongest military on earth, and ensure the United States of America will remain the strongest country anywhere on this beautiful planet of ours.

(CHEERING)

KEITH: Trump was, to borrow a word he likes to use, rather braggadocious about his success last night, asking, has anybody ever had a better two weeks?

MARTÍNEZ: Now, 48 hours ago, though, there was some drama. I mean, it looked like that bill and the president's timeline were in trouble. So what happened?

KEITH: Well, there were quite a few Republican holdouts, but President Trump turned on the charm, and then he turned up the pressure. And ultimately, all but two Republicans in the House who had been holding out folded. At a press conference after the bill passed, Majority Leader Steve Scalise gave Trump all the credit.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

STEVE SCALISE: Donald Trump absolutely was our closer, and Donald Trump never stopped - every day was there in the fight. Who do I need to call? What do I need to do? No president more directly engaged.

KEITH: This was a pivotal moment in Trump's presidency and he and his party rose to it. It took all-night debates and arm-twisting and passed with incredibly narrow margins in both the House and the Senate. And the question now is whether it becomes a long-term political win or more of an albatross.

MARTÍNEZ: Oh, OK. Sounds like you're talking about the midterm elections.

KEITH: Indeed. Next year, Republicans in swing districts will have to defend their votes. And so far, public polling has found this bill to be pretty unpopular. Democrats have had a lot of success in branding it as a tax cut for the rich at the expense of the poor and the vulnerable. A senior White House official conceded in a call yesterday with reporters that the president and Republicans are going to have to educate the public on what's actually in the bill, including things that are popular, like no tax on tips or expanding the child tax credit.

And another thing to watch is the Medicaid cuts in the bill, which an independent analysis found would cause nearly 12 million people to lose coverage. Those will phase in more slowly, which may give Republicans some political cover because people often don't draw a direct line between things happening in their lives and something politicians in Washington passed years earlier.

MARTÍNEZ: Yeah. Now, still a lot of uncertainty, though, various global conflicts, the U.S. tariff policy. What challenges lie ahead, though?

KEITH: Well, it depends on how you feel about tariffs. Early next week, Trump's tariff pause is set to end and his administration has not had much success striking trade deals. So he says he's just going to start sending letters to countries telling them how high their tariffs will be going forward. Economists say tariffs are going to hit American consumers, but Trump is unconcerned.

Trump is also burning up the phones to various world leaders, trying to wind down the conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine, and then there's Iran - all of which is to say, a president's work is never done.

The bill combines tax reductions, spending hikes on defence and border security, and cuts to social safety nets.

Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries warned that the bill “hurts everyday Americans and rewards billionaires with massive tax breaks”.

Trump’s erstwhile ally, billionaire Elon Musk, publicly opposed the bill, arguing it would bloat expenditure and the country’s already unmatched debt.

Trump is expected to sign the bill into law on Friday, July 4 – the US’s independence day – at 4pm ET.

Here’s what’s next – and whom the bill will affect:

How have taxes been lowered?

The main goal of the bill was to extend Trump’s first-term tax cuts.

In 2017, Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which lowered taxes and increased the standard deduction for all taxpayers, primarily benefitting higher-income earners.

More than a third of the total cuts went to households with an income of $460,000 or more.

The top 1 percent (roughly 2.4 million people) received average tax cuts of about $61,090 by 2025 – higher than any other income group. By contrast, the middle 60 percent of earners (78 million people) saw cuts in the range of $380 to $1,800.

Those tax breaks were set to expire this year, but the new bill has made them permanent. It also adds some more cuts Trump promised during his latest campaign.

For instance, there is a change to the US tax code called the State and Local Taxes deduction.

This will let taxpayers deduct certain local taxes (like property taxes) from their federal tax return.

Currently, people can only deduct up to $10,000 of these taxes. The new bill would raise that cap from $10,000 to $40,000 for five years.

Taxpayers will also be allowed to deduct income earned from tips and overtime, until 2028, as well as interest paid on loans for buying cars made in the US from this year until 2028.

Elsewhere, the estate tax exemption will rise to $15m for individuals and $30m for married couples.

In all, the legislation contains about $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.

How big are social welfare cuts?

To help offset the cost of the tax cuts, Republicans plan to scale back Medicaid and food assistance programmes for low-income families.

Their stated goal was to focus these programmes on certain groups – primarily pregnant women, people with disabilities and children – while also reducing what they deem to be waste, including by limiting access to immigrants.

Currently, more than 71 million people depend on Medicaid, the government health insurance program.

According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the bill would leave an additional 17 million Americans without health cover in the next decade.

While Medicaid helps Americans suffering from poor health, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) helps poor people afford groceries.

About 40 million Americans currently receive benefits through SNAP, also known as food stamps.

The CBO calculates that 4.7 million SNAP participants will lose out over the 2025-2034 period, due to program reductions.

Changes to Medicaid and SNAP could become permanent provisions, with no sunset clauses attached to them.

A recent White House memo pointed to more than $1 trillion in welfare cuts from the new bill – the largest spending reductions to the US safety net in modern history.

Will there be new money for national security?

The bill sets aside about $350bn, to be spread out over several years, for Trump’s border and national security plans. This includes:

$46bn for the US-Mexico border wall

$45bn to fund 100,000 beds in migrant detention centres

Billions more to hire an extra 10,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents by 2029, as part of Trump’s plan to carry out the largest mass deportation effort in US history.

Will clean energy be affected?

Republicans have rolled back tax incentives that support clean energy projects powered by renewables like solar and wind, instead giving tax breaks to coal and oil companies.

These “green” tax breaks were a part of former President Joe Biden’s landmark Inflation Reduction Act, which aimed to tackle climate change and reduce healthcare costs.

A tax break for people who buy new or used electric vehicles will expire on September 30 this year, instead of at the end of 2032 under current law.

How will the bill affect the US debt profile?

The legislation would raise the debt ceiling by $5 trillion, from $36.2 trillion currently (which amounts to 122 percent of gross domestic product or GDP), going beyond the $4 trillion outlined in the version passed by the House in May.

Washington cannot borrow more than its stated debt ceiling. But since 1960, Congress has raised, suspended or changed the terms of the debt ceiling 78 times, facilitating more leverage and undermining the US’s long-term fiscal stability.

In his first term, Trump oversaw a roughly $8 trillion increase in the federal debt, which surged due to 2017 tax cuts and emergency spending, approved by Congress, during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Debt as a share of GDP was already higher last year than it was anytime outside of World War II, the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis or the COVID-19 pandemic. Deficit concerns contributed to Moody’s downgrading of the US credit score in May.

For its part, the White House claims the new tax bill will reduce projected deficits by more than $1.4 trillion over the next decade, in part by spurring additional growth. But economists on both sides of the aisle have strongly disputed that.

Indeed, according to the non-partisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, interest payments on national debt will rise to $2 trillion per year by 2034 owing to the legislation, crowding out spending on other goods and services.

How did the House of Representatives vote on the bill?

The lower house of the US Congress voted by a margin of 218 to 214 in favour of the bill on Thursday.

All 212 Democratic members of the House opposed the bill. They were joined by Representatives Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, who broke from the Republican majority.

On July 1, the Senate narrowly passed the bill by a 51–50 vote, with the deciding vote cast by Vice President JD Vance.

Who will benefit the most?

According to Yale University’s Budget Lab, wealthier taxpayers are likely to gain more from this bill than lower-income Americans.

They estimate that people in the lowest income bracket will see their incomes drop by 2.5 percent, mainly because of cuts to SNAP and Medicaid, while the highest earners will see their incomes rise by 2.2 percent.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025-07-03T212143Z_111934728_RC29FFAN4G88_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-1751578513.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-07-04 13:21:31.524388

Congress just made it harder to build clean, affordable, and resilient energy systems and the implications for commercial and industrial power users are significant.

The “Big Beautiful Bill,” recently passed in the 119th Congress, eliminates many of the federal incentives that helped make energy storage and renewable energy viable at scale. While some targeted credits remain, the bill rewrites the rules for how clean energy gets financed, manufactured, and deployed. If you’re in the business of keeping critical power flowing or storing it for when the grid can’t, these changes affect you.

Let’s break down what’s in the bill, what’s being removed or preserved, and how companies like EticaAG are adapting to this new energy landscape.

What the Big Beautiful Bill Does

The bill is part energy policy and part industrial strategy. It rolls back core elements of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), including broad-based tax credits, federal funding programs, and emissions-based eligibility rules.

For energy developers and manufacturers, the bill does three main things:

It narrows eligibility for key tax credits by adding domestic content and foreign entity restrictions.

It ends or phases out production credits for clean energy technologies.

It rescinds funding for climate-focused programs and public-sector deployments.

If your project depends on federal support for battery storage, solar, wind, or U.S.-based clean energy manufacturing, this bill demands a complete recalculation.

What’s Being Removed

Clean Energy Tax Credits

The Production Tax Credit (PTC) and Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for clean electricity are gone for most projects. The only path forward is the new §48E credit, which retains a 30 percent base ITC but requires compliance with domestic content rules.

For storage developers, this means:

No ITC at all if your project uses materials or components linked to a “foreign entity of concern” (primarily China).

A 10-year lookback period. If you receive the ITC and later purchase from a restricted supplier, the government claws back the credit—entirely.

48C Advanced Energy Project Credit

The federal government had allocated billions to support new clean energy manufacturing facilities. The Big Beautiful Bill freezes the current 48C pool and blocks any future rounds. Manufacturers still waiting to apply for capital-intensive projects are out of luck.

Clean Energy Grant and Loan Programs

The bill terminates:

DOE’s Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships program.

EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.

Public-sector clean energy grant programs targeting hospitals, schools, and low-income communities.

Without these tools, many state and local governments will be less likely to pursue renewable generation or behind-the-meter storage for peak shaving and backup power.

What’s Being Preserved (and Added)

Despite the sweeping cuts, a few provisions survived. In some cases, they’ve become more attractive for companies that meet the stricter standards.

§48E ITC with Domestic Content Bonuses

Projects that meet rising domestic content thresholds can receive a 10 percent bonus on top of the 30 percent ITC. The requirements climb over time:

40 percent U.S.-sourced material if construction starts before June 2025.

55 percent if it starts after January 1, 2027.

Battery energy storage systems that hit those marks can still pencil out, especially for commercial or utility-scale applications.

§45X Manufacturing Credit

The advanced manufacturing production credit remains, but with phaseouts starting in 2031. For now, it still supports U.S.-based production of:

Battery cells and modules.

Thermal management systems.

Components like harnesses, collector plates, and voltage-sense circuits.

The definition of eligible components has expanded, which benefits vertically integrated companies assembling full systems domestically.

Internal Sales Rule

The bill clarifies that components installed in-house—such as racks, modules, or liquid-cooled assemblies inside a storage container—still qualify for §45X if they’re made in the U.S. This incentivizes domestic integration.

Who Gains and Who Gets Squeezed

The bill reshapes who’s competitive in the clean energy space.

Beneficiaries:

U.S. manufacturers with tight control over their supply chains.

Developers using non-Chinese components with clear documentation.

Vertically integrated firms assembling full systems in one location.

At Risk:

Companies relying on Chinese battery cells, inverters, or software.

Projects delayed beyond 2026 that can’t meet domestic sourcing thresholds.

Commercial and industrial customers expecting rapid ROI based on old credit structures.

Navigating the Policy Shift: EticaAG’s Approach

While this bill creates significant new hurdles, EticaAG is uniquely prepared to meet them.

Domestic Integration

We are planning U.S.-based production beginning in 2026. Our upcoming facility in the Northeast is being developed with §45X and §48E compliance in mind, targeting the 55 percent domestic-content threshold required for future ITC bonuses.

Non-Chinese Components

EticaAG sources non-Chinese electronics and communication systems. This positions us to meet foreign entity restrictions without compromising safety or performance.

Fire-Safe Architecture

Our immersion-cooled battery modules are eligible for expanded §45X credits thanks to their componentized design. Voltage-sense wiring, harnesses, and current collectors are all now part of the “battery module” definition.

Compliance Confidence

We’ve mapped our bill of materials to the new foreign assistance ratio requirements. That means lower compliance risk and no ITC recapture surprises.

What This Means for Commercial and Industrial Energy Users

If you operate a high-load facility like a data center, factory, or large commercial campus, your ability to deploy affordable, compliant storage has changed.

Federal incentives still exist, but only if you partner with suppliers that meet sourcing and documentation requirements.

The cost of delay just increased. Projects that wait until 2027 must meet a 55 percent U.S. content bar or forfeit the bonus credit.

Fire-safe and air-quality-sensitive installations (like hospitals or critical infrastructure) now require more than just specs, they need supply chain transparency too.

Battery energy storage remains essential for peak shaving, backup power, and microgrid resilience. But the margin for error is smaller. Developer decisions now need to factor in component origin, integration model, and ITC eligibility over a 10-year horizon.

Risks Ahead

The Big Beautiful Bill isn’t without its challenges. Even companies that meet today’s standards may fall out of compliance due to:

Supplier ownership changes.

Incomplete documentation from sub-tier vendors.

Shifting interpretations of “foreign assistance” by federal regulators.

The administrative burden is heavy. Each project must be tracked and audited for a decade after commissioning. Mistakes are costly.

Final Thoughts

The Big Beautiful Bill changes the playing field, but it doesn’t eliminate the opportunity. For companies committed to U.S.-based manufacturing and high-integrity systems, the path forward is narrower—but still viable.

At EticaAG, we believe energy storage should be safe, traceable, and sustainable. We’re ready to meet this moment and help our partners do the same.",https://eticaag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/The-Big-Beautiful-Bills-Impact-on-Energy-Storage-and-Renewable-Energy-1024x576.webp,N,,2025-07-04 11:07:49.640000

Here's how.,MIKE FONTHAM,,,,,https://www.nola.com/opinions/guest_columns/politics-ai-data-center/article_7dae532f-97cd-4142-8dc4-acfea73fd211.html,"The data center will require enormous amounts of electricity, and Entergy wants to build three new natural gas generators to serve the center.
It also seeks to build ""clean"" resources not for the data center, but to satisfy Meta's green energy goals.
Meta is obligated to make the payments only until 2041, about 12 years after the data center begins operating.
Will Meta want the data center in 15, 20 or 25 years?
Published estimates place the expected life of a data center at anywhere from 15 and 30 years.","What would it cost to obtain a $6 billion insurance policy, providing coverage for 30 years? My guess is a lot.

What is it worth to get that large a policy for free?

That is exactly what Entergy and Meta are asking the Public Service Commission to order ratepayers to provide for a data center in north Louisiana: an open-ended insurance policy to back up a $6 billion investment. Costs Meta does not pay would be paid by Louisiana consumers.

Meta, through a subsidiary, is building a huge data center in Richland Parish, which Entergy says will create 300 to 500 permanent jobs with an average pay of $82,000. The data center will require enormous amounts of electricity, and Entergy wants to build three new natural gas generators to serve the center. It also seeks to build ""clean"" resources not for the data center, but to satisfy Meta's green energy goals.

Entergy says that Meta's addition will provide overall benefits to customers, presumably because Meta's rate will provide some contribution to paying embedded costs. But Entergy's calculations are secret — available only to parties in the case who sign confidentiality agreements. Even so, the information disclosed in Entergy's filing suggests that the purported benefits are suspect at best.

The proposed new gas generators and direct transmission facilities will cost about $4 billion. The investments will go into Entergy Louisiana's rate base, paid for by all customers, but Meta will pay a rate sufficient to cover the annual investment costs and expenses for these units, spread over 30 years.

The catch? Meta is obligated to make the payments only until 2041, about 12 years after the data center begins operating. The term can be extended in five-year increments.

Will Meta want the data center in 15, 20 or 25 years? With the pace of technological change, it seems doubtful that Meta will want it for the entire 30 years. Published estimates place the expected life of a data center at anywhere from 15 and 30 years. Meta thus is protected; it can terminate at 15 years.

Entergy also says it needs to build a $538 million transmission line in south Louisiana to balance power flows to Meta. The company calls it a ""system"" transmission line, to be paid for by all Entergy Louisiana customers, but admits it is needed only for the addition of Meta. The annual ratepayer cost is $57.6 million.

Entergy says it will acquire 1,500 megawatts of solar generation to support Meta's green energy goals. If Entergy constructs it, the cost will likely exceed $1.5 billion. Meta will pay a ""levelized"" annual cost, like a mortgage. The cost is lower than the actual cost on the front end and higher on the back end, when Meta can escape the contract. Ratepayers will pay amounts not paid by Meta.

To further show Meta's commitment to green energy, Entergy plans to equip an existing gas unit with carbon capture equipment. That will cost more than $1 billion, lower the unit's capacity and make it less efficient. Meta will pay a capped amount toward the cost of the equipment. The filing does not say who pays to transport and sequester the carbon.

Clean energy entitles a party to obtain large tax credits and other benefits. Those go to Meta.

Meta will profit greatly from the deal and has protected itself from most of the risk. Entergy will also profit, selling more than 2,500 megawatt-hours of electricity per hour or more, around the clock, for years. Meta will add about 50% to Entergy Louisiana's sales. But Entergy assumes none of the risks. Those it seeks to impose on consumers.

Gov. Jeff Landry and Entergy have touted the project as an economic boon, and it has strong momentum. But even 500 jobs at $82,000 on average will produce only $41 million for Meta's employees and after taxes, less. The ""system"" transmission line in south Louisiana will cost more annually than that.

The obvious answer is to require Entergy and Meta to take some or all of the risk, since profits normally entail risk in commerce. Will the PSC take that route, or will it commit ratepayers to a huge open-ended insurance obligation?

Put another way: Whom will the PSC protect?",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/95/7956670a-6fbe-55e4-bc31-5632691a262e/68017d818f070.image.jpg?crop=1457%2C765%2C0%2C2&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-07-04 22:07:40.840238

The U.S. will rely on oil, gas, coal and nuclear to meet its growing energy needs, the president said last weekend, bashing wind and solar power.
The tax credit was designed to support nascent technology that captures carbon emissions and stores them underground.
A related tax credit for using U.S.-made components in solar and wind farms ends for projects that enter service after 2027.
“If nothing changes, factories start to close,” Michael Carr, executive director of the Solar Energy Manufacturers Association, told CNBC.","President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act ends long-standing federal support for solar and wind power, while creating a friendly environment for oil, gas and coal production.

The House of Representatives passed Trump’s megabill Thursday ahead of a White House-imposed deadline, after the Senate narrowly approved the controversial legislation Tuesday.

Trump has made his priorities on energy production clear. The U.S. will rely on oil, gas, coal and nuclear to meet its growing energy needs, the president said last weekend, bashing wind and solar power.

“I don’t want windmills destroying our place,” Trump told Fox News in an interview that aired June 29. “I don’t want these solar things where they go for miles and they cover up a half a mountain that are ugly as hell.”

The president’s embrace of fossil fuels and hostility to renewable energy is reflected in his signature domestic policy law. It delivers most of the oil and gas sector’s top priorities, according to the industry’s lobby group, while ending tax credits that have played a crucial role in the growth of solar and wind power.

Oil, gas and coal are winners

The law opens up federal lands and waters to oil and gas drilling after the Biden administration enacted curbs, mandating 30 lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico over 15 years, more than 30 every year on lands across nine states and giving the industry access to Alaska.

The law also slashes the royalties that producers pay the government for pumping oil and gas on federal lands, encouraging higher output.

“This bill will be the most transformational legislation that we’ve seen in decades in terms of access to both federal lands and federal waters,” Mike Sommers, president of the American Petroleum Institute, an industry lobbying group, told CNBC. “It includes almost all of our priorities.”

The law also spurs oil companies to use a carbon capture tax credit to produce more crude. The tax credit was designed to support nascent technology that captures carbon emissions and stores them underground. Under Trump’s bill, producers would receive an increased tax benefit for injecting those emissions into wells to produce more oil.

The law ends the hydrogen tax credit in 2028, later than previous versions of the bill. Chevron, Exxon and others are investing in projects to produce hydrogen fuel.

“I have a number of members who plan on investing significantly in hydrogen and so the extension to the end of 2028 was a welcome priority that was fulfilled,” Sommers said.

The coal industry is also a big winner from the law, which mandates at least 4 million additional acres of federal land be made available for mining. The law also cuts the royalties that coal companies pay the government for mining on federal land, and allows the use of an advanced manufacturing tax credit for mining metallurgical coal used to make steel.

Solar and wind are losers

The law phases out clean electricity investment and production tax credits for wind and solar that have played a crucial role in the growth of the renewable energy industry. The investment credit has been in place since 2005 and the production credit since 1992. The Inflation Reduction Act extended the life of both until at least 2032.

Solar and wind farms that enter service after 2027 would no longer be eligible for the credits. There is an exception, however, for projects that start construction within 12 months of the bill becoming law.

The phaseout is more gradual than previous versions of the legislation, which had a hard deadline of December 31, 2027. That gave all solar and wind projects just 2.5 years to come online in order to take advantage of the credits.

“Despite limited improvements, this legislation undermines the very foundation of America’s manufacturing comeback and global energy leadership,” Abigail Ross Hopper, CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association, said in a statement when the bill passed the Senate.

A related tax credit for using U.S.-made components in solar and wind farms ends for projects that enter service after 2027. A carveout allows projects that start construction within one year of the law’s enactment to claim the credit. The credit was designed to spur demand at U.S. factories in order to break the nation’s dependence on equipment from China.

“If nothing changes, factories start to close,” Michael Carr, executive director of the Solar Energy Manufacturers Association, told CNBC. “Factories that are on the drawing board that probably penciled [favorably] two weeks ago, maybe don’t pencil now. We’ll see investment slow down in the sector going forward.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/250703-pumpjacks-texas-aa-538-45928e.jpg",N,,2025-07-04 11:09:05.092208

The San Francisco Board of Supervisors unanimously approved the lease with Skycharger on June 10. The hub will serve electric rideshare vehicles, such as Uber and Lyft, as well as EV-driving airport customers and the general public. In April, the SFO Airport Commission unanimously approved Skycharger’s lease agreement.

The EV Hub will support SFO’s sustainability efforts, advancing its zero net carbon operations goal. It will also meet the expected rise in charging demand from rideshare vehicles, driven by California’s Clean Miles Standard, which requires 90% of Uber and Lyft miles to be electric by 2030. Skycharger estimates the EV Hub will avoid more than 200,000 tons of CO2 equivalent in its first 10 years of operation.

Skycharger Fast-Charging Hub

The EV Hub will be built with the support of Burns & McDonnell, an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) firm. It will feature high-capacity chargers to minimize charging times, with 400 kW charging ports to future-proof the site for vehicles designed for higher rates of charge. The hub will also include a convenience store.

Skycharger has selected Kempower to supply its EV charging hardware for the project. Kempower will provide 12 Power cabinets and 24 Satellite dispensers, enabling dynamic power distribution across the site.

“We’re moving quickly to bring this hub online,” said Johannes Copeland, COO of Skycharger. “Kempower’s flexible, high-performance charging technology is the right fit for this mission-critical deployment at one of the busiest airports in the country.”

Previous Projects

Skycharger’s SFO EV Hub award follows a recent $10 million grant from the California Energy Commission. The grant will help design, construct and operate two publicly accessible electric truck stops along I-5 in Southern California.

What this means is that the American people are paying for solar power that Californians do not demand.
This leads to a shortage of abundant, reliable forms of energy, which, in turn, creates an affordability crisis for families, particularly during severe weather events.
Pro-growth tax policies, a common-sense regulatory climate, and reliable energy are critical foundations for American prosperity.
The new tax bill makes progress in each of these areas.","Aside from extending the 2017 tax reforms, the most important policy success in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) that is now headed to President Trump’s desk is the new law’s energy policy. Coupled with tax cuts and regulatory reform, the megabill’s support for abundant, reliable, and affordable energy will spur investment, mitigate inflation, and accelerate economic growth and job creation, particularly to the benefit of lower income Americans.

By allowing companies to deduct the full amount of capital investments upfront rather than writing them off over several years, the new tax bill paves the way for more factories, data centers, defense and satellite labs, warehouses, logistic hubs, telecom and medical infrastructure. These R&D investments will only increase demand for reliable base load power. A base load generator, like a nuclear reactor, produces a consistent amount of power while in operation. Its output is not variable with the weather.

Simply put, energy is the platform that modern industry (and life) is built on. The ability for Americans to afford basic necessities from modern medical care to air conditioning, home heating, gas-powered transit, and household staples depends on an abundance of affordable, reliable energy. So does America’s ability to win the global artificial intelligence (AI) race, which will be critical in the 21st century. McKinsey forecasts that global demand for data centers could triple by 2030, with AI responsible for 70% of the demand.

Although the eleventh-hour carveout giving wind and solar producers a one-year runway to initiate subsidized projects is a disappointment, the new tax and spending law takes important steps to meet the rising energy demands from advanced manufacturing, chip fabs, robotics, and data centers. First and foremost, the bill protects grid reliability by setting an end date for subsidies for wind and solar power, turning the page on the “all of the above” sleight of hand that provided cover for energy malinvestment. If allowed to expire on the extended timeline set in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the wind, solar, and electric vehicle (EV) handouts would have cost taxpayers as much as $3 trillion by 2050. And yet, this massive giveaway undermined the reliability of the grid by reducing revenues for and investment in base load power generation.

Once they collect subsidies, wind and solar providers can still make money even if they charge less than their production costs. In California, the wholesale price of electricity has become negative for a greater share of the day since the passage of the IRA. What this means is that the American people are paying for solar power that Californians do not demand.

Meanwhile, reliable base load generators—hydro, nuclear, coal and geothermal—face falling revenues despite providing immense value to the grid by reducing volatility. This leads to a shortage of abundant, reliable forms of energy, which, in turn, creates an affordability crisis for families, particularly during severe weather events. Winter Storm Uri, the February 2021 freeze that left millions of Texans without power, is estimated to have cost the state’s ratepayers over 37 billion dollars. Households were hit with bills as high as $7,000.

The bill also removes barriers for oil and gas exploration on public lands. The increased output and lower royalty rates on domestic production will bolster economic growth, lower prices at the pump, and reduce home electricity costs, which disproportionately affects Americans who earn lower incomes.

In a win for consumer choice, the megabill phases out EV subsidies, which, when combined with mandates that pushed Americans to purchase these vehicles, could have been one of the most expensive parts of the IRA. It also defunds enforcement of the anachronistic Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, a regulatory shift that is expected to save automakers billions of dollars and consumers up to $1,620 per vehicle, according to industry groups. Together, the EV phase out and the CAFE pullback are clear wins for lower income Americans, who benefit most from lower car prices.

By the same token, OBBBA continues to invest in nuclear, geothermal, and batteries. Although an equal opportunity policy toward energy is ideal—where the government sets a regulatory environment that allows the various sources of energy to compete freely against each other in the marketplace—greater investment in nuclear, geothermal, and batteries will at least help to reduce the risk of further reliability crises that were exacerbated by the subsidies in the IRA and state-level regulations that gave explicit preference to wind and solar.

Pro-growth tax policies, a common-sense regulatory climate, and reliable energy are critical foundations for American prosperity. The new tax bill makes progress in each of these areas. While the tax and regulatory reforms may have the largest impact in the near term, the megabill’s energy reset may be even more consequential over the long haul. It nixes hundreds of billions of dollars in future subsidies that would have padded the balance sheets of Big Solar and Big Wind and averts a grid meltdown. For Americans on the bottom half of the ladder, that’s no small victory.",https://assets.realclear.com/images/69/691268_6_.jpeg,N,,2025-07-05 17:07:28.592783

OLYMPIA — Governor Bob Ferguson today detailed the devastating impacts of Donald Trump’s reconciliation bill on Washington’s clean economy, environment and energy future.

The bill passed out of Congress today puts at least $8.7 billion in Washington’s clean energy investments at risk.

Under the bill, Republicans voted to phase out federal incentives for wind, solar and other clean technologies by 2028. Meanwhile, they maintained and expanded subsidies for fossil fuel industries.

“This bill is anything but beautiful for Washington. It’s a fossil fuel wish list that penalizes clean energy and favors pollution,” Governor Ferguson said. “Donald Trump and the MAGA Congress are dismantling the very incentives that have powered innovation, created jobs, lowered electricity costs and protected the environment. At a time when we should be advancing clean energy, these rollbacks are a disastrous step in the wrong direction.”

The U.S. Climate Alliance estimates 21,800 Washingtonians will lose their jobs by 2030 due to the reconciliation bill’s reduction in clean energy and manufacturing tax credits.

The legislation threatens Washington’s energy security and electric grid reliability by stifling solar, wind and battery resources at a time of soaring electricity demand. The U.S. Climate Alliance estimates the bill’s removal of wind and solar energy tax credits will raise Washington households’ electricity costs by $115 per year by 2029.

One of Republicans’ biggest victories in the bill is the extension of deep tax cuts enacted during Trump’s first term, which are estimated to cost the country more than $4 trillion over 10 years. The legislation also directs roughly $325 billion to the military and to border security, while cutting nearly $1 trillion in funding for Medicaid, the joint state and federal program that covers medical costs for lower-income people.

To pay for the tax breaks, the bill sunsets clean energy tax credits that were put in place by the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, making wind and solar projects ineligible unless they start construction before July 2026 or are placed in service by 2027. It also imposes an expedited phaseout of consumer tax credits for new and used electric vehicles — by September 30 this year instead of by 2032. Green groups described the legislation as “historically ruinous” and “a self-inflicted tragedy for our country.”

Once Trump signs the megabill, however, the U.S. will have no federal plan to address the climate crisis.

Broader Cuts and Political Fallout

“Every lawmaker who voted for this cynical measure chose tax cuts for the wealthiest over Americans’ health, pocketbooks, public lands, and waters — and a safe climate. They should be ashamed,” said Manish Bapna, president of the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council, in a statement.

Agriculture experts have also objected to Trump’s policy bill, which removes the requirement that unobligated climate-targeted funds from the IRA be funneled toward climate-specific projects — in part so they can be directed toward programs under the current farm bill, an omnibus bill for food and agriculture that the federal government renews every five to six years. The Trump megabill seeks to increase subsidies to commodity farms by about $50 billion.

The final version of the bill doesn’t include a proposal to sell off millions of acres of public lands; this was dropped following outcry from the public and some conservation-minded GOP lawmakers. It also lacks stringent limits on the use of Chinese components in renewable energy projects that were proposed in an earlier version of the bill. Some Republican lawmakers in both the House and Senate voted for the legislation in exchange for carveouts in their states, like reduced work requirements for food stamps and less severe health care cuts.

All Democrats voted against the bill. Immediately preceding the House vote, Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York railed against the policy in a record-breaking 8-hour-and-45-minute House floor speech invoking scripture: “Our job is to stand up for the poor, the sick, and the afflicted,” he said.

Members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus have promised to hold Republicans accountable. More than three dozen of its members have said they’ll hold “Accountability Summer” events lambasting Republican lawmakers who supported the bill. “As Democrats, we must make sure they never live that down,” the group’s chair, Greg Casar, a Democrat of Texas, said in a statement.

Similarly, Senator Brian Schatz, a Democrat for Hawaiʻi, told The New York Times that his party should use the megabill’s spending cuts as a cudgel against Republicans ahead of next year’s midterm elections: “Our job is to point out, when kids get less to eat, when rural hospitals shutter, when the price of electricity goes up, that this is because of what your Republican elected official did,” he said.

“This budget bill is the largest-ever transfer of wealth from working families to the ultra-rich and one of the most environmentally destructive pieces of legislation in US history,” said Collin Rees, campaigns manager at Oil Change International.
“All that and much more has already transpired on an administrative level throughout the federal government in under six months, and will now be codified and expanded upon by this budget bill.
Incentives for home solar and heat pumps, tax credits for buying an electric vehicle—all these could be erased.” And they were erased.","The US Congress has voted to approve Donald Trump’s astonishing “big beautiful bill,” effectively ending credits for wind, solar and EVs in the country, and in a move that some environmentalists say could condemn the world to a catastrophic 3°C of average global warming.

The passage of the bill through the Senate and the House were flagged as tight, but the assumed Republican holdouts quickly sold their “principles” in return for a few dollars and some local programs of little consequence. The impact on the rest of the world could be extreme.

The vote in the House on Thursday (US time) was followed by an extraordinary series of tweets and social media posts, celebrating not just the evisceration of Joe Biden’s Clean Energy Act, but the removal of social welfare support and healthcare to tens of millions across the country.

It confirms to many that the Republican Party has lost its collective mind, if that was not already abundantly clear. The bill is more or less as promised by Trump to the fossil fuel industry in return for an estimated $1 billion of support in his election campaign.

It comes as science and health programs are trashed, the judiciary is attacked, and human rights – including the fundamental right to live in a safe environment – are thrown out the door.

The bill provides trillions of dollars in tax cuts, mostly to the rich and ultra rich, provides more incentives ($US18 billion) and strips back regulations for the fossil fuel industry, and dismantles most incentives for clean energy.

“This budget bill is the largest-ever transfer of wealth from working families to the ultra-rich and one of the most environmentally destructive pieces of legislation in US history,” said Collin Rees, campaigns manager at Oil Change International.

“Congress voted today to turn its back on the very industries that are adding the majority of the new electricity generating capacity to the grid,” added Abby Hooper, the president of the Solar Energies Industry Association.

“Many brand new factories will close. Americans will lose their jobs. Investments will be cancelled. Consumers will have fewer choices. Our electric grids will suffer. And the race for the most strategic and innovative technologies will be handed to China.”

These are powerful words, but sadly of little consequence in a world where up is down, black is white, and greed is not just good, it’s great. The “big beautiful bill” is, on any reasonable assessment, the “big, beautiful lie.”

One analysis says that wind and solar generation capacity could fall by 340 gigawatts – below what could have been – and consumer utility rates may rise by 10 to 18 per cent over the next 10 years. And hundreds of thousands of jobs in the clean energy sector are expected to be lost.

An analysis by the REPEAT Project from the Princeton University Zero Lab and Evolved Energy Research shows that the bill is expected to contribute an additional 470 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions per year by 2035.

That is the annual equivalent of more than 100 million gas-powered cars on the road, and more than the annual net emissions from Australia’s entire economy.

In the last week, climate scientists have warned of the catastrophic impacts of global warming, saving that the carbon budget to limit average global warming below 1.5°C will be exhausted in two years, and the budget to limit warming below 2°C will be exhausted in nine years.

The US bill, scientists say, will make it difficult for the world to cap warming much below 3°C, particularly as Trump’s actions give cover for other countries to be less ambitious. Just look at Queensland to see how.

The Trump administration does not want this to be widely known, and this week shut down the Global Change Research Program’s website, globalchange.gov, along with all five versions of the National Climate Assessment report and extensive information on how global warming is affecting the country.

“They’re public documents. It’s scientific censorship at its worst,” said Peter Gleick, a California water and climate scientist who was one of the authors of the first National Climate Assessment in 2000. “This is the modern version of book burning.”

All of this should be a surprise to no-one, and particularly Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who has fallen out with Trump despite spending more than $A400 million backing his campaign.

As CurrentAffairs.org wrote this week:

“These actions and policies fulfill promises made on the campaign trail. As a candidate in 2024, Donald Trump propositioned oil company executives for $1 billion in campaign contributions.

“In return, he swore to roll out the red carpet for drilling on public lands, rolling back rules for power plant emissions and methane emissions from oil and gas fields. He promised to kill the electric car and renewable energy.

“All that and much more has already transpired on an administrative level throughout the federal government in under six months, and will now be codified and expanded upon by this budget bill. Incentives for home solar and heat pumps, tax credits for buying an electric vehicle—all these could be erased.”

And they were erased. And it’s not just book burning – now the White House will get to host a UFC fight on its front lawn. One day a Tesla car yard, the next day a fighting circus. The administration, and our future, is open to the highest bidder, and guess who has the deepest pockets.",https://reneweconomy.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/20250704170040600877-original-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-07-04 12:24:28.168058

President Trump is getting the Independence Day signing ceremony he's been demanding.

MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:

This is for the megabill he and Republicans in Congress pushed over the finish line yesterday afternoon. Speaking under the wing of Air Force One as he departed for a victory rally in Iowa, Trump said the celebration would include a military aircraft flyover.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And it's going to be a great day. So we'll be signing with those beautiful planes flying right over our heads.

MARTIN: The One Big Beautiful Bill, as President Trump has been calling it, contains the president's entire domestic legislative agenda.

MARTÍNEZ: With more, we're joined now by NPR senior White House correspondent Tamara Keith. So, Tam, what is the president saying about this bill's passage?

TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Well, as you might imagine, he and his allies are taking a victory lap. Trump was in Iowa last night for a rally and said with this bill, he kept every major promise he made to voters when he ran for office last year.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

TRUMP: Very simply, the One Big Beautiful Bill will deliver the strongest border on earth, the strongest economy on earth, the strongest military on earth, and ensure the United States of America will remain the strongest country anywhere on this beautiful planet of ours.

(CHEERING)

KEITH: Trump was, to borrow a word he likes to use, rather braggadocious about his success last night, asking, has anybody ever had a better two weeks?

MARTÍNEZ: Now, 48 hours ago, though, there was some drama. I mean, it looked like that bill and the president's timeline were in trouble. So what happened?

KEITH: Well, there were quite a few Republican holdouts, but President Trump turned on the charm, and then he turned up the pressure. And ultimately, all but two Republicans in the House who had been holding out folded. At a press conference after the bill passed, Majority Leader Steve Scalise gave Trump all the credit.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

STEVE SCALISE: Donald Trump absolutely was our closer, and Donald Trump never stopped - every day was there in the fight. Who do I need to call? What do I need to do? No president more directly engaged.

KEITH: This was a pivotal moment in Trump's presidency and he and his party rose to it. It took all-night debates and arm-twisting and passed with incredibly narrow margins in both the House and the Senate. And the question now is whether it becomes a long-term political win or more of an albatross.

MARTÍNEZ: Oh, OK. Sounds like you're talking about the midterm elections.

KEITH: Indeed. Next year, Republicans in swing districts will have to defend their votes. And so far, public polling has found this bill to be pretty unpopular. Democrats have had a lot of success in branding it as a tax cut for the rich at the expense of the poor and the vulnerable. A senior White House official conceded in a call yesterday with reporters that the president and Republicans are going to have to educate the public on what's actually in the bill, including things that are popular, like no tax on tips or expanding the child tax credit.

And another thing to watch is the Medicaid cuts in the bill, which an independent analysis found would cause nearly 12 million people to lose coverage. Those will phase in more slowly, which may give Republicans some political cover because people often don't draw a direct line between things happening in their lives and something politicians in Washington passed years earlier.

MARTÍNEZ: Yeah. Now, still a lot of uncertainty, though, various global conflicts, the U.S. tariff policy. What challenges lie ahead, though?

KEITH: Well, it depends on how you feel about tariffs. Early next week, Trump's tariff pause is set to end and his administration has not had much success striking trade deals. So he says he's just going to start sending letters to countries telling them how high their tariffs will be going forward. Economists say tariffs are going to hit American consumers, but Trump is unconcerned.

Trump is also burning up the phones to various world leaders, trying to wind down the conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine, and then there's Iran - all of which is to say, a president's work is never done.

MARTÍNEZ: NPR's senior White House correspondent Tamara Keith. Thanks.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright recently urged the Senate to fully fund the LPO, calling it ‘the most efficient tool’ for supporting early-stage energy technologies.

Law firm Holland & Knight said in a May blog about the reconciliation bill’s potential impact on the LPO:

“Secretary Wright’s comments follow a period of growing interest in LPO-backed investments – from advanced nuclear to critical materials supply chains – that align with the Trump Administration’s goals for energy dominance, supply chain security and grid resilience.”

“As the Senate takes up its version of the reconciliation package, stakeholders across industry and government will be watching closely to see how these priorities are reflected in the final outcome.”

Recent activity from the LPO has been aimed at restarting the Palisades Nuclear Plant in Michigan.

On 20 June, the office announced the release of a fourth loan to help fund the plant’s restart, disbursing US$100,451,904 of the up to US$1.52 billion loan guarantee.

Nathan Kroeker, Eos Chief Commercial Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer said of the company’s loan advance:

""It came as a complete shock,"" said Jason Grumet, chief executive of the American Clean Power Association, which represents renewable energy producers.

The new tax ""is so carelessly written and haphazardly drafted that the concern is it will create uncertainty and freeze the markets,"" Grumet was quoted by the New York Times as saying.

Grumet is among many industry analysts warning that the bill could deal a major blow to the US clean energy transition, undermining investment confidence, stalling innovation and jeopardizing long-term job growth in the sector.

For example, the American Clean Power Association called the legislation a ""step backward for American energy policy,"" cautioning that it could eliminate jobs and drive up electricity costs.

According to projections from Energy Innovation and researchers at Wellesley College's Environmental Studies Department, the bill threatens 4,500 clean energy projects, puts hundreds of thousands of jobs at risk, and could add billions of dollars to Americans' annual energy bills within five years, Newsweek reported.

Meanwhile, electric vehicle makers also stand to lose. Before the bill's passage, new electric vehicles were eligible for a $7,500 federal tax credit, while used EVs could qualify for a credit of up to $4,000. Those incentives were originally designed to help make the vehicles more affordable.

The bill runs counter to global green transition efforts, dealing a blow not only to America's clean energy sector but to global sustainability at large. While domestic backlash has been swift, the bill is also raising concerns abroad, particularly over its potential to undermine international clean energy cooperation and climate commitments.

""Emissions will increase significantly,"" said Robbie Orvis, senior director of modeling and analysis at the climate policy think tank Energy Innovation.

""There will be less clean energy deployed, replaced by a mix of gas and coal in the power sector,"" Orvis was quoted by Scientific American as saying on Thursday, which noted that the United States (US) is the world's second-largest greenhouse gas emitter and the biggest historical contributor to climate change.

The broader implications of the bill have also sparked sharp criticism from environmental advocates.

After months of intense back-and-forth negotiations, on-the-floor haggling and threats to tank the legislation, Republicans’ massive tax and spending bill is heading to President Donald Trump’s desk to become law.

The wide-ranging megabill is the vehicle for much of Trump’s domestic policy agenda for his second term in the White House, with major changes in health care, immigration and tax policy that are sure to touch nearly every American. Here are the major ways Texas will be affected.

ACA and Medicaid

Over 300,000 Texans could lose their health insurance once the Medicaid changes passed by Congress take effect in 2027.

Medicaid, a federal-state health insurance program for low-income and disabled people, insures over 4 million Texans. The federal government paid for nearly two-thirds of the program’s $57 billion costs in Texas during the 2023 fiscal year, according to KFF, a nonprofit health policy organization. Using estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, KFF projects that Texas stands to lose 10% of its federal Medicaid funds over the next decade, or $39 billion.

The cuts could be particularly potent in the Rio Grande Valley, which has an outsized number of Medicaid recipients, and in rural areas, where hospitals rely on Medicaid payments. Texas already has the highest uninsured rate in the nation.

Beyond Medicaid, the bill makes it harder to enroll in coverage through Affordable Care Act marketplaces and allows for the expiration of Biden-era enhanced premium tax credits that lower out-of-pocket costs for people with ACA marketplace coverage. Because Texas is among the 10 states that have never expanded Medicaid under the ACA, its residents rely heavily on marketplace coverage and the soon-to-expire tax credits.

Taken together, KFF estimates that the megabill’s provisions will lead to 1.7 million Texans losing their coverage, adding to the nearly 5 million children and adults under 65 who currently lack health insurance.

The GOP megabill also imposes nationwide work requirements on Medicaid for the first time in the program’s history. Recipients between the ages of 19 and 64 — except for those with disabilities or with dependent children under 14 — will have to prove they are working or in school for 80 hours per month. In states that implemented work requirements under a program from Trump’s first term, enrollment dropped precipitously, including among people who were working or qualified for an exception but struggled to document it.

Texas Health and Human Services will be responsible for designing and enforcing work requirements that comply with the new federal law.

Before the Senate passed the bill this week, Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said in a floor speech that the work requirements would strengthen Medicaid for its intended recipients — children, the disabled and pregnant women.

“It’s not fair to the taxpayer to have them subsidize people sitting on the couch playing video games all day when they can contribute to their community and their family,” he said.

Texas Democrats have homed in on Medicaid cuts as the most devastating portion of the bill.

“You’re talking about a health care disaster that is going to take place — not just in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, but in every major metropolitan area in the state,” said Rep. Marc Veasey, D-Fort Worth. “When you add that on top of the rural hospitals that are going to close and the smaller areas in Texas, it’s going to create a health care nightmare scenario.”

SNAP

The Republican bill also includes deep cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, previously known as food stamps.

But the size of Texas’ SNAP cut is up in the air, dependent on how often the state errs in over- or underpaying benefit recipients.

Under the bill, states will have to cover a portion of SNAP benefits — which are currently paid for by the federal government in full — based on the percentage of erroneous payments made. States with an error rate under 6% will not have to share the cost, while states above that will be on the hook for escalating costs tied to their error rate.

Texas logged an error rate of 8.3% in fiscal 2024 — meaning that, had the law been in place, the state would have been responsible for 10% of the cost of SNAP benefits, or $716 million per year, according to the North Texas Food Bank.

The SNAP benefit cut is scheduled to kick in fiscal 2028, unless Texas’ error rate falls under 6 percent. States with the highest rates of over- or underpayments — anything above 13.3% can delay the onset of the cost sharing, a last-minute provision included to win the support of Sen. Lisa Murowski, R-Alaska

In addition, Texas will now need to pay for 75% of the administrative cost of running the SNAP program, up from the current 50% rate. Feeding Texas, the statewide network of food banks, estimates that the new arrangement will cost the state $89.5 million annually.

Republicans also tightened SNAP work requirements in the bill. Previously, recipients over age 52 and those with children under 18 in their house were exempted from having to meet such requirements. Now, able-bodied Texans between the ages of 52 and 65 and those with children over 14 must prove they are working at least 80 hours per month to qualify for benefits.

Immigration and the border

Among the top priorities for Texas members was securing money to reimburse the state for the billions it spent on immigration enforcement along the southern border under the Biden administration. That money is now poised to flow to Texas after making it into the bill’s final draft.

Gov. Greg Abbott, who spearheaded the state’s multibillion-dollar border security program known as Operation Lone Star, has been lobbying Trump and lawmakers for federal dollars since Biden left office in January.

Texas’ GOP delegation at first pushed congressional leaders to include $12 billion in reimbursements for states that spent money on border enforcement. Cornyn secured an additional $1.5 billion in the Senate version, upping the available grants to $13.5 billion. The rules for this pot of money ensure that Texas has the largest claim to the funds of any state.

Apart from these grants, GOP lawmakers gave U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement nearly $30 billion to revamp its workforce and equipment, with the goal of speeding the agency’s rate of deportations — a hallmark Trump campaign pledge.

The reconciliation bill also puts billions into new surveillance technology and construction of a wall along the southern border.

Clean energy

The bill rolled back several key provisions of former President Joe Biden’s landmark Inflation Reduction Act, which created tax credits for clean energy projects to spur industry investment.

Those subsidies will be phased out under a provision that reserves the tax credits only for solar and wind projects that are up and running by the end of 2027. Projects that start construction within a year of the law’s enactment — including those that become operational post-2027 — also will remain eligible.

Several Republicans, including U.S. Rep. Chip Roy of Austin, wanted to see the credits abolished immediately. Roy claimed that clean energy cannot reliably power Texas’ grid, as some energy generators, such as solar panels and wind turbines, can only produce electricity in favorable weather conditions. He also said the credits subsidize foreign manufacturers whose renewable energy products dominate the American market.

Clean energy advocates say any cuts are bound to hamper the Texas labor market, as workers on renewable projects could be fired as their employers’ tax incentives disappear. With Texans’ energy demand expected to skyrocket in the next decade, supporters say clean energy could quickly and cheaply fill in the gaps.

Tax cuts

The centerpiece of the Republican megabill is the extension of an array of income tax cuts from the 2017 tax-cut package Trump signed into law during his first term.

Set to expire at the end of the year, the cuts were permanently enshrined in the bill, allowing most Americans to continue benefiting.

Republicans on the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee estimate that a family of four earning the median income in Texas — $75,780 — would have seen its tax bill rise by $1,550 if the 2017 cuts had expired and tax rates had reverted to their Obama-era levels.

Independent analyses of the bill have found that its benefits will mostly flow to the wealthy, while tax savings for the lowest earners will be largely offset by benefit cuts.

A state-by-state analysis by the Institute of Taxation and Economic Policy, a left-leaning think tank, found that the top 1% of Texans — or those making over $806,800 — will see the biggest share of the tax cuts. Those top earners will save 3.4%, or an average of $114,680 per year, on their federal income tax due to the passage of the bill.

The richest Texans will receive a larger average tax cut than their top one percent counterparts in all but two other states, according to the ITEP analysis.

Though the bill’s tax-cut provisions largely focused on preserving existing cuts, Republicans also created a host of new temporary tax relief programs aimed at workers and seniors. Texans who work in roles that traditionally receive tips will get to claim a deduction of up to $25,000 — a priority of Sen. Ted Cruz — through 2028. Those earning overtime can deduct up to $12,500 through the same time period, with lesser deductions for high earners.

And seniors can add $6,000 to their standard deduction, also through the 2028 tax year.

Trump accounts

Born out of a late-night poker game last year, Cruz championed the idea of “Trump accounts,” a provision included in the bill that will seed $1,000 in a tax-deferred investment account for nearly every child born in America in 2025 and beyond. As each recipient ages into adulthood, family, friends and nonprofits will be able to contribute up to $5,000 annually. Once they reach 18, the beneficiaries will be able to access half the funds for limited purposes — such as educational expenses, starting a small business or placing a down payment on a home. They can withdraw the rest once they reach age 31.

To accrue wealth, the account will be pegged to a broad stock index that has yet to be determined. Assuming an average market growth of 7% per year, the accounts will be worth anywhere from $3,500 to $170,000 after 18 years, depending on yearly contribution amounts.

Children born between 2025 and 2028 will be automatically enrolled in the program via their parents’ tax returns as part of the initiative’s pilot program. It is set to cost about $3 billion a year.

Cruz views the new accounts as a way to sell the next generation of American children on the free-market system.

“It gives every kid some skin in the game,” he said in an interview with The Texas Tribune earlier this month.

Pell Grant program

The megabill narrowly avoided cuts to the Pell Grant that would have devastated nearly half a million Texas students who depend on the aid to pay for college.

The House initially proposed stricter requirements to qualify for the Pell Grant, which helps cover costs for low-income students and is the largest source of grant aid in Texas. Students would have had to take more college credits each semester to get the full award, and students who are enrolled less than half-time would have lost access to the aid entirely.

In the end, the Senate stripped those changes after college access advocates sounded alarms about the educational barriers they would have raised.

The bill does prevent students from qualifying for the Pell Grant if their college already covers the full cost of attendance. Many schools across Texas offer so-called ""promise programs"" that cover tuition and fees after Pell grant kicks in.

Republicans on Capitol Hill also extended Pell Grants to short-term workforce training programs, which can last just eight to 15 weeks. Some GOP members tried to make unaccredited training programs eligible for the aid, but the proposal was quashed by the Senate parliamentarian.

Incentives for K-12 scholarships

The legislation also includes one of Cruz’s priorities: annual tax credits for people who donate to nonprofits that give scholarships to elementary and secondary school students — a framework supporters call “school choice” and that is similar to private school vouchers.

To comply with Senate parliamentary rules, Cruz’s original proposal was scaled back so it could pass the chamber with a simple majority rather than the typical 60-vote threshold needed to overcome a filibuster.

Under the provision, donors will receive a tax break equal to the amount they give to K-12 scholarship-granting organizations, including those that help students pay to attend private schools. The credit will max out at $1,700 annually, down from an earlier cap of 10% of the donor’s income, and states will get to opt in, meaning Democratic-controlled states could decline to participate.

This caveat, which was added in Senate negotiations, almost certainly sets the stage for another round of political fights in states wary of incentivizing private school attendance with public dollars.

Despite the trepidation, Cruz touted the measure repeatedly, calling school choice the “civil rights issue of the 21st century.”

Moving the Space Shuttle Discovery

Another provision secured by Cornyn requires the NASA administrator to consider moving the Space Shuttle Discovery from its current home in Virginia to the Johnson Space Center in Houston.

In 2010, the NASA Authorization Act mandated the four now-retired space shuttles be gifted to cities with ties to their orbital missions. None were allocated to Houston in what Cornyn called a political stunt by the Obama administration.

Given the city’s central role in space exploration and coordinating each of the shuttle flights, Cornyn called Houston ""the cornerstone of our nation’s human space exploration program” and said it would right an “egregious wrong” to move the shuttle to Texas.

The senior Texas senator also secured an additional $10 billion in funding to support programs at the Houston space center and more money for the International Space Station and NASA’s Moon and Mars exploration program, known as Artemis.

The House approved the measure after the Senate significantly revised the original proposal. For a moment, the renewable energy industry was stunned by provisions that included a proposed tax on solar and wind power, along with an accelerated phase out of Biden-era tax credits.

Although the final version of the bill dropped the proposed tax, it also eliminated the electric vehicle tax credit established under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. It further shortened the window for renewable energy projects to qualify for solar and wind credits. Under the new rules, eligible projects must begin construction within a year of the bill’s passage and be placed in service by the end of 2027.

“I was proud to vote for the Inflation Reduction Act to help position Virginia as a leader in clean energy technology, putting us on a path toward 20,000 new jobs and lower energy costs,” Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said in a statement.

“…Why would President Trump and congressional Republicans undo such historic and effective legislation, and go even further to hurt clean energy by imposing new requirements many wind and solar projects won’t be able to meet?”

The tighter deadlines have raised alarms for projects still in the approval pipeline across several states. Appalachian Voices, an environmental advocacy group, said the bill could jeopardize local and community-led initiatives.

“If you start that project and you have an unexpected delay, but you’re still relying on the credits to get through the end of financing, then you’re just put in a really bad position,” said Kevin Zedack, government affairs specialist for Appalachian Voices. “Especially if you have that project currently moving, and already understand that it’s not going to be placed in service by the deadlines that were imposed. Then you’re just maybe a community organization or a church just left holding the bag.”

Zedack said the tax credits don’t just benefit large scale solar and wind farms for utilities, emphasizing that there have been a number of small community solar projects that were boosted by the credit.

For example, Lee County Public Schools implemented 1.4 megawatt panels across seven schools, along with job training programs. Appalachian Voices reports the school district saved over $3 million over the lifetime of the project.

Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., stated he is deeply disappointed by the roll backs of renewable energy incentives in the bill, especially after Virginia has made significant strides under the Virginia Clean Economy Act.

The fossil fuel industry, however, came out ahead in the bill. In the final Senate version, metallurgical mines are eligible for a 2.5% tax credit for production. While Virginia has steadily reduced coal production in recent years, there are still more than 100 active mines, mostly in the southwestern part of the state.

“A lot of most of the metallurgical coal that is produced in the United States comes from Appalachia, and most of that product is exported to other countries like India and China to produce cheaper steel,” Zedack said.

The bill passed the house with a margin of 218-214 with all Democrats and two Republicans voting against the measure.

,Clean Energy ,2025-07-04 10:07:32+00:00,Heatmap News,Where Clean Energy Goes From Here - Heatmap News,Matthew Zeitlin,,,,,https://heatmap.news/energy/obbba-clean-energy-future,"That’s the question people across the climate change and clean energy communities are asking themselves now that Congress has passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which would slash most of the tax credits and subsidies for clean energy established under the Inflation Reduction Act.
But clean energy development will hardly grind to a halt.
Shares in NextEra, which has one of the largest clean energy development businesses, have risen slightly this year and are down just 6% since the 2024 election.
Canceled clean energy investments adds up to $23 billion so far this year, compared to just $3 billion in all of 2024, according to the decarbonization think tank RMI.
“You can see a world where we have more action on clean energy tax credits to enhance, extend and expand them in a future congress,” Fishman told Heatmap.","What do we do now?

That’s the question people across the climate change and clean energy communities are asking themselves now that Congress has passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which would slash most of the tax credits and subsidies for clean energy established under the Inflation Reduction Act.

Preliminary data from Princeton University’s REPEAT Project (led by Heatmap contributor Jesse Jenkins) forecasts that said bill will have a dramatic effect on the deployment of clean energy in the U.S., including reducing new solar and wind capacity additions by almost over 40 gigawatts over the next five years, and by about 300 gigawatts over the next 10. That would be enough to power 150 of Meta’s largest planned data centers by 2035.

But clean energy development will hardly grind to a halt. While much of the bill’s implementation is in question, the bill as written allows for several more years of tax credit eligibility for wind and solar projects and another year to qualify for them by starting construction. Nuclear, geothermal, and batteries can claim tax credits into the 2030s.

Shares in NextEra, which has one of the largest clean energy development businesses, have risen slightly this year and are down just 6% since the 2024 election. Shares in First Solar, the American solar manufacturer, are up substantially Thursday from a day prior and are about flat for the year, which may be a sign of investors’ belief that buyer demand for solar panels will persist — or optimism that the OBBBA’s punishing foreign entity of concern requirements will drive developers into the company’s arms.

Partisan reversals are hardly new to climate policy. The first Trump administration gleefully pulled the rug from under the Obama administration’s power plant emissions rules, and the second has been thorough so far in its assault on Biden’s attempt to replace them, along with tailpipe emissions standards and mileage standards for vehicles, and of course, the IRA.

Even so, there are ways the U.S. can reduce the volatility for businesses that are caught in the undertow. “Over the past 10 to 20 years, climate advocates have focused very heavily on D.C. as the driver of climate action and, to a lesser extent, California as a back-stop,” Hannah Safford, who was director for transportation and resilience in the Biden White House and is now associate director of climate and environment at the Federation of American Scientists, told Heatmap. “Pursuing a top down approach — some of that has worked, a lot of it hasn’t.”

In today’s environment, especially, where recognition of the need for action on climate change is so politically one-sided, it “makes sense for subnational, non-regulatory forces and market forces to drive progress,” Safford said. As an example, she pointed to the fall in emissions from the power sector since the late 2000s, despite no power plant emissions rule ever actually being in force.

“That tells you something about the capacity to deliver progress on outcomes you want,” she said.

Still, industry groups worry that after the wild swing between the 2022 IRA and the 2025 OBBBA, the U.S. has done permanent damage to its reputation as a business-friendly environment. Since continued swings at the federal level may be inevitable, building back that trust and creating certainty is “about finding ballasts,” Harry Godfrey, the managing director for Advanced Energy United’s federal priorities team, told Heatmap.

The first ballast groups like AEU will be looking to shore up is state policy. “States have to step up and take a leadership role,” he said, particularly in the areas that were gutted by Trump’s tax bill — residential energy efficiency and electrification, transportation and electric vehicles, and transmission.

State support could come in the form of tax credits, but that’s not the only tool that would create more certainty for businesses — considering the budget cuts states will face as a result of Trump’s tax bill, it also might not be an option. But a lot can be accomplished through legislative action, executive action, regulatory reform, and utility ratemaking, Godfrey said. He cited new virtual power plant pilot programs in Virginia and Colorado, which will require further regulatory work to “to get that market right.”

A lot of work can be done within states, as well, to make their deployment of clean energy more efficient and faster. Tyler Norris, a fellow at Duke University's Nicholas School of the Environment, pointed to Texas’ “connect and manage” model for connecting renewables to the grid, which allows projects to come online much more quickly than in the rest of the country. That’s because the state’s electricity market, ERCOT, does a much more limited study of what grid upgrades are needed to connect a project to the grid, and is generally more tolerant of curtailing generation (i.e. not letting power get to the grid at certain times) than other markets.

“As Texas continues to outpace other markets in generator and load interconnections, even in the absence of renewable tax credits, it seems increasingly plausible that developers and policymakers may conclude that deeper reform is needed to the non-ERCOT electricity markets,” Norris told Heatmap in an email.

At the federal level, there’s still a chance for, yes, bipartisan permitting reform, which could accelerate the buildout of all kinds of energy projects by shortening their development timelines and helping bring down costs, Xan Fishman, senior managing director of the energy program at the Bipartisan Policy Center, told Heatmap. “Whether you care about energy and costs and affordability and reliability or you care about emissions, the next priority should be permitting reform,” he said.

And Godfrey hasn’t given up on tax credits as a viable tool at the federal level, either. “If you told me in mid-November what this bill would look like today, while I’d still be like, Ugh, that hurts, and that hurts, and that hurts, I would say I would have expected more rollbacks. I would have expected deeper cuts,” he told Heatmap. Ultimately, many of the Inflation Reduction Act’s tax credits will stick around in some form, although we’ve yet to see how hard the new foreign sourcing requirements will hit prospective projects.

While many observers ruefully predicted that the letter-writing moderate Republicans in the House and Senate would fold and support whatever their respective majorities came up with — which they did, with the sole exception of Pennsylvania Republican Brian Fitzpatrick — the bill also evolved over time with input from those in the GOP who are not openly hostile to the clean energy industry.

“You are already seeing people take real risk on the Republican side pushing for clean energy,” Safford said, pointing to Alaska Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski, who opposed the new excise tax on wind and solar added to the Senate bill, which earned her vote after it was removed.

Some damage has already been done, however. Canceled clean energy investments adds up to $23 billion so far this year, compared to just $3 billion in all of 2024, according to the decarbonization think tank RMI. And that’s before OBBBA hits Trump’s desk.

The start-and-stop nature of the Inflation Reduction Act may lead some companies, states, local government and nonprofits to become leery of engaging with a big federal government climate policy again.

“People are going to be nervous about it for sure,” Safford said. “The climate policy of the future has to be polycentric. Even if you have the political opportunity to make a big swing again, people will be pretty gun shy. You will need to pursue a polycentric approach.”

But to Godfrey, all the back and forth over the tax credits, plus the fact that Republicans stood up to defend them in the 11th hour, indicates that there is a broader bipartisan consensus emerging around using them as a tool for certain energy and domestic manufacturing goals. A future administration should think about refinements that will create more enduring policy but not set out in a totally new direction, he said.

Albert Gore, the executive director of the Zero Emissions Transportation Association, was similarly optimistic that tax credits or similar incentives could work again in the future — especially as more people gain experience with electric vehicles, batteries, and other advanced clean energy technologies in their daily lives. “The question is, how do you generate sufficient political will to implement that and defend it?” he told Heatmap. “And that depends on how big of an economic impact does it have, and what does it mean to the American people?”

Ultimately, Fishman said, the subsidy on-off switch is the risk that comes with doing major policy on a strictly partisan basis.

“There was a lot of value in these 10-year timelines [for tax credits in the IRA] in terms of business certainty, instead of one- or two- year extensions,” Fishman told Heatmap. “The downside that came with that is that it became affiliated with one party. It was seen as a partisan effort, and it took something that was bipartisan and put a partisan sheen on it.”

The fight for tax credits may also not be over yet. Before passage of the IRA, tax credits for wind and solar were often extended in a herky-jerky bipartisan fashion, where Democrats who supported clean energy in general and Republicans who supported it in their districts could team up to extend them.

China’s industrial policy has engineered a remarkable transformation to electric vehicles in what is the world’s largest auto market. In so doing, it has spawned far more makers than can possibly survive. Now, long-simmering concerns about oversupply and debilitating price wars are coming to the fore, even as the headline sales numbers soar to new heights.

Market-leader BYD announced this week that its sales grew 31% in the first six months of the year to 2.1 million cars. Nearly half of those were pure electric vehicles and the rest were plug-in hybrids, it said in a Hong Kong Stock Exchange filing. The company phased out internal combustion engine cars in 2022.

BYD came under thinly veiled criticism in late May when it launched a new round of price cuts, and several competitors followed suit. The chairman of Great Wall Motors warned the industry could come under threat if it continues on the same trajectory.

“When volumes get bigger, it’s just much harder to manage and you become the bullseye,” said Lei Xing, an independent analyst who follows the industry.

The government is trying to rein in what is called “involution” — a term initially applied to the rat race for young people in China and now to companies and industries engaged in meaningless competition that leads nowhere.

BYD has come under criticism for using its dominant position in ways that some consider unfair, sparking price wars that have caused losses across the industry, said Murthy Grandhi, an India-based financial risk analyst at GlobalData.

With the price war in its fourth year, Chinese automakers are looking abroad for profits. BYD’s overseas sales more than doubled to 464,000 units in the first half of this year. Worried governments in the U.S. and EU have imposed tariffs on made-in-China electric vehicles, saying that subsidies have given them an unfair advantage.

Market leader BYD comes under attack

The latest bout of handwringing started when BYD cut the price of more than 20 models on May 23.

The same day, the chairman of Great Wall Motors, Wei Jianjun, said he was pessimistic about what he called the “healthy development” of the EV market. He drew a comparison to Evergrande, the Chinese real estate giant whose collapse sent the entire industry into a downturn from which it has yet to recover.

“The Evergrande in the automobile industry already exists, but it is just yet to explode,” he said in a video message posted on social media.

Two days later, a BYD executive rejected any comparison to Evergrande and posted data-filled charts to buttress his case.

“To be honest, I am confused and angry and it’s ridiculous!” Li Yunfei, BYD’s general manager of brand and public relations, wrote on social media. “All these come from the shocking remarks made by Chairman Wei of Great Wall Motors.”

Next, the government and an industry association weighed in. The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers called for fair competition and healthy development of the industry, noting that major price cuts by one automaker had triggered a new price war panic.

On the same day, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology vowed to tackle involution-style competition in the auto industry, saying that recent disorderly price wars posed a treat to the healthy and sustainable development of the sector.

“That price cut might have been the final straw that irked both competitors and regulators for the ruthlessness that BYD continues to show,” Lei said.

A promise to pay suppliers within 60 days signals possible shift

The following month, 17 automakers including BYD made a pledge: They would pay their suppliers within 60 days.

One way China’s automakers have been surviving the bruising price wars is by delaying the payments for months. The agreement, if adhered to, would reduce financial pressure on suppliers and could rein in some of the fierce competition.

“The introduction of the 60-day payment pledge is the call of the government to oppose involution-style competition,” said Cui Dongshu, the secretary-general of the China Passenger Car Association.

It also reduces the risk of an Evergrande-like scenario.

Many automakers had stretched out payments by paying suppliers with short-term debt — promises to repay them in a certain period of time — instead of cash. Real estate developers used the same system. It worked until it didn’t. When Evergrande defaulted on its debts, suppliers were left holding worthless promises to pay.

“This practice is seen as a potential cause of a larger crisis, similar to what happened with Evergrande,” Grandhi said.

The vows to speed up payments and the government calls to rein in the price wars, along with a rollback of some financing offers, point to an effort to reverse downward price expectations, said Jing Yang, a director at Fitch Ratings who focuses on the auto industry.

“We may watch how effectively these measures are in reversing the price trend and how would that affect EV demand in the coming quarters,” she said.

Buyers have until Sept. 30 to qualify for the federal tax credits on EVs before they are terminated. But experts say there are still strong financial reasons to consider buying the vehicles even without those incentives.

Before the bill passed, new electric vehicles came with a $7,500 federal tax credit, and used EVs included up to $4,000. Those incentives were originally designed to help make the vehicles more affordable. According to the latest data from Kelley Blue Book, the average purchase price of a new EV is roughly $9,000 higher in the United States than the average new gas-powered car. Used EVs on average cost $2,000 more than comparable gas cars.

Those credits, paired with other incentives in many states, helped bridge that price gap. Without them, Senior Policy Director Ingrid Malmgren of the nonprofit advocacy group Plug In America said they will become unaffordable to many lower- and middle-income Americans.

“That’s really disappointing because … they’re just a really great way to reduce transportation energy cost burden,” Malmgren said.

The up-front cost of an electric vehicle might be higher, but for those who can afford to consider the lifetime fuel and maintenance savings, Malmgren said the EV is still a good financial and environmental move in every state.

EVs are typically still cheaper to own long-term

That is because electric vehicles might not be cheaper to buy, but they are cheaper to drive. Malmgren said that even without the federal tax credits, an electric vehicle owner would still come out ahead.

“Quickly you’ll end up paying less than a gas car because it costs much less to fuel, and it needs almost nothing for maintenance,” Malmgren said.

Malmgren said the point at which an EV driver’s savings on fuel and maintenance outweigh the higher initial price varies. It depends on the kind of car and how often they are driven, as well as the cost of gasoline and electricity in an area. She said EV owners pay less in upkeep because the cars typically have fewer moving parts to maintain and require less frequent servicing. There are multiplecalculators online that pinpoint that moment based on some of those criteria.

A 2020 study in the academic journal Joule found that the average EV in the U.S. charged with a typical mix of public and private chargers saves the driver $7,700 in fuel costs over a 15-year life span, compared to filling a car with gas. Savings vary by state. The study found that someone charging a car at home during off-peak hours, deemed as a best-case scenario, could save more than $14,000 over 15 years in Washington, where electricity is relatively affordable. The study said that an EV driver in any state exhibiting typical driving and charging behavior would save money on fuel costs. The study did not account for the car’s purchase price, its maintenance cost or associated tax credits.

EVs are still cleaner, even when they charge on coal power

Manufacturing an electric vehicle typically creates more pollution than making a traditional gas-powered one. But experts say that driving an EV over the long term is still less polluting than a gas car.

Once they both drive about 15,000 miles (24,000 km) — slightly more than the average American drives in a year — the total pollution that has gone into making and driving each type of car has evened out, said Peter Slowik, U.S. Passenger Vehicles Lead for the International Council on Clean Transportation. Every mile after that widens the gap between the cleaner electric car and the more pollutive gas car. By the end of the car’s life, emissions caused by the average EV are roughly half the average gas car, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

So unless you buy a new car each year, the EV is the cleaner choice, he said.

“They are a no-brainer,” Slowik said. “Electric vehicles are already inherently so much more efficient.”

A 2023 analysis by Yale Climate Connections found that electric vehicles are responsible for less carbon dioxide pollution even in areas where the electricity used to charge them comes from coal. An EV in West Virginia, which is one of the most coal-reliant states, still pollutes 31% less than an equivalent gas-powered car, according to the analysis.

Slowik said that is because electric cars are better at translating energy into forward motion. For example, the most popular EVs in the U.S., the Tesla Model Y and the Tesla Model 3, can drive more than 100 miles (161 km) on energy equivalent to what is provided by a gallon of gasoline.

“If you compare that to a 25-mpg gasoline vehicle, that’s already four to five times more efficient,” Slowik said.

""This could raise EV battery costs, as many rely on imported components, with prices potentially increasing by 10%-15%, according to clean energy experts.""","A landmark North Carolina manufacturing milestone has been achieved: the first shipments of hybrid electric vehicle battery modules from the mammoth Toyota Battery Manufacturing N.C. plant in Randolph County.

However, there is growing concern as to whether the battery plant will ever reach full production.

The first series of batteries are charging the electrified Toyota Corolla Cross vehicles being made in the Mazda Toyota Manufacturing plant in Huntsville, Ala., the company said last week.

In an interesting economic-development twist, the Liberty megasite was among the runners-up in consideration in 2017 for the Mazda-Toyota joint facility.

Next up in September will be similar HEV battery shipments to its Scott County, Ky., plant for its Camry sedan line. Toyota's entire line of Camrys became electrified with the 2025 edition.

The Liberty plant will feature 14 production lines at full production: 10 dedicated to battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, and four to hybrid electric vehicles.

""Our dedicated workforce (in Liberty), comprising nearly 2,000 team members, is excited to assemble batteries that will power future Toyota and Lexus hybrid-electric, plug-in hybrid electric and battery electric vehicles,"" Toyota Battery Manufacturing N.C. said in a statement.

The shipments come just more than 3½ years after Toyota Motor Co. committed in December 2021 to what has become the largest single economic-development project in North Carolina history at $13.9 billion, along with a projected 5,100 employees at full production.

Full production concerns

The Trump administration is targeting the end of federal tax credits worth up to $7,500 for purchasing an electric vehicle made in the U.S., as well as a $4,000 tax credit for a used EV purchase.

Those cuts became a reality Thursday when the Republican majority in the U.S. House approved the U.S. Senate version of President Donald Trump's ""Big Beautiful Bill"" that eliminates the tax credits as part of making permanent certain tax cuts for wealthy Americans and corporations.

A lower-priced 2025 EV model, such as a Nissan Leaf, sells for about $29,300. When factoring in the federal tax credit, the Leaf would cost about $21,800 for a discount of 25%.

Meanwhile, the federal tax credit would knock the sticker price for a $39,000 EV sedan, such as a Camry or Hyundai Ioniq 6, down by 20%.

The U.S. Senate version of the so-called ""Big Beautiful Bill"" would have the tax credit for new and used EV purchases expire Sept. 30, rather than the end of the year in the U.S. House version.

According to The Associated Press, the bill also cuts the provision that would have extended until the end of 2026 a credit for automakers that had not made 200,000 qualifying EVs for U.S. sale. Toyota has exceeded that production total.

All 10 House Republicans from North Carolina voted for the initial House version of the ""Big Beautiful Bill.""

The Toyota Battery Manufacturing NC plant represents 65% of the estimated $21.5 billion in clean-energy investment commitments in North Carolina since the passage of the Biden administration's 2022 federal Inflation Reduction Act, according to clean-energy advocacy group E2.com.

The bulk of the investment commitments at $19.5 billion have been made in U.S. House districts represented by Republicans, particularly U.S. Rep. Richard Hudson, R-9th, whose district includes the Toyota battery plant.

There have been at least 11,050 clean-energy job pledged in the 10 U.S. House districts represented by Republicans, or 86.7% of the 12,757 overall total.

North Carolina tops the nation in clean-energy capital investment commitments, as well as fifth for project commitments at 29.

For the U.S. Senate version of the controversial bill, Sen. Ted Budd voted in favor and Sen. Thom Tillis voted against.

Budd said in touting his vote for the bill that ""the people of North Carolina deserve more of their hard-earned wages, a more secure border, a reinvigorated military, responsible spending reforms for government programs, and a thriving economy.""

Budd did not mention ending the clean-energy tax credits in his statement.

He said that as part of ""unlocking economic growth and American manufacturing, this legislation will create a renaissance in American manufacturing by delivering full expensing for companies that build new factories and invest in equipment and machinery.""

Full expensing, according to TaxEDU.com, represents implementing a tax policy that allows businesses to deduct the full cost of their qualifying investments immediately in the year the expense is incurred.

The results are supposed to be increased productivity from workers who become more efficient when using newer equipment and technology, as well as higher worker wages and new jobs in manufacturing, construction and related industries.

""This will help create new, good-paying jobs,"" Budd said.

All in on EVs

Toyota announced in April 2024 that all 2025 versions of its top-selling Camry sedan would be hybrid vehicles.

Toyota Manufacturing North America reported in January it sold just more than 1 million Toyota and Lexus electrified vehicles in the U.S. during 2024, comprising 43.1% of 2.33 million vehicles sold.

On Wednesday, Toyota reported second-quarter U.S. electric vehicle sales of 320,817, up 29.7% year over year and representing 48.1% of total sales volume.

""Steady demand for our Toyota and Lexus brands resulted in strong sales throughout the second quarter,"" said Mark Templin, chief operating officer for Toyota Manufacturing North America. ""Our lineup of 32 electrified vehicles was a big part of that draw.""

Toyota's elevated commitment to EV production, compared with some of its top U.S. competitors, is viewed as a positive so far, according to economists.

""Toyota, relative to other EV carmakers, is in a much better position because it is not currently (as) reliant on consumer EV tax credits,"" said Zagros Madjd-Sadjadi, an economics professor at Winston-Salem State University.

Madjd-Sadjadi said the Liberty battery plant ""appears to be grandfathered in, and thus will still be eligible to receive the federal production tax credit and the federal investment tax credit — both being curtailed, but not eliminated, by the 'Big Beautiful Bill.'""

Madjd-Sadjadi said Toyota's U.S. production appears to be benefiting from the uncertainty of Trump administration tariffs.

""The roughly 8% decline in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the Japanese Yen since Jan. 20 (when President Donald Trump took office) is reducing costs for Toyota in the U.S. relative to producing in Japan,"" Madjd-Sadjadi said.

""That is good for Toyota's bottom line, at least with respect to battery manufacturing.""

Toyota, with major battery production operations in the Triad, ""is certainly not immune to the downstream effects of the 'Big Beautiful Bill' and its repealing and reducing of EV and Green incentives,"" said John H. Boyd, founder and principal with global site-selection firm The Boyd Co. of Boca Raton, Fla.

""But, it is much better positioned than other automakers with operations on U.S. soil to take this legislative pivot in stride.

Boyd said that Toyota’s ""more cautious clean energy moves have, in fact, led to its low ranking by Greenpeace compared to other automakers and their decarbonization programs.""

""Simply put, Toyota is a leader in hybrids, not pure EV’s, and that will insulate it somewhat from the economic fallout from the bill.""

Boyd also cited Toyota's local and state economic incentive packages ""provide Toyota with somewhat of cushion when the blll's rollback of clean energy incentives at the consumer and production level kick in.""

""Without these credits, production costs will likely rise, impacting pricing decisions for Toyota products, eating into profit margins and potentially cutting back on production and staffing at the Liberty plant.""

Making an appeal

A coalition of 28 automobile dealerships across the country, led by the national offices of CarMax and Carvana, sent a letter to the U.S. Senate on June 26 to urge caution on ending the federal EV tax credits.

""We urge you to reject the provisions in the budget reconciliation process that would increase costs for Americans who want to drive electric vehicles,"" the letter stated.

""For years, dealerships like ours have invested billions of dollars as small businesses to serve our communities, to improve EV education, and offer exceptional service. We need a stable and consistent market for our dealerships to plan, invest and grow.""

Letting the EV-related Inflation Reduction Act tax credits expire ""pose a serious threat to our business continuity and the industry’s long-term investments based on previous market signals and American leadership,"" the dealerships said.

""Collectively, changes on such a rapid timeline would introduce significant uncertainty and deter investment.""

Even though the tax credit focus on EVs has been on new purchases, the dealerships said used EV rebates ""in particular have provided a valuable bridge for working- and middle-class Americans.""

""Many of us have built substantial used EV businesses in markets with a lower cost of living, selling to customers who can then reduce their monthly household costs,"" the letter stated. ""For many of our working-class customers, the used EV rebate becomes the down payment that enables a vehicle purchase at all.""

If the Republican majorities in the U.S. House and Senate are determined to end the tax credits, the coalition said, ""a gradual sunset, rather than an abrupt repeal, is essential to serve the interests of American consumers, as well as car dealerships and the broader auto industry.""

""A slow phase-out would ensure market stability,"" it continued. ""A multi-year transitional period would also provide the opportunity for Americans to continue adopting cleaner vehicles more affordably.""

Hard to pivot

A project of the size and scale of the Toyota battery plant ""is difficult to pivot from the deeper a firm gets in the process,"" said John Quinterno, principal with South by North Strategies Ltd., a Chapel Hill research company specializing in economic and social policy.

""The EV-related provisions in the megabill arguably are very short-sighted. Transitioning to an entirely new infrastructure requires government support and policy, and Congress appears to be just walking away entirely from that and doubling down on traditional internal combustion vehicles at a time when the rest of the world is moving away from them. The American auto sector may find itself confined only to selling to a domestic market and losing out on the global stage.""

Global auto manufacturers, such as Toyota, ""likely will find themselves cross-pressured,"" Quinterno said.

""On the one hand, they likely see where the rest of the world is going and will want to compete in those markets. On the other hand, the U.S. still is a sizable market,"" he said. ""Such firms also are likely aware that maintaining operations in the U.S. is practical given the Trump administration's aggressive actions around trade and tariffs, even with traditional allies like Japan.

""They may choose to make their larger investments in more stable environments.""

Bob Keefe, E2's executive director, said after the U.S. Senate passage Tuesday of the bill that “America’s economy and energy security just took a massive step backward — one that may be hard to recover if not fixed immediately.""

“This bill will slam the brakes on made-in-America energy projects, push businesses to take their factories and investments overseas, and drive up energy costs for families and businesses,"" he said.

""It’s reckless, it’s shortsighted, and it hands our competitors like China an open invitation to lead while we fall behind,"" Keefe said. “President Trump wants to dramatically increase U.S. energy production. This bill does the opposite.”

Automobile trade publication EVXL projects that the loss of tax credits ""could strain EV supply chains, as manufacturers may scale back production to adjust to reduced demand.""

""The bill imposes restrictions on projects using materials from countries like China after 2027,"" the EVXL article stated. ""This could raise EV battery costs, as many rely on imported components, with prices potentially increasing by 10%-15%, according to clean energy experts.""

While domestic backlash has been swift, the bill is also raising concerns abroad, particularly over its potential to undermine international clean energy cooperation and climate commitments.","WASHINGTON, July 4 (Xinhua) -- In a narrow and deeply partisan vote, U.S. President Donald Trump's giant tax and spending plan, ""One Big, Beautiful Bill,"" rocketed past in the House on Thursday.

The bill, which cleared the House by a 218-214 vote after Vice President JD Vance broke a tie in the Senate on Tuesday, eliminates major clean energy incentives, including tax credits for electric vehicles and home energy efficiency upgrades.

While the Senate ultimately dropped a last-minute excise tax on wind and solar -- a measure experts had warned would have been a ""killer"" for the industry -- the final bill still delivers a major blow to renewable energy. Under the bill, key tax incentives for wind, solar and other clean energy projects will be phased out by 2027, with tighter conditions imposed for those seeking to claim them.

""It came as a complete shock,"" said Jason Grumet, chief executive of the American Clean Power Association, which represents renewable energy producers.

The new tax ""is so carelessly written and haphazardly drafted that the concern is it will create uncertainty and freeze the markets,"" Grumet was quoted by the New York Times as saying.

Grumet is among many industry analysts warning that the bill could deal a major blow to the U.S. clean energy transition, undermining investment confidence, stalling innovation and jeopardizing long-term job growth in the sector.

For example, the American Clean Power Association called the legislation a ""step backward for American energy policy,"" cautioning that it could eliminate jobs and drive up electricity costs.

According to projections from Energy Innovation and researchers at Wellesley College's Environmental Studies Department, the bill threatens 4,500 clean energy projects, puts hundreds of thousands of jobs at risk, and could add billions of dollars to Americans' annual energy bills within five years, Newsweek reported.

Meanwhile, electric vehicle makers also stand to lose. Before the bill's passage, new electric vehicles were eligible for a 7,500 U.S. dollar federal tax credit, while used EVs could qualify for a credit of up to 4,000 dollars. Those incentives were originally designed to help make the vehicles more affordable.

The bill runs counter to global green transition efforts, dealing a blow not only to America's clean energy sector but to global sustainability at large. While domestic backlash has been swift, the bill is also raising concerns abroad, particularly over its potential to undermine international clean energy cooperation and climate commitments.

""Emissions will increase significantly,"" said Robbie Orvis, senior director of modeling and analysis at the climate policy think tank Energy Innovation.

""There will be less clean energy deployed, replaced by a mix of gas and coal in the power sector,"" Orvis was quoted by Scientific American as saying on Thursday, which noted that the United States is the world's second-largest greenhouse gas emitter and the biggest historical contributor to climate change.

The broader implications of the bill have also sparked sharp criticism from environmental advocates.

""It's clear that this deeply unpopular bill favors burning more fossil fuels while ignoring the damage it will do to people's lives,"" said Joanna Slaney, vice president for political and government affairs for the Environmental Defense Fund.

As the House now sends the bill to Trump's desk, environmental groups are turning their attention to the next stage of the fight.

""We know that in the fight for clean air and clean water and a healthy environment that we can't afford to stop fighting,"" David Shadburn, legislative director at the League of Conservation Voters, told Inside Climate News. ""So we're going to keep doing that, and we know that the public is on our side."" ■",,N,,2025-07-04 06:05:22.316812

American electric vehicle makers Rivian and Lucid rose as much as 4.6% and 8.8%, respectively, on Thursday. The gains came after an analyst note from BNP Paribas said that the two companies stand to benefit from Trump's tax bill ending EV tax credits.

On Thursday, the House passed the final version of the bill, which would extend the president's 2017 tax cuts and make key changes to the tax system. The bill would also end the $7,500 EV tax credit awarded to buyers on September 30.

The tax credit removal is expected to lower demand for EVs, and bigger automakers could be hit harder.

Per the new bill, cars made by companies that sold more than 200,000 accepted EVs between December 31, 2009, and December 31, 2025, do not qualify for the tax credit.

Tesla delivered more than 336,000 vehicles in the first quarter of 2025 alone. Rivian delivered 8,000 vehicles in the same quarter, while Lucid delivered 3,109 vehicles.

Like Tesla, Rivian has been struggling with deliveries. Rivian's cars don't qualify for the tax credit, but the company has relied on a leasing loophole for customers to use it. Rivian does not qualify because a requirement mandates that a significant portion of the car battery's materials should be sourced from the US or its trade partners. Lucid vehicles qualify for the $7,500 federal EV tax credit.

Tesla and Lucid are down 22% and 28.5% so far this year. Rivian's stock is down 2% in the same time period.

Big hit to Tesla

The loss of the EV tax credit could be a big hit to Tesla, analysts say.

Last month, Seth Goldstein, an equity strategist at Morningstar, told Business Insider that the expedited elimination of the EV tax credit would be ""the biggest area that could impact Tesla.""

""Consumers have increased long-range EV choices at similar price points as Tesla,"" Goldstein said. ""It's on Tesla to make the case for consumers to even slightly pay up today versus some other EVs.""

Goldstein added that tax credit elimination could decrease sales volume, which the automaker has been struggling with.

JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote in a note last month that Trump's bill, combined with other proposed legislation, including ending the California Air Resources Board Program, threatened more than half of Tesla's 2025 profits.

Brinkman said that the $7,500 consumer tax made up 19% of Tesla's 2024 earnings before interest and tax.",https://i.insider.com/686754e185e81483682d6713?width=1200&format=jpeg,N,,2025-07-04 06:04:52.920454

The House approved the measure after the Senate significantly revised the original proposal. For a moment, the renewable energy industry was stunned by provisions that included a proposed tax on solar and wind power, along with an accelerated phase out of Biden-era tax credits.

Although the final version of the bill dropped the proposed tax, it also eliminated the electric vehicle tax credit established under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. It further shortened the window for renewable energy projects to qualify for solar and wind credits. Under the new rules, eligible projects must begin construction within a year of the bill’s passage and be placed in service by the end of 2027.

“I was proud to vote for the Inflation Reduction Act to help position Virginia as a leader in clean energy technology, putting us on a path toward 20,000 new jobs and lower energy costs,” Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said in a statement.

“…Why would President Trump and congressional Republicans undo such historic and effective legislation, and go even further to hurt clean energy by imposing new requirements many wind and solar projects won’t be able to meet?”

The tighter deadlines have raised alarms for projects still in the approval pipeline across several states. Appalachian Voices, an environmental advocacy group, said the bill could jeopardize local and community-led initiatives.

“If you start that project and you have an unexpected delay, but you’re still relying on the credits to get through the end of financing, then you’re just put in a really bad position,” said Kevin Zedack, government affairs specialist for Appalachian Voices. “Especially if you have that project currently moving, and already understand that it’s not going to be placed in service by the deadlines that were imposed. Then you’re just maybe a community organization or a church just left holding the bag.”

Zedack said the tax credits don’t just benefit large scale solar and wind farms for utilities, emphasizing that there have been a number of small community solar projects that were boosted by the credit.

For example, Lee County Public Schools implemented 1.4 megawatt panels across seven schools, along with job training programs. Appalachian Voices reports the school district saved over $3 million over the lifetime of the project.

Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., stated he is deeply disappointed by the roll backs of renewable energy incentives in the bill, especially after Virginia has made significant strides under the Virginia Clean Economy Act.

The fossil fuel industry, however, came out ahead in the bill. In the final Senate version, metallurgical mines are eligible for a 2.5% tax credit for production. While Virginia has steadily reduced coal production in recent years, there are still more than 100 active mines, mostly in the southwestern part of the state.

“A lot of most of the metallurgical coal that is produced in the United States comes from Appalachia, and most of that product is exported to other countries like India and China to produce cheaper steel,” Zedack said.

The bill passed the house with a margin of 218-214 with all Democrats and two Republicans voting against the measure.

Nazar added that the preservation of the tax credit transferability in the bill “reflects growing bipartisan recognition that this mechanism is essential to financing America’s energy future.
“But with the new federal deadlines for clean energy tax credits, states need to make their permitting and siting processes far faster, or many shovel-ready projects could miss their window to qualify.

Solar and wind projects will be required to begin construction within 12 months of the law’s enactment in order to retain its “commence construction” date as a safe harbour to receive the credits under 48E and 45Y. If not, projects starting construction after that 12-month period will need to be operational by the end of 2027 if it aims to be eligible for the credit.

If not, projects starting construction after that 12-month period will need to be operational by the end of 2027 to be eligible.

Regarding the foreign entities of concern (FEOC) materials, there have not been any significant changes from the Senate’s iteration covered earlier this week. FEOC restrictions will be enforced to limit the ability to avail of PTC and ITC incentives if material assistance from prohibited foreign entities exceeds certain thresholds, which will increase each year.

However, projects that start construction this year will not be affected by it, but will only come into force at the beginning of 2026.

Hasan Nazar, head of policy at clean energy tax transaction platform Crux, said that the rollbacks on tax credits for solar and wind will “no doubt have significant impacts on our partners and the clean energy sector”.

Nazar added that the preservation of the tax credit transferability in the bill “reflects growing bipartisan recognition that this mechanism is essential to financing America’s energy future. Transferability has proven to be a critical market-based mechanism for unlocking capital, speeding up deployment, and reducing reliance on more complex and costly financing structures.”

Industry’s resilience despite the impact on clean energy

Despite the impact of the bill on solar PV and clean energy as a whole, many reactions from trade associations were of resilience.

Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), said: “While this bill avoided some very damaging provisions, it is deeply disappointing to see partisan politics outweigh practical pro-growth solutions that serve all Americans. Solar and storage are America’s best bet to lower energy costs, build long-term energy resilience, and break free from the grip of foreign energy dependence. It is especially disheartening to witness the total disregard for the thousands of small businesses in the residential solar sector that were given only months to reinvent themselves.

“Regardless of what happens in Washington in the coming months and years, markets will continue to drive outcomes. The solar and storage industry is resilient, and SEIA will keep fighting every day for smart, stable, business-friendly policies that deliver on authentic and true American energy independence.”

Trade association, the Coalition for Community Solar Access (CCSA), called the House’s final passage of the reconciliation bill an “irrational and punitive choice”.

“Congress has put up irrational roadblocks—but our industry will not back down. This won’t be the first time we’ve overcome policy swings, and we’ll do it again. So long as the grid needs more power, customers demand it, and American competitiveness hinges on it—we will continue to build, innovate, and deliver low-cost distributed power to the grid,” said the CCSA statement.

Jason Grumet, CEO at American Clean Power Association (ACP), called the result of the bill a “dramatic swing in federal policy”, adding that clean energy will continue to play a significant role in the electricity mix of the US.

“While the new policies are a step backward, the combination of surging demand for electric power and economic benefits of renewable energy technologies ensure that clean power will continue to play a significant and growing role in our nation’s energy mix.

“America’s electricity demand is projected to surge by as much as 50% by 2040. That growth requires every available source of reliable power, including the clean energy technologies that are the only shovel-ready sources of additional power and the low-cost option across much of the nation.”

Ray Long, President and CEO of the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE), said: “Despite this setback, the clean energy industry remains committed to building the future. We’re already driving more than US$300 billion in private investment, delivering reliable power, and creating jobs in every region of the country. Stable tax policies would have allowed us to do even more.”

On the manufacturing side, the Solar Energy Manufacturers for America (SEMA) Coalition said the bill could close factories and destroy jobs in the manufacturing industry. An industry that has quickly built domestic supply chain, predominantly for modules and reached 50GW of annual nameplate capacity for modules back in February. A number that now sits at 56.5GW, according to SEIA’s latest data.

“Overall, this bill is short-sighted and fails to adequately support American energy innovation. By rapidly sunsetting demand incentives, Congress is pulling the rug out from under manufacturers, disrupting the reshoring process that is well underway, and conceding the market to China in one year, when the runway of the domestic content incentive ends,” said Mike Carr, executive director at the SEMA Coalition.

Call for faster permitting and siting process

With the clock ticking for solar PV projects to begin construction as quickly as possible in order to be eligible for the 45Y production tax credit (PTC) and 48E investment tax credit (ITC), calls have been made to regional transmission organisations (RTOs) and independent system operators (ISOs) to speed up the permitting and siting process.

Evan Vaughan, executive director at MAREC Action, a coalition of utility-scale solar, wind and energy storage developers in the Mid-Atlantic region, said: “Renewable energy projects in the PJM pipeline are ready to meet the Mid-Atlantic’s growing electricity demand — especially as AI and data centre development rapidly accelerate load across the region.

“But with the new federal deadlines for clean energy tax credits, states need to make their permitting and siting processes far faster, or many shovel-ready projects could miss their window to qualify. That would mean higher development costs, canceled projects, and ultimately, higher electric bills for consumers.

“Delays at the state level dictate whether consumers can access affordable, reliable clean energy. With so much private investment and grid reliability on the line, PJM states must act with urgency to clear a path to market.”",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/house-of-representatives.jpg,N,,2025-07-04 08:03:11.583972

North Carolina caps its taxes on hospitals and healthcare providers at 6%, while the federal package drops that to 3.5%.","With a final vote in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday, a sweeping tax bill that will touch almost every sector of the economy and overhaul industries like energy and health is headed to President Donald Trump's desk for a signature.

In North Carolina, Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, has publicly rallied against what Republicans have dubbed the ""One Big Beautiful Bill.""

Stein warned that it could threaten the healthcare of as many as 1.2 million North Carolinians; cause 1.4 million people in the state to lose food assistance unless the state can find $420 million to support the program; and cost 45,000 jobs by stymying the state's burgeoning clean tech manufacturing sector.

""The bill is a disgrace, and I am disappointed in those who did not stand up for the people they serve, choosing instead to ignore warnings from local leaders and groups across the state who have sounded the alarm about the dangers in this bill. We cannot simply accept these harmful impacts,"" Stein wrote in a statement after its passage.

Stein also called upon the Republican-controlled N.C. General Assembly to protect the state's Medicaid expansion,which ensures about 670,000 people. The program's future is imperiled by a state provision that effectively removes North Carolina it if the federal government stops covering 90% of the matching cost for the expansion population.

Additionally, Stein wants the General Assembly to provide about $420 million in funding that he says would now be necessary to keep North Carolina enrolled in the federal Supplement Nutrition Assistance Program.

""This will require taking a hard look at our laws, our state budget, and our long-term revenue requirements,"" Stein wrote.

Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., pointed to the Medicaid provision as a key reason for his opposition to the bill shortly before voting against it and announcing he would not seek reelection. Sen. Ted Budd, R-N.C., voted for the bill.

In a letter to the state's Congressional Delegation this week, Stein wrote that in addition to the Medicaid expansion population, as many as 520,000 additional North Carolinians could lose health insurance. Those people's coverage is threatened by changes to Medicaid, Marketplace health plans and subsidies, Stein wrote.

N.C. Department of Health and Human Services officials said Thursday they are reviewing the bill's final language to determine its full impact but warned the changes to Medicaid and food assistance will likely cost the state billions of dollars.

""These cuts not only impact the people that rely on them directly but also strain the systems and communities that hold us all together,"" DHHS Secretary Dev Sangvai said in a statement.

Congressional response

All 10 Republican members of the state's delegation in the U.S. House of Representatives voted for the bill, while all four Democrats voted against it.

Republicans touted passage of the bill, including U.S. Rep. Greg Murphy (R-N.C. 3), a practicing urologist who was known to be concerned about the Medicaid provisions in the package and how they would impact rural healthcare.

In a statement, the eastern North Carolina Republican touted tax cuts and additional spending on border security. He also referenced ""innumerable dynamic and spirited conversations"" with Trump Administration officials about rural health.

""This bill protects Medicaid benefits for those who are most vulnerable in our society, not able-bodied individuals capable of participating in the workforce, illegal immigrants, and those ineligible for benefits,"" Murphy wrote in a statement.

He also pointed to $50 billion to stabilize rural hospital systems as a key part of the package.

U.S, Rep. Mark Harris (R-N.C. 8) represents a district stretching from eastern Mecklenburg County to Robeson County. In a statement, Harris wrote that he is proud to uphold President Donald Trump's agenda, including completing the border wall and taking federal funding away from Planned Parenthood.

Harris also expressed concern, though, about the amount of new spending in the bill, which the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects will add more than $4 trillion to the United States' deficit.

""I recognize to undo the damage done to our country by radical progressive Democrats, Congress must authorize the funds to accomplish that goal. However, I fear that if Washington’s overspending addiction continues, the opportunity to put our country back on a path to a sound financial future is in jeopardy. In the coming months, Republicans must use every tool at our disposal to rein in government spending,"" Harris wrote.

U.S. Rep. Don Davis (D-N.C. 1), who represents an Eastern North Carolina district that is seen as the only competitive Congressional race in the state, expressed disappointment in the bill's passage Thursday afternoon.

""While I wholeheartedly support safeguarding the American people by strengthening our national defense and securing our border, it is also deeply concerning that the average hardworking family in eastern North Carolina will bear the brunt of H.R. 1’s out-of-touch spending, as the wealthiest individuals and Washington, D.C. insiders stand to benefit the most,"" Davis wrote in a statement.

Reaction from potential Senate candidates

U.S. Rep. Pat Harrigan (R-N.C. 10) celebrated defense spending and provisions making permanent the first Trump Administration's tax cuts. The bill keeps more than 500,000 taxpayers in the district from seeing a 27% tax hike, according to statistics Harrigan provided.

""It cuts taxes for working families, slashes wasteful spending, unleashes American energy and gives President Trump the resources to finish the job at the border. The One Big Beautiful Bill puts hardworking Americans first and allows North Carolina families to keep more of their hard-earned money,"" Harrigan wrote in a statement.

Since Tillis announced last weekend that he would not seek re-election, Harrigan has been touted as a potential candidate for the seat.

Another politician who has been considering running for the Senate seat is former Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat with decades of political experience in the state. In a statement posted to X, Cooper called the bill ""shameful.""

""Every day people are struggling to make ends meet with higher prices for food, rent and other bills. The bill just passed in DC not only doesn’t help them, it actually hurts working families, seniors, children and veterans so those at the top can have big tax breaks,"" Cooper wrote.

Wiley Nickel, a Democrat who served one term in Congress and is the only Democrat to have announced a Senate campaign, also slammed the bill and politicians who voted for it.

""Republicans in Congress have yet again caved to pressure from Trump, and in doing so, betrayed their promises to the American people. This bill is a Big Ugly Scam, and is nothing but a tax handout for billionaires that will balloon the deficit and rip health care away from millions,"" Nickel wrote.

Advocacy group reactions

The Food Bank of Central and Eastern North Carolina said it is ""outraged"" by the bill's passage.

Amy Berrios, the Food Bank's president and CEO, pointed to SNAP cuts but also to people who could lose Medicaid under the package. Those people, Berrios wrote, will now need to decide whether to pay for food, housing or medicine.

""We condemn this vote in the strongest possible terms. Our leaders should be finding ways to reduce hunger and put people on the path to self-sufficiency — not enacting cruel policies that push more local farms, businesses, and neighbors into desperation,"" Berrios said in a statement.

The N.C. Healthcare Association, which represents hospital systems across the state, released a statement before Thursday's vote saying that the $50 billion nationwide rural healthcare plan was an inadequate replacement for money that would be lost by capping taxes on healthcare providers and cutting Medicare's payment rates.

North Carolina caps its taxes on hospitals and healthcare providers at 6%, while the federal package drops that to 3.5%. The state uses money from those taxes to help meet federally mandated matches to receive Medicaid funding from the federal government that is sent on to hospitals. The hospitals use that money to help make up for the costs of providing service to the Medicaid population at lower rates.

Capping the tax would effectively wipe out that funding stream for hospitals, the Healthcare Association has warned. That could have significant consequences for safety net hospitals in rural communities.

After Thursday's vote, the Healthcare Association put out another statement saying, ""Now that H.R. 1 has passed, the North Carolina Healthcare Association will work closely with state lawmakers to find solutions that preserve access to care for North Carolinians and continue to engage with our members of Congress to ensure they understand the impact these cuts will have on our state’s Medicaid program.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b8f55dd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1011x531+6+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff8%2F6e%2Fa1b3b1c24283b11165bcd3898284%2F1024px-united-states-capitol-west-front.jpg,N,,2025-07-04 13:22:20.586768

""We condemn this vote in the strongest possible terms. Our leaders should be finding ways to reduce hunger and put people on the path to self-sufficiency — not enacting cruel policies that push more local farms, businesses, and neighbors into desperation,"" Berrios said in a statement.

The N.C. Healthcare Association, which represents hospital systems across the state, released a statement before Thursday's vote saying that the $50 billion nationwide rural healthcare plan was an inadequate replacement for money that would be lost by capping taxes on healthcare providers and cutting Medicare's payment rates.

North Carolina caps its taxes on hospitals and healthcare providers at 6%, while the federal package drops that to 3.5%. The state uses money from those taxes to help meet federally mandated matches to receive Medicaid funding from the federal government that is sent on to hospitals. The hospitals use that money to help make up for the costs of providing service to the Medicaid population at lower rates.

Capping the tax would effectively wipe out that funding stream for hospitals, the Healthcare Association has warned. That could have significant consequences for safety net hospitals in rural communities.

After Thursday's vote, the Healthcare Association put out another statement saying, ""Now that H.R. 1 has passed, the North Carolina Healthcare Association will work closely with state lawmakers to find solutions that preserve access to care for North Carolinians and continue to engage with our members of Congress to ensure they understand the impact these cuts will have on our state’s Medicaid program.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b8f55dd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1011x531+6+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff8%2F6e%2Fa1b3b1c24283b11165bcd3898284%2F1024px-united-states-capitol-west-front.jpg,N,,2025-07-04 06:05:38.200479

This change is particularly concerning for the clean energy industry, as tax incentives are crucial for controlling project costs.
This, in turn, could weaken the power grid and undermine the U.S.'s global competitiveness.
This disruption could also affect the U.S.'s position in the global technological race.
Many projects may rush to complete construction by 2027, but this could lead to a 20% reduction in clean energy projects over the next decade.","The passage of the ""Big and Beautiful Act"" by the U.S. Congress has sparked significant concerns within the American power industry. The law, which is set to take effect upon the signature of the U.S. President, includes provisions that could significantly impact the clean energy sector. Specifically, the act stipulates that all clean energy projects not commenced by the end of 2027 will lose their tax incentives, while those that begin construction by June 2026 will still be eligible for these benefits. This change is particularly concerning for the clean energy industry, as tax incentives are crucial for controlling project costs. The loss of this financial support could lead to a severe crisis within the sector.

The President of the U.S. Solar Energy Industries Association warned that the act could result in increased electricity prices, the closure of manufacturing plants, and the loss of thousands of construction jobs. This, in turn, could weaken the power grid and undermine the U.S.'s global competitiveness. The act's potential to disrupt the nation's energy future and hinder the development of industries critical to economic growth and national security is a significant concern. This disruption could also affect the U.S.'s position in the global technological race.

The act's impact on the clean energy sector is expected to be profound. Many projects may rush to complete construction by 2027, but this could lead to a 20% reduction in clean energy projects over the next decade. Given that renewable energy sources accounted for nearly 90% of the new electricity capacity added in the U.S. last year, this reduction could have far-reaching consequences. The overall new installed capacity in the U.S. could decrease by approximately 20%, leading to higher electricity costs.

The growing demand for data centers, driven by the artificial intelligence boom, is placing increasing strain on the U.S. power grid. This trend requires continuous expansion of the grid's capacity to support technological advancements. The International Energy Agency predicts that while U.S. electricity demand has remained relatively stable over the past few decades, it is expected to surge by 25% between 2023 and 2035, and by approximately 60% between 2023 and 2050. This increased demand, coupled with the potential reduction in clean energy projects, poses a significant challenge.

The Chief Executive of NextEra Energy, a major utility and power developer, noted that even natural gas power generation may not be sufficient to meet the growing demand from data centers. Despite record-breaking domestic shale gas production, the cost of converting natural gas into electricity is rising, and supply chain challenges are limiting production. This situation underscores the need for the U.S. to invest in new power generation facilities, considering all available technologies, including nuclear, natural gas, wind, and solar power.",,N,,2025-07-04 11:08:23.399594
,North Carolina and Evs,2025-07-04 09:03:18+00:00,Compound Semiconductor,Wolfspeed: Rejuvenated by restructuring? - Compound Semiconductor News,Not Available,,,,,https://compoundsemiconductor.net/article/122064/Wolfspeed_Rejuvenated_by_restructuring,"Wolfspeed, and in its former guise Cree, has been at the very forefront of our industry for decades.
But Wolfspeed has just announced a deal struck with Renesas, which in July 2023 loaned Wolfspeed $2 billion and agreed to a 10-year wafer supply contract.
Note that this astonishing growth has been far from linear, with Wolfspeed’s sales of SiC power devices flat-lining from 2023 to 2024.
Here, Chiu argues that Wolfspeed is competitive, with a 10 percent share of the SiC power electronics market.
But while few will worry that Wolfspeed will survive, it’s certainly going to be hard to see it thrive in the foreseeable future.","Wolfspeed, and in its former guise Cree, has been at the very forefront of our industry for decades. Building on its initial expertise in SiC, this spin-out of North Carolina State University that founded in the late 1980s has been a trailblazer of SiC substrates, along with high-brightness LEDs and power and RF electronics.

In recent times, driven by the vision of Wolfspeed’s former CEO, Gregg Lowe, the company has streamlined its business, first carving out its LED division and then selling its RF business to Macom in December 2023.

While these moves that have shifted the focus to SiC substrates, epiwafers and power devices make much sense, given that the current portfolio is aligned with an electric vehicle market that is sure to climb over the coming years, it’s not prevented Wolfspeed from finding itself trapped in a particularly ferocious perfect storm. Peril has resulted from borrowing big to try and fully exploit growth in softening SiC markets, while facing increasingly stiff competition from Chinese makers of SiC substrates that are slashing prices to win sales in a sector suffering from overcapacity.

Now Wolfspeed is trying to extricate itself from this precarious position by starting to convert billion-dollar cash injections from BorgWarner, ZF and Renesas into shares, filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in late June, and trimming its wage bill by laying of a 20 percent of its workforce.

But will this be enough? And even if Wolfspeed soldiers on, has it already been inflicted with irreparable damage?

Offering insight into all this and more, including crucial details into why Wolfspeed has got itself into such dire straits, is Yole Group’s Principal Technology & Market Analyst for Compound Semiconductors, Poshun Chiu, who has been sharing his thoughts with Compound Semiconductor.

According to Chiu, Wolfspeed’s problems have been exacerbated by its incredibly aggressive investment in capacity expansion, spurred on by an outlook based on design-ins rather than design wins, and optimistic forecasts. “They targeted a larger market size, much higher than Yole's numbers at the time.”

Driven by these enthusiastic predictions, Wolfspeed has been spent billions and billions expanding its capacity. In North Carolina, home of its materials and epiwafer businesses, Wolfspeed’s recently complemented a well-established facility with the John Palmour Manufacturing Center. Topped out last March, this latter addition, designed for the production 200 mm SiC wafers, cost $5 billion.

Some device production also occurs in North Carolina, using 6-inch material, but this is being phased out. “In the coming quarters they want to have 100 percent device manufacturing in Mohawk Valley,” says Chiu, explaining that the plan has been to add tools to this facility – opened in 2022 as the world’s first 200 mm SiC fab – over a number of years.

Underscoring how fast Wolfspeed intended to grow its business, the company also planned to build a second 200 mm fab in Mohawk Valley, plus another in Germany, with financial support from ZF.

It’s not yet clear exactly how ZF and another financial backer, BorgWarner, will recoup their substantial investments. But Wolfspeed has just announced a deal struck with Renesas, which in July 2023 loaned Wolfspeed $2 billion and agreed to a 10-year wafer supply contract. Now that loan has been converted into Wolfspeed shares, maturing in June 2031. Chiu expects similar outcomes for ZF and BorgWarner, given the lack of alternative options.

From substrates to devices

Within Wolfspeed’s current portfolio of SiC substrates, epiwafers and devices, over the last few years emphasis has shifted to the production of power electronics. Yole Group estimates that back in 2020, sales of SiC power devices netted around $100 million – about a fifth of the company’s revenue – and by 2024 this figure had climbed to nearly $400 million, positioning Wolfspeed as the fourth biggest supplier of this class of device. Note that this astonishing growth has been far from linear, with Wolfspeed’s sales of SiC power devices flat-lining from 2023 to 2024.

The company’s growth in SiC power devices over the last five years is crucial to its long-term prospects, given that Wolfspeed’s stranglehold on the substrate market is loosening fast. As well as using substrates for internal production, the company has been selling to many of the leading producers of power electronics for decades, but its share of this market is in decline, and is now less than 30 percent, comparing to around 50 percent in 2021, according to Yole Group

Behind Wolfspeed are few Chinese companies. One is SICC, now in second spot, followed by TanKeBlue and other Chinese peers. Taken together, they have grown their market share from 10 percent in 2021 to nearly 40 percent, according to Yole Group.

“The Chinese companies have improved quality a lot, and the price compared to the international players is much lower,” says Chiu, explaining the additional capacity provided by Chinese SiC substrates makers contributed to overcapacity in 2024, and a price drop of 30 percent.

Chiu says that the Chinese companies are striving to win market share by compromising the gross margin. Some new entrants are even selling the substrate at the price below cost. Despite this aggressive approach, prices are not expected to fall as fast in the near future – Chiu is expecting reductions of around roughly 10 percent per annum – because all the players in the SiC market are currently managing cash very carefully.

In Wolfspeed’s favour is the high quality of its substrates, particularly valued for producing MOSFETs for the automotive industry. The quality of Chinese material was not as high, arguably making it better-suited for less demanding Schottky barrier diode production. However, the quality of substrates from Chinese players is getting better and better, spurred on by competition between Chinese suppliers, and the diameter of these wafes is getting larger. In 2025, at Semicon China, many domestic producers of SiC boules demonstrated 300 mm wafers. This size could unlock an opportunity to use SiC as the backplane in AR glasses, an application that promises to drive volumes to new highs.

What will also concern Wolfspeed is that the SICC and TanKeBlue have been qualified by market leaders of SiC device, such as Infineon and Bosch. Given the uncertainty surrounding the future of Wolfspeed, there is more importance than ever for chipmakers to mitigate risk by securing multiple suppliers – but once multiple vendors are qualified, all suppliers will have to compete for sales.

As a device manufacturer, Wolfspeed is focusing on the most demanding application, electric vehicles, and supplying MOSFETs for use in inverters. Here, Chiu argues that Wolfspeed is competitive, with a 10 percent share of the SiC power electronics market.

“What Wolfspeed has achieved is quite significant, but it's not enough to sustain or support their ambitions, like to build a huge fab in the US, and another fab in Germany,” says Chiu. “They have achieved a certain level of revenue, but somehow it's not sufficient compared to the level of investment announced.”

Those now in charge of Wolfspeed will be hoping to retain existing customers and find new ones, while restructuring capital to ensure a cash flow that provides a sustainable business.

In Wolfspeed’s favour is that when it comes to chip manufacture it’s still the market leader for device production on a 200 mm line. Thanks to this edge over its rivals, Chiu believes that if Wolfspeed can get navigate through these difficult times, it could grow its revenue, or at least its shipments, over the next few years.

While such success would be very modest when judged against the big and bold plans of yesteryear, it might help to start to nudge the share price in the right direction. Shares have tumbled from over $140 in late 2021 to trade at times below a dollar, reflecting the severe downturn in fortunes, although the recent chapter 11 filing went down well with markets, helping to deliver some significant hikes in valuation. But while few will worry that Wolfspeed will survive, it’s certainly going to be hard to see it thrive in the foreseeable future.",https://f001.backblazeb2.com/file/BIT-Magazine-Images/1751620182-Wolfspeed.jpeg,N,,2025-07-04 07:10:25.614497

FEOC Definitions

Prohibited Foreign Entity (PFE). Includes both SFEs and FIEs.

Determination made as of last day of taxable year, except for first taxable year after enactment, determination made as of first day of such taxable year (i.e., Jan. 1, 2026) as it relates to certain discrete criteria

SFE. An entity that:

meets the definition as provided in Section 9901(6) of the William Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for fiscal year (FY) 2021:

designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. Secretary of State under Section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1189)

included on the list of specially designated nationals and blocked persons maintained by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)

alleged by the U.S. Attorney General to have been involved in activities for which a conviction was obtained

is identified as Chinese military company

is included on a list as a result of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act

is specified under Section 154(b) under the NDAA of FY 2024 (specifically, the entities listed in paragraphs 1-7 on page 47 of L. 118-31)

is a ""foreign controlled entity"" (the government of a covered nation, an agency or instrumentality, a person who is a citizen or national of a covered nation, an entity or business unit incorporated or organized or having its principal place of business in a covered nation, or any entity ""controlled"" by those described in this parenthetical) (where ""control"" = 50 percent vote or value of stock of corporation or 50 percent capital interest or beneficial interests)

FIE. An entity whereby:

an SFE has direct authority to appoint a covered officer (where ""covered officer"" = board of director, supervisor or equivalent, or executive officer or equivalent)*

a single SFE owns at least 25 percent of such entity*

one or more SFEs owns, in aggregate, 40 percent or more of such entity*

at least 15 percent of the debt is issued to aggregate by one or more SFEs*

(*exception for certain publicly traded companies)

During the previous taxable year, the entity (or related person) made a payment to an SFE pursuant to a contract, agreement or other arrangement under which the SFE (or related person) has effective control (referred to as the ""payment rule"").

Effective control generally means authority over key aspects of production of eligible components, energy generation or energy storage that are not included in measures of control through authority, ownership or debt.

With respect to a licensing agreement, this includes when such agreement allows an SFE to source items (components, subcomponents, critical minerals), direct the operation, utilize intellectual property, or receive royalties or any license agreement entered into or modified after enactment. Only exception is for bona fide purchase of intellectual property.

Material Assistance to a Prohibited Foreign Entity. This requires consideration of ""material assistance cost ratio"" to determine if less than applicable ""threshold percentage.""

Threshold percentages vary by year and technology but increase over time.

For Section 45Y and Section 48E, the ratio looks to total direct costs to the taxpayer for all manufactured products (including components) that are mined, produced or manufactured by a PFE.

For Section 45X, the ratio looks to the total direct materials costs for the production of the eligible component that are attributable to a PFE. This test includes constituent materials and subcomponents.

Certain safe harbor tables (pulled from Notice 2025-08) are available for material assistance cost ratio until further guidance is issued but do not apply to Section 45X as currently drafted.

Certain costs can be excluded from the material assistance cost ratio if the existing contract exception applies. Exception requires, inter alia, that the taxpayer had a binding written contract prior to June 16, 2025.

There is a six-year statute of limitations on material assistance and increased tax penalties on taxpayer and suppliers making certifications.

U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit) called the bill “an act of violence against our communities,” marking the largest cut to Medicaid in history.
As states navigate how to continue health care coverage for millions of residents, Michigan hospitals may have to eliminate service lines or close down entire facilities, Peters said.","Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday mustered a mostly party-line 218-214 vote to approve President Donald Trump’s signature federal tax and spending bill, which will head to his desk for a signature on Friday, July 4.

The bill’s passage marked a major victory for U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) and U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-South Dakota) after weeks of dissension and some initial defections. The bill includes a wide swath of tax and spending cuts that some have warned would kick millions off Medicaid and force states to take up the bulk of costs on key social programs.

While Democrats in Michigan castigated the bill’s passage as doing real harm to the most vulnerable, GOP members of Congress cheered the action, saying it delivers on Trump’s various campaign promises.

Each member of Michigan’s Republican congressional delegation voted in favor of the bill, including U.S. Rep. John James of Shelby Township, who has previously declared his intention to seek the Michigan GOP nomination for governor in 2026.

“We’re cutting taxes on tips and overtime, protecting Social Security, rebuilding American manufacturing, and putting an end to handouts for illegal immigrants and able-bodied adults who won’t work,” James wrote in a statement shared on X. “This bill secures our border, strengthens our economy, and keeps our word to the American people.”

U.S. Rep. Lisa McClain (R-Bruce Township), the House Republican Caucus chairwoman, told ABC News that “people in my district” wanted Medicaid dollars only going to the most vulnerable, and not undocumented immigrants or others that Republicans have deemed ineligible to receive those funds with new work requirements.

“We know that Medicaid isn’t exactly on solid ground, so we really need to make sure that when we put a dollar into that Medicaid program, that it is going to the most vulnerable,” McClain said. “That’s what Republicans have done. They have shored up Medicaid, making sure that the most vulnerable get those benefits that they deserve, and that they get them for the future to come.”

She called Democratic Party efforts to stall, upend or warn people about the consequences of the bill “fear mongering” and equated it to gaslighting the American people.

U.S. Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Zeeland), who is a potential candidate for the U.S. Senate in Michigan, posted on X that he was attending the enrollment session for the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” with Johnson, noting that it would be sent to Trump to sign on Friday.

Huizenga called the process “a long, but very important journey for the future of America.”

U.S. Rep. Tim Walberg (R-Tipton) said in a statement released by the U.S. House Education & Workforce Committee, of which Walberg chairs, that Congress took decisive action to bring cost downs for Americans – a claim that will be watched closely by critics of the bill.

“This bill puts forward the first set of significant conservative reforms to the higher education landscape in two decades,” Walberg said. “And thanks to the Committee and House Republicans’ initiative and hard work, the One Big Beautiful Bill will help maintain America’s world-class higher education system.”

U.S. Rep. Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte) in a statement said he believed the bill would “prevent the largest tax hike in American history, lower energy costs, and permanently secure our border – all while protecting the integrity of Medicaid and SNAP for those who need them most.”

“This legislation will create thousands of good-paying jobs to boost our economy, ensure the middle class keeps more money in their pockets, and invest in a brighter future for America,” Barrett said. “It also delivers on promises made to hardworking families and businesses in Michigan: no tax on tips or overtime, permanent tax relief, an expanded Child Tax Credit, and more.”

Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) called the budget bill “one more huge win for Michigan thanks to President Trump.”

“Under this plan, working families will get to keep more of their paychecks,” Hall said in a statement. “Our border will be far more secure and criminal illegal aliens will be removed from our communities. The American military will be even stronger. And taxpayers will finally see better value for their dollars as wasteful programs and fraud are cut out of the budget. This is exactly what Americans voted for, and this is what Michigan needs to be successful.”

Democrats decry bill’s passage as a ‘fail’ for Michigan

Meanwhile, Michigan Democrats sharply criticized the bill, calling out its impacts on vital programs like Medicaid and food assistance while noting the plan largely benefits the richest in our country.

U.S. Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet (D-Bay City) reiterated her “no” vote in a statement, saying the bill would make life more expensive for Michigan residents, who are already facing high costs.

“Working families will lose their health care, children will go hungry, and our seniors will lose access to long-term care, all to pay for massive tax breaks for the ultra-wealthy. Everybody will see daily costs go up like health care, utility bills, and food to help Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos make more money,” McDonald Rivet said.

U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit) called the bill “an act of violence against our communities,” marking the largest cut to Medicaid in history.

“Republicans should be ashamed of themselves for saying the people losing their health care will just ‘get over it’ because ‘we’re all going to die.’ They are responsible for the over 50,000 people who will die unnecessarily every year because of this deadly budget,” Tlaib said.

U.S. Rep. Shri Thanedar (D-Detroit) highlighted how the bill’s cuts to Medicaid and SNAP would harm his constituents, calling it a betrayal of the working class.

“My district has the fourth highest SNAP participation rate in the country at 29%, and 47% of our district relies on Medicaid to get the healthcare they need to survive. My decision to vote no on this bill was the easiest I’ve had as an elected official, as these cuts will deeply harm every single person in my congressional district,” Thanedar said.

In addition to raising concerns on the bill’s impacts on healthcare and food assistance, U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham) noted the package would eliminate investments into manufacturing and place rural hospitals at risk of closure as a result of its cuts to medicaid.

“This bill will benefit the millionaires and billionaires like Donald Trump at the expense of Michiganders. I will continue to stand up to this Administration every single day, until we finally see a deal that works for Michigan and the people I care so deeply about,” Stevens pledged.

U.S. Rep. Hillary Scholten (D-Grand Rapids), similarly committed to working for her constituents, after citing the 218-214 margin on which the bill passed as evidence that it will have disastrous consequences.

“Our work is not over. Today is a disappointing day for our nation, but we will continue to work towards the future that West Michigan deserves,” Scholten said in a social media post.

Also in a social media post, U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Ann Arbor) called the bill one of the most consequential, devastating, dangerous bills Congress had passed in recent history, questioning why anyone would vote in support of the policy.

“This bill is a complete and total failure. The American people overwhelmingly disagree with it, and will not forget those who chose to vote for this cruelty,” she said.

Curtis Hertel Jr., chair of the Michigan Democratic Party, slammed Republican members of the state’s congressional delegation for their support of the bill, honing his criticism on members sitting in vulnerable Congressional districts.

“Congressmen James, Barrett, and Huizenga are betraying the very Michiganders they promised to serve when they chose Donald Trump’s reckless agenda over parents with cancer and hungry children,” Hertel said, noting “Michiganders will not forget what they’ve done when November comes.”

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee similarly honed its criticism on Barrett and Huizenga, with Chair Suzan DelBene calling their support for the bill “the latest and loudest declaration of the fact that they will always prioritize serving Republicans’ billionaire campaign donors at the expense of the children, families, and workers they’re supposed to represent.”

“The DCCC will make sure every battleground voter knows how vulnerable House Republicans — including Barrett and Huizenga — abandoned them by passing the most unpopular piece of legislation in modern American history, and we’re going to take back the House majority because of it,” DelBene said.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer lambasted James, Barrett and Huizenga, while applauding her Democratic colleagues for opposing the bill.

“I stand with them and remain committed to doing everything in my power to defend Michiganders. It’s time to stop playing politics with people’s lives and get to work on real, commonsense solutions that improve people’s lives.”

With James running as one of the Republican hopefuls in Michigan’s 2026 gubernatorial election, the Democratic Governors Association laid into the representative as a key vote on the tax and spending bill.

The DGA similarly criticized former Michigan House Speaker Tom Leonard for his support of the plan, while calling on Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt (R-Porter Township) and Former Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox – other high profile Republicans seeking the governorship – to “be clear about whether they, like their competitors, support taking away Michiganders’ health care all to pay for big tax cuts for the wealthy.”

Groups continue to ring alarms over Medicaid cuts

Various political advocacy groups also sounded off in statements released Thursday, mostly calling out the bill and those who voted for it.

“We will not forget when you put the pocketbooks of billionaires and your own greedy political ambitions above the health of your people,” said Monique Stanton, CEO of the Michigan League of Public Policy. “And when health clinics and hospitals close and the stories of loss begin to spread, these same lawmakers will try to place blame on the states. When Michiganders lose their lifesaving coverage over unnecessary additional bureaucratic hurdles, these same lawmakers will claim they are preventing fraud, waste and abuse, of which there is no evidence.”

The result of cutting Medicaid funds could be devastating to Michigan’s health care infrastructure, costing Michigan hospitals more than $6 billion over the next decade as facilities attempt to maintain the same level of care, said Brian Peters, CEO of the Michigan Health & Hospital Association, in a statement.

About 70% of Medicaid, for which 1 in 4 Michiganders is a recipient, is federally funded while the state funds the other 30%. As states navigate how to continue health care coverage for millions of residents, Michigan hospitals may have to eliminate service lines or close down entire facilities, Peters said.

“This bill is an attack on Medicaid, expanded health insurance coverage and healthcare access. We are extremely disappointed with the actions taken by Congress. Today is an extremely large step backwards for making and keeping our communities healthier,” Peters said.

The bill’s one-year ban on state Medicaid funds for certain health care nonprofits that provide abortions could force Planned Parenthood to shut down nearly 200 health centers across the country, eliminating another sector of Michigan’s public health care system Ashlea Phenicie, chief external affairs officer of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Michigan said in a statement earlier this week.

The bill aims to effectively shutdown Planned Parenthood health clinics and impose an abortion ban even in states like Michigan where abortion rights are law, Phenicie said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/mikejohnsonjulyshutt-2048x1536.jpg,N,,2025-07-04 13:23:10.134602

“America needs all the power it can get, but Washington chose to compound our national energy crisis,” said Oceantic president and CEO Liz Burdock.

“The Reconciliation Bill ultimately weakens our nation’s ability to compete in the global AI race and drives up costs for ratepayers.”

Under the final language, offshore wind developers must begin construction by mid-2026 or complete it by end-2027 to retain full eligibility for Inflation Reduction Act tax credits — a significant scaling back from previous timelines. Oceantic noted that the bill also improves foreign-entity supply chain rules and removes a proposed excise tax.

Industry supporters say the extended tax credits will allow utilities and operators to make long-term investments in modernisation, helping meet national clean energy and reliability goals.","The US Senate has passed the sweeping reconciliation package known as the “One Big, Beautiful Bill”, with significant implications for the country’s energy sector. The bill extends federal tax credits for hydropower and other baseload energy sources, while scaling back support for wind and solar projects.

The legislation, passed by a 51–50 vote with Vice President J.D. Vance casting the tie-breaker, alters the clean energy credit structure established in earlier climate legislation. Under the new framework, tax incentives for hydropower, nuclear, geothermal, and energy storage will remain in place until 2033, with a gradual phaseout through 2036. In contrast, wind and solar tax credits are set to begin phasing out in 2028.

In response to the bill’s passage, National Hydropower Association (NHA) President and CEO Malcolm Woolf issued a statement praising the Senate’s action.

“The Senate passed ‘One Big, Beautiful Bill’ recognizes the essential role hydropower plays in delivering around-the-clock, baseload electricity that keeps the grid reliable, clean, and affordable,” Woolf said.

“With approximately 40% of the existing U.S. hydropower fleet facing license expiration, federal tax credits are critical toward repowering the existing fleet while also enabling new hydropower development at existing dam sites, new pumped storage, and Marine Energy,” he continued. “We thank our many Senate champions for fighting to preserve and expand the nation’s hydropower fleet, which provides electricity to roughly 25 million American homes and businesses every day.”

The hydropower sector is currently facing a major challenge as a large portion of the U.S. fleet approaches license renewal. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) requires facilities to undergo rigorous environmental and technical reviews during relicensing, which often includes new requirements such as fish passage upgrades, modernized turbines, and dam safety improvements. These investments can be costly, and without federal support, many operators may be forced to retire their facilities rather than reinvest.

In the past decade, more than 60 hydropower operators have surrendered their licenses, citing economic infeasibility. Industry leaders argue that targeted tax incentives are essential to maintain the existing fleet and support additional development at non-powered dams and through new technologies such as marine and pumped storage hydropower.

The reconciliation bill’s passage follows months of negotiation, with Republican lawmakers seeking to narrow the scope of clean energy subsidies while prioritizing baseload and dispatchable sources. Hydropower advocates have long argued that their sector, which provides consistent generation regardless of weather conditions, should receive equal treatment with nuclear and fossil fuel plants.

Hydropower currently provides about 6 to 7% of US electricity but plays an outsized role in grid stability due to its reliability and flexibility.

BANGKOK (Reuters) -Hyper-competition in China’s electric vehicle sector is spilling over to its biggest market in Asia, Thailand, as smaller players struggle to compete with dominant BYD, putting ambitious local production plans at risk.

Neta, among the earliest Chinese EV brands to enter Thailand in 2022, is an example of a struggling automaker finding it difficult to meet the requirements of a demanding government incentive programme meant to boost Thai EV production.

Under the scheme, carmakers are exempt from import duties, but were obligated to match import volumes with domestic production in 2024.

Citing slowing sales and tightening credit conditions, carmakers asked the government to adjust the scheme and the 2024 production shortfall was rolled over into this year.

Neta has said that it cannot produce the required number of cars locally and the government has withheld some payments to the EV maker, said Excise Department official Panupong Sriket, who received a complaint filed last month by 18 Neta dealers in Thailand seeking to recover over 200 million baht ($6.17 million) of allegedly unpaid debt.

The complaint, a copy of which was reviewed by Reuters, also detailed missed payments by Neta related to promised support for building showrooms and after-sales service.

“I stopped ordering more cars in September because I sensed something was wrong,” said Neta dealership owner Saravut Khunpitiluck. “I’m currently suing them.”

Neta’s parent company, Zhejiang Hozon New Energy Automobile, entered bankruptcy proceedings in China last month, according to state media.

Neta and its Chinese parent did not respond to Reuters’ requests for comment.

MARKET SHARE DECLINE

Neta’s share of Thailand’s EV market peaked at around 12% of EV sales in 2023 when the industry was growing, according to Counterpoint Research data, with BYD having a 49% share that year.

In Thailand, a regional auto production and export hub, Chinese brands dominate the EV market with a combined share of more than 70%.

The number of Chinese EV brands has doubled in the last year to 18, placing pressure on those that lack the reach of BYD, which has taken over from Tesla as the world’s biggest EV maker.

In the first five months of this year, new registration of Neta cars – a proxy for sales – slumped 48.5% from the prior year and its share of EV registrations was down to 4%, according to government data.

“Neta’s downturn in Thailand reflects the fragility of second-tier Chinese EV brands both at home and abroad,” said Abhik Mukherjee, an automotive analyst at Counterpoint Research.

“Intense price competition and the scale advantages of dominant players have made survival increasingly difficult for smaller companies, particularly in export markets, where margins are slim and robust after-sales support is essential.”

In Thailand, Neta’s biggest international market, it sells three models, with the cheapest Neta V-II Lite priced at 549,000 baht ($16,924) before discounts, compared to market leader BYD’s entry-level Dolphin model that is priced at 569,900 baht.

Thailand’s domestic auto market has become increasingly competitive amid a sluggish economy.

“Some Chinese brands have slashed prices by more than 20%,” said Rujipun Assarut, assistant managing director of KResearch, a unit of Thai lender Kasikornbank.

“Pricing has become the main strategy to stimulate buying.”

China’s EV overcapacity and price war have pushed automakers to expand abroad, but markets like Thailand are now mirroring the same hyper-competitive pressures, exposing smaller firms to similar risks.

‘NO CONFIDENCE’

Three years ago, Thailand unveiled an ambitious plan to transform its car industry, long dominated by Japanese majors like Toyota and Honda, to ensure at least 30% of its total auto production was EVs by 2030.

The country, which exports about half of its auto output, has drawn more than $3 billion in investments from a clutch of Chinese EV makers, including Neta, who were partly lured to Southeast Asia’s second-largest economy by the government incentive scheme.

“Neta’s case should give the Thai policymakers pause,” said Ben Kiatkwankul, partner at Bangkok-based government affairs advisory firm, Maverick Consulting Group.

Last December, after a sharp sales contraction, Thailand’s Board of Investment gave EV makers an extension to the initial local production timeline to avoid oversupply and a worsening price war.

Under the original scheme, local EV production in 2024 was required to match each vehicle imported between February 2022 to December 2023 or the automaker would incur hefty fines.

Car manufacturers avoided those fines with the extension carrying over unmet production into this year, but at a higher ratio of 1.5 times imports.

Thailand’s Board of Investment did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Siamnat Panassorn, vice president of the Electric Vehicle Association of Thailand, said Neta’s issues were company-specific and did not reflect flaws in Thai policies or the market.

But external shocks, including geopolitical tensions and the spectre of higher tariffs, have added to the pressure felt by the sector, he said.

For Thai Neta dealers like Chatdanai Komrutai, the crisis is deepening. The brand’s car owners have taken to social media in droves to share maintenance issues and limited after-sales support and a consumer watchdog agency is inspecting some of those complaints.

“Selling cars is difficult right now,” Chatdanai said. “There’s no confidence.”

China's industrial policy has engineered a remarkable transformation to electric vehicles in what is the world's largest auto market. In so doing, it has spawned far more makers than can possibly survive. Now, long-simmering concerns about oversupply and debilitating price wars are coming to the fore, even as the headline sales numbers soar to new heights.

Market-leader BYD announced this week that its sales grew 31% in the first six months of the year to 2.1 million cars. Nearly half of those were pure electric vehicles and the rest were plug-in hybrids, it said in a Hong Kong Stock Exchange filing. The company phased out internal combustion engine cars in 2022.

BYD came under thinly veiled criticism in late May when it launched a new round of price cuts, and several competitors followed suit. The chairman of Great Wall Motors warned the industry could come under threat if it continues on the same trajectory.

“When volumes get bigger, it’s just much harder to manage and you become the bullseye,” said Lei Xing, an independent analyst who follows the industry.

The government is trying to rein in what is called “involution” — a term initially applied to the rat race for young people in China and now to companies and industries engaged in meaningless competition that leads nowhere.

BYD has come under criticism for using its dominant position in ways that some consider unfair, sparking price wars that have caused losses across the industry, said Murthy Grandhi, an India-based financial risk analyst at GlobalData.

With the price war in its fourth year, Chinese automakers are looking abroad for profits. BYD's overseas sales more than doubled to 464,000 units in the first half of this year. Worried governments in the U.S. and EU have imposed tariffs on made-in-China electric vehicles, saying that subsidies have given them an unfair advantage.

Market leader BYD comes under attack

The latest bout of handwringing started when BYD cut the price of more than 20 models on May 23.

The same day, the chairman of Great Wall Motors, Wei Jianjun, said he was pessimistic about what he called the ""healthy development” of the EV market. He drew a comparison to Evergrande, the Chinese real estate giant whose collapse sent the entire industry into a downturn from which it has yet to recover.

""The Evergrande in the automobile industry already exists, but it is just yet to explode,” he said in a video message posted on social media.

Two days later, a BYD executive rejected any comparison to Evergrande and posted data-filled charts to buttress his case.

“To be honest, I am confused and angry and it’s ridiculous!” Li Yunfei, BYD's general manager of brand and public relations, wrote on social media. “All these come from the shocking remarks made by Chairman Wei of Great Wall Motors.”

Next, the government and an industry association weighed in. The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers called for fair competition and healthy development of the industry, noting that major price cuts by one automaker had triggered a new price war panic.

On the same day, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology vowed to tackle involution-style competition in the auto industry, saying that recent disorderly price wars posed a treat to the healthy and sustainable development of the sector.

“That price cut might have been the final straw that irked both competitors and regulators for the ruthlessness that BYD continues to show,” Lei said.

A promise to pay suppliers within 60 days signals possible shift

The following month, 17 automakers including BYD made a pledge: They would pay their suppliers within 60 days.

One way China's automakers have been surviving the bruising price wars is by delaying the payments for months. The agreement, if adhered to, would reduce financial pressure on suppliers and could rein in some of the fierce competition.

“The introduction of the 60-day payment pledge is the call of the government to oppose involution-style competition,"" said Cui Dongshu, the secretary-general of the China Passenger Car Association.

It also reduces the risk of an Evergrande-like scenario.

Many automakers had stretched out payments by paying suppliers with short-term debt — promises to repay them in a certain period of time — instead of cash. Real estate developers used the same system. It worked until it didn't. When Evergrande defaulted on its debts, suppliers were left holding worthless promises to pay.

“This practice is seen as a potential cause of a larger crisis, similar to what happened with Evergrande,” Grandhi said.

The vows to speed up payments and the government calls to rein in the price wars, along with a rollback of some financing offers, point to an effort to reverse downward price expectations, said Jing Yang, a director at Fitch Ratings who focuses on the auto industry.

“We may watch how effectively these measures are in reversing the price trend and how would that affect EV demand in the coming quarters,” she said.","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/07/04/PDTN/84467295007-ap-25185015841913.jpg?crop=8629,4859,x0,y898&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-07-04 05:05:59.001932

The legislation introduces broad changes to federal energy and tax policies, with significant impacts on clean energy incentives and fossil fuel development.

Termination of clean energy tax credits

The bill terminates several federal tax credits that support clean energy technologies. These include credits for previously-owned and new clean vehicles, qualified commercial clean vehicles, and alternative fuel refueling infrastructure. It also ends the energy efficient home improvement, residential clean energy, and new energy efficient home construction tax credits.

Clean electricity production and investment tax credits are set to expire earlier than under existing law, with limited exceptions for certain advanced nuclear facilities. The clean hydrogen production tax credit is eliminated, and accelerated phaseouts apply to the advanced manufacturing production tax credit and the energy investment tax credit for geothermal facilities. Several of these credits are disallowed for certain foreign entities and related taxpayers.

Expansion of fossil fuel leasing and development on federal lands

The legislation directs the U.S. Department of the Interior to immediately resume quarterly onshore oil and gas lease sales and reinstates noncompetitive leasing for lands without competitive bids. It lowers royalty rates for oil, gas, and coal extraction on federal lands and expedites permitting for natural gas projects, including pipelines from Alaska.

Specifically, the bill mandates at least four lease sales in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) within seven years, with revenue sharing between Alaska and the federal government. Offshore oil and gas lease sales are required in the Gulf of Mexico and the Cook Inlet Planning Area in Alaska, alongside an increase in revenue distribution caps under the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act.

In coal leasing, the Interior Department must complete environmental reviews and conduct lease sales promptly, make additional federal coal resources available in western states, and nullify a previous leasing moratorium. The bill temporarily lowers coal royalty rates and authorizes mining of federal coal reserves under an existing lease in Montana.

The bill modifies the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review process by allowing applicants to pay fees to expedite environmental assessments or impact statements and removing judicial review of their adequacy. It rescinds funding for the Council on Environmental Quality’s environmental data collection and community mapping efforts.

Funding is also rescinded for energy efficiency training programs, tribal energy loan guarantees, and coastal and marine conservation managed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Programs protecting old-growth forests and certain conservation projects of the National Park Service and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lose funding as well.

The bill requires the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management to enter long-term contracts with private entities to increase timber harvesting by at least 25% over recent volumes, according to applicable forest plans.

On taxation, the bill raises the federal cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions to $40,400 for individuals ($20,200 for married filing separately), with phased reductions for high-income taxpayers. It disallows SALT deductions for most foreign real property taxes and limits deductions for certain payments generating specific tax benefits.

Renewable industry response

Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), described the bill as “a significant step backwards for our nation’s energy economy at a time when we can least afford it.” She emphasized that the bill jeopardizes a growing manufacturing boom, with new solar and battery storage factories opening nationwide and creating thousands of jobs. Hopper warned that many of these facilities “will be forced to shut down and lay off thousands of workers,” which she said would undermine rural communities and hand “an untimely and strategic victory to China.”

Hopper also noted the challenges posed by rising energy costs and global instability, underscoring that solar and storage remain “America’s best bet to lower energy costs, build long-term energy resilience, and break free from the grip of foreign energy dependence.” She expressed particular concern for the residential solar sector, highlighting the “total disregard for the thousands of small businesses… that were given only months to reinvent themselves.” Despite these setbacks, Hopper vowed that SEIA will “keep fighting every day for smart, stable, business-friendly policies” that support American energy independence.

Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association (ACP), called the bill “a dramatic swing in federal policy” that disrupts investments by American companies and “raises prices for American businesses and families.” He warned that the legislation could challenge the reliability of the existing electric grid by restricting energy production.

Nonetheless, Grumet pointed to the strong underlying demand for clean energy, noting that “America’s electricity demand is projected to surge by as much as 50% by 2040.” He stressed that clean power technologies, including solar, wind, and battery storage, “are the only shovel-ready sources of additional power and the low-cost option across much of the nation.” Grumet concluded with a call for cooperation, urging that “it is time for the brawlers to get out of the way and let the builders get back to work.”

Industry leaders’ statements reflect concerns that while the bill meets broader political and fiscal aims, it risks slowing progress in the renewable energy sector at a crucial moment.

Buyers have until Sept. 30 to qualify for the federal tax credits on EVs before they are terminated. But experts say there are still strong financial reasons to consider buying the vehicles even without those incentives.

Before the bill passed, new electric vehicles came with a $7,500 federal tax credit, and used EVs included up to $4,000. Those incentives were originally designed to help make the vehicles more affordable. According to the latest data from Kelley Blue Book, the average purchase price of a new EV is roughly $9,000 higher in the United States than the average new gas-powered car. Used EVs on average cost $2,000 more than comparable gas cars.

Those credits, paired with other incentives in many states, helped bridge that price gap. Without them, Senior Policy Director Ingrid Malmgren of the nonprofit advocacy group Plug In America said they will become unaffordable to many lower- and middle-income Americans.

“That’s really disappointing because … they’re just a really great way to reduce transportation energy cost burden,” Malmgren said.

The up-front cost of an electric vehicle might be higher, but for those who can afford to consider the lifetime fuel and maintenance savings, Malmgren said the EV is still a good financial and environmental move in every state.

EVs are typically still cheaper to own long-term

That is because electric vehicles might not be cheaper to buy, but they are cheaper to drive. Malmgren said that even without the federal tax credits, an electric vehicle owner would still come out ahead.

“Quickly you’ll end up paying less than a gas car because it costs much less to fuel, and it needs almost nothing for maintenance,” Malmgren said.

Malmgren said the point at which an EV driver’s savings on fuel and maintenance outweigh the higher initial price varies. It depends on the kind of car and how often they are driven, as well as the cost of gasoline and electricity in an area. She said EV owners pay less in upkeep because the cars typically have fewer moving parts to maintain and require less frequent servicing. There are multiplecalculators online that pinpoint that moment based on some of those criteria.

A 2020 study in the academic journal Joule found that the average EV in the U.S. charged with a typical mix of public and private chargers saves the driver $7,700 in fuel costs over a 15-year life span, compared to filling a car with gas. Savings vary by state. The study found that someone charging a car at home during off-peak hours, deemed as a best-case scenario, could save more than $14,000 over 15 years in Washington, where electricity is relatively affordable. The study said that an EV driver in any state exhibiting typical driving and charging behavior would save money on fuel costs. The study did not account for the car’s purchase price, its maintenance cost or associated tax credits.

EVs are still cleaner, even when they charge on coal power

Manufacturing an electric vehicle typically creates more pollution than making a traditional gas-powered one. But experts say that driving an EV over the long term is still less polluting than a gas car.

Once they both drive about 15,000 miles (24,000 km) — slightly more than the average American drives in a year — the total pollution that has gone into making and driving each type of car has evened out, said Peter Slowik, U.S. Passenger Vehicles Lead for the International Council on Clean Transportation. Every mile after that widens the gap between the cleaner electric car and the more pollutive gas car. By the end of the car’s life, emissions caused by the average EV are roughly half the average gas car, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

So unless you buy a new car each year, the EV is the cleaner choice, he said.

“They are a no-brainer,” Slowik said. “Electric vehicles are already inherently so much more efficient.”

A 2023 analysis by Yale Climate Connections found that electric vehicles are responsible for less carbon dioxide pollution even in areas where the electricity used to charge them comes from coal. An EV in West Virginia, which is one of the most coal-reliant states, still pollutes 31% less than an equivalent gas-powered car, according to the analysis.

Slowik said that is because electric cars are better at translating energy into forward motion. For example, the most popular EVs in the U.S., the Tesla Model Y and the Tesla Model 3, can drive more than 100 miles (161 km) on energy equivalent to what is provided by a gallon of gasoline.

“If you compare that to a 25-mpg gasoline vehicle, that’s already four to five times more efficient,” Slowik said.

More than 170 EPA employees put their names to the document, with about 100 more signing anonymously out of fear of retaliation, according to Jeremy Berg, a former editor-in-chief of Science magazine who is not an EPA employee but was among non-EPA scientists or academics to also sign.

Zeldin began reorganizing the EPA’s research and development office as part of his push to slash its budget and gut its study of climate change and environmental justice. And he’s seeking to roll back pollution rules that an AP examination found were estimated to save 30,000 lives and $275 billion every year.

The EPA responded to the employees’ letter earlier this week by saying policy decisions “are a result of a process where Administrator Zeldin is briefed on the latest research and science by EPA’s career professionals, and the vast majority who are consummate professionals who take pride in the work this agency does day in and day out.”

Slate Auto’s American-made electric pickup — the one with no paint, no stereo, and no touchscreen — is no longer priced “under $20,000.” The increase is a result of Trump’s “Big, beautiful bill,” which will end the federal EV tax credits on September 30th when signed into law later today.

That sub-$20,000 price for the Indiana-built pickup was a big selling point for the EV startup backed by Jeff Bezos, and was only possible after applying the $7,500 tax credit to the retail price. The price promotion was scrubbed from the Slate Auto site as recently as yesterday, according to TechCrunch. The website now shows an expected price of “mid-twenties.”

Slate’s under $20,000 price tag for a vehicle it won’t start delivering until late 2026 was always accompanied by an asterisk, with fine print highlighting federal incentives that were “subject to change.” And change was certainly expected: Trump campaigned heavily on the promise to end President Biden’s fictitious “EV mandate,” because electric cars are for socialists in MAGA world.

Trump’s embrace of oil and gas, while simultaneously dismantling incentives meant to spur the adoption of EVs and clean energies, is a gift to Chinese makers of electric cars, solar panels, and batteries. The US is now on course to own the past while China is firmly positioned to dominate the future.

China’s industrial policy has engineered a remarkable transformation to electric vehicles in what is the world’s largest auto market. In so doing, it has spawned far more makers than can possibly survive. Now, long-simmering concerns about oversupply and debilitating price wars are coming to the fore, even as the headline sales numbers soar to new heights.

Market-leader BYD announced this week that its sales grew 31% in the first six months of the year to 2.1 million cars. Nearly half of those were pure electric vehicles and the rest were plug-in hybrids, it said in a Hong Kong Stock Exchange filing. The company phased out internal combustion engine cars in 2022.

BYD came under thinly veiled criticism in late May when it launched a new round of price cuts, and several competitors followed suit. The chairman of Great Wall Motors warned the industry could come under threat if it continues on the same trajectory.

“When volumes get bigger, it’s just much harder to manage and you become the bullseye,” said Lei Xing, an independent analyst who follows the industry.

The government is trying to rein in what is called “involution” — a term initially applied to the rat race for young people in China and now to companies and industries engaged in meaningless competition that leads nowhere.

BYD has come under criticism for using its dominant position in ways that some consider unfair, sparking price wars that have caused losses across the industry, said Murthy Grandhi, an India-based financial risk analyst at GlobalData.

With the price war in its fourth year, Chinese automakers are looking abroad for profits. BYD’s overseas sales more than doubled to 464,000 units in the first half of this year. Worried governments in the U.S. and EU have imposed tariffs on made-in-China electric vehicles, saying that subsidies have given them an unfair advantage.

Market leader BYD comes under attack

The latest bout of handwringing started when BYD cut the price of more than 20 models on May 23.

The same day, the chairman of Great Wall Motors, Wei Jianjun, said he was pessimistic about what he called the “healthy development” of the EV market. He drew a comparison to Evergrande, the Chinese real estate giant whose collapse sent the entire industry into a downturn from which it has yet to recover.

“The Evergrande in the automobile industry already exists, but it is just yet to explode,” he said in a video message posted on social media.

Two days later, a BYD executive rejected any comparison to Evergrande and posted data-filled charts to buttress his case.

“To be honest, I am confused and angry and it’s ridiculous!” Li Yunfei, BYD’s general manager of brand and public relations, wrote on social media. “All these come from the shocking remarks made by Chairman Wei of Great Wall Motors.”

Next, the government and an industry association weighed in. The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers called for fair competition and healthy development of the industry, noting that major price cuts by one automaker had triggered a new price war panic.

On the same day, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology vowed to tackle involution-style competition in the auto industry, saying that recent disorderly price wars posed a treat to the healthy and sustainable development of the sector.

“That price cut might have been the final straw that irked both competitors and regulators for the ruthlessness that BYD continues to show,” Lei said.

A promise to pay suppliers within 60 days signals possible shift

The following month, 17 automakers including BYD made a pledge: They would pay their suppliers within 60 days.

One way China’s automakers have been surviving the bruising price wars is by delaying the payments for months. The agreement, if adhered to, would reduce financial pressure on suppliers and could rein in some of the fierce competition.

“The introduction of the 60-day payment pledge is the call of the government to oppose involution-style competition,” said Cui Dongshu, the secretary-general of the China Passenger Car Association.

It also reduces the risk of an Evergrande-like scenario.

Many automakers had stretched out payments by paying suppliers with short-term debt — promises to repay them in a certain period of time — instead of cash. Real estate developers used the same system. It worked until it didn’t. When Evergrande defaulted on its debts, suppliers were left holding worthless promises to pay.

“This practice is seen as a potential cause of a larger crisis, similar to what happened with Evergrande,” Grandhi said.

The vows to speed up payments and the government calls to rein in the price wars, along with a rollback of some financing offers, point to an effort to reverse downward price expectations, said Jing Yang, a director at Fitch Ratings who focuses on the auto industry.

“We may watch how effectively these measures are in reversing the price trend and how would that affect EV demand in the coming quarters,” she said.

Slowik said that is because electric cars are better at translating energy into forward motion. For example, the most popular EVs in the U.S., the Tesla Model Y and the Tesla Model 3, can drive more than 100 miles (161 km) on energy equivalent to what is provided by a gallon of gasoline.

“If you compare that to a 25-mpg gasoline vehicle, that’s already four to five times more efficient,” Slowik said.

The tight roll call, 218-214, came at a potentially high political cost, with two Republicans joining all Democrats opposed. GOP leaders worked overnight and the president himself leaned on a handful of skeptics to drop their opposition and send the bill to him to sign into law. Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York delayed voting by holding the floor for more than eight hours with a record-breaking speech against the bill.

“We have a big job to finish,” said House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. “With one big beautiful bill we are going to make this country stronger, safer and more prosperous than ever before.”

The outcome delivers a milestone for the president, by his Friday goal, and for his party,. It was a long-shot effort to compile a lengthy list of GOP priorities into what they called his “one big beautiful bill,” an 800-plus page measure. With Democrats unified in opposition, the bill will become a defining measure of Trump’s return to the White House, aided by Republican control of Congress.

Tax breaks and safety net cuts

At its core, the package’s priority is $4.5 trillion in tax breaks enacted in 2017 during Trump’s first term that would expire if Congress failed to act, along with new ones. This includes allowing workers to deduct tips and overtime pay, and a $6,000 deduction for most older adults earning less than $75,000 a year.

There’s also a hefty investment, some $350 billion, in national security and Trump’s deportation agenda and to help develop the “Golden Dome” defensive system over the U.S.

To help offset the lost tax revenue, the package includes $1.2 trillion in cutbacks to the Medicaid health care and food stamps, largely by imposing new work requirements, including for some parents and older people, and a major rollback of green energy tax credits.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the package will add $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the decade and 11.8 million more people will go without health coverage.

“This was a generational opportunity to deliver the most comprehensive and consequential set of conservative reforms in modern history, and that’s exactly what we’re doing,” said Rep. Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, the House Budget Committee chairman.

Democrats united against ‘ugly bill’

Democrats unified against the bill as a tax giveaway to the rich paid for on the backs of the working class and most vulnerable in society, what they called “trickle down cruelty.” Tensions ran high in the chamber.

Jeffries began the speech at 4:53 a.m. EDT and finished at 1:37 p.m. EDT, 8 hours, 44 minutes later, a record, as he argued against what he called Trump’s “big ugly bill.”

“We’re better than this,” Jeffries said, who used a leader’s prerogative for unlimited debate and read letter after letter from Americans writing about their reliance of the health care programs.

“I never thought that I’d be on the House floor saying that this is a crime scene,” Jeffries said.

“It’s a crime scene, going after the health, and the safety, and the well-being of the American people.”

And as Democrats, he said, “We want no part of it.”

Hauling the package through the Congress has been difficult from the start. Republicans have struggled mightily with the bill nearly every step of the way quarreling in the House and Senate, and often succeeding only by the narrowest of margins: just one vote.

The Senate passed the package days earlier with Vice President JD Vance breaking the tie vote. The slim majority in the House left Republicans little room for defections.

Political costs of saying no

Despite their discomfort with various aspects of the sprawling package, in some ways it became too big to fail — in part because Republicans found it difficult to buck Trump.

As Wednesday’s stalled floor action dragged overnight Trump railed against the delays.

“What are the Republicans waiting for???” the president said in a midnight post. “What are you trying to prove???”

Johnson relied heavily on White House Cabinet secretaries, lawyers and others to satisfy skeptical GOP holdouts. Moderate Republicans worried about the severity of cuts while conservatives pressed for steeper reductions. Lawmakers said they were being told the administration could provide executive actions, projects or other provisions in their districts back home.

The alternative was clear. Republicans who staked out opposition to the bill, including Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, and Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, were being warned by Trump’s well-funded political operation. Tillis soon after announced he would not seek reelection.

Rollback of past presidential agendas

In many ways, the package is a repudiation of the agendas of the last two Democratic presidents, a chiseling away at the Medicaid expansion from Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act, and a pullback of Joe Biden’s climate change strategies in the Inflation Reduction Act.

Democrats have described the bill in dire terms, warning that cuts to Medicaid, which some 80 million Americans rely on, would result in lives lost. Food stamps that help feed more than 40 million people would “rip food from the mouths of hungry children, hungry veterans and hungry seniors,” Jeffries said.

Republicans say the tax breaks will prevent a tax hike on households and grow the economy. They maintain they are trying to rightsize the safety net programs for the population they were initially designed to serve, mainly pregnant women, the disabled and children, and root out what they describe as waste, fraud and abuse.

The Tax Policy Center, which provides nonpartisan analysis of tax and budget policy, projected the bill would result next year in a $150 tax break for the lowest quintile of Americans, a $1,750 tax cut for the middle quintile and a $10,950 tax cut for the top quintile. That’s compared with what they would face if the 2017 tax cuts expired.

(WWAY) — Rep. David Rouzer voted in favor of the bill and sent the following statement:

“The One Big Beautiful Bill is historic legislation that delivers big wins to not just the fine citizens who live in North Carolina’s Seventh Congressional District, but to Americans across the country. The bill prevents the largest tax hike in history by making permanent key tax cuts that will incentivize the investment and growth necessary to stimulate the economy and increase wages. It also secures our borders, strengthens our national defense, cuts waste, fraud, and abuse across the board, and supports American workers by excluding tips and overtime pay from being taxed, as well as providing tax rebates for seniors. Additionally, this bill enhances the safety net for our farm families critical to their ability to operate, provides a major infusion of funding for our great Coast Guard, and makes significant investments to modernize our Air Traffic Control, just to name a few of the many other key provisions.”

Rouzer’s office also highlighted these parts of the bill in a press release:",https://www.wwaytv3.com/content/uploads/2025/07/e/m/trump-smirk.png,N,,2025-07-04 14:13:55.425756

In a statement Thursday, the EPA said it has a “zero-tolerance policy for career bureaucrats unlawfully undermining, sabotaging and undercutting” the Trump administration’s agenda.

Employees were notified that they had been placed in a “temporary, non-duty, paid status” for the next two weeks, pending an “administrative investigation,” according to a copy of the email obtained by The Associated Press. “It is important that you understand that this is not a disciplinary action,” the email read.

More than 170 EPA employees put their names to the document, with about 100 more signing anonymously out of fear of retaliation, according to Jeremy Berg, a former editor-in-chief of Science magazine who is not an EPA employee but was among non-EPA scientists or academics to also sign.

Scientists at the National Institutes of Health made a similar move in June, when nearly 100 employees signed a declaration that assailed Trump administration “policies that undermine the NIH mission, waste public resources, and harm the health of Americans and people across the globe.” An additional 250 of their colleagues endorsed the declaration without using their names.

But no one at NIH has been placed on administrative leave for signing the declaration and there has been no known retribution against them, Jenna Norton, a lead organizer of the statement, told AP on Thursday. Norton oversees health disparity research at the agency’s National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.

NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya, in his confirmation hearings, had pledged openness to views that might conflict with his own, saying dissent is the “essence of science.”

Under Administrator Lee Zeldin, EPA has cut funding for environmental improvements in minority communities, vowed to roll back federal regulations that lower air pollution in national parks and tribal reservations, wants to undo a ban on a type of asbestos and proposed repealing rules that limit planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions from power plants fueled by coal and natural gas.

Zeldin began reorganizing the EPA’s research and development office as part of his push to slash its budget and gut its study of climate change and environmental justice. And he’s seeking to roll back pollution rules that an AP examination found were estimated to save 30,000 lives and $275 billion every year.

The EPA responded to the employees’ letter earlier this week by saying policy decisions “are a result of a process where Administrator Zeldin is briefed on the latest research and science by EPA’s career professionals, and the vast majority who are consummate professionals who take pride in the work this agency does day in and day out.”

On July 1, 2025, the Senate passed One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) in a 51-50 vote, with Vice President J.D. Vance casting a tiebreaker vote. Although the House of Representatives previously passed its own version of OBBB (see our previous Alert for coverage of the House version), both chambers of Congress needed to pass identical bills before sending the bill to President Trump for signature. After a long night of deliberations among House Republicans, the House passed the Senate’s version of the OBBB on July 3, 2025. The passage of the OBBB by the both the Senate and the House accomplishes the Republican’s stated goal of having the OBBB on President Trump’s desk for signature by July 4, 2025, and the President is expected to sign the bill into law by that date. Much like earlier iterations of the bill, the final OBBB makes significant changes to many energy tax credits created or expanded by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The OBBB also includes many provisions that impose significant burdens on a taxpayer’s ability to qualify for credits with respect to projects involving certain foreign entities of concern.

Certain Changes to Clean Energy Credits Under Sections 45Y and 48E

Taxpayers generally may claim the section 45Y production tax credit for electricity produced and sold by a qualifying facility. Alternatively, taxpayers generally may claim the section 48E investment tax credit for qualified investments in a qualified facility or energy storage technology. For these purposes, in general, a “qualified facility” is a facility that is determined to have greenhouse gas emissions of less than zero, which generally includes facilities that generate electricity using wind or solar energy.

For both wind and solar facilities and other types of facilities, the sections 45Y and 48E credits begin phasing out for projects beginning construction during the second calendar year following the later of (i) 2032 or (ii) the calendar year after domestic greenhouse gas emissions from the production of electricity are 25 percent of the amount emitted in 2022 (25 percent GHG Phaseout).

For purposes of the domestic content rules under section 48E, under law prior to enactment of the OBBB, the “adjusted percentage” level that applies in determining whether manufactured products included in a facility are produced in the United States are based on references to sections 48 and 45, which references result in the adjusted percentage being fixed at 40% (or 20% in the case of offshore wind facilities). In contrast, under section 45Y, the applicable adjusted percentage increases over time depending on when a facility is considered to begin construction.

Changes under the OBBB

For facilities other than wind or solar, the section 45Y and 48E credits generally phase out in the same manner as before the OBBB, except that the OBBB eliminates the 25 percent GHG Phaseout. In other words, under the OBBB, the credits begin to phase out for facilities which begin construction during the second calendar year following 2032.

Under the OBBB, wind and solar facilities are subject to an accelerated phase out as compared to the law before the OBBB. More specifically, under the OBBB, credits are not allowed for a wind or solar facility that is placed in service after December 31, 2027; however, the December 31, 2027, placed-in-service deadline applies only to wind or solar facilities that begin construction after the date which is twelve months after the date of enactment of OBBB. Accordingly, to be eligible for section 45Y or 48E credits under the OBBB, a wind or solar facility must either (i) begin construction on or before the date that is twelve months after the date of enactment of the OBBB, or (ii) be placed in service on or before December 31, 2027.

For purposes of the domestic content rules under section 48E, the OBBB updates the “adjusted percentage” levels that apply in determining whether manufactured products included in a facility are produced in the United States, based on when the facility is considered to begin construction. Under the OBBB, facilities that began construction prior to June 16, 2025, have an adjusted percentage of 40 percent; facilities that begin construction on or after June 16, 2025, and prior to January 1, 2026 have an adjusted percentage of 45 percent; facilities that begin construction during 2026 have an adjusted percentage of 50 percent; and facilities that begin construction in 2027 and beyond have an adjusted percentage of 55 percent. This change applies on or after June 16, 2025.

For purposes of section 45Y and section 48E, no credit would be allowed for residential solar water heating property or small wind energy property if the taxpayer/owner rents or leases such property to a third party. This change applies to taxable years beginning after the date of enactment of the OBBB.

The OBBB makes the section 48E credit available for qualified fuel cell property at a fixed 30 percent credit percentage for property which begins construction after December 31, 2025.

For purposes of section 45Y, but not for purposes of section 48E, the OBBB adds a new type of energy community eligible for the 10% energy community adder that applies to advanced nuclear facilities that are placed in service in metropolitan statistical areas having employment related to the advancement of nuclear power. This change applies to taxable years beginning after the date of enactment of the OBBB.

Eversheds Sutherland Observation: The OBBB provides taxpayers a longer period of transition as compared to the original House-passed version of the bill, which allowed taxpayers only 60 days after enactment to begin construction and, for all types of facilities regardless of the timing of beginning of construction, required the facility to be placed in service no later than December 31, 2027, to be eligible for credits. The final version of the OBBB generally imposes the December 31, 2027, placement in service deadline on solar and wind facilities, but only with respect to facilities for which construction begins after the date that is twelve months after the date of enactment of OBBB. This 12-month window to begin construction should provide project sponsors and developers with additional time to begin construction on projects in their pipeline. Note that, under current IRS guidance, the beginning of construction determination includes a continuous construction requirement that is generally deemed to be satisfied if a facility is placed in service not later than the end of the fourth year after the year that construction began.

New Restrictions Related to “Prohibited Foreign Entities”

Definitions

The OBBB introduces the concept of “prohibited foreign entities” in new section 7701(a)(51). Prohibited foreign entities are ineligible for the energy tax credits, and taxpayers receiving material assistance from such entities are ineligible for certain credits. Additionally, taxpayers are prohibited from making an election under section 6418 to transfer certain credits to specified foreign entities. The concept targets entities associated with jurisdictions that the United States considers adversarial, primarily China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea, and prevent these entities from receiving tax benefits in the US.

The OBBB defines prohibited foreign entity as a “specified foreign entity” or a “foreign influenced entity.”

The definition of specified foreign entity generally includes terrorist organizations, specially designated nationals, organizations found to be engaging in conduct detrimental to the interests of the United States, Chinese military companies, and foreign-controlled entities. Foreign-controlled entities are generally the governments and entities associated with the governments of China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea. These definitions cite several other statutes, some of which are based on designations that are made or updated by the executive branch. Because of this, the list of specified foreign entities may change.

A foreign influenced entity is generally one in which a specified foreign entity can appoint an officer or board member of such entity, a single specified foreign entity owns at least 25 percent of such entity, one or more specified foreign entities own at least 40 percent of such entity, or at least 15 percent of the debt of such entity has been issued to one or more specified foreign entities. An entity may also be a foreign influenced entity if it makes payments to a specified foreign entity subject to an agreement and under such agreement the specified foreign entity may exercise “effective control” over a facility or energy storage technology of the taxpayer. Effective control is generally the unrestricted contractual right to make key choices with respect to the production or activities of the facility or energy storage technology.

Material Assistance from a Prohibited Foreign Entity

For certain energy tax credits (the section 45Y credit, the section 48E credit, and the section 45X credit), taxpayers who receive “material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity” are ineligible for credits.

A prohibited foreign entity is considered to provide assistance to a project when the prohibited foreign entity supplies manufactured products (including components) to such project.

Whether a taxpayer received material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity is an objective test determined by comparing the “material assistance cost ratio” to a defined threshold percentage. If the material assistance cost ratio is less than the threshold percentage, the taxpayer has received material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity.

The material assistance cost ratio is generally calculated by subtracting the total direct costs to a taxpayer attributable to all products from a prohibited foreign entity from the total direct construction costs of the project. This number is then divided by the total direct construction costs.

The OBBB has threshold percentages differentiated by types of property. By way of example, the table below shows the threshold percentages for qualified facilities.

Threshold Percentage for Qualified Facilities:

Beginning of Construction Percentage 2026 40% 2027 45% 2028 50% 2029 55% After Dec. 31, 2029 60%

Recapture of the Section 48E Credit

OBBB amends section 50 to allow for 100 percent recapture of the section 48E credit if a “specified taxpayer” makes an applicable payment before the close of the 10-year period beginning on the date the taxpayer placed in service investment credit property. An applicable payment is any payment described in the effective control provisions. A specified taxpayer is a taxpayer who has claimed a section 48E credit for any taxable year beginning after the date which is two years after the date of enactment.

Impact of Prohibited Foreign Entity Provisions on the Tax Credits

Credit Eligibility for Credit Material Assistance Restrictions Clean Energy Production Credit (Section 45Y)

All specified foreign entities and foreign influenced entities (without regard to the effective control clause) are ineligible for such credit in any taxable year.

If, in a taxable year, a taxpayer is designated as a foreign influenced entity because of the effective control provisions, no credit shall be allowed for such taxable year.

These provisions apply to taxable years beginning after the date of enactment. Applies to facilities beginning construction after December 31, 2025. Clean Electricity Investment Credit (Section 48E)

All specified foreign entities and foreign influenced entities (without regard to the effective control clause) are ineligible for such credit in any taxable year.

If, in a taxable year, a taxpayer is designated as a foreign influenced entity because of the effective control provisions, no credit shall be allowed for such taxable year.

These provisions apply to taxable years beginning after the date of enactment.

Recapture applies in the event of an applicable payment to a specified foreign entity within 10 years of placement in service. This provision applies to taxpayers claiming section 48E credits for any taxable

year beginning after the date which is two years after enactment of OBBB. Applies to facilities and energy storage technology beginning construction after December 31, 2025. Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit (Section 45Q) Specified foreign entities and foreign-influenced entities (determined without regard to payments made to a specified foreign entity) are ineligible for any taxable year beginning after the date of enactment of this paragraph. N/A Zero-Emission Nuclear Power Production Credit (Section 45U) Specified Foreign Entities: ineligible for any taxable year beginning after the date of enactment. N/A Foreign-Influenced Entities: ineligible for any taxable year beginning after the date that is two years after the date of enactment determined without regard to clause to the “effective control” clause). Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit (Section 45X) All specified foreign entities and foreign influenced entities (without regard to the effective control clause) are ineligible for such credit in any taxable year.

If, in a taxable year, a taxpayer is designated as a foreign influenced entity because of the effective control provisions, no credit shall be allowed for such taxable year.

These provisions apply to taxable years beginning after the date of enactment.

Eversheds Sutherland Observation: Although the OBBB allows taxpayers to receive some material assistance, as opposed to the original House-passed version of the bill, which allowed none, the material assistance provisions are punitive and could lead to difficulties procuring supplies that are primarily or solely available from Chinese entities.

Termination of Certain Credits

No section 25E previously-owned clean vehicle credit shall be allowed for any vehicle acquired after September 30, 2025.

No section 30D clean vehicle credit shall be allowed for any vehicle acquired after September 30, 2025.

No section 25D residential clean energy credit shall be allowed with respect to any expenditures made after December 31, 2025.

No section 45L new energy efficient home credit shall be allowed for any qualified new energy efficient home acquired after June 30, 2026.

Facilities which begin construction after December 31, 2027 would be ineligible for the section 45V clean hydrogen production credit.

According to the CBO, the bill would lower tax revenues by $4.5 trillion over 10 years and cut spending by $1.1 trillion.
Those cuts are now made permanent, while tax breaks for parents and businesses are expanded.
The bill also sets up new tax breaks for tipped income, overtime pay, seniors and auto loans, fulfilling Trump campaign promises.
The final version of the bill includes more substantial tax cuts and more aggressive healthcare cuts than an initial version that passed the House in May.","President Donald Trump’s tax-cut package cleared its final hurdle in the U.S. Congress on Thursday, as the Republican-controlled House of Representatives narrowly approved the massive bill and sent it to him to sign into law.

The 218-214 vote amounts to a significant victory for the Republican president that will fund his immigration crackdown, make his 2017 tax cuts permanent and deliver new tax breaks that he promised during his 2024 campaign.

It also cuts health and food safety net programs and zeroes out dozens of green energy incentives. It would add $3.4 trillion to the nation’s $36.2 trillion debt, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.

Despite concerns over the 869-page bill’s price tag and its hit to healthcare programs, Republicans largely lined up in support, with only two of the House’s 220 Republicans voting against it. The bill has already cleared the Republican-controlled Senate by the narrowest possible margin.

Republicans said the legislation will lower taxes for Americans across the income spectrum and spur economic growth.

Republican Representative Virginia Foxx of North Carolina described the bill as bringing “Historic tax relief for working families. Massive investment to secure our nation’s borders. Capturing generational savings. Slashing waste, fraud and abuse in government programs so that they may run more efficiently.”

Every Democrat in Congress voted against it, blasting the bill as a giveaway to the wealthy that would leave millions uninsured.

“The focus of this bill, the justification for all of the cuts that will hurt everyday Americans, is to provide massive tax breaks for billionaires,” House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in an eight-hour, 46-minute speech that was the longest in the chamber’s history.

Trump kept up the pressure throughout, cajoling and threatening lawmakers as he pressed them to send him the legislation by the July 4 Independence Day holiday.

“FOR REPUBLICANS, THIS SHOULD BE AN EASY YES VOTE. RIDICULOUS!!!” he wrote on social media.

Marathon Weekend

Republicans raced to meet that deadline, working through last weekend and holding all-night debates in the House and the Senate. The bill passed the Senate on Tuesday in 51-50 vote in that saw Vice President JD Vance cast the tiebreaking vote.

According to the CBO, the bill would lower tax revenues by $4.5 trillion over 10 years and cut spending by $1.1 trillion.

Those spending cuts largely come from Medicaid, the health program that covers 71 million low-income Americans. The bill would tighten enrollment standards, institute a work requirement and clamp down on a funding mechanism used by states to boost federal payments – changes that would leave nearly 12 million people uninsured, according to the CBO. Republicans added $50 billion for rural health providers to address concerns that those cutbacks would force them out of business.

Nonpartisan analysts have found that the wealthiest Americans would see the biggest benefits from the bill, while lower-income people would effectively see their incomes drop as the safety-net cuts would outweigh their tax cuts.

The increased debt load created by the bill would also effectively transfer money from younger to older generations, analysts say. Ratings firm Moody’s downgraded US debt in May, citing the mounting debt, and some foreign investors say the bill is making US Treasury bonds less attractive.

On the other side of the ledger, the bill staves off tax increases that were due to hit most Americans at the end of this year, when Trump’s 2017 individual and business tax cuts were due to expire. Those cuts are now made permanent, while tax breaks for parents and businesses are expanded.

The bill also sets up new tax breaks for tipped income, overtime pay, seniors and auto loans, fulfilling Trump campaign promises.

The final version of the bill includes more substantial tax cuts and more aggressive healthcare cuts than an initial version that passed the House in May.

During deliberations in the Senate, Republicans also dropped a provision that would have banned state-level regulations on artificial intelligence, and a “retaliatory tax” on foreign investment that had spurred alarm on Wall Street.

The EPA is now expected to begin detailed site investigations and develop a remediation plan — a process that could take several years.","Over a year after the Environmental Protection Agency sought permission to designate longtime Eugene wood processing plant J.H. Baxter as a Superfund site, the agency has received funding to move forward according to federal court documents.

The company — which was shuttered in January 2022 — was found to have illegally disposed of toxic wastewater from wood-preserving processes by evaporating it into the air, an operation that federal prosecutors alleged contaminated much of the Bethel neighborhood in west Eugene. Prosecutors later said J.H. Baxter vented more than 1.7 million gallons of chemical-laced wastewater between 2019 and 2021.

Bethel area residents had been complaining for years about bad odors and pollution, with some reporting alleged health impacts from the contamination. Environmental groups and state officials had also called for stronger action as testing revealed widespread contamination.

Earlier this year, several residents had their lawns replaced after toxic chemicals linked to the plant — including dioxins — were found in soil samples taken from yards across the area.

The Superfund designation unlocks millions in federal resources to help with the plant’s cleanup. It also places the facility on the EPA’s list of the nation’s most contaminated properties, which require continual monitoring and eventual remediation. The designation also gives the federal government authority to hold J.H. Baxter financially responsible for the cleanup.

In January, the company’s president, Georgia Baxter-Krause, pleaded guilty to violating the Clean Air Act and making false statements to federal officials, among other environmental violations. In April, the company was fined $1 million, and Baxter-Krause was personally fined another $500,000 and sentenced to 90 days in jail, which she has yet to serve.

“The defendant companies boiled hazardous waste into our community’s air instead of properly dealing with it, and Georgia Baxter-Krause lied when confronted about it,” Nathan J. Lichvarcik, chief of the Eugene and Medford branches of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Oregon, said in a press release following her sentencing.

Congress first approved a $7,500 EV tax credit in 2008 that it phased out after manufacturers hit 200,000 vehicles. The credit was expanded in 2022 to cover leased vehicles and the per manufacturer cap was lifted.

Separately, US automakers stand to receive significant benefits from the final bill that eliminates penalties for failing to meet Corporate Average Fuel Economy shortfalls. The measure makes it easier for automakers to build gas-powered vehicles.

Barclays auto analyst Dan Levy said the tax credit phase-out in less than three months means EV sales will significantly jump via a ""pre-buy"" since some consumers will move up purchases planned for later with sharp declines in the months to follow.

""We believe the bill reiterates the slowdown ahead for EV penetration in the US, with both the 'carrot' (i.e. tax credits/incentives) and the 'stick' (i.e. emissions regulations) softened,"" Levy wrote in a research note.

A Harvard University study released in March forecast that ending the EV tax credits would reduce EV penetration by 6% by 2030 and would save the government $169 billion in EV tax credits over a decade.

Last year, Chrysler parent Stellantis paid $190.7 million in civil penalties for failing to meet US fuel economy requirements for 2019 and 2020 after paying nearly $400 million for penalties from 2016 through 2019. GM previously paid $128.2 million in penalties for 2016 and 2017.

Clean energy is the only viable energy future—one that is sustainable, affordable, and provides the abundance of energy the world needs.
But this budget bill inexplicably and unnecessarily takes us backward.","Last Updated on:

Congress has passed a reconciliation bill for 2025. It has been misleadingly branded “One Big Beautiful Bill” by Donald Trump and Republicans, but it’s really One Big Bad Budget Bill. We’ve already covered it a bit, and I’m sure we will write much more about it in the coming days, but there have been some early, well thought out responses from cleantech industry groups, and I wanted to give them some air here. Read on and see what they have to say:

Solar and Storage Industry Statement on Final House Passage of the Reconciliation Bill — from SEIA

Following is a statement from Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) on final House passage of the reconciliation bill:

“The bill being sent to the President’s desk today is a significant step backwards for our nation’s energy economy at a time when we can least afford it. In the face of rising energy costs, global instability, and growing demand for power, Congress has turned its back on the very industries that are adding the majority of the new electricity generating capacity to the grid.

“America is in the midst of an energy manufacturing boom, with new solar and storage factories opening across the country thanks to the forward-looking policy this law will upend. Now many of these brand new factories will be forced to shut down and lay off thousands of workers, gutting communities that were finally seeing the kind of industrial revival rural America needs and handing an untimely and strategic victory to China.

“While this bill avoided some very damaging provisions, it is deeply disappointing to see partisan politics outweigh practical pro-growth solutions that serve all Americans. Solar and storage are America’s best bet to lower energy costs, build long-term energy resilience, and break free from the grip of foreign energy dependence. It is especially disheartening to witness the total disregard for the thousands of small businesses in the residential solar sector that were given only months to reinvent themselves.

“Regardless of what happens in Washington in the coming months and years, markets will continue to drive outcomes. The solar and storage industry is resilient, and SEIA will keep fighting every day for smart, stable, business-friendly policies that deliver on authentic and true American energy independence.”

Congressional Republicans Abandon Working Families and Vulnerable Communities — from BlueGreen Alliance

Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives upheld the Senate’s revisions to the budget bill working its way through Congress. The so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill” repeals clean energy investments that would create millions of manufacturing and construction jobs around the country.

Research confirms that killing these investments will shutter projects, cost jobs, limit American competitiveness in the global economy, and offshore our domestic manufacturing supply chain of clean technologies over the next decade.

The bill could also increase household energy costs by $400 annually within the next decade and will strip millions of Americans of their healthcare.

The bill is headed to the White House for President Donald Trump’s signature.

Following the bill’s passage, the BlueGreen Alliance released a statement from Executive Director Jason Walsh.

“The GOP passed this disastrous budget bill, and everyday Americans will pay the price. It clearly illustrates that Republicans in Congress do not work for their states or their districts—they work for their campaign donors and billionaires. This bill is a loud wakeup call that the GOP does not value working families.”

EnergySage Reacts To Congress’s Omnibus Bill Advancement, Consequences for Solar Industry

EnergySage, the nation’s leading home electrification marketplace for clean energy solutions, issued a statement today regarding Congress’s advancement of the omnibus bill that has been dubbed the “one big, beautiful bill,” which would eliminate the Residential Clean Energy Credit—also known as the 25D tax credit.

EnergySage Director of Insights Emily Walker issued the following statement:

“This bill doesn’t just eliminate clean energy tax credits prematurely—it will kill thousands of jobs, crush small businesses, and make home energy more expensive for millions of Americans. Clean energy is the only viable energy future—one that is sustainable, affordable, and provides the abundance of energy the world needs. But this budget bill inexplicably and unnecessarily takes us backward. We remain deeply committed to America’s clean energy future over the long run. In the short term, we will help as many American homeowners as possible go solar before the tax credits expire at the end of this year. Beyond that, we will serve the millions of homeowners for whom solar remains a smart investment and an important act of independence from rising utility rates. Our mission remains to fuel the growth of clean energy, support installers nationwide, and accelerate home electrification, so people everywhere can save money, be more energy independent, and make a difference in the fight against climate change.”",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/US-Capitol-Building-US-Congress-Zach-Shahan.jpeg,N,,2025-07-04 06:05:34.871294

Who is already achieving this in East Tennessee? On a large scale for manufacturing, AESSEAL Inc.’s North American Headquarters is using solar+storage to meet its own Net Zero energy goals. On a smaller, demonstration scale for educational purposes, historic Crawford House is showing how clean energy and storage can offset potentially all the electricity needed at that program center on the campus of Maryville College.

The Solar Energy Industries Association promotes a broad strategy to promote energy independence, strengthen national security, increase domestic manufacturing and support good jobs in the United States with clean energy and storage. SEIA is urging Congress to keep tax incentives in place that encourage manufacturing and clean energy investments for long-term benefits.

Watch here on the United States Department of Agriculture’s site for updates in July for the Rural Energy for America Program and potential grant opportunities for small, rural businesses to add clean energy with some federal grant support. In the past, this REAP grant, with the addition of tax incentives, has been able to offset a significant portion of the clean energy investment for small businesses seeking energy independence.

“All that and much more has already transpired on an administrative level throughout the federal government in under six months, and will now be codified and expanded upon by this budget bill.
Incentives for home solar and heat pumps, tax credits for buying an electric vehicle—all these could be erased.” And they were erased.","The US Congress has voted to approve Donald Trump’s astonishing “big beautiful bill,” effectively ending credits for wind, solar and EVs in the country, and in a move that some environmentalists say could condemn the world to a catastrophic 3°C of average global warming.

The passage of the bill through the Senate and the House were flagged as tight, but the assumed Republican holdouts quickly sold their “principles” in return for a few dollars and some local programs of little consequence. The impact on the rest of the world could be extreme.

The vote in the House on Thursday (US time) was followed by an extraordinary series of tweets and social media posts, celebrating not just the evisceration of Joe Biden’s Clean Energy Act, but the removal of social welfare support and healthcare to tens of millions across the country.

It confirms to many that the Republican Party has lost its collective mind, if that was not already abundantly clear. The bill is more or less as promised by Trump to the fossil fuel industry in return for an estimated $1 billion of support in his election campaign.

It comes as science and health programs are trashed, the judiciary is attacked, and human rights – including the fundamental right to live in a safe environment – are thrown out the door.

The bill provides trillions of dollars in tax cuts, mostly to the rich and ultra rich, provides more incentives ($US18 billion) and strips back regulations for the fossil fuel industry, and dismantles most incentives for clean energy.

“This budget bill is the largest-ever transfer of wealth from working families to the ultra-rich and one of the most environmentally destructive pieces of legislation in US history,” said Collin Rees, campaigns manager at Oil Change International.

“Congress voted today to turn its back on the very industries that are adding the majority of the new electricity generating capacity to the grid,” added Abby Hooper, the president of the Solar Energies Industry Association.

“Many brand new factories will close. Americans will lose their jobs. Investments will be cancelled. Consumers will have fewer choices. Our electric grids will suffer. And the race for the most strategic and innovative technologies will be handed to China.”

These are powerful words, but sadly of little consequence in a world where up is down, black is white, and greed is not just good, it’s great. The “big beautiful bill” is, on any reasonable assessment, the “big, beautiful lie.”

One analysis says that wind and solar generation capacity could fall by 340 gigawatts – below what could have been – and consumer utility rates may rise by 10 to 18 per cent over the next 10 years. And hundreds of thousands of jobs in the clean energy sector are expected to be lost.

An analysis by the REPEAT Project from the Princeton University Zero Lab and Evolved Energy Research shows that the bill is expected to contribute an additional 470 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions per year by 2035.

That is the annual equivalent of more than 100 million gas-powered cars on the road, and more than the annual net emissions from Australia’s entire economy.

In the last week, climate scientists have warned of the catastrophic impacts of global warming, saving that the carbon budget to limit average global warming below 1.5°C will be exhausted in two years, and the budget to limit warming below 2°C will be exhausted in nine years.

The US bill, scientists say, will make it difficult for the world to cap warming much below 3°C, particularly as Trump’s actions give cover for other countries to be less ambitious. Just look at Queensland to see how.

The Trump administration does not want this to be widely known, and this week shut down the Global Change Research Program’s website, globalchange.gov, along with all five versions of the National Climate Assessment report and extensive information on how global warming is affecting the country.

“They’re public documents. It’s scientific censorship at its worst,” said Peter Gleick, a California water and climate scientist who was one of the authors of the first National Climate Assessment in 2000. “This is the modern version of book burning.”

All of this should be a surprise to no-one, and particularly Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who has fallen out with Trump despite spending more than $A400 million backing his campaign.

As CurrentAffairs.org wrote this week:

“These actions and policies fulfill promises made on the campaign trail. As a candidate in 2024, Donald Trump propositioned oil company executives for $1 billion in campaign contributions.

“In return, he swore to roll out the red carpet for drilling on public lands, rolling back rules for power plant emissions and methane emissions from oil and gas fields. He promised to kill the electric car and renewable energy.

“All that and much more has already transpired on an administrative level throughout the federal government in under six months, and will now be codified and expanded upon by this budget bill. Incentives for home solar and heat pumps, tax credits for buying an electric vehicle—all these could be erased.”

And they were erased. And it’s not just book burning – now the White House will get to host a UFC fight on its front lawn. One day a Tesla car yard, the next day a fighting circus. The administration, and our future, is open to the highest bidder, and guess who has the deepest pockets.",https://reneweconomy.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cropped-RE_Favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-07-05 12:23:14.365615

Clean energy advocates, developers and investors say wind and solar are crucial for the nation’s renewables ambitions, and tax credits help to make them viable.","Congress passed a massive tax and spending cuts package Thursday that curbs billions of dollars in spending across clean energy. That means people will be paying a lot more for home solar, energy efficiency and other green technologies — and the nation’s efforts to address climate change just got a lot more challenging.

The bill supports mining, drilling and production of the oil, coal and gas that are largely driving Earth’s warming and the increasingly deadly and costly extreme weather that comes with it. Producing and burning these fossil fuels also contributes to air pollution and human health problems.

At the same time, the bill slashes tax credits for clean technologies including wind and solar energy. That will likely mean delay or cancellation of countless projects, affecting thousands of jobs and driving up household energy costs.

Here are four things to know about what the bill means for clean energy:

Cuts to home energy credits will make updates more costly

The climate law passed during former President Joe Biden’s term included tax credits for systems and projects at home, like solar and batteries, that save homeowners money over time and significantly cut greenhouse gas emissions.

These systems have gotten cheaper over the years but they’re still hefty upfront expenses that some homeowners would struggle to absorb without the credits. An average rooftop solar installation can run $20,000 or more; the credit has covered almost one-third of that. An average heat pump typically costs several thousand dollars; the tax credit reimbursed up to 30% of the cost, or $2,000.

The U.S. Treasury Department said more than 2 million families claimed more than $2 billion of the credit for upgrades such as windows, insulation, heating and cooling systems in tax year 2023 returns. More than 1.2 million families claimed more than $6 billion in the credit for solar installations, solar water heating, geothermal heat pumps and battery storage and other improvements that same year.

The bill ends both tax credits at the end of this year.

“No one asked Congress to make their energy bills even higher,” said Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, a nonprofit that advocates for cutting energy waste. “Taking away incentives for energy-saving improvements would raise monthly bills for families and businesses.”

But Republican lawmakers hailed the measure. Republican Sen. Mike Crapo of Idaho, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said it helps unleash American energy and will save taxpayers money.

“Extending good tax policy, delivering targeted relief and reining in wasteful spending is the best way to restore economic prosperity and opportunity for all Americans,” he said.

Electric vehicle credits disappear

The bill eliminates credits of up to $7,500 for buyers of new electric vehicles and up to $4,000 for buyers of used EVs.

That’s likely to hurt the growth of a technology that is seen as critical to cutting down on a big source of Earth’s warming. Transportation is the largest single source of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions — 28% in 2022, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

EV sales have grown steadily, making up about 8% of new car sales in the U.S. last year, according to Motorintelligence.com. Biden had set a target for half of all new vehicles sold in the U.S. to be electric by 2030.

But that purchase may be harder for consumers to swallow without a credit. EVs sold for an average of $57,734 in May, while new vehicles overall sold at an average of $48,799, according to Kelley Blue Book.

The credits go away after Sept. 30.

Big wind and solar projects will struggle to qualify for tax credits

For large-scale wind and solar, the bill speeds up the timelines projects must meet to qualify for a tax credit. The industry says it will be nearly impossible for many projects to meet those accelerated timelines, putting massive projects from Colorado to Texas to Arizona at risk.

The bill allows a full tax credit for wind and solar developments that start construction within a year of the law’s enactment. But projects that begin more than a year after the bill’s passage have to be operational by the end of 2027 or they won’t get a credit.

Atlas Public Policy, a policy consultancy, stated that approximately 28 gigawatts of wind and solar projects are planned to be operational by the start of 2028 but haven’t yet begun construction. Under the bill, they’re unlikely to qualify for a credit.

Wind provides about 10% of the electricity generated in the U.S., according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, with a goal of 20% by 2030. Solar is at about 4%, with the industry’s target at one point to reach 30% by the end of the decade.

Clean energy advocates, developers and investors say wind and solar are crucial for the nation’s renewables ambitions, and tax credits help to make them viable. But Trump has pulled the U.S. out of the Paris agreement, which calls on signatories to try to keep global temperatures from warming 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times.

Instead, the bill supports traditional fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, as well as nuclear power. Proponents say it will increase reliability since the wind doesn’t always blow and the sun doesn’t always shine.

“Americans need reliable and affordable energy, wasteful spending needs to be cut, and our country needs to be able to build again,” said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va, applauding the bill.

Experts say watch out for higher energy prices

But others say Americans can expect to see higher utility bills. That’s unwelcome news at a time when the nation’s growth in data centers, driven by demand for artificial intelligence, are sending energy use higher, and when climate change is fueling more frequent extreme weather.

Nonpartisan and energy groups estimate the bill’s passage could increase average annual electricity costs by more than $100 per household by next year. If fewer solar and wind projects are added to the grid because there is less incentive and it is too expensive for developers to do so without credits, some states could see increases of more than $200.

“At a time when energy demand is surging and families are already struggling to make ends meet, this bill would raise costs, make the grid less reliable, and make the U.S. more dependent on foreign oil,” said Lori Lodes, executive director of climate action advocacy group Climate Power. “It threatens our power supply just as extreme weather and record demand are putting historic strain on the grid, forcing brownouts and blackouts across the country.”

The loss of tax credits might not immediately impact project plans. But increased uncertainty makes it more difficult to invest in innovative new technologies and maintain national security.",https://coloradobiz.com/files/2025/07/AP25183500230973-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-07-04 01:05:22.018347

Sept. 25 was such a day as Defense Secretary William Cohen received the Best of the Best Stratospheric Ozone Protection Award for DoD efforts in reducing ozone-depleting substances throughout the military.

Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Carol Browner presented the award to Cohen, calling the DoD efforts ""an awesome achievement.""

""You showed the rest of the nation, you showed the world, how it could be done without shortchanging your commitment to excellence and what is obviously your No. 1 mission -- safeguarding America's freedom,"" Browner said.

She emphasized DoD is the leader among all federal agencies in environmental protection. During a recent award ceremony in Montreal honoring ozone protection efforts worldwide, DoD agencies and U.S. defense contractors received 20 percent of all awards, Browner said.

In accepting the award, Cohen praised the efforts of all armed services and the defense contractors. ""As the armed forces protect national security, they are also helping to protect global security in the larger sense -- the health of the planet we pass on to our children,"" he said.

Between 1985 and 1996, DoD reduced average energy use of its facilities by 15.5 percent, more than any other large federal agency. It has also become a leader in research and development of alternatives to ozone-damaging pollutants. These efforts are far-reaching because the department's specifications for environmentally friendly procedures and use of chemicals and are routinely used as industry standards worldwide.

Army, Air Force and Navy environmental programs were also honored during the ceremony.

The Army's Acquisition Pollution Prevention Support Office was cited for efforts in eliminating ozone-depleting chemicals from fielded weapon systems. The service's strategic guidance on the subject is used by more than 300 Army installations worldwide, other DoD and federal facilities, domestic airlines and 12 foreign governments.

The Air Force's Titan IV Program was honored for efforts of its Ozone Depleting Substances Reduction Team. The team eliminated 99 percent of ozone-epleting substances associated with the design, production and launch preparation of large, solid-fuel rocket motors.

Navy programs received two awards. The Naval Research Laboratory received top honors for efforts to reduce or eliminate the use of halon, an ozone-depleting substance commonly found in refrigerants and fire extinguishers. Researchers tested numerous alternatives to halon and selected a nonozone-depleting hydrofluorocarbon for use in numerous applications aboard Navy ships.

The U.S. Naval Surface Warfare Center was cited for efforts in converting shipboard air conditioning and refrigeration units to more ozone-friendly systems. By the end of September, 360 shipboard systems will have been converted and more than 100 ships will be free of ozone-damaging chlorofluorocarbon-12.

Individuals and defense contractors also were honored at the ceremony. Individuals honored were:

Gary D. Vest, principal assistant deputy undersecretary of defense for environmental security;

Joel Krinsky, Naval Sea Systems Command;

Ronald W. Sibley, Defense Logistics Agency;

Joe Felty and Stephen P. Evanoff, Lockheed Martin Corp.;

Key components include: Permanent Tax Cuts: The lower individual and business tax rates from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act would become permanent.
Small Business Income Tax Deduction: Small businesses, including partnerships and S corporations, can permanently deduct 20 percent of qualified business income.
Expanded Child Tax Credit: The child tax credit would increase to $2,200 per child through 2028.
The Chamber also voiced support for improvements made by the bill to the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit and the Employer-provided Child Care Tax Credit (also known as 45F).","Congress has passed the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” a wide-ranging package that includes changes to federal taxes, health care programs, government spending, and more.

The legislation passed the House on July 3 by a narrow vote of 218-214 after passing the Senate earlier in the week, with a tie breaker from Vice President JD Vance.

Three members of Kentucky’s federal delegation voted against the legislation: Senator Rand Paul (R), Representative Thomas Massie (R), and Representative Morgan McGarvey (D).

Tax Changes

The bill builds on the 2017 tax reform law by making several provisions permanent and expanding them. Key components include:

Permanent Tax Cuts: The lower individual and business tax rates from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act would become permanent. The tax rates were set to expire in December of this year.

Small Business Income Tax Deduction: Small businesses, including partnerships and S corporations, can permanently deduct 20 percent of qualified business income.

Business Investments: Immediate expensing for domestic research and development (R&D) expenses was made permanent. One hundred percent bonus depreciation for investments in short-lived assets was also permanently restored.

Expanded Child Tax Credit: The child tax credit would increase to $2,200 per child through 2028.

Higher SALT Deduction Cap: Households earning $500,000 or less could deduct up to $40,000 in state and local taxes through 2029, then it reverts to $10,000 in 2030

New Tax Exemptions: Income from tips, overtime, and car loan interest (on vehicles assembled in the U.S.) would be exempt from federal taxes.

Phase Out of Green Energy Tax Credits: Tax credits for certain energy projects would be eliminated starting in 2029. To qualify before then, companies must begin construction within 60 days of the bill becoming law.

The Kentucky Chamber supported making permanent key elements of the 2017 tax reform bill, including lower tax rates for businesses, the small business income tax deduction, and the improved treatment of business investments. Analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Foundation found that the tax provisions of the final bill would increase GDP by 1.2 percent and create the equivalent 938,000 full-time jobs.

The Chamber also voiced support for improvements made by the bill to the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit and the Employer-provided Child Care Tax Credit (also known as 45F).

Medicaid

The package includes drastic changes to Medicaid, impacting Kentucky healthcare systems. As part of its advocacy efforts, the Kentucky Chamber sent a letter to Kentucky’s congressional delegation urging them to support health care providers, communities, and families by reducing or eliminating the Medicaid provider tax and the directed payment framework included in the bill. The letter reads:

“Hospitals throughout the country remain under extraordinary financial strain. Directed payments help bridge the gap by using legally authorized tax structures to support safety-net hospitals that provide life-saving care, train the next generation of physicians, and are often their communities’ largest employer. Hospitals will be forced to make devastating decisions without these supplemental payments: eliminating key services, reducing staff, or even closing their doors altogether. These outcomes would disproportionately impact low-income families, rural residents, and communities already facing barriers to care.”

Deepa, this is clearly a win for President Trump.
How does President Trump plan to overcome that?","ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:

President Trump's massive tax and policy bill is now set for him to sign into law. House Republicans won over internal opposition from both moderates and fiscal conservatives to rally enough votes to overcome Democratic opposition. The final vote was this afternoon. The package is basically the president's entire domestic agenda. It makes Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent and also adds spending for immigration enforcement and defense. That would be partly financed by cuts to Medicaid and clean energy, among other programs, though the package is expected to add trillions to the federal debt over the next decades - the federal deficit, rather.

Our correspondents are following what happened in Congress and the White House and what it would mean for Americans. Let's begin with NPR's Deirdre Walsh, who covers Congress. Deirdre, it was unclear until today whether the House would pass the latest version of this package. How did they get there?

DEIRDRE WALSH, BYLINE: President Trump was really the closer. You know, there were as many as a couple dozen House Republicans who threatened to vote no on this after the Senate passed the bill earlier this week unless they got changes. Conservatives complained it added to the deficit. Moderates warned that there were steeper Medicaid cuts in it that would harm their constituents. But Speaker Johnson said earlier today that Trump worked the phones. He had many members over to the White House. He got Cabinet secretaries involved. But in the end, none of these members got any changes to the bill that passed. They voted for the same bill they spent days railing against.

Some suggested the president could use executive actions to tweak how the bill is implemented, but the speaker admitted he didn't really know how that would work. You know, these Republicans made a political calculation after a ton of political pressure from both the White House and the Republican base to get in line with Trump, and they did with the exception of two Republicans who voted no - Tom Massie of Kentucky and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania.

SHAPIRO: So that's the view from Congress. Now let's turn to White House correspondent Deepa Shivaram. Deepa, this is clearly a win for President Trump. What can you tell us about his influence on the process?

DEEPA SHIVARAM, BYLINE: Yeah, well, according to the White House, the president was deeply involved in the process. He was holding calls with lawmakers, like Deirdre said, who were on the fence about this. And they described, you know, Trump's relationships with lawmakers that he's built since being in office as helping a, quote, ""cascade"" of support come together in the end. And, you know, Deirdre had also just mentioned Representative Tom Massie. That's kind of a good example here of someone who didn't really get in line with Trump and behind Trump on this bill. He said that he wasn't going to vote for the legislation, and ever since then, the president has been posting about Massie on Truth Social, which is his social media platform, saying he's going to support a primary challenger for that seat in Kentucky.

And so, you know, whether it was online, through the phones, there was definitely just a lot of influence from the president in this process. Even yesterday, he was posting online, saying to Republican members, quote, ""it should be an easy vote."" So a very heavy-handed Trump in this process.

SHAPIRO: Some of the reservations from members of Congress come from the fact that a lot of voters and constituents have reservations about it. How does President Trump plan to overcome that?

SHIVARAM: Well, the interesting thing about Trump in that regard is that he's not running for reelection, right? So he doesn't really have to answer to voters here. So answering those concerns might fall more on Republican members who have to go back to their home districts, face their constituents about some of these issues. And the big one there, Ari, is changes to Medicaid, which is the health insurance program for lower-income Americans, the elderly, the disabled. And the fact that there are changes being made to that program in the first place is a violation of a campaign promise that Trump made, which is that he wouldn't touch Medicaid at all. And now, under this bill, nearly 12 million people are expected to lose their coverage in the next decade.

SHAPIRO: Well, let's talk more about the impact this is going to have on Americans. And for that, I want to bring in NPR chief economics correspondent Scott Horsley. Scott, are Americans going to feel immediate differences once the president signs this bill into law?

SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: This is not going to feel like a windfall to most people because this bill just keeps the 2017 tax cuts in place. Most people's take-home pay is not going to change very much. Taxes that would have gone up will instead stay the same. Now, for those at the top of the income ladder, they will avoid what would have been a pretty sizable tax hit. According to the Tax Policy Center, about 60% of the tax savings in this bill go to the top 20% of earners, that is, people making more than about $217,000 a year. Middle-income families will see a smaller tax break, and those at the bottom of the income ladder may actually wind up worse off because for them, the cuts to safety net programs like Medicaid and food stamps will, on average, outweigh any of their tax savings.

SHAPIRO: When you put all this together, what are some of the longer-term economic impacts?

HORSLEY: Well, you mentioned the bill adds several trillion dollars to the federal debt over the next decade. Another thing it does is put a lot more money into immigration enforcement. So we are likely to see more deportations. The administration has also been closing off legal pathways for people to come into the country. Forecasters at the Brookings Institution and the American Enterprise Institute say we are likely to see a net outflow of immigrants this year and next. That's the first time that's happened in at least six decades. We've already started to see a drop in the foreign-born workforce. Over time, that outflow means there will be fewer workers, fewer people spending money and overall, a smaller economy than we otherwise would have had.

SHAPIRO: There was strong resistance throughout the entire process about some of the issues that Scott has just described. So Deirdre, when you look at both Democrats and members of the Republican Party who resisted this strongly, what does it say about opposition to this legislation that it eked out and passed in the end?

WALSH: I mean, for Republicans, it just shows you the shift in the party under Trump. You know, conservatives in Congress, many of them campaigned on promises to slash the deficit. But we've already talked about how this adds more than 3 trillion to the deficit in the next decade. The fiscal conservative wing of the party just has less power. There are members who tried to warn about the economic fallout of deficits. But the bill also adds 5 trillion more to increase the country's borrowing authority. You know, Republicans used to call for any kind of, you know, reforms to do anything like that.

You know, Democrats were very united on this bill and were very focused on the Medicaid cuts. But in terms of Republicans, this debate shows you what happens to Republicans who break with Trump. Those who thought about voting no saw what happened to North Carolina Republican Thom Tillis. He voted against this in the Senate on Saturday. He was attacked by Trump. By Sunday, he announced he wasn't running for reelection.

SHIVARAM: Yeah, and speaking of reelection, I mean, this is all now about the next election - right? - the midterms, 2026. Trump has to sell this agenda and this bill to the American people. And there are now potentially plans for Trump to travel around the country and take a victory lap of sorts to celebrate his agenda getting passed. And, you know, the White House said today they don't have any plans laid out yet, but he'll sign the bill later tomorrow at 5 p.m. on July Fourth, Independence Day, which meets that self-imposed deadline that he wanted.

SHAPIRO: And so, as this bill starts to take effect across the country, what are you all going to be looking out for over the next year or so?

WALSH: I mean, I think the Democrats are really banking on making this issue the central issue in the 2026 midterms. You heard that from Hakeem Jeffries, the minority leader who broke the record for the longest floor speech today, with the big applause line. He said Project 2026 starts today. But it is worth noting that some of these key provisions affecting Medicaid don't kick in until after the 2026 midterms.

SHIVARAM: There's a couple other things, I think, to watch with Trump. I mean, this bill has more funding for immigration enforcement, right? But how the administration goes about doing that work - if immigration raids ramp up, for example - it may not play out as well politically. There's already been some pullback from voters on how the administration has handled immigration crackdown. And also, while this bill focuses so much on Trump's domestic agenda and campaign promises, he's still dealing with a lot of issues on the world stage, right? - the Middle East, Russia's war in Ukraine, these recent strikes in Iran. So I'm also kind of curious to see how much of that might overshadow some of Trump's abilities to tout this really big domestic win.

SHAPIRO: That's NPR's Deepa Shivaram, Deirdre Walsh and Scott Horsley. Thank you.

WALSH: Thank you.

HORSLEY: You're welcome.

Indonesia’s Energy Compact sets out measurable and time-bound goals to drive its clean energy transition. Its key commitments include:

Renewable Energy: Grow the share of renewables in total primary energy from 12.3% in 2022 to 23% by 2029.

Solar & wind: Scale from 0.4 GW to 5.3 GW by 2029—a twelvefold increase.​

Energy Efficiency: Reduce intensity from 133.9 SBM/Mil Rp to 125.96 SBM/Mil Rp by 2030.​

Emissions Control: Cap emissions at 446 MtCO₂e annually by 2030, compared to a business-as-usual projection of 596 MtCO₂e

Investment Needs: Mobilize IDR 4,000 trillion (USD 272.7 billion) to meet 2030 energy transition goals.

(Source: Indonesia Energy Compact 2024)

These targets are not merely symbolic—they represent the scale of change required to meet Indonesia’s national development and climate goals. Delivering on them requires the alignment of capital, policy, technology, and project pipelines. That’s where ECAN stepped in.

Energy Compacts Finance Roundtable, Indonesia

In November 2024, SEforALL partnered with Badan Perencanaan Pembangunan Nasional (BAPPENAS), Indonesia’s Ministry of National Development Planning, to host the ECAN Finance Roundtable in Jakarta. This convening marked a key moment in converting policy ambition into investment-ready action. Senior representatives from Indonesia’s government ministries, development finance institutions, clean energy developers, utilities, technology providers, and private investors—from national to global levels—gathered to drive investment into Indonesia’s clean energy priorities.

What distinguishes ECAN is its integrated support model—combining matchmaking, capacity building, and progress tracking in a single global platform. This was translated into the event’s primary focus— to align investment strategies with Indonesia’s Energy Compact targets, particularly in accelerating small- and medium-scale renewable energy deployment. The urgency of this effort is underscored by Indonesia’s current climate finance gap. At the moment, public financial institutions contribute around USD 3.5 billion annually, primarily focused on renewable energy, while private institutions invest about USD 3.4 billion—yet only 3% of this goes to climate-aligned sectors, mainly in sustainable agriculture. According to CPI’s Climate Finance Assessment, Indonesia’s climate finance flows need to scale by 4.5 times to meet its 2030 targets—requiring a substantial increase in private sector contributions. ECAN’s role in facilitating investor–government matchmaking and de-risking tools provides a structured approach to closing this gap.

Indonesia’s engagement with ECAN has been jointly led by two key institutions— BAPPENAS and the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources of the Republic of Indonesia (Kementerian Energi dan Sumber Daya Mineral, or MEMR)—whose complementary mandates are central to the country’s clean energy transformation. BAPPENAS plays a strategic role in formulating long-term national development plans, aligning policies with sustainability and carbon reduction goals, coordinating investment priorities, and fostering international partnerships. MEMR, as the primary regulatory body for the energy sector, is responsible for implementing energy policies, managing licensing and compliance for energy projects, promoting energy efficiency, and accelerating the deployment of renewable technologies. Their joint leadership within ECAN reflects Indonesia’s whole-of-government approach—ensuring that clean energy ambitions are underpinned by robust planning, effective regulation, and coordinated investment frameworks.

“Indonesia needs to continue to encourage this. We cannot just run business as usual. Climate change, reducing gas emissions are game changers to encourage Indonesia's growth. Investment for the green transition requires costs of up to USD 51.6 billion per year, which is obtained not only from government financing but also from the private sector.” former Deputy Minister for Maritime and Natural Resources at Indonesia’s Ministry of National Development Planning/BAPPENAS, during the ECAN Finance Roundtable in Indonesia.

Key outcomes included:

Six thematic clusters were identified for follow-up engagement- Financing transmission infrastructure for renewable energy evacuation; Replacement of diesel gensets with solar rooftop for last-mile access; Revisiting ESG mandates in financing PLN (Perusahaan Listrik Negara) and Pertamina; Strategies for reducing currency risk; Governance structures for clean energy finance under the newly elected administration; and Data challenges and tracking new renewable energy projects.

Aligning action with upcoming SEforALL initiative focussed on financing approaches and ownership models for last-mile access including blended-finance and results-based models.

Identifying modes of engagement under ECAN with national actors including BAPPENAS, MEMR, JETP Secretariat, state-owned enterprises, national investors and other on-going initiatives.

These discussions mark the beginning of a coordinated, multi-stakeholder implementation phase that will support Indonesia’s decarbonization and electrification goals. You can read more about the roundtable here.

Partnerships for Possibility: Scaling Impact Through Collective Action

Indonesia’s progress demonstrates what is achievable when national ambition is paired with structured global support. Through ECAN, political will is transformed into practical outcomes—by connecting governments with the resources, financing, and partnerships needed to turn plans into progress.

Yet, delivering a just and sustainable energy future demands more than a single success story. It requires continued leadership, cross-sector collaboration, and bold action at scale. Governments around the world are encouraged to submit or update their Energy Compacts, using ECAN’s tailored support to align national priorities with global financing and implementation pathways. Technical experts, civil society, and the private sector have critical roles to play—whether by contributing innovations through multi-stakeholder compacts or by advancing local implementation.

ECAN is not just supporting Indonesia—it is shaping a model of action and accountability for countries everywhere. As more nations embrace Energy Compacts, ECAN connects countries with potential investors and financial institutions, and aids in creating viable investment pathways to fund energy projects.

To meet the 2030 targets, global clean energy investments must triple, and political momentum must translate into pipelines, partnerships, and progress. ECAN is the engine to make that happen.

Join the Network—bring your capital, innovation, and expertise—and help turn commitments into a just, inclusive, and sustainable energy future for all.

This bill is not the way to US energy dominance The final version of the “big, beautiful bill” is likely to undermine the Trump administration’s goal of energy dominance.
In short, the bill is a recipe for energy submission rather than energy dominance.","The Republican legislative package known as the “big, beautiful bill” powered through Congress this week, with the House, then the Senate, then the House again passing it. It next heads to President Donald Trump’s desk for an expected Independence Day signing ceremony. During this process, the mega-legislation has seen several major provisions pertaining to US energy added, others removed, and some refined. To gauge where the bill stands in achieving Trump’s goal of US energy dominance, Atlantic Council Global Energy Center experts share two analyses below.

The bill sets a foundation, but one bill won’t be enough

Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” represents a pivotal moment for US energy policy. Rather than serving as a final word on American energy dominance, the legislation initiates a new dialogue in Washington, DC, about how the nation’s energy system should be recalibrated to prioritize energy security—emphasizing reliability, domestic capacity, and system integration.

As artificial intelligence–driven electricity demand threatens to eclipse 100 gigawatts and accelerate exponentially during Trump’s second term, the bill underscores the urgency many Republicans feel to bolster US generation with dependable, dispatchable resources. Within this framework, technologies such as natural gas, nuclear, and geothermal are not only strategic choices but also reflect the United States’ comparative advantages.

Notably, the legislation cements nuclear energy as a foundational element in the nation’s future energy mix. Years of incremental, bipartisan support have matured into formal policy momentum. By positioning nuclear as a central pillar, the United States joins a growing global consensus on its strategic value, particularly as energy systems become more complex.

This direction reflects a Republican policy view that ensuring reliable, affordable power in an era of artificial intelligence, electrification, and geopolitical competition requires anchoring national energy strategy in long-term physical and industrial resilience. That means investing in infrastructure capable of withstanding shocks and in a domestic industrial base strong enough to supply the technologies needed to sustain it. To that end, the legislation includes provisions aimed at limiting the use of Chinese-manufactured components in the US grid, reflecting heightened concern over foreign influence in critical energy systems. It also responds to perceived shortcomings in other advanced economies. Countries with aggressive renewable rollouts, such as Germany and the United Kingdom, have faced high energy costs and reliability challenges in part because of fragmented grid planning and complex system integration.

Still, the legislation is only a starting point. Congress faces unfinished work—chiefly, permitting reform. Without streamlined processes to support the build-out of transmission, advanced nuclear, gas infrastructure, and geothermal projects, the nation risks falling short of the very objectives this bill sets in motion.

In this sense, the megabill serves not as a capstone but as a foundation for the next era of US energy leadership. In a decade likely to be defined by soaring digital power demand and strategic competition with China, the real test is not whether the United States has selected the right tools, but whether it can deploy them at the speed and scale required. And for those left outside the immediate strategy—particularly solar and wind proponents—new opportunities to shape the country’s energy future are all but assured.

—Landon Derentz is vice president, energy and infrastructure, senior director and Morningstar Chair for Global Energy Security at the Atlantic Council Global Energy Center.

This bill is not the way to US energy dominance

The final version of the “big, beautiful bill” is likely to undermine the Trump administration’s goal of energy dominance.

First, by cutting short the tax preferences enshrined in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) before their prior legislative deadline in 2032—an extraordinary precedent that will unsettle investors—Congress has created uncertainty in the reliability of all energy tax preferences. Rather than stepping back on the US roller coaster, investors are much more likely to wait to see what the next election brings, at least through the midterms.

Second, the bill egregiously wastes the billions in commitments made for hydrogen, carbon capture, battery, wind, and solar investments, as well as significant sums spent by companies whose business plans relied on the durability of the IRA tax preferences. Modest improvements in the Senate bill—such as a slightly longer begin-construction runway extended to mid-2026 for renewables projects—still leaves the medium- and long-term potential of these industries’ revenues, as well as their employment potential, severely undercut.

Third, Congress is essentially ceding the future of wind, solar, hydrogen, and battery investment to China. This legislation represents a stunning acquiescence to globally concentrated development and supply chain systems for these technologies in the hands of a US competitor. Rather than encouraging European and Asian allies to invest in their own industries or become customers for US-made components for these technologies (which are expanding everywhere else in the world), the bill will tempt other buyers to simply opt for the cheaper and already more mature Chinese components. This is catastrophic for the durability and diversity of these supply chains and US technological influence more generally.

Finally, the bill will undermine the speed and cost of providing new power generation for artificial intelligence and data-center hyperscalers. Major hyperscalers have already made commitments to zero-emissions firm power (based on nuclear power and other fuel combinations) for the post-2030 period. But with gas turbines largely subscribed through 2028, even integrated power generators, such as NextEra, have made clear that renewables with grid-scale battery storage make up the cheapest and fastest power they can access right away.

Rather than lowering the cost of all forms of energy supply to provide as much low-cost power as possible right now, Congress has gratuitously raised the cost of the source of power generation that can be delivered most quickly and cheaply before 2030. This will drive up the cost of renewable power, increase demand for gas turbines, and likely raise the cost of gas-fired generation, as well. The higher the price hyperscalers have to pay for power, the higher the price regular consumers will have to pay as they compete with them for who gets the next kilowatt.

The preceding Biden administration bill was called the Inflation Reduction Act; this one would be better named the Inflation Promotion Act, as its energy provisions are likely to raise the cost of electricity for industry and consumers alike. Likewise, the three-trillion-dollar increase to the national debt is likely to drive up interest rates throughout the economy and raise the cost of borrowing for all forms of energy and associated infrastructure. This includes the critical infrastructure the Trump administration claims it wishes to expedite permitting procedures for.

In short, the bill is a recipe for energy submission rather than energy dominance.

Looking Ahead The tax credit phase-out could reshape the EV landscape, challenging affordability and adoption.","On July 3, 2025, Congress passed legislation that will terminate the $7,500 federal tax credit for new electric vehicle (EV) purchases or leases and the $4,000 credit for used EVs, effective September 30. This decision, reported by Reuters, marks a pivotal shift for EV owners and the automotive industry, potentially slowing the U.S.’s transition to electric transportation.

Background on EV Tax Credits

Introduced in 2008, the $7,500 tax credit aimed to boost EV adoption by reducing upfront costs. Initially capped at 200,000 vehicles per manufacturer, the credit was expanded in 2022 to include leased vehicles and remove the cap, spurring sales. The $4,000 used EV credit further broadened access. These incentives have driven EV market growth, with EVs now holding a significant share of global automotive sales.

Implications for EV Buyers

The impending expiration is expected to trigger a short-term surge in EV purchases. Barclays analyst Dan Levy predicts a “pre-buy” rush as consumers accelerate planned purchases to secure the $7,500 credit before September 30. However, Levy warns of a subsequent sales drop, noting, “The bill reiterates the slowdown ahead for EV penetration in the U.S., with both the ‘carrot’ (i.e., tax credits/incentives) and the ‘stick’ (i.e., emissions regulations) softened.” This could raise EV costs, making them less competitive against gas-powered vehicles. For example, a $40,000 EV would effectively cost $47,500 without the credit, potentially deterring budget-conscious buyers.

Industry and Economic Impacts

The legislation also eliminates penalties for automakers failing to meet Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, easing production of gas-powered vehicles. This benefits traditional automakers like Stellantis, which paid $190.7 million in CAFE penalties for 2019–2020, and General Motors, which paid $128.2 million for 2016–2017. By removing these penalties, the bill reduces financial pressure on automakers to prioritize EVs, potentially slowing innovation and production.

A Harvard University study from March 2025 projects that ending the tax credits will reduce EV market penetration by 6% by 2030, saving the government $169 billion over a decade. However, the Electrification Coalition criticized the move, stating, “As EVs secure a growing share of the global automotive market, it is obvious that the future of transportation is electric; this bill forfeits America’s role in that future to China.” This suggests a competitive disadvantage for U.S. automakers against global leaders like China, where EV incentives remain robust.

Regulatory and Infrastructure Shifts

The bill scrapped a proposed $250 annual EV fee for road repairs, sparing owners additional costs. It also dropped a requirement for the U.S. Postal Service to sell its EV delivery vehicles, preserving federal investment in electric fleets. These decisions reflect a mixed approach to EV policy, balancing industry relief with reduced consumer incentives.

Looking Ahead

The tax credit phase-out could reshape the EV landscape, challenging affordability and adoption. While short-term sales may spike, the long-term outlook points to slower growth unless new incentives emerge. For EV enthusiasts and owners, the next few months offer a critical window to leverage existing credits before the September 30 deadline.",https://evxl.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Tesla-Unleashes-Final-Q2-2025-Promotions-for-EV-Enthusiasts-4.jpeg,N,,2025-07-04 00:00:11.220516

Buyers now face a deadline of September 30 to take advantage of the federal tax credits, which will no longer be available following that date.
These financial incentives were introduced to make electric vehicles more accessible to consumers.
Despite the loss of tax credits, experts argue that there remain compelling financial incentives to purchase electric vehicles.
Malmgren stated that, without federal tax credits, EV ownership can still yield significant savings when considering these long-term costs.","On Thursday, Congress approved a significant tax and spending cut bill that effectively eliminates federal tax incentives for electric vehicles (EVs). Buyers now face a deadline of September 30 to take advantage of the federal tax credits, which will no longer be available following that date. Prior to the bill’s passage, new electric vehicles qualified for a $7,500 federal tax credit, while used EVs benefitted from up to $4,000. These financial incentives were introduced to make electric vehicles more accessible to consumers.

Recent statistics from Kelley Blue Book reveal that the average purchase price of a new EV is approximately $9,000 higher than that of a new gas-powered car, and used EVs are typically around $2,000 more expensive. The removal of these credits raises concerns, particularly among lower- and middle-income buyers, who may find EVs increasingly unaffordable. Ingrid Malmgren, Senior Policy Director at the nonprofit advocacy group Plug In America, expressed disappointment at the bill’s impact, noting that EVs are an effective way to alleviate transportation energy costs.

Despite the loss of tax credits, experts argue that there remain compelling financial incentives to purchase electric vehicles. While the initial cost may be elevated, EVs are generally cheaper in terms of fuel and maintenance expenses over their lifespan. Malmgren stated that, without federal tax credits, EV ownership can still yield significant savings when considering these long-term costs.

The dilemma between upfront costs and lifetime savings varies based on factors such as vehicle type, driving frequency, and local fuel and electricity prices. Malmgren noted that numerous online calculators can assist potential buyers in determining their break-even point regarding expenses.

A 2020 study published in the journal Joule found that EV owners could save an average of $7,700 in fuel costs over a 15-year period compared to traditional gas vehicles. The savings can vary considerably by state, with individuals charging their vehicles at home during off-peak hours potentially saving over $14,000 in states with lower electricity rates.

Furthermore, while the manufacturing process for electric vehicles initially generates more emissions than traditional vehicles, studies show that EVs lead to lower pollution levels over time. Peter Slowik, U.S. Passenger Vehicles Lead for the International Council on Clean Transportation, emphasized that the long-term emissions from an EV significantly decrease compared to gas-powered counterparts after a certain mileage is reached.

In fact, by the time drivers accumulate around 15,000 miles—approximately the average annual mileage for an American—the total emissions associated with electric vehicle ownership have likely reached parity with gas cars. The U.S. Department of Energy reports that by the end of their lifespan, emissions from the average EV are roughly half of those from the average gas vehicle.

Notably, a recent analysis by Yale Climate Connections highlighted that electric vehicles produce less carbon dioxide even in areas where electricity is predominantly generated from coal. In West Virginia, for example, an electric vehicle still produces 31% less pollution than a comparable gas-powered car.

Overall, experts maintain that electric vehicles present a more efficient and environmentally friendly option, even in regions reliant on fossil fuels for electricity generation. Slowik reinforced the efficiency of EVs by noting that popular models like the Tesla Model Y and Model 3 are capable of traveling over 100 miles on the equivalent energy of just one gallon of gasoline, showcasing their significant energy efficiency compared to traditional vehicles.",https://news.ssbcrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Congress-Ends-Federal-Tax-Incentives-for-Electric-Vehicles.com2Fc72F422F301cf9e722eb22f3d73169e3e2412Fb7fb43e2a8fa4b2ebbc5.jpeg,N,,2025-07-04 01:03:27.101557

Sources: Reuters: Trump’s budget bill boosts fossil fuels, hits renewable energy AP News: Republican budget bill dismantles climate law passed by Democrats","President Trump has signed a sweeping budget bill that delivers a major blow to America’s clean energy transition. The legislation rolls back critical tax credits for electric vehicles (EVs). It also reduces support for renewable energy. At the same time, it steers policy firmly back toward fossil fuels.

⚡ EV Tax Credits on the Chopping Block

One of the most striking changes is the elimination of the $7,500 federal tax credit for new electric vehicles. This popular incentive will end on September 30, 2025. EVs will become significantly more expensive for consumers who don’t buy before the deadline.

It’s not just new EVs that are affected. The $4,000 used EV credit and the $7,500 commercial EV credit will also expire on the same date. Charging infrastructure incentives are likewise set to phase out by mid-2026, limiting support for expanding the nation’s charging network.

For many drivers and fleet operators, this rollback poses a threat. It will most definitely stall the adoption of cleaner transportation. This occurs at a time when cleaner transportation is needed most.

🌞 Renewable Energy Tax Incentives Cut Short

The bill doesn’t stop with EVs. It also shortens the timeline for solar and wind investment tax credits. New deadlines will force projects to start construction by mid-2026 or risk losing eligibility. For developers, this accelerated phaseout creates uncertainty and will kill off projects that can’t meet the tighter timeline.

Energy-efficient home improvement credits also take a hit. This reduction impacts incentives for homeowners. It discourages upgrades that cut emissions and save on energy bills.

🏛️ IRA Funding Rescinded

The new legislation claws back unspent funding from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). That includes money for emissions reduction programs, green building initiatives, tribal energy support, and more. By stripping away these investments, the bill undercuts efforts to modernize America’s energy infrastructure and reduce climate pollution.

🛢️ A Boost for Fossil Fuels

In stark contrast, the bill promotes fossil fuel development. It mandates new oil and gas lease sales in the Arctic and Gulf of Mexico. The bill speeds up permitting. It prioritizes expanded production of oil, natural gas, coal, and nuclear energy.

Critics warn that these policies risk locking in decades of extra emissions, even as climate goals call for rapid decarbonization.

📉 Impact on Clean Energy Growth

Analysts say the rollback of tax credits significantly impacts planned clean energy investments. The loss of IRA funding also wipes out hundreds of billions of dollars. Solar and wind developers cancel or delay projects. EV adoption will slump without federal support. And efforts to build a modern, resilient, low-carbon grid will face serious headwinds.

The fossil fuel industry stands to gain. Nonetheless, the transition to a cleaner, more sustainable energy system will slow down. This slowdown is happening at a time when urgency has never been greater.

✅ Conclusion

This new bill slashes support for electric vehicles and renewable energy. It’s important to recognize that it deepens the imbalance in U.S. energy policy. Historically, fossil fuels have enjoyed enormous and consistent government support. Subsidies have come from tax breaks, exploration grants, affordable leasing on public lands, and direct incentives.

According to estimates from the International Monetary Fund and independent research, U.S. fossil fuel subsidies and tax breaks total well over $20 billion annually. This figure does not even count the hidden costs of pollution, health impacts, or climate damage. By contrast, the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy incentives aim to help level the playing field. It provides roughly $369 billion over ten years. The funds are meant to boost EV adoption, wind and solar power, energy efficiency, and grid modernization.

Now, many of those green incentives are being stripped away or cut short. Meanwhile, oil, gas, and coal producers keep their longstanding benefits. They gain new ones from expanded leasing and faster permitting in this bill. The result isn’t a “free market” in energy. Instead, it continues to tip the scales toward fossil fuels. This comes at the expense of cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable alternatives.

For anyone serious about energy independence, climate action, or American competitiveness in emerging industries, these cuts are a major setback. They represent a significant step backwards. The question isn’t whether the government should support energy—but which future we want to invest in.

China's industrial policy has engineered a remarkable transformation to electric vehicles in what is the world's largest auto market. In so doing, it has spawned far more makers than can possibly survive. Now, long-simmering concerns about oversupply and debilitating price wars are coming to the fore, even as the headline sales numbers soar to new heights.

Market-leader BYD announced this week that its sales grew 31% in the first six months of the year to 2.1 million cars. Nearly half of those were pure electric vehicles and the rest were plug-in hybrids, it said in a Hong Kong Stock Exchange filing. The company phased out internal combustion engine cars in 2022.

BYD came under thinly veiled criticism in late May when it launched a new round of price cuts, and several competitors followed suit. The chairman of Great Wall Motors warned the industry could come under threat if it continues on the same trajectory.

“When volumes get bigger, it’s just much harder to manage and you become the bullseye,” said Lei Xing, an independent analyst who follows the industry.

The government is trying to rein in what is called “involution” — a term initially applied to the rat race for young people in China and now to companies and industries engaged in meaningless competition that leads nowhere.

BYD has come under criticism for using its dominant position in ways that some consider unfair, sparking price wars that have caused losses across the industry, said Murthy Grandhi, an India-based financial risk analyst at GlobalData.

With the price war in its fourth year, Chinese automakers are looking abroad for profits. BYD's overseas sales more than doubled to 464,000 units in the first half of this year. Worried governments in the U.S. and EU have imposed tariffs on made-in-China electric vehicles, saying that subsidies have given them an unfair advantage.

The latest bout of handwringing started when BYD cut the price of more than 20 models on May 23.

The same day, the chairman of Great Wall Motors, Wei Jianjun, said he was pessimistic about what he called the ""healthy development” of the EV market. He drew a comparison to Evergrande, the Chinese real estate giant whose collapse sent the entire industry into a downturn from which it has yet to recover.

""The Evergrande in the automobile industry already exists, but it is just yet to explode,” he said in a video message posted on social media.

Two days later, a BYD executive rejected any comparison to Evergrande and posted data-filled charts to buttress his case.

“To be honest, I am confused and angry and it’s ridiculous!” Li Yunfei, BYD's general manager of brand and public relations, wrote on social media. “All these come from the shocking remarks made by Chairman Wei of Great Wall Motors.”

Next, the government and an industry association weighed in. The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers called for fair competition and healthy development of the industry, noting that major price cuts by one automaker had triggered a new price war panic.

On the same day, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology vowed to tackle involution-style competition in the auto industry, saying that recent disorderly price wars posed a treat to the healthy and sustainable development of the sector.

“That price cut might have been the final straw that irked both competitors and regulators for the ruthlessness that BYD continues to show,” Lei said.

The following month, 17 automakers including BYD made a pledge: They would pay their suppliers within 60 days.

One way China's automakers have been surviving the bruising price wars is by delaying the payments for months. The agreement, if adhered to, would reduce financial pressure on suppliers and could rein in some of the fierce competition.

“The introduction of the 60-day payment pledge is the call of the government to oppose involution-style competition,"" said Cui Dongshu, the secretary-general of the China Passenger Car Association.

It also reduces the risk of an Evergrande-like scenario.

Many automakers had stretched out payments by paying suppliers with short-term debt — promises to repay them in a certain period of time — instead of cash. Real estate developers used the same system. It worked until it didn't. When Evergrande defaulted on its debts, suppliers were left holding worthless promises to pay.

“This practice is seen as a potential cause of a larger crisis, similar to what happened with Evergrande,” Grandhi said.

The vows to speed up payments and the government calls to rein in the price wars, along with a rollback of some financing offers, point to an effort to reverse downward price expectations, said Jing Yang, a director at Fitch Ratings who focuses on the auto industry.

“We may watch how effectively these measures are in reversing the price trend and how would that affect EV demand in the coming quarters,” she said.

The 887-page bill includes spending cuts, tax breaks, military spending, money for deportations and other longtime GOP priorities like cuts to Medicaid and renewable energy programs. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that under the bill 11.8 million more Americans would become uninsured by 2034 and 3 million more would not qualify for food stamps, also known as SNAP benefits.

Some takeaways from Trump’s “big beautiful bill” and the path Republicans took to pass it:

Loyalty to Trump carries the day

By Congress time standards, the bill moved at lightning speed — reaching Trump’s desk less than six months into his term. That was only possible because Trump set a firm deadline, July 4 and pressured Republican lawmakers to get it done.

Few were left to resist, as most of Trump’s Republican critics over the years have either retired or lost reelection. Unfailingly loyal House and Senate Republicans were quick to make his priority their priority.

Plus, GOP lawmakers know they would suffer political consequences for dissent. One senator who did, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, abruptly announced on Sunday that he would retire next year — a day after saying he would oppose the legislation because of its reductions to health care programs.

“Tillis is a talker and complainer, NOT A DOER,” Trump had posted on X of Tillis.

Tillis joined Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Rand Paul of Kentucky in voting against the bill in the Senate. In the House, Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania and Thomas Massie of Kentucky were the only Republicans to vote against it.

Massie has also faced Trump’s wrath. “Massie is weak, ineffective, and votes “NO” on virtually everything put before him,” Trump posted last month.

‘Trifecta’ for the win

The legislation’s passage was a direct outgrowth of the GOP election sweep that gave them the White House and majorities in both the House and the Senate. The so-called “trifecta” of power only comes around every so often, and Republicans were determined that it not go to waste.

Crucially, holding power in both chambers of Congress gave Republicans the option of using a budget procedure that overrides the Senate filibuster and allows the majority to pass legislation with only 51 votes. That meant no Democratic support was needed and they never had to involve them in the process.

Both parties have used the budget procedure to pass priorities over the years when they have found themselves with a similar trifecta — Democrats to pass the Affordable Care Act under President Barack Obama in 2010, Republicans to pass tax cuts in 2017 during Trump’s first term and Democrats again to pass President Joe Biden’s climate, health care and tax package in 2022.

Thune and Johnson get it done for Trump

The bill was a major test for both House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., both of whom had very narrow majorities to navigate and wanted to show Trump that they could get his legislation passed.

The two initially disagreed on how to move forward — Johnson wanted one bill, Thune wanted two — but they eventually agreed and worked together with Trump to push the bill through each difficult step and win enough votes.

Whatever it takes to get the votes

As Trump pressured the GOP leaders for a big July 4 win, he appeared to be mostly flexible when it came to what was actually in the bill. So Johnson and Thune worked to get the votes by listening to members across the ideological spectrum and adjusting the legislation as needed to ensure that they kept nearly every single Republican on board.

To get that much support, the leaders packed the bill with personal priorities for some of their most skeptical members. House Republicans from New York won a higher cap on state and local tax deductions. Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley won long-sought money for those impacted by nuclear development and testing. Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski won several provisions to help her sprawling state, including carve-outs for Medicaid and food stamps.

Murkowski was the last holdout in the Senate, and Thune set votes in motion within hours of her commitment to support it.

“Failure is not an option,” he said a month ago. “We’ve got to get to 51.”

Democrats bet big on disapproval

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., have kept up a steady opposition to the legislation and believe that its Medicaid and food stamp cuts could win them new seats, and perhaps a majority, in next year’s midterm elections.

“This vote will haunt our Republican colleagues for years to come,” Schumer said after the Senate passed the bill. “Because of this bill, tens of millions will lose health insurance. Millions of jobs will disappear. People will get sick and die.”

Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz posted on X Wednesday evening that “it is entirely possible that we win the Senate” if the bill passes.

“I hope this bill dies, but if it passes they will pay a steep political price,” Schatz wrote.

Delay, Delay, Delay

With no power to stop the bill, Democrats embraced the powers they did have and forced long delays as Republicans neared passage.

Jeffries tied up the House floor for almost nine hours just as Republicans secured the votes, delaying their big win — and members’ flights out of town for the July 4 holiday — with a speech criticizing the bill and sharing stories of people who would be affected by cuts to Medicaid and other programs. “This is not who we are,” Jeffries said.

Schumer delayed Senate passage as well, forcing Senate clerks to read the entire 887-page bill, a step in the process that leaders usually agree to skip. It took almost 16 hours.

Debt ceiling fight is averted

One huge win for Republicans is that the bill increases the nation’s debt limit by $5 trillion to allow continued borrowing to pay already accrued bills. By adding that provision, Republicans avoided risking a U.S. default and also having to pass the debt limit increase separately, a move that would have required 60 votes in the Senate and Democratic support for passage.

The last time Congress raised the debt limit was 2023, after weeks of high-wire negotiations between the Republican House, the Democratic Senate and President Biden.

Starting at no, ending at yes

Many Republicans had deep concerns about the bill. Almost every one of them voted for it anyway.

Hawley and Murkowski strongly criticized the Medicaid cuts, but voted for the legislation when some of their state priorities were added. Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson had once called the legislation “immoral” and “grotesque,” arguing that it would raise deficits. But he also voted for it.

New York lawmakers fought for quadrupling the cap on the state and local tax deduction to $40,000 in the House-passed bill and were unhappy when the Senate went along with that for just five years instead of 10 years. But, in the end, they accepted the change.

“I can’t be a yes on that,” Rep. Nick LaLota, R-N.Y., said. But when the roll was called, he was.

No ‘John McCain moment’

The late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., famously killed Trump’s attempt to repeal Obamacare when he became the deciding vote with a thumbs down in 2017. With narrow margins in both chambers, any Republican could have similarly killed this effort.

Murkowski, who, like McCain, voted against the Republican health care effort in 2017, was the only undecided senator left in the final hours before the Senate vote. But she ultimately supported it, a decision she called “agonizing.”

The bill claws back funding from the Inflation Reduction Act, the Biden administration’s landmark climate legislation, and changes or cuts energy and manufacturing tax credits. For example, solar and wind energy that are built and come online after 2027 will no longer be eligible for tax credits, significantly reducing the timeline for any projects to get off the ground.

The oil and gas industry, as well as mining, come out ahead in the bill. It reduces royalty rates that operators pay for oil and gas production on federal lands, and includes leasing mandates for federal land and water. There’s also a mandatory expansion of federal land to be made available for mining.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, solar and battery storage made up over 80% of the nation’s new electric generating capacity in 2024. That trend is expected to continue into 2025, with officials saying solar will be driving much of the growth in capacity.

Sen. John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.) said during a virtual press conference on July 2 that some of the more harmful provisions in the Senate’s bill, like an excise tax on solar panels, were removed, but still, the economic impacts of rescinding tax credits would be devastating.

“We're going to gut hundreds of billions of dollars in the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy investments,” he said. “This (was) a transformational moment to address climate change, and we weren't solving it, but this was a major step towards addressing climate change, and now… it's like running into a brick wall.”

“We got over 8 thousand solar jobs, just in Colorado,” he said.

Nonpartisan think tank Energy Innovation (EI) says these cuts will mean less capacity for the nation’s increasingly strained power grid. The group estimates that by 2030, there will be a 340 gigawatt decrease in generation capacity.

Sara Baldwin, the group’s senior electrification director, says this could harm fast-growing regions like the Mountain West.

“We would see a net loss of generation capacity that we would have otherwise seen built by 2035 in Utah, Wyoming, and Colorado, to the tune of eight gigawatts,” she said. That's enough energy to power 6 million homes.

EI estimates that because of the increasing reliance on coal and fossil fuels, the nation’s emissions would go up by 160 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2030, or the equivalent of adding 72 million cars to the road. Baldwin says for mountain areas like the Front Range and the Wasatch Front, which struggle with poor air quality, public health would be threatened.

Baldwin says many of the tax credits the bill cuts have been in place for decades, but the IRA expanded their reach, and added supplemental programs. She estimates that across the three states, there would be a loss of over 17,000 jobs by the year 2030.

“When you take something like a longstanding production and investment tax credit away from these businesses that are trying to create jobs in America, you are telling them that you do not respect the business that they have, and you do not want them to do that job creation here in the U.S.”

On average, EI estimates that Colorado and Utah households would see an increase in yearly utility costs of about $300. That number is about $150 in Wyoming.

Josh Shipley owns a small solar company, Alternative Power Enterprises, in Ridgway and Montrose, and he participated in Hickenlooper’s press call on the impacts of the bill.

“It looked like we had an off-ramp to 2032 to see these tax credits dissipate,” he said. “That was imperative in our business plan. That was part of how we were able to afford to continue on this company of now 30+ years. Instantly removing these tax credits at the end of the year is gonna be extremely detrimental. We actually don't believe we're going to be able to stay in business.”

Shipley says his business is one of just two installers in the area, and this could hurt the community’s ability to lower their energy costs. He says tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act have allowed his business to expand, helping people on the Western Slope reduce their energy costs.

“In the last handful of years, we’ve actually been able to start helping low income families be able to go solar,” he said. “I think in the last three years, over 120 families have benefitted from that.”

Sara Baldwin says the bill essentially takes the country back in time to a previous era.

“They chose to compromise quality of life, American jobs, domestic energy production, in order to give billionaires more tax breaks and more tax cuts,” she said. “(That’s) also to say nothing of the fact that they're taking away healthcare from millions of Americans who need it. They're taking away social safety nets from millions of Americans that count on those.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c1c8ee9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1050+0+283/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F0a%2Fdb%2F3c56a94b448cafc384e3fc498ad3%2Fbyron-komenik-farm-solar-panels.jpg,N,,2025-07-04 01:04:32.763730

On Thursday, Republicans in the U.S. House sent a bill to President Donald Trump’s desk that kills tax credits of up to $7,500 for EV customers that were part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

The White House has said former President Joe Biden’s initiative “promised much but delivered nothing.” However, the tax credits helped fuel an EV market far more robust and affordable than drivers enjoyed before the rebates kicked in two and a half years ago. Repealing them, along with a flurry of other anti-EV policies put in place or being pursued by the Trump administration, will put a serious dent in sales.

U.S. adoption is set to trail the global average through 2040 and will knock the nation out of the top three EV markets, according to a recent BloombergNEF report. Last year’s version of the report had the country boasting higher-than-average sales starting in 2029.

Still, Elaine Buckberg, a former General Motors economist now at Harvard University’s Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability, estimates that even with federal tax cuts disappearing, some 37% of new cars bought in 2030 will be electric. That’s down from a forecast of 48% if the current incentives remained. The factors propping up some of the demand are fairly straightforward: Electric cars are far better and cheaper than they used to be, and there are many more models to choose from.

“In the most likely scenario, you end up about two years behind on adoption,” Buckberg said. ”I think [EVs] will be more resilient than people are thinking.”

The average price U.S. drivers pay for an EV has ticked slightly lower in the IRA era, from $64,700 in January 2023 to $59,900 in April, a 7.4% decline without adjusting for inflation, according to Edmunds.com. However, the range of options has widened dramatically.

When the IRA was passed, there were 34 types of EVs for sale in the U.S., with just 11 models below the average vehicle price of $47,500. Today, there are twice as many electric models to choose from, and 19 have below-average sticker prices. EV incentives in 17 states can bring the cost down even further for some buyers.

“You just have more non-luxury offerings,” Buckberg said. “You’re more likely to find the brand you want, the style you want, the size you want.”

Stephanie Valdez Streaty, a director at Cox Automotive, said carmakers and dealers are offering discounts that are often as generous or more so than government incentives. Dealer incentives on a Nissan Leaf, she said, mean “you can get that vehicle for less than $20,000” in some cases.

BNEF expects U.S. EVs will be as cheap or cheaper than gas-powered iterations by roughly 2028 (Goldman Sachs estimates that rubicon could be crossed even sooner).

There's evidence that a majority of Americans are at least electric-curious. Nearly 60% of U.S. vehicle shoppers are “very” or “somewhat” likely to purchase an EV, according to a May JD Power survey — levels unchanged from a year ago. What's more, concerns about purchase price and cost of ownership have declined over the past 12 months.

Still, the loss of federal incentives will hit the lower end of the market particularly hard. “The people who have the means to go buy a Rivian or a Lucid are still going to go do that,” said Ingrid Malmgren, the senior policy director at advocacy group Plug In America. “The impact, like so much of the rest of this bill, is inordinately going to be paid for by lower-income Americans.”

Rolling back EV tax credits is also only part of how the Trump administration is favoring internal combustion models. It has frozen a $5 billion federal plan to build charging stations, primarily along rural interstate corridors and in low-income communities. The White House has also promised to lower regulations on tailpipe emissions and moved to block a California policy to ban gasoline-powered car sales by 2035.

Factoring in all of these policy shifts will slow EVs’ momentum even further than the IRA cuts: BNEF forecasts that just 27% of the U.S. market to be electric by 2030, down from the 48% share it estimated a year ago, and Buckberg expects a similar slowdown.

Outside the U.S., however, EVs remain on a tear thanks to a drop in battery prices and a wave of low-price models rolling out of Chinese factories. BNEF expects one in four new cars sold this year — some 22 million cars and trucks — to come with a plug, a 25% increase over 2024. Two-thirds of those sales will be in China.

Buyers have until Sept. 30 to qualify for the federal tax credits on EVs before they are terminated. But experts say there are still strong financial reasons to consider buying the vehicles even without those incentives.

Before the bill passed, new electric vehicles came with a $7,500 federal tax credit, and used EVs included up to $4,000. Those incentives were originally designed to help make the vehicles more affordable. According to the latest data from Kelley Blue Book, the average purchase price of a new EV is roughly $9,000 higher in the United States than the average new gas-powered car. Used EVs on average cost $2,000 more than comparable gas cars.

Those credits, paired with other incentives in many states, helped bridge that price gap. Without them, Senior Policy Director Ingrid Malmgren of the nonprofit advocacy group Plug In America said they will become unaffordable to many lower- and middle-income Americans.

“That’s really disappointing because … they’re just a really great way to reduce transportation energy cost burden,” Malmgren said.

The up-front cost of an electric vehicle might be higher, but for those who can afford to consider the lifetime fuel and maintenance savings, Malmgren said the EV is still a good financial and environmental move in every state.

EVs are typically still cheaper to own long-term

That is because electric vehicles might not be cheaper to buy, but they are cheaper to drive. Malmgren said that even without the federal tax credits, an electric vehicle owner would still come out ahead.

“Quickly you’ll end up paying less than a gas car because it costs much less to fuel, and it needs almost nothing for maintenance,” Malmgren said.

Malmgren said the point at which an EV driver’s savings on fuel and maintenance outweigh the higher initial price varies. It depends on the kind of car and how often they are driven, as well as the cost of gasoline and electricity in an area. She said EV owners pay less in upkeep because the cars typically have fewer moving parts to maintain and require less frequent servicing. There are multiple

calculators online that pinpoint that moment based on some of those criteria.

A 2020 study in the academic journal Joule found that the average EV in the U.S. charged with a typical mix of public and private chargers saves the driver $7,700 in fuel costs over a 15-year life span, compared to filling a car with gas. Savings vary by state. The study found that someone charging a car at home during off-peak hours, deemed as a best-case scenario, could save more than $14,000 over 15 years in Washington, where electricity is relatively affordable. The study said that an EV driver in any state exhibiting typical driving and charging behavior would save money on fuel costs. The study did not account for the car’s purchase price, its maintenance cost or associated tax credits.

EVs are still cleaner, even when they charge on coal power

Manufacturing an electric vehicle typically creates more pollution than making a traditional gas-powered one. But experts say that driving an EV over the long term is still less polluting than a gas car.

Once they both drive about 15,000 miles (24,000 km) — slightly more than the average American drives in a year — the total pollution that has gone into making and driving each type of car has evened out, said Peter Slowik, U.S. Passenger Vehicles Lead for the International Council on Clean Transportation. Every mile after that widens the gap between the cleaner electric car and the more pollutive gas car. By the end of the car’s life, emissions caused by the average EV are roughly half the average gas car, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

So unless you buy a new car each year, the EV is the cleaner choice, he said.

“They are a no-brainer,” Slowik said. “Electric vehicles are already inherently so much more efficient.”

A 2023 analysis by Yale Climate Connections found that electric vehicles are responsible for less carbon dioxide pollution even in areas where the electricity used to charge them comes from coal. An EV in West Virginia, which is one of the most coal-reliant states, still pollutes 31% less than an equivalent gas-powered car, according to the analysis.

Slowik said that is because electric cars are better at translating energy into forward motion. For example, the most popular EVs in the U.S., the Tesla Model Y and the Tesla Model 3, can drive more than 100 miles (161 km) on energy equivalent to what is provided by a gallon of gasoline.

“If you compare that to a 25-mpg gasoline vehicle, that’s already four to five times more efficient,” Slowik said.

Americans for a Clean Energy Grid (ACEG) Executive Director Christina Hayes released the following statement following final passage of the Republican reconciliation bill:

“As the dust settles from the Republican reconciliation bill, ACEG and our coalition of transmission advocates urge lawmakers from both parties to come together now on pragmatic, durable solutions to upgrade and build out the electric grid. Permitting reform can and should be a bipartisan focus for members in the coming weeks and months that remain in this Congress.

“America’s transmission grid is at a crossroads. No matter your politics, the reality is clear: demand for electricity is rising. Whether that power comes from natural gas, coal, nuclear, wind, or solar, none of it will reach homes, businesses, or data centers without a modern, reliable, and expanded transmission network. As technology advances, we must ensure our grid can keep up – or risk losing America’s dominance in the global competition for advanced manufacturing and artificial intelligence.

“We remain committed to working with leaders on both sides of the aisle to find common ground and deliver the 21st-century grid that American families and businesses deserve. Transmission is not a red state or blue state issue, it’s an American security and economic imperative.”

Both will arrive before the end of the decade and be built at Volvo’s new manufacturing plant in Kosice, Slovakia.

Starting with Polestar, the brand has officially announced plans for an all-new model called the 7. It’s being billed as a premium compact crossover that will be launched in 2028.

The company isn’t saying much about the model at this point, but confirmed it will use a “technology base from Volvo Cars, benefiting from group component sharing, cell-to-body technology with next-generation battery density and performance, as well as the next generation of in-house developed e-motors.”

Despite the heavy reliance on Volvo, Polestar said there will be a number of “adaptations” to deliver the performance and driving experience the brand is known for.

That’s not a lot to go on, but the company released a teaser image that shows the crossover under a sheet. While there isn’t much to see, the model will have an upright fascia with sizable lighting units. We can also see pronounced fenders and a prominent Polestar logo.

Polestar CEO Michael Lohscheller said, “Working with Volvo Cars to develop and manufacture [the] Polestar 7 in Europe is a unique opportunity that will strengthen our position in our home market. Our strategy of utilizing Group architectures as the base for our future model lineup gives us access to the best, latest technologies, in a cost-efficient manner.”

He added the upcoming model will have sporty driving characteristics and a design that is instantly recognizable.

New Volvo Crossover Coming First

For their part, Volvo welcomed the news and confirmed the Polestar 7 will “follow a yet-to-be-announced, next-generation” model from the Swedish luxury brand. This means the mysterious Volvo should arrive before 2028, but the automaker didn’t give a timeline. However, Reuters is reporting “large-scale production” has been pushed back until early 2027.

While the company didn’t say much about their electric crossover, they confirmed the Polestar 7 will share a “common technology base with two forthcoming Volvo models, including the Volvo EX60.” It will be launched next year and ride on the new SPA3 platform, which will eventually underpin all future Volvos.

Volvo EX60

The EX60 is a mid-sized crossover and will be the first vehicle equipped with a multi-adaptive safety belt. It aims to provide better protection by “adapting to traffic variations and the person wearing it, thanks to real-time data from the car’s advanced sensors.” As part of this effort, it will factor in a person’s height, weight, body shape and seating position.

Volvo CEO Håkan Samuelsson said, “Our collaboration with Polestar on the development and manufacturing of the Polestar 7 underscores how Volvo Cars and Polestar continue to leverage synergies to efficiently deliver outstanding cars built for our distinct customer segments.” He added this “builds on the success of our joint efforts on the widely acclaimed Polestar 2 and Polestar 3.”

The Kosice plant is currently under construction and will be Volvo’s third manufacturing facility in Europe. It will cost around $1.4 (£1.0 / €1.2) billion and have an annual production capacity of up to 250,000 vehicles.",https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2028-Polestar-7.jpg,N,,2025-07-03 23:03:01.486568

The letter represented rare public criticism from agency employees who knew they could face blowback for speaking out against a weakening of funding and federal support for climate, environmental and health science.

In a statement Thursday, the EPA said it has a “zero-tolerance policy for career bureaucrats unlawfully undermining, sabotaging and undercutting” the Trump administration’s agenda.

Employees were notified that they had been placed in a “temporary, non-duty, paid status” for the next two weeks, pending an “administrative investigation,” according to a copy of the email obtained by The Associated Press. “It is important that you understand that this is not a disciplinary action,” the email read.

More than 170 EPA employees put their names to the document, with about 100 more signing anonymously out of fear of retaliation, according to Jeremy Berg, a former editor-in-chief of Science magazine who is not an EPA employee but was among non-EPA scientists or academics to also sign.

Scientists at the National Institutes of Health made a similar move in June, when nearly 100 employees signed a declaration that assailed Trump administration “policies that undermine the NIH mission, waste public resources, and harm the health of Americans and people across the globe.” An additional 250 of their colleagues endorsed the declaration without using their names.

But no one at NIH has been placed on administrative leave for signing the declaration and there has been no known retribution against them, Jenna Norton, a lead organizer of the statement, told AP on Thursday. Norton oversees health disparity research at the agency’s National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.

NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya, in his confirmation hearings, had pledged openness to views that might conflict with his own, saying dissent is the “essence of science.”

Under Administrator Lee Zeldin, EPA has cut funding for environmental improvements in minority communities, vowed to roll back federal regulations that lower air pollution in national parks and tribal reservations, wants to undo a ban on a type of asbestos and proposed repealing rules that limit planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions from power plants fueled by coal and natural gas.

Zeldin began reorganizing the EPA’s research and development office as part of his push to slash its budget and gut its study of climate change and environmental justice. And he’s seeking to roll back pollution rules that an AP examination found were estimated to save 30,000 lives and $275 billion every year.

The EPA responded to the employees’ letter earlier this week by saying policy decisions “are a result of a process where Administrator Zeldin is briefed on the latest research and science by EPA’s career professionals, and the vast majority who are consummate professionals who take pride in the work this agency does day in and day out.”

The opinion is the first of its kind from the region’s top human rights tribunal and responds to a 2023 request from Colombia and Chile. It says states have a duty under international law to prevent, mitigate and remedy environmental harm that threatens human rights, including through laws, policies and actions aimed at curbing climate change.

The court outlined a series of legal standards, including the recognition of a human right to a healthy climate, the obligation to prevent massive and irreversible environmental harm as well as the duty to protect the rights of current and future generations.

“The Court has declared that we are in a climate emergency that is undermining the human rights of present and future generations and that human rights must be at the center of any effective response,"" Nikki Reisch, program director at the Center for International Environmental Law Climate and Energy, told The Associated Press.

The opinion said states have a legal duty not only to avoid environmental harm but also to protect and restore ecosystems, guided by science and Indigenous knowledge.

“This is a historic opinion,” said Reisch. “It’s not just a legal milestone — it’s a blueprint for action. This opinion will guide climate litigation at the local, regional, and national courts, and provide a foundation for climate policymaking, grounding local legislation and global negotiations in legal obligation, not just in the Americas but around the world.”

Though not binding, the court's opinions carry legal weight in many member countries of the Organization of American States and often influence domestic legislation, judicial rulings and international advocacy. The court’s findings are expected to bolster climate-related lawsuits and human rights claims in the region, and to influence negotiations ahead of COP30 — the next major United Nations climate summit, set to take place in November in Belem, Brazil.

“States must not only refrain from causing significant environmental damage but have the positive obligation to take measures to guarantee the protection, restoration, and regeneration of ecosystems,” said Court President Judge Nancy Hernández López.

“Causing massive and irreversible environmental harm...alters the conditions for a healthy life on Earth to such an extent that it creates consequences of existential proportions. Therefore, it demands universal and effective legal responses,” López said.

The opinion comes amid growing Indigenous momentum in the region, including a summit in Ecuador’s Amazon last month where hundreds of Indigenous leaders gathered to demand enforcement of court victories recognizing their land and environmental rights.

The Inter-American Court of Human Rights, based in San Jose, Costa Rica, is the region’s top tribunal for interpreting and enforcing the American Convention on Human Rights. Its rulings, though often challenged by weak enforcement, have played a key role in advancing Indigenous rights and environmental protections across Latin America.

In recent years, the court has condemned governments for allowing mining projects on Indigenous land without proper consultation, and advocates have increasingly turned to it as a forum for climate-related accountability.

The advisory builds on the Court’s 2017 advisory ruling that recognized the right to a healthy environment as a standalone human right, deepening its application in the context of climate breakdown.

The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says Senate Republicans were employing an “accounting gimmick that would make Enron executives blush.” ___","WASHINGTON (AP) — Republicans muscled President Donald Trump’s tax and spending cut bill through the House on Thursday, the final step necessary to get the bill to his desk by the GOP’s self-imposed deadline of July 4th.

At nearly 900 pages, the legislation is a sprawling collection of tax breaks, spending cuts and other Republican priorities, including new money for national defense and deportations.

Democrats united against the legislation, but were powerless to stop it as long as Republicans stayed united. The Senate passed the bill, with Vice President JD Vance casting the tiebreaking vote. The House passed an earlier iteration of the bill in May with just one vote to spare. It passed the final version 218-214.

Here’s the latest on what’s in the bill.

Tax cuts are the priority

Republicans say the bill is crucial because there would be a massive tax increase after December when tax breaks from Trump’s first term expire. The legislation contains about $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.

The existing tax rates and brackets would become permanent under the bill, solidifying the tax cuts approved in Trump’s first term.

It temporarily would add new tax deductions on tip, overtime and auto loans. There’s also a $6,000 deduction for older adults who earn no more than $75,000 a year, a nod to his pledge to end taxes on Social Security benefits.

It would boost the $2,000 child tax credit to $2,200. Millions of families at lower income levels would not get the full credit.

A cap on state and local deductions, called SALT, would quadruple to $40,000 for five years. It’s a provision important to New York and other high tax states, though the House wanted it to last for 10 years.

There are scores of business-related tax cuts, including allowing businesses to immediately write off 100% of the cost of equipment and research. Proponents say this will boost economic growth.

The wealthiest households would see a $12,000 increase from the legislation, and the bill would cost the poorest people $1,600 a year, mainly due to reductions in Medicaid and food aid, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office analysis of the House’s version.

Money for deportations, a border wall and the Golden Dome

The bill would provide some $350 billion for Trump’s border and national security agenda, including for the U.S.-Mexico border wall and for 100,000 migrant detention facility beds, as he aims to fulfill his promise of the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history.

Money would go for hiring 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, with $10,000 signing bonuses and a surge of Border Patrol officers, as well. The goal is to deport some 1 million people per year.

To help pay for it, immigrants would face various new fees, including when seeking asylum protections.

For the Pentagon, the bill would provide billions for ship building, munitions systems, and quality of life measures for servicemen and women, as well as $25 billion for the development of the Golden Dome missile defense system. The Defense Department would have $1 billion for border security.

How to pay for it? Cuts to Medicaid and other programs

To help partly offset the lost tax revenue and new spending, Republicans aim to cut back on Medicaid and food assistance for people below the poverty line .

Republicans argue they are trying to rightsize the safety net programs for the population they were initially designed to serve, mainly pregnant women, the disabled and children, and root out what they describe as waste, fraud and abuse.

The package includes new 80-hour-a-month work requirements for many adults receiving Medicaid and food stamps, including older people up to age 65. Parents of children 14 and older would have to meet the program’s work requirements.

There’s also a proposed new $35 co-payment that can be charged to patients using Medicaid services.

More than 71 million people rely on Medicaid, which expanded under Obama’s Affordable Care Act, and 40 million use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Most already work, according to analysts.

The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 11.8 million more Americans would become uninsured by 2034 if the bill became law and 3 million more would not qualify for food stamps, also known as SNAP benefits.

Republicans are looking to have states pick up some of the cost for SNAP benefits. Currently, the federal government funds all benefit costs. Under the bill, states beginning in 2028 will be required to contribute a set percentage of those costs if their payment error rate exceeds 6%. Payment errors include both underpayments and overpayments.

But the Senate bill temporarily delays the start date of that cost-sharing for states with the highest SNAP error rates. Alaska has the highest error rate in the nation at nearly 25%, according to Department of Agriculture data. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, had fought for the exception. She was a decisive vote in getting the bill through the Senate.

A ‘death sentence’ for clean energy?

Republicans are proposing to dramatically roll back tax breaks designed to boost clean energy projects fueled by renewable sources such as energy and wind. The tax breaks were a central component of President Joe Biden’s 2022 landmark bill focused on addressing climate change and lowering health care costs.

Democratic Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden went so far as to call the GOP provisions a “death sentence for America’s wind and solar industries and an inevitable hike in utility bills.”

A tax break for people who buy new or used electric vehicles would expire on Sept. 30 of this year, instead of at the end of 2032 under current law.

Meanwhile, a tax credit for the production of critical materials will be expanded to include metallurgical coal used in steelmaking.

Trump savings accounts and so, so much more

A number of extra provisions reflect other GOP priorities.

The bill creates a new children’s savings program, called Trump Accounts, with a potential $1,000 deposit from the Treasury.

The Senate provided $40 million to establish Trump’s long-sought “National Garden of American Heroes.”

There’s a new excise tax on university endowments and a new tax on remittances, or transfers of money that people in the U.S. send abroad. The tax is equal to 1% of the transfer.

A $200 tax on gun silencers and short-barreled rifles and shotguns was eliminated.

One provision bars for one year Medicaid payments to family planning providers that provide abortions, namely Planned Parenthood.

Another section expands the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, a hard-fought provision from GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, for those impacted by nuclear development and testing.

Billions would go for the Artemis moon mission and for the exploration of Mars, while $88 million is earmarked for a pandemic response accountability committee.

Additionally, a provision would increase the nation’s debt limit, by $5 trillion, to allow continued borrowing to pay already accrued bills.

Last-minute changes

The Senate overwhelmingly revolted against a proposal meant to deter states from regulating artificial intelligence. Republican governors across the country asked for the moratorium to be removed and the Senate voted to do so with a resounding 99-1 vote.

A provision was thrown in at the final hours that will provide $10 billion annually to rural hospitals for five years, or $50 billion in total. The Senate bill had originally provided $25 billion for the program, but that number was upped to win over holdout GOP senators and a coalition of House Republicans warning that reduced Medicaid provider taxes would hurt rural hospitals.

The amended bill also stripped out a new tax on wind and solar projects that use a certain percentage of components from China.

What’s the final cost?

Altogether, the Congressional Budget Office projects that the bill would increase federal deficits over the next 10 years by nearly $3.3 trillion from 2025 to 2034.

Or not, depending on how one does the math.

Senate Republicans are proposing a unique strategy of not counting the existing tax breaks as a new cost because those breaks are already “current policy.” Republican senators say the Senate Budget Committee chairman has the authority to set the baseline for the preferred approach.

Under the alternative Senate GOP view, the bill would reduce deficits by almost half a trillion dollars over the coming decade, the CBO said.

Democrats say this is “magic math” that obscures the true costs of the tax breaks. Some nonpartisan groups worried about the country’s fiscal trajectory are siding with Democrats in that regard. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says Senate Republicans were employing an “accounting gimmick that would make Enron executives blush.”

Congress Prepares to Send Signature Bill to President's Desk for July 4th Signing

Despite House Minority Leader, Hakeem Jeffries, marathon speaking session, all indications are that Congressional Republicans have the votes to pass President Trump's signature legislative package to extend the 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, implement a handful of new consumer and business tax cuts, and increase defense and border security spending. The bill will also include cuts to spending on Medicaid and SNAP, in addition to repealing most of the clean energy tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

The bill is projected to cost $4 trillion over ten years, including higher interest payments due to increased deficits. Federal deficits are expected to stay around 7% of GDP through the next decade, about 1 percentage-point above previous estimates. Federal debt as a percentage of GDP is now anticipated to grow from 100% in 2025 to 125% by 2034, relative to 117% before the OBBB was passed.

The expected increase in federal debt issuance has resulted in some upward pressure on U.S. Treasury yields in recent months, driven by a rising term premium. U.S. Treasury yield movements this week have been constrained overall, but with a holiday shortened week, weaker pricing may yet emerge in the days ahead.

The economic impact of the bill is expected to be modest, as the largest provision simply extended existing tax policies that no longer carry an economic multiplier. Overall, the bill is expected to raise real GDP by roughly half a percentage point over the next ten years, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). However, this is likely to be front-loaded in the first few years owing to new spending on defense and border security.

The bill will also raise the debt ceiling by $5 trillion, offering over two years of fiscal capacity for the U.S. Treasury and eliminating the immediate risk of default. The government hit the debt ceiling back in January, requiring the Treasury Department to implement extraordinary measures to maintain operations, which were projected to run out by early September.

Key Implications

Net new initiatives from the OBBB remain consistent with our June forecast update, where we already incorporated a lift to GDP growth of 0.2 percentage points for each of the next two years from the near-term spending initiatives.

On the flip side, this “growth enhancer” comes at a sharp fiscal cost. A deficit running at 7% of GDP would historically only occur during recessions.

Ordinarily this should ring alarm bells in financial markets, but investors are likely considering the partial offset to the deficit impact that could be provided by tariff revenues.

In particular, the Congressional Budget Office estimated last month that tariffs currently in effect would raise just under $3 trillion in new revenues over the coming decade, net of the negative economic impacts. Year-to-date, tariff revenues have accumulated $97 billion, including June revenues estimated to be roughly $28 billion.

Even if this revenue stream were to be sustained as a spending offset, that would leave deficits running at around 6-6.5% of GDP – still an unsustainable trend. Any hiccup in economic growth over the next decade would place U.S. finances at further risk.

The fiscal responsibility can has been kicked down the road for now. However, the steady rise in interest costs means the necessary deficit adjustment will eventually carry a higher economic cost in spending cuts and/or additional revenues from new or existing sources.

Higher economic growth could aid in restraining debt growth, but this should not be solely relied upon as the way forward. Balancing the budget from economic growth alone would require sustained nominal GDP growth of 6-7%, which is well above the average of 4% over the past decade.

House Republicans passed the massive spending bill that slashes solar, wind, and EV tax credits.

The bill quickly sunsets incentives that Congress approved in 2022 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act that was expected to cut US greenhouse gas emissions by roughly 40 percent from peak levels by 2030. On top of more pollution, wholesale electricity prices could also increase by 25 percent by 2030 as a result of the bill, according to one initial analysis

The bill now heads to President Donald Trump to sign into law.

Solar farms, for example, can typically be completed in 12 to 18 months, whereas backlogs for new natural gas turbines stretches into the early 2030s.

Nutrient pollution Nitrogen and phosphorus are nutrients often found in things like fertilizer for agriculture or a product of wastewater treatment.
Other sources of pollution, called “nonpoint source” pollution, like that from farming fertilizer runoff, do not have any requirement to limit nutrient pollution in Louisiana.
LDEQ also does a water quality assessment every two years to see if bodies of water are “supporting” or “not supporting” the narrative requirements.
Even with the problems in Louisiana’s program, environmental advocates and scientists alike agree that trying a market strategy to control nutrient pollution isn’t a baseless idea.","Imagine you love cherry cheesecake, and you’re happy to find out that your local bakery makes the delicious, decadent dessert every Saturday. But they only make a certain amount per week; after that, there’s no more.

Your neighbors also love cherry cheesecake. So, in order to get more for yourself from the limited supply, you pay them not to order a cake on Saturday, giving their share to you instead.

Balancing the amount of cheesecake consumption using this kind of trade works in a similar way to water quality trading, which looks to reduce pollution in the environment— in theory. It gets a lot more complicated than cheesecake.

“One entity removes certain pollutants from the environment, and then a company that discharges that pollutant could buy those credits to offset their pollution,” said Matt Rota, senior policy director for environmental group Healthy Gulf.

The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) hopes to improve water quality throughout the state with a new water quality trading program, using a market-based strategy to encourage less nitrogen and phosphorus pollution in waterways.

It’s a type of plan that environmentalists, scientists and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) says can be a useful tool. But whether the program is fully set up for success isn’t yet certain.

Nutrient pollution

Nitrogen and phosphorus are nutrients often found in things like fertilizer for agriculture or a product of wastewater treatment. Farmers, wastewater treatment companies and other types of facilities produce nitrogen and phosphorus as a byproduct; that byproduct often gets washed or dumped into nearby waterways.

Too much nitrogen and phosphorus in the water can cause toxic algae blooms, areas of low oxygen also known as dead-zone and acidification of coastal estuaries and wetlands, among other problems

The dead zone in the upper Gulf of Mexico, now renamed the Gulf of America by the Trump administration, is the “poster child” for the issue, said Rota. The area of low oxygen that appears every summer in the Gulf from nutrient pollution in the Mississippi River covers an area usually about the size of Delaware.

“It’s a really important issue, the zone of hypoxia,” said John Sabo, professor at Tulane’s Department of River-Coastal Science and Engineering, and director of the Tulane ByWater Institute. Low oxygen in the water can kill fish, shrimp and other sea life, affecting Louisiana’s seafood industry and the ecology of the Gulf.

Previous efforts to reduce it haven’t made much progress. Vast amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus wash into the Mississippi River from further North in the Mississippi River Basin. All of that runs down to Louisiana, making it hard to control that much pollution within a single state.

The Hypoxia Task Force, a group of federal agencies, states and tribes throughout the Basin, represents one of the larger groups trying to address the dead zone by forecasting and mapping the annual size of the zone. It also works with farmers to adopt new strategies to reduce the amount of nutrient runoff from agricultural fields and works with universities and businesses to advance technology to contain nutrient runoff.

The goal of the Task Force is to reduce the dead zone’s size by 20 percent of what it was in 2015 by this year, and no larger than about 1,900 square miles by 2035. Forecasts for this year predict the zone to be about 4,800 square miles.

Problems with fully funding the annual cruise to gather data on the true size of the zone could also make it harder to tell whether reduction strategies are working.

Problems in the program

The idea behind LDEQ’s market strategy is that Louisiana can use financial incentives to reduce nutrient pollution and help alleviate problems like the dead zone.

“The goal is to reduce pollutants across the state,” said Rachel Mathews, LDEQ environmental scientist manager and the program lead for the water quality trading initiative.

But environmental advocates noted some gaps that could hinder the program’s success.

Louisiana doesn’t currently have numeric limits for nutrient pollution in waterways. Having a specific, measurable number is important for keeping a market working correctly, according to Rota and Sabo.

Certain individual permits from “point source” polluters, or places like wastewater treatment plants and manufacturing facilities, might have a measurable maximum they are allowed to dump, but Louisiana has no broad, standard requirement for these facilities to limit nutrient pollution.

Other sources of pollution, called “nonpoint source” pollution, like that from farming fertilizer runoff, do not have any requirement to limit nutrient pollution in Louisiana.

“If their permits aren’t requiring them to ramp down their nitrogen or phosphorus discharge, there’s no market,” said Rota.“Louisiana hasn’t put together a good regulatory regime to ensure that these credits would need to be purchased.”

It’s like the local bakery making cheesecake all week in unlimited amounts; there’s no incentive to pay your neighbor not to get a cake if you can eat as much as you want.

Louisiana started the process of developing numeric maximums for the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus allowed in bodies of water in 2003, mutually agreeing with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to finish a draft of nutrient criteria for all waterways except the Mississippi and Atchafalaya rivers by 2013. Rota said that goal still hasn’t been met.

“Louisiana has theoretically been working on those for 20 years. And, you know, we have seen very little progress,” said Rota.

Mathews said Louisiana does follow a “general narrative criteria,” or more qualitative descriptions like good, bad, moderate or severe, for maintaining the amount of nutrient pollution in the state’s waters.

“It’s a good start, the narrative approach, but it should be evolved towards quantitative and measurement,” said Sabo.

LDEQ also does a water quality assessment every two years to see if bodies of water are “supporting” or “not supporting” the narrative requirements. Mathews said that can help LDEQ decide if certain, more heavily polluted areas need to be a higher priority for cleanup.

“It was just the most efficient tool that we had available at the time,” said Mathews.

But relying on numbers is central to making a program like this successful. A report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office looking at water quality trading programs found that without limits on the amount of nutrients allowed into waterways, there’s no demand for point source polluters to buy credits.

Getting nonpoint source polluters involved was another issue the report cited, because it’s so difficult to tell how much nutrient pollution they actually produce, creating “uncertainties about the value of credits.”

Can it be fixed?

Even with the problems in Louisiana’s program, environmental advocates and scientists alike agree that trying a market strategy to control nutrient pollution isn’t a baseless idea.

“I love working with the market rather than against it,” said Cassie Glaspie, assistant professor in Louisiana State University’s Department of Oceanography & Coastal Sciences.

Still, she said there’s a need for regulation to play a role.

“I usually get excited about these types of things, but I also know from experience that regulation has to be part of the talk,” she said. “Having some sort of nutrient pollution credit, I think, would be an important tool to help that, but it’s not going to solve the issue on its own.”

Sabo said that expanding from a program solely in Louisiana to one encompassing more states in the Mississippi River Basin could be a good way to start making actual, substantial impacts in reducing problems like the dead zone.

“Starting at home makes a lot of sense, because you can’t incentivize market participation between Iowa and Louisiana very easily, but if you have your own market set up, that’s a good pilot for something larger,” said Sabo.

While Mathews didn’t expand on specific plans for future expansion into the Basin, she emphasised the importance of Louisiana trying new and varied ways to tackle the overwhelming problem of nutrient pollution.

“Who knows where we’re gonna go from here? We just have to get one thing done before we can move to anything else,” said Mathews.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/dead-zone-research-cruise-noaa.jpg,N,,2025-07-03 21:04:58.682339

""This project is crucial for grid reliability, unlocking access to affordable renewable energy and delivering billions in benefits from lower carbon emissions.""","SPRINGFIELD, IL. (July 2, 2025) – Today the Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC) granted final approval of Ameren Transmission Company of Illinois (ATXI) and Ameren Illinois’s Central Illinois Grid Transformation Program. The program is a landmark effort to modernize and expand Illinois’ energy grid with 380 miles of new and expanded transmission lines, a vast majority of which will be rebuilt along existing corridors and co-located with existing facilities. Clean Grid Alliance (CGA), Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), and Illinois Citizens Utility Board (CUB) celebrated the decision, which will enable the delivery of affordable, reliable energy across the state.

The ICC approved the certificate of public convenience and necessity for the 380-mile program that will connect the energy grid across Illinois from Indiana to Iowa and Missouri, improving reliability and enabling access to low-cost renewable energy resources. The program is a significant part of the Midcontinent Independent System Operator’s (MISO) Long-Range Transmission Plan (LRTP) Tranche 1 project that spans across the Upper Midwest, and it is expected to provide up to $2.8 billion in financial benefits for the state of Illinois over the next 20 years.

“Infrastructure projects like the Central Illinois Grid Transformation Program are critical to ensuring low-cost, reliable energy can flow freely across the region,” said Elizabeth Wheeler, Senior Counsel and Director of Regulatory Advocacy at Clean Grid Alliance. “Modernizing our electric grid with new and upgraded transmission lines is absolutely necessary to support a secure economic future for Illinois.”

""The Central Illinois Grid Transformation Program will deliver a more reliable, affordable energy future for Illinois residents,"" said Curt Stokes, Senior Attorney at Environmental Defense Fund.

“We thank the Illinois Commerce Commission for approving this transmission program, which will help advance Illinois' goal of securing clean and affordable energy for its residents,"" said Jim Chilsen, Communications Director of the Citizens Utility Board. “Smart, cost-effective transmission planning is critical to the clean energy transition, and an absolute must to help Illinois achieve a clean, affordable energy future for all electric customers.”

The Tranche 1 portfolio of LRTP projects was approved by MISO in July, 2022 to provide $37 billion in regional economic benefits over 20 years and improve grid reliability and integration of new, low-cost renewable energy resources. As ""least-regrets"" projects, the Tranche 1 transmission lines are foundational to solving long-standing reliability and efficiency concerns along the regional electricity grid.",https://www.edf.org/themes/edf2020/favicons/favicon-96x96.png,N,,2025-07-04 01:04:36.317730

In a letter made public Monday, the employees wrote that the agency is no longer living up to its mission to protect human health and the environment. The letter represented rare public criticism from agency employees who knew they could face blowback for speaking out against a weakening of funding and federal support for climate, environmental and health science.

In a statement Thursday, the EPA said it has a “zero-tolerance policy for career bureaucrats unlawfully undermining, sabotaging and undercutting” the Trump administration’s agenda.

Employees were notified that they had been placed in a “temporary, non-duty, paid status” for the next two weeks, pending an “administrative investigation”, according to a copy of the email obtained by the Associated Press. “It is important that you understand that this is not a disciplinary action,” the email reads.

More than 170 EPA employees put their names on the document, with about 100 more signing anonymously out of fear of retaliation, according to Jeremy Berg, a former editor in chief of Science magazine who is not an EPA employee but was among non-EPA scientists or academics to also sign.

Scientists at the National Institutes of Health made a similar move earlier in June, but Berg said he was unaware of anyone at the NIH who had been placed on similar administrative leave.

Under administrator Lee Zeldin, the EPA has cut funding for environmental improvements in minority communities, vowed to roll back federal regulations that lower air pollution in national parks and on tribal reservations, proposed to undo a ban on a type of asbestos and proposed repealing rules that limit planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions from power plants fueled by coal and natural gas.

Zeldin began reorganizing the EPA’s research and development office as part of his push to slash its budget and gut its study of climate change and environmental justice. He’s also seeking to roll back pollution rules that an AP examination found were estimated to save 30,000 lives and $275bn every year.

The EPA responded to the employees’ letter earlier this week by saying policy decisions “are a result of a process where Administrator Zeldin is briefed on the latest research and science by EPA’s career professionals, and the vast majority who are consummate professionals who take pride in the work this agency does day in and day out”.",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8342e26d116d8c1a14789c0425aedc7002c1505d/257_0_2000_1601/master/2000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ba0ccb568f310df3b3d4d567d9482d82,N,,2025-07-03 21:04:22.406209
