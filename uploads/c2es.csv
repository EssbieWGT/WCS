The United States is hopelessly broken, with red states and blue states at each other’s throats more and more. Not since the Civil War has the country been so divided, with one half of states determined to promote an inclusive society that honors the contributions of all citizens and the other half equally determined to construct a white male dominated society that punishes anyone who lost the lottery of life at birth or prays to the wrong god.

About the only branch of government that still functions as the Founders envisioned is the court system, and even that has been badly compromised by a slew of MAGA judges who are sworn to uphold the madness of King Donald, no matter what the law says. Today we have liberty and justice for white males and prison or deportation for everyone else.

Reuters reports that nearly two dozen states are now suing the administration over its cancellation of the $7 billion Solar For All grants meant to expand access to solar energy in low-income communities. It was also intended to expand community solar initiatives, which bring solar power to people who don’t own their own homes or otherwise can’t install their own solar panels.

The program was projected to help 900,000 households access solar energy so they could reduce their use of fossil fuels and lower their utility bills. The participating households were expected to collectively save more than $350 million each year on utility costs. Of course, the savings would come from burning less methane and coal, and we can’t have that, not when the federal government is a wholly owned subsidiary of the fossil fuel industry.

The majority of those 900,000 households were located in so-called red states, so you might think the Solar For All program would be welcome across the country. Not so. It turns out that while the federal government is shoveling $90 billion to a handful of tech billionaires to help them build data centers, the idea of helping low- and moderate-income Americans is too horrifying for MAGAlomaniacs to even contemplate. So the EPA — led by presidential jock sniffer Lee Zeldin — is planning to claw back the $7 billion promised by the Solar For All initiative. We’ve got to find the money for those tech bros somewhere, after all.

On October 16, 2025, California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced two lawsuits by a group of states that were previously approved grants under the Solar for All program. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the termination of the program in August, calling it a “boondoggle.” [But apparently propping up a dictator in Argentina with 40 billion taxpayer dollars is not. Lying is all these people know.]

California will lose around $250 million in funding approved by Congress for the Solar For All program. “The administration is trying to hold us in the past, tethered to fossil fuel companies. In doing so, [it] is making America more expensive and more polluted,” Bonta said.

Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said cancellation of the program would impact 11,000 households in Arizona and cause their utility bills to jump by 20 percent after the state lost $156 million in Solar for All funding. “Without this program, for many Arizonans, clean energy will be out of reach,” Mayes said.

She added that cancellation of the program would hit disadvantaged communities the hardest, citing the Hopi tribe of northern Arizona which was slated to get a $25 million award to bring electricity to the community. For many tribal members, it would be the first time ever that they had electricity in their homes.

The complaints were filed 10 days after a group of solar companies and labor unions sued to restore the Solar For All program. In addition to California and Arizona, states participating in the lawsuits include Maryland, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, and the city of Washington, D.C.

Federal Judge In Louisiana Tosses LNG Terminal Permit

In other court related news of interest to CleanTechnica readers, Jack Brook of The Hill reported on October 16, 2025 that Judge Penelope Richard of Louisiana state court has invalidated a key permit for a liquefied natural gas facility in Cameron Parish that was approved by the administration earlier this year. The ruling ordered the state to review how planet-warming emissions from the LNG facility would affect Gulf Coast communities that are vulnerable to sea level rise and extreme weather. Three of America’s eight existing LNG export terminals are located in Cameron Parish, and several more are proposed or under construction there.

“Cameron Parish is ground zero for the relentless expansion of the gas export industry,” said Anne Rolfes, founder of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, an environmental group involved in the litigation. “We’re going to stop it and this is an important step in that process.” Clay Garside, an attorney representing the Sierra Club and other environmental groups, added, “This is the first time any court has vacated a permit for a Commonwealth LNG facility based on the government’s refusal to consider climate change impacts.”

Earlier this year, energy secretary Chris “Mad Dog” Wright reversed a Biden-era pause on exports of LNG as part of his goal to boost natural gas exports and promote US “energy dominance.” Jennifer Granholm, who served as Biden’s energy secretary, had warned a year ago that “unfettered exports” of liquefied natural gas would lead to a dangerous increase in greenhouse gas emissions.

Lyle Hanna, a Commonwealth LNG spokesperson, said “we are disappointed with the District Court’s decision, and we are exploring all available legal options.” Louisiana’s attorney general Liz Murrill sputtered and fumed while vowing to appeal the decision that vacated the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy’s coastal use permit for the facility. “Sadly even state court judges are not immune from climate activism,” Murrill said.

Last year, a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C. ordered the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to reassess Commonwealth LNG’s air pollution, including its greenhouse gas emissions. In June, the commission gave the project a greenlight on the grounds that its construction was in the public interest. In regulatory filings, the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy said that “climate change is currently beyond the scope” of the state’s regulatory review.

But Judge Richard rejected that position, ruling that state environmental regulators have a duty to consider how the LNG facility, along with other similar facilities clustered nearby, would impact extreme weather events, storm severity, and sea-level rise in a state where land area equivalent to a football field disappears every 100 minutes.

Richard also ordered state regulators to analyze the facility’s impacts on local communities, especially those living in poverty or relying on fishing for their livelihoods — “defining characteristic” of the parish, she said. The LNG terminal could destroy marshes, harm water quality, and displace residents, but “none of it was considered in terms of impacts on environmental justice communities,” the judge wrote in her decision.

Commercial fisherman Eddie LeJuine, a lifelong Cameron Parish resident, told The Hill he applauded the ruling. He said the buildout of LNG infrastructure, including dredging for shipping channels, has significantly harmed the fishing industry. “The fishermen are barely hanging on with a thread,” LeJuine said. “These plants are killing the estuary and killing our livelihoods. We’re getting extinct.” Local fishermen like LeJuine say the onslaught of saltwater and sediment will kill off large amounts of oysters, crabs, and fish.

How long do you think will be before some higher court in Louisiana — the most polluted state in the US — overturns Judge Richard’s decision? A week? A month? You can bet it won’t take long as Louisiana continues to throw its citizens under the bus to please the oil and gas industries.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/solar-wap-liheap-body-e1719446207618.jpg,N,,2025-10-19 01:03:58.972722

Their concerns congregate around worries that the clean power transition will not treat oil and gas, and other industrial workers fairly.
By laying out a clear four year strategy for clean power jobs, the Energy Secretary hopes to assuage those concerns.
Clean Power companies have grown under the government’s renewed charge towards green energy: this stipulation in Miliband’s Clean Power Jobs plan will encourage them to give back.
Indeed, GMB has looked favourably on Miliband’s new Clean Jobs Plan.","After a punchy party conference, Ed Miliband is still running on a high. The Energy Secretary, whose clean power plans are often a target for right-wing ire, has now managed to win over some of his fiercest critics: the unions.

Today the government has unveiled the UK’s first ever national clean jobs plan. With this long-awaited strategy, the government hopes to create 400,000 extra jobs in 31 priority occupations such as plumbers, electricians and wielders. If everything goes to plan, under Miliband’s new scheme, by 2030, employment is expected to double to 860,000. Oil and gas workers – who are often held up as the so-called victims of the Green Transition – will benefit from up to £20m in total from the UK and Scottish Governments to fund bespoke careers training.

But more interestingly, this plan signals a clear leftward shift from Miliband (who is often held up as a vanguard of the ‘soft-left’ in the cabinet). The plan also includes several key employment rights measures that trade unions have long been calling for. And as a result, it has been enthusiastically backed by some of net zero’s loudest critics within the trade union movement, including representatives from GMB, Unite, Prospect, Community and a raft of others. Their concerns congregate around worries that the clean power transition will not treat oil and gas, and other industrial workers fairly. By laying out a clear four year strategy for clean power jobs, the Energy Secretary hopes to assuage those concerns.

As part of the offer to the unions, the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero will close the current loophole in employment rights legislation which means that those working further than 12 miles offshore do not benefit from the full raft of workers’ rights. This will provide serious benefits for those working in offshore wind and is intended to help attract more people to the sector.

The department will also set up new fair work charters which stipulate that if a clean power company (in offshore wind, or solar power, for example) wants to take up the government’s clean energy bonus, they must be able to provide clear evidence that they have good industrial relations and have a recognised union for employees. Clean Power companies have grown under the government’s renewed charge towards green energy: this stipulation in Miliband’s Clean Power Jobs plan will encourage them to give back.

Miliband described this as a “landmark national plan” and added that he hopes the government’s new measures will mean “if we get this right, we will create an economy where there is no need to leave your hometown to find a decent job”. Sources close to the Energy Secretary told the New Statesman that this is crucial to taking the fight to Reform. (Richard Tice, Reform’s deputy leader, is often heard in the Commons describing the government’s plans as “net stupid zero”). By focusing heavily on maintaining good industrial relations – especially on clean power – the government hopes to expose Reform’s double-standards and its unsustainable plans for British workers. Under the government’s logic, Reform would allow business as usual and continued drilling, despite the fact that in 2024, less than half of the UK’s oil and gas came from the North Sea. In fact, by 2027, it is estimated that the UK will be 95 per cent reliant on imported fossil fuels.

This flagship strategy comes at a particularly testy time for Labour politically. Recent polling for next week’s Caerphilly by-election has put Labour on 12 per cent well behind Reform and Plaid Cymru (42 per cent and 38 per cent respectively). Reform’s campaigning in Wales – which commenced with Nigel Farage’s press conference in June – has included pledges to reopen the coal mines, in direct contravention of Miliband’s clean power vision.

“Reform are campaigning on de-industrialisation, and re-opening the pits,” a source close to the Energy Secretary said, “we see what they’re doing in Wales.” They described the Clean Jobs Plan as a recognition from the government that more needs to be done to bring the unions along with this mission. “Ed is doing very bold stuff: he’s basically saying, you only get public money if you recognise the unions”. Some in the clean energy world have described this move as “class conscious environmentalism”.

This is all part of a realignment of Miliband’s relationship with the unions, hints of which were very clear at the Labour Party conference at the end of September. At a Climate Jobs Alliance drinks reception in Liverpool, Miliband and GMB’s general secretary, Gary Smith, signalled their new, clear alliance. Smith, who has been a fierce critic of Net Zero, told the reception “we know that working class communities are impacted first by the climate crisis”, after which Miliband gave him an avocado as an apparent “sign of their growing bond”. Indeed, GMB has looked favourably on Miliband’s new Clean Jobs Plan.

Charlotte Brumpton-Childs, national officer at GMB told the New Statesman, “GMB welcomes this roadmap for clean energy jobs and the cast iron expectation unions, and their members will be at the heart of this.” Even Unite’s Sharon Graham – a long standing and vocal critic of Miliband’s net zero mission – is on board. She said, “Unite members will welcome the commitment to 400,000 green jobs with strong collective bargaining rights,” but cautioned, “the actions set out in this plan are initial steps in what must be an ambitious strategy for tangible jobs, backed by an equally ambitious programme of public investment.”

This is clearly a powerful move by Miliband, and it proves his resilience as a cabinet minister in a particularly turbulent Labour government. Ahead of the Spending Review earlier this year, a raft of negative briefings suggested that Clean Power 2030 could be scaled back. Instead, Miliband’s department was one of the biggest winners.

After September’s reshuffle, rumours emerged that Miliband was almost demoted to Housing Secretary (the post which Steve Reed now inhabits). Instead, he stayed firm. This plan is a clear leftward signal from the Energy Secretary at a time when this government’s direction is under clear scrutiny (Miliband has backed Powell in Labour’s Deputy Leadership race which has been viewed by some as a referendum on the government’s political alignment). Could this be a signal from the Energy Secretary that in order to win the battle with Reform, Labour must return to its roots?",https://dl6pgk4f88hky.cloudfront.net/2025/10/18/gettyimages-2185394124-800x418.jpg?1760839207,N,,2025-10-18 23:04:19.825649

Without doubt, it is within a business’ best interest to incorporate sustainable commuting options into their ESG strategy.","Sustainable travel options for colleagues are not only good for the environment, they make good business sense too, writes Patrizia Niehaus.

As the leaves fall and the crisp morning air brushes against our cheeks, there is no mistaking it: October is here. By this stage, the schools are back in action, colleges and universities are open, and those long-awaited summer holidays are well and truly behind us.

If you listen carefully, you can almost hear the collective groan of commuters across the country, stranded in bumper-to-bumper traffic, gritting their teeth and glancing at their watches as precious minutes slip away. Rush hour has returned and with it comes more congestion, more frustration and more emissions.

“Without doubt, it is within a business’ best interest to incorporate sustainable commuting options into their ESG strategy”

In fact, the daily commute is one of the biggest contributors to traffic congestion. With over 3 million cars on our roads, and 59% of people driving to work every day, it’s no wonder the Environmental Protection Agency found that transport emissions represent the greatest overall increase in GHG emissions of any sector – rising by 129% in the last 30 years.

The reality is everybody has a role to play in reducing Ireland’s emissions and often, it’s the small steps that can lead to meaningful change. However, when considering the commute, it could be argued that businesses have a bigger influence, or more accurately a bigger opportunity, to make a real impact. After all, what is one of the main reasons the daily commute exists? People have to get to work.

The toll of travel

This realisation has not gone unnoticed with companies across the globe now facing increased pressure to disclose their ESG data. And while reporting platforms are incredibly helpful in streamlining data and ensuring compliance, they cannot create metrics out of thin air.

Businesses have a responsibility to measure and manage their emissions, including those caused by the daily commute of their employees. These emissions fall under the notoriously difficult to track and address, scope three category.

As well as higher levels of pollution, according to our own research here at KINTO Join, commuting can also have a negative impact on people’s mental health.

In fact, 45% of Irish people find their daily commute stressful. It comes as no surprise that the top frustration among commuters in Ireland is traffic congestion. In turn, those travelling by car could find a once 20-minute journey taking over an hour and a once half-empty carpark jammed with queues.

Without question, the daily commute inflicts some form of misery on employees’ lives – whether it be environmentally, physically or mentally.

Unfortunately, for many, there is no other choice than to jump in the car to get to where they need to go. However, companies do have a choice when it comes to enabling sustainable commuting for employees.

Go on green!

So, what happens if businesses decide to shift gears and embrace sustainable commuting options? Much like the challenges of commuting, the advantages are endless.

By incentivising public transport, implementing low-cost shuttle options and/or utilising carpooling apps, businesses have the ability to help reduce emissions – in some cases, saving hundreds of kilogrammes of CO2. They also have the power to enhance the commuting experience for employees.

This not only benefits people and the environment, but also the business. In general, happier staff are more productive. In turn, there is likely to be less turnover and higher retention. In fact, almost two-thirds of commuters we surveyed acknowledged they are more likely to stay in a job with more favourable commuting options.

These are all additional benefits that don’t even consider the core advantage – playing a part in reducing transport emissions, helping Ireland to meet its mandated EU climate targets and ultimately protecting our planet against climate change for generations to come.

Without doubt, it is within a business’ best interest to incorporate sustainable commuting options into their ESG strategy. It is no longer simply an environmental choice; it’s a strategic investment in both the wellbeing of a company’s workforce and the future of the organisation.",https://www.thinkbusiness.ie/app/uploads/2025/10/sustainable-travel.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 23:04:36.880335

""This decision will raise energy prices and slow the growth of the solar energy we need to fill demand, which is at an all-time high,"" said executive director Jason Walsh.
The plaintiffs are challenging that the administration violated federal law by rescinding ""congressionally obligated funds"" — funds already approved by Congress.","The Solar for All program, launched on Earth Day in 2024, was set to bring cleaner, more affordable energy to nearly a million low-income and disadvantaged households. But its promise was cut short when the $7 billion grant initiative was canceled following the passage of the Big Beautiful Bill. Now, close to two dozen states are suing the Trump administration, according to Reuters.

As of October 16, Democratic attorneys general from more than 20 states and Washington, D.C, have filed two lawsuits in response to the program closure. This comes after Lee Zeldin, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, announced the termination of Solar for All in August, shortly after the funds were briefly unfrozen.

The initiative had been funded through the Inflation Reduction Act, passed under the previous administration, and it was intended to enable the installation of solar panels in communities across the country. But the project was designed to support more than just the clean energy transition away from polluting energy sources — its aims also included more resilient power grids, increased U.S. energy independence, a boost for local economies, and lower household electricity costs.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta said his state will lose about $250 million in federal funds, according to Reuters, while Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said her state's loss of $156 million would cause energy bills for more than 11,000 Arizona families to go up by 20 percent. Mayes also noted that marginalized communities in Northern Arizona, such as the Hopi Tribe, have lost a $25 million award to bring electricity and battery storage to hundreds of homes — some of which have never been connected to the grid.

""The Trump administration is trying to hold us in the past, tethered to fossil fuel companies,"" Bonta said in a call cited by Reuters. ""In doing so, Trump is making America more expensive and more polluted.""

According to a 2024 news release issued under the previous administration, the Solar for All grants were designed to improve equitable access to solar energy in order to advance environmental justice and save more than 900,000 American households $350 million annually. In fact, with tens of thousands of U.S. residents lacking safe and consistent access to electricity at home, the program was set to improve equitable access in general.

Job creation was envisioned as another benefit of Solar for All. Following its termination, the BlueGreen Alliance, a coalition of labor unions advocating for green jobs, released a statement saying the move is an attack on working families. ""This decision will raise energy prices and slow the growth of the solar energy we need to fill demand, which is at an all-time high,"" said executive director Jason Walsh.

The AGs' lawsuits are seeking both monetary damages and reinstatement of the program. The plaintiffs are challenging that the administration violated federal law by rescinding ""congressionally obligated funds"" — funds already approved by Congress. A group of unions, nonprofits, and homeowners has also separately sued the administration for the program termination.

While a legal battle over vast sums may ensue, some states, cities, and homeowners have already been taking matters into their own hands. Some residents have been able to leverage more local funding and make at-home panel installation happen. Others are signing up for community solar programs to save money and reduce their environmental footprints.

Communities are coming together in other ways too. For example, in Maine — which happens to be one of the states involved in the lawsuits — the Center for an Ecology-Based Economy has been hosting monthly ""energy cafés"" so locals can get together to learn about home solar and other cleaner, more affordable energy options.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/white-house-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 21:03:37.600168

Connecticut was granted $62.45 million from EPA in 2024, but in August, $62 million was allegedly liquidated from the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection’s account, according to Tong’s office.

On Aug. 7, Zeldin announced the termination of the Solar for All program in a video posted to social media.

“EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program,” Zeldin said. “With clear language and intent from Congress in the One Big Beautiful Bill, EPA is taking action to end this program for good.”

H.R. 1, better known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, contained language that would rescind Solar for All funds that were not legally allocated as of July 3, 2025. Tong says, though, that Connecticut should not have felt much of an impact, as the EPA obligated all $7 billion for the program in 2024.

“Congress created the Solar for All program, and EPA awarded these funds so that Connecticut could help low-income residents save millions of dollars on their energy bills. Trump cannot unilaterally reverse course now, and we’re suing to make sure Connecticut gets every penny we are owed,” Tong said in a press release.

Another billionaire has entered the electric vehicle market. Jeff Bezos is funding a startup called Slate Auto, which plans to launch a “radically affordable” EV pickup truck — priced at around $25,000 — as early as next year, according to TechCrunch.

The company will offer just one model — a compact, two-door electric truck. But with its low price and modular design, Slate could appeal to budget-conscious drivers looking for a no-frills alternative to high-end EVs.

So how does Bezos’ truck compare to Elon Musk’s Tesla Cybertruck?

Price Comparison: Slate vs. Cybertruck

According to the Slate Auto website, its signature truck is expected to be priced around $25,000.

The Tesla Cybertruck, on the other hand, starts at $72,490 for the all-wheel drive model and $114,990 for the Cyberbeast model.

That’s a difference of nearly $50,000 to $90,000, depending on the Cybertruck model, making the Slate the far more affordable choice.

Features and Range: Minimalism vs. Luxury

While the Cybertruck is packed with futuristic high-end features, Slate takes a minimalist approach to keep costs low.

Slate EV Truck

Range: 150 miles (standard), up to 240 miles with extended battery

Customization: Can be converted into a five-seat SUV, open-air vehicle or cargo truck

Interior: No infotainment system, no Bluetooth

Add-ons: Power window, heated seats, color wraps and more are available for extra cost

Tesla Cybertruck

Range: 320 to 325 miles, depending on model

Interior: Dual touchscreens, ambient lighting, 15 premium speakers

Tech: Advanced autopilot features

Who Is the Slate Truck For?

With its ultra-low price and basic build, Slate is targeting a niche audience — those who care about function over flair and affordability over luxury.

“There’s nothing wrong with trying to crack the affordability crisis, but I don’t see this as a massive volume seller,” Erin Keating, executive analyst at Cox Automotive, told The New York Times. “Ultimately, this is an extremely small EV with almost nothing in it, in a market with a growing number of affordable choices with much longer range.”

There likely won’t be much overlap between customers who would buy a Slate and those who would buy a Cybertruck. However, for buyers who want an EV truck without the luxury price tag, the Bezos-backed Slate could be a game-changer",https://cdn.gobankingrates.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Blank-Slate-and-SUV.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 21:03:41.696610

From deadly floods that claimed dozens of lives to mounting U.S. pressure on Mexican politicians, the period between October 13 and 17 highlighted the complex issues confronting President Claudia Sheinbaum’s administration. Meanwhile, business milestones, a controversial legal reform, cultural celebrations and environmental initiatives offered a window into the country’s progress and resilience.

Didn’t have time to read every story this week? Here’s what you missed.

Natural disasters devastate Mexican communities

This week marked the first stage of recovery after catastrophic flooding ravaged five central and eastern states. By week’s end, the death toll had climbed to 72 people with 48 officially declared missing, while 127 towns remained virtually inaccessible. Veracruz bore the brunt with 32 deaths, followed by Hidalgo with 21 and Puebla with 18.

The government unveiled a tracking website showing 12,350 emergency responders deployed with 30 helicopters and 681 heavy machinery units. At Friday’s press conference, Sheinbaum praised the “heroism” of approximately 52,000 federal and state workers responding to the crisis. However, she faced criticism from angry residents during a visit to Poza Rica in Veracruz, where fetid water remained ankle-deep and concerns about typhoid and cholera spread. Veracruz Governor Rocío Nahle drew particular criticism after reports emerged that she had canceled the state’s natural disaster insurance policy.

Puerto Vallarta experienced its own crisis when a nine-hour storm flooded more than 1,000 homes, claiming one life. The city also mourned the sinking of the Marigalante pirate ship following a bilge pump failure.

Business and economic developments

Mexico achieved a significant milestone, becoming the leading exporter of electric vehicles to the United States, exporting approximately 145,000 EVs last year and surpassing Japan and South Korea. Production through September 2025 reached 214,203 units, a 39.3% increase year-over-year.

Mexico is now the leading exporter of electric vehicles to the US, surpassing Japan and South Korea

Chinese investment continued as Shanghai-based Yongmaotai announced a $63 million auto parts plant in Coahuila. Mexico’s first green hydrogen plant opened in Querétaro, a partnership between German company Gerresheimer and Mexican company Cryoinfra requiring 100 million pesos ($5.3 million) in investment. The plant will produce 500 cubic meters of green hydrogen daily, reducing CO₂ emissions by 100 tons annually.

Mexico’s Energy Ministry forecasts that 96% of private-sector energy investment will go toward renewables between 2025 and 2030.

Tourism faced challenges as Tulum’s hotel occupancy dropped sharply, falling 17.5 percentage points in September to 49.2%, a drop attributed to high prices and increasing amounts of sargassum seaweed washing ashore on local beaches.

Cartel violence costs lives and stifles growth

Violence and organized crime remained pressing concerns. Authorities confirmed the discovery of 60 bodies at a clandestine burial site near Hermosillo, Sonora, with the Sonora Peace Seekers collective uncovering the remains between January and February. Five suspects have been arrested.

A drone attack targeted a Mexican government office in Tijuana on Wednesday night, with cartels deploying three drones carrying improvised explosive devices filled with nails and metal pieces. The attack damaged cars at the state attorney general’s anti-kidnapping unit but caused no casualties. The U.S. Consulate issued a security alert following the incident.

In Mexico City, prominent lawyer David Cohen Sacal was shot dead outside a courthouse on October 14, attacked at point-blank range by an 18-year-old assailant.

Sinaloa foreign direct investment plummets amid cartel turf war

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security raised alarms about Mexican cartels supposedly offering bounties of up to $50,000 for attacks on U.S. federal agents. At Wednesday’s press conference, Sheinbaum said the U.S. hadn’t provided Mexico with any evidence related to the alleged bounty program.

Violence in Sinaloa took its economic toll as foreign direct investment plummeted 87% during the first six months of 2025, shrinking from $262.8 million to $34.3 million.

Mexico-US diplomatic tensions

Relations between the two nations showed strain when Reuters reported that more than 50 Morena-affiliated politicians have had their U.S. visas revoked, with the total potentially exceeding 70. Former U.S. ambassadors suggested the Trump administration is using this tool more aggressively on drug trafficking and corruption issues.

New laws and institutional changes

Congress approved a major reform to the Amparo Law, with supporters claiming it will release over 2 billion pesos ($108 million) in tax credits. At Thursday’s press conference, Sheinbaum dismissed Fitch Ratings’ concerns that the reform could dampen investment.

The Chamber of Deputies raised fees on tourist and residency visas, with some residency permits more than doubling in cost. A one-year temporary residency visa will rise from 5,328 pesos ($290) to 11,140 pesos ($606), while permanent residency will climb from 6,494 pesos ($353) to 13,578 pesos ($738). The legislation also doubles admission fees to priority museums and archaeological sites and raises taxes on soft drinks, electrolyte beverages, tobacco and casino gambling.

In a cybersecurity revelation, U.S. researchers found that much Mexican satellite data is unencrypted. Computer scientists intercepted unencrypted communications from Mexican government agencies, the military, and companies using $600 worth of equipment. At Friday’s press conference, Defense Minister Ricardo Trevilla insisted all military communications are encrypted and denied evidence of data interception.

The Bank of Mexico also began withdrawing the blue 20-peso bill featuring President Benito Juárez after nearly 20 years in circulation.

Nuevo León Governor Samuel García inaugurated the first phase of the $1.2 billion Interserrana Highway, which will reduce travel times from southern Nuevo León to Monterrey from five hours to three.

Cultural highlights

Even as the country struggled with natural disasters and security problems, Mexico’s cultural scene flourished both at home and abroad. Stars gathered at the 23rd Morelia International Film Festival, featuring Brazilian filmmaker Kleber Mendonça Filho, French actress Juliette Binoche, and Oscar-winning writer Charlie Kaufman.

Former Mexico City street sweeper Macario Martínez performed on NPR’s “Tiny Desk Concert,” eight months after his viral sensation “Sueña Lindo, Corazón” captivated social media.

Mexican cyclist Isaac del Toro claimed victory at the Giro del Veneto, his 16th title of 2025. The 21-year-old now ranks third in UCI world rankings.

Finally, archaeologists announced the discovery of a rare 1,400-year-old scorpion-shaped mound in Puebla’s Tehuacán Valley, described as “unprecedented” in Mesoamerica and possibly used as an astronomical observatory.

Wild Mexico

Mexico’s unparalleled natural biodiversity was on display as three iconic species made headlines this week. Gulf of California whales are suing for their right to a livable habitat, a potentially groundbreaking lawsuit allowing non-human plaintiffs (the charges were filed on behalf of the whales by the NGO Nuestro Futuro). Monarch butterflies began their annual migration to Mexico, expected to reach Michoacán and México state by early November.

And in Oaxaca, a jaguar cub named Yazu was born at the Yagul Jaguar Sanctuary, the first birth produced via the Jaguar Genetic Bank project, offering hope for the threatened species.

Looking ahead

Mexico faces a critical juncture as it navigates intersecting crises: The flooding disasters exposed infrastructure vulnerabilities requiring sustained investment. Sheinbaum’s government must balance disaster response with security challenges and increasingly complex U.S. relations. Meanwhile, critics say recent legal reforms could undermine average citizens’ access to justice. Yet amid these difficulties, Mexico’s surging EV exports, renewable energy leadership, cultural achievements and environmental conservation efforts demonstrate resilience and adaptability that may prove crucial for navigating the uncertain times ahead.

It has published a national plan to train the next generation of clean energy workers, with employment expected to double to 860,000 by 2030.

It says Wales will benefit from up to 20,000 clean energy jobs by 2030. Key skills needed in the region include trades such as electricians, bricklayers and plumbers as well as engineers and metal workers, with the largest clean energy employer expected to be in carbon capture as well as offshore wind, the UK Government said.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has also set out the role the UK Government wants to see trade unions play in clean energy. Across the broader energy sector, trade union coverage has declined from more than 70% in the mid 1990s to around 30% today.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said:

“Wales is essential to the clean energy revolution that this government is delivering. Communities across Wales have long been calling out for a new generation of good industrial jobs. The clean energy jobs boom can answer that call – and today we publish a landmark national plan to make it happen.

“Our plans will help create an economy in which there is no need to leave your hometown just to find a decent job. Thanks to this government’s commitment to clean energy a generation of young people in our industrial heartlands can have well-paid secure jobs, from plumbers to electricians and welders.

“This is a pro-worker, pro-jobs, pro-union, agenda that will deliver the national renewal our country needs.”

In January it was announced that Pembrokeshire had been identified as a ‘key growth region for clean energy’ and was set to receive around £1 million in skills funding.

The skills regional funding comes from the UK Government’s Office for Clean Energy Skills Fund and will be awarded for skills mapping to the Welsh Government. It will be responsible for developing a plan for how best to target the money.

The UK Government said funding could go towards new training centres, courses or career advisers, supporting people into opportunities in industries such as welding, electrical engineering, and construction.

Welsh Government Minister for Skills, Jack Sargeant, said:

“Our ambition is to ensure today’s young people will have the skills needed to work the jobs of tomorrow, helping us embed the industries and services of the future in our communities.

“With decades of industrial expertise Wales is primed to capitalise on the generational opportunity that is the UK’s clean energy revolution. The plan announced today will complement our Net Zero Skills Action Plan and support our journey to a cleaner, more prosperous Wales.”

The UK Government said new skills initiatives include:

Training up the next generation of clean energy workers – Five new Technical Excellence Colleges will help train young people into essential roles. Skills pilots in Pembrokeshire, Cheshire and Lincolnshire will be backed by a total of £2.5 million – which could go towards new training centres, courses or career advisers.

Harnessing the valuable expertise and transferrable skills of veterans – Working with Mission Renewable, the UK Government is launching a new programme to match veterans up with careers in solar panel installation, wind turbine factories, and nuclear power stations.

Tailored schemes for ex-offenders, school leavers, and the unemployed – Last year, 13,700 people who were out of work possessed many of the skills required for key roles in the clean energy sector, such as engineering and skilled trades.

Upskill existing workers – Oil and gas workers will benefit from up to £20 million in total from the UK and Scottish Governments to provide bespoke careers training for thousands of new roles in clean energy. This follows high demand for the Aberdeen skills pilot, which is already supporting workers into new careers. Government is also extending the ‘energy skills passport’, which identifies routes for oil and gas workers to easily transition into roles in offshore wind, to new sectors including nuclear and the electricity grid.

Russell Greenslade, Director of CBI Wales, said:

“The growth of Wales’ clean energy economy is opening up real opportunities for people and communities right across the nation. The launch of the Clean Energy Jobs Plan provides a practical, forward-looking framework to connect local talent with both the opportunities emerging in this fast-developing sector and with the businesses driving delivery on the ground.

“Wales is already showing how workers, particularly those from traditional industries, can successfully transition into clean energy roles, drawing on our established strengths and deep industrial heritage. If we want people to feel genuinely invested in this transition and empowered to play their part, we must clearly show them where they fit in and how their skills and experience can contribute to Wales’ cleaner, stronger economic future.”

Zac Richardson, Group Chief Engineer at National Grid, said:

“Secure, affordable and clean energy is essential to unlocking UK economic growth and productivity – ambitions which are underpinned by electricity networks and the unprecedented levels of planned investment in them.

“We welcome the UK Government’s focus on skills and training – especially for technical roles vital to our energy future – and look forward to working together to build a diverse, homegrown workforce that can deliver the grid of tomorrow.”

The plan also includes proposals such as:

Closing loopholes in legislation to extend employment protections enjoyed by offshore oil and gas workers working beyond UK territorial seas, including the national minimum wage, to the clean energy sector.

A new Fair Work Charter between offshore wind developers and trade unions to ensure that companies benefiting from public funding provide decent wages and strong workplace rights.

Workforce criteria in grants and procurements to test and pilot innovative ways to drive fair work and skills in DESNZ grants and contracts, including through the Clean Industry Bonus and the newly formed Great British Energy.

With at least one in six ex-military already armed with many of the skills needed for the clean energy sector, the UK Government is joining forces with Mission Renewable to match them up with careers in solar panel installation, wind turbine factories, and nuclear power stations. The pilot will initially focus on the East of England, which will benefit from the biggest increase in the size of the clean energy workforce with over 55,000 people expected to be employed in the sector by the end of the decade.",https://businessnewswales.com/wp-content/uploads/Solar-Panels-Local-Energy.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 20:04:15.044436

Up to £18m of new money has been pledged by the UK and Scottish governments specifically to move those working in the oil and gas sector into new roles.

Their jobs are about to fall off a cliff as the industry declines, with at least 40,000 of the current 115,000 jobs forecast to disappear by the early 2030s.

Almost all of those roles are thought to be fairly easily transferable into green industries - requiring little more than a few months of extra training.

But in the absence of government help, workers have been moving abroad, industry says, taking with them the expertise Britain badly needs to for its new greener energy system.

And it has left them feeling forgotten about after years of working to keep the lights on, and increasingly swayed by Reform UK, both GMB and Unite unions have warned Labour.

Pledge to double green jobs by 2030

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband told Sky News that creating jobs in sectors like carbon capture and storage and hydrogen would help ""create a future for those in the North Sea communities"".

The new £18m will pay for careers advice, training, and ""skills passports"" to enable oil and gas workers to make the switch without having to repeat qualifications.

The cash was announced on Sunday in the new Clean Energy Jobs Plan, which details how the government hopes to make good on its promise to double green jobs by 2030.

Mr Miliband said in an interview: ""This plan shows 400,000 extra jobs in the clean energy economy by 2030.

""This isn't a target. This is actually what we believe is necessary to meet all the plans we have across the economy.""

The first strategy of its kind hopes to plug the UK's massive skills gap that threatens to derail the government's target to green the electricity system by 2030.

It identifies 31 priority occupations that are particularly in demand, such as plumbers, electricians and welders, and lists a target to convert five colleges into new ""Technical Excellence Colleges"" to train workers.

'You can't train people for jobs that aren't there'

Unions welcomed the plan, but pointed out that skills and training do not equate to new jobs.

They say it will mean nothing without extra money and a revitalised domestic supply chain to build all the green technology needed, from fibreglass wind turbines to aluminium sub-sea cables.

Sharon Graham, the Unite general secretary who has threatened to cut ties with Labour over its policy to end North Sea oil and gas drilling and watering down of a ban on zero-hours contracts, welcomed the ""initial steps"" but called for ""an equally ambitious programme of public investment"".

Professor Paul de Leeuw from the Energy Transition Institute in Aberdeen said the plan was ""genuinely new and different"", and had for the first time joined up relevant information and strategies in one place.

But ""you can't train people for jobs that aren't there"", he added, also calling for an investment plan.f

Reform heartlands could benefit from Labour's jobs plan

The boom in clean energy jobs stands to benefit Reform heartlands along the east coast of Britain.

That fact is more by luck than design, given the east coast's proximity to offshore wind farms and carbon capture and storage fields in the North Sea.

Reform promises a radically different vision for the country's future, based on reopening coal mines and maxing out nuclear power and what's left of North Sea oil and gas to boost jobs and the economy.

Its deputy leader, Richard Tice, objects to land being used for solar panels and pylons.

Government modelling forecasts an additional 35,000 direct jobs in Scotland, 55,000 in the East of England and 50,000 in the North West.

To keep the unions sweet, the government will also have to follow through on its pledge to boost the rights of those working offshore in green energy.

A generation of young people across Wales will benefit from the good jobs and high wages that the booming clean energy economy can bring, the government added.

As part of the plans, Pembrokeshire will become home to one of five new Technical Excellence Colleges across the UK, which will help train young people into essential roles.

Skills pilots will be backed by a total of £2.5 million – which could go towards new training centres, courses or career advisers.

The government said its national plan will ensure jobs are ""high quality and well paid"".

""Setting clear workforce estimates for the first time will galvanise industry, the public sector, and education providers to work together to deliver one cohesive strategy to invest in training for specific in demand occupations.""

As well as taking a swipe at Nigel Farage's Reform party the government also signalled support for trade unions for workers' pay and conditions.

It said: ""In clear contrast, Nigel Farage’s “war on clean energy jobs” would threaten all of these jobs.

""Farage’s Party’s ideological opposition to clean energy would rob communities of good jobs in the industries of the future and lose billions of pounds of investment from areas like Wales.

""The Energy Secretary will also set out how this government sees trade unions as an essential part of the modern workplace and economy. Across the broader energy sector, trade union coverage has declined from over 70% in the mid 90s to around 30% today. Recognising trade unions is vital to securing high pay and good conditions for workers.""

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: “Communities have long been calling out for a new generation of good industrial jobs. The clean energy jobs boom can answer that call - and today we publish a landmark national plan to make it happen.

“Our plans will help create an economy in which there is no need to leave your hometown just to find a decent job. Thanks to this government’s commitment to clean energy, a generation of young people in our industrial heartlands can have well-paid secure jobs, from plumbers to electricians and welders.

“This is a pro-worker, pro-jobs, pro-union agenda that will deliver the national renewal our country needs.”

Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Pat McFadden echoed this saying: “We're giving workers the skills needed for switch to clean energy, which is good for them, good for industry - and will drive growth across the nation.""

First Minister Eluned Morgan said the plan was an opportunity for skilled, secure jobs. She also used the announcement to take a swipe at rivals as the Senedd election looms. Welsh Secretary Jo Stevens said the jobs would be a ""gamechanger"" for Wales and its green ambitions.

“Wales has a proud industrial heritage. Our coal powered the world and our communities still bear that legacy. Now we look to the future and to the industries of the future, ""Eluned Morgan said.

“Nigel Farage wants to take Wales backwards. He and his team want to tear up net zero plans. And Plaid Cymru say they want to see net-zero but try to block infrastructure that could deliver that.

“With Labour in power, Wales will be at the forefront of the green revolution, seizing the opportunity of skilled, secure jobs leading to more pounds in people’s pockets.”

The UK Government said its ""clean energy mission"" has attracted more than £50 billion of private investment since last July.

On Thursday, a group of more than a dozen state attorneys general decided to sue the Trump administration over the termination of $7 billion in funding that was allocated to the Solar for All program.

The letter from the group of senators argues that the program would have reduced electricity bills by 20% for 900,000 households nationwide.

It says the termination is “unlawful” and the funding was “appropriated and fully obligated.”

Arizona delegation sent previous letter to EPA administrator Zeldin

A separate letter was signed by an Arizona delegation including Gallego, Kelly, Rep. Greg Stanton, Rep. Asmin Ansari and Governor Katie Hobbs on Aug. 14.

“Arizona is a prime spot for energy investments that will create good-paying jobs and lower the cost of utility bills,” said Sen. Kelly said in a release from the previous letter. “With so many of these project coming to the state, cutting funding to solar grants will hurt Arizona families.”

Stats regarding Solar for All program

The Solar for All program was introduced in 2022 as part of former President Joe Biden’s landmark climate law, intended to make the renewable energy accessible to nearly 1 million Americans.

The $7 billion program was terminated on Aug. 7, Zeldin announced.

However, the termination of some of the grant funding began in March 2025.

A release from the EPA in 2024 said the program had already chosen 60 selectees to receive grant awards and provide solar to low-income households.

“Arizona families are already struggling with rising energy costs, and the Trump administration just made things worse by canceling $156 million in funding meant to help lower energy bills and create good-paying jobs across Arizona,” said Sen. Gallego.

Automakers and governments are grappling with economic realities, including sluggish consumer demand, high production costs, and supply-chain disruptions, leading to revised targets and delayed mandates.

In the U.S., the retreat has been stark. General Motors recently announced a $1.6 billion charge related to declining EV sales, attributing the downturn to policy shifts and market conditions. This comes amid broader industry adjustments, where even pioneers like Tesla have scaled back expansion plans amid softening demand.

Policy Shifts in North America and Europe Signal a Broader Reassessment of EV Goals

Canada, under Prime Minister Mark Carney, has paused its electric-vehicle sales mandate originally slated for next year, citing the need for a more pragmatic timeline to avoid economic strain on consumers and manufacturers. Similarly, in the United Kingdom, Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s administration has introduced flexibility into the nation’s EV targets, allowing for phased implementation rather than rigid deadlines.

The European Union, long a leader in aggressive climate policies, bowed to pressure from automakers last month by initiating an early review of its 2035 goal to eliminate carbon-dioxide emissions from new cars. This move, as reported in The Wall Street Journal, reflects growing concerns over job losses in the automotive sector and the feasibility of rapid electrification without sufficient infrastructure.

Economic Pressures and Market Realities Are Forcing Even Ambitious Nations to Recalibrate

Even China, the world’s largest EV market, is showing signs of strain. While still dominating global production, Beijing has begun to temper subsidies and incentives, leading to a slowdown in sales growth. According to insights from LiveMint, economic concerns such as overcapacity and international trade tensions are prompting this caution, with exports facing tariffs in key markets like the U.S. and EU.

This synchronized retreat underscores a pivotal moment for the auto industry. High battery costs, inadequate charging networks, and consumer hesitancy—fueled by range anxiety and higher upfront prices—have exposed the limitations of top-down mandates. In the U.S., the Biden administration’s ambitious EV tax credits have not fully offset these barriers, resulting in inventory pileups at dealerships.

Industry Insiders Weigh the Long-Term Implications for Innovation and Supply Chains

For industry executives, this global realignment offers both challenges and opportunities. Companies like Ford and Volkswagen are pivoting toward hybrid models as a bridge technology, investing in flexible manufacturing lines that can adapt to shifting demand. Analysts note that while pure EV adoption slows, advancements in battery technology and renewable energy integration could accelerate once economic conditions improve.

Yet, the retreat raises questions about meeting Paris Agreement climate goals. As Political Wire highlights, without sustained policy support, the transition risks stalling, potentially ceding technological leadership to regions that maintain momentum. In the EU, for instance, automakers are lobbying for extended deadlines to preserve competitiveness against Chinese rivals.

Andy Beshear has joined elected Democrats from other states in suing the Trump administration to stop what they call the “unlawful termination” of billions of dollars for residential solar projects.

A press release Wednesday from California Attorney General Rob Bonta stated the cancellation of the $7 billion “Solar for All” program denied states “critical funds they were depending on for solar energy in low-income and disadvantaged communities nationwide.”

Bonta is among more than a dozen Democratic attorneys general, along with Beshear and Democratic Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who are plaintiffs in the lawsuits alleging the program’s termination is illegal and unconstitutional.

When the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency terminated the program in August, Administrator Lee Zeldin in a statement on social media said the agency’s authority to administer the program was eliminated through the passage of a tax-and-spending law signed by Trump this summer. The Associated Press reported Zeldin characterized the program as a “boondoggle.”

Congress created the “Solar for All” program through the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, and the program aimed to expand residential solar energy projects to hundreds of thousands of low-income households across the country.

Kentucky officials planned to use a portion of $62 million from the program to install residential solar panels paired with battery storage systems on homes in “disaster-impacted communities.” A group of stakeholders had met several times this year in planning how the state would use the funding in communities affected by floods and tornadoes.

Robin Hartman, a spokesperson for the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet, in an early September email to the Lantern said the state couldn’t access its “Solar for All” funding because it was being “unlawfully withheld by the federal administration.”

It would be built on 50 acres within a 425-acre parcel directly adjacent to Tenaska’s 1-gigawatt gas plant in Fluvanna that began operations in 2004.
But a Fluvanna County ordinance passed last year sets requirements on solar development that have effectively banned it.
“Tenaska submitted a variety of projects and technologies into that [PJM] process, including battery projects, which were accepted,” said Ross, Tenaska’s spokesperson.
Fairchild said the existing gas plant can be heard from his nearby Cunningham Creek Winery.","SCOTTSVILLE, Va.—In rural Fluvanna County about an hour west of the state capital, a proposed natural gas power plant offers a window into a multi-state effort to speed more electricity sources onto the grid.

All but a handful of the projects in the initiative by PJM Interconnection, which runs the regional grid, would belch carbon pollution. Tenaska Energy’s proposal is among those dubbed by PJM as “shovel-ready, high-reliability” generation projects that would get a faster path through the clogged queue to connect to a grid increasingly stressed by power-hungry data centers.

But power plants need local approval, too. Tenaska’s proposal, which has some support, also faces concerns from residents about health effects, noise and transparency.

Last week the Fluvanna County Planning Commission deferred until November any decision on whether the 1.5-gigawatt plant is in “substantial accord” with the county’s comprehensive plan, a crucial step needed along with a special-use permit that will be voted on in January.

“I think we’d like to rely on science and independent judgment before we’re asked to take what is a very critical step for this community and its long-term future,” said commission member Kathleen Kilpatrick.

The company wants to build the project next to a gas plant it already operates in the county, the Tenaska Virginia Generating Station. Amber Kidd, a Fluvanna resident, told Inside Climate News that she supports the Nebraska-based developer’s proposal, given that her family has worked at the existing plant without any safety issues.

“We are a fossil-fuel family,” said Kidd. “I’m very proud of where we work and want to see this come. Rural areas that continue to refuse growth, they die off. … I support the jobs.”

In a county of about 30,000 people that President Donald Trump won by about six points, his staunch support for fossil fuels is far from universally shared by its residents. Lauren Banning, at the planning commission meeting last week, said she is concerned about toxic emissions more than a “negligible tax break, a few jobs, not even 50.”

“My kids love playing outside all day long, but if I’m scared of the air not being breathable, how is this helping our county and our community?” Banning said.

The Proposal

The proposed $2.2 billion plant, called the Expedition Generating Station, is expected to come online in 2031 after obtaining local, state and federal permits. It would be built on 50 acres within a 425-acre parcel directly adjacent to Tenaska’s 1-gigawatt gas plant in Fluvanna that began operations in 2004.

Timberly Ross, a spokesperson for the company, told Inside Climate News that the planning commission vote deferral “pushes us back a few months, but we remain committed to bringing this much-needed development to Fluvanna County.”

Tenaska said the new plant could power up to 1.5 million homes. It’s part of PJM’s Reliability Resource Initiative, called RRI for short. PJM, which oversees a competitive market for wholesale electricity in all or part of 13 states and the District of Columbia, is inserting RRI projects into its backlogged queue of interconnection requests.

Most of the non-RRI projects waiting to connect to the grid are renewables.

PJM created the initiative to ensure ample electric generating capacity and avoid shortages resulting from data centers’ surging demands. But clean energy supporters have decried that projects that are mostly fueled by natural gas will leapfrog renewables that have long waited their turn to start cranking out electricity.

Virginia’s largest utility, Dominion Energy, is planning for several gas plants alongside a number of renewable energy projects of its own to meet demand. Tenaska is an independent power producer that would sell electricity from Expedition either directly into the regional grid or to Dominion through a power purchase agreement.

Since the Virginia Clean Economy Act’s goal to decarbonize the electric grid by 2050 applies to only Dominion and utility Appalachian Power, Tenaska is not bound by requirements to prove the need for the plant or retire it within the next 25 years.

“This location is attractive due to access to existing transmission corridors, water supply and natural gas pipelines,” the company said in a presentation before the planning commission.

Tenaska also builds renewables projects. But a Fluvanna County ordinance passed last year sets requirements on solar development that have effectively banned it.

“Tenaska submitted a variety of projects and technologies into that [PJM] process, including battery projects, which were accepted,” said Ross, Tenaska’s spokesperson. But in Fluvanna, given local hostility to renewables, Ross said the gas plant “is the appropriate technology for this location.”

Questions About Air Pollution, Noise

Tenaska hasn’t yet disclosed expected pollution levels from the new plant. Nor has it shared in planning meetings what its current plant’s emissions have been.

Instead, at the planning commission meeting, Tenaska representatives noted what the company had anticipated its existing plant’s emissions of nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide and two types of fine particle pollution would be, estimated years before the project was built. They said it showed rates “less than 15 percent of the applicable standard.”

All of those pollutants can cause serious health problems, particularly involving the lungs.

Josephus Allmond, a resident of Fluvanna and an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, shared information on cancer rates at a meeting in October held by Chris Fairchild, the Board of Supervisors’ chairman. Allmond cited a 2012 report by the regional health district showing that lung cancer incidents in Fluvanna County between 2004 to 2008, the period just after Tenaska built its first plant, increased more than 30 percent compared with 1999 to 2003.

“My question for the folks at Tenaska: That was for a plant slightly under 1,000 megawatts—can we expect an even bigger increase in incidents of lung cancer if this plant is approved?” said Allmond.

Residents asked the company at that meeting why it wasn’t sharing actual pollution figures from its operating plants around the country. Tenaska officials said they would share more emissions data later, through the state’s pollution permitting process.

The company on its website also states that “claims regarding the plant and local cancer cases are ridiculous and defamatory.” Federal air standards protect against health impacts, including cancer, the company contends, and it says the new plant will be categorized as a “minor source of hazardous air pollutants” under the Clean Air Act.

Another worry raised by residents at that meeting was noise. Fairchild said the existing gas plant can be heard from his nearby Cunningham Creek Winery.

“I have the same concerns,” Fairchild told the residents. “But we don’t deal with a $2 billion item every day. There are a lot of concerns that haven’t been addressed.”

The company’s spokesperson told Inside Climate News that the current plant is a net positive for the area.

“Tenaska has operated in Fluvanna County for more than 20 years, consistently meeting stringent air quality standards, operating under the county-mandated sound levels and providing roughly $35 million in tax revenue to the county,” Ross said. “Our application … not only provided those facts but also included robust supplemental materials, including an independent sound study, economic impact study, traffic plan and visual renderings.”

Laurie Partner, a local real estate agent whose husband works at the plant, said to the planning commission that the smoke coming from the stacks was “steam,” and cancer can come from other sources like smoking and microwaving plastics.

“It was almost sickening to me to hear all the misinformation that was stated there,” Partner said in an interview with Inside Climate News.

Sharon Harris, a Fluvanna resident, said she sees a lot of misinformation floating around the county about a main alternative to new gas plants: solar. As a founding member of the Fluvanna Horizons Alliance, which opposes Tenaska’s project, she wants to raise awareness of who needs the power—data centers, not local residents—and a better understanding of how solar works.

Local resentment toward clean energy has grown through hours-long county meetings discussing potential harms to farmland from solar, stormwater runoff concerns and a presentation from the Citizen Defenders of Fluvanna County on what to do with solar panels after they’ve reached the end of their life. Some residents still see it as an expensive form of energy, even though financial advisory firm Lazard’s widely cited research on electricity costs shows solar is now the cheapest option.

“There’s definitely a lack of knowledge and information in our community,” said Harris.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/20251007_205441.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 17:07:27.815593

Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) spokesperson Trudi Webster told Texas Scorecard that the Public Utility Commission of Texas has started rule-making “with the purpose of implementing the SB6 performance requirements for data centers’ and other large loads’ response during emergencies.”

Signed into law in 2023, Senate Bill 6, Webster explained, “creates performance requirements for new large loads during emergency conditions.”

Large loads are high electricity demand consumers, such as the newly operational Stargate data center campus in Abilene and bitcoin mining operations like the one in Rockdale, Texas.

While Texas’ regulators are imposing stricter performance standards, concerns remain over how the state can sustain these energy-hungry projects.

Stargate I campus in Abilene will have a 1.2 gigawatt (GW) power capacity, which equates to roughly 1,200 megawatts (MW), when fully completed in 2026. If the facility ran at maximum capacity when fully completed, the campus would consume 10,512,000 MWh (megawatt hours) per year. That’s enough energy to power over 1 million homes in 2025.

Data centers in Texas are forecasted by ERCOT to have a total demand of 77,965 MW in 2030. This is an increased projection from 2024, which projected a load of only 29,614 MW.

The World Economic Forum reported it is “impossible to accommodate the growth in AI data centres and maintain grid stability without prices increasing for all customers” in deregulated electricity markets like Texas.

Enverus, a publisher of energy-sector research, released a report revealing that ERCOT has “added 22.5 GW of new capacity since January 2024 … and is planning for nearly 100 GW of solar and battery additions by 2030.”

This is roughly 22,500 MW of capacity added since the beginning of last year, with planned additions of roughly 100,000 MW by 2030.

The Texas Energy Fund—overseen by the Public Utility Commission of Texas—provides grants and loans to finance the construction, maintenance, modernization, and operation of electric facilities in Texas.

According to the Enverus report, the Texas Energy Fund’s active due diligence process has seen four project withdrawals in March, two denials in April, four new projects advanced in April and May, and its first two loans awarded this summer.

While the electricity infrastructure projects appear to be slowing down and energy demands continue to increase, another issue exists in addition to rising utility bills.

Electricity consumption and water usage go hand-in-hand.

As previously reported, the Texas Water Development Board has explained that one of the reasons why Texas does not know how much water is actually being consumed by data centers in the state is because of “the variety of power sources that require varying amounts of water.” Additionally, there is “no state government authority that maintains a comprehensive list of data centers in the state.”

The indirect water consumption by data centers in 2023 has been estimated by researchers to be 4.52 liters per kilowatt hour (kWh) compared with the average American water intensity factor for electricity usage of 4.35 liters per kWh.

Amid uncertain water consumption further exacerbating infrastructure, drought, and aquifer concerns and high electricity demands, data center construction continues to proliferate throughout Texas.",https://dallasexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Pylon-high-voltage-tower-sky-background-Image-by-wing-wingShutterstock.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 17:11:38.627539

The Italian-American automaker, which owns Jeep, Dodge, Ram and Chrysler brands, will create more than 5,000 jobs while increasing domestic production capacity by 50 percent across facilities in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan and Indiana.

CEO Antonio Filosa framed the massive commitment as foundational to the company’s turnaround strategy under his leadership. Since taking the helm in June, Filosa has prioritized strengthening Stellantis’ position in the United States, its most critical market. The investment represents a signal of confidence in American manufacturing despite significant tariff pressures facing the industry.

The plan encompasses five entirely new vehicles and 19 product refreshes planned through 2029. Rather than focusing heavily on electric vehicles, Stellantis is balancing its product portfolio to include combustion engines, plug-in hybrids, and range-extended electric models alongside traditional powertrains. This marks a strategic shift from previous aggressive electrification timelines.

Illinois will see the reopening of Stellantis’ Belvidere Assembly Plant with more than $600 million in investment. The facility, shuttered in recent years, will produce Jeep Cherokee and Compass models starting in 2027, creating approximately 3,300 jobs. Ohio’s Toledo Assembly Complex will receive nearly $400 million to build a new midsize truck beginning in 2028, adding over 900 positions.

Michigan will host two significant initiatives. The Warren Truck Assembly Plant will invest nearly $100 million to produce a new range-extended electric vehicle combined with a gasoline-powered large SUV starting in 2028, adding more than 900 jobs. Additionally, the Detroit Assembly Complex will receive $130 million to begin producing the next-generation Dodge Durango in 2029.

Indiana will continue engine manufacturing with more than $100 million invested in Kokomo facilities to produce the all-new four-cylinder GMET4 EVO engine beginning in 2026, supporting over 100 new positions. The engine represents Stellantis’ commitment to maintaining manufacturing of strategic powertrains domestically.

The automaker emphasized that these investments include research and development costs, supplier expenditures necessary to execute its full product strategy, and manufacturing facility improvements. State and local government approvals remain required before funds are deployed, though the company expressed confidence in negotiations.

Analysts noted the investment arrives amid significant tariff pressures on imported vehicles and components. Stellantis has projected tariffs will cost the company approximately $1.7 billion this year. By consolidating American production, the company potentially reduces exposure to these costs while gaining access to government incentives and consumer preferences for domestically manufactured vehicles.

The announcement represents part of broader industry reshoring efforts. General Motors and Ford have announced comparable investments, with GM recently moving production from Mexico to three American plants and Ford investing $2 billion in Kentucky for electric vehicle production.

Stellantis supports approximately 48,000 American employees across 34 manufacturing facilities, distribution centers and research sites spanning 14 states. The company operates 2,600 dealerships and works with roughly 2,300 suppliers throughout thousands of American communities.

“Even the seasons form a great circle in their changing, and always come back to where they were. The life of a man is a circle from childhood to childhood, and so it is in everything where power moves.”

— attributed to Black Elk (1863-1950)

The environmental movement lost a champion with the Sept. 16 passing of local activist and preservationist Paul Gallimore. With his life partner, Pat, Paul co-founded the Long Branch Environmental Education Center, protecting 1,435 acres in the Newfound Mountains starting in the 1970s and showcasing permaculture practices.

An Appalachian Sustainable Agriculture Project farm, Paul grew organic berries and apples and helped to introduce blight-resistant chestnut trees. He built passive solar structures, microhydro power systems and a trout pond, and created compost to add nutrients to the soil. The center is open to the public and mentors participants in ecological practices, while nourishing their souls in the beauty of nature.

Harmony with nature

Paul had great reverence for the Native Americans who initially occupied this land and quoted Black Elk in his 2007 work, Healing Appalachia: Sustainable Living Through Appropriate Technology, co-authored with Al Fritsch, founder of the Appalachia-Science in the Public Interest, a small nonprofit in Kentucky. That publication details sustainable efforts that can be implemented to live in harmony with nature, including solar, photovoltaics, wind power, food production and preservation, silviculture, water irrigation and conservation, among others.

Paul was a champion for respecting the myriad of life forms that occupy our mountains and worked tirelessly to oppose a state law that permitted the slaughtering of 50-pound black bear cubs. (The N.C. Wildlife Resources Commission redefined a bear cub as one weighing 75 pounds or less, thereby protecting smaller cubs from hunting, in 2016.) He revered the songs of birds, the diversity of reptiles and the presence of mammals on his land.

Acting locally

My personal experience with Paul began before I had the opportunity to make Western North Carolina my home. I visited his Buncombe County mountain paradise and was awed by its involvements and Paul’s encyclopedic knowledge of the natural world. I subsequently worked with Paul in the mid-1980s to found Save the Mountains, a citizens group opposing the U.S. Department of Energy’s proposal to site a three-county, high-level nuclear waste dump with an epicenter in Big Sandy Mush. Later serving on the district staff of U.S. Rep. Jamie Clarke, I realized how serious this proposal had been and how instrumental our efforts and those of thousands of local concerned citizens had been in stopping this siting.

My later efforts included working with Paul to encourage the co-composting of the organic fraction of Buncombe County’s landfill with clean sewage sludge from the nearby Metropolitan Sewage District (MSD), resulting in a rich soil amendment. This concept was rejected, and MSD instead built a sludge incinerator at its Woodfin facility.

When decisions were being made regarding the siting of a new landfill, Paul worked closely with residents and the county’s solid waste committee to advocate incorporating the state’s solid waste management priorities to first reduce waste, then reuse, recycle, compost and (last) landfill it. He introduced national and international experts to discuss the advantages of large-scale municipal waste recycling and composting programs as prototypes that could be implemented. These initiatives were not followed, and the county acted only to site another landfill.

As the 40-plus-year warnings of the effects of global climate change become lead disaster stories on the evening news, and our own area has been devastated by the fury of Tropical Storm Helene, I lament that the insight and common sense of individuals like Paul Gallimore have not been heeded. The greatest tribute we can provide his legacy is to pursue “good trouble” in our civic engagements and practice sustainability in our own lives.",https://mountainx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/favicon-1.png,N,,2025-10-18 17:11:44.545073

DHL Express announced the rollout of 45 new all-electric, zero-emission Mercedes-Benz eSprinter vans into its U.S. pickup and delivery fleet, signifying the first U.S. expansion of the global partnership, with more than 10,000 eSprinters now integrated into DHL’s fleet.

All vehicles are expected to be delivered by the end of October 2025, and will be deployed across key metropolitan markets, including Chicago, Illinois; Indianapolis, Indiana; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Elizabeth, New Jersey; and Moonachie, New Jersey.

While the new eSprinters promise a 206-mile range, DHL has consistently seen them exceed 240 miles, making them the longest-range battery electric vehicles in DHL’s U.S. fleet to-date. This extended capacity makes them ideally suited for inner city logistics while expanding their potential use in longer delivery routes. The vans also offer significant cargo capacity, enabling efficient last-mile delivery without compromise on payload or operational reliability.

To support the integration of these vehicles, DHL has also installed on-site charging infrastructure at its facilities in these markets, enabling drivers to conveniently recharge the vans between routes. The addition of this infrastructure ensures operational efficiency, maximizes vehicle uptime, and provides the foundation for future fleet electrification as the company scales its use of electric vehicles in the U.S.

“Electrifying our fleet is one of the most visible and impactful ways we are moving toward a more sustainable future,” said Greg Hewitt, CEO of DHL Express U.S. “The Mercedes-Benz eSprinter brings an extended range and proven cargo capabilities that allow us to serve our customers with zero emissions, while also advancing our global goal of more sustainable logistics. These vehicles not only strengthen our operations in major U.S. cities but also set the stage for future electric fleet growth across the Americas.”

“The eSprinter represents the next generation of electric mobility for commercial fleets – combining range, cargo capacity, and reliability in a way that meets the demands of modern logistics,” said Jee-Seop Kim, Managing Director of Mercedes-Benz Vans North America’. “We’re proud to see our partnership with DHL Express expand into the U.S., where the eSprinter’s performance and versatility will support their high-efficiency operations.”

The deployment supports DHL’s global Sustainability Roadmap, which includes a target to electrify 66% of its last-mile delivery vehicles by 2030. This effort includes fleet electrification, the expansion of carbon-neutral facilities, and the increased use of sustainable aviation fuels, among other initiatives.

Today, it serves as a living laboratory for climate science, a place where melting glaciers, thawing permafrost, and changing ecosystems offer a glimpse into the Earth’s future.

Across its vast landscape — spanning 663,300 square miles — Alaska compresses global environmental challenges into one dramatic microcosm. Its mountains, tundra, and coastlines reveal how warming transforms not just local communities, but the entire planet. Scientists from around the world travel there to study these transformations, and their findings are reshaping what we know about climate change.

Here are some of the lessons the world is learning from Alaska, the frontline of a changing planet.

Glaciers are the Planet’s Thermometers

Alaska’s glaciers are among the fastest-melting in the world, losing about 66.7 billion tonnes of ice each year as of 2021. If all of Alaska’s glacier ice were to melt, the resulting meltwater would contribute approximately 46.4 mm to global sea-level rise. Glaciers around the world are vanishing faster than scientists can study them with 40% – 90% projected to disappear by the end of the century if current warming trends continue.

Glaciers act as natural climate records with each layer of compacted snow containing trapped air bubbles that can reveal what Earth’s atmosphere was like in the past. Ice cores, cylindrical samples of ice drilled from ice sheets or glaciers, act much like tree rings because they provide records of past environmental conditions. When scientists drill ice cores, they can track carbon dioxide levels, volcanic activity, and temperature shifts over thousands of years.

In August 2025, the rapid melting of Alaska’s Mendenhall Glacier led to the formation of a meltwater lake known locally as Suicide Basin, near Juneau. This ice-dammed basin periodically overflows as meltwater builds up and forces its way beneath the thinning glacier, which is losing roughly 100-150 feet of ice each year. When the pressure becomes too great, the basin drains suddenly, triggering destructive floods downstream. Because the sides of the lake are fragile, this sudden release can sweep up large amounts of sediment, posing a threat to buildings and infrastructure.

Sea ice and glaciers help keep the Earth cool by reflecting sunlight back into space, reducing the amount of heat absorbed by the planet. Without this reflective surface, the exposed water absorbs more heat, warming further and causing more ice to melt — a self-reinforcing cycle. The retreat of glaciers and the flooding of Alaska’s Mendenhall River serve as stark warnings of the global consequences of climate change. As these massive ice formations shrink, they accelerate sea-level rise, threaten the livelihoods and safety of coastal communities, and disrupt ocean circulation patterns that regulate the planet’s climate.

Thawing Permafrost = Unlocks Carbon

An estimated 85% of Alaska’s land is covered by permafrost — frozen ground that stores about twice as much carbon as is currently present in Earth’s entire atmosphere

When permafrost thaws, it releases carbon dioxide and methane, two potent greenhouse gases that intensify global warming. Researchers from the University of Alaska Fairbanks stated that the current thaw rates are accelerating. In just a few decades, previously solid ground has subsided into “thermokarst” landscapes that are uneven, soggy terrain where forests tilt and collapse.

This thawing sets up a self-reinforcing feedback loop: warming causes permafrost to melt, which releases massive stores of greenhouse gases (CO₂ and methane). Those emissions further warm the climate, accelerating permafrost degradation in a cycle known as the permafrost carbon–climate feedback. Given the vast carbon reservoirs locked in Arctic soils, many scientists warn this is one of Earth’s potential tipping points and Alaska’s rapidly changing landscapes provide a clear warning of how close we may be to crossing it.

Adapt or Die

Melting permafrost and the significant loss of reflective snow and ice, which leads to less sunlight being reflected and more heat being absorbed, a phenomenon also known as Arctic Amplification, is driving massive change in the region on many levels.

Alaska’s ecosystems and its people are adapting faster than almost anywhere else in the world. As the Arctic warms 3.5 times the global average, climate change is disrupting animal populations, and entire food webs are reorganizing.

For instance, salmon are now moving into rivers that were previously too cold to support them, altering local ecosystems. Yet even as their range expands, overall salmon populations are declining, which is disrupting Indigenous fishing patterns that have been practiced for centuries. The same warming that shifts salmon habits is also thawing permafrost, destabilizing infrastructure — from homes to pipelines — and forcing towns like Newtok to relocate.

Another example is the changing migration patterns of bowhead whales. As sea ice recedes, these whales are delaying their migrations. Once reliant on the Bering Sea’s winter feeding grounds, many now remain in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas year-round, adapting their diets as the shifting ice affects the availability of krill and zooplankton. What’s happening in Alaska offers a glimpse of the environmental, economic, and social transformations that other regions may face in the coming decades.

Alaska’s Lessons

Alaska is no longer just America’s last frontier but the world’s first warning system. Its glaciers, permafrost, and ecosystems are teaching us that climate change isn’t a distant threat but a present reality. The data collected in Alaska informs climate models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and guides global policy decisions.

As scientists often say: what happens in Alaska doesn’t stay in Alaska. The state’s landscapes, rich in both beauty and evidence, reveal the story of a planet in transition and reminds us that the choices we make now will determine how that story ends.

Our precious living laboratory is under threat now more than ever. Ironically new fossil fuel drilling projects are planned across Alaska — already one of the most climate-vulnerable regions on Earth. These developments risk accelerating environmental damage further in a place that offers critical insights into our planet’s future.

So much for “at the speed of business.” Nonetheless, the governor followed up with a flurry of actions.
In northwestern Pennsylvania, the fruits of permit reform have yet to be realized in the conventional oil and gas industry.
“The Pennsylvania permitting process has not improved at all for conventional oil and gas operators,” says Tyler Martin, environmental care coordinator for Cameron Energy, in Warren County.
Robindale Energy has 20 years’ worth of fuel to fire its plants, limestone feedstock for pollution controls, and disposal space for ash.","On Aug. 12, 2024, Gov. Josh Shapiro introduced the Streamlining Permits for Economic Expansion and Development (SPEED) program, which was supposed to expedite the permitting process for businesses.

“Pennsylvanians deserve a state government that moves at the speed of business and processes their permits quickly to ensure Pennsylvanians receive a timely response,” Shapiro said.

Yet, SPEED was not as nimble as its acronym suggested. Pennsylvania’s Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), the agency responsible for SPEED, did not start accepting applications until almost one year later.

So much for “at the speed of business.”

Nonetheless, the governor followed up with a flurry of actions. By the end of summer, the administration had issued at least a half dozen news releases, claiming progress in permitting and licensing issues. The DEP website lists eight programs, all intended to improve the state’s process for handling tens of thousands of permit applications annually.

DEP’s “PAyback” program, which promises refunds of application fees if approval deadlines are missed, reported that only two approvals were overdue as of September and that no fees had been refunded since the program’s launch nearly two years ago.

Still, the impact of Pennsylvania’s permitting reform remains selective at best.

“As far as the governor’s ‘get stuff done’ marketing goes, we’ve seen no improvement in the speed of approvals for permit applications or renewals,” says Jim Panaro, executive vice president of Robindale Energy. Robindale recovers and hauls millions of tons of fuel from mine-reclamation sites to its three waste-coal power plants in southwestern Pennsylvania.

Panaro said DEP had apparently taken quicker-than-usual action on an air-quality permit for a new natural gas-fired power plant at Homer City. However, he wondered whether that would have been the case for a less “politically sensitive” project.

In northwestern Pennsylvania, the fruits of permit reform have yet to be realized in the conventional oil and gas industry.

“The Pennsylvania permitting process has not improved at all for conventional oil and gas operators,” says Tyler Martin, environmental care coordinator for Cameron Energy, in Warren County. “Sometimes there are still unnecessary delays.”

For example, the state’s process for identifying potential effects on endangered species has become more difficult, according to reports from both Martin and oil and gas driller Tim Howard from neighboring McKean County. Howard questions why his company needs to go through the process on land it already owns when there is no such requirement for a landowner building a home.

The endangered species regulation led Northampton Fuel Supply, near Wilkes-Barre, to relocate more than 2,000 cubic yards of rock, leftover from previous mining activities, to create bat habitats. “We were fortunate to have the material available,” said Hank Zielinski, Northampton’s vice president.

Regarding permits, Zielinski says DEP appears to do its best to balance conflicting demands. But staffing shortages have contributed to delays in permit renewals. He expects to test the state’s procedures when Northampton files this fall for the first time in seven years an application for a new surface-mine permit.

“My biggest concern is the retirement of experienced professionals at DEP who are familiar with the issues and share our interest in cleaning up waste-coal sites,” he said.

While Pennsylvania’s permitting successes remain limited, some glimmers of hope have been detected by Robindale Energy’s Panaro, who reports a positive “shift in attitude” on the part of federal regulators since the election of President Donald Trump. When DEP takes its lead from the new leadership at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, state regulators “have become more reasonable,” says Panaro.

For instance, two Robindale Energy plants had been under pressure to install $600 million in pollution controls based on a questionable claim that their emissions contributed to hazy air on a few days a year in Virginia and New Jersey. Panaro says “the conversation has gone away” in recent months, although regulatory agencies haven’t issued a definitive ruling yet.

Robindale Energy has 20 years’ worth of fuel to fire its plants, limestone feedstock for pollution controls, and disposal space for ash. But the regulatory certainty to assure decades of operation remains heavily dependent on the political will of state and national leaders.

But rather than deal with the ever-changing winds at the federal level, Pennsylvania lawmakers–Shapiro included–must stop paying lip service to “moving at the speed of business” and enact genuine, universal regulatory reform. No more piecemeal approach that selectively picks and chooses winners in the marketplace. No more gimmicky acronyms that don’t produce results.

Instead, Pennsylvania businesses need an efficient and predictable regulatory environment–one that genuinely moves at the speed of business.

The Oracle explains the stakes: higher temperatures disrupt eons of partnerships between the plants and animals who depend on precise cycles of temperature, nutrients and sunlight to stay alive. She reminds me the sources of food I take for granted are no exception.

She informs me the cost of our energy and food will rise at the same time we increase carbon emissions. I mention a story I saw in the Springfield Daily Citizen: Springfield City Utilities will spend $230 million in ratepayer dollars to build a new natural gas electrical generation plant.

Southwest Power Pool requiring carbon-based generation

We’re told the transmission authority we partner with (Southwest Power Pool or SPP) requires new generation to be carbon-based. Tragically, the area SPP governs is the Saudi Arabia of renewable energy: regional, unlimited, inexpensive wind and solar energy.

And so, CU is instead plowing a ton of money (and raising rates) for a facility to burn natural gas at the exact moment the U.S. is expanding natural gas shipments to Europe to replace Russian sources.

The Oracle predicts the cheap domestic price for natural gas will rise accordingly.

She asks me: Does it really matter how much you pay for a razor? The real cost over time is blades. Similarly, a $230 million capital cost is nothing compared to the cost of the pollution caused by the natural gas we will burn to meet the needs of a growing population.

I mention the fastest growing, cheapest and most reliable form of new generation around the world is solar — with wind a close second. These new sources of electricity become “base load” (reliable and predictable) when you couple them with utility scale batteries. CU did announce 36 megawatts of new batteries but for a city utility with a remarkable combination of renewable energy and low rates, their new carbon-emitting generators are a giant step backward. (Editor’s note: In 2024, City Utilities reported 34% of its delivered energy came from renewables, primarily wind. It has pledged to be “net zero carbon” by 2050.)

Let’s hope we never use it

As utility bills spike across the country, the best outcome for Springfield would be this: we bought a $230 million mistake but we will never use it.

The Oracle knows history. She predicts nothing good can come from linking our utility bills and our region’s future to a never-ending war in Europe. “Foolish humans” she murmurs over the sound of spring water bubbling over mossy boulders.

I can see she is busy with the Fall transition: leaves to colorize; turtles to burrow in the mud; wild bees to complete their nests and then perish; fur coats to thicken and seeds to drop and sleep in soil blankets.

The 11-year-old firm had been rapidly expanding over the last couple of years alongside growing market interest in lithium, copper and other minerals needed for electric vehicles and other clean-energy uses.

The layoffs include at least 40 people at Benchmark, the three sources said, out of a total workforce of 200 people. Two of the sources said affected departments included sustainability, sales and marketing.

CEO Andrew Miller in an email to Reuters said the firm had undergone a “recent restructuring.” He declined to comment further on Reuters questions regarding the reductions.

“This process is part of our ongoing efforts to strengthen the quality and delivery of Benchmark’s offering, focused around further investment in our technology and AI capabilities,” he said.

One source cited weak pricing for minerals, especially battery metal lithium, as a drag on Benchmark’s business, whose clients include miners, battery makers and politicians.

Lithium prices have plunged since their peak in 2022 due to slower-than-expected adoption of electric cars.

In a research note Benchmark published on its website last week, the company said it expected a sharp decline in U.S. EV sales in the last quarter of the year. It added that other challenges such as high manufacturing costs and rising tariffs are prompting some carmakers to scale back EV production plans into next year.

WASHINGTON, DC, UNITED STATES, October 18, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- As millions take to the streets today for 'No Kings Day'—one of the largest demonstrations in American history—the American Sustainable Business Network (ASBN) recognizes this powerful bipartisan moment and the critical work that must follow.

ASBN's summit, Business, Policy and Purpose: The Business of Democracy (October 21-23), will harness this historic momentum and channel it into concrete action through policy advocacy and democratic engagement.

""Protests are essential to democracy, but protest alone is not enough,"" said Camilla Taylor, Executive Director of ASBN. ""The energy demonstrated in our streets must translate into sustained policy advocacy to create meaningful, lasting change. It's time to work together across party lines for our democracy—and we're ready to lead the work.""

A Bipartisan Gathering for Democracy

Over three half-days (Oct 21-23, 12-3:30 PM ET), the virtual conference brings together over 80 speakers and hundreds of business leaders, policymakers, investors, and advocates in a bipartisan effort to strengthen democracy. The conference will provide tools, business networking opportunities, and strategies to turn commitment into action.

Powerhouse Speakers: Rick Steves (Rick Steves' Europe) discusses what 50 years of travel has taught him about responsible business and democracy. Paul Rice (Fair Trade USA), the original rebel in the boardroom, addresses building resilience during adversity. Jamie Ager (North Carolina Congressional candidate, Farmer) shares grassroots perspectives in challenging the status quo. Prominent women leaders include Mindy Lubber (Ceres), Fran Seegull (Impact Investing Alliance), Mia Ketterling (Pinterest), Kate Ogden (Seventh Generation), Skye Perryman (Democracy Forward), and many more.

The program was extended by the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act in 2016, and when it expired on Sept. 30, it was not renewed. Since Oct. 1, hybrid or electric vehicles are no longer allowed to use the lane without passengers.

Launched in 2006, the program was meant to incentivize more drivers to transition to “environmentally friendly, fuel-efficient vehicles to promote energy independence, lower fuel consumption, and improved air quality.” According to New York State Energy Research and Development Authority numbers, New York has over 300,000 electric vehicles on the road and millions of dollars devoted to supporting the vehicles through more charging stations and update facilities.

Sept. 30 was a big day for the electric vehicle industry, as electric vehicle tax credits, a tax break that offered a credit of up to $7,500, were also discontinued. These federal decisions remove the emphasis of electric vehicles in NY’s automotive market; meanwhile, the state is attempting to promote them. This places the state further from achieving its ambitious goal of having all new passenger cars, pickup trucks and SUVs sold in NYS be zero emissions by 2035. A gasoline-fueled passenger vehicle that drives 11,500 miles per year emits 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually.

With state actions weakened by federal moves, state resources are wasted and less efficient. Electric vehicles make up a relatively small portion of total registered vehicles–around 1%. To increase this number and thereby reduce reliance on gasoline, initiatives like the Clean Pass Program and EV tax credits were a perk for customers to spend the extra money on a hybrid or electric vehicle.

""Our goal was to really target those areas so that we can remove a lot of those diesel buses and replace those with cleaner emission vehicles.""","Thousands of diesel-powered school buses drive down Michigan roads each morning. Soon, that number will dwindle just a little, thanks to a $125 million grant from the Michigan Department of Education (MDE).

Districts across the state will receive 10 propane and 87 electric buses, which will replace older diesel-powered buses in 23 school districts.

The program is a partnership between the MDE, the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE). It's received support from environmental advocacy groups like It's Electric! and Michigan Association of Pupil Transportation (MAPT).

A third round investment of the Clean Bus Energy Grant, totaling $35.9 million, paid for the 100 additional buses.

The Environmental Protection Agency provided states with $5 billion over five years to create the Clean School Bus Program. Michigan's program was ""created after that to kind of help fill the gaps that we felt the federal program was missing,"" Kindra Weid, the Coalition Coordinator of It's Electric, said.

Public schools could apply for the grant. A primary goal of increasing the number of cleaner-powered buses was to reduce diesel emissions, which are a detriment to air quality. EGLE found which areas of the state were most polluted through mapping tool MI EJScreen, Troy Hansbarger, MDE's Manager of Office of Health Safety, said.

""Our goal was to really target those areas so that we can remove a lot of those diesel buses and replace those with cleaner emission vehicles.""

Asthma is a leading cause of absenteeism, according to the state health department. Each year, as a result of asthma, about 1 in 8 Michigan students miss more than six days of school. Diesel exhaust is a common trigger of asthma.

""And so, that's like a big driver for why we want cleaner buses,"" Weid said. ""Some kids throughout rural Michigan are on the bus for a very long time, and that means that their exposure to diesel exhaust is extensive on the drive in and the drive home.""

Katrina Morris, the executive director of MAPT, is from West Shore Educational Service District in Northwest Michigan. She transports about 130 students across distances the size of Delaware. She hopes the cleaner-powered buses will yield quieter rides, which provide a better environment for students susceptible to sound issues.

""We carry a lot of severely, multiply impaired children that have severe needs, medical needs,"" Morris said. ""And so this will help them to be able to have that safer ride, which is what we are all here for.""

Already, though, the program has faced challenges at the federal level. Districts relying on federal funding were ""left in the dark,"" Hansbarger said.

They didn't know when those funds were to be released, so they didn't know how much they had available to them. So, they didn't know how much they needed from Michigan to complete their projects.

Other districts had chosen a bus company, like Lion Electric, that stopped servicing the U.S.

Not all the cleaner-powered buses have been purchased or entered into service yet. The grant will provide a final $44 million round of investment. Applications are due Dec. 18.

Tesla Valuation Stays Steady

The Q3 2025 results report will take place next week on October 22 after the closing bell.

Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) ended the week at $439.31 share, extending a consistent climb to more than 6% this year and 95% over the past 12 months. Does Wall Street strength indicate that Tesla might exceed what had been cautious forecasts for Q3 2025? Once-dour Tesla analyst expressions seem to be slightly revised, with some projecting Tesla will report third-quarter earnings per share of $0.54, down from $0.72 a year earlier.

Tesla delivered 497,099 cars (481,166 Model 3/Y and 15,933 other models) worldwide in the third quarter, setting a new record. The figure rose 7.4% from the year-ago quarter, after three consecutive quarters of year-over-year decline.

How will the new, basic Tesla Model Y and Model 3 versions stabilize numbers? Tesla has finally begun to appeal to a less affluent audience by introducing new so-called Standard versions of the Model 3 sedan and Model Y SUV priced $5,000–$5,500 less than before.

Tesla continues to be the best selling EVs in the US market, estimated at 43.1% at the end of September. Yes, those numbers are down from 49% Y2Y. The EV competition is knocking at the Austin door, shrinking Tesla’s share of the EV pie to 41% from 80% four years ago. BloombergNEF expects at least nine new electric cars and trucks priced below $40,000 in the next three years.

US residents bought 438,500 electric cars and trucks in the third quarter, as drivers raced to grab federal incentives before they expired September 30. Those sales became the highest number of EVs sold in a single quarter, amounting to 11% of all new car sales and beating the previous high point of 8.7%, according to Cox Automotive. It’s also interesting to note that nearly half of US EV purchases in the first half of the year were made without any federal incentive.

The federal tax credits did help rejuvenate Tesla. Its overall financial health equation continues to be fortified by strong brand loyalty. With earlier quarters on a roller coaster, it hasn’t hurt that Musk recently added about $1 billion worth of Tesla stock.

Tesla is positioned to look to its increasing energy generation and storage revenues as sustaining factors. The Megapack and Powerwall products continue to grow in popularity. In the third quarter of 2025, Tesla deployed 12.5 GWh of energy storage, reflecting an increase from 6.9 GWh in the corresponding quarter of 2024 and setting a new record.

But, on the less optimistic side, did a consumer rush to cash in on the credits artificially inflate Tesla value in Q3? Loss of EV federal tax incentives may have an effect on the upcoming quarter’s bottom line — the Tesla Q4 2025 report may look very different. The stock is up more than 7% for the year, but some analysts interpret that as a fleeting moment in time. Pessimists see Q4 with a stark Tesla revenue drop, which will feed into 2025 becoming the company’s first full-year decline on record.

One downward trend is Tesla’s lukewarm performance abroad. While Tesla doesn’t officially break down sales by region, as Yahoo! finance notes, the third-quarter jump is likely to have come from the US. In Europe, however, the company’s performance is flaccid, with demand on the rise from both legacy automakers and Chinese EV players.

Tesla shares did fall early in the year due to brand competition, but Musk’s boorish behavior had the most significant detrimental effect. Clearly, siding with anti-EV Trump, his DOGE damage to federal careers and alleged data theft, and his outspoken support of Germany’s AfD party pushed Tesla stock to new lows.

The market for used EVs is also booming and could become an offsetting factor in new EV sales.

Musk’s Pay Package: Back in the Courts

This week the Delaware Supreme Court heard another iteration of arguments about Musk’s record-setting pay package. The saga began in 2018. In lieu of a salary, Tesla gave Musk incentives to help the company grow and prosper at the rate of 10× that year’s valuation. Tesla states that Musk, indeed, met those goals in 2022.

But not everyone was impressed. The Tesla board of directors was accused of violating their fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of shareholders and the company overall. With so much board influence, the thought was that the board couldn’t objectively analyze Musk’s actual performance. A lack of alleged board transparency about informing shareholders also fed into the case, with various board members’ personal ties to Musk not fully revealed.

Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) has recommended that Tesla investors vote against Musk’s colossal pay package, describing it as ‘excessive’ and insufficiently tied to safeguards for shareholders.

Judge Kathaleen McCormick determined that the amount to be awarded Musk was an “unfathomable sum,” and she instructed Tesla to rethink the compensation package. Shareholders in 2024 didn’t listen and passed it again. The volley back to McCormick didn’t work out as shareholders wished, as she rejected that vote, too. A new vote, she stated, wasn’t what she asked for: developing a new plan.

Now it’s up to Delaware’s State Supreme Court. Could it be construed that Musk influenced the board but did not control it?

Tesla’s board of directors now has a new, future compensation package on the table for Musk. Hear ye, hear ye: all bow to the world’s first trillionaire.

Here are the best ten EV lease deals in October 2025.
However, the lease rate in this case is $551 per month over 48 months, with $8,510 due at signing.","The removal of the EV tax credit was thought to pose an existential threat to the adoption of electric vehicles in the US. The sentiment was even more acute because many legacy carmakers had signaled they wanted to scale back their EV plans way before the tax credit ended. However, many people will continue to purchase EVs in the future, and the adoption rate is expected to accelerate.

Not all carmakers are on board with electrification, but those who bet on EVs will reap the benefits. This might explain why many appear unfazed by the new market conditions. There are still great deals on EVs, and more pop up every day. Some carmakers have adjusted to the new reality by cutting the prices of their EVs, as they tried to compensate for the loss of the tax credit.

Hyundai is a prime example, with the 2026 Ioniq 5 starting at $35,000 and significant discounts offered on the 2025 models. Others bet on more affordable models launching into the market, such as the Chevrolet Bolt and Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y Standard.

The Detroit Three carmakers believed they could circumvent the system by purchasing the EVs directly through their financing subsidiaries. This way, they could access the federal tax credit and pass the savings on to the customer. However, this approach, while creative, backfired spectacularly when the government fought back. They have since stopped offering the tax credit savings and, in some cases, sold the vehicles through auctions.

Another reason we continue to see very tempting offers is that carmakers anticipate slow sales in the fourth quarter. Traditionally one of the best in a year, the Q4 2025 could be flat at best. That's because the expiration date on the EV tax credit prompted many who intended to buy an EV this year to do it in the third quarter. As a result, fewer people will buy a new EV in the fourth quarter.

We may not see lease contracts with monthly payments as low as $89 or $129 as we did in the past months, mainly because there will not be a tax credit to lower the costs. However, we've still found many attractive deals, with monthly payments as low as $189 for the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 6, both in SE Standard Range specifications. Here are the best ten EV lease deals in October 2025.

1. 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 SE SR

MSRP: from $44,075

Lease: from $189 for 36 months with $3,999 due at signing

The 2025 Ioniq 5 RWD SE SR model can be leased for just $189 per month over 36 months, with $3,999 due at signing. However, I urge you to consider the SE trim for a monthly rate of $199. For only $10 more per month, you get a significantly improved EV.

Instead of a 63-kWh battery providing a maximum range of 245 miles (394 km), the SE model features an 84-kWh battery pack, offering a maximum range of 318 miles (512 km). It also offers 225 horsepower, up from 168 horsepower, for the SE SR model.

Thanks to its impressive feature package, the Ioniq 5 is easily the most popular Hyundai EV. As the first model built on Hyundai's E-GMP platform, the Ioniq 5 introduced the 800-volt architecture to the masses. The main benefit is crazy-fast charging, with less than 20 minutes needed to charge from 10% to 80% when using an 800-volt DC fast charger.

2. 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 6 SE SR

MSRP: from $39,045

Lease: from $189 for 24 months with $3,999 due at signing

This funny-looking electric sedan shares the E-GMP platform with the Ioniq 5 below but adds the benefit of an aerodynamically optimized body. The Ioniq 6 boasts an impressive 0.22 drag coefficient, which is why it offers one of the longest ranges in its segment, at 342 miles (550 km). That, of course, if it's equipped with the bigger 77-kWh battery.

If the lower range (240 mi/386 km) suits your driving habits, Hyundai offers a deal on the Ioniq 6 RWD SE Standard Range. You can have it for $189 per month for 24 months, with $3,999 due at signing. For the money, you'll get a single-motor configuration with 149 horsepower and a 53-kWh battery, good for 240 miles (386 km) of range.

However, it's better to upgrade to the full EV package for $10 more per month. The Ioniq 6 SE retains the RWD configuration but with a 225-hp motor and a range estimated at 342 miles (550 km). For these benefits, the small surcharge is well worth paying.

3. 2025 Kia Niro EV Wind

MSRP: from $41,045

Lease: from $209 for 24 months with $3,999 due at signing

The Kia Niro EV is not the newest or most compelling EV, but it's worth considering at these rates. The entry-level 2025 Niro EV Wind can be leased for $209 per month over 24 months, with $3,999 due at signing. It's a lot more than it used to be for an arguably inferior EV compared to the two Hyundai EVs, but you can't be too picky these days.

The 2025 Kia Niro was launched last November, following a thorough revision in 2022. Although a little long in the tooth, the Niro EV Wind offers a decent 253-mile (407 km) range from a 65-kWh battery. The Niro EV doesn't have a heat pump fitted as standard, so be sure to purchase it with the Preserve Package ($1,300).

On the plus side, the equipment is rich, even in the Wind base trim. This includes dual 10.25-inch screens for the instrument cluster and infotainment system, an eight-speaker audio system from Harman Kardon, and a bi-tone interior theme for the Wave top trim. A comprehensive driver-assist package is also standard, making the Niro EV a compelling proposition.

4.2025 Ford Mustang Mach-E Select RWD

MSRP: from $32,435

Lease: from $219 for 24 months with $4,499 due at signing

Ford is losing money on every EV it sells, but that hasn't stopped it from selling its electric vehicles at very attractive prices. This likely explains why sales have increased recently, despite strong competition from Tesla, GM, and Hyundai/Kia. The 2025 Mustang Mach-E is now available with a very attractive lease contract.

The electric Mustang can be leased for $219 per month with $4,499 due at signing on a 24-month contract. There's a mileage limit of 21,000 miles for the duration of the contract, with each extra mile costing $0.20. The low monthly rate is made possible by an $8,750 incentive package that is applied to the sticker price.

In its heyday, the compact crossover has been praised as one of the best rivals to the Tesla Model Y. The Select RWD trim offers a respectable 264 horsepower, and the 73-kWh standard-range battery allows it to travel up to 260 miles (418 km) on a charge. Charging the battery from 10% to 80% takes 32 minutes.

5. 2025 Subaru Solterra Premium

MSRP: from $39,915

Lease: from $279 for 36 months with $2,278 due at signing

The 2025 Subaru Solterra still has a very attractive lease offer at $279 per month on a 36-month contract. This expires on October 31 and is available in all states except Hawaii. Although Subaru has already announced the 2026 model, it is not yet available for order.

If the 2025 Solterra looks familiar, it's because it's a Toyota bZ4X in disguise. Surprisingly, Subaru opted for a more radical redesign with the 2026 model. The changes are equally thorough under the hood, where it has incorporated the latest technology introduced by the newer Toyota bZ.

The 2025 Subaru Solterra charges from 10% to 80% in 35 minutes, which is still slower than most EVs. Subaru packs Eye-Sight with supervised hands-free driving at speeds up to 25 mph (40 kph) as standard, as well as standard roof rails with a static load capacity rated up to 700 pounds (318 kg).

6. 2025 VinFast VF 8 Eco

MSRP: from $41,100

Lease: from $279 for 24 months with $0 due at signing

VinFast is a Vietnamese carmaker that vowed to upend the US car market. However, its EVs have been harshly criticized for poor build quality and software problems. Hopefully, the carmaker has solved most of these issues. The good news is that VinFast lowered the price of the VF8, partly offsetting the loss of the tax credit.

The electric crossover retails for $41,100 in the Eco trim, compared to $47,200 previously. This makes the lease offer interesting, at $279 monthly for 24 months with a $0 downpayment. VinFast also offers a 10-year/125,000-mile bumper-to-bumper warranty and a 10-year/unlimited-mile battery warranty, providing peace of mind.

For the money, you get a Tesla Model Y-sized crossover with a standard dual-motor configuration. The Eco base variant delivers 349 horsepower, while the 87.7-kWh battery pack allows it to travel up to 256 miles (412 km) on a charge. Not quite impressive, considering that the $48,990 Tesla Model Y AWD offers 327 miles (526 km).

7. 2025 Chevrolet Equinox EV 2WD LT

MSRP: from $43,295

Lease: from $279 for 24 months with $2,229 due at signing

Surprisingly, the Chevrolet Equinox retains the monthly payments of the tax-credit era, although the downpayment has increased. At $279 per month with $2,229 due at signing, this is still a good deal. You can have it if you take delivery by October 31.

The Chevrolet Equinox EV 2WD LT has a front-wheel drive and an 85 kW battery capable of keeping the car going for 319 miles (513 km) on a charge. The battery can be charged at 150 kW, adding up to 77 miles of range in 10 minutes of charging. An optional eAWD variant with a range of 285 miles (460 km) is also offered.

While the Chevy Equinox EV looks compelling on paper, it also has the disadvantage of less polished software. GM likely ironed out many issues lately. However, it's still not on par with the industry benchmark Tesla, which makes the lack of support for Android Auto/Apple CarPlay even more painful.

8. 2025 Honda Prologue AWD Touring

MSRP: from $56,195

Lease: from $289 for 36 months with $3,899 due at signing

The 2025 Honda Prologue AWD Touring starts at $289 per month on a 36-month contract in California and other ZEV states, with $3,899 due at signing. The offer is available to owners of non-luxury car brands that are model year 2010 or newer.

For this money, you get the ""Japanese"" variant of the Chevrolet Blazer EV, sharing similar drivetrain and battery components. The Touring AWD trim features a dual-motor configuration powered by an 85-kWh battery pack, allowing it up to 294 miles (473 km) on a charge.

The Honda Prologue has a substantial advantage over its Chevy counterpart, primarily due to the support for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto that GM does not offer on its EVs. Honda claims the longest wheelbase in its class (121.8 in/3,094 mm), providing impressive cabin space.

9. 2025 Kia EV6 Light LR

MSRP: from $47,695

Lease: from $309 for 24 months with $3,999 due at signing

This costs significantly more to lease than the Kia Niro EV, but it's well worth the price. However, its biggest competitor is its Hyundai cousin, the Ioniq 5, which is much cheaper to lease. Ultimately, it comes down to how much you like the EV6's polarizing design.

The 2025 Kia EV6 Long Range RWD model in the Light trim is available for $309 per month, with $3,999 due at signing for a 24-month contract. The powertrain develops 225 horsepower from a single-motor configuration. Thanks to an 84-kWh battery pack, it can go up to 319 miles (513 km) on a charge.

The Kia EV6 boasts very short charging times when plugged into a 350-kW charger, needing only 20 minutes to charge from 10% to 80%. This is as fast as you can get on a volume model and is one of its unique selling points. As a family model, you might consider the Hyundai Ioniq 5, which offers a larger trunk. However, the Kia EV6 scores better in sportiness.

10. 2025 Ford F-150 Lightning XLT

MSRP: from $55,135

Lease: from $321 for 24 months with $6,915 due at signing

This incredible offer speaks volumes about what Ford is willing to do to sell its electric pickup truck. Although the $6,915 due at signing is rather steep, the $321 monthly payment is almost nothing for an electric truck well-equipped like the F-150 Lightning XLT.

Its only letdown is that it comes with the Standard Range battery (98 kWh), which can only go 240 miles (386 km) on a charge. If you want the most range, you'll have to splurge on the F-150 Lightning Lariat. However, the lease rate in this case is $551 per month over 48 months, with $8,510 due at signing.

Thanks to an Extended Range battery with a 131-kWh capacity, the Lariat variant can go up to 320 miles (515 km) on a charge. Even this is not enough if you want to use the truck for towing. This might explain why the electric F-150 is not as popular as its combustion-powered brother.",https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/the-tax-credit-is-gone-but-electric-car-lease-deals-are-as-sweet-as-ever-in-october-2025-259402_1.jpeg,N,,2025-10-18 14:04:11.203876

What Is the EV Tax Credit?

Part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, the EV tax credit incentivized new car buyers to purchase EVs by giving them a $7,500 tax credit when buying a qualifying new EV. For instance, a new $40,000 EV would ultimately cost $32,500 after the $7,500 was claimed. It was a healthy incentive, covering a significant portion of a new EV’s final cost. That incentive has now been eliminated by the OBBBA.

That’s not the only pricing issue currently facing EVs.

Tariffs Are Keeping EVs Expensive

As reported by Business Insider, even the standard versions of Tesla’s Model 3 and Model Y are no longer cheap at $36,990 and $39,990 respectively. A crucial reason for this is that many of the necessary minerals needed to construct EV batteries are both mined and processed in China, where they face a 93.5% tariff tax to come to America.

Imposing not only a steep tariff but also one with unpredictable terms makes planning extremely difficult, Travis Fisher, director of energy and environmental policy studies at the Cato Institute, told Business Insider. He also said if he were in the auto industry, considering production of electric or hybrid models and the integration of multiple batteries, he’d be unsure how to proceed.

Experts Weigh In: Are EVs Still Worth Buying?

Should you still consider an EV, even without the tax credit? According to Dave Thomas, director of content marketing and auto industry analyst at CDK Global, the answer is a hesitant yes. “If you are truly concerned [about] how much you will be paying out of pocket for the next five years, EVs will mostly likely still be the right pick,” he said.

“Many [automakers] are discounting EVs by $7,500 to offset the loss of the incentives. If you search your local dealership’s inventory you might find some with significantly bigger discounts,” Thomas explained.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Vnl3dPwxH6znN192dtBfBw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/gobankingrates_644/a599228de6616a2733d6c7be1b4589e2,N,,2025-10-18 13:02:03.643222

The COP 30 Circle of Finance Ministers, coordinated by Fernando Haddad, Brazil’s finance minister (pictured), set out five priorities which it will present at the summit in Belem in November.
The other four are: reform multilateral development banks; boost domestic capacity for climate finance; find ways to mobilise private capital; and strengthen regulation of climate finance.
“Every year of delayed climate action raises both the investment needed and the risks faced,” the ministers said.
“Climate action is central to both economic stability and development,” said Matia Kasaija, Ugandan finance minister and co-chair of the Coalition.","If financial leaders act urgently to increase climate investments they could unlock a $1tr-a-year growth opportunity that would create hundreds of millions of jobs and protect lives, according to three reports on Thursday.

Two separate alliances of finance ministers called for climate finance to be magnified to the 2035 target of $1.3tr a year set by last year’s COP 29 climate summit.

Meanwhile, a consortium of 20 thinktanks, NGOs and universities said investment in climate resilience and nature projects could create more than 280m jobs in emerging and developing countries by 2035, boosting the most vulnerable states’ economies by as much as 15%.

The COP 30 Circle of Finance Ministers, coordinated by Fernando Haddad, Brazil’s finance minister (pictured), set out five priorities which it will present at the summit in Belem in November.

It said mobilising finance to hit $1.3tr would require “structured and sustained efforts” by public and private bodies. Its top priority is to scale up concessional finance and make best use of climate funds. The other four are: reform multilateral development banks; boost domestic capacity for climate finance; find ways to mobilise private capital; and strengthen regulation of climate finance.

The Circle, which includes countries as diverse as the UK and the Marshall Islands, said inaction on climate change disproportionately exposed the most vulnerable populations — which had contributed least to emissions — to “escalating climate risks”.

“Every year of delayed climate action raises both the investment needed and the risks faced,” the ministers said. “Urgent and coordinated action is indispensable to safeguard lives, livelihoods and sustainable growth.”

Meanwhile, the older 70-strong Coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action issued a strong case for the economic benefits of tackling global warming.

They said the pro-climate policies Coalition members had enacted had enabled their economies to seize opportunities from the transition to a low carbon, climate-resilient economy.

“Climate action is central to both economic stability and development,” said Matia Kasaija, Ugandan finance minister and co-chair of the Coalition. “Finance ministries [are] playing a more pertinent role in climate policies — aligning fiscal policy with climate priorities… and working towards a more predictable environment for unlocking the investment needed.”

The Coalition has published a database of more than 500 climate policy actions by member countries. It showed that two thirds of countries were scaling up green bonds, emissions trading systems and blended finance to mobilise private capital for climate action. One in seven was integrating climate risks into public financial management while one in 10 was introducing carbon taxes, phasing out harmful subsidies and expanding clean energy incentives.

“By aligning fiscal and general financial policies with climate objectives, we can create clear, predictable frameworks that attract investment, support innovation and ensure the transition strengthens — not destabilises — our economies,” said Marko Primorac, incoming co-chair and Croatia’s finance minister.

The Returns on Resilience report, launched by 20 partners, analysed the economic and financial benefits of investment in climate adaptation. It found that the adaptation and resilience market could reach $1.3tr annually by 2030, while saving some of the 1m-2m additional deaths expected annually by 2050 without action.

The report also calculated the cost of failing to act. Temperature and rainfall shifts have already destroyed at least $525bn of economic expansion over the past 20 years in developing nations.

Launching the report, Mia Mottley, prime minister of Barbados and architect of the Bridgetown Initiative on climate finance reform, said: “We continue to recognise that the work of building resilience is at the core of everything that we do.”

Without intervention, both sudden disasters and gradual environmental changes like biodiversity decline could cost major global corporations $1.2tr by the 2050s, amid a worldwide GDP reduction of 18% to 23%.

Despite the evidence, capital still flows in the wrong direction, the report warned.

Reports from industry experts state that Europe hit record wind power curtailments during the first nine months of 2025. The world’s leaders have reaffirmed the need to diversify the energy sector; however, the troubling trend that has emerged in Europe points to some concerning issues that European nations will need to contend with to shift the sector towards a more inclusive stance for the wind power sector.

European grids were unable to dispatch the surge in renewable energy output during this year

The progress that the global community has made in advancing the wind sector beyond memorandum’s of understanding towards the practical implementation of projects that drive the sector forward.

While that progress is commendable, a worrying trend has emerged in Europe. When a situation arises where renewable energy output threatens to overwhelm grids, operators are often paid to reduce generation from their renewable energy assets. This has led to Europe hitting record wind power curtailments during the first nine months of 2025.

Curtialment rates have risen in several nations, including Spain, Germany, France, and southern Sweden during the first nine months of the year, underscoring the issues faced by the wind power sector in the region. Among the worrying increases in curtailment rates are:

Spain jumped to 12.2% this year from 9% last year

France increased to 5.3% from 3.8%

Germany’s curtailment rate inched up to 4.9% from 4.5%

South Sweden’s curtailment rate was 2.4%, up from 2.0% a year earlier

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said last month that the EU plans to address critical grid bottlenecks, which have exacerbated the curtailment rates in the region.

A review of the EU’s electricity grids by the European Court of Auditors has outlined the required budget for the sector

The estimation that the EU Commission has laid out notes that $2.36 trillion to $2.7 trillion is required to meet grid needs until 2050; without it, the sector will face significant shortages that could devastate the region.

President Ursula von der Leyen notes that European nations’ national grids are not well integrated, as they lack the necessary interconnectors. The curtailment rates in Europe are the polar opposite of what is taking place in the MENA region, which has seen Africa’s largest wind farm being completed ahead of schedule.

Industry insiders have echoed the problems being faced in Europe.

“Less new wind is bad news for Europe’s wider competitiveness. Industry in Europe is craving cheap electricity to compete with China and the US. But too many Governments remain half-hearted in their expansion of wind. This is not only threatening the wind sector. It’s also jeopardising jobs and growth more widely – in steel, chemicals and ICT. Doing business in Europe is so much harder for them if the EU can’t deliver on its energy targets” – WindEurope CEO, Giles Dickson

However, an innovative social enterprise is doing its bit to help by offering people the chance to reduce their electricity bills by as much as 30%.

Energy Local is a non-profit organisation that has created a way for people to benefit from local clean energy by teaming up with a renewable energy project in their area – it might be a wind turbine, solar farm or hydroelectric scheme – to get a better deal.

It enables participating residents to buy renewable electricity at a discounted price.

They form a club, which their local renewable project also joins, and it works by matching up the residents’ energy usage to the locally generated electricity. The club agrees a price residents will pay for the electricity they use when the local renewable energy is being generated.

In Bridport in Dorset, the installation of a wind turbine by the local farmer Peter Bailey in one of his fields allowed an energy club to be set up in 2021. Almost 60 people are signed up to the club, and the connection between local energy generation and usage is already having an impact on how members behave.

“Peter believes wind power of about 11mph produces sufficient power for it to generate. You know on a windy day that it’s generating power,” says Malcolm Drew, a semi-retired engineer and energy club member.

“The website we can access tells us what the turbine is doing – it picks up on wind speed and tells you how windy it is and if it’s a good time to use electricity,” he adds.

Richard Toft, who helped to found the club, says: “We’re all saving. Depending on your personal habits, people save a different proportion – anywhere between a 10% and 25% reduction on your bill.”

There are many more people interested in joining the Bridport club than available spaces but there are hopes that it can set up a solar farm based on a cooperative investment model to expand the project and allow more members to join.

Energy Local was set up by Dr Mary Gillie in 2016 after she witnessed a surprising frustration among people living in Ashton Hayes, Cheshire, who wanted their small village to become carbon neutral.

“They said: ‘Can we all just put solar power on our roofs? How do we then say that we’ve used that power?’” Gillie says.

“But at the time, we couldn’t show when they were using it. It was when smart meters began to be developed that I realised we could do that.”

There are now 36 energy clubs across Great Britain that Energy Local is involved with, stretching from Scotland down to Devon and Dorset. The idea behind them is simple. Thanks to smart meter technology, it is now possible to show how much electricity a household uses every half an hour. Energy Local has developed software that compares that usage with the electricity generated by a local renewable energy scheme such as a wind turbine, hydro project or solar farm.

Gillie and her team have worked with energy companies to negotiate a special tariff arrangement, thereby creating a “hyper-local” market that acknowledges the renewable power being generated in that area.

The price the club members pay for the electricity they use when the local clean energy is being generated is higher than the amount the renewable energy projects would normally get from selling their power to suppliers but lower than the price residents would usually pay via a regular tariff. “It’s a win-win,” Gillie says.

In Brixton, south London, Energy Local has helped unlock the potential of an existing solar project on the roof of a social housing block called Roupell Park. The photovoltaic panels on the building’s roof were installed in 2013 thanks to a community investment initiative organised by the not-for-profit organisation Repowering London.

“Everyone, as investor members, owns a piece of that kit on the roof [in Roupell Park],” says Afsheen Kabir Rashid, the co-founder and chief executive of Repowering London.

“It’s really empowering for local people. But we kept coming back to this point: how can we supply this energy locally? Energy Local has been one of the models that has allowed us to do that.

“It’s a small trial in Brixton – 18 households or so – but they have seen benefits on their energy bills already.”

Repowering London raises money for the solar panels through community shares. It believes that democratising the energy system is the fastest route to decarbonising the sector and making it fairer. “We still have huge fuel poverty in the UK,” Kabir Rashid says. “People are scared about the bills that arrive. People are disconnected from where the energy is coming from. The benefits of the extractive fossil fuel economy do not stay local in people’s pockets. But through community energy, we can bring people closer, make it visible.”

When the sun is weak or there is no wind, the energy club members have to pay a higher tariff – however, part of the aim of Energy Local is to encourage people to change their consumption habits.

Gillie says that as well as trying to support local renewable energy and reduce people’s bills, “we want to manage the electricity network as efficiently as we can … If we can get people to use more power when local generation is running or when fewer people are using it, we can solve both problems.”

Electricity demand is typically greatest between 4pm and 8pm but Energy Local encourages participants to set timers for washing machines and similar devices, and to try to move energy-intensive tasks to the times of day when local clean power generation is running at maximum levels and electricity is at its cheapest.

While the idea of hyper-local energy markets and cooperative renewable power generation may sound like a perfect solution to the energy crisis, Gillie is clear that community energy schemes cannot replace the national grid entirely.

“We need a robust overarching system to ensure the power keeps flowing,” she says. “We do as much as we can locally, but after a point [infrastructure costs] can become too expensive, and that’s where you need things to be handled at a national level.”

Those infrastructure costs, such as repairing and upgrading the cables and equipment that electrify our homes and businesses, are one reason why bills, including standing charges, have just gone up. On 1 October, the average energy price cap for households in Great Britain paying by direct debit increased by £35 to £1,755 for a typical annual dual-fuel bill.

“Our network is changing – we need to invest in it. We should have done this 15 years ago, and we’re playing catchup on a massive scale,” Gillie says.

Given the desire within the industry to wean the grid off gas turbine power stations and lower consumer prices by bringing more renewable power into play, well-integrated local energy generation sites offer a glimpse of what a more efficient, carbon neutral network may look like in the future.

How do Energy Local clubs work, and how do I join one?

They are designed to solve a problem in the electricity market: renewable energy schemes sell their power to suppliers but people living nearby are buying that electricity back for maybe two or three times that price.

An Energy Local club is legally a cooperative and is where a group of residents and a local renewable energy project team up to get a better deal for both parties.

To take part, you need a smart meter installed in your home.

The club agrees a price people will pay for the electricity they use when renewable energy is being generated locally. So they may want to run their washing machine when they know the local hydro scheme is going full pelt, for example. Sometimes it will be possible to match all the electricity someone uses to locally generated power but at other times they will use more than is available. For the extra electricity, they will be charged at different rates depending on the time of day.

The club selects a partner energy supplier that sells the extra power that members need when there is not enough local electricity generated. So those taking part will have to change to the supplier selected.

Energy Local says the savings will vary from household to household but adds: “We estimate you could save about 10% to 30% on your electricity bills.” However, club members still have to pay standing charges.

The organisation has created an online dashboard to help people manage their energy use. It can provide a forecast of how much power will come from the local renewable energy source each day.

If you would like to join an Energy Local club, there is a list on the organisation’s website of clubs that are up and running or being set up (some are now full). If there isn’t one in your area but you would like to be notified if one is set up, there is a form on the site where you can register your details. “We have clubs developing in many areas. Please let us know you are interested,” the organisation says.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f432609de10e14df0dc391db3955f37292e1a85/802_449_3466_2774/master/3466.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=48b025ac2dd3200ab32b6fc13361a0ca",N,,2025-10-18 12:09:49.260557

Short-sighted disposal practices, meant to cheaply handle large volumes of wastewater, have led directly to increased operational expenses for everyone operating in these basins.
The immediate challenge stems from massive volumes of produced wastewater being injected into underground formations at increasingly high pressures.
Operators in East Texas commonly injected wastewater into mid-depth formations such as the Rodessa-Gloyd interval, between 4,500 and 7,500 feet deep.
Today, many injection wells are pumping wastewater at pressures above the natural fracture gradient, unintentionally fracturing formations and allowing pressurized wastewater to migrate upward and laterally into unintended zones.","The shale industry is facing an entirely predictable consequence of its own making. Across major shale-producing basins, particularly East Texas and the Permian, excessive wastewater injection practices have created areas with extreme overpressure, driving up the cost of new drilling operations and threatening the economic viability of shale production in many locations. It’s also destroying fresh water aquifers, causing earthquakes and causing whack-a-mole poisonous salt geysers, but apparently that’s not so big a concern in the state.

The irony is clear. Short-sighted disposal practices, meant to cheaply handle large volumes of wastewater, have led directly to increased operational expenses for everyone operating in these basins. This industry-wide phenomenon is effectively a textbook example of the tragedy of the commons, but hitting the oil and gas industry in its pocket book instead of regular joes. Would that climate change had the same level of attention, concern and impact.

The immediate challenge stems from massive volumes of produced wastewater being injected into underground formations at increasingly high pressures. Historically, shale producers viewed wastewater disposal as an inexpensive side operation, a cost line item small enough to remain mostly unnoticed on balance sheets. Operators in East Texas commonly injected wastewater into mid-depth formations such as the Rodessa-Gloyd interval, between 4,500 and 7,500 feet deep.

Over the years, this led to the gradual but steady buildup of subsurface pressures. Today, many injection wells are pumping wastewater at pressures above the natural fracture gradient, unintentionally fracturing formations and allowing pressurized wastewater to migrate upward and laterally into unintended zones. As pressure increases, the operational complexity of drilling new wells escalates dramatically.

The direct operational impacts are now clearly visible. Operators face increasingly frequent challenges when drilling into these overpressured formations. Elevated…",https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/1*SNxBV7_zil-z4JXYQWw0_A.png,N,,2025-10-18 16:03:52.599936

Republican candidate for governor Brian Shortsleeve said Healey had driven up energy costs by opposing gas pipelines and supporting fees and mandates that add to energy costs.","The order directs the Department of Public Utilities to eliminate, reduce, or mitigate any charges that do not benefit ratepayers.

Healey also urged the department to speed up the connection of solar resources to the grid before a federal tax credit expires.

The directive comes as residents face high energy costs and the state's utility regulation department undergoes leadership changes.

Gov. Maura Healey ordered utilities regulators Tuesday to start combing through gas and electric bill charges line by line to reduce or remove any that don't provide a benefit to ratepayers as they gird for the winter heating season.

""Everybody knows what we're dealing with. It's not just a Massachusetts issue, it's a problem throughout the Northeast, and we've just got to act with just incredible urgency to do everything we can to lower costs. And that means this as well, looking at bills, looking at charges, and getting rid of charges that aren't justified, that aren't providing that customer benefit,"" the governor said.

The order to the Department of Public Utilities, delivered in a letter Tuesday, calls for the department to ""review each and every charge that customers are currently paying to determine whether the charge can be eliminated, reduced or its impact mitigated."" Healey also instructed the DPU to ""rigorously review"" the rate increases proposed by utilities ""to avoid unnecessary spending and drive down costs.""

Energy bills soared for many Bay Staters last winter, exacerbating chronic cost-of-living pressures for residents and businesses that already pay some of the highest energy prices in the country and calling attention to the state clean energy and climate mandates some say are driving elevated costs. Healey already shaved $50 off April electricity bills and in March announced a series of executive actions designed to spur savings of nearly $6 billion over the next five years.

Healey said the actions she announced Tuesday add to her energy affordability agenda, which includes major legislation that fellow Democrats have been largely cool towards. The governor did not attach a timeline to her order and did not directly answer when asked if she expects that DPU would be able to take action in time to influence this winter's heating bills.

""I made my request today to the DPU. I think this is something they've got to get after right away,"" she responded during a press conference in her office. She added, ""The bottom line is that gas and electric bills are too high, too volatile, for people in the Northeast, and so we're doing everything we can within our power to cut them down.""

Energy and Environmental Affairs Secretary Rebecca Tepper said it is infrastructure and supply costs that are driving the increases in gas and electric bills.

""So what this does is to look at all the charges -- including looking at the utilities and how they're spending money on infrastructure -- and making sure that we're using it as efficiently as we can, the stuff we currently have, and that we're building stuff in a way that's the most cost effective,"" she said.

In her letter to the DPU, the governor also urged the department to hasten its proceedings that are necessary for more solar resources to connect to the grid so that Bay Staters can take advantage before the federal residential clean energy tax credit is eliminated at the end of the year.

""Massachusetts ratepayers cannot afford to lose out on the cheapest and fastest energy that can get built,"" Healey said.

Republican candidate for governor Brian Shortsleeve said Healey had driven up energy costs by opposing gas pipelines and supporting fees and mandates that add to energy costs.

""On Day One in office, I’ll end the mandates and hidden taxes that made our bills skyrocket and make affordability the driving factor in our energy policy,"" Shortsleeve said in a statement.

Healey's order to the DPU arrives to a department in flux. The governor in August announced her second shake-up of the DPU membership in about two and a half years, and that transition is in progress.

Cecile Fraser, an energy and utilities industry attorney first appointed to the DPU in 2017, was replaced last month by Jeremy McDiarmid, who had been running the national business association Advanced Energy United. Next week, Liz Anderson, the chief of the Energy and Ratepayer Advocacy Division in Attorney General Andrea Campbell's office, will take Chairman James Van Nostrand's spot as a commissioner and McDiarmid will become chair of the DPU.

These practices echo a growing body of research showing that solar projects can improve soil health and local biodiversity when managed right.","SAVANNAH, Ga.—Imagine driving past a solar farm and underneath the panels, you see a field of yellow flowers dancing in the wind.

Soil scientist Christina Hebb asked a room of solar developers to picture this scene at a conference here last week of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), the nonprofit that advocates for the solar industry.

“Planting flowering species help re-establish pollinator habitat and increase pollinator species that not only benefits the site but will increase production and crop yields for neighbouring properties. So it’s very helpful, not to mention people driving past the solar farm and they’re like, ‘Wow, that actually looks really good,’” said Hebb.

Hebb works to manage the soil of solar projects planned, built and managed by the company she works for, McCarthy Building Companies, which develops and constructs large-scale solar projects across the country, often on former farmland.

As the United States builds and maintains more solar farms, attention is turning to how to make them more sustainable. Much of that focus is on the ground beneath the panels, where developers are learning how to manage soil to meet permit requirements, reduce costs and protect the land. Hebb saw this shift firsthand after joining McCarthy as its in-house soil scientist in 2021, following years as a consultant.

Expanding solar farms reshape landscapes and nearby communities. Building them can clear vegetation and compact soil, disturbing drainage, crops and ecosystems. More developers now recognize that healthy soil supports both local livelihoods and the durability of their projects.

Flowers help keep weeds from overtaking the soil beneath solar panels, making it easier for maintenance crews to work safely and reducing the risk of fire. But planting flowers is only one of many steps developers can take to make solar farms more sustainable.

Some solar farms have planted low-growing grasses that sheep graze on, keeping vegetation in check while providing local farmers with pasture income. Others have introduced barn owls to hunt prey that chew on wires and nest inside electrical equipment, showing how tending to both the surface and the soil can make solar energy systems more resilient.

In the Southwest, researchers have found that growing crops beneath solar panels can help both plants and panels thrive. Shade from the panels protects crops from extreme heat while moisture from the vegetation cools the panels and boosts their efficiency. Farmers in Arizona and Colorado have reported higher yields and lower irrigation needs in these so-called “agrivoltaic” systems.

These practices echo a growing body of research showing that solar projects can improve soil health and local biodiversity when managed right. A 2019 National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) study found that native grasses planted beneath solar arrays improve soil structure, reduce erosion and even help cool panels, making them more efficient.

But these examples take place after construction has begun. Hebb urged developers to care for the soil long before the first panel arrives on site.

The very first thing developers should do, according to Hebb, is to consider the topsoil—the thin, dark layer usually 5 to 10 inches deep that lets plants grow and keeps the ground healthy.

Topsoil forms slowly, with just a few inches taking hundreds to thousands of years to accumulate as rocks break down and organic matter from plants and animals builds up. It holds most of the soil’s life and fertility, containing the microbes, nutrients and moisture that plants depend on. But construction work such as grading, scraping and heavy vehicle traffic can destroy it in days by compacting the ground and stripping away its living layer.

Too often, Hebb said, solar companies mix or scrape it away when “grading,” or leveling the ground to install rows of panels, leaving behind hard soil that can’t easily recover.

Hebb encouraged developers to map and save the topsoil before building begins, removing and storing it carefully so it can be spread back later. That way, once construction is done, the soil still has the nutrients and structure needed for grasses, flowers, or grazing pastures to take root in the decades that the solar farm stands and the many more once it’s decommissioned.

“I think one policy that I would recommend is that you have to save topsoil. Whether you save all the topsoil or you save a certain amount, I think topsoil needs to be saved because it is, in our lifetime, a non-renewable resource,” Hebb explained.

So far, only a few states require that kind of soil care. In places like New Jersey, construction projects must replace at least five inches of topsoil and loosen the ground underneath to prevent compaction once work is finished. In Virginia, new solar rules require developers to map and protect prime farmland and if more than 10 acres are disturbed, they must offset the loss through conservation or practices such as preserving and replacing topsoil, decompacting soil and maintaining vegetation.

At the federal level, the Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) released a fact sheet in 2024 encouraging developers to minimize soil disturbance, preserve topsoil and plant perennial or pollinator-friendly vegetation to stabilize the land.

For now, most solar companies follow these practices voluntarily, often driven by sustainability goals or local partnerships with farmers rather than by regulation.

For Amanda Pankau, a director at the conservation nonprofit Prairie Rivers Network in Chicago, the importance could not be emphasized enough. Pankau was a panelist at the conference on land stewardship—the idea that the energy transition can heal the land instead of just using it.

Pankau works with communities in Illinois, which is home to one of the most fertile soils in the world. According to data, less than 1 percent of Illinois prairie is left.

“My father was the state soil scientist of Illinois,” she said. “I grew up understanding the wealth of our soils. They developed here in central Illinois under 10,000 to 15,000 years of prairie vegetation.”

Those ancient prairies produced the dark, carbon-rich topsoil that sustains the state’s agriculture today. But that soil, Pankau explained, has been steadily depleted by decades of industrial farming.

“Over 60 percent of our land in Illinois is used for just three crops: corn, soybeans and wheat. And most of them are grown in a way that isn’t sustainable,” she said. Fertilizers and pesticides wash into rivers, while bare fields erode in windstorms that now recall the Dust Bowl.

“We have an opportunity with solar to improve upon the status quo,” said Pankau.

Solar arrives in a landscape shaped by a history of skepticism. Pankau explained that many rural residents she’s spoken with see the technology as a threat to farmland that “feeds the world.”

But she said that argument misses a crucial fact: much of Illinois’ corn goes to ethanol, not food. And the state imports about 95 percent of what its people eat.

“Solar is borrowing the land for a certain amount of time,” she said. “It can be returned to farming in the future.”

In Illinois, state law already requires Agricultural Impact Mitigation Agreements, which dictate how solar projects handle soil and drainage under oversight from the Illinois Department of Agriculture.

“We’re lucky to have that,” Pankau said. “But there’s still room for improvement.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Ohio-solar-project_Pollinator1-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 12:10:16.038384

The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) released its 2025 Winter Fuels Outlook, predicting that heating costs across the nation—including Oklahoma—will vary based on fuel type. The report shows that most natural gas users will see similar bills to last winter, while electric heating households may pay slightly more. In contrast, propane and heating oil users should experience modest savings.

EIA’s projection comes as Oklahoma utilities prepare for fluctuating seasonal demand. The agency says the retail price of heating fuel remains the biggest factor in determining total winter expenses.

Natural Gas Still Dominates in Oklahoma

Oklahoma relies heavily on natural gas to heat homes, with nearly two-thirds of residents depending on it during colder months. Because the state both produces and processes gas locally, Oklahomans often enjoy lower heating costs than the national average.

However, natural gas markets remain volatile. Slight changes in supply or weather could affect monthly utility bills. The EIA warns that a colder-than-normal winter could drive prices upward, while milder temperatures could keep rates steady or even lower.

Electric-heated homes may see higher bills due to rising generation costs tied to increased natural gas usage in power plants.

Weather Scenarios and Economic Impacts

EIA modeled both 10% colder and 10% warmer scenarios to gauge how weather affects heating budgets. Under colder conditions, all fuel costs rise. A warmer winter benefits propane and heating oil users most, while electricity costs remain high regardless.

For the environment, biogas systems help protect our air, water and soil.
And using digested material from biogas systems, plus additional technology, can reduce or eliminate runoff of nutrients into our waterways.
Not enough people know what biogas systems are, even though they already operate in all 50 states.
Amid skyrocketing energy demand, biogas offers a clean and efficient way to produce more power.","We can’t ignore the reality: America needs more power. An explosion in new AI data center construction, a reshoring and expansion of domestic manufacturing, plus the broader increase in electrification of homes and vehicles are all putting enormous pressure on our energy grid.

At the same time, we’re coming to terms with another stark reality: America is producing more waste than ever. Organic waste from farms, food systems, landfills and wastewater has reached historic new highs.

The Environmental Protection Agency reports that municipal solid waste levels have skyrocketed by more than 230 percent over the last five decades since 1960, with a significant portion being degradable organic material like food scraps.

These two categories of challenges — the need to produce energy and manage our waste — presents a powerful opportunity: We can transform this abundant waste into biogas and natural fertilizer to meet America’s energy and agricultural needs.

Biogas is a renewable energy source created through the breakdown of organic waste such as manure, food scraps, sewage and crop residues. This process yields methane-rich gas, used to make energy, and digestate, a nutrient-rich byproduct usable as fertilizer.

Capturing this methane, which will be produced anyway if the waste isn’t managed, is good for the earth’s atmosphere as well, since methane is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas. We should capture as much of it as we can. Better still if the captured gas can also offset fossil fuel use for energy.

The benefits of biogas are undeniable. Biogas facilities produce energy 24/7, 365 days a year and have a reliability rate of 95 percent. Compared with solar and wind power — with approximately 25 percent and 35 percent reliability rates, respectively, depending on location — biogas provides us with one of the best options we have for sourcing power that is both reliable and renewable.

Beyond its consistent energy output, biogas plays a critical role in preserving America’s rural communities. Biogas systems can generate new revenue streams for communities and reduce costs for farmers.

By producing biogas and utilizing the leftover digestate for applications like animal bedding and natural fertilizer, farmers can achieve significant savings. This natural fertilizer, derived from digestate, can replace expensive synthetic fertilizers and has been shown to increase plant growth by 5 to 30 percent, further improving farm productivity.

For the environment, biogas systems help protect our air, water and soil. Air is improved through the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants from fossil energy. We protect our soil by recycling nutrients back into the land instead of using fossil-derived, synthetic fertilizers. And using digested material from biogas systems, plus additional technology, can reduce or eliminate runoff of nutrients into our waterways.

Despite these benefits, biogas remains an underutilized energy source with only 10 to 15 percent of the potential systems built so far. Industry data shows that the U.S. has over 17,000 potential new biogas systems waiting to be built to reduce our waste. Fully developing this potential could power millions of homes and displace substantial amounts of fossil-fuel use, all which benefiting American farms and businesses.

A global perspective underscores this opportunity. The International Energy Agency suggests that biogas and biomethane could collectively meet 20 percent of global gas demand.

For the U.S., embracing biogas is not just an environmental imperative but also a strategic move to reduce our dependence on volatile fossil-fuel markets. Internationally, the European Union has already recognized biogas production as an effective strategy to reduce reliance on gas imports from unfriendly nations.

Even national public opinion firmly supports investment in biogas, once Americans know what a biogas system does. The data show strong bipartisan backing, with over 80 percent of Americans supporting federal investments in converting waste to energy. They view biogas as a practical, local and environmentally responsible solution.

The catch? Not enough people know what biogas systems are, even though they already operate in all 50 states. Biogas is a proven, scalable energy solution that offers numerous benefits in the process. It cuts emissions, reduces waste, strengthens rural economies and meets our rising energy demands.

Amid skyrocketing energy demand, biogas offers a clean and efficient way to produce more power. The energy we need is already in our backyard — we just need to take advantage of it.

Hyderabad: The BRS leadership on Saturday slammed the Congress administration for fostering an environment of intimidation and extortion, particularly targeting industrialists and investors, in stark contrast to the previous BRS regime’s investor-friendly policies. The latest salvo came from party working president KT Rama Rao, who on Saturday highlighted the divide in governance styles. In a social media post, he contrasted the BRS’s “red carpet” welcome extended to investors during the K Chandrashekhar Rao era with what he described as Congress’s aggressive tactics.

“This was KCR Govt in action with respect to industry captains. Now we all know how the Congress Govt is dealing with industrialists,” he wrote while posting a visual from BRS investor summits held in the past, where he, as the then Minister for Industries, was holding an umbrella for a leading industrialist. The post reads – “BRS: Welcomes investors with respect. Congress: Threatens investors with guns. The difference is clear.” Earlier on Friday, BRS leader T Harish Rao demanded a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into what he termed a “gun culture” infiltrating the Congress cabinet. Rao alleged that internal clashes among Ministers have escalated to threats involving firearms, with close aides to the Chief Minister allegedly using intimidation tactics to extract money from businesses.

“The CM is presiding over a cabinet where guns are drawn not just in personal feuds but against those who dare to invest in Telangana,” Rao said, pointing to reports of Ministers’ associates parading armed guards during meetings with company executives.

In May 2024, the Clean School Bus Program rebate competition announced $23.98 million to help 27 Michigan schools and districts buy 97 buses powered by electricity and three powered by propane.

Also in 2024, the Michigan Department of Education announced its first and second rounds of Clean Bus Energy Grant program funding: nearly $30 million in June to help 29 school districts and intermediate school districts buy a total of 114 buses powered by electricity, propane or natural gas; and $15.2 million in October to help 21 districts buy 40 electric buses and 17 propane buses.

Together, grants and rebates so far account for nearly 900 buses — some yet to be purchased or enter service. The funds generally cover a significant portion of the costs for vehicles and infrastructure, with the balance paid from local sources.

Cleaner buses offer many benefits

The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy has consistently supported clean power for Michigan’s nearly 17,000 buses transporting more than 800,000 students a year.

“The commitment by state and federal governments to provide schools with more environmentally friendly buses is good for our children, good for our schools and good for our communities,” EGLE Director Phil Roos said in the announcement. “Under Governor Whitmer's leadership, we are investing in clean-powered school buses, improving air quality and freeing up schools to invest in the classroom, and advancing the goals of the MI Healthy Climate Plan. These efforts are accelerating Michigan’s transition to a prosperous, healthy, equitable, clean energy future.”

Cleaner school buses offer many benefits, according to the EPA. With no or low emissions compared to diesel engines, they result in cleaner air on buses, in bus loading areas and in the communities where they operate. Diesel exhaust can lower air quality and impact the environment and human health, especially for children who have a faster breathing rate than adults and whose lungs are not yet fully developed.

The new grants are Round 3 of the Clean Bus Energy Grant program, which to date has awarded more than $81 million to Michigan schools for buses and associated infrastructure.

Applications for a final Clean Bus Energy Grant round of up to approximately $44 million are due Dec. 18.

Schools are working together

As part of the transition to clean buses, school districts across Michigan and nationwide are sharing solutions and working through challenges together. Groups such as the Michigan electric school bus coalition It’s Electric! advocate for school districts and support regular meetings with school transportation staff.

“We have enjoyed supporting school districts as they receive funds to transition their fleets from older, dirtier diesel buses to cleaner, quieter, newer models. This is a win for schools, kids, drivers, mechanics and the surrounding community,” Kindra Weid, It’s Electric! coalition coordinator, said in the announcement. “We know change comes with challenges, but these buses are worth the effort, and school districts across Michigan are experiencing lower maintenance costs, quieter rides and improved air quality as a result of their efforts pioneering new technology.”

Katrina Morris is executive director of the advocacy group Michigan Association of Pupil Transportation.

“Safety on the school bus is my top priority,” Morris said in the announcement. “I want all kids to have a safe ride to and from school, so cleaner air for the kids, drivers and the greater community is a victory. We are grateful for MDE and EGLE for supporting this transition to cleaner school buses.”

However, those waivers would not exempt projects from the state’s energy facility siting standards.","Renewable energy advocates hope a new directive from Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek will allow such projects to beat pending federal deadlines to receive government subsidies.

Kotek’s executive order authorizes nine natural resource agencies to adopt emergency rules and take other necessary actions to expedite solar and wind energy development.

It also contains a series of instructions specifically directed at the Energy Facility Siting Council to help accomplish that goal, including foregoing federal consultations if possible and contracting with third parties to process applications, and directs the Public Utility Commission to take steps that would shorten the timeline for connecting clean energy to the power grid, among other measures.

With how much is at stake for energy reliability and economic development, the order is likely to meaningfully hasten the permitting process, said Angela Crowley-Koch, executive director of the Oregon Solar and Storage Industries Association.

“I think the governor was pretty clear in her directive to agencies to do everything under their existing authority to straight-line processes and siting, and I think they’ll do that,” she said.

But Kotek’s executive order has also caught the attention of critics who are counting on the new federal deadlines to help them run out the clock and defeat certain projects.

Projects that would convert large amounts of farmland have proven particularly contentious, with neighbors often organizing to impede regulatory approvals.

While state agencies can shorten some aspects of the permitting process, the question is whether controversial proposals will be able to clear other time-consuming barriers before federal tax credits expire.

For example, the Muddy Creek Energy Park — a solar facility planned on 1,600 acres of farmland in Linn County — must still likely undergo studies on sensitive species and wetland impacts, said Troy Jones, a neighbor who opposes the project.

“That’s a big hurdle for them to get past,” Jones said. “I don’t believe, legally, they can get anything expedited in this particular project. I’d be very surprised if they were able to facilitate this project to be accelerated.”

To qualify for federal tax credits worth 30% of project expenses, construction on renewable energy facilities must begin by mid-2026 and finish by 2030. Those that can’t start by then must be completed by the end of 2027.

Those deadlines will arrive up to five years sooner than developers originally expected due to provisions included in the Trump administration’s “One Bill Beautiful Bill” earlier this year.

Without substantial subsidies, some projects may not be financially feasible unless they can surmount bureaucratic obstacles to begin building ahead of schedule.

“I don’t believe that it pencils out without our tax dollars going to offset those costs,” Jones said of the Muddy Creek Energy Park.

It’s also doubtful that Kotek’s directive will allow the project to bypass legally mandated regulatory requirements, he said. “I don’t believe the state will take those steps, even with the executive order in place.”

Connie Lee, an opponent of the Deschutes Solar and Battery Energy Storage System Facility in Wasco County, is likewise skeptical the executive order will allow the facility to qualify for tax credits, short of waiving key requirements.

“I think it’s going to be more difficult than they anticipated,” Lee said.

The 13,600-acre facility is planned mostly in an “exclusive farm use” zone, including irrigated property of higher agricultural value, and contains wildlife habitat in which disruptions must be mitigated, Lee said.

“I don’t see how it could speed up their process at all if they still have to follow all the same rules,” she said. “It just is a very complicated process. Unless they’re going to just say, ‘We’re not going to mitigate for habitat. We’re not going to make sure that all these studies are done and examined,’ I don’t see how they could speed it up much faster.”

And given the staggering cost of installing solar panels across more than 20 square miles, Lee said she has trouble understanding how the project could proceed without federal subsidies — particularly in light of expected delays in connecting it to transmission infrastructure.

“I don’t see how they could make money if they can’t tie into the grid and produce energy,” Lee said. “Without the tax credits, I don’t see how you could afford to do the project.”

Though the Oregon Solar and Storage Industries Association is optimistic the directive will streamline permitting procedures, it’s too early to discuss the specifics regarding siting, land use and other requirements, said Crowley-Koch.

“We’re excited to work with the agencies and the governor’s office and see what’s possible,” she said.

Due to the Trump administration’s aversion to consult on renewable energy projects, for instance, it may be possible to waive certain state rules that require federal involvement, she said.

“Unfortunately, those federal agency staff members are not picking up the phone anymore. They’re not answering emails,” Crowley-Koch said. “That’s become a real problem for projects that are trying to move along in the process.”

While renewable energy “has the potential to play a supporting role” in assuring access to affordable and reliable electricity, the Oregon Farm Bureau believes it must be developed “without compromising the viability of our agricultural lands,” said Ryan Krabill, the organization’s government affairs manager.

To that end, the Farm Bureau is concerned that Kotek’s executive order “could open the door to expedited permitting processes that have the potential to undermine long-established farmland protections,” he said.

The state government must ensure that any projects fast-tracked under the directive fully comply with the land use planning laws and avoid construction on productive farmland, Krabill said.

“Farmers must not be made to bear the unintended consequences of rushed decision-making,” he said.

But the farmland preservation group 1000 Friends of Oregon doesn’t consider it likely that Kotek’s executive order will undermine land use protections, said Jim Johnson, its working lands policy director.

“It doesn’t affect any of the approval criteria,” Johnson said. “There’s only so much that this can change, ultimately.”

The governor can’t unilaterally change the law, so any action that amounts to “super-siting” solar and other renewable energy projects on farmland would require legislative action, he said.

The directive is more likely to prompt regulators to move certain projects “up in the queue” for permitting, for example, or to conduct required wildlife analysis in a more timely manner, Johnson said.

“What it’s going to do is tell agencies to give these priority and to try to speed it up. It doesn’t change the law,” he said. “In fact, the legislature could only change the law.”

When asked for concrete examples of the directive’s practical effects, the governor’s office pointed to a provision in the executive order that calls for the state’s Energy Facility Siting Council to hold additional meetings to expedite permitting.

Under another provision, certain civil penalties could be waived for regulatory violations, as long as they’re limited to the “minimum disturbance necessary” for solar and wind projects to begin construction by the federal deadline.

However, those waivers would not exempt projects from the state’s energy facility siting standards.

The governor’s office is also compiling a list of eligible project that are likely to meet the executive order’s criteria, which should be finished later this month, said Anca Matica, its communications and policy advisor.

“The directive to agencies is that the highest priority should be given to projects that have secured power purchase interconnection agreements and can demonstrate the project will provide benefits to Oregon ratepayers,” she said.",https://capitalpress.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2025/10/36293687776_91922114ba_k.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 14:03:49.407857

""This transition can generate significant local health benefits by delivering cleaner and more efficient heat for industrial settings.
Educational efforts, policies, and investments in more efficient industrial technologies will yield major benefits for American communities and American manufacturers.""","A new study from the American Lung Association revealed the potential cost and health savings if U.S. manufacturers replaced thousands of industrial boilers with heat pumps.

According to the report, summarized by Canary Media, a gradual transition to heat pumps would save Americans $1.1 trillion in public health costs and avoid 77,200 pollution-inflicted deaths from 2030 to 2050. The publication explained that heat pumps use electricity to transfer heat instead of relying on dirty energy sources such as coal, oil, and natural gas, which contribute to the heating of the planet and health-harming air pollution.

States with higher concentrations of people living near industrial pollution sources stand to benefit the most, according to the analysis. Florida, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina were identified as the states with the biggest estimated health benefits, with $107 billion, $82 billion, and $68 billion in projected savings, respectively. Twenty-three other states would save at least $25 billion each.

But heat pumps aren't just a solution for industry. Homeowners can implement these systems in their homes, which can save them money on utility bills. Heating and cooling are responsible for 60% of household emissions, according to Rewiring America, which adds that heat pumps are two to three times more energy-efficient than most traditional heating systems that rely on dirty energy sources. For instance, Mitsubishi, one of several companies that offer home heat pump systems, states that its devices are between 160% and 390% more efficient than gas-powered furnaces.

One other benefit of switching to heat pumps — whether at the industrial or household level — is that it cuts planet-heating pollution. Plus, this equipment delivers both heating and cooling in one package, and some heat pump users say these devices even distribute the heat in a way that feels more comfortable.

""I noticed … how different the 'comfort' feels compared to a regular furnace,"" one Redditor wrote. ""It's not blasting hot air all at once, but more of a steady, even warmth. Took me a few days to get used to, but now I actually prefer it.""

While it may seem overwhelming to find the right system for you, Mitsubishi can connect you with trained professionals in its trusted network who will help you install an efficient heat pump system.

For The Verge’s exclusive tour of these secretive labs, I watch researchers peer at cell chemistries down to the atomistic level, using electron microscopes. Others work at a larger scale, all the way up to the Megashaker. Inside a cavernous hall, an enormous sliding test chamber envelops one of GM’s double-stacked, 205-kilowatt-hour battery packs — the type that powers hulking models like the Cadillac Escalade IQ.

The 2,900-pound pack is suspended in midair from a ceiling-mounted crane, bolted to a surrounding structure to mimic its connection to a moving vehicle. Like a lithium-soaked smoothie, the battery is hydraulically shaken in the atmospherically controlled chamber, simulating anything from potholes to low-speed collisions. With dozens of test chambers for individual cells, modules, or entire packs, GM can simulate 10 years and 250,000 miles of real-world battery use and abuse in about six months.

GM can simulate 10 years and 250,000 miles of real-world battery use and abuse in about six months

That real world has become especially abusive to EVs. Some consumers have grown ambivalent, in part due to stubbornly high prices. Pollution and fuel-economy rules face an anachronistic rollback, encouraging automakers to lean into fossil-fueled cars. In the latest indignity, the $7,500 federal clean-car credits, beloved by EV buyers and a wellspring of sales for GM and other automakers, have been choked off by the Trump administration. All that took a $1.6 billion toll on GM’s bottom line this week, in the form of a writedown on third-quarter earnings.

GM directly attributed that $1.6 billion loss to the Trump administration eliminating credits and loosening emissions rules. The dirty ripples from those moves will surely be more polluting internal combustion engine (ICE) cars on the roads, and fewer EVs, as GM and other automakers scale back production to match lowered expectations for consumer demand. For all their sleek new models and multibillion-dollar investments, GM and other automakers continue to lose money on the electric side of the business. And this was before all these new headwinds began to blow.

GM must somehow withstand these industry shake-ups and stresses. But even as it plays defense by shoring up its ICE business, GM plans to keep on the EV offensive. Inside its sprawling Technical Center, the classic midcentury campus designed by Eero Saarinen, GM brings a 21st-century weapon to light: lithium manganese rich batteries, or LMR.

Is LMR the real deal?

Some analysts and investors keep saying Detroit has little chance of competing with China on the global EV stage. GM executives and engineers beg to differ, even as the Trump administration kneecaps the top-down energy and manufacturing policies and government supports that China used to go from automotive also-ran to a dominant force in EVs and batteries.

GM says its affordable, more sustainable LMR batteries will decisively outperform China’s best lithium iron phosphate (LFP) specimens — currently the world’s favored low-cost solution. The company’s new cells should deliver one-third more driving range than LFP, at virtually identical cost. All things equal, that’s the difference between an EV that can cover 300 miles and one that can keep going for 100 miles more. Indeed, GM promises better than 400 miles of EPA-rated range from their largest SUVs and pickups when these batteries arrive in 2028. They’ll also save GM at least $6,000 per battery pack, versus today’s pricey high-nickel cells. That’s nearly enough, by itself, to offset the loss of those $7,500 credits and bring EVs closer toward elusive price parity with gasoline models.

GM plans to keep on the EV offensive

“This unlocks premium long-distance range at an affordable cost,” says Andy Oury, a lead GM battery engineer.

Kurt Kelty, who helped transform the global industry as Tesla’s battery cell development chief, says these cells — unlike solid-state chemistries — aren’t the usual battery clickbait, promising on the page yet perennially stuck in the lab. Talking with more than a dozen battery executives, engineers, researchers, and scientists, their confidence was palpable: These batteries, they say, are tested, proven, and ready for mass production. GM is spending $900 million to build a pair of sprawling new battery centers here, on top of more than $5 billion already invested in US battery operations.

Kelty, GM’s vice president of battery, propulsion, and sustainability, has spent a lifetime in the field. He was at Sony in 1991 when the company debuted its revolutionary Camcorder, the first video recorder with a lithium-ion battery. He spent 11 years guiding Tesla’s battery tech as roughly Employee No. 50 at Elon’s fledgling outfit, then worked on the anode side for Sila Nanotechnologies before coming to GM.

“I’ve kind of seen it all at this point,” Kelty tells me. “So when I say this a game-changer, well, I’ve seen a lot of technologies come and go. Or usually not come. They have an announcement, and then they disappear. That’s kind of the standard for the battery industry.”

Where batteries tend to be about incremental improvement — a superior coating here, a better copper foil there — Kelty says these prismatic LMR cells represent a serious step change. One without the usual tradeoffs.

“That’s why we’re excited about it,” he says. “You can typically get high energy but kill your life cycle, kill your cost, or whatever. But in this case, it’s a really balanced chemistry.”

These batteries could stage an end-run around China in another way, relying more on a US-based supply chain that’s just getting off the ground. Asked about China’s current dominance, Kelty says GM knows what it’s up against. In a bitter irony for American innovation and manufacturing, that Nobel-winning LFP tech was developed right here at the University of Texas. But as American companies dithered, China helped itself to the patented technology and built itself an LFP empire.

“They violated the IP for years and years, but they only sold within China, so it was never an issue,” Kelty says. “Now those patents have expired, so they don’t have any problems exporting [LFP].”

“So you’ve got to keep in mind who your competitors are. And by using LMR, we can now actually exceed their LFP performance, but give it a similar cost.”

A hot ticket in batteries

Oury says LMR has been around for a decade, but researchers couldn’t overcome issues with voltage that petered out over time. Accelerating its development five years ago, starting with coin-size cells, GM solved the durability issues and steadily worked its way up to a larger prismatic form factor — stacks of thin cells, roughly the size of a laptop case — that will go into vehicles.

“We got the confidence to scale up to larger designs,” Oury says.

Among North American automakers, GM placed early bets on building its own “high nickel” or “nickel rich” batteries. That NCM (for nickel-cobalt-manganese) chemistry is the most energy-dense and currently powers nearly every EV sold in America. The automaker initially struggled to build those pouch batteries at scale, bringing production of some EVs to a crawl. But now those bets are paying off, giving GM a potential edge against EV latecomers, including tariff-tossed import brands with no domestic EV or battery factories. GM is now producing more lithium-ion cells than any automaker in North America, in partnership with LG Energy Solution at plants in Ohio and Tennessee.

“So when I say this a game-changer, well, I’ve seen a lot of technologies come and go.”

Kelty says GM can produce those cells at lower cost than any domestic rival. Based in part on teardowns of roughly two dozen competitors’ packs here, Kelty says GM isn’t yet the lowest-cost producer at the pack level — but will reach that milestone with its next-generation EVs. For one, prismatic LMR packs will require 50 percent fewer parts.

High-nickel may be the long-distance champ, but it’s expensive, heavy on pricey nickel and cobalt. Cobalt is also ethically fraught, including sourcing from African mines where children perform hazardous work for meager wages. Those battery costs, roughly 30 percent of a typical vehicle’s cost, remain the number one factor in making EVs unaffordable for many Americans. It’s the reason Cadillac’s impressive Lyriq-V, the 615-horsepower SUV, starts at over $81,000. It’s why a Cadillac Escalade IQ costs $130,000, or a Chevy Silverado EV pickup starts at $75,000.

China’s answer was those LFP batteries, which sparked that nation’s EV revolution, especially for small budget models that dominate that market. Safe and durable, those batteries replaced cobalt and nickel with cheap, plentiful iron and phosphate. GM, Ford, and Stellantis are among Western automakers now looking to build their own LFPs. The tradeoff is mediocre driving range and performance. The newest “Blade” LFP battery from China’s BYD delivers roughly 350 watt-hours per liter of volume. That compares with more than 600 watt-hours for GM’s high-nickel batteries, or Tesla’s 4680 cylindrical cells.

LMR’s innovation finds a middle ground through a healthy dose of manganese, the abundant silver-gray transition metal. The cells sacrifice only modest range versus the most powerful high-nickel designs. But they could be vastly cheaper and whip LFP’s driving range or performance. Ford has announced its own breakthrough in LMR.

In this chemistry competition, the action here is mainly in the cathode. That’s the positive battery electrode that generates electricity for a car or smartphone, and accepts electrons in a chemical reaction as the battery discharges.

Today’s NCM batteries contain up to 85 percent nickel in those cathodes, 10 percent manganese, and 5 percent cobalt. LMR batteries flip that. Their cathodes contain up to 70 percent manganese, about 30 percent nickel, and 2 percent or less of cobalt.

“Manganese is dirt cheap, so at a raw materials level, it gives you that benefit to start with,” says Kushal Narayanaswamy, GM’s director of advanced battery cell engineering.

GM in the house

Cheaper materials are only a start. Analysts say some Chinese companies are bringing new cars or batteries to market in as little as two years. That unrivaled pace may be China’s biggest advantage, more than the technology onboard their EVs. GM says its in-house operations could cut the time it takes to bring new batteries to showrooms by a full year, at lower costs and with higher quality.

I meet Narayanaswamy at the Wallace Battery Cell Innovation Center, a linchpin of GM’s DIY approach to batteries. It’s taking a page from the vertical integration that characterizes China’s BYD, the world’s largest maker of EVs and batteries. Here, GM is developing and testing its own chemistries — mixing black slurries, coating cathodes — without constant back and forth with outside suppliers that can slow projects to a crawl. The Wallace lab can now produce up to 100 cells a day, and has created 26 variants of LMR cells in three form factors. Next door, I see the Ancker-Johnson Battery Cell Development Center under construction. The 500,000-square-foot facility will house a small pilot assembly line for batteries, bridging the often daunting gap between labs and factory production.

The automaker has cut testing time for new batteries by 60 percent. Digital twins and virtual modeling simulate hundreds of real-world scenarios — from condensation in battery packs to catastrophic collisions — before GM builds a single physical cell or pack. The company has simulated more than 1.4 million miles of driving. Radu Theyyunni, global director of virtual electrification and powertrain, says the company’s physics-based models have logged 150 million hours of compute time, to optimize LMR from the atomistic level to full packs. That’s the equivalent of a single, powerful CPU running nonstop for 171 years.

An obvious question: If LMR is all that, why is GM messing around with LFP batteries at all, with plans for production in Tennessee? GM executives argue that LFP can still be the right fit for lower-cost, lower-range models. And LFP shows great potential for second-life uses in stationary energy storage.

Forget the cavalry — it’s up to automakers and consumers

With government credits gone kaput, GM has chosen to pick up those $7,500 tabs itself for now through subsidized lease deals, to keep EV sales from flatlining. That’s generous of GM, but another hit to its bottom line, on top of a tariff bill that could reach $5 billion by year end. Dealers are surely being asked to share the pain.

I ask Kelty if the end of credits is like tearing off the Band-Aid: painful, but ultimately necessary. The credits were never meant to last forever. Now automakers have nowhere to hide, no subsidies, and no excuses. Analysts say the move may separate EV contenders from pretenders. Only automakers who can deliver affordable, compelling EVs, at a profit, will compete or perhaps survive, including against China on the global stage.

“Would I prefer that had come later?” Kelty says of the precipitous end of credits. “Yes, I think we all would. But it forces us to go in the right direction. We’ve got to get our costs down.

“We did this at Tesla as well, to ignore all the incentives out there. You’ve got to be able to stand on your own. And that’s the way we’re looking at it here at GM.”

Kelty says EVs can already match ICE cars in total cost of ownership. But that hasn’t won over enough Americans who look at an EV and see only a higher monthly payment.

“Within the last year, we have had roughly $70 billion of capital expenditures announced in Louisiana – that’s unheard of in a lot of states,” Davison said in a Thursday address at the Louisiana Energy Summit in New Orleans hosted by the American Council for Capital Formation.

‘Small Louisiana has always been able to punch above our weight and be able to deliver needs to the world and to the nation in ways that other states cannot, so I think it’s important that we think about the fact that we are going to be growing in ways that we never expected before. As we start to develop and grow a little bit more, we need to be focused on how we are going protect our resources and how we can be partners in protecting those resources,” said Davidson.

Davidson, appointed by Gov. Jeff Landry in September 2025, is overseeing a reorganization of the Department of Conservation and Energy aimed at reducing bureaucratic hurdles while also adapting to modern industrial technologies.

“We took the opportunity to eliminate some of the duplicative functions that we had in the department,” he said. “Now we have one permitting office – a permitting office that handles coastal use permits, oil and gas permits, carbon capture permits, and any other permits that we issue. The department now has an enforcement office, ready to enforce the laws on the books, and an Office of Energy that is being expanded to mirror the federal Office of Energy,” said Davidson.

Davidson said the Department of Conservation and Energy, formerly the Department of Energy and Natural Resources, has been “reactive” in the management of oil and gas and water resources for years, in part because of outdated statutes on the books since the early 1900s. Additionally, the department had not been restructured since 1976, Davidson noted.

“We’ve taken the steps as a Department of Conservation and Energy to work closely with Louisiana Economic Development to make sure that any new business they are recruiting to the state is communicated to us, and that we can identify those permits on the front end so that there’s no lag or no delay in delivering those projects to communities – projects like we see in Richland, Louisiana with Meta or like we see with other businesses that will be coming to the state,” said Davidson

“As we look forward to the development of new technologies – and permitting projects around the state – we want make sure that we’re working with the applicants to make sure they know that they need to get out and partner with the community,” Davidson said.

Davidson said the oil and gas industry would benefit from a lower severance tax. “We’ve taken that approach to make sure that we can bring in new developers and help out some of the existing developers that are looking for new plays throughout the state,” he said.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/31/531168ba-b335-453b-ab9f-ef8dab017a9f/68dd7abb9528f.image.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 12:11:49.451128

About 30 miles off the coast of Virginia Beach, Virginia, workers have been building America’s largest offshore wind farm at a breakneck pace. The project will start feeding power to the grid by March — the most definitive start date provided by its developer yet.

“First power will occur in Q1 of next year,” Dominion Energy spokesperson Jeremy Slayton told Canary Media. ​“And we are still on schedule to complete by late 2026.”

In an August earnings call, Dominion Energy CEO Robert Blue provided a vague window of ​“early 2026” when asked when the 2.6-gigawatt Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, or CVOW, project would start generating renewable power for the energy-hungry state.

As of the end of September, Dominion had installed all 176 turbine foundations — ​“a big, important milestone,” per Slayton. That accomplishment involved pile-driving 98 foundations into the soft seabed during the five-month stretch when such work is permitted. Good weather helped the work move along quickly, as did the Atlantic Ocean’s unusually quiet hurricane season.

Speed is key when building wind projects under the eye of a president who has called turbines ​​“ugly” and ​​“terrible for tourism” — and who has followed up with attempts to dismantle the industry.

Had CVOW not finished foundation installation by the end of this month, turbine construction would have been delayed until next spring. Federal permitting restricts pile-driving to a May-through-October window to protect migrating North Atlantic right whales. Such a delay would have made CVOW more vulnerable to the wrath of the Trump administration, which has already issued stop-work orders to two offshore wind farms under construction.

But Slayton said the threat of President Donald Trump’s interference doesn’t concern him. CVOW is, after all, 1 of only 2 in-progress offshore wind projects that hasn’t been directly attacked by the president.

“Our project has enjoyed bipartisan support from the beginning,” he said, pointing to backing from some of the state’s leading Republicans, including Governor Glenn Youngkin and U.S. Representative Jen Kiggans.

Kiggans, who represents the politically moderate Virginia Beach area, brought her concerns about Trump’s escalating war on wind to the House floor last month, when Congress returned from recess. She called CVOW ​“important to Virginia,” and House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, later told reporters that he relayed Kiggans’ message directly to Trump.

“I understand the priority for Virginians and we want to do right by them, so we’ll see,” Johnson told Politico​’s E&E News, in a comment that broke from an anti–offshore wind narrative that’s taken root among many of his fellow House Republicans.

The project is crucial for helping the state meet a deluge of new electricity demand, as Virginia is at the center of the nationwide boom in data-center construction. CVOW will provide a huge amount of carbon-free power to the state and Dominion, its largest utility — helping both keep pace with rising demand without having to burn more polluting fossil fuels.

Kiggans also tied the success of CVOW to the needs of Virginia’s military installations.

“I always speak about that project in light of the national security benefit and that benefit to Naval Air Station Oceana,” Kiggans said last month in an interview with WAVY, a Virginia news station, noting that a partnership with Dominion is ​“giving Naval Air Station Oceana a $500 million power grid upgrade.”

Dominion has already spent $6 billion on the monumental effort to build CVOW, which has been 12 years in the making. Almost $1 billion of that investment has flowed to the local economy, creating 802 full- and part-time jobs in the state’s Hampton Roads region, according to G.T. Hollett, Dominion Energy’s director of offshore wind.

CVOW’s benefits are being felt nationwide too.

“The project has already created 2,000 direct and indirect American jobs and generated $2 billion in economic activity, strengthening the nation’s manufacturing supply chains and our regional economy,” said Katharine Kollins, president of Southeastern Wind Coalition.

Now Dominion will turn to the final phase of construction: turbine installation. The work is made possible by Charybdis — the first U.S.-built, Jones Act–compliant wind-turbine installation vessel — which arrived in Virginia’s Portsmouth Marine Terminal last month.",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/dominionenergy.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-10-18 12:11:54.365170

China, the world's largest auto market, accounted for roughly two-thirds of global sales, or about 1.3 million vehicles. North America and Europe also posted record highs, according to Rho Motion data manager Charles Lester.

""China remains the dominant driver of global EV growth,"" Lester said, noting that September is typically the country's busiest month for car buying. This year, demand was boosted further by shoppers trying to use up regional trade-in subsidies before they expired.

In the United States, sales jumped as buyers rushed to take advantage of the US$7,500 federal EV tax credit before it ended in late September. Rho Motion said U.S. demand is expected to drop sharply in the final quarter of the year as both consumers and businesses lose access to those incentives, which have been central to recent growth.

Europe also set a new record, thanks to incentives in Germany and solid demand in the United Kingdom. Tesla's rollout of a lower-cost Model Y in Europe is expected to intensify competition in the coming months.

During an interview for the Plugged-In Podcast, airing Friday, I asked GM President Mark Reuss about the ""family of Bolts"" he mentioned on stage at an investor event about a year ago. What can we expect those to be like?

“What comes after this, whether it’s called a Bolt or not, will be a family of things that is low priced,” he said. “And when I say family, they won’t be adopted. They’ll be in the same vein of size and price.”

So, the family members won't all be Bolts, but they will share its general price point and size. That is, they'll be compact electric vehicles that cost around $30,000. The launch-edition Bolt goes on sale for $29,990 early next year, and Reuss said the upcoming models would be ""around that price point, so plus or minus.""

The big question, then, is what kinds of EVs to expect. Understandably, GM is playing it close to the chest, as none of these vehicles have been officially announced. But Reuss did say broadly that they could slot into ""white spaces"" in the EV market.

“I also think there’s some white spaces in size, class, of forms—not only the Bolt that we just introduced but also some different things, for different people’s styled tastes,"" he said.

There's one glaring ""white space"" to me, and that's the compact electric pickup segment. Ford has seen great success with the Maverick, but there's no electric equivalent to that yet. Ford is working on a roughly $30,000 electric pickup, and Slate is getting ready to launch one in the mid-$20,000 ballpark.

It wouldn't be at all surprising if GM was considering the same thing, especially because hulking, expensive, big-battery trucks like the Silverado EV haven't exactly taken off in the marketplace. Plus, we know the automaker has at least toyed with the idea in its affordable EV design studio.

Otherwise, I'd bank on another Bolt-sized compact crossover. Chevy said the 2027 Bolt will be ""limited run,"" and GM will likely want another small SUV to fill in its place in the EV lineup below the roughly $36,000 Equinox EV. A small sedan or hatchback seems unlikely, since GM has largely exited that segment.

Earlier this year, GM said a mysterious ""next-gen affordable EV"" will be built at its Fairfax Assembly Plant in Kansas City, where the Bolt is produced.

The new Bolt is a partially redesigned take on the latest version, packing a new 65 kWh lithium-iron-phosphate battery pack, better charging and a new motor into the same general package. Reuss suggested that the cheaper ""family"" will use different underlying technology from GM EVs that came before. That could mean a wider adoption of LFP batteries, or something different like the lithium-manganese-rich (LMR) cells it's working on to cut costs.

Ford, for its part, has developed a ground-up platform and manufacturing system designed to make its next-generation EVs cheaper to build. GM is trying to drive down production costs, too.

“I think it’s another opportunity for us to look at battery chemistry and form, and a different architecture underneath that can be even more efficient, and give people even more car for the money,"" Reuss said.

This deployment uses the natural gas network run by Energy Transfer to ensure a steady, reliable supply for Oracle’s expanding cloud infrastructure.

Nathan Ough, Chief Executive Officer of VoltaGrid, calls it more than a standard power agreement.

He says: “This is more than a power deal, it’s a collaboration with Oracle to engineer scalable solutions that dampen swings in AI power demand.”

Nathan adds that their platform offers ""grid-grade performance with ultra-fast response, zero reliance on battery storage and near-zero criteria air emissions"".

The infrastructure rests on VoltaGrid’s modular power system, developed in collaboration with industrial technology firms INNIO Jenbacher and ABB.

The system meets the highly variable power requirements of AI workloads while reducing the need for battery-based backup.

The design enables fast response to changing loads, aligning reliability with environmental standards.

Matching AI's power volatility with scalable solutions

AI data centres face uneven energy demand.

As AI models grow in size and complexity, the power load shifts depending on the computational tasks at hand.

These fluctuations present a challenge for infrastructure providers, who must deliver constant power despite the inconsistent nature of the workloads.

Mahesh Thiagarajan, Executive Vice President of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, explains: “AI workloads are uniquely power-intensive and highly variable, often creating swings in demand.”

He says the collaboration with VoltaGrid helps Oracle to create “innovations that dampen these swings, making AI’s power usage more stable, predictable and grid-friendly”.

Oracle aims to support its AI infrastructure with dependable power that scales up or down without delay.

VoltaGrid’s platform becomes part of OCI’s wider energy strategy, offering on-demand delivery that aligns with both performance goals and emissions compliance.

The system also reduces strain on local grids, freeing Oracle from full reliance on public infrastructure.

The modular design provides high-quality output with fast deployment and supports improved heat rejection, a critical factor in high-density computing environments.

Natural gas backbone and firm power delivery

The infrastructure receives fuel from Energy Transfer, a key US energy supplier with an extensive pipeline and storage network.

This access to firm natural gas supply allows VoltaGrid to maintain operational consistency, a necessity for enterprise-scale data centres dealing with complex AI workloads.

VoltaGrid’s use of hybrid power, balancing gas efficiency with environmental goals, fits into Oracle’s strategy of resilience through energy diversification.

The system avoids the volatility of pure renewables while keeping emissions low.

This approach reflects wider trends in data centre energy strategy.

As power needs rise, especially with growth in high-performance computing and AI, cloud providers look for energy models that guarantee uptime.

VoltaGrid’s offering supports those aims without pulling heavily from local grids.

The partnership sets up Oracle to maintain availability and performance across regions that face surging demand for electricity.

Earlier this year, amid much fanfare, the world’s largest maritime nations agreed on the regulations, which would impose a fee on carbon pollution to clean up shipping. The next step of the process — adopting the regulations — during the International Maritime Organization meeting in London this week was widely expected to be a formality.

Instead, after much pressure from Trump, along with Saudi Arabia and a handful of other countries, delegates decided to postpone the decision by a year and adjourn. In the interim, nations will continue to negotiate and work toward consensus.

The development underscored how the influence of Trump, who recently called climate change a “con job,” extends globally to policies aimed at combating climate change.

“Faced with pressure, too many governments chose political compromise over climate justice, and in doing so, abandoned the countries bearing the brunt of the climate crisis,” said Emma Fenton, senior director for climate diplomacy at a U.K.-based climate change nonprofit, Opportunity Green.

The Trump administration was quick to celebrate

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio hailed the development as “another huge win” for Trump.

“Thanks to his leadership, the United States prevented a massive U.N. tax hike on American consumers that would have funded progressive climate pet projects,” Rubio wrote on X. “Our country will continue to lead the way and put America FIRST.”

Trump had urged countries to vote “No,” posting on his social media platform Truth Social on Thursday that “the United States will not stand for this global green new scam tax on shipping.” The U.S. had threatened to retaliate with tariffs, visa restrictions and port levies if nations supported it.

After vowing to fight any global tax on shipping emissions, Saudi Arabia called for a vote to adjourn the meeting for a year. More than half the countries agreed.

Arsenio Dominguez, secretary-general of the IMO, the United Nations agency that regulates international shipping, said in a post-meeting news conference that “geopolitics in the world right now makes it more difficult for us to make progress in certain topics.”

Nations falter in their efforts to save the planet

The decision, or lack thereof, in London is similar to what happened this summer with a major treaty to end growing plastic pollution around the world. The negotiations fell apart, with the United States and Saudi Arabia opposing any limit on plastic production.

The world’s biggest climate summit, COP30, is in November in Belem, Brazil. Ralph Regenvanu, minister for climate change for the Pacific Island nation of Vanuatu, said the road to Belem and beyond is now more difficult.

“The IMO’s failure to adopt the framework this week marks a failure of this United Nations agency to act decisively on climate change,” Regenvanu said. “But we know that we have international law on our side and will continue to fight for our people and the planet.”

Shipping emissions grow

Large ships last about 25 years, so the industry would need to make changes and investments now to slash its emissions. Most ships today run on heavy fuel oil that releases carbon dioxide and other pollutants as it’s burned. The International Chamber of Shipping, which represents over 80% of the world’s merchant fleet, advocated for the adoption of the regulations.

Thomas Kazakos, the chamber’s secretary-general, said they are disappointed because the industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonize the maritime sector.

Shipping emissions have grown over the past decade to about 3% of the global total as trade has grown and vessels use immense amounts of fossil fuels to transport cargo over long distances.

The regulations, or “Net-Zero Framework,” would set a marine fuel standard that decreases, over time, the amount of greenhouse gas emissions allowed from using shipping fuels. The regulations also would establish a pricing system that would impose fees for every ton of greenhouse gases emitted by ships above allowable limits, in what is effectively the first global tax on greenhouse gas emissions.

“The delay leaves the shipping sector drifting in uncertainty. But this week has also shown that there is a clear desire to clean up the shipping industry, even in the face of U.S. bullying,” said Alison Shaw, IMO Manager at Transport & Environment, a Brussels-based environmental nongovernmental organization.

The IMO set a target for the sector to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by about 2050, and has committed to ensuring that fuels with zero or near-zero emissions are used more widely.

“What matters now is that countries rise up and come back to the IMO with a louder and more confident yes vote that cannot be silenced,” said Anaïs Rios, shipping policy officer for Seas At Risk. “The planet and the future of shipping does not have time to waste.”",https://www.wishtv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/18/US-blocks-a-global-fee-on-shipping-emissions-as-international-meeting-ends-without-new-regulations-scaled-e1760746838654.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 15:02:35.813440

(DTN) -- U.S. soybean farmers could lose between $3.2 billion and $7.5 billion if the Trump administration does not completely reallocate biofuels gallons to small-refinery exemptions to the Renewable Fuel Standard, a biofuels group told Lee Zeldin, administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, in an Oct. 16, 2025, letter.

Clean Fuels Alliance America cited an analysis by World Agricultural Economic and Environmental Services, that outlines the losses to soybean farmers based on how much volume from SREs is reallocated.

The EPA issued a supplemental proposal to the RFS volumes, asking for public input on a range of reallocation from zero to 100%.

According to the company's study, if the agency adopts a 50% reallocation in 2026 to 2027 490 million gallons of biomass-based diesel production would be lost, leading to $1.4 billion in lost soybean farm revenue and a $1.8 billion drop in the value of soybean products to soybean crushers.

Clean Fuels said in the letter to Zeldin that reallocating zero gallons of biofuels would be ""considerable worse.""

The analysis found it would lead to 1 billion gallons of lost biomass-based diesel production, $2.6 billion in lost soybean revenue to farms and a $4.9 billion drop in the value of soybean products to crushers.

""Biomass-based diesel is essential to America's farm security, now more than ever,"" Clean Fuels said in the letter.

""Domestic biodiesel, renewable diesel and SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) production supports 10% of the value of every bushel of soybeans grown in the United States. With increased farm productivity, U.S. soybean growers are right now harvesting a projected 4.3 billion bushels of soybeans for the season worth $43 billion. And with more than $6 billion of investment, U.S. soybean processors are expected to crush a record 2.5 billion of those bushels next year.""

Clean Fuels said that in facing retaliatory trade measures from China and a growing global competition from Argentina and Brazil, ""America's farmers cannot afford to lose the value"" that U.S. biomass-based diesel brings.

""We acknowledge that the current government shutdown is impacting both the administration's ability to provide economic relief to America's farmers and EPA's goal of meeting the statutory deadlines for the RFS rule,"" the group told Zeldin.

""Nevertheless, America's farmers are facing extreme economic challenge

and making planting decisions for next season. Biomass-based diesel producers and soybean processors are already negotiating feedstock contracts, fuel production and offtake agreements, and investment decisions for 2026. Across the board, our industry needs the rulemaking to be published before the end of the year to provide necessary policy stability and market confidence.""

Kurt Kovarik, Clean Fuels' vice president of federal affairs, said in a statement, ""Clean Fuels urges EPA to quickly finalize the robust, timely RFS volumes it proposed in June and ensure they are not eroded by small-refinery exemptions. U.S. biodiesel and renewable diesel production supports 10% of the value of every bushel of soybeans grown here. Supporting continued growth of U.S. biomass-based diesel is crucial right now to support American farmers and the agricultural economy.""

“You don’t have to love climate policy to love cheaper energy and American jobs.
For communities pursuing ambitious climate goals, the lesson is clear: engage people where they are, identify shared priorities, and focus on solutions that deliver economic and lifestyle benefits.","Heather Reams, the president of Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions (CRES), stepped onto the stage at Breckenridge’s Mountain Towns 2030 summit — a room full of progressives accustomed to negotiating with Republicans on climate policy. She faced an audience from Idaho, Wyoming, Utah and Colorado — areas that often depend on Republican-controlled legislatures to achieve local sustainability goals.

Reams suggested that the instinct of these communities shouldn’t be to lecture or shame. It should be to listen and find common ground. “Democrats can’t do it alone,” she said. “Republicans care deeply about their land. They hunt, they fish, they ski. They love the outdoors as much as anyone. So, of course, they care about clean air and water. The question is: How do we talk about it?”

A lifelong Republican, Reams has made it her mission to answer that question. CRES collaborates with GOP lawmakers to promote clean energy, arguing that the conservative case for renewables is grounded in innovation, competitiveness and energy independence — not ideology.

At the conference, she stressed that the key to climate progress isn’t confrontation, but compromise. One side might favor solar projects while the other insists on traditional fuel sources. By recognizing shared interests — for example, expanding solar energy while permitting additional natural gas pipelines or transmission lines — both sides can advance without ideological conflict. It’s not about surrender; it’s practical problem-solving.

Reams highlighted Sen. John Curtis of Utah, founder of the Conservative Climate Caucus, as a conservative champion of the environment. He has argued that the GOP should help shape, not resist, climate policy, emphasizing that sound stewardship and strong markets go hand in hand. Not all conservatives are on board. Reams wryly notes Utah’s other senator, Mike Lee, who, as she puts it, “just pats me on the head” when renewables come up.

Polls suggest that finding common ground reflects more than strategy— it meets voter demand. Pew Research Center data from 2024 show that 72 percent of Americans — including 56% of Republicans under 40 — support expanding solar and wind energy. A Yale Climate Communications poll reinforces this enthusiasm, showing that clean energy incentives can generate local jobs and economic growth.

Beyond politics, Reams emphasized the economic benefits of renewables. Solar, wind, battery storage, advanced nuclear, and geothermal are increasingly cost-competitive. Emerging energy industries can create high-paying local jobs, keeping residents in their hometowns rather than forcing talent to cities. She believes free-market forces are increasingly backing the case for clean energy.

That resonates with Republican leaders, who tend to prioritize economic and local issues and often find that sustained dialogue is more effective than public confrontation. “Renewables are winning on price,” Reams said. “You don’t have to love climate policy to love cheaper energy and American jobs. We can win this on free-market principles.”

Geography and lifestyle naturally align. Western Republicans often share goals with progressives for preserving air, water and open space — and honoring the outdoorsy lifestyle. Coastal communities have similar motivations, whether it’s a clean Chesapeake Bay or a healthy Tampa Bay. For Americans who hunt, ski or hike, the outdoors can be a shared starting point — even across party lines.

For communities pursuing ambitious climate goals, the lesson is clear: engage people where they are, identify shared priorities, and focus on solutions that deliver economic and lifestyle benefits. Extreme views will always exist, but the broad middle can drive policy forward. Pragmatic collaboration, not ideological purity, is the path to progress.

By turning shared values into practical policies — whether through permitting reform or renewable energy initiatives — communities can make net-zero goals achievable. The enemy isn’t political disagreement; it’s obstinacy. When both sides operate from common interests, compromise becomes not just possible but also the most effective way forward.

As the push for renewable energy grows stronger, the state faces tough questions about how to transition away from its reliance on coal – an energy source deeply embedded in both the economy and culture. WFHB Environmental Correspondent Amelia Bucher explores the challenges, the stakes and the politics of Indiana’s energy future in her feature on the path to cleaner, more sustainable power.

And now for your environmental reports:

Indiana is doing its part to bring forests back to life:

The Nature Conservancy has been restoring Green’s Bluff, a natural area in Owen County threatened by development, and just this month, they secured an additional 83 acres. This means forest protection for the Raccoon Creek area of the forest and more habitats preserved for migrating songbirds. Many plants and animals need large, connected forests to survive. Once a fragmented woodlands, more than 68,000 trees now grow at Greens Bluff, including hardwood species like red oak, white oak, and walnut trees. Beyond planting, the Nature Conservancy has also added trails and created pollinator habitat at the preserve, and continues to pursue additional acreage to further consolidate forest protection at the site. Located about 15 minutes outside Bloomington, visitors can enjoy a trip to Greens Bluff Nature Preserve for a hike, to go birding, or to simply enjoy the changing colors of fall.

Coral reef decline: Scientists say coral reefs have become the first major environmental system on Earth to pass a climate tipping point—a threshold where damage to the planet becomes self-perpetuating and potentially irreversible. This report from the University of Exeter’s Global Systems Institute reveals that coral reefs have crossed the boundary where warming causes widespread, cascading collapse.

Warming oceans trigger bleaching events, where heat stress causes coral to expel the colorful algae that sustains it. If the stress continues, the coral dies completely. The International Coral Reef Initiative reported in April that an estimated 84 percent of the world’s coral reefs were under heat stress—the most extensive and intense mass bleaching event ever recorded. Coral reefs support about a quarter of all marine life and provide livelihoods for roughly a billion people worldwide.

Current global temperatures, about 1.4 degrees Celsius above preindustrial averages, are now just a fractions of a degree away from the worst-case scenario in which the coral simply cannot survive. However, there is still opportunity to slow these trends. Experts emphasize that slowing global warming by rapidly transitioning away from fossil fuels and shifting towards renewable energy is now essential to preserve remaining coral populations and prevent additional ecosystem collapses.

Here is more information on coral reefs. The planet just crossed its first climate tipping point. Coral reefs are now in irreversible decline due to ocean warming and acidification caused by climate change.

Without rapid climate action, experts warn that we’re on the brink of hitting other tipping points too, including the devastation of the Amazon rainforest, the collapse of vital ocean currents, and the loss of ice sheets.

The unfortunate fact is, world leaders are failing to act fast enough to avoid climate catastrophe. And some, including Donald Trump, are more focused on attacking climate science and ripping up all our climate progress to date.

That’s why COP30 — the world’s biggest climate talks — is an opportunity we can’t afford to miss. In less than a month, decision-makers will meet in Belém, Brazil, to shape the course of climate action for years to come. 350.org and our partners are demanding COP30 deliver:

A rapid phaseout of fossil fuels, with no new oil, gas, or coal projects.

Reparations from wealthy countries to communities on the frontlines of climate loss and damage.

Indigenous, traditional, and frontline leadership at COP.

This year’s COP couldn’t be held in a more significant place. Belém is known as the gateway to the Amazon — and climate change and deforestation are pushing the Amazon ecosystem to the point of no return.

Now that we’ve passed the first tipping point — the collapse of coral reefs — we’re hurtling toward the next: the dieback of the Amazon, which is a critical carbon sink and will do devastating harm to the 100 million people who depend on the forest. We can’t let that happen.

In a remarkable triumph for marine conservation, green sea turtles have been removed from the endangered species list!

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) announced the reclassification to “least concern” status last week, marking one of the most significant marine species recoveries in recent decades.

Green sea turtles had been hunted to near-extinction for their meat, eggs, and shells. But in the 1970s, the U.S. Endangered Species Act and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species banned commercial harvest and international trade of these animals. While these policies have vastly improved the population decline, sea turtles remain threatened by human presence: Accidents and injuries by boats and fishing and illness due to ocean pollution, especially plastics. But action has been taken to protect and restore green turtle populations. Around the world, individuals and organizations have driven local beach protection efforts, international collaboration between countries, and fishery innovations like turtle-friendly nets.

Florida has led much of the protection efforts in the U.S. through organizations like the Sea Turtle Conservancy which works to protect and improve sea turtle nesting grounds, and the Turtle Hospital which specializes rescue, rehabilitation, and release of sea turtles. Efforts like these along coasts worldwide have brought the green turtle population back to a level that no longer presents as “endangered.” The green turtle’s comeback offers proof that international cooperation and persistent effort can reverse biodiversity loss and restore hope for other endangered species.

Our friends at Wild Birds Unlimited share with us on how to prevent window strikes and help save the song birds.

Here’s a harsh truth: colliding with windows can be fatal for birds. Even if they manage to fly away, they are not just “stunned,” birds are often seriously injured. Windows reflecting sky or greenery trick birds into thinking there’s a clear flight path, and juvenile birds (who are just figuring things out) are especially at risk.

Preventing window strikes is one way you can help Save the Song Birds. With a few thoughtful adjustments, you can help birds recognize your windows as barriers, not passageways.

Feeder Placement: Place bird feeding stations within three feet of the window or beyond ten feet. Within three feet, birds fleeing the feeder area will not have built up enough speed to injure themselves if they strike the window. Beyond ten feet, birds will have enough time to spot and avoid the window.

Visual Cues: Apply deterrents to your windows (such as screens or decals) to help birds see the barrier and give them a chance to take action before any harm is done.

Install a Window Feeder: Use a window feeder to make birds more aware of the glass and so you have a front-row seat to watch your feathered visitors.

One year after removing the last dam on the Klamath River in California and Oregon, ecosystems are improving!

You may recall one of our September EcoReports cited the Klamath River dam removal as one example of Indigenous communities guiding environmental practices. Well since the removal of the dam last year, scientists can now confirm that these waters and their fish populations, are returning to original numbers, exceeding expectations.

For over a century, dams on the Klamath River created reservoirs that acted as “heat batteries,” allowing water to absorb and retain excessive summer warmth, triggering harmful algal blooms that produce the toxin microcystin. Since removing the last dam from the Klamath River, water samples that previously showed 58% contamination with microcystin now show zero detectable levels in 82% of samples.

According to the Yurok Tribal Fisheries Department Director Barry McCovey Jr., “the progress that we’ve made in just one year is pretty incredible. It provides us with a lot of hope for the future.”

Local tribal fishermen report that fish are returning earlier and in larger, healthier sizes than they have in over a century. The progress demonstrates the power of removing barriers to ecological recovery and offers hope for restoring other damaged river systems.

The accelerating energy demand is a growing concern for Americans.
There is no denying that renewable energy is supporting our economy and local workforce.
As the founder of Ideal Energy, a veteran-owned and operated solar and storage company, I am also proud that the renewable energy industry hires veterans at a faster rate than other industries.
As energy demands continue to rise and the country seeks long-term solutions, Iowa can be the example.","Iowa, a place over three million Americans call home, is also home to some of the nation's first achievements. We're the first in the country to caucus for president, the first to lead the nation in corn production, and the first to generate more than 60% of our electricity from renewable energy.

When it comes to setting an example, Iowa leads the way, and now is our moment to do it again.

The accelerating energy demand is a growing concern for Americans. With Iowa's electricity needs expected to increase by 30-60 percent over the next 20 years, it's time for Iowa to set an example for how we will stay ahead of the demand.

There is no denying that renewable energy is supporting our economy and local workforce. In Iowa alone, the industry employs nearly 15,000 workers, keeping them in their communities.

By being home to the first college in the nation to offer a Wind Energy and Turbine Technology associate's degree – utilizing a turbine as a working laboratory – young Iowans can effectively transition from the classroom into well-paying jobs in a place they already call home.

As the founder of Ideal Energy, a veteran-owned and operated solar and storage company, I am also proud that the renewable energy industry hires veterans at a faster rate than other industries.

With 16-plus years of experience serving our communities in clean energy, and 12 years of service to our country overseas as both a U.S. Navy SEAL and independent contractor under the Department of State, I recognize that renewable energy is the cleanest and most efficient form of homegrown energy, which keeps us from relying on foreign adversaries for our energy needs.

It is our mission to educate Iowans about localized energy solutions that allow us to flourish independently and empower our communities.

Iowa farmers should feel emboldened to harvest the sun and participate in cashing in on Iowa's most valuable land uses. According to the USDA NASS Data, the production value of solar is estimated at $11,068 per acre. That's ten times more than any other viable crop in the state. This income could be a lifeline for Iowa's generational farmers.

It is also important to note that these utility-scale solar and wind leases are completely voluntary between the landowner and the developer and will never require the use of eminent domain. Just another reason why protecting property rights also means protecting a farmer's right to choose what they harvest on their land.

Iowa is a state that leads, not follows. As energy demands continue to rise and the country seeks long-term solutions, Iowa can be the example.

We are not only powering our own communities with renewable energy, but we are empowering an entire nation to follow our lead as we light the way to an independent and secure energy future.

Illinois manufacturers are ready to help build a brighter energy future.
Mark Denzler is the president & CEO of the Illinois Manufacturers’ Association.","Illinois manufacturers are the backbone of our state’s economy—employing more than 600,000 workers, supporting local communities, and producing the goods that power America. But none of that is possible without access to affordable, reliable, and resilient energy.

Over the last several weeks, the Illinois House and Senate have held additional hearings to address the state’s rising power demands, with the goal of advancing legislation during the fall veto session in October. Unfortunately, this renewed push for a sweeping energy bill does little to address flaws in a similar proposal unveiled during the spring, with major new costs that could soon hit the manufacturing sector and every Illinois family. While it’s true that Illinois must modernize its energy framework, this latest proposal misses the mark by prioritizing costly mandates over meaningful investment in the resources we truly need: increased generation and more robust transmission.

The manufacturing sector is one of the largest consumers of energy in Illinois. Without affordable and predictable rates, manufacturers cannot plan for growth, make long-term investments, or stay competitive in a global economy. The current proposal jeopardizes that stability.

While provisions such as investing in battery storage are useful, the current proposal is a multi-billion dollar plan that will add a brand-new cost on every single energy bill. The proposal falls short of sufficiently addressing the need for more power generation, particularly dispatchable baseload generation that keeps the lights on when the sun isn’t shining and the wind isn’t blowing. Illinois manufacturers rely on uninterrupted power to operate safely and efficiently. Yet we’re seeing growing concerns about grid reliability throughout Illinois following repeated warnings issued by the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) about potential capacity shortfalls.

The impact of these warnings is not theoretical, with customers in downstate Illinois now feeling the strain of an estimated 20 percent increase in their electric bills. Looking north, the story is all too similar. Households in the service territory belonging to PJM, which serves Chicago and much of Northern Illinois, have already seen a $67.28 month-over-month increase to the average June 30 bill. What’s more, the capacity cost for electricity throughout PJM’s territory will climb another 22 percent beginning in June 2026 in accordance with the grid operator’s latest auction. These shortfalls and resulting price increases represent real risks to industrial operations, community investment, and economic development. Without a serious effort to both extend our current energy plants and increase generation capacity, we’re courting disaster.

Likewise, Illinois must invest in transmission infrastructure to deliver energy where and when it’s needed. Manufacturing isn’t confined to urban centers—it’s spread across the state, in both large cities and small towns. Without adequate transmission, adding new renewable or storage assets won’t help manufacturers if they can’t access that power. In addition to expanding generation, the focus of our state’s energy policy must center on developing a meaningful plan to streamline transmission development or address permitting bottlenecks.

Manufacturers are not opposed to clean energy. In fact, we’ve led the way on efficiency and emissions reduction. But any policy must be grounded in reality and avoid high-cost mandates that are missing well-defined guardrails, especially at a time when businesses and households can least afford these added burdens. It is possible to advance our environmental goals while keeping Illinois affordable, competitive, and reliable.

As lawmakers return to Springfield, they have a chance to reset and refocus and avoid the mistakes of the past.

Illinois manufacturers are ready to help build a brighter energy future. That means going back to the table, listening to stakeholders, and drafting policy that focuses on what really matters: reliable generation, strong transmission, and affordable rates.

While catalyzing the economy, the Sparrows Point project simultaneously strengthens our national security.
With or without federal support, USW members will do what we always do.","The U.S. Department of Transportation showed an alarming disregard for the nation’s security a few weeks ago by clawing back a $47.3 million grant intended to launch a new era of steel production at Sparrows Point.

Members of our union, the United Steelworkers (USW), are profoundly disappointed by the Trump administration’s abandonment of a project primed to create jobs, boost manufacturing capacity and meet our country’s growing energy needs.

But it’s important to emphasize that the government’s turnabout represents only a setback, not the end of this forward-looking initiative.

The USW and our partner, US Wind, remain committed to bringing steel back to Baltimore and injecting new life into Sparrows Point. We’re confident that this site, once the home of the largest steel mill in the world, has yet another pivotal role to play in America’s future.

The USW and US Wind joined forces about four years ago. We intend to use a portion of the mill property to build monopiles — the huge foundations sunk into the seabed to support wind turbines — through a new company called Sparrows Point Steel.

Over the full scope of US Wind’s offshore projects, the company will consume more than 330,000 metric tons of steel plate, a huge boon to the steel industry. This is directly in line with the Trump administration’s stated goal of building more in America — and makes the administration’s cancellation of the grant all the more puzzling.

Current projections call for Sparrows Point Steel to employ more than 500 USW members in production, maintenance and a variety of other roles. We’re talking about good-paying, middle-class jobs that enable workers to support their families and lift up the entire community.

Our commitment to building out the wind energy supply chain means sourcing not only our steel plate but many other kinds of materials and supplies from domestic producers. In all, workers from nearly 50 companies across Maryland will benefit from vendor relationships with Sparrows Point Steel.

On top of that, US Wind intends to establish an operations and maintenance center at the harbor in West Ocean City. This facility will coordinate turbine and substation maintenance for offshore wind developments, creating still more jobs in the manufacturing, maritime and energy sectors.

But there’s more. While catalyzing the economy, the Sparrows Point project simultaneously strengthens our national security.

Our work will help to position America as the leader in a global, evolving industry. It will also help to deliver a more reliable energy supply at a time of growing demand and more frequent disruptions in the power grid resulting from climate change.

Marylanders get this.

A recent poll found that seven out of 10 respondents support the construction of wind projects off the Maryland coast because of their potential to stabilize energy prices, enhance the nation’s energy supply and reduce pollution.

The respondents’ support cut across political lines, underscoring the high stakes. What’s more, 81% opposed the reversal of offshore wind projects already underway out of concern for job losses, according to the survey, conducted by Turn Forward, a nonprofit supporting wind energy.

Sparrows Point is hallowed ground for the USW.

At one time, tens of thousands of union members worked here, producing the steel that built the middle class, fueled prosperity and made America a superpower.

We now have an opportunity to build on that legacy — to harness manufacturing and energy for a stronger future.

With or without federal support, USW members will do what we always do. Alongside our partners at US Wind, we’ll get the job done.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/20210803_104844-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 06:59:48.917937

Bill Cassidy on Thursday offered a full-throated defense of President Donald Trump’s energy policies, saying the administration seeks to foster the development of new clean energy technologies without forcing taxpayers to subsidize industries that aren’t ready to stand on their own.

Cassidy, a Republican facing a tough reelection battle next year, said Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed by Congress in July, puts sensible limits on clean energy subsidies while supporting advances in carbon capture and storage, high-tech fuels and other energy innovation.

“The Biden administration created overly generous subsidies for industries that would lower the carbon footprint,” Cassidy said in an interview in New Orleans during a break at the Louisiana Energy Security Summit. “President Trump and the Republican Congress said this can't just be a money grab for industry. It has to be something that gets you on your feet, and then you become commercially viable.”

He added that the president’s efforts to reopen shuttered nuclear power plants also will create more carbon-free energy to fuel domestic demand driven by the advent of power-hungry AI data centers.

Thursday's energy summit was hosted by the American Council for Capital Formation, a pro-business think tank that advocates for free market policies.

More than 250 energy industry executives gathered for presentations and networking at the Higgins Hotel in the Warehouse District. Cassidy provided opening and closing remarks, bookending presentations about China’s threat to America’s energy production and supply chain, manufacturing momentum in Louisiana, and how the state’s oil and gas industry strengthens U.S. leadership.

Cassidy's comments defending Trump come three months after passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act enshrined into law dramatic changes to the nation's energy policy, which emphasizes increased domestic oil and gas production at the expense of cleaner and renewable energy sources.

Trump's bill slashed Biden-era tax breaks designed to boost wind and solar power, threatening billions in investments in Louisiana and, critics have said, slowing the state's efforts to grow its clean energy industry at a time when greenhouse gas emissions are contributing to climate change.

Currently, Louisiana has more than a dozen utility-scale solar farms. Though there aren't any land-based wind farms in the state yet, at least five utility-scale wind projects are in development..

The administration has kept in place some tax breaks for hydrogen, battery storage and nuclear plants protects.

Evolving energy industry

Cassidy is gearing up for a 2026 U.S. Senate race that has attracted several competitors who believe the state's senior senator is vulnerable because of his 2021 vote to convict Trump during a second impeachment trial. The race will be Louisiana's first closed primary in decades.

Among Cassidy's challengers are state Treasurer John Fleming, state Sen. Blake Miguez of Lafayette, Public Service Commissioner Eric Skrmetta and St. Tammany Parish Councilwoman Kathy Seiden. All are highlighting their devotion to Trump.

During the interview, Cassidy said Louisiana needs more jobs, better protection from extreme weather, cheaper insurance and better schools to keep up with neighboring Southern states.

“The bayou regions have lost population because, after Ida, the cost of housing went up, families felt insecure and they moved out, so we've got to make our state more secure from things like hurricanes and flooding,” Cassidy said, citing the 18.5-mile, nearly $4 billion hurricane protection system that will stretch from the Bonnet Carre Spillway to Garyville as an important step in the right direction.

Cassidy also highlighted a bill he co-sponsored by Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, that he said would help build domestic energy production of all types. The latest version of the bill, introduced in April, would place a fee on high-pollution imports from international competitors. It is under review by a Senate committee.

Still, customers are experiencing the sting from congestion charges and reliability must-run costs when the grid is tight.","The Department of Energy will proceed with a $1.6 billion loan guarantee for an approximately 5,000-mile-long high-voltage transmission line modernization project owned by American Electric Power, representing one of the few times where the current administration upheld an initiative begun during Mr. Biden’s tenure. The package emphasizes building on existing rights-of-way in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia to increase capacity and relieve congestion without cutting through new swaths of land.

The financing was in its closing stages toward the end of the previous administration and had been under review as part of a broader re-evaluation of energy grants and loans. If allowed to go forward, it sends a pragmatic carve-out message: projects that provide close-at-hand reliability benefits and involve largely low-conflict upgrades that can move faster seem to be okayed.

AEP, one of the nation’s largest transmission owners, believes the effort involves about 13% of its network. The loan guarantee, issued by DOE’s Loan Programs Office (renamed in the Trump era as Energy Dominance Financing Program), lets the utility access lower-cost financing. DOE officials say the more favorable terms will save the company a minimum of $275 million, with ratepayers due for some benefit.

A Loan Guarantee With Swift Grid Impact and Savings

Reconductoring is a quick and cost-effective method to add throughput on the existing towers by swapping out the old wires for new conductors—advanced versions like high-temperature, low-sag designs that can safely move more electricity along the same corridor. It sidesteps the protracted siting battles and environmental reviews that come with new lines, which is a significant advantage in places where public opposition or permitting delays can slow projects for years.

Industry analyses underscore the payoff. The Brattle Group and other grid consultants have found that technologies like reconductoring and its cousin grid-enhancing tech can, in many cases, boost the transfer capacity of expensive lines by double digits, as well as deliver benefits in months or years instead of a decade after they are first installed. Though this AEP package focuses on new wires, similar projects that add so-called dynamic line rating devices—sensors that change the capacity in real time by considering weather—have delivered considerable congestion relief at a low cost.

The stakes are high. Transmission congestion costs across organized markets—now totaling less than $20 billion in recent years—are leading to higher customer bills, and low-cost wind and solar have been curtailed. AEP’s footprint lies at the borders of the PJM, MISO, and SPP markets where you’re especially likely to see transmission constraints manifested through differences in wholesale price spreads.

Why This Program Withstood Administration Scrutiny

The administration has sought to roll back a number of transition-period awards, such as one totaling $467 million in Minnesota aimed at unlocking 28 gigawatts of new generation—predominantly wind and solar—and $250 million in Oregon to connect a slate of renewable projects. It has also singled out a $630 million grant in California’s grid modernization bid to build that state’s grid with advanced conductors and dynamic line ratings, both designed to pull more capacity from existing energy corridors.

So why spare the AEP loan? Three reasons stand out. First, reliability: the North American Electric Reliability Corporation has issued multiple alerts of high risks on the Midwest-Plains grid under peak conditions. Second is customer economics: the guarantee is meant to pass savings on to bills by cutting borrowing costs. Third, fiscal optics: A loan guarantee—the Loan Programs Office has averaged about a 3 percent loss rate historically—is easier to justify favorably than is a direct grant, especially in cases where upgrades have no new routes or eminent domain.

The political math, too, is stacked in favor of incremental victories. Reconductoring provides tangible capacity gains without the years-long controversy that often plagues long-distance lines, and is a neat middle way between doing nothing or undertaking big headline-grabbing build-outs.

Implications For Rates Reliability And Renewables

Power prices in the project area already have a tendency to fall below the national average, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Still, customers are experiencing the sting from congestion charges and reliability must-run costs when the grid is tight. More production capacity can back up peak demand, stabilize price spikes, and attenuate the constriction of wind and solar production in resource-rich areas.

Speed matters. Reconductored projects can be planned and built on a time scale of quarters rather than years, whereas large greenfield transmission lines often require the better part of a decade to get permitted and constructed. That pace of progress jibes with warnings from grid operators and reliability planners that capacity additions and load growth—driven by data centers, electrification and reshoring of industry—are outstripping today’s transmission capacity.

The move is also consistent with continuing federal rulemakings. Recent Federal Energy Regulatory Commission orders seek to promote better long-term transmission planning and clarify backstop siting authority. Near-term upgrades like AEP’s can help narrow the gap while wider reforms take hold.

A Narrow but Prominent Policy Signal on Transmission

This doesn’t mean an acceptance in full of its predecessor’s grid agenda, not least because larger grants are on the chopping block. But it does indicate that the administration is open to backing targeted, low-friction efforts promising reliability and bill savings, even if they are limited in scope.

For both utilities and developers, the message is clear: incremental capacity expansions using existing corridors with consumer benefits are the most likely to get federal support. Whether it extends to meatier, multi-state transmission projects will determine how soon the U.S. can tamp down on congestion, integrate new generation and accommodate growing demand while keeping costs in control.",https://www.findarticles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image_1760740709_1.jpeg,N,,2025-10-18 13:02:07.078320

The solar program is a Biden administration initiative intended to help low-income families access renewable energy, something President Donald Trump has categorized as expensive and unreliable.

Administered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Solar for All program was established by the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022. Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the program’s cancellation in August, citing the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that Trump signed into law in July, which he said eliminated the program’s funding source.

The cancellation puts federal grants to 60 state, local and tribal governments in question, NBC News reported. The program was designed to provide solar panels and battery storage to approximately 900,000 low-income households across the country. Recipients had already begun planning projects based on expected funding.

What’s at stake for states?

California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced two separate lawsuits on behalf of states that received Solar for All grants. One complaint seeks monetary damages and was filed in the Court of Federal Claims. A second suit asking for reinstatement of the program is expected in federal court in Washington state.

Bonta called the EPA’s decision an “illegal termination,” adding that the Trump administration “can try all they want to bend the law, but we will hold them accountable. Every time.”

California stands to lose about $250 million in approved funding. Arizona would forfeit $156 million that was slated to benefit 11,000 low-income households, Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said in Reuters. Mayes said those families could see energy bills jump by 20% without the assistance.

Why did the administration cancel the program?

The Trump administration has consistently opposed federal subsidies for renewable energy projects. Zeldin called Solar for All a “boondoggle” when announcing its termination.

Trump has characterized solar and wind power as expensive, unreliable and unworthy of government backing, as opposed to gas, coal and nuclear, which have received strong support. His administration has rolled back multiple clean energy initiatives that were established under previous leadership.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act provided the legal mechanism to eliminate Solar for All’s funding stream. That law was part of broader efforts to reduce government spending and refocus energy policy away from renewable sources.

What are the other lawsuits over Solar for All?

The states’ Thursday filing joins earlier legal actions from other affected parties.

On Oct. 6, a coalition filed suit in federal court in Rhode Island, The New York Times reported. The lead plaintiff was the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, representing labor unions that had trained workers to install solar panels. The unions were counting on work from a $49.3 million grant to the Rhode Island Office of Energy Resources.

Zooming out, solar waste is still dwarfed by waste from coal and fossil fuel energy.","SAVANNAH, Ga.—What happens when a solar panel dies?

The vexing question hung last week over the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) sustainability conference, the first of its kind for the nonprofit representing America’s solar industry.

According to the International Energy Agency, up to 78 million tons of solar panels are expected to retire around the world by 2050, the largest waste stream of any clean-energy technology in history. Dubbed the “solar waste tsunami,” the wave of these retirements is projected to accelerate through the 2030s and 2040s as the first generation of large-scale solar farms reaches the end of its life.

To get ahead of this looming waste crisis, the Environmental Protection Agency announced in 2023 that it would craft a new rule to reclassify retired solar panels as “universal waste,” a category for materials that need specialized handling, like batteries, pesticides and mercury-containing devices.

“This change in the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act regulations, once finalized,” should benefit the wide variety of establishments generating and managing solar panel waste by providing a clear, practical system for handling discarded solar panels,” the EPA said.

The rulemaking was supposed to begin in June 2025 and be completed by December 2026, according to the EPA’s policymaking timetable in the Federal Registry.

“They were supposed to come out with this proposed rulemaking in June of this year, but we didn’t see that yet,” Anna Weitz, a clean energy engineer with the North Carolina Clean Energy Technology Center, said during a panel discussion on national and local policy on solar panel decommissioning. The technology center tracks policies on solar panel waste.

Asked for comment, the EPA said in an email that it has revised its rulemaking calendar to start in February 2026 and finish by August 2027.

The delay leaves the U.S. without a federal framework for managing millions of tons of panels nearing the end of their 25- to 30-year lifespans.

To understand why solar panel decommissioning and recycling matters and how it works requires knowledge of the materials involved. A solar panel is mostly glass (about 70 to 80 percent), with 10 percent aluminum, 10 percent polymers and a small but valuable mix of silver, copper, tin and lead. To recycle them, those layers have to be painstakingly separated.

Decommissioning is the process of dismantling and disposing of panels that have reached the end of their lives and ensuring the sites they occupied are left safe and stable. Ideally, recycling is part of that process, allowing valuable materials inside the panels to be recovered rather than discarded.

Glass can be reused for new panels or bottles. Silver and copper can be melted down and sold. But lead and other heavy metals are toxic, requiring careful extraction and disposal to prevent leaching into soil or groundwater.

“Solar panels aren’t just an installation, where you leave them and forget them. We have end-of-life solutions that are responsible, that are well thought out, that are … a very attractive business,” said Adam Sokolski, the policy director at EDF Renewables North America, the clean energy subsidiary of the France-owned utility giant.

So far, 35 states have adopted some form of solar decommissioning or waste policy, according to a tracker managed by the N.C. Clean Energy Technology Center. Of them, less than 10 have policies to recycle the retiring panels.

The remaining 15 states, including solar powerhouses Florida and Arizona, still have no statewide rules for retiring of panels. In those places, unless local governments act, most retired panels end up in landfills, where their valuable metals are lost and their toxins can leach into the environment.

New Jersey is one of the few states where both state and local governments oversee solar projects. Its Right to Farm Act requires that projects on farmland include decommissioning as part of their conservation plans, filed with the local soil conservation district. In the Pinelands reserve, developers must add a similar plan to their landscaping proposal. The state doesn’t require funds to be set aside for cleanup, but local governments may.

The demand to properly recycle or dispose of these expired panels has led to a nascent but growing industry of solar panel recyclers, mostly third-party companies that solar companies contract to handle the recycling and disposal process. Many of the recyclers gathered here at the solar industries conference, wanting consistent guidance on how to do their jobs.

Without federal regulations, states have been forced to go their own way, with recyclers following “inconsistent” rules, said Weitz.

“The goal of policy is to establish a level of certainty,” said Connor Hogan, chief financial officer of solar recycling company OnePlanet.

To create stable demand, many of these recyclers want states and local governments to pass a baseline policy of enforcing landfill bans, which would forbid developers from throwing expired solar panels away and instead seek out recycling firms.

A solar decommissioning policy widely panned by the industry was Washington State’s 2017 Photovoltaic Module Stewardship and Takeback Program, which required manufacturers to submit a “stewardship plan” detailing how they would finance and manage the collection and recycling of solar panels sold in the state or risk being barred from the market.

The rule drew strong backlash from the solar industry, which argued the requirements were unclear, burdensome and premature given the lack of recycling infrastructure. The state senate amended the law to delay enforcement to 2030.

Only California and Hawaii have formally reclassified solar panels as universal waste, giving them a clear path for collection and recycling.

For communities, particularly those near large solar farms or waste sites, the absence of federal standards means less oversight of where panels go once decommissioned, raising environmental justice concerns over toxic exposure and missed economic opportunities like job creation from recycling.

The Trump administration has shown little appetite for advancing new federal rules on solar-panel waste; instead, its broader environmental agenda has focused on deregulation, rolling back climate mandates and cutting support for clean energy programs.

In the European Union, solar panels fall under the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment or the WEEE Directive, which makes manufacturers financially responsible for collecting and recycling panels. Since 2018, EU member states were required to recover 85 percent and recycle 80 percent of panels. Untreated panels are banned from landfills.

Industry-led groups like PV Cycle manage takeback systems across Europe, making the EU the world’s most advanced region in solar panel waste regulation.

Zooming out, solar waste is still dwarfed by waste from coal and fossil fuel energy. A Nature Physics paper called solar panel waste “a drop in the ocean” compared to the vast quantities of coal ash, mine tailings and billions of gallons of toxic produced water generated by fossil fuel industries. According to the paper’s estimate, cumulative solar panel waste through 2050 will reach between 54 million and 160 million metric tons, while coal ash alone would be 300 to 800 times greater and oily sludge from crude oil 2 to 5 times larger.

“In fact, we globally produce and manage approximately the same mass of coal ash per month as the amount of [solar panel] module waste we expect to produce over the next 35 years,” the paper’s authors said.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SolarDismantling-1024x530.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 05:58:59.968213

This announcement marks a pivotal moment in the race to develop alternatives to lithium-ion technology that are lower cost, less dependent on critical materials, and suited to local manufacturing.

What the Scientists Have Achieved

Ultra-fast Charging & High Energy Density

The prototype sodium-ion pouch cells engineered by the RISE team boast an energy density of ~180 Wh/kg and volumetric energy of ~ 550 Wh/L

These figures allow them to exceed or rival many lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries currently used in EVs and energy storage

The battery delivers a power output of ~10 kW/kg and maintains ~97 percent capacity across many cycles

Materials & Design Advantages

Importantly, the design uses no cobalt, nickel, copper or lithium — instead relying on more abundant, non-toxic materials

The scientists mention they developed a proprietary electrode design and electrolyte formulation to support fast ion transport and structural stability even under rapid charging

The battery is engineered to remain thermally stable and to function across extreme temperatures — a critical requirement for real world use in India and similar climates

Why This Is Important

Reducing Dependence on Critical Imports

Lithium, cobalt, nickel and copper are subject to supply constraints, geopolitical risk, and high costs. By contrast, sodium is abundant, inexpensive, and available within India. This innovation supports the “Atmanirbhar Bharat” (self-reliant India) vision by reducing reliance on imported critical minerals

Lower Cost & Safer Chemistry

Sodium-ion batteries are inherently more tolerant to abuse, less prone to thermal runaway, and often safer in design. Coupled with lower raw material costs, they could become a competitive alternative to lithium-ion systems, particularly in large scale energy storage and mid-range electric vehicles.

Applications from EVs to Grid Storage

With rapid charging, high power, and robust cycle life, these batteries hold promise for sectors including:

Electric vehicles (2-, 3-, and 4-wheelers)

Renewable energy storage (solar, wind integration)

Microgrids and rural electrification

Backup power systems and heavy machinery

Strategic & Global Impact

If commercialized and scaled, this technology could shift competitive balance in battery manufacturing. India could emerge as a leader in low-cost battery tech, reducing the dominance of established players in China, South Korea, or other major battery producing nations.

Challenges & the Road Ahead

While the announcement is exciting, there remain key challenges and uncertainties before commercialization:

The researchers estimate that commercial applications could be feasible within 2–3 years, depending on development of local supply chains and further scale-up

Context: Sodium-Ion Battery Research Globally

Sodium-ion (Na-ion) battery technology has long been studied as a lower-cost alternative to lithium-ion (Li-ion). The main tradeoffs historically have been lower energy density and slower charging. Researchers worldwide have experimented with novel cathodes (e.g., NASICON, Prussian blue analogs), engineered electrolytes, and nanostructured electrodes to overcome these challenges

In India, earlier work reported a sodium-ion battery that could charge up to 80% in ~6 minutes using a NASICON-type cathode/anode structure, but that design did not reach the same energy densities or fast charge extremes as the RISE innovation. The new RISE result appears to push the envelope further.

The Big Picture: What This Means for India & the World

Energy sovereignty: India can reduce its dependence on imported lithium battery systems, and develop domestic battery manufacturing capabilities.

Cost reduction: More affordable battery storage could make EVs, solar + battery systems, and microgrids much more accessible.

Competitive edge: If the technology scales well, Indian battery firms can compete globally.

Acceleration of clean energy adoption: With faster charging and reliable battery performance, the adoption curve for EVs and renewable energy systems could steepen.

Final Thoughts

The development of a sodium-ion battery in India that can charge to 94% in 5 minutes is a significant scientific and technological milestone. It addresses key challenges of cost, resource dependence, safety, and charging speed. However, the journey from prototype to commercial viability remains long and complex.

If India (or any country) can successfully scale and industrialize this technology, the ripple effects could transform the energy and mobility sectors.

Our performance in this area will ultimately increase investment in new nuclear fuels.” Cory Hatch is a science writer for Idaho National Laboratory.","Instead of clamping down, Maupin maneuvers the clawlike tongs within millimeters of the fuel rod and hovers there. Another operator, Rob Cox, cuts through the fuel rod with a slow-speed diamond saw. The moment Cox finishes the cut, the section of the fuel rod drops away and Maupin snags it in midair with the manipulator tongs.

“Nice catch,” Cox says.

Over the coming months, Cox, Maupin, and their colleagues will repeat this operation dozens of times as they prepare next-generation fuel rods—designed and built by Westinghouse and irradiated in a commercial reactor—for postirradiation examination and testing.

Engineers designed the fuel to be accident tolerant and achieve high burnup.

Accident tolerant characteristics offer improved safety performance during normal operations, power spikes, and reactor accidents. These same characteristics can enable the fuel rods to achieve higher burnup (e.g., increased use of the fissionable uranium-235 in the fuel pellet) that could increase the electricity output of power plants and extend operating cycles—think increased horsepower and better fuel economy.

The stakes are high. These accident tolerant fuels (ATFs) could eventually power the entire U.S. reactor fleet.

Together, these technologies could save electricity ratepayers millions of dollars per year while increasing a nuclear power plant’s resilience under potential (though highly unlikely) accident conditions.

But first, industry and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission need terabytes of data on how those fuels perform. INL is one of the few places in the world with the capabilities and experts to quantify how nuclear fuel behaves during normal operating and accident conditions.

The chance to put high-burnup fuels and ATFs through their paces is the opportunity of a lifetime for the scores of INL experts involved in the tests. Now, after years of preparation, the tests are finally underway.

A long time coming

Discussions of a Westinghouse fuel shipment to INL began roughly a decade ago, but the real history of the fuel rods began in the wake of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and subsequent tsunami. These combined events ravaged the Japanese coastline and severely damaged several reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The plant power supplies and cooling systems for three of the four reactors were disabled, ultimately leading to significant core damage and the release of radioactive materials. This outcome might have been prevented if emergency personnel had more time to navigate washed up debris to deliver emergency electrical power or additional cooling water.

ATFs could provide plant operators with this increased margin for safety during abnormal operating conditions and, during an accident, could provide additional time to implement safety measures.

An added benefit of ATFs is that they can power a reactor longer, a feature known as high burnup. This feature is the nuclear industry’s immediate solution to provide the energy necessary to drive the modern economy, especially emerging needs for data centers driving artificial intelligence applications. Such fuels are designed to produce more energy, burning longer inside conventional light water reactors.

To answer those dual needs, Westinghouse is one of several companies that, under cooperative agreements with the U.S. Department of Energy, developed fuel with accident tolerant and high-burnup characteristics. After three rounds of irradiation testing at INL, the Westinghouse fuel was inserted in a commercial reactor in 2019.

Oak Ridge National Laboratory received a shipment of the Westinghouse fuel in 2021 for examination and testing in its Severe Accident Test Station, and INL received its first shipment of the fuel in December 2023.

Examining the fuel

Shielded by the four-foot-thick, multipaned windows at INL’s Hot Fuel Examination Facility, operators rely on an odd mixture of high and low tech to perform nondestructive and destructive examinations of the fuel and prepare it for irradiation tests. Alongside lasers and gamma spectrometers, there are rows of open-ended wrenches hanging on the wall.

Before Cox and Maupin make the fine cut to the fuel rods with their diamond saw, operators use a regular pipe cutter—the kind a plumber might use—to make a rough cut. The cutting locations are marked using a Sharpie wrapped in tape, which makes the marker easier to grip with the clawlike remote manipulators.

A thorough examination of the fuel rods, which have already sustained 54 months of neutron damage in the commercial reactor, establishes baseline data. This data will help researchers better understand how next-generation fuels might behave in a reactor accident.

“We perform extensive nondestructive examination so we can gather as much information as possible before starting destructive examinations,” said Aaron Colldeweih, lead investigator for the postirradiation examination of the Westinghouse fuel. “We’ll do visual exams, gamma spectrometry, and we’ll closely measure the diameter of the rods. That will give us an idea of how the cladding and the fuel interacted with each other during irradiation.”

As the U-235 in the fuel undergoes fission in the reactor, various radionuclides are created. Gamma spectrometry is used to detect the gamma radiation field being emitted from the rod at incremental steps along its entire length.

“We’re measuring gamma emissions at a very high resolution along the length of the rod,” Colldeweih said. “That allows us to define the location of the physical features that were part of the fuel assembly, like spacer grids or, inside the rod, like individual fuel pellets. This information helps guide us on where we want to cut the fuel rod for destructive examinations.”

Because each radionuclide emits a unique signature, the data also provide a glimpse into the irradiation history of the rod and the chemical behavior of the specific fission product species created by the fission process.

Another examination called profilometry closely measures surface dimensions of the rod. When those data are compared with the fuel rod’s original measurements, researchers can calculate how much the cladding dimensions changed over the lifetime of the fuel, where the cladding initially shrinks down around the fuel pellets and then expands as the fuel swells (primarily due to internal gas pressure). The internal pressure increases throughout irradiation as gaseous fission products accumulate inside the fuel rod. This measurement is used to estimate the remaining margin to failure.

Segmentation and destructive tests

Now the fuel rod is ready for segmentation and destructive tests, including irradiation tests, in the Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) or in the Transient Reactor Test (TREAT) Facility at INL’s Materials and Fuels Complex.

Using a laser, researchers make a tiny puncture in the cladding to sample the fission gases that formed during irradiation and directly measure the gas pressure and the free volume within the rod. Samples of the gas are collected to perform compositional analysis.

“We start with13-foot-long fuel rods, and we need to get them into segments of about 10 inches for future TREAT tests,” Colldeweih said. “It involves fine cutting with very high accuracy. We also take a number of different samples from each fuel rod for isotopic and hydrogen measurements that ultimately support additional experiments required to understand material behavior and properties relevant to future fuel rod design.”

Experts then cut away sections of the cladding and fuel and prepare the samples for examination under conventional microscopes and electron microscopes at INL.

The microscopes allow researchers to see damage and changes that occurred during irradiation, such as cracks and pores in the fuel. The microscopes can also help identify where hydrogen-bearing phases, called hydrides, have precipitated in the cladding. These hydrides, which mostly arise from corrosion of the cladding in the reactor, can cause the cladding to become embrittled. Measuring that hydrogen provides important clues to understand damage incurred in the reactor core.

“There are interesting regions in the shape of rings to indicate how the fuel’s microstructure has evolved,” Colldeweih said. “It’s what happens to the fuel after it has been irradiated for a length of time, and it’s important for understanding how the fuel will behave in an accident scenario—and for understanding what’s going to happen in TREAT.”

Other samples of the cladding are subjected to mechanical tests that push, pull, or expand the sample to its breaking point to test its strength. “We will mill out different dog-bone shapes from the cladding wall, and we can test the sample strength in different directions,” Colldeweih said. “We perform axial-tension tests and hoop-tension tests, which allow us to measure the mechanical response of the material.”

Researchers also take density measurements of the fuel to learn how fission gases—which cause tiny bubbles and create porosity—and thermal expansion have changed the fuel’s density. “We want to know if the density changed from its nominal value and how that affects its performance and accident tolerance,” Colldeweih said.

The ultimate test: Accident conditions in TREAT

Much like the automobile industry, safety features must be demonstrated under extreme conditions to validate their performance. The hot cell examinations ultimately culminate in the nuclear equivalent of ramming several sports cars into a concrete wall.

In this case, sports cars are advanced fuel rods and the concrete wall is TREAT: a nuclear test reactor designed to deliver a short, high-intensity burst of radiation to push nuclear fuels and materials to their limit and beyond. In other words, TREAT is designed to break things under accident scenarios, much like crash testing a car.

“We want to know if a fuel will fail in a reactor and how it will fail,” said Jordan Argyle, one of the researchers involved in refabricating the fuel rods for the tests. “The only way to find out is to do the testing.”

“This may be the coolest thing happening at [INL’s Materials and Fuels Complex],” Argyle continued.

Fabricating rodlets for accident testing

The rodlet must be capable of withstanding internal pressures of over 1,000 psi to accommodate the fission gases that result from the tests.

Once the rodlet is ready, “we need to load in a bunch of rodlet internals,” Argyle said. “There are pellets of a ceramic material that create a thermal buffer to keep heat from melting the end caps. They also help replicate the thermodynamics of a big fuel rod in a reactor. There are also springs to keep it all together. It’s an extremely tight fit.”

Then the end caps are welded onto the cladding. Throughout this process, experts use spotting scopes—the same kind that hunters use—to inspect the weld.

Technicians then use a small hole, 20 thousandths of an inch in diameter, through which they inject a mixture of helium and argon gases to replicate the thermal properties of a fission gas mixture. That hole is then welded shut.

The endcaps are heavily instrumented so researchers can get live data out of the fuel rod while it is in the reactor. These sensors measure everything from acoustic emissions and capsule pressure to temperature and mechanical movement.

“We just completed the easiest fabrication,” Argyle said. “They’re going to continue to get more complicated. Some of the sensors have wires, and you have to be careful not to destroy the wires. Some have much more volume and much higher pressures, and they’re talking about welding thermocouples [devices that measure temperature] directly onto the cladding.”

Once experts have segmented the 13-foot fuel rods and taken samples of the fuel and the cladding, each segment must be reassembled into a sealed rodlet for insertion into the transient water irradiation system (TWIST) capsule—an experiment capsule designed for specialized testing. The process requires a high degree of precision for the rodlet to perform like a normal fuel rod.

“The purpose of refabrication is to get it as prototypical as possible to a real fuel rod,” Argyle said.

Completing each rodlet takes a team of dedicated experts. “There are probably 26 people, from receipt to welding, who are integral to this process,” Argyle said. “If you took any one of those people away, we wouldn’t be able to do this.”

Once the rodlet is assembled and tested in the rodlet holder, the TWIST device is assembled, and the rodlet is loaded inside. This integrated configuration—the TWIST capsule—is then ready for the experiment.

To ensure safety, once the TWIST module is assembled, it is placed inside an irradiation system known as Big-BUSTER (broad use specimen transient experiment rig). The 9-foot-long zirconium-niobium alloy pipe provides the safety pressure boundary used for irradiation testing in TREAT.

The experiment, housed in Big-BUSTER, is transferred to TREAT via a shielded cask. The experiment is then inserted into TREAT and all instrumentation is checked out to determine functionality after shipping and handling.

INL technicians will fabricate three more rodlets in the next fiscal year, with two to six rodlets fabricated each year thereafter for the foreseeable future.

“The sheer volume of data we’re able to collect has a lot of people interested,” Argyle said.

Mimicking accident scenarios

One type of test performed in the TWIST device is a loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA), a type of postulated accident in a commercial power plant where the water drains out of reactor core due to a highly unlikely severe disruption of its mechanical systems. In this scenario, the core could heat up, resulting in several potential consequences, including a release of radioactivity due to fuel damage (popularly referred to as a meltdown). Next-generation nuclear fuels like the ATF rods from Westinghouse are designed to minimize the chance and severity of these consequences.

TWIST looks a little like a barbell tipped on its end and features two chambers. The top chamber—the TWIST capsule—holds nuclear fuel, water, and instrumentation.

During a LOCA test, TREAT reactor operators bombard the fuel, surrounded by water, in the TWIST capsule with an intense burst of radiation for around 30 seconds. This burst of radiation establishes thermal conditions like a normal operating fuel pin in a commercial reactor. Then, the accident event simulation starts by draining the water into an empty tank at the bottom chamber of the TWIST capsule.

Operators then subject the fuel rod, minus the water, to a lower-level radiation burst for 100 additional seconds, simulating the fuel rods’ residual heat generation during an accident. Both the irradiation times and TREAT power levels can be easily modified by the experimenter and are adjusted based on the test’s specific objectives.

Normally, the rodlet increases in temperature until the specimen fails, acccording to Klint Anderson, an experiment design engineer at INL. “In other words, the rod gets really hot,” he said. “This increase in temperature, combined with the pressure differential between the pressurized rod and lower-pressure capsule, can cause the cladding to balloon and burst.”

While a loss-of-coolant condition (known as an undercooling scenario) is the more restrictive safety event, the system can also be used to explore other types of events, such as reactivity insertion accidents (known as overpower scenarios). In a reactivity insertion accident test, TREAT operators bombard the submerged fuel rod with a pulse of neutron radiation that simulates sudden removal of a control rod from a commercial reactor core. During this test, the water never drains from the TWIST capsule.

“The water remains at the same water level the whole time,” Anderson said. “We put it in TREAT with a higher-power pulse to look at things like the pellet cladding mechanical interaction or sudden pressure spikes from the water quickly boiling.”

Once the experiments are completed in TREAT, the rodlets will be transferred back to the Hot Fuel Examination Facility for disassembly and post-transient examinations, which will occur over the summer and fall of 2025.

Why these tests are important

In the end, “crash testing” these high-burnup and ATF rods will help industry license these rods’ designs for reactors operating across the country. The result is safer, higher-performing nuclear reactors.

“The advanced fuel is special because it marks a new era of innovation for commercial LWRs,” said Dan Wachs, national technical director of the DOE’s Advanced Fuels Campaign at INL.

“Innovation in the LWR community stagnated for several decades,” he said. “The start of the Accident Tolerant Fuels program really started a reawakening of the desire for innovation in the commercial nuclear reactor sector.”

It took about 10 years to get the initial ideas for advanced fuels to the point where researchers could perform demonstrations in commercial reactors.

“But to really assess them properly, we need to do examinations in our hot cells,” Wachs said.

INL is one of the best and, in some cases, the only place for companies to get data about their fuels to verify their performance and ultimately get approval from the NRC. With the success of the initial experiments in TREAT, the nuclear energy industry will gain confidence that its innovations can be commercialized.

“By examining and testing fuels from Westinghouse and other manufacturers, INL researchers are providing industry with a clear pathway to get their fuels to market,” Wachs said. “Success just generates an appetite for more innovation. Our performance in this area will ultimately increase investment in new nuclear fuels.”

The proposed BESS fire safety codes will go a long way to reduce the risk of thermal runaways within new BESS installations in New York.

Standardise fire safety codes: Fragmented fire safety codes and regulations create headaches for developers and confusion across the industry.
Moving forward, BESS safety codes should introduce stronger fire safety protections.","New York State is one of the biggest advocates of battery energy storage systems (BESS) technology in the US, setting an ambitious target of 6GW of energy storage by 2030. They are pushing ahead with multiple new projects despite significant headwinds from community opposition groups. In the last year alone, the state broke ground on 7.5MW of capacity and approved a further five BESS projects totalling 42.5MW.

Yet a string of isolated, high-profile BESS fires over the last few years in the state (Jefferson, Orange, and Suffolk counties) has created public unease about the technology and emboldened local opposition groups that threaten projects at a pivotal stage in the energy transition. Local opposition groups have also increasingly used evocative language, such as “BESS is a clear and present danger to our health and financial well-being”, to stir up opposition to projects.

In response, State officials have introduced a new set of BESS fire safety codes aimed at addressing public concerns and enhancing site safety. While New York’s BESS fire safety codes represent a crucial first step for BESS safety, serving as a regulatory model for other states, more must be done to protect sites and reassure communities about their safety.

The proposed BESS fire safety codes will go a long way to reduce the risk of thermal runaways within new BESS installations in New York. It is a welcome innovation of public policy that will support BESS adoption.

Why New York’s fire safety codes are a good start

Until now, there have been only a very limited number of fire safety codes or regulations specifically designed to protect BESS sites against fire risks. That’s why New York’s new BESS fire safety codes – officially adopted in July this year (2025) – mark a significant step forward for the industry when it comes to fire safety. Under the new codes, developers are required to:

These new codes clearly set a solid baseline for fire safety standards within the BESS industry, and they will go some way to reassuring the public that sites are being properly protected. However, the new safety codes do not go as far as offering guidance for developers/owners to include fire safety protection – a key talking point for community action groups. Without strong fire safety protections, New York and the industry as a whole risk stalling the rollout of BESS sites, held up by influential community groups. Given the recent flurry of high-profile isolated BESS fires, the safety code detailing requirements to protect sites will help mitigate community opposition.

Strengthening fire safety standards to build public trust

To address public safety concerns and gain support from critics, regulators, and developers must collaborate to establish comprehensive fire safety regulations that include:

1. Mandate advanced fire detection and suppression systems: Requiring all BESS sites to have advanced fire detection and suppression systems installed from the start is critical to winning over opponents. In fact, a recent report from Firetrace International, which surveyed nearly 4,000 citizens across the US, found that 66% of US citizens would support a BESS project if fire suppression systems were installed from the outset.

2. Standardise fire safety codes: Fragmented fire safety codes and regulations create headaches for developers and confusion across the industry. By establishing consistent and clear fire safety standards across the industry, we can enhance fire protection, ultimately helping to alleviate public opposition.

3. Transparent incident reporting: Making sure developers share data and information on recent fire incidents is essential to improving safety standards and updating fire safety codes. This includes creating public databases that regulators, firefighters, developers, and the public can access to see what went wrong, what was fixed, and how sites are being made safer.

4. Disclose fire safety plans: Requiring developers to disclose their fire safety plans and the steps they have taken to protect sites will go a long way to securing public support. Firetrace’s survey found that 47% of US citizens would be more comfortable with a BESS site if they had a clear understanding of the safety measures, demonstrating the importance of introducing fire safety disclosure requirements.

The successful rollout of BESS hinges on the industry reassuring the public that sites are safe, secure, and will create significant benefits for the community. But, as it stands, many locals are concerned about having BESS sites in their backyard, which is understandable given the recent isolated fires that have hit the front pages.

As an industry, we need to do more to reassure the public that BESS is a relatively safe technology and demonstrate that we’re doing all we can to protect sites and improve safety standards. New York’s new fire safety codes are a significant first step toward achieving this. Moving forward, BESS safety codes should introduce stronger fire safety protections. This will help win over community opposition groups and accelerate the rollout of one of the most important technologies of our generation, which is vital for achieving sustainability targets such as net-zero by 2050.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltb299798942522069/bltfe9b47e05a5cb35d/68f2850c8fbaca10462a3884/BESS.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-18 14:03:57.496930

Unlike other public two-year colleges, Texas State Technical College does not have taxing authority to issue bonds, and underfunding has led to a halt in critical capital improvements.
The state would help pick up the tab for the amount of property tax revenue school districts would lose.","On Nov. 4, Texas voters will get the final say on 17 constitutional amendments — usually listed as statewide propositions at the top of the ballot — including billions of dollars in property tax cuts for homeowners and businesses.

Earlier this year, a two-thirds majority of the state Legislature passed the joint resolutions calling for the constitutional amendment elections, along with the state’s budget for the next two years, which includes $51 billion for property tax cuts.

Texas lawmakers have used multibillion-dollar budget surpluses, the result of inflation and temporary federal stimulus dollars during the COVID-19 pandemic, to pay for tax cuts in recent years. Proponents of tax cuts and bans, including Gov. Greg Abbott, have said they will maintain Texas as a competitive, business-friendly state and contribute to economic growth.

But some lawmakers and budget analysts have raised concerns that passing more tax cuts, especially on school district taxes which the state helps pay for, could be unsustainable.

“We always have to kind of balance giving folks tax relief versus making sure that we still preserve revenue for those public services,” said Shannon Halbrook, a fiscal policy director for the left-leaning Every Texan.

With lots of tax cuts and tax bans, especially through these upcoming constitutional amendment elections, the state and local governments could face a hard time paying for public services such as education, health care, and infrastructure needs in the future, Halbrook said.

Officials with Texas cities and counties say they are already being forced to either cut spending or raise taxes and fees to make up for budgets stretched thin by economic uncertainty, inflation, strict state limits on property tax collections and uncertainty around future federal funds. That’s why some Texans, like voters in Austin, will also see local propositions asking them to approve increasing local property tax rates.

If the constitutional amendments are approved, a majority of state lawmakers and Texas voters would need to pass new constitutional amendments to undo measures. Constitutional amendments are the only ballot propositions Texans get to vote on at the state level and will appear on the top of voters’ ballots, above any local races or measures they may be deciding.

To weigh in on the constitutional amendments, Texas voters need to be registered to vote by Oct. 6. Early voting will run from Oct. 20-31, and election day is Nov. 4. The deadline for counties to receive applications to vote by mail is Oct. 24. For more information on voting requirements, read our guide to voting in Texas.

Here’s a brief breakdown of the constitutional amendments.

A majority of the proposed constitutional amendments are measures meant to lower taxes for various Texans, including:

Homeowners.

Businesses.

Elderly and disabled homeowners.

Spouses of veterans.

Homeowners who had their home destroyed in a fire.

Property owners with border security infrastructure.

Those who sell animal feed.

Other proposed amendments would prevent the state from imposing additional taxes on:

Personal or business capital gains.

Securities transactions and those working in securities.

Inheritances.

Other proposals would fund:

Water infrastructure.

The Texas State Technical College.

Research on dementia treatment and prevention.

What it means: This amendment would create an endowment for the Texas State Technical College Program.

Unlike other public two-year colleges, Texas State Technical College does not have taxing authority to issue bonds, and underfunding has led to a halt in critical capital improvements. If voters approve the constitutional amendment, TSTC officials have said they will use the money to fix campus infrastructure, upgrade classroom equipment and expand its footprint across the state.

This comes after Gov. Greg Abbott made workforce training a priority during the regular legislative session. Texas employers have been signaling a decline in skilled workers for fields such as plumbing and welding, saying this could threaten Texas’ economy.

Proponents of this allocation of funds say it would help build facilities for training and close the skills gap in Texas. Critics have said creating an endowment for TSTC would limit government spending oversight and transparency. — Olla Mokhtar, Sneha Dey

Proposition 2 (SJR 18): Capital gains tax ban

The ballot language: “The constitutional amendment prohibiting the imposition of a tax on the realized or unrealized capital gains of an individual, family, estate, or trust.”

What it means: This would ban the state from taxing people or businesses on profits or potential profits from capital assets, such as investments, real estate, valuable items and certain personal property. It would also eliminate a franchise tax on business trusts, which would lead the state to lose an estimated $152,000 in revenue per fiscal year, according to the state comptroller’s office.

Proponents of the capital gains tax ban say it doubles down on the state’s income tax ban, which was approved by voters in 2019. State lawmakers suggested in an analysis they don’t want to repeat what happened in Washington state where officials there enacted a capital gains tax despite also prohibiting a state income tax. And during legislative discussions, state Rep. Giovanni Capriglione, a Republican from Southlake who sponsored the proposal, said that the franchise tax on business trusts “could be construed as a capital gains tax undermining Texas economic competitiveness.” — María Méndez

Proposition 3 (SJR 5): Bail reform

The ballot language: “The constitutional amendment requiring the denial of bail under certain circumstances to persons accused of certain offenses punishable as a felony.”

What it means: This proposition would require judges to deny bail in certain cases for individuals accused of committing specific felonies, such as murder, aggravated assault and indecency with a child. The state would have to demonstrate that bail is not enough to prevent the defendant from being a flight or public safety risk. Defendants, who are legally presumed innocent, would also be entitled to the right to an attorney during their bail hearings.

The proposal is part of a broad legislative package that Texas Republican leaders have said is needed to reduce violent crimes committed by people out on bond and to curb the ability of “activist judges” to set “weak bail.” Civil rights groups said keeping more people behind bars would add to overcrowded jails without actually improving public safety, while also pointing to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that says “liberty is the norm, and detention prior to trial or without trial is the carefully limited exception.”

Under the Texas Constitution, most defendants have the right to be released on bail except for certain cases, such as those charged with capital murder or accused of certain repeat felonies. — Alex Nguyen

Proposition 4 (HJR 7): Water infrastructure funding

The ballot language: “The constitutional amendment to dedicate a portion of the revenue derived from state sales and use taxes to the Texas water fund and to provide for the allocation and use of that revenue.”

What it means: Texas’ water supply is facing numerous threats, including an increasing demand for water due to rapid population growth, millions of gallons of water leaking out of old infrastructure, and climate change contributing to more droughts and altering precipitation patterns. By one estimate, the state’s municipal supply will not meet demand by 2030 if a major drought were to hit the state and no water solutions are implemented.

A Texas 2036 report estimated that the state needs nearly $154 billion by 2050 for water infrastructure, including $59 billion for water supply projects, $74 billion for leaky pipes and infrastructure maintenance, and $21 billion to fix broken wastewater systems.

To help the state boost and protect its water supply, state lawmakers are asking voters to approve $20 billion for water projects over the next two decades. If approved, up to $1 billion of sales tax revenue would be deposited into the Texas Water Fund each year starting in 2027. The money would go to fixing aging pipes and other infrastructure; developing and increasing new water sources, such as desalination; flood mitigation projects; and supporting conservation efforts to help meet water demands.The amendment would also give the Texas Water Development Board flexibility in distributing funds. — Alejandra Martinez

Proposition 5 (HJR 99): Tax exemption on animal feed

The ballot language: “The constitutional amendment authorizing the legislature to exempt from ad valorem taxation tangible personal property consisting of animal feed held by the owner of the property for sale at retail.”

What it means: This constitutional amendment would allow state lawmakers to extend tax exemptions on animal feed to include when animal feed is held as inventory to be sold. State Rep. Cody Harris, R-Palestine, noted animal feed is already typically tax exempt when it is harvested or purchased by a farmer or rancher.

If the constitutional amendment is approved, accompanying legislation from Harris would exempt animal feed inventory from property taxes. That would lower local property tax revenue and require the state to help school districts make up for that loss, but those costs are not expected to be significant, according to a fiscal note from the state’s Legislative Budget Board.

Only a few individuals registered against the proposed constitutional amendment during legislative committee hearings. Critics have said this gives animal feed sellers an unfair advantage, according to the House Research Organization. — María Méndez

Proposition 6 (HJR 4): Securities tax ban

The ballot language: “The constitutional amendment prohibiting the legislature from enacting a law imposing an occupation tax on certain entities that enter into transactions conveying securities or imposing a tax on certain securities transactions.”

What it means: This proposal would prevent the state from creating new taxes on securities transactions, such as stock trading, and from taxing those who operate or work in the securities market, including financial institutions, brokers and dealers.

It was prompted by a new stock exchange expected to open in Texas and to protect investments, including retirement accounts and pensions, following discussions of taxing financial transactions in other states, according to analysis of the resolution calling for the constitutional amendment.

A few individuals registered against the proposal during legislative committee hearings, and critics have said the state could benefit from these taxes should it need to raise more revenue in the future, according to the House Research Organization. — María Méndez

Proposition 7 (HJR 133): Tax exemption for veterans’ spouses

The ballot language: “The constitutional amendment authorizing the legislature to provide for an exemption from ad valorem taxation of all or part of the market value of the residence homestead of the surviving spouse of a veteran who died as a result of a condition or disease that is presumed under federal law to have been service-connected.”

What it means: This change would allow state lawmakers to give property tax breaks on homes to the un-remarried spouses of U.S. veterans who the federal government determined died in connection to their service. State Rep. Chris Turner, D-Grand Prairie, said during legislative discussions that the change is meant to align Texas with a more recent federal law that expanded benefits for veterans exposed to toxic substances during their service.

Accompanying legislation by Turner would exempt qualifying spouses of veterans from paying any property taxes on their home if they have not remarried. The state would have to make up the reduced property tax revenue for local school districts, but it is not expected to be a significant cost, according to a fiscal note from the state’s Legislative Budget Board. An estimated 3,000 spouses could potentially benefit from the exemption, according to the fiscal note. — María Méndez

Proposition 8 (HJR 2): Inheritance tax ban

The ballot language: “The constitutional amendment to prohibit the legislature from imposing death taxes applicable to a decedent’s property or the transfer of an estate, inheritance, legacy, succession, or gift.”

What it means: Though Texas does not currently have an inheritance tax, this measure aims to prevent lawmakers from trying to impose a tax on an estate or when an estate or inheritance is transferred. It would not eliminate other existing taxes that can be associated with an inheritance, such as unpaid property taxes, according to committee discussions on the proposal. Critics of this constitutional amendment have said it is unnecessary and would limit state lawmakers in the future, according to the House Research Organization. — María Méndez

Proposition 9 (HJR 1): Inventory and equipment tax exemption

The ballot language: “The constitutional amendment to authorize the legislature to exempt from ad valorem taxation a portion of the market value of tangible personal property a person owns that is held or used for the production of income.”

What it means: This amendment, along with accompanying legislation, would exempt up to $125,000 of businesses’ inventory or equipment from being taxed by school districts, cities, counties or any other taxing entity. Under current law, businesses don’t have to pay taxes on that property if it’s worth $2,500 or less.

The state would help pick up the tab for the amount of property tax revenue school districts would lose. This would cost the state an estimated $193.5 million from general revenue in 2027 and more than $100 million annually from general revenue in subsequent fiscal years, according to a fiscal note from the Legislative Budget Board. Other taxing entities like cities and counties would either have to raise tax rates to make up for the lost revenue, or go without it.

Critics, including some local officials, have noted that the tax cuts could be applied by businesses at multiple locations, according to the House Research Organization. Proponents, including several business and industry associations, have said eliminating administrative and tax burdens for businesses would contribute to economic growth that could outweigh local revenue losses. Recapture payments, or the tax revenue that school districts with higher property values send back to the state to help fund poorer school districts, would also go down. — María Méndez, Joshua Fechter

Proposition 10 (SJR 84): Tax exemption for homes destroyed by fire

The ballot language: “The constitutional amendment to authorize the legislature to provide for a temporary exemption from ad valorem taxation of the appraised value of an improvement to a residence homestead that is completely destroyed by a fire.”

What it means: This amendment and accompanying legislation would create a process to temporarily lower property taxes on homes destroyed by fire. Homeowners could apply for an adjusted tax bill on the restored home for the year in which the fire occurred, according to the accompanying legislation. To qualify, the homeowner’s home would have to remain uninhabitable for at least 30 days after the fire. These property tax bill reductions could lower local tax revenue and require the state to help make up for school districts’ losses, but potential costs for the state could not be calculated, according to the legislation’s fiscal note. — María Méndez

Proposition 11 (SJR 85): School tax exemption for the elderly or disabled homeowners

The ballot language: “The constitutional amendment authorizing the legislature to increase the amount of the exemption from ad valorem taxation by a school district of the market value of the residence homestead of a person who is elderly or disabled.”

What it means: This constitutional amendment would allow the state to raise a homestead exemption, a discount on school property taxes that lowers how much of a home’s value can be taxed to pay for public schools. The increased exemption would shave off $60,000 from the taxable value of elderly or disabled Texans’ homes, rather than just $10,000 under the current exemption.

Coupled with another homestead exemption generally available to Texas homeowners, which lawmakers are also asking voters to increase to $140,000 through another ballot proposition, elderly or disabled Texans could get homestead exemptions of up to $200,000 if the other proposition is also approved by voters.

If the increased exemption for elderly or disabled homeowners is approved by voters, the state would have to help pay for revenue school districts lose. That could cost the state more than $1.2 billion in general revenue for the next two fiscal years and upwards of $477 million annually after that, according to a fiscal note from the state’s Legislative Budget Board. Recapture payments, or the tax revenue that school districts with higher property values send back to the state to help fund poorer school districts, would also go down.

Though these tax cuts for elderly and disabled Texans haven’t faced much public pushback, some have raised concerns that such broad exemptions could be unsustainable for the state to pay for in the future. — María Méndez, Joshua Fechter

Proposition 12 (SJR 27): Changing the State Judicial Conduct Commission

The ballot language: “The constitutional amendment regarding the membership of the State Commission on Judicial Conduct, the membership of the tribunal to review the commission’s recommendations, and the authority of the commission, the tribunal, and the Texas Supreme Court to more effectively sanction judges and justices for judicial misconduct.”

What it means: This amendment would change the make-up of Texas’ State Commission on Judicial Conduct and related processes and powers.

Currently, the State Commission on Judicial Conduct is made up of the following:

six judges from six different court levels,

two attorneys appointed by the State Bar of Texas who aren’t judges, and

five citizens appointed by the governor who are at least 30 years of age and aren’t attorneys or judges.

If approved, the constitutional amendment would beef up the citizen representation on the commission by changing the makeup to:

six judges or justices of courts appointed by the Texas Supreme Court of, two of whom would have to be trial court judges (judicial members of the commission would not be allowed to be judges in the same type of court), and

seven citizens appointed by the governor, who are at least 35 years of age.

Commission members would still have to be confirmed by the Texas Senate.

Other significant changes to the judicial conduct review process would tweak how the chief justice of the Texas Supreme Court selects review tribunals. These tribunals, made up of seven Court of Appeals justices, review the commission’s recommendation for the removal or retirement of a judge. The amendment would also adjust when and how the commission and review tribunal would have to discipline judges, including in some cases by prohibiting a person from holding judicial office in the future.

The terms of the current commissioners would expire by July 2026. A temporary provision in the constitutional amendment would authorize the Texas Supreme Court and the governor to begin appointing additional commissioners with staggered terms, of either six, four or two years, beginning in 2026.

Proponents of the proposed changes said they would promote transparency and accountability in the judicial system and allow judicial misconduct to be addressed fairly and swiftly. Some critics said that increasing the number of members of the public on the commission could politicize the judicial discipline process, according to the House Research Organization. — María Méndez

Proposition 13 (SJR 2): Increased school tax exemption for homeowners

The ballot language: “The constitutional amendment to increase the amount of the exemption of residence homesteads from ad valorem taxation by a school district from $100,000 to $140,000.”

What it means: This constitutional amendment would allow Texans who own their home to see a boost in the state’s homestead exemption, or the slice of a home’s value that can’t be taxed to pay for public schools. The proposal would shave off $140,000 off the taxable value of the home, instead of the current $100,000.

The owner of a typical Texas home — valued at $302,000 last year, according to Zillow — would have saved about $490 on their school property taxes had the higher exemption been in place last year, a Tribune calculation shows. Those savings result from a combination of the increased homestead exemption and cuts to school tax rates in the state’s upcoming two-year budget.

Accompanying legislation would put the state on the hook for the revenue school districts lose if the increased exemption passes. That’s estimated to cost the state more than $2.7 billion in general revenue for the 2026-2027 budget cycle and more than $1 billion annually after that, according to the fiscal note for the accompanying school finance legislation. Recapture payments, or the tax revenue that school districts with higher property values send back to the state to help fund poorer school districts, would also go down.

Some critics have said the state should do more to limit local tax rates and spending so that tax bills don’t continue to rise, according to the House Research Organization. — María Méndez, Joshua Fechter

Proposition 14 (SJR 3): Funding for dementia research and prevention

The ballot language: “The constitutional amendment providing for the establishment of the Dementia Prevention and Research Institute of Texas, establishing the Dementia Prevention and Research Fund to provide money for research on and prevention and treatment of dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and related disorders in this state, and transferring to that fund $3 billion from state general revenue.”

What it means: This amendment would provide $3 billion to create the Dementia Prevention and Research Institute of Texas to study dementia, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s disease and other brain related conditions. The measure received bipartisan support from a majority of lawmakers and was one of Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick’s legislative priorities.

If voters approve the constitutional amendment, an initial $3 billion in state surplus revenue would be transferred to the fund, and a board appointed by Patrick, House Speaker Dustin Burrows, R-Lubbock, and Gov. Greg Abbott would be set up to approve research proposals. Going forward, the institute would receive up to $300 million annually. This funding is intended to attract physicians, researchers, and experts to Texas.

The fund and institute are modeled after the state’s Cancer Research and Prevention Institute, which has become the country’s second largest funder of cancer research. — Olla Mokhtar, Terri Langford

Proposition 15 (SJR 34): Codifying parental rights

The ballot language: “The constitutional amendment affirming that parents are the primary decision makers for their children.”

What it means: This proposal would include parental rights, as currently outlined out in federal case law, in the Texas Constitution. The intent of the amendment is to protect parental rights since “case law can change and disappear over time with the appointment of new judges,” according to an analysis of the legislation.

The constitution would be amended to include the following: “Provides that, to enshrine truths that are deeply rooted in this nation’s history and traditions, the people of Texas hereby affirm that a parent has the responsibility to nurture and protect the parent’s child and the corresponding fundamental right to exercise care, custody, and control of the parent’s child, including the right to make decisions concerning the child’s upbringing.”

Some questions were raised during legislative discussions about how the proposal would ensure children’s voices are also heard. — María Méndez

Proposition 16 (SJR 37): Clarifying citizenship requirement for voters

The ballot language: “The constitutional amendment clarifying that a voter must be a United States citizen.”

What it means: This amendment would add language to the Texas Constitution to explicitly say that “persons who are not citizens of the United States” cannot vote in the state. Though U.S. citizenship is already required to register to vote in Texas, this amendment aims to prevent local governments in Texas from allowing local residents who are not citizens to vote in local elections and comes in response to other states passing such policies, according to analysis of the legislation.

Critics of the measure said it is redundant and unnecessary. — María Méndez

Proposition 17 (HJR 34): Property tax exemption for border security infrastructure

The ballot language: “The constitutional amendment to authorize the legislature to provide for an exemption from ad valorem taxation of the amount of the market value of real property located in a county that borders the United Mexican States that arises from the installation or construction on the property of border security infrastructure and related improvements.”

What it means: This proposal and accompanying legislation would allow the state to prevent property value in border counties from increasing due to border security infrastructure and related improvements.

This new exemption could reduce local tax revenue, but costs to the state to help address school district losses are not expected to be significant, according to a fiscal note. Other local governments may have to raise tax rates to offset the losses, according to the fiscal note.

Proponents of the measure say this will address concerns that border security infrastructure added to private land by the state could increase that property’s appraisal and burden on property owners, according to the House Research Organization. Critics have said the state should not incentivize more border security infrastructure on private land and that the change could shift the tax burden to other local property owners. — María Méndez

On the other hand, the U.S. is grappling with whipsaw effects from slower-than-anticipated adoption, the loss of the $7,500 federal tax credit for EV purchases, implementation of tariffs on import vehicles and auto parts, and the rollback of emissions and other environmental standards.

If you're an auto investor who doesn't look fondly upon those developments, just wait a few minutes and it'll probably change, for better or worse. Here's the latest issue facing investors and the EV industry.

Profit-eroding incentives

With the federal $7,500 tax credit ending with the month of September, automakers trying to move EV inventory are digging into their own pockets to drive demand. General Motors (NYSE: GM) and Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) had previously found an intriguing loophole to use their finance arms to place down payments on EVs with intentions to pass that along to the consumer later. But both quickly ended those programs after pressure from politicians claimed the workarounds were ""nefarious."" Now the two Detroit auto icons are offering competitive lease payments and other costly incentives to make EV purchases compelling.

Hyundai Motor decided to push a $7,500 cash incentive on its 2025 Ioniq 5 for October, while also cutting the small crossover's price by nearly $10,000 for 2026. Similarly, Ford and GM's crosstown rival, Stellantis, began offering generous incentives to offset the loss of the federal tax credit immediately following its end. Those are just a handful of examples of how incentives are on the rise, but let's dig a little deeper as the issue spans the industry.

EV incentives peaked in July at 16% of average transaction prices (ATPs), according to Stephanie Valdez Streaty, Cox Automotive's director of industry insights, and at $8,900 during September the incentives remained above 15% of ATPs. That's more than twice the level for overall U.S. light vehicles that reached 7.4% in September, and still significantly above pre-pandemic levels that were typically around 10% of ATPs.

Unfortunately for automakers and investors alike, these profit-eroding incentives are a necessary evil due to the price gap between combustion engine vehicles and EVs. The average price for a new U.S. light vehicle was $47,962 in March 2025, according to Kelley Blue Book data cited by Experian, which remains near record highs. Meanwhile, the ATP for an EV in September reached $58,124, according to data from Cox.

What's the solution?

For automakers and investors, reducing these profit-killing incentives is important, and the arrival of truly affordable models is imperative. On that front, there's a bit of good news. One example is none other than General Motors' unveiling of the new Chevrolet Bolt.

The Chevy Bolt was released for the 2017 model year and was the automaker's first legitimate attempt at a modern EV. It was lauded as a great car in an ideal size and segment at a compelling price -- but due to an extended recall GM retired the vehicle in 2023 despite the Bolt posting its best sales year.

Now the Chevrolet Bolt is coming back in the early months of 2026 for round two.

The look and design of the two Bolts are very similar, especially viewing the exterior. The new Bolt offers about the same horsepower and will charge about three times faster than the previous generation. But the real kicker, especially for investors, is the price tag -- it ranges from $28,995 for the LT trim up to $32,000 for an RS trim, with an LT trim package between the two at $29,990. If you're keeping track, that makes the upcoming Bolt the cheapest EV announced across the U.S. market. The only problem is that currently the upcoming Bolt is allegedly only available for a limited time.

What it all means

While GM is preparing to launch the new Bolt at a compelling price point, the ever-changing EV industry dynamics aren't as pleasant for other automakers. That's true even for EV juggernaut Tesla, which has recently launched ""Standard"" and more affordable trims of its popular Model 3 and Model Y.

However, Tesla's strategy wasn't to start from the ground up for a truly compelling new affordable EV. Rather, the automaker opted to slash features and pinch pennies. All in all, Tesla was able to drop the Model Y Standard price down to $39,990 without shipping, about $5,000 less than the previous base price, and the Model 3 Standard down to $38,630, roughly $5,500 in savings. The problem is that due to the removal of features, the value proposition may not be compelling, and the lower-priced models could end up cannibalizing sales of more profitable trims and eroding margins themselves.

Further, for investors of pure-play EV makers such as Rivian and Lucid, the pain will be more drastic. These EV makers don't have a line of combustion engine vehicles to fall back on while the markets work through all the EV industry changes, policy rollbacks, and incentive spend.

The solution is as it's always been: produce a compelling EV at a comparable price to combustion engine counterparts. But the industry simply isn't quite there yet. Long-term investors would be wise to prepare for a few bumpy quarters and more hefty EV losses while incentives and high costs take a toll. The future is bright, but patience is required.

I've written recently about how all of these companies will lose a critical profit source in 2026. Automotive regulatory credits -- which previously brought in billions in ""free"" profit industrywide -- now have essentially zero value due to regulatory changes. But there's another challenge that Rivian, Lucid, and Tesla will soon face that could be even more damaging.

Demand for electric vehicles could be ""dreadful"" in 2026

According to research published in The New York Times, electric vehicle sales are expected to be ""dreadful"" next year. The demise won't wait until 2026 to begin, however. ""Sales of electric models are expected to plummet in the last three months of the year and then remain sluggish for some time,"" the article concludes.

The primary cause is clear: Earlier this year, the U.S. government eliminated tax credits for EV purchases. Because the tax credits expired at the end of September, many consumers raced to buy their vehicles before the deadline in order to lock in their financial incentives.

Previously, tax credits effectively reduced the cost of buying an EV by up to $7,500. A $55,000 vehicle, therefore, would essentially cost just $47,500. That's a big deal. Recent polling suggests that nearly 70% of American consumers want their next car to cost under $50,000.

When tax credits and other subsidies were reduced or eliminated in other countries, demand promptly fell off a cliff. That was the case for Germany in 2023, as well as Canada in 2025. Much of this demand slump will simply be due to a lumpy order book. Buyers who would have purchased in January 2026, for instance, may have accelerated their purchase to September 2025.

Investors should, therefore, be very skeptical about improving demand figures posted this upcoming quarter. The quarter that follows may, as the New York Times warns, generate ""dreadful"" sales growth rates.

Don't give up on Rivian, Tesla, or Lucid just yet

EV makers like Rivian, Tesla, and Lucid may have a rocky few quarters ahead. But that doesn't mean investors should ditch these stocks en masse. Long term, EV adoption is still expected to rise.

You may, however, want to conduct some asset reallocation based on this information. The company that will arguably be hit the least when it comes to eliminated tax credits for EV purchases is Tesla. It may see pressure on sales growth, but it has reliable access to capital. This will allow it to continue to invest in high-growth opportunities like robotaxis, as well as push to get a long-awaited $30,000 model to market. At that price point, these models will likely be cheap enough to see robust demand despite the absence of federal tax credits.

Rivian, meanwhile, is set to get its first affordable model to market: the R2. Two cheaper models -- the R3 and R3X -- are set to follow the R2, which is expected to begin production early next year. The R2 is expected to debut at $45,000. Even without incentives, that's below the $50,000 price point most buyers are targeting.

Lucid faces the most difficult road. The company has teased more affordable models for years, but the most aggressive timeline calls for production to begin by December 2026. Due to financial constraints and ancillary investment in other opportunities like robotaxis, it may take several more years to bring more affordable models to market. In a world where buyers are increasingly cost conscious, Lucid may struggle in a competitive landscape bereft of tax credits.

EV makers face a difficult road ahead. But opportunities remain. Instead of ditching the industry altogether, investors may be wise to simply reallocate their bets to the companies best positioned to succeed in new conditions.",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/835956/gettyimages-175165308-1201x802-c248ac3.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 04:58:30.924952

Profit-eroding incentives

With the federal $7,500 tax credit ending with the month of September, automakers trying to move EV inventory are digging into their own pockets to drive demand. General Motors (NYSE: GM) and Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) had previously found an intriguing loophole to use their finance arms to place down payments on EVs with intentions to pass that along to the consumer later. But both quickly ended those programs after pressure from politicians claimed the workarounds were ""nefarious."" Now the two Detroit auto icons are offering competitive lease payments and other costly incentives to make EV purchases compelling.

Hyundai Motor decided to push a $7,500 cash incentive on its 2025 Ioniq 5 for October, while also cutting the small crossover's price by nearly $10,000 for 2026. Similarly, Ford and GM's crosstown rival, Stellantis, began offering generous incentives to offset the loss of the federal tax credit immediately following its end. Those are just a handful of examples of how incentives are on the rise, but let's dig a little deeper as the issue spans the industry.

EV incentives peaked in July at 16% of average transaction prices (ATPs), according to Stephanie Valdez Streaty, Cox Automotive's director of industry insights, and at $8,900 during September the incentives remained above 15% of ATPs. That's more than twice the level for overall U.S. light vehicles that reached 7.4% in September, and still significantly above pre-pandemic levels that were typically around 10% of ATPs.

Unfortunately for automakers and investors alike, these profit-eroding incentives are a necessary evil due to the price gap between combustion engine vehicles and EVs. The average price for a new U.S. light vehicle was $47,962 in March 2025, according to Kelley Blue Book data cited by Experian, which remains near record highs. Meanwhile, the ATP for an EV in September reached $58,124, according to data from Cox.

What's the solution?

For automakers and investors, reducing these profit-killing incentives is important, and the arrival of truly affordable models is imperative. On that front, there's a bit of good news. One example is none other than General Motors' unveiling of the new Chevrolet Bolt.

The Chevy Bolt was released for the 2017 model year and was the automaker's first legitimate attempt at a modern EV. It was lauded as a great car in an ideal size and segment at a compelling price -- but due to an extended recall GM retired the vehicle in 2023 despite the Bolt posting its best sales year.

Now the Chevrolet Bolt is coming back in the early months of 2026 for round two.

The look and design of the two Bolts are very similar, especially viewing the exterior. The new Bolt offers about the same horsepower and will charge about three times faster than the previous generation. But the real kicker, especially for investors, is the price tag -- it ranges from $28,995 for the LT trim up to $32,000 for an RS trim, with an LT trim package between the two at $29,990. If you're keeping track, that makes the upcoming Bolt the cheapest EV announced across the U.S. market. The only problem is that currently the upcoming Bolt is allegedly only available for a limited time.

What it all means

While GM is preparing to launch the new Bolt at a compelling price point, the ever-changing EV industry dynamics aren't as pleasant for other automakers. That's true even for EV juggernaut Tesla, which has recently launched ""Standard"" and more affordable trims of its popular Model 3 and Model Y.

However, Tesla's strategy wasn't to start from the ground up for a truly compelling new affordable EV. Rather, the automaker opted to slash features and pinch pennies. All in all, Tesla was able to drop the Model Y Standard price down to $39,990 without shipping, about $5,000 less than the previous base price, and the Model 3 Standard down to $38,630, roughly $5,500 in savings. The problem is that due to the removal of features, the value proposition may not be compelling, and the lower-priced models could end up cannibalizing sales of more profitable trims and eroding margins themselves.

Further, for investors of pure-play EV makers such as Rivian and Lucid, the pain will be more drastic. These EV makers don't have a line of combustion engine vehicles to fall back on while the markets work through all the EV industry changes, policy rollbacks, and incentive spend.

The solution is as it's always been: produce a compelling EV at a comparable price to combustion engine counterparts. But the industry simply isn't quite there yet. Long-term investors would be wise to prepare for a few bumpy quarters and more hefty EV losses while incentives and high costs take a toll. The future is bright, but patience is required.

For months, the US – which walked out of the April talks – put pressure on other countries to reject the move.
In the final tally, 57 countries voted favour of delay, with 49 countries against delaying, and 21 abstentions.
Experts estimate the carbon levy as planned could raise $10bn a year, but to the disappointment of many small countries most of any potential revenues would remain within the shipping industry.
Shipping represents about 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, but that is forecast to rise to 10% by mid-century.","Under intense pressure from Donald Trump’s government, countries have postponed plans to force shipowners to start paying for the damage they do to the climate.

US officials were accused of “bullying” and “intimidation”, as nations met in London for what should have been the rubber-stamping of a decision made months ago to place a small levy on the greenhouse gases from global shipping.

Instead, after four days of intense wrangling, the US efforts appeared to pay off in a decisive vote late on Friday afternoon at the International Maritime Organisation headquarters in London.

A majority of countries present voted to put the plans for an emissions pricing mechanism on hold for a year. While this means the measure survives, and could still be imposed, it also gives the US and its allies – including Russia, Saudi Arabia and other petrostates – an opportunity to step up their pressure on other countries to ditch the charge.

Arsenio Dominguez, the IMO secretary general, said the outcome was not a cause for celebration. Taking aim at the fractious nature of the discussions, he chided delegates: “It is the time to really look back at how we have approached this meeting. My plea to you is not to repeat the way we have approached this meeting for future discussions.”

The measure, which would mean shipowners pay a small charge on the CO2 produced by their vessels and have incentives to seek cleaner fuels and upgrade their ships, was passed in a majority vote in April. But under the complex rules of the world’s shipping regulator, that vote had to be reaffirmed at a further meeting this week.

For months, the US – which walked out of the April talks – put pressure on other countries to reject the move. In the past fortnight, this was stepped up to what some countries said amounted to an unprecedented campaign against them.

The US threatened countries, and individual officials, with tariffs, penalties and visa revocations if they supported the pricing mechanism.

Dr Simon Bullock, a research fellow at the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at the University of Manchester, said: “Yet again, powerful fossil fuel states are successfully blocking global efforts to cooperate on climate change. This is not the result the industry wanted, nor one the world’s people can afford. Progressive shipping businesses and nations can still chart a course to a clean shipping future, but Mr Trump’s aggressive, destructive lobbying has their made their job much harder.”

Meanwhile, some petrostates including Saudi Arabia held out the offer of sweeteners to countries that voted against the plan, which has been several years in the making.

In the final tally, 57 countries voted favour of delay, with 49 countries against delaying, and 21 abstentions. In April, the measure had passed with the support of 63 member states and 16 countries against, though the US walked out and 24 countries abstained.

Ralph Regenvanu, Vanuatu’s climate minister, expressed the frustration of many small developing nations: “This is unacceptable given the urgency we face in light of accelerating climate change.”

After Friday’s vote, countries will have to reconvene in a year to consider the proposal again. The delay means uncertainty and confusion for companies involved in shipping and in the global trade in many key commodities.

John Maggs, of the Clean Shipping Coalition, said: “By delaying adoption of its net zero framework, the IMO has today squandered an important opportunity to tackle global shipping’s contribution to climate breakdown. With climate warming impacts being felt everywhere on earth, kicking this decision down the road is simply evading reality. Governments serious about climate action must spend the next 12 months rallying every nation that supports the framework, convincing those who are on the fence, or opposing, that its adoption is the only sane way forward.”

Even if the measure is agreed next year, it will take years to come into force, as IMO rules mean it must be subject to a further period of technical assessment and review of how it can be implemented. That could mean a delay until near the end of this decade, at least.

Experts estimate the carbon levy as planned could raise $10bn a year, but to the disappointment of many small countries most of any potential revenues would remain within the shipping industry. Much of the money would be used to help companies upgrade their vessels and move to lower carbon fuels, and pay for modifications to ports, rather than be allocated to poor countries to help them cope with the impacts of the climate crisis, as many had hoped.

If it is eventually passed, the measure is not likely to place significant costs on imported goods, despite the concerns of some exporting countries.

Shipping represents about 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, but that is forecast to rise to 10% by mid-century. The IMO has been working on various plans to reduce carbon from shipping for the last two decades, but progress has been slow.

The extraordinary scenes at the IMO, where discussions are normally staid and highly technical, bodes ill for further talks on ways to raise the revenues needed for poor countries to deal with the impacts of extreme weather, which will be continued at the Cop30 UN climate summit in Brazil next month.

Anaïs Rios, senior shipping policy officer at the green campaigning organisation Seas at Risk, said: “Emotions have run high this week at the IMO, with once high-ambitious alliances wavering and strategies eclipsing reason. No single flag should dictate the world’s climate course. With countries like Saudi Arabia leading efforts to delay, few expected a postponement to prevail, but here we are. What matters now is that countries rise up and come back to the IMO with a louder and more confident yes vote that cannot be silenced. The planet does not have time to waste.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf90cc0d9c43a7420259c6ee8c74714f74e80733/457_0_4551_3640/master/4551.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0f3841056d8b21364e245225234d7a78",N,,2025-10-18 05:59:03.943342

Wright said tech companies operating large-scale data centers known as hyperscalers to power AI “really want to see nuclear happen,” and noted they’re investing in advancing nuclear technology.

He said the country is making rapid progress in nuclear fusion, although experts have said the technology will not solve energy problems until the end of the decade or in the early 2030’s.

President Donald Trump has signed executive orders this year intended to bring about a “nuclear renaissance,” and Wright used the same phrase Friday.

“Utah absolutely is going to be a key part of that,” he said.

Utah Republicans, including Gov. Spencer Cox, share the desire to develop nuclear technology in the state, passing legislation creating governing bodies to advance nuclear systems, appropriating $10 million to fund Cox’s nuclear energy regulations through Operation Gigawatt, and making deals with nuclear innovators.

Cox has said he envisions the state as a home to dozens of small modular reactors. In the last six months, the state has signed an agreement with a company owned by Bill Gates to explore a Utah site for a new nuclear reactor and announced a partnership with another firm to bring an advanced reactor to Emery County.

Asked if the Emery County project will get off the ground, Curtis told reporters at his conference Friday, “I don’t think we have a choice of it being a reality, the demands for energy are so high, we have to figure this out.

Carmen Valdez, senior policy associate with HEAL Utah, said she has concerns about possible radiation exposure in communities near nuclear facilities, along with the years that could lapse between public investment and the day a reactor’s up and running.

“We are a little concerned about hearing ‘making nuclear sexy again,’ because there’s a lot of not great things that come with that industry that are just being brushed aside,” Valdez said.

Wright emphasized the plan to raise the nation’s energy output includes keeping coal-fired power plants running.

“I’m also super excited about next-generation geothermal, and frankly, Utah is the leader in that,” he said, referencing an enhanced geothermal plant being built in Beaver County.

She argued that AES Indiana can’t control much of the increase it seeks.
AES Indiana hopes regulators will finalize the case in the spring, so that it can implement new rates by June 1, 2026.
Correction: An earlier version of this article mistakenly described AES Indiana’s original base rate request as being for $293 million.","AES Indiana slashed its $193-million base rate increase request by more than half — to $91 million — in a settlement agreement filed with state regulators on Wednesday.

“We have a deep commitment to operating efficiently and keeping rates as low as possible,” utility President Brandi Davis-Handy said in a news release. “Throughout this process, we’ve listened to stakeholder feedback and evaluated tradeoffs we will make for future investments while minimizing the financial impact of delivering safe and reliable electric service.”

The proposed deal is with Indiana University and the city of Indianapolis, plus a variety of companies: Allison Transmission, Eli Lilly & Co., Rolls-Royce, Walmart and more. Kroger wasn’t part of the deal but has no objection to it, according to the filing.

The matter is before the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, and won’t be decided until next year.

Indiana Utility Consumer Counselor Abby Gray and her office, as well as pro-ratepayer group Citizens Action Coalition, didn’t sign on.

“The settlement agreement filed by AES and other parties shows the utility’s initial request was inflated and unnecessary,” Gray said in a Thursday news release. “The OUCC stands by its initial recommendations for a reduction from current rates and will oppose the utility’s settlement agreement.”

State’s ratepayer advocate recommends denial of AES’ $200M proposed increase

Her office recommended last month that the IURC deny AES Indiana’s request — and, instead, said a $21 million cut to current rates is “warranted” based on the case‘s evidence and the law.

Citizens Action Coalition, meanwhile, called the proposal “unbalanced.”

“We will vigorously oppose this unfair and unaffordable deal and do everything we can to protect the residents of Indianapolis from yet another large utility bill increase,” Executive Director Kerwin Olson said in a Thursday news release. “Hoosiers have had enough with AES Indiana’s poor service, soaring bills, and backroom deals. It’s time for the IURC to send a message and restore affordability and accountability at our out-of-control monopoly utilities.”

The proposed settlement

AES Indiana provides retail electric service to more than 530,000 residential, commercial and industrial customers in Indianapolis, as well as portions of other central Indiana communities surrounding Marion County

The agreement would lower the revenue requirement AES Indiana seeks from $2.1 billion to $2 billion, and lists other changes — to the cost of capital, fuel oil inventory, depreciation, vegetation management and more — that go into the revenue figure.

The utility also agreed not to implement new base rates arising out of its next case until 2030, after the current base rate request is carried out.

And the company would delay the start of its next proposed transmission, distribution and storage improvement charge plan until 2028. The current plan enters its final year in 2026.

“For over a decade, AES Indiana has consistently ranked among the lowest residential rates in the state, and that’s not by chance,” Davis-Handy said. “Despite rising costs, we have been disciplined in our planning through measures like our operations and maintenance costs holding flat for the past five years.”

Some of the agreement’s terms affect specific parties, like streetlight provisions involving the city of Indianapolis or discussions about “ways to ameliorate the peaks associated with Rolls-Royce’s engine testing.”

Story continues below.

The document goes on to tackle the cost of service and rate design.

“The Settling Parties agree that rates should be designed in order to allocate the revenue requirement to and among AES Indiana’s customer classes in a fair and reasonable manner,” it reads.

The subsidy received by residential customers would be “mitigated” by 15%, according to the agreement. Fixed charges would stay at their current, regulator-approved levels: $12.50 monthly at 325 kilowatt hours or less, and $17 monthly for residents using more power.

Large secondary service customers would pay a $128 charge and a demand charge of $28.50.

Citizens Action Coalition said the deal would result in residential customers receiving a 6.51% base rate increase, whereas primary and secondary classes of large commercial and industrial customers would “only” receive a 3.19% and 4.12% increase, respectively.

The advocacy organization also critiqued the arrangement for “fail(ing) to adequately address” the “egregious and prolonged” problems tens of thousands of customers experienced after AES rolled out a new billing system in 2023.

Regulators can approve, deny, or modify any settlement agreement they consider. But the document says that — if the IURC doesn’t accept the proposed deal in its entirety — it’ll be null, void and withdrawn upon written notice of “unacceptable modifications” by any of the settling parties.

Data centers not part of the equation

AES Indiana also filed rebuttals this month to earlier criticisms.

In their response to the initial increase ask, OUCC witnesses labeled the utility “inattentive” and “indifferent” when it comes to affordability.

“While the OUCC may disagree with the Company on policy matters, the suggestion that differing viewpoints constitute wrongdoing should be rejected,” Davis-Handy said in her rebuttal.

She argued that AES Indiana can’t control much of the increase it seeks.

“Rate reviews are driven by facts and require sound analysis,” Davis-Handy said. “This is necessary because the price charged for retail electric service is underpinned by the cost incurred to provide the service, and the reality is that much of the cost incurred by the Company to provide service is outside the Company’s control.”

She pointed to the utility’s “relatively flat” non-fuel, non-labor operations and management expenses as proof of “reasonable and sound management of costs that are under the Company’s control.”

Davis-Handy also rejected claims that power-hungry data centers are behind the rate increase request, testifying that AES Indiana doesn’t have any data center customers right now and that data center load is “in no way associated with” the proposed hike.

The OUCC pledged to submit opposition testimony “on a future date to be determined.” The settlement agreement includes a request to change the case’s filing schedule, but notes the “non-settling parties” haven’t agreed to the revisions.

Parties will have the opportunity to file testimony in support or opposition to the deal, after which the IURC will hold an evidentiary hearing.

AES Indiana hopes regulators will finalize the case in the spring, so that it can implement new rates by June 1, 2026.

Comprehensive Wrap-up: A Growth Story with Nuances In summary, Louisiana Pacific Corporation (NYSE: LPX) presents a compelling, albeit nuanced, growth story within the building materials industry.","Nashville, TN – As the North American housing market continues to navigate complex economic currents, investors are keenly assessing the long-term growth prospects of key players in the building materials sector. Among them, Louisiana Pacific Corporation (NYSE: LPX), a leading manufacturer of high-performance building materials and engineered wood products, stands at a critical juncture. With its stock currently trading around the low $90s as of mid-October 2025, the central question for many is whether LPX possesses the fundamental strength and market catalysts to double its share price within the next five years. This article delves into the company's current performance, strategic initiatives, market dynamics, and expert forecasts to provide a comprehensive outlook on its potential trajectory.

A Deep Dive into LPX's Growth Engine and Market Headwinds

Louisiana Pacific Corporation's business model is anchored by two primary segments: its highly successful Siding Solutions (including SmartSide and ExpertFinish products) and its Oriented Strand Board (OSB) offerings. As of October 2025, the company's strategy is heavily skewed towards capitalizing on the robust demand for its Siding products, which are lauded for their energy efficiency, weather resistance, and design flexibility. The anticipated above-market volume growth in the SmartSide business, fueled by successful new product developments and enhanced brand visibility, is a significant driver of LPX's positive long-term outlook. Notably, sales of its ExpertFinish products have demonstrated a strong 20% year-over-year growth, indicating expanding market share among repair and remodel contractors, further solidified by a strategic partnership with homebuilder Lennar. Improvements in pre-finishing efficiencies are also expected to bolster profitability within this segment.

Financially, LPX reported diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.99 for the Second Quarter of 2025, surpassing consensus estimates, despite a 7.2% year-over-year decline in quarterly revenue to $755 million. The divergence in segment performance is stark: Siding net sales surged by $45 million (11%) to $460 million, while OSB net sales plummeted by $101 million to $250 million. This trend is expected to continue into Q3 2025, with Siding net sales projected at $430 million (3% year-over-year growth) and a healthy Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $110 million. Conversely, the OSB segment is forecasted to record a negative Adjusted EBITDA of around $45 million, highlighting ongoing challenges in this commodity-driven business. For the full year 2025, LPX anticipates Siding net sales of approximately $1.7 billion (9% growth) with a robust 25% Adjusted EBITDA margin, while OSB is expected to remain in negative Adjusted EBITDA territory. The company plans significant capital expenditures of around $350 million for the year, signaling continued investment in its growth initiatives.

However, LPX's journey is not without considerable risks. Its substantial exposure to the cyclical North American housing market makes it vulnerable to economic downturns, which could lead to decreased demand and pricing pressure for its products. Volatility in energy and freight costs also poses a threat to earnings. Investor concerns are further compounded by competitor commentary hinting at potential volume declines due to inventory destocking, drawing parallels to the negative market performance observed in 2022 and 2023. As of mid-October 2025, LPX's stock has traded between $90.26 and $93.02, having delivered a -15.0% total return over the past 12 months. While short-term technical indicators show mixed signals, a ""Golden Star Signal"" issued in July 2025 on the long-term chart suggests potential for future gains. Insider sentiment is neutral, though hedge funds own a significant 94.73% of the stock, with recent purchases indicating increased institutional interest.

The Competitive Landscape: Winners and Losers in LPX's Shadow

The potential for Louisiana Pacific (NYSE: LPX) to achieve significant growth, possibly doubling its stock value, would undoubtedly send ripples through the competitive and interconnected building materials industry. LPX's primary competitors include giants like Weyerhaeuser (NYSE: WY), Boise Cascade (NYSE: BCC), West Fraser Timber (NYSE: WFG), and smaller specialized manufacturers.

If LPX's Siding Solutions continue their strong growth trajectory and gain substantial market share, competitors offering similar exterior building products could face increased pressure. Companies heavily invested in traditional siding materials or those without LPX's innovative product lineup might see their market positions erode. LPX's strategic partnership with Lennar, one of the nation's largest homebuilders, also gives it a competitive edge, potentially diverting business from other suppliers to Lennar and other homebuilders. Conversely, if LPX's OSB segment struggles to recover profitability, it might open opportunities for competitors like Weyerhaeuser and West Fraser Timber, which also have significant OSB operations, to gain market share or improve their margins in that specific product category.

Beyond direct competitors, related industries would also feel the effects. Homebuilders, for instance, could benefit from LPX's innovations, potentially leading to more cost-effective or aesthetically pleasing construction options, thereby enhancing their own offerings. Suppliers of raw materials to LPX could see increased demand, while those supplying competing manufacturers might experience stagnation. The entire ecosystem of contractors, distributors, and retailers dealing in building materials would need to adapt to LPX's market movements, potentially favoring its products if its growth continues. The dynamic interplay of product innovation, market share shifts, and raw material costs will dictate who ultimately wins or loses in the wake of LPX's future performance.

Broader Industry Trends and Historical Context

Louisiana Pacific's growth potential is inextricably linked to broader industry trends, particularly the health of the North American housing market. Factors such as housing starts, mortgage interest rates, and the availability of affordable housing significantly influence demand for building materials. As of October 2025, the market is grappling with fluctuating interest rates and persistent supply chain challenges, creating a complex environment for homebuilders and material suppliers alike. LPX's strong emphasis on its Siding Solutions, which cater to both new construction and the robust repair and remodel (R&R) market, positions it strategically to weather some of the volatility in new housing starts. The R&R segment tends to be more resilient during housing market slowdowns, offering a degree of insulation.

The push towards sustainable building practices and energy-efficient materials also plays directly into LPX's strengths. Products like SmartSide are often marketed with environmental benefits and durability, aligning with evolving consumer preferences and stricter building codes. This trend could create ripple effects, encouraging competitors to invest more in similar eco-friendly innovations or risk being left behind. Regulatory or policy changes related to forestry, carbon emissions, or construction standards could also significantly impact LPX and its peers. For instance, increased regulations on timber harvesting could drive up raw material costs, while incentives for green building could boost demand for LPX's specific product lines.

Historically, the building materials sector has been cyclical, closely mirroring economic cycles. Companies that have successfully navigated these cycles and achieved substantial long-term growth have often done so through strategic diversification, continuous innovation, and efficient cost management. The early 2000s saw a boom in housing, followed by a significant downturn, demonstrating the sector's sensitivity. Companies that emerged stronger focused on high-value products and operational resilience. LPX's current strategy of prioritizing its higher-margin Siding segment over the more commodity-driven OSB segment reflects an adaptation to these historical lessons, aiming to build a more stable and profitable business model less susceptible to the extreme swings of raw material prices.

What Comes Next: Navigating Opportunities and Challenges

Looking ahead, Louisiana Pacific (NYSE: LPX) faces a pivotal period that will determine its ability to achieve significant stock appreciation. In the short term, investors will be closely watching the company's Third Quarter 2025 earnings release on November 5, 2025. The performance of the Siding segment, particularly its ability to meet or exceed projected sales and Adjusted EBITDA, will be crucial. Any signs of stabilization or improvement in the OSB segment, even if it remains in negative EBITDA, could also be viewed positively. Beyond earnings, macroeconomic indicators such as housing starts, existing home sales, and interest rate decisions from the Federal Reserve will heavily influence market sentiment towards LPX and the broader building materials sector.

In the long term, LPX's strategic pivots will be key. Continued investment in research and development to expand its Siding Solutions product portfolio, coupled with aggressive market penetration strategies, will be essential. The partnership with Lennar is a strong foundation, but securing similar relationships with other major homebuilders could significantly accelerate growth. Operational efficiency improvements, particularly in pre-finishing processes for Siding, will be vital for margin expansion. Furthermore, exploring opportunities for international expansion or diversification into related, less cyclical building material niches could provide additional avenues for growth and risk mitigation. Potential strategic acquisitions that complement its Siding business or enhance its technological capabilities cannot be ruled out.

Several scenarios could unfold for LPX. In an optimistic scenario, a rebound in the North American housing market, coupled with sustained demand for its innovative Siding products and effective cost management, could propel the stock towards doubling its value within five years. Forecasts from Walletinvestor.com, predicting LPX to reach $149.695 by October 2030 (a 65.57% increase), and StockScan, forecasting an average price of $125.23 by 2030, suggest such a possibility, though the ""doubling"" target implies a more aggressive growth rate than these specific forecasts. A more conservative scenario might see steady but moderate growth, driven by the R&R market, but constrained by persistent housing market headwinds and OSB segment challenges. A pessimistic outlook would involve a prolonged housing downturn, significant increases in input costs, and a failure to effectively expand its Siding market share, leading to stagnation or decline.

Comprehensive Wrap-up: A Growth Story with Nuances

In summary, Louisiana Pacific Corporation (NYSE: LPX) presents a compelling, albeit nuanced, growth story within the building materials industry. The company's strategic focus on its high-growth, high-margin Siding Solutions business, particularly SmartSide and ExpertFinish, is a clear differentiator and the primary engine for future appreciation. Strong year-over-year growth in ExpertFinish sales, coupled with strategic partnerships and efficiency gains, underscore the segment's potential. However, the persistent drag from its commodity-driven OSB segment and the inherent cyclicality of the North American housing market remain significant headwinds that investors must carefully consider.

Moving forward, the market will closely scrutinize LPX's ability to continue expanding its Siding market share, innovate its product offerings, and manage operational costs effectively. While analyst sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with an average ""Hold"" rating and price targets suggesting a decent upside, achieving a doubling of the stock price within five years will require not only sustained execution on its Siding strategy but also a favorable macroeconomic environment, particularly a resilient or recovering housing sector. The substantial ownership by hedge funds indicates institutional confidence, but insider selling activity provides a mixed signal.

Investors should watch for upcoming earnings reports, paying close attention to Siding segment growth metrics and any signs of improvement or further deterioration in the OSB business. Furthermore, monitoring broader economic indicators such as housing starts, interest rate trends, and consumer spending on home improvements will provide critical context for LPX's performance. The company's capital allocation decisions, including share repurchases and investments in growth projects, will also be important indicators of management's confidence and strategic direction. While the path to doubling its stock value is challenging, LPX's strong position in the resilient Siding market provides a foundation for substantial long-term growth, making it a stock to watch in the coming months and years.

1. Resilience of the lambs: Some US solar projects are farming much more than sunlight – Factor This

Farmers across the US have different opinions on how we should use US farmland for solar. Some want panels on their land for financial benefits, others want to preserve their land or uphold family traditions. Some farmers are open to having solar panels on their land if they can still produce crops or livestock under the infrastructure.

For example, Enel North America announced a partnership with the Texas Solar Sheep Company last year to deploy more than 6,000 sheep across eight Texas solar projects in the largest known solar grazing agreement. The total Enel solar flock has now grown to 13,000.

2. How mega batteries are unlocking an energy revolution – The Financial Times

Across California, mega batteries store excess power from renewable sources and dispatch it when demand peaks. In August 2020, a heat wave pushed the state’s grid to its limits and triggered rolling blackouts over two days, cutting power to more than 800,000 homes for up to two and a half hours, raising serious questions about dependence on intermittent renewable energy. But this is what started the boom in mega battery development. California’s battery storage capacity has more than tripled to 13GW of power, with plans for an additional 8.6GW by 2027.

A standard 20-foot storage unit typically delivers 5-6MWh, enough to power around 30,000 UK homes for an hour.

3. Trump administration quietly canceled the nation’s largest solar project – CNN

Esmeralda 7, the collection of seven solar projects in Nevada, was supposed to generate up to 6.2 GW of energy, enough to power 2 million homes. But last week, BLM quietly changed the project’s status to “canceled.” The Interior Department said the change was part of a shift in permitting approach, not related to the government shutdown, and not a “cancellation,” per se.

Developers can still apply for approval through individual project proposals, but the environmental review process is slow, and each project could still be rejected later.

4. Base Power, a Battery-Focused Power Company, Raises $1 Billion — The New York Times

A two-year-old Texas-based power company, Base Power, is leasing huge batteries to homeowners that it can use for extra energy as needed. Its software fills the batteries when electricity is cheap and draws from them when prices rise, profiting from the difference and passing some savings back to customers.

Since launching, Base Power has sold over 100 MWh of battery capacity, enough to power 33,000 US homes for one hour. A major factor in Base Power’s growth is Texas’s deregulated energy market, which lets customers pick their power providers. The company also recently qualified for a state program that lets battery fleets combine their power and feed it back into the grid.

5. The real winners of Trump’s attack on clean energy aren’t American — The Washington Post

While the Trump administration works to revive fossil fuels and roll back clean energy support, global economics are accelerating a renewable surge led by China and India. Other nations are rapidly adopting solar, wind, and EVs because they’re cheaper and more reliable, with China dominating clean tech manufacturing. U.S. policy reversals have stalled investments and risk sidelining the country economically, while global forecasts show renewables scaling faster than energy demand, diminishing fossil fuels’ role.",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/maxresdefault-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 11:03:08.296465

We are building data centers next to scenic, natural landscapes and in places people already call home.
If we lose that landscape to data centers, what will we have left?
But I have some questions before we build any more sites at the behest of big data, artificial intelligence and big business.
What environmental impact do these data centers have?","There is more than corn in Indiana. Now we are growing data centers. I don’t remember voting on this. No one asked my opinion before they started building these….so here it is.

There are already 72 large computing facilities in Indiana with more under construction or consideration. Indiana is turning valuable, irreplaceable farmland into sites for computer processing. We are building data centers next to scenic, natural landscapes and in places people already call home.

Our rural landscapes have always been part of the charm of living in Indiana. The farms, the small towns, the marshes and woodlands are what inspired T. C. Steele. If we lose that landscape to data centers, what will we have left? Are the environmental costs worth it just so Google can collect more data on me, Amazon can sell me more junk, and ChatGPT can do more thinking for me?

There are few issues that unite Hoosiers in these divided times. But maybe opposition to these new projects can bring us together. Whether you live in the city or on a farm, if you are Republican or Democrat, liberal or conservative, there doesn’t appear to be a lot of popular support for these new projects. In September, Google pulled the plug on a proposed data center in Franklin Township in Indianapolis—immediately before the Indianapolis City-County Council was going to vote on the project. The project was facing a united and stiff grassroots opposition from residents. The project would have permanently changed nearly 500 acres of farmland.

From what I’ve read, I do not want to live next to or near one of these big computing centers. They create light, noise, and air pollution. They use a tremendous amount of water and electricity. They drive down property values.

There are other drawbacks, too. Once completed, these facilities provide few permanent jobs. And some of those jobs are being replaced by robots and artificial intelligence. They also use an incredible amount of electricity. Our power infrastructure is already strained and in need of updating. I don’t know about you, but my electric bill is already high enough.

Maybe growing computer sites instead of corn is the wave of a new economic future. But I have some questions before we build any more sites at the behest of big data, artificial intelligence and big business. What environmental impact do these data centers have? How do they impact our health? Are they safe? How many jobs do they actually provide?

I am biased on this issue because I am from a farming family. The past of Indiana has been agriculture, and I think its future is also agriculture. We need to make sure that we have clean air, land and water to grow food. I don’t know if those in power are aware of this, but humans need food to survive. I also want an Indiana that is a healthy and safe place for us to live. We are the stewards of Indiana’s natural resources. That’s a role that our economic and political leaders need to take seriously. Once our natural resources are gone, once the landscape is destroyed, it’s just about impossible to bring back.

The vote was 167-19 in favor of the project, which will be funded thanks to New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) assistance.

Superintendent Dr. John O’Connor initially thought the project was “too good to be true”, but as the numbers lined up, the district moved forward with the proposal at no additional tax impact to district taxpayers. The cost of the project will be entirely covered thanks to a NYSERDA grant of $945,377, $100,000 in utility rebates, and roughly $6.4 million of New York State Building Aid.

The project consists of the installation of HVAC systems and mechanical upgrades throughout the district at a total cost of $7,466,977. New rooftop units will be installed at both schools to address heating, air conditioning, and air quality in classrooms, cafeterias, music rooms, and gymnasiums. Windows on the second and third floors of the Middle/High School will also be replaced to reduce energy loss, while electrical upgrades will improve efficiency, as well.

“This is an important step forward for our district as we continue to improve our facilities and energy efficiency,” O’Connor said.

The project received even more support than the initial capital project, which still passed by a sizable margin of 128-31. Between the two projects, the total amount of work surpasses $19 million, but no additional tax impact is required to fund the work.

The work is scheduled to begin at the end of the current school year and will result in more efficient heating and cooling systems throughout both schools.

“Stunned,” said Richard Herod III, who founded Car Guy Concierge to help people navigate buying and selling vehicles. “That news came after me realizing in the last 30 days, I’ve seen monumental shifts from carmakers to make cars more affordable.”

He pointed out a number of automakers are now offering low financing.

“You have import brands like Mitsubishi and Nissan offering zero percent APR and not just for three years, for five years, which is nuts,” said Herod. “Consumers can find a really good deal on a car when that hasn’t been the same for the last few years.”

He recommends car buyers ask about other discounts, including for service members, first responders and wholesale club members. According to Herod, it could save a buyer anywhere from $500 to $2,000, or more.

He also suggests analyzing potential tax savings while deciding whether to trade in an older vehicle or sell it on the marketplace.

“Trading the car in and saving the sales tax makes that worth doing rather than selling the car on their own,” said Herod. “If you can trade it and get a lower interest rate on a new car, you might end up with a payment that actually surprises you or makes you happy compared to a deal you could’ve gotten six months or 12 months ago.”

These improvements to the grid are intended to facilitate electricity transmission in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, and West Virginia. The initiative, which focuses on lines managed by American Electric Power (AEP), will not create new routes but will enhance the capacity of existing ones.

AEP ranks among the largest utility companies and transmission line operators in the country, with a presence in 11 states. The 5,000 miles set for upgrades account for about 13% of its entire network.

The loan guarantee was put forward by the Biden administration just before President Trump took office. In the past, the Trump administration has pointed to approvals made between Election Day and Inauguration Day as reasons for halting certain projects.

It remains uncertain why this particular grid upgrade was treated differently from other projects that the Trump administration is reviewing for cancellation or has already moved to cancel.

In Minnesota, the Department of Energy is working to withdraw a $467 million grant that would have enabled 28 gigawatts of new generation capacity, primarily from solar and wind sources. Another project in Oregon involved $250 million in grants to link several renewable energy initiatives.

However, the most significant transmission project targeted for cancellation by the Trump administration is a $630 million grant to update California’s grid. Much like the AEP effort, this project aims to maximize the existing grid’s capacity to reduce congestion. The California plan includes testing advanced conductors and dynamic line rating technology, both designed to increase the amount of electricity that can be carried along established routes—a solution often less costly than constructing new lines.

AEP’s project will also involve installing new conductors on the lines. The loan guarantee will help the company obtain loans at a lower interest rate, which is expected to save at least $275 million—savings the company says will be passed on to its customers.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright stated that the loan will “help ensure lower electricity prices throughout the Midwest.” The states included in the project already have some of the lowest power rates in the country.

The loans will be provided by the Loan Programs Office, which the GOP has renamed the Energy Dominance Financing Program. This office was created under the 2005 Energy Policy Act and has traditionally supported clean energy and manufacturing ventures. Its loan default rate is about 3%, significantly lower than that of private lenders.",,N,,2025-10-18 16:04:05.485895

The EDC report identifies strengths such as Canada’s comparative advantages in clean electricity and renewable energy equipment, its potential to lead in the EV battery sector, and expertise in developing technologies that help transition an economy from being powered by fossil fuels to electricity.

There are challenges for the cleantech sector, including as upended global trade, disrupted supply chains and the U.S. retreat on climate action.

But it also gets a boost from “a huge demand for energy driven by AI (artificial intelligence) and regional energy security,” Prerna Sharma, a senior economist at EDC, told Sustainable Biz Canada. She is the author of the EDC report titled Canada’s cleantech future: Scalable, profitable, essential.

Another problem is that the majority of Canada’s environmental and cleantech exports go to the U.S. (77 per cent in 2023), which is complicated by the ongoing trade war with the country. However, there is “lots of room for growth” in markets outside the U.S., Sharma added, such as Europe, Asia and South America.

“I don’t think we fully realize our potential when it comes to our cleantech and environmental exports,” she said.

Canada’s cleantech export strengths

Renewable energy’s prospects are bright, EDC assesses in the report. With ever-growing demand for electricity to power data centres that provide the computing for AI, renewables will be a strong option to provide the energy. For example, the costs for installing solar energy infrastructure have continued to nosedive, making it 56 per cent cheaper than the average cost of fossil fuel-powered alternatives in 2023.

Canada has opportunities in the export of cleantech, such as renewable electricity, air pollution and monitoring equipment, biofuels, green hydrogen fuel and heat pumps, EDC says.

The Crown corporation mapped out the country’s comparative export advantages compared to its peers in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. For example, Canada has the edge in biofuels, green hydrogen and wind energy compared to the U.S. Against South Korea, Canada leads on solar and wind energy, and waste management and recycling.

On the EV side, Canada has the “capacity to become a global powerhouse in battery manufacturing” and exporter of critical minerals, Sharma said. Factors that will help Canada reach that potential are:

the country’s abundant reserves of critical minerals such as lithium, copper and graphite;

the billions of dollars invested into EV battery manufacturing in Ontario and Quebec;

access to clean electricity for low-carbon production; and

Canada’s strong sustainability standards for mining.

Canada can be a “global leader” in electrification, the EDC report states. Canadian companies are adopting and developing technologies that help an economy transition from being powered by fossil fuels to electricity, such as heat pumps and electric arc furnaces.

Plus, Canada is deeply familiar with renewable electricity and is deploying innovations to manage intermittency such as flexible switching.

The country has “a lot of capacity and capability to transfer this wealth and knowledge and good electrification standards we have,” Sharma said.

Cleantech sector is growing despite stressors

EDC notes three factors that are harming investor sentiment for cleantech: limited funding, policy shifts such as reduced government support in the U.S. and elevated tariffs, and investors looking toward more commercially viable technologies.

While mindful of the hurdles, Sharma said global momentum toward low-carbon technologies has not stopped. Approximately US$2 trillion was invested in clean energy in 2024, more than double the money that went to fossil fuels, she said. Some cleantech subsectors, such as renewable energy, are becoming increasingly profitable, and can continue to be even more economically competitive.

In addition to Canada’s advantages in cleantech exports, the country has specialties such as a highly educated workforce, a strong research and development base, a healthy startup scene, and a federal government committed to the energy transition, Sharma explained.

Another major opportunity for Canada is the use of AI in cleantech. The topic of the EDC’s last report, Sharma said Canada has an opportunity to lead in applications like energy management, energy forecasting and grid planning.

“A good ecosystem that supports innovative startups and companies is really a recipe for success,” she said.",https://squall.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/posts/2025101416-edc-cleantech-export-400x300.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 09:03:43.442693

The company is establishing its North American headquarters in Calgary and plans to begin operations with its first natural gas plant in 2026, marking the foundation of an ambitious expansion strategy targeting 450MW+ of operational capacity across Alberta by 2031.

The Firm Power Crisis: AI's Infrastructure Bottleneck

The explosive growth of AI infrastructure has exposed a fundamental gap in North America's energy landscape—one that threatens to constrain the entire AI revolution. Recent research from Goldman Sachs' 2025 report ""Powering the AI Era"" reveals the scale of the challenge: by 2030, global data center power demand is projected to surge 160%, yet aging electrical grids cannot adapt quickly enough to meet this demand.

""Goldman's research confirms what we're hearing from every AI company and data center operator we speak with,"" said Kevin Capozzi, VP Operations at Radiant Ridge Energy. ""Power has become the most urgent bottleneck in AI infrastructure development. A 250MW AI data center costs approximately $12 billion to build, but that investment is worthless without firm, reliable power to run it.""

The challenge has created what industry analysts are calling AI's ""Rust Belt"" revolution—a fundamental shift in how and where compute infrastructure gets built, driven entirely by access to firm power capacity.

Three Dimensions of the Power Problem

The firm power crisis facing AI infrastructure has three critical dimensions:

Renewable Intermittency: Wind and solar provide cost-effective generation but cannot guarantee firm capacity. Goldman Sachs projects that new data center power demand will require 30% natural gas combined cycle, 30% natural gas peaker plants, 27.5% solar, and 12.5% wind—a recognition that renewables alone cannot deliver the firm, reliable power compute operations demand.

Grid Constraints and Aging Infrastructure: The US electrical grid averages 40 years old and was never designed for AI-scale power density. By 2027, AI server rack power density will be 50 times that of cloud servers from just five years ago. Traditional utility connections require 5-7 years for approval and construction—unacceptable timelines when hyperscalers like Amazon and Google are investing $1 trillion in AI infrastructure by 2027, averaging $800 million in daily capital expenditure.

Reliability Requirements: AI training runs can't pause when the wind stops blowing. Data centers can't go dark when clouds cover solar panels. These operations need firm, contracted power with absolute reliability. Goldman's research shows global data center vacancy rates at just 3%—near 0% in hot markets—with no significant new power capacity expected before 2028, creating a severe supply-demand imbalance.

""A single power interruption can cost millions in lost compute time,"" Capozzi explained. ""One ChatGPT query consumes approximately 10 times the electricity of a Google search. When you're running massive GPU clusters for AI training, you need firm power with guaranteed availability—not estimates, not best-effort, not weather-dependent generation.""

The RRE Solution: Hybrid Systems for Firm, Contracted Power

Radiant Ridge Energy solves the firm power problem through intelligent hybrid integration that delivers contracted, reliable capacity at compute-grade standards—precisely the energy mix Goldman Sachs identifies as necessary for meeting AI infrastructure demand.

""Our approach directly addresses the acute short-term power contradictions Goldman describes,"" Capozzi explained. ""Natural gas plants take 5-7 years to build. Renewable energy supply is intermittent. Nuclear is a long-term solution. This creates severe near-term supply-demand tensions. Our hybrid-by-design model solves this by integrating wind, solar, and natural gas into systems that guarantee firm power delivery today, not five years from now.""

The company's hybrid architecture provides three critical advantages for the AI power crisis:

Guaranteed Firm Capacity: Unlike pure renewable projects that offer ""best effort"" generation, RRE delivers contracted firm power backed by dispatchable natural gas. Wind and solar provide cost-effective baseload generation while natural gas ensures firm capacity and rapid response during high-demand periods or renewable lulls. When customers sign a power purchase agreement with RRE, they receive guaranteed capacity—firm, reliable power when they need it, not just when weather conditions cooperate.

Rapid Deployment: RRE's modular approach uses standardized 10MW facilities that can scale to 100MW+ clusters. This standardization dramatically accelerates deployment timelines, delivering firm power in 12-18 months rather than the 5-7 years traditional utility grid connections require. With Goldman projecting a 10.4GW US data center demand-supply gap by 2030, speed to firm power is critical.

Behind-the-Meter Flexibility: Goldman's research highlights the rise of ""behind-the-meter power""—self-built microgrids and direct power plant connections that bypass grid bottlenecks. RRE's hybrid systems are designed for both grid-connected and behind-the-meter deployment, providing AI operators the flexibility to secure firm power regardless of grid constraints.

""We're not promising theoretical capacity or best-effort generation,"" said Capozzi. ""We're delivering firm, contracted, reliable power backed by operational guarantees. That's the difference between a renewable project and a compute-grade power solution that can actually support AI infrastructure development.""

Alberta Operations and Growth Strategy

RRE's Alberta roadmap focuses on rapid deployment of firm power capacity to address the immediate supply-demand gap:

2025-2026: Company establishment and first 10MW natural gas plant operational; submission of 50MW gas + 50MW hybrid project providing firm, contracted capacity

2026-2027: Ten small power plants delivering reliable power under long-term contracts with data center customers

2028-2029: First full hybrid station operational, firm power delivery at scale

2030-2031: Multiple hybrid stations providing contracted firm power across Alberta, positioning for U.S. market expansion

""Every megawatt we build is firm capacity under contract,"" Capozzi noted. ""We're not selling intermittent generation—we're delivering reliable power that compute operations can depend on, with deployment timelines that match the urgency of AI infrastructure investment.""

Powering the Compute Economy with Firm, Reliable Energy

Radiant Ridge Energy focuses exclusively on delivering firm, contracted power for compute infrastructure—the critical bottleneck Goldman Sachs identifies as constraining AI development:

AI Training Facilities: GPU clusters running multi-week training operations cannot tolerate power interruptions. With AI server rack power density reaching 50 times traditional cloud servers by 2027, these facilities require firm, reliable power with contracted capacity guarantees that enable uninterrupted AI development.

Data Centers: Whether hyperscale cloud providers investing $1 trillion by 2027 or colocation facilities serving emerging AI companies, data centers need firm power with guaranteed availability. RRE's contracted capacity model provides the reliable power foundation these operations demand, with scalability that grows alongside IT infrastructure without waiting years for grid upgrades.

""Goldman's research shows that compute infrastructure has become the defining infrastructure challenge of our time—similar to railroads, electrification, and the internet,"" Capozzi emphasized. ""But unlike those previous revolutions, AI can't wait decades for infrastructure buildout. Our customers need firm, contracted, reliable power now—not estimates, not best-effort, not weather-dependent generation. They need guaranteed capacity they can build their business on. That's what we deliver.""

Why Alberta for Firm Power Development

Alberta's unique combination of resources positions it as an ideal solution to North America's AI power crisis:

""Alberta has world-class wind and solar resources, established natural gas infrastructure, and transmission capability to support hybrid integration,"" Capozzi explained. ""While Goldman's research shows the US facing a 10.4GW demand-supply gap by 2030, Alberta's competitive, market-driven energy sector rewards innovation in firm power delivery. We can build, contract, and deliver reliable power faster here than anywhere else in North America.""

The province's growing tech sector, strategic location, and business-friendly regulatory environment also position Alberta as a natural hub for AI infrastructure requiring firm, contracted power—offering an alternative to power-constrained markets in the US and overseas.

Partnership-Focused Approach

RRE offers multiple collaboration pathways centered on firm power delivery, aligned with the innovative financing models Goldman Sachs identifies as necessary for AI infrastructure development:

Power Purchase Agreements: Long-term contracts guaranteeing firm capacity with fixed pricing and reliable delivery, providing the contracted power security hyperscalers and AI companies require

Joint Development: Co-develop hybrid projects delivering contracted firm power for specific facilities or strategic locations, leveraging customer land holdings or grid connections

Strategic Investment: Equity partnerships providing access to firm power capacity and project economics, addressing Goldman's observation that traditional financing models are failing and innovative approaches are required

Supply Chain Partnerships: Standardized procurement supporting rapid deployment of reliable power infrastructure

""Goldman's research shows that by 2030, digital infrastructure will require $2 trillion in capital globally,"" said Capozzi. ""Every partnership we build is about delivering firm, contracted, reliable power that makes those investments productive. That's our singular focus and our competitive advantage.""

Proven Capability in Critical Infrastructure

While new to Alberta, Radiant Ridge Energy brings proven experience in mission-critical power systems, including a comprehensive national power system modernization initiative in Seychelles demonstrating the company's capability to deliver reliable power at scale.

""We understand what reliable power means,"" Capozzi said. ""Now we're bringing that operational excellence to Alberta's compute sector with firm, contracted capacity they can depend on—solving the most urgent bottleneck facing AI development today.""

Note: Because of the federal government shutdown that started on Oct. 1, 2025, government-provided estimates for the employment situation, inflation, wages, and other statistics were unavailable for this report. These values will be provided again once the data becomes available. Wherever possible, privately-provided estimates will be monitored instead.

Although the federal government shutdown prevented the release of key economic data, the available statistics pointed to mixed implications for the U.S. economy. The August Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey showed that hiring and job separations both declined by nearly the same amount, keeping job growth implied by the survey slightly positive. The September ADP jobs report, which gained importance in lieu of government-provided estimates, showed a decline of 32,000 private sector jobs. While this indicates a continued decline in jobs growth, it lacks perspective on broad labor market conditions without a read of the unemployment rate.

The government shutdown itself contributes to near-term risk of macroeconomic deceleration that expands with the duration of the shutdown. Moreover, the end of the federal deferred resignation period on Sept. 30, coupled with any additional layoffs in the federal government, could contribute to a jump in the unemployment rate and a corresponding decline in economic activity. Despite these downside factors, several indicators point to a macroeconomic improvement in the coming months. In particular, business survey data shows an improvement in the hiring outlook, which could cause the employment situation and economic activity to rebound.

In response to weakening labor markets, the Federal Reserve reduced its key short-term interest rate by 25 basis points during its September meeting. While this rate reduction was widely anticipated, further rate cuts remain uncertain. In reducing rates in September, the Fed prioritized labor market concerns over persistent inflation, which remains nearly a percentage point above the Fed’s 2 percent target. Mortgage rates and the 10-year Treasury yield both fell in September as borrowing costs fell across capital markets.

Stories We’re Following

Long-term Treasury Yields

The issue: Activity in the long-term Treasury security market offers insights into movements in mortgage rates. While short-term rates are affected by certain factors, including Fed interest rate changes, long-term rates are affected by the long-term macroeconomic outlook, the inflation outlook, and credit risk over the investment horizon. By studying the changes in long-term rates, along with the factors affecting long-term rates, we can understand how those individual factors might impact mortgage rates and other long-term rates.

Updates: Over the past few years, the spread between the 10-year and 30-year Treasury yields has been roughly 10-20 basis points. However, since April of 2025, the spread between these securities has risen sharply, nearly reaching 70 basis points in early September. Differences in inflation expectations implied by the inflation-protected Treasury securities do not account for this difference, leaving other factors, like credit risk, the long-term economic outlook, and other market forces to explain this increase.1 If federal credit risk is driving this increase in the yield spread, then this rise in credit risk is unlikely affecting mortgage rates because of the 10-year Treasury yield’s prominence as the benchmark for mortgage rates.

Federal Reserve Policy

The issue: The Fed is tasked with achieving a dual mandate of price stability and full employment. As inflation approaches the Fed’s 2 percent target, the central bank gains support for reducing interest rates to accommodate slowing labor markets. As part of its broader balance sheet operations, the Fed also buys and sells long-term private and public financial assets. Its divestment in mortgage-backed securities has placed upward pressure on mortgage rates, which could continue for as long as the Fed maintains this policy.

Updates: The Fed reduced its target short term rate by 25 basis points in response to a weakening U.S. labor market. Fed Chair Jerome Powell characterized the rate reduction as a risk management exercise, as the possibility of further deterioration in labor markets outweighs the upside risks to inflation. Meanwhile, the Fed left its balance sheet policy unchanged, which could sustain elevated long-term interest rates, relative to short-term interest rates.

Recession Likelihood

The issue: The onset of the global trade war and recent deceleration of the U.S. labor market created concerns that the economy may be entering into a recession. Recessions are broad declines in economic activity typically characterized by a decline in economic growth and a rise in unemployment. They are often triggered by a shock to the economy, such as the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Understanding the state of the economy and the nature of economic downturns provides insights into the near-term likelihood of recessions.

Updates: Although recessions can happen at any time, trends in the durations of economic expansions remain one of the best broad-based measures of recession likelihood. At 5.5 years, the current expansion’s duration would be short, relative to the trending increase in durations over time. A recession now would make the current expansion the shortest in over four decades. Moreover, although the unemployment rate has been slowly rising, economic growth remains elevated, contradicting the pattern typically seen during a recession. These factors show no clear indication that a recession is likely to happen in the coming months, although it’s certainly possible.

Notes: Expansions are measured from the end date of one recession to the start date of the next recession. The current expansion, which started in May 2020 (shown in green), is still ongoing.

Texas Economic Indicators

Although the availability of employment data was affected by the federal government shutdown, recent downward revisions to Texas employment show that the state-level economy may be operating at a rate closer to the national-level growth rate than previous estimates indicated. Survey data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas showed continued growth in the share of Texas retail and service sector firms expecting to increase employment. The hiring outlook in the Texas manufacturing sector, however, deteriorated, likely due to the decline in oil prices.

Employment Outlook

The share of Texas firms planning to hire in the next six months continued a strong rebound in the services and retail sectors, while declining in the manufacturing sector (Figure 6). This indicates a broad rebound in business optimism that could lead to a corresponding increase in job growth in the coming months. The number of firms planning to decrease employment rose sharply in the manufacturing sector, while ticking down in the retail sector and remaining mostly flat in the services sector. Overall, the business survey data appears to indicate a labor market improvement in the coming months in the services and retail sectors and a worsening labor market in manufacturing. This employment outlook survey remains a critical indicator of the labor market and economic trajectory.

Housing and Mortgage Rates

Mortgage rates continued falling in September but remained elevated, as rates declined 26 basis points from 6.56 percent to 6.30 percent (Figure 7). Broad-based housing cost measures across the U.S. continued showing deceleration in the housing market, as heightened mortgage rates and a sustained macroeconomic deceleration continue weighing on housing market activity.

As the Federal Reserve pivots to more accommodative policy in the coming months, short-term rates may continue to decline. Long-term rates on certain financial assets, including mortgages, may depend extensively on several factors, including the inflation outlook, the U.S. macroeconomic outlook, and the Fed’s balance sheet policy.

The mortgage spread (Figure 8)—defined as the premium of mortgage rates over the 10-year Treasury yield—continued to decline, falling 17 basis points in September, from 231 to 214 basis points (i.e., from 2.31 percentage points to 2.14 percentage points). The mortgage spread, which provides useful context of mortgage rates in broader capital markets, remains elevated compared to the historical range of 150-175 basis points. This suggests that as capital markets normalize, mortgage rates could decline by another 50 to 75 basis points, relative to the 10-year Treasury yield.

Notes: The mortgage spread is defined as the 30-year mortgage rate minus 10-year Treasury yield. Its typical range is 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent (150 to 175 basis points).

“We do not think India can stop Russian crude purchases overnight, even if it has agreed to do so, as at least 700,000 bpd of India imports of Russian crude are on a term basis,” consultancy FGE said in a note.
China could pick up some of the volumes backed out of India as Russian crude discounts will widen further, they added.
“The move has undoubtedly sounded an alarm for other Russian oil buyers who may have previously overlooked sanctions from non-U.S. authorities,” Xu said.
Anne-Sophie Corbeau, a researcher at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, said the U.S. needs to have a consistent and coherent policy on Russian LNG.","The moves come after Russia ramped up crude exports this month as Ukrainian drone attacks on its refineries have reduced oil processing. China and India’s seaborne imports of key Russian crude grades are expected to rebound to about 3.1 million barrels per day in October, the highest volume since June, data from analytics firm Kpler showed.

These imports are expected to remain high through November given the sharp rise in exports from Russia, Kpler’s senior oil analyst Muyu Xu said.

“However, the sudden UK sanctions on Chinese and Indian refineries — and the possibility of more measures from the EU or even the U.S. — could prompt buyers to take a more cautious approach when placing new orders until further clarification emerges,” she added.

INDIA CUTS NOT YET VISIBLE

A White House official said on Thursday that Indian refiners are already cutting Russian oil imports by 50%. Indian sources said the cut was not visible yet, though it could be reflected in import numbers for December or January. Refiners had already placed orders for November loading that included some cargoes for December arrival as well, multiple sources said.

“We do not think India can stop Russian crude purchases overnight, even if it has agreed to do so, as at least 700,000 bpd of India imports of Russian crude are on a term basis,” consultancy FGE said in a note.

“Therefore, the maximum volume of Russian crude flows to India we see as potentially being at risk in the short term is the 0.8-1 million bpd of spot volumes that Indian refiners take,” FGE analysts said. China could pick up some of the volumes backed out of India as Russian crude discounts will widen further, they added.

Meanwhile, Indian refiners have bought rare Guyanese crude as they diversify purchases that would mitigate the impact on their operations if Russian supply was cut.

SANCTIONS ON NAYARA, YULONG

Britain slapped sanctions on India’s Nayara refinery, which is already reeling from EU sanctions, and on Chinese refiner Yulong Petrochemical which operates a 400,000 barrels per day refinery in China’s eastern Shandong province.

The UK government has given Yulong until November 13 to complete outstanding transactions, allowing the refiner to handle its upcoming Middle Eastern imports, Kpler’s Xu said.

It’s unclear if Yulong can establish a new supply chain to circumvent the sanctions, she added.

“The move has undoubtedly sounded an alarm for other Russian oil buyers who may have previously overlooked sanctions from non-U.S. authorities,” Xu said.

June Goh, a senior oil market analyst at Sparta Commodities, said the UK sanctions are unlikely to significantly impact Yulong, but the refiner will find it hard to maintain operations if the EU and the U.S. follow suit.

Meanwhile, Taiwan’s Russian naphtha imports are set to fall after a group of non-governmental organisations criticised the island’s continued business with Russia.

However, Ukrainian attacks on Russian energy infrastructure, as well as a partial ban imposed by Moscow on Russian exports of gasoline and diesel, have already been capping Russian refined product shipments, traders said.

JAPAN LNG IMPORTS

The U.S. has also called on Japan to halt Russian energy imports, ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump’s expected visit to Asia later this month.

Tokyo has agreed with other G7 countries to phase out Russian oil imports in response to Moscow’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, but it has exemptions to continue importing LNG from the Sakhalin-2 project under long-term contracts.

An early termination of these contracts would result in various penalties, said Yuriy Humber, CEO of Tokyo-based consultancy Yuri Group. Also, securing an additional 6 million metric tons of LNG annually on the spot market to replace Russian supply would not be easy and is “massively expensive”, he said.

Russian LNG, which accounts for about 9% of Japanese imports, is an important stable supply source for Japan, Kingo Hayashi, chairman of Japan’s Federation of Electric Power Companies, told reporters on Friday, adding that Japanese utilities want to continue using it.

Anne-Sophie Corbeau, a researcher at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, said the U.S. needs to have a consistent and coherent policy on Russian LNG.

“On the one side, they are pressuring their allies to stop importing Russian gas or LNG. But they are not implementing their own sanctions on Arctic LNG 2,” she said, referring to Russia’s large-scale LNG project in northern Siberia which is still delivering LNG to China despite being under U.S. sanctions.

“We’re really going to see nuclear move again. Nuclear is going to become sexy again” Wright said, speaking by a video feed at Utah Sen. John Curtis’ Conservative Climate Summit in Salt Lake City.

Wright said tech companies operating large-scale data centers known as hyperscalers to power AI “really want to see nuclear happen,” and noted they’re investing in advancing nuclear technology.

He said the country is making rapid progress in nuclear fusion, although experts have said the technology will not solve energy problems until the end of the decade or in the early 2030’s.

President Donald Trump has signed executive orders this year intended to bring about a “nuclear renaissance,” and Wright used the same phrase Friday.

“Utah absolutely is going to be a key part of that,” he said.

With nuclear projects coming to Utah, Cox hopes for rural jobs, but that’s no easy task

Utah Republicans, including Gov. Spencer Cox, share the desire to develop nuclear technology in the state, passing legislation creating governing bodies to advance nuclear systems, appropriating $10 million to fund Cox’s nuclear energy regulations through Operation Gigawatt, and making deals with nuclear innovators.

Cox has said he envisions the state as a home to dozens of small modular reactors. In the last six months, the state has signed an agreement with a company owned by Bill Gates to explore a Utah site for a new nuclear reactor and announced a partnership with another firm to bring an advanced reactor to Emery County.

Asked if the Emery County project will get off the ground, Curtis told reporters at his conference Friday, “I don’t think we have a choice of it being a reality, the demands for energy are so high, we have to figure this out.

Carmen Valdez, senior policy associate with HEAL Utah, said she has concerns about possible radiation exposure in communities near nuclear facilities, along with the years that could lapse between public investment and the day a reactor’s up and running.

“We are a little concerned about hearing ‘making nuclear sexy again,’ because there’s a lot of not great things that come with that industry that are just being brushed aside,” Valdez said.

Wright emphasized the plan to raise the nation’s energy output includes keeping coal-fired power plants running.

“I’m also super excited about next-generation geothermal, and frankly, Utah is the leader in that,” he said, referencing an enhanced geothermal plant being built in Beaver County.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47642/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/wright.ames-8.14.1-2048x1536-1-1024x7681760750369.jpg?h=ddb1ad0c&itok=f8CjlLos,N,,2025-10-17 23:05:48.997229

John Curtis believes his colleagues are not too far apart to approve his bipartisan-backed plan changing up wildfire management.
“I think the odds are very, very high,” Curtis, a Republican, told reporters Friday when asked about the chances of the fire proposal reaching final passage.

“I think the odds are very, very high,” Curtis, a Republican, told reporters Friday when asked about the chances of the fire proposal reaching final passage.

The bill was a focus of Curtis’ annual Conservative Climate Summit. The Friday event came just three weeks after President Donald Trump called climate change a “con job” at the United Nations and as the administration plans to keep coal-fired power plants running to meet energy demands.

Curtis said he does not agree with the “demonization of fossil fuels” and believes the nation’s energy demands require multiple types of generation.

Asked about the cancellation of $7.5 billion in clean energy projects, Curtis said, “I have concerns.”

He said he’s not familiar with each project, “but I’ll come back to this: We need every electron we can get.”

Over a video feed on Friday, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright also addressed the canceled projects in a speech to attendees of the climate summit.

“A lot of the stopping of funding of projects we’re working on right now have really been mutual decisions with the original applicants for them, that I think were counting on government support to continue on, you know, subsidized purchases of things that didn’t, that wouldn’t exist without subsidies,” Wright said. “We need things that will fly on their own.”

The National Resources Defense Council has said the projects were “crucial” for manufacturing and grid upgrades, and ending support for them will stall American innovation and competitiveness, raising costs for consumers, and further cementing our reliance on dirty fossil fuels.”

Some Republicans in Congress have shifted away from focusing on climate change, but Curtis said he’s still winning over support from those in his party who attend the yearly event.

“Some of them come, and they fold their arms like that, and they’re very suspicious. And then by the end of the day, they go, ‘I get it’,’” he said, “and they realize that it’s been a mistake for Republicans to not be engaged, because we do, we care deeply about the Earth.”

Curtis is sponsoring the bipartisan fire legislation along with Sens. Alex Padilla of California and John Hickenlooper of Colorado, both Democrats, and fellow Republican Tim Sheehy of Montana.

The wide-ranging bill would set up a Wildfire Intelligence Center, require evaluations of fireshed areas, and boost forest restoration funds, among other changes. Several environmental groups oppose the measure, saying it would open millions of acres of federal land to logging without allowing for scientific review or community input first.

In its fourth year, the event brought together representatives from the energy industry, government and environmental groups, with conversations focused on emerging technology,

the permitting process, employing local workers in new projects, and finding ways for industry and government to work together. Curtis said attendance topped 600.

Part of the event focused on the future of “the future of conservative climate policy” — something Curtis said “absolutely” has a place in today’s world.

“We know that these abandoned wells can pose a significant risk to our environment and to our people.
Oil and natural gas wells are considered to be abandoned in West Virginia if they are idle for 12 months or more.
State money covered plugging 18 abandoned wells in 2023 and about 32 in 2024, per the DEP.","The state of West Virginia is entering into a “first of its kind” public-private partnership with Diversified Energy to ensure oil and natural gas wells owned by the company are properly retired.

The collaboration, called the Mountain State Plugging Fund, will see Diversified invest $70 million toward plugging its non-producing wells across the state over the next 20 years. That $70 million will be put into a fund held by OneNexus, an “insurance provider of financial assurance for asset retirement obligations,” per a news release. The state of West Virginia will be designated as a third-party beneficiary for the fund.

Gov. Patrick Morrisey said the collaboration and the creation of this fund could help set a “new national standard for how energy producing states can lead with both strength and responsibility.”

“We must be responsible stewards of the state’s environment. Historically, in West Virginia and across the country, it’s been a challenge to retire abandoned and orphaned gas wells in a responsible manner,” Morrisey said. “We know that these abandoned wells can pose a significant risk to our environment and to our people. Most of the time in the past, people would look to the taxpayers to bear that cost [of plugging them]. Well today we’re going to change that direction.”

Diversified expects to see at least 1,500 of its wells retired over the next 20 years through the investment, according to Diversified Energy CEO Rusty Hutson, Jr. By 2046, the company plans to increase its plugging capacity to 250 wells annually.

As part of the collaboration, Hutson said Diversified will “bolster” its resources for Next LVL Energy, a Diversified subsidiary located in Bridgeport. Morrisey said the investment will create between 50 and 100 new jobs with an average salary of $75,000 plus benefits.

Hutson said Diversified would like to see other oil and natural gas companies join the effort to plug wells responsibly when they’re taken offline.

Department of Environmental Protection Secretary Harold Ward said earlier this year that there are more than 21,000 abandoned and orphaned wells in the state of West Virginia that can pose varying levels of environmental or health risks for the people and communities near them.

Those risks include oil and gas leaks, methane emissions and groundwater contamination that can impact drinking water, among other things.

Oil and natural gas wells are considered to be abandoned in West Virginia if they are idle for 12 months or more. If there is no known operator for the wells — thousands have been created over the last 150 years — then they are considered orphaned. It is the state’s responsibility to remediate these wells.

According to the abandoned well mapping tool from the DEP, the cost of plugging each well varies, but generally comes in near or above $100,000.

A majority of wells plugged in the state are paid for using federal dollars allocated over recent years, specifically through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act in 2021 and the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022. Per the DEP, both of those federal programs — passed and allocated under former President Joe Biden — are a “significant boon” for the state’s attempts to identify and plug abandoned wells as they provide “substantial” funding to West Virginia that is “crucial” to supporting the state Office of Oil and Gas.

State funds — allocated to the OOG through industry permit fees, bond forfeitures and severance taxes — also go toward plugging wells, but existing bond rates are too low to cover the costs, leaving the remaining fees on taxpayers.

State money covered plugging 18 abandoned wells in 2023 and about 32 in 2024, per the DEP.

Meanwhile, federal funds covered plugging more than 200 abandoned or orphaned wells in 2023 and 2024 respectively. If the federal funding from the IIJA remains active and available, it’s estimated that the state will be able to plug at least 1,200 abandoned wells through 2030.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47659/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/abandoned-oil-well-gettyimages-162984329-1024x6801760695688.jpg?h=50844e28&itok=tUsxB4Wl,N,,2025-10-18 07:00:08.557260

John Curtis believes his colleagues are not too far apart to approve his bipartisan-backed plan changing up wildfire management.

“I think the odds are very, very high,” Curtis, a Republican, told reporters Friday when asked about the chances of the fire proposal reaching final passage.

The bill was a focus of Curtis’ annual Conservative Climate Summit. The Friday event came just three weeks after President Donald Trump called climate change a “con job” at the United Nations and as the administration plans to keep coal-fired power plants running to meet energy demands.

Curtis said he does not agree with the “demonization of fossil fuels” and believes the nation’s energy demands require multiple types of generation.

Asked about the cancellation of $7.5 billion in clean energy projects, Curtis said, “I have concerns.”

He said he’s not familiar with each project, “but I’ll come back to this: We need every electron we can get.”

Over a video feed on Friday, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright also addressed the canceled projects in a speech to attendees of the climate summit.

“A lot of the stopping of funding of projects we’re working on right now have really been mutual decisions with the original applicants for them, that I think were counting on government support to continue on, you know, subsidized purchases of things that didn’t, that wouldn’t exist without subsidies,” Wright said. “We need things that will fly on their own.”

The National Resources Defense Council has said the projects were “crucial” for manufacturing and grid upgrades, and ending support for them will stall American innovation and competitiveness, raising costs for consumers, and further cementing our reliance on dirty fossil fuels.”

Some Republicans in Congress have shifted away from focusing on climate change, but Curtis said he’s still winning over support from those in his party who attend the yearly event.

“Some of them come, and they fold their arms like that, and they’re very suspicious. And then by the end of the day, they go, ‘I get it’,’” he said, “and they realize that it’s been a mistake for Republicans to not be engaged, because we do, we care deeply about the Earth.”

Curtis is sponsoring the bipartisan fire legislation along with Sens. Alex Padilla of California and John Hickenlooper of Colorado, both Democrats, and fellow Republican Tim Sheehy of Montana.

The wide-ranging bill would set up a Wildfire Intelligence Center, require evaluations of fireshed areas, and boost forest restoration funds, among other changes. Several environmental groups oppose the measure, saying it would open millions of acres of federal land to logging without allowing for scientific review or community input first.

In its fourth year, the event brought together representatives from the energy industry, government and environmental groups, with conversations focused on emerging technology,

the permitting process, employing local workers in new projects, and finding ways for industry and government to work together. Curtis said attendance topped 600.

Part of the event focused on the future of “the future of conservative climate policy” — something Curtis said “absolutely” has a place in today’s world.

(Bill) Walker was in office, he created a climate change commission, which again recommended preparing for potential flooding, like what we saw now.
Dunleavy disbanded that commission, and he really hasn't taken on sort of a similar flagship effort to try to address climate change.
Dunleavy this week about whether or not the impacts from the storm were related to climate change.","In the wake of the storm that devastated western Alaska this week, there's been scrutiny of the Trump administration's cancellation of a grant that had been aimed at preventing erosion in one of the hardest hit communities.

Under former President Joe Biden, the Environmental Protection Agency awarded the $20 million grant to the village of Kipnuk in December. But after Trump took office, his EPA canceled the grant, along with millions more meant for climate change mitigation and renewable energy projects.

As the Anchorage Daily News reports, the EPA defended that decision this week.

And while there are questions about whether the grant would've done much to help Kipnuk from the storm that hit Sunday, ADN reporter Iris Samuels says it was supposed to be used to build a protective barrier.

This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.

Iris Samuels: So the village used to be several hundred feet away from the banks of the river, and over time it's gotten closer and closer and closer. So the goal of this grant was to create an erosion barrier, so that homes and village infrastructure that were at risk from the river eroding would be protected. That was the goal of the grant.

Casey Grove: Gotcha. So my understanding is it was canceled earlier this year. How was it canceled? And I guess, also, why was it canceled? Do we know?

IS: So the grant was awarded in December of 2024, and then Trump was elected, President Trump was elected. And in about March, this grant was frozen, and the EPA administrator basically said that they were reviewing all these grants that had to do with what they refer to as ""climate justice,"" and that potentially some of this funding would be reinstated after it went through this review process. But then in May the grant was formally canceled.

CG: And then, of course, this storm hits Kipnuk, Kwigillingok, other communities have been hit really hard by that, obviously. And folks started looking at this grant and the cancelation of this grant. You reached out to the EPA asking about that. What did they say?

IS: Right. So right from the very beginning, there was this awareness that there was, had been, this grant that was canceled. And we actually heard from Sen. Lisa Murkowski saying, essentially, something along the lines of, and this was back on Monday, really, the day after the storm had hit, that while this grant itself wouldn't have actually saved the damage that was inflicted on Kipnuk by this storm, because the construction wouldn't have been completed in time, what this storm really shows is the importance, broadly speaking, of this grant and grants like it, in protecting these types of communities.

So then I reached out to the EPA, and basically they said, ""It's a very good thing that we canceled this grant, because if we hadn't, then construction would have begun, and all the funding that had been awarded would be swept away in the Kuskokwim River,"" is what they said. So all we have is the written statement that the EPA provided from a spokesperson, so we kind of have to do some parsing of our own, but I think for the people of this community, this statement can come across as in a very, sort of, hurtful way, because reading between the lines, it essentially says, ""If there is a risk of this money being wasted, then why spend it at all?""

CG: So now, I mean, from the EPA's perspective, that money has been saved, it's in some account somewhere. Have they said anything about how that might be spent?

IS: So the EPA actually canceled quite a few grants meant for Alaska Native villages and various Alaska communities that were related to the impacts of climate change. And after they canceled hundreds of millions of dollars of grants meant for Alaska, what they did was they actually said, ""Now we're going to divert this money to the Denali Commission.""

And so, basically, this is $140 million that the EPA has said, ""Thanks to the fact that we canceled all these grants, we've now given $140 million to the Denali Commission."" But a lot of that money is already accounted for, for projects that don't have to do with, you know, erosion prevention and things like that. So it's really comparing apples to oranges in some cases.

CG: So we're talking about a $20 million grant specific to Kipnuk. But zooming out, the state has known for quite a while about the risks from this kind of a storm and these kind of impacts. Can you kind of walk me through that? It goes back quite a ways, right?

IS: Right, yeah, it goes back really two decades, and it's both the state and federal agencies that have been doing assessments for years, and kind of pointing to the fact that due to erosion, loss of sea ice, loss of permafrost, all of that is contributing or exacerbating the risks, environmental risks, for a lot of Alaska Native villages. And they've been pointing to potential flooding risks in many of these communities, again, for two decades.

Now we see this paper trail of report after report after report saying, ""We really need to be doing something about this."" And I think that what this storm really shows is, even though people have been saying we really need to be doing something, not enough has been done, and not just for the communities that were affected by this storm, but for quite a few other communities that may be at risk in future storms.

CG: Then, specifically talking about the administration of Gov. Mike Dunleavy, how did they respond to these risks?

IS: So we've seen actually a back and forth in administrations in Alaska for a few years. So actually it was former Gov. Sarah Palin who first created an entity in Alaska that was meant to address the impacts of climate change, and that was this kind of sub-cabinet that she had formed that created these recommendations. Among those recommendations were this idea that we need to prepare for potentially either mitigating erosion or potentially moving certain village sites that were at risk from flooding.

But then her successor (Gov. Sean Parnell) disbanded that sub-cabinet. Then, when former Gov. (Bill) Walker was in office, he created a climate change commission, which again recommended preparing for potential flooding, like what we saw now. And then Gov. Dunleavy disbanded that commission, and he really hasn't taken on sort of a similar flagship effort to try to address climate change.

We do see some of those efforts in some state agencies, so there are people within state government that really are tracking and working really, really hard on this, but without resources and sort of adequate attention, it's really, really difficult to make progress on this.

CG: You had asked Gov. Dunleavy this week about whether or not the impacts from the storm were related to climate change. What did he say about that?",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/15a9a7d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1536x806+0+173/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F0e%2F4f%2F6e76911c428d8e09b122f8d16e89%2F564608313-2068869747198937-3462339078743405247-n-2-crop.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 23:05:35.035284

* Given the recent pattern with the Republican-appointed justices, the White House probably likes its chances in this appeal: “The Trump administration on Friday asked the Supreme Court to immediately allow for the deployment of National Guard troops in Illinois, alleging they are needed to protect federal agents conducting immigration enforcement. The move comes in response to lower court rulings that blocked the effort, with the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday again ruling against the administration.”

* A closely watched meeting: “Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with President Donald Trump at the White House on Friday, with long-range Tomahawk missiles and the trajectory of the war with Russia on the agenda as Kyiv intensifies its push for U.S. military aid.”

* That’s a lot of cases: “South Carolina’s measles outbreak has grown to 15 cases, state health officials reported Friday, a small increase from a few days ago. ... In Ohio, where five cases in the central part of the state have been reported within the last 2½ weeks, quarantine for 122 people was expected to end Friday. ... In the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, 118 kids are now back in school after they were exposed to an outbreak of 20 measles cases. Their quarantine ended Wednesday.”

* I’m eager to learn what the administration intends to do, exactly, with these survivors: “The U.S. is providing medical treatment to survivors from the latest attack on a vessel suspected of transporting illegal drugs in the Caribbean, according to two officials familiar with the matter. The two survivors were rescued by the Coast Guard and taken to the USS Iwo Jima, which has a full medical staff. An unspecified number of others aboard the submersible were killed in the strike, the officials said.”

* The expected plea: “John Bolton, who served as national security adviser during Donald Trump’s first term before becoming a critic of the president, pleaded not guilty on Friday to charges of mishandling classified information.”

* The more this list grows, the better: “The University of Pennsylvania and the University of Southern California on Thursday declined to sign President Trump’s proposal to give funding preferences to schools that agree to concessions, such as capping international enrollment and freezing tuition, and taking steps to protect conservative viewpoints. The rejections raised the number of universities that have said no to the offer to four, reflecting mounting opposition to the deal.”

* The University of Virginia joined the list of schools rejecting the White House’s proposed “compact” on Friday afternoon.

* U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro sure does lose a lot: “There’s already a stunning pattern of grand jurors rejecting indictments sought by the Justice Department in President Donald Trump’s second term — specifically when it comes to allegations of assaulting law enforcement in connection with protests against the administration’s abuses of power. As time goes on, we’ll learn what trial jurors think of the politically motivated cases that make it that far. We got a prime example Thursday in the case of Sidney Reid, who was acquitted in Washington, D.C.”

* A lawsuit worth watching: “More than 20 states sued the Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday, challenging the agency’s decision to cancel a $7 billion program that aimed to make solar power accessible to low-income households.”

* Another lawsuit worth watching: “Three labor unions represented by the Electronic Frontier Foundation sued the Trump administration on Thursday over a program that is searching the social media posts of visa holders, arguing that the practice violates the First Amendment rights of people legally in the United States.”

One such nation is Australia. In a move that underlines the importance of the traditional energy sector, Australia’s gas strategy faces significant strain as midstream supply tightens in the land down under. Its gas sector has faced a troubling time as of late, despite the government’s strategy towards the sector.

The Australian government tries to strengthen its local economy with policies aimed at increasing the gas supply locally

The global energy sector is facing some troubling times ahead. The consensus prevailing around the world is that more needs to be done to increase the percentage of power that is derived from the renewable energy sector.

However, while the rest of the world invests furiously in the renewable energy sector through wind, solar, and nuclear projects, some nations still lean on their most profitable and reliable energy sources. Australia has, for generations, relied on coal and gas exports to prop up the economy.

However, recent reports have emerged that note that despite the government’s efforts, Australia’s gas sector is facing some tough times ahead. The government has implemented policies aimed at increasing supply to the local market by reducing the amount of gas exported out of the land down under.

“There are limits to what the gas policy measures can achieve on their own if the underlying causes of inadequate supply and ineffective competition are not addressed” – ACCC Commissioner Anna Brakey

The Australian Domestic Gas Security Mechanism is a policy developed by the government that mandates producers to set aside a certain percentage for the local market and encourages LNG producers to deliver less gas to their clients.

The danger has been averted for the time being in Australia

The government bodies note that the policy has had an impact, albeit a short-term one. According to the ACCC’s latest report, gas supply for the eastern coast will increase into a surplus in the first quarter of 2026. That sounds great for that side of the country, but what about the rest of Australia?

“Despite the improvement, the supply-demand outlook remains tight in the southern states.” – ACCC Commissioner Anna Brakey

Government institutions warn of a less favorable investment environment in the southern states

The report from the ACCC notes that outside investment may be affected by the lack of sustainable gas production in Australia. The report notes that more work needs to be done to improve the gas sector’s production capabilities to foster international investment.

“For the first time, southern gas producers are not expecting to produce surplus gas in the first quarter of the year, when demand is usually at its lowest. This may create challenges for fully replenishing southern gas storage facilities ahead of winter 2026.” – ACCC Commissioner Anna Brakey

The gas turbine shortages around the midstream sector have further exacerbated the issues. The Australian economy relies heavily on exporting coal and gas, which, according to government reports, may suffer if the current trend continues.

For Detroiters thinking about upgrading to a more eco-friendly home or vehicle, it can be intimidating to invest in such a major purchase, especially with the high upfront costs of new appliances and installations. But high-energy costs are a challenge for Detroiters, with about 30% of residents facing a high-energy burden, meaning they spend more than 6% of their income on utilities. By upgrading to a more energy-efficient home or car, residents can drastically reduce these costs, freeing up income for other necessities and long-term goals.

Home upgrades lower energy costs, increasing property values. But, beyond the savings benefits, a greener community is a healthier community. Eco-friendly upgrades reduce carbon emissions for everyone. Replacing gas-powered vehicles with EVs and reducing reliance on fossil fuels for home energy leads to cleaner air, which is a significant factor in respiratory health, especially for vulnerable residents. Sustainable home improvements like insulation and energy-efficient HVAC systems don’t just save money; they create a more comfortable and healthier indoor environment. By embracing these changes, Detroiters can have a path toward a community that is economically resilient and a better place to live.

The Roadblocks to Going Green

The path to going green at home can feel intimidating. Here are some common concerns:

The Upfront Cost: Eco-friendly upgrades, from solar panel installation to a new electric vehicle, often come with significant initial price tags. The perception that “going green is expensive” is a major barrier, even when the long-term savings are substantial.

The “Red Tape” and Confusion: Navigating the world of government rebates, tax credits, and financing options can feel like a full-time job. Which programs apply to me? What forms do I need? Who can I trust to do the upgrade work? This complexity can lead to a state of “analysis paralysis,” with residents postponing action rather than facing the risk of making the wrong choice.

The Fear of the Unknown: Questions about new technologies are common. “Will my car’s EV’s battery last long enough for my commute?” “Do solar panels work on cloudy Michigan days?” “How do I find a reliable solar contractor?” These legitimate concerns, if left unanswered, can prevent people from moving forward.

That’s why, in celebration of the credit union’s 90th birthday, it introduced the Motor City Green Lending program and the Motor City Green Resource Guide to help Detroiters make green decisions that fit their goals and lifestyles.

The Motor City Green Resource Guide helps users navigate decision-making for eco-friendly home and vehicle upgrades. It cuts through the jargon and simplifies the process, providing clear, actionable information and considerations. Through competitive rates and a variety of flexible financing options, One Detroit Credit Union aims to help new and returning members easily navigate the purchasing process, making eco-friendly choices more accessible to more people in metro Detroit.

“For too long, the transition to green energy has felt complex and out of reach. We’re here to change that,” said Powell. “Our mission is to impact and change lives by removing the barriers—both financial and informational—so that every Detroiter has the power to make sustainable choices that work for their family and their budget.”

The company said that newcleo plans to invest up to $2 billion via an affiliated investment vehicle. Oklo added that Blykalla, Sweden's advanced nuclear technology developer, is also considering co-investing in the same projects and procuring fuel-related services from the projects.

Oklo noted that the investments aim to span multiple projects under U.S. oversight, foster transatlantic cooperation that enhances energy security, and focus on creating a robust and resilient fuel ecosystem. The company added that specific projects and investment amounts will be detailed in forthcoming definitive agreements.

Under the One Big Beautiful Bill (BBB) introduced by U.S. President Donald, tax credits retained in the bill reduce investment risks for advanced nuclear reactors.

“This agreement to implement newcleo's advanced fuel expertise into Oklo's powerhouses and invest $2 billion into American infrastructure and advanced fuel solutions is yet another win for President Donald J. Trump's American Energy Dominance Agenda,” said Secretary of the Interior and Chairman of the National Energy Dominance Council Doug Burgum.

Retail sentiment on Oklo dipped to ‘extremely bearish’ from ‘bearish’ territory a day ago, with message volumes at ‘high’ levels, according to data from Stocktwits.

The company stated that the partnership enhances all parties' capacity to meet the increasing global demand for energy. This also includes co-investment into, and co-location of, fuel fabrication facilities and could include repurposing surplus plutonium in a manner consistent with established U.S. safety and security requirements.

“Fissioning surplus plutonium is the best way to eliminate a legacy liability while creating an abundant near-term fuel source. It can accelerate the deployment of multiple gigawatts of advanced reactors and serve as a bridge fuel until uranium enrichment and recycling scale up,” said Jacob DeWitte, co-founder and CEO of Oklo.

Shares of Oklo have gained 779% in the last 12 months.

THE TOP FIVE

1. More than 20 states sue over Trump’s Solar for All cuts

Nearly two dozen states signed onto two lawsuits Thursday to stop the Trump administration from ending the $7 billion grant program that funded solar panels in low-income communities. The first complaint, filed Wednesday, seeks monetary damages over the Environmental Protection Agency’s bid to eliminate the so-called Solar for All program. A second lawsuit, filed Thursday, seeks to reinstate the program. Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes told Reuters the cancellation affected 900,000 low-income households nationwide, including some 11,000 in Arizona that the state expected to see a 20% spike in bills after losing access to the $156 million in funding from Solar for All. California would lose $250 million in funding. The litigation comes days after Harris County, which encompasses most of Houston, Texas, filed suit against the EPA over its own loss of $250 million due to the program’s termination. Earlier this month, a coalition of solar energy companies, labor unions, nonprofit groups, and homeowners also sued the EPA over the cancellation.

2. The UN’s maritime agency is voting on an emissions-cutting scheme

It remains to be seen whether other countries are willing to balk at the Trump administration’s push to gut key carbon-cutting policies. But at least in theory, later today, the drafting group for the International Maritime Organization, the United Nations agency overseeing global shipping, will vote on an emissions pricing mechanism meant to slash greenhouse gas output from an industry that still relies on some of the most heavily polluting fuels. The scheduled vote comes a day after President Donald Trump pressed the international body to reject the proposal, calling it “the Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping” and vowing to ignore the rules.

The maritime shipping industry accounts for about 3% of global emissions. But the impact of shipping fuels is substantial. As Heatmap’s Robinson Meyer wrote in December, a study found that, when the IMO began enforcing rules to remove a toxic pollutant, sulfur dioxide from shipping fuels, the planet’s temperatures spiked. That’s because, in addition to inflaming the heart and lungs, triggering asthma attacks, and causing acid rain, sulfur dioxide can also reflect heat back into space, artificially cooling the Earth. When that fuel went away, the warming effects of all the carbon in the atmosphere became more apparent.

3. Defense Department drops $500 million tender to buy cobalt

The Department of Defense canceled a tender to buy cobalt, in what the trade publication Mining.com called “a fresh sign of the challenges facing Western countries trying to bolster domestic supplies of the battery metal.” In mid-August, the Defense Logistics Agency first sought offers for up to 7,500 tons of the bluish metal used in batteries and alloys for jet engines over the next five years, in a contract worth as much as $500 million. It was, according to Bloomberg, the U.S. government’s first attempt to acquire the metal since 1990. When no deals came in by the original due date of August 29, the offer was extended to October 15. But a notice published on a government website Wednesday indicated that the offer had been pulled. The move marks an apparent setback for the Pentagon’s effort to stockpile critical minerals, as I reported in this newsletter earlier this week.

While the funding doesn’t produce raw cobalt from mining, as I reported for Heatmap last month, the DLA has backed an Ohio-based startup called Xerion that’s commercializing a novel approach to processing both that metal and gallium, another mineral over which China has tightened export controls recently. It’s not alone. As Heatmap’s Katie Brigham wrote last month, “everybody wants to invest in critical mineral startups.”

4. The U.S. gains a rare earths refinery from Britain, (probably) loses a mine in Madagascar

The British rare earths processor Pensana has canceled plans for a refinery in East Yorkshire, England, in favor of investing in an American project instead. The company spent the past seven years developing a $268 million rare earths mine in Angola. One of the largest of its kind in the world, the project is scheduled to begin delivering raw materials in 2027. To turn that ore into industrial-grade materials, Pensana had planned to build a processing facility at the Saltend Chemicals Plant near Hull, England, that would have turned the metals into powerful magnets. The project won about $6.7 million in support from the British government. But Pensana’s founder and chairman, Paul Atherley, told the BBC that was “nowhere near enough.” He compared the deal to the Trump administration’s direct investment of billions of dollars into MP Materials, the country’s only rare earths mine. Pensana instead announced plans to work with the U.S. refiner ReElement to develop a domestic American supply chain, and plans to list its shares on the Nasdaq. As I wrote in Tuesday morning’s newsletter, the world’s top metals trader warned this week that the West’s mineral weakness is a lack of refining capacity, not mining. “Mining is not critical,” Trafigura CEO Richard Holtum said in London on Monday, according to Mining Journal. “True supply chain security comes from processing investment, not just extraction.”

But even the increased supply of ore from overseas projects could be in jeopardy. I have a scoop this morning in Heatmap that highlights the geopolitical challenges U.S. mining projects face overseas. On Sunday, following weeks of youth-led protests over electricity and water outages, Madagascar’s military overthrew its government in a coup. Now the new self-declared leaders have pulled support for Denver-based mining developer Energy Fuels’ plans for a giant mine that would produce rare earths, uranium, and other metals. The so-called Toliara mine, worth an estimated $2 billion, had won approval from the previous government last winter. But a consultant on the ground in Madagascar’s capital of Antananarivo told me the new leaders had “announced the definitive cancellation” of what was previously described as the future “crown jewel” of an economy where 75% of people live on less than $3 per day and less than 40% of the population has access to electricity.

5. Scientists warn of the ‘Greenlandification’ of Antarctica

As recently as the 1990s, the Greenland Ice Sheet and the Arctic were melting at a measurable pace thanks to global warming, but Antarctica’s ice cap seemed securely frozen. But, as Inside Climate News reported Thursday, “not anymore.” New satellite data and field observations show the only unpopulated continent is thawing at an alarming rate, leading to what some scientists are now calling the “Greenlandification” of Antarctica, turning it into an environment that’s melting at a rate closer to the Arctic.

There’s little question as to what is causing the meltdown. More than 100 countries now experience at least 10 more “hot days” per year than a decade ago, when the Paris climate accord was first drafted, according to new data analysis from the research groups Climate Central and World Weather Attribution published Thursday in the Financial Times. In 10 countries, the warming over the past decade added roughly a month of additional “hot days.”

THE KICKER

The good climate news, reported by Bloomberg: the Bay Area startup Rondo Energy has turned on the world’s largest industrial heat battery, a giant cubic structure that heats clay bricks with electricity from a 20-megawatt solar array to generate steam.

The bad climate news? That steam is used to force more oil out of the ground as part of Holmes Western Oil Corp.’s enhanced oil recovery system.

The mitigating factors to consider: The battery replaced a natural gas-fired boiler at the Kern County, California, facility. And proponents of enhanced oil recovery say the approach meets lasting demand for petroleum by extracting more fuel from existing wells rather than encouraging new drilling.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTc3MTU2OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2NjM4NTk4MH0.USTCcCEYxvbKZxlCwu03eqEk_ZiVcIp5BwjsIfKpa3M/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-10-18 07:00:03.188890

It also takes shifting social attitudes and garnering economic support.

Mukherjee and doctoral student Poulomee Roy highlighted all three of these critical requirements in their project, “Critical Need of the Hour for Renewable Energy Integration in the U.S.,” which won an American-Made Science Synthesis Prize sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Electricity.

Their synthesis paper, “Roadmap for Renewable Integration in the U.S.: Navigating Challenges with Strategic Interventions and Risk-Informed Decision Making,” submitted as part of the project, was named one of eight winners out of 45 submissions from scientists in industry and academia across the world. It comes with a $10,000 cash prize.

“It’s an incredible honor,” Mukherjee says. “This award represents the culmination of teamwork, curiosity and the drive to find creative solutions to the renewable energy challenges of our time. I’m deeply thankful to the Department of Energy for recognizing our work.”

Launched in 2024, the Science Synthesis Prize challenges competitors to highlight pivotal opportunities, solutions and areas of investment to address the complications of integrating various energy sources with the electric grid.

“Our approach was exhaustive and holistic,” says Mukherjee, who also directs UB’s OASIS Laboratory and serves as an adjunct assistant professor of electrical engineering and an affiliate faculty member of the Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. “I think that’s what made our entry stand apart.”

Mukherjee and Roy conducted a systematic review of more than 300 studies conducted worldwide.

“For example, in Europe they are much more advanced in terms of renewable energies,” Mukherjee explains. “So, we reviewed a lot of case studies conducted by different universities and research institutes in Europe, and we found some success stories.”

The biggest takeaway, she says, is that most studies focus on just the technical part of converting to renewable energy, not the social or economic aspects.

“All three areas need attention,” she says. “But the majority of the attention is given to the technical side right now, especially in the U.S.”

For their paper, the two researchers examined the various facets of the challenges and opportunities associated with integrating renewable energy into the grid and then compared them with the current industry outlook.

“First, we analyzed how the various studies are contributing value to the current landscape,” she says. “Then, we’ve identified the gaps, analyzed what we can but are not doing currently, and finally, made suggestions on how we could improve the renewable energy integration process.”

She notes that the technical aspects present significant challenges that will need to be rectified, such as integrating new types of renewable energy into an aging existing grid and transmitting energy from offshore wind and solar plants to the communities that need them.

The social and economic challenges, however, are just as significant.

“Let’s look at the installation of solar panels,” she says. “There’s a huge upfront cost. While there are many clean energy programs where the government subsidizes some of the initial costs, many homeowners and businesses are either unaware of such programs or don’t understand the benefits that they might earn from installing solar panels. Over the next five to 10 years, they may receive significant benefits because of lower electricity bills, but what they see now is how much the panels cost to install.”

The study also recommends various investment strategies, including pooled investments and green bonds, which could help raise funds to cover such upfront costs.

If a community wants to install microgrids, for instance, they could get subsidies to power several homes in that community, Mukherjee says.

“Starting small from the ground level is very important for any type of new technology to flourish,” she says. “But first, you have to get acceptance from the communities.”

The problem is that many discussions on renewable energy integration overlook this crucial step — engaging communities and involving them throughout the decision-making process, from inception to implementation.

“What I’ve learned from other research studies that I’ve conducted is that when you involve the communities in the decision-making process, you’re more successful,” she says. “It plays a major role in transitioning many of these different recommendations for renewable energy integration to policies that are actionable.”",https://www.buffalo.edu/content/shared/university/news/news-center-releases/2025/10/Sayanti-Mukherjee-DOE-Award/_jcr_content/par/image.img.512.auto.jpg/1760721157663.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 22:00:36.685106

“While solar and wind assets have received tax incentives in the past, current tax rates may act as a disincentive to battery investments in Brazil,” PSR highlighted.
However, energy storage is not yet explicitly covered by this mechanism.
In this context, energy storage emerges as a key element in balancing supply and demand.","A PSR report reveals that taxation and regulatory uncertainty are slowing the advancement of energy storage in Brazil, increasing costs and driving away investment. The study advocates for tax incentives and new remuneration models to unlock the sector.

While several countries are accelerating their investments in energy storage to ensure stability and flexibility over the electrical system, Brazil still faces serious obstacles to making this market viable. A study by the consulting firm PSR indicates that the high tax burden and lack of regulatory clarity are among the main obstacles to the development of this technology in the country.

The research, titled “Accelerating the Brazilian Energy Transition – Comprehensive Meta-Analysis of Energy Storage in Brazil”, shows that the average costs of implementing storage systems increase by up to 76% after taxes are applied. This is worrying, especially at a time when the country is trying to expand the use of renewable sources, such as solar and wind, which require greater balancing capacity in the electricity grid.

“While solar and wind assets have received tax incentives in the past, current tax rates may act as a disincentive to battery investments in Brazil,” PSR highlighted.

Lack of specific incentives discourages the sector

Brazil has the Special Incentive Regime for Infrastructure Development (REIDI), created by Law No. 11.488/2007, which reduces taxes on infrastructure projects. However, energy storage is not yet explicitly covered by this mechanism.

According to the study, a legal update would be necessary to include batteries and pumped-storage plants among the projects eligible for the scheme. Furthermore, any proposal seeking REIDI membership must be approved by the National Electric Energy Agency (ANEEL), a bureaucratic and lengthy process that ultimately represents another obstacle to advancing investments.

The PSR points out that, without incentives equivalent to those granted to other renewable sources, the country runs the risk of losing strategic opportunities for technological and industrial development in this field.

Price arbitrage: potential limited by the current structure

One of the most promising uses of storage systems is price arbitrage—buying energy when the cost is low and selling it when the price rises. This practice, common in mature markets like the United States and Europe, is still unlikely to be viable in Brazil.

According to PSR, for a battery system to be economically sustainable in Brazil, an average daily price difference of between US$72 and US$152 per MWh would be required, for four hours per day, over 15 years. Reversible storage plants, on the other hand, would require differences of between US$65 and US$161 per MWh, with eight-hour daily operation and a 40-year lifespan.

However, the Brazilian market still has low granularity in hourly price formation, which significantly reduces arbitrage opportunities. In 2025, the spot energy price is set between US$10,24/MWh and US$269,50/MWh, values ​​that do not guarantee the expected returns for large-scale projects.

Revenue stacking: an alternative to enabling new projects

With arbitration alone unable to justify investments, the PSR advocates for the country to adopt a revenue stacking model. This strategy would allow storage systems to receive remuneration from various sources, such as ancillary services, capacity mechanisms, and support for the operation of the electrical system.

These services include voltage and frequency control, and black start—the restart of electrical systems in the event of a blackout. Currently, most of these functions are performed by thermal and hydroelectric plants.

The creation of ""regulatory sandboxes,"" which serve as testing environments for new business models, is seen as a step forward, but still insufficient. The study cites, for example, the reactive power support project, whose remuneration for 2025 was set at US$1,72/Mvar-h. There are also plans to open sandboxes for secondary frequency control and black start, with fixed remunerations of US$11.735 and US$8.801 per year, respectively.

PSR warns: flexibility is essential for the country's energy future

With the growing penetration of solar and wind energy sources, the Brazilian electricity system needs more flexibility to ensure security and stability. In this context, energy storage emerges as a key element in balancing supply and demand.

""Brazil has great potential to develop the storage market, but this depends on adjustments to tax policy, improved regulation, and the creation of new remuneration models,"" the study concludes.

Without structural changes, the country risks falling behind in the race for energy transition, precisely at a time when the world is moving toward a cleaner, more resilient, and decentralized energy matrix.",https://clickpetroleoegas.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/armazenamento-de-energia-no-brasil.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 02:59:34.057370

“These funds were going to help low-income and rural North Carolinians save money on their energy bills,” he said.
“Thousands of families were going to have the option to install solar power, save money, and have another energy option after a major storm.
“The bottom line is this: EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive.
The solar energy industry employs over 9,000 North Carolinians and supports more than 200 businesses across the state.","On Thursday, Attorney General Jeff Jackson joined 21 other states and the District of Columbia in suing the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for canceling the $7 billion Solar for All program.

Created in 2022 by the Inflation Reduction Act, the program was designed to provide funding to 60 grant recipients, with the goal of helping an estimated 900,000 low-income households across the country utilize solar power to reduce their energy costs.

Jackson said in a press release that the funds would have helped more than 12,000 households in North Carolina save an average of 20% on their utility bills and supported energy jobs.

“These funds were going to help low-income and rural North Carolinians save money on their energy bills,” he said. “Thousands of families were going to have the option to install solar power, save money, and have another energy option after a major storm. Now the EPA has illegally cancelled those funds — so I’m going to court to bring $150 million back to our state.”

In 2024, the EnergizeNC coalition, led by the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (NCDEQ), applied for and was awarded a $156 million Solar for All grant from the EPA. According to Jackson’s press release, over five years, the program would have helped create at least 43 megawatts of solar energy and offered financial assistance to help low-income, single-family homes, multifamily housing, households with medical needs, and community solar pilot programs install rooftop solar.

The cancellation, Jackson said, left the state without more than $150 million of the $156 million it had been awarded, and the grants were “abruptly cancelled without a valid legal basis, and the attorneys general are suing to win back this money that is legally due to North Carolina and other states.”

On Aug. 7, the EPA canceled the program, which was included in the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. Lee Zeldin, administrator for the EPA, discussed the cancellation, which resulted from the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”

“In some cases, your tax dollars were diluted through up to FOUR pass-through entities, each taking their own cut off the top!” he said in a post on X. “The bottom line is this: EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive. Today, the Trump EPA is announcing that we are ending Solar for All for good, saving US taxpayers ANOTHER $7 BILLION!”

NCDEQ Secretary Reid Wilson said in the release that the cancellation of the program would eliminate the installation of rooftop solar panels for more than 12,000 low-and medium-income families.

“Rooftop solar drives down utility bills, reduces air pollution, and creates jobs,” he said. “The program’s cancellation would hurt the electric grid’s ability to be resilient to future disasters, and would hamper North Carolina’s efforts to ensure reliable, clean, and affordable energy supplies to meet the needs of a rapidly growing population and rising energy demand.”

The funds, the release said, would also have helped households transition to more reliable sources of energy and prevent power outages caused by natural disasters, like Hurricane Helene.

Additionally, it stated that the Solar for All program was also designed to help create an additional 140 new local jobs, including those for contractors, construction workers, and maintenance staff. The solar energy industry employs over 9,000 North Carolinians and supports more than 200 businesses across the state.

Jon Sanders, director of the Center for Food, Power, and Life at the Jon Locke Foundation, told Carolina Journal that although Jackson’s statement that the Solar for All program would have saved low-income people and their families on their power bills and created jobs is true, there is no reason for the attorney general to think that the Solar for All program is the only, or even a good, way to lower power bills and create jobs.

“With respect to helping low-income families pay for getting solar panels installed on their houses, the program could do so only for those low-income families that have a house,” he told CJ. “Others in low-income apartments and multifamily housing would not be able to avail themselves of any putative benefits. Also, the jobs he is talking about would be contract installation jobs chasing subsidized work, not full-time jobs from an expanding economy.”

Sanders said the economic research literature is filled with studies demonstrating that faster job growth happens in economies with less regulation, lower tax burdens, and greater protection of individual rights against the government.

“I would welcome a North Carolina attorney general adopting those goals for his vision of the state,” he said.

Sanders added that, given that electricity is a vital expense for all households and an input cost for every business in the state, resource decisions that result in lower power bills would lead to a stronger economy and more job creation than otherwise.",https://www.carolinajournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/solar-panels-943999_1280.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 23:59:37.887561

During a public hearing, business leaders raised concerns the new land-use change could harm Eugene’s economic competitiveness. Residents and advocacy groups urged stronger protections for west Eugene neighborhoods long affected by industrial pollution. Public comment is open through Oct. 28.

Eugene business leaders are pushing back against a proposed land-use policy aimed at better managing pollution and protecting public health.

The Public Health Standards project is an effort, four years in the making, to keep the environment clean for people who live in or near industrial areas. The project includes several possible land-use regulations that would apply to new development.

As of October, city staff is working on one of the potential code amendments.

Under the latest draft of that code change, properties engaged in certain levels of industrial production must have — or be in the process of obtaining — water, land and air pollution permits from the Lane Regional Air Protection Agency and the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality before receiving a building permit.

At a public hearing of the Eugene Planning Commission on Tuesday, Oct. 16, Joe Liebersbach, director of business advocacy at the Eugene Area Chamber of Commerce, said the chamber has “significant concerns” about the proposal.

Liebersbach called it a “misapplication of land-use law” and said the chamber worries the proposed code could hurt Eugene’s economic competitiveness, affecting job creation and access to living-wage employment.

NW Natural, a natural gas provider, and Sierra Pacific Industries, a forest products company, both submitted written public comment to the city underscoring the points made by Liebersbach.

In a statement to Lookout Eugene-Springfield, Liebersbach said, “Our concern isn’t with the goal, but with how it’s achieved. We believe public health standards can and should be strengthened through clear, objective and coordinated processes that promote accountability and economic vitality, but those goals are not achieved through land-use code amendments.”

A vision shift

Tuesday’s discussion marked a shift in how the project has been framed. Earlier this year, many conversations focused on preventing the work of bad actors such as the shuttered and Superfund-listed J.H. Baxter & Co. By Tuesday, the conversation had turned to whether new regulations would be effective in stopping violations of that magnitude.

Eugene Planning Commissioner Tiffany Edwards asked the city’s land-use supervisor, Reid Verner, who’s been overseeing the project, if current businesses are operating without required environmental permits.

“There’s no specific quantitative evidence regarding this, but there is anecdotal evidence from our talks with LRAPA and DEQ that there have been instances where applicants come to the city, obtain building permits, and start developing the site only to later receive complaints. Then they find out they hadn’t started the LRAPA or DEQ permitting process that was required,” Verner said.

Such instances are why Beyond Toxics Executive Director Jen Davis emphasized the need for meaningful protections during her public comment.

Davis, who stepped into the Beyond Toxics role earlier this year, pointed to the environmental justice group’s original policy request: overlay zones. An overlay zone is a special zoning layer placed on top of existing zoning to add or modify regulations for an area without changing the underlying zoning. In this case, the overlay zone would require buffers between homes and industrial areas where the two converge.

Currently, the only such zone is the Clear Lake overlay, which created a buffer around the site of a planned facility by a developer known for building Amazon distribution centers.

Residents in the Trainsong and Bethel neighborhoods — who live in a V-shaped wedge between some of Eugene’s most heavily industrialized areas — bear the city’s most concentrated pollution, Beyond Toxics said.

Those neighborhoods, however, lack any city-sanctioned public health protections.

“The human costs are real. Families in west Eugene have faced higher rates of cancer, asthma, and other chronic illnesses. Parents have watched their children suffer with preventable health problems,” said Davis, who was joined by Arjorie Arberry-Baribeault.

Arberry-Baribeault lived in Bethel when Baxter illegally boiled off toxic wastewater into the air. Her daughter was diagnosed with, and survived, Hodgkin’s lymphoma — a cancer that weakens the body’s ability to fight infections.

“Had there been a code like the public health standards in place before my child’s illness in 2018, I believe what my child went through could have been avoided,” Arberry-Baribeault said. “My seat at the table has brought the voices of the community into decision-making spaces, bringing humanity into a conversation too often only discussed in statistics.”

Next steps

The Public Health Standards processwas hobbled when city staff failed to follow through with plans to perform a technical analysis that could have provided key data to help persuade city councilors to continue the project. In its absence, residents of the area have argued that their own experiences should factor into that analysis.

City staff have pointed to challenges finding qualified experts. As of May, the hazard and risk assessment remains in progress. The city did not get back to Lookout Eugene-Springfield on its status as of Wednesday.

The assessment will inform potential additional code amendments for new development in or near industrial areas. In the meantime, Verner’s team continues to revise the single code amendment, related to LRAPA and DEQ permits as directed by the City Council.

Staff will make further revisions based on feedback, including comments from Lane Regional Air Protection Agency Director Travis Knudsen, who told commissioners he supports enhanced procedures in the interest of public health but is concerned about how they would function within existing processes. The team is also considering additional feedback from other agencies and community members.",https://i0.wp.com/lookouteugene-springfield.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/20250812_EugeneStock_022_IW-scaled-1.jpg?fit=2560%2C1707&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-18 02:59:28.570956

A Proclamation

From the Appalachian Mountains to the Mississippi River to the Great Plains and beyond, for nearly 250 years, America has been endlessly sustained and enriched by our abundance of precious natural resources like oil, clean coal, minerals, and natural gas. This National Energy Dominance Month, my Administration proudly recommits to harnessing the liquid gold and minerals under our feet and bountiful resources in our waters, forests, and fields, achieving American energy dominance, and forging a future defined by three simple words: “Drill, baby, drill.”

During my first term in office, America became the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world and the coal industry was coming back — after eight hard years of Obama’s War on Coal. Tragically, after the conclusion of my first term, the previous administration launched a war on American energy — reversing all of my historic first term actions, leading all 50 States to hit record-high gas prices. Meanwhile, the Green New Scam shuttered dozens of coal plants leaving our power grid vulnerable, halted mining productions, and shipped our energy jobs from Texas to Tehran, from the Midwest to Moscow, and from Baton Rouge to Beijing. As I have stated many times before, energy security is national security. My predecessor outrageously depleted our Strategic Petroleum Reserve — emboldening our enemies and making us reliant on foreign nations while subjecting the American people to sky-high energy prices here at home.

This period of national self-destruction ended on January 20, 2025. As the 47th President of the United States, my energy policy is defined by maximum production, maximum prosperity, and maximum power. On my first day in office, I declared a National Energy Emergency to lower escalating energy prices. I signed an Executive Order to unleash American energy, which rolled back energy restrictions imposed by the previous administration. I established the National Energy Dominance Council to ensure the American energy industry maintains its global leadership in the decades to come. I also took action to revive America’s dominance in offshore critical minerals and resources, lift burdensome regulations on coal plants to ensure they can continue to run, launch the nuclear energy renaissance, and open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, one of the largest drilling sites in the world. Every day, we are making good on our promise to restore the United States as a global energy superpower — and our work has only just begun. Now, under my Administration, our workers are drilling, mining, and producing like never before.

This month, we continue our crusade to bring back American energy dominance, uplift the American worker, protect the American industry, cherish American resources, and make America the most prosperous country on the face of the Earth.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2025 as National Energy Dominance Month.

What’s The Punctum Of The 2025 Hyundai Elantra Hybrid?","New cars are way too freaking expensive. Sure, they have more showroom appeal than ever before, but a lot of people who could spend about $30,000 on a new car ten years ago can still only spend about $30,000 on a new car. At the same time, fuel’s become more expensive, and the number of cars out there for less than 30,000 greenbacks is smaller than ever before. Thank goodness the Hyundai Elantra Hybrid still exists.

This isn’t the first time we’ve been behind the wheel of Hyundai’s electrified compact sedan, but a lot has changed since 2023. Not only did the Elantra get a facelift, the whole new car market has grown even more wild. Just last month, the average price of a new car in America crossed the $50,000 barrier, and while part of that was due to a rush on EVs before federal tax credits ended, it still means we’re living in a world where a four-figure car payment is increasingly normalized. So what can you still get for less than half that? An excellent daily driver, as it turns out.

Why Does It Exist?

In case you haven’t looked at the new car market in a decade, hybrids are hotter than those glowing metal balls you see while doomscrolling, so it simply makes sense that Hyundai builds an Elantra Hybrid to do battle against the Toyota Corolla Hybrid and the Honda Civic Hybrid. When it comes to reasonably priced fuel-sippers, this is one of the big three.

How Does It Look?

You know how baby pangolins always look like they’re about to sheepishly deliver some mildly sad but not day-ruining news? I know we humans are prone to anthropomorphizing everything under the sun, but I swear there’s a hint of endangered scaly anteater to the look of the Elantra. Maybe it’s the interplay of the bulbous silhouette with the angular character lines, maybe it’s exacerbated by the diamond pattern in the C-pillar filler panels, but like the strange-looking animal, this is one strange-looking car. Still, sometimes good things come in strange-looking packages.

What About The Interior?

Maybe it’s just me, but as the average car continues to grow more expensive, I’m warming up to the cabin of Hyundai’s value sedan. Alright, I wouldn’t trust the console grab handle to withstand much more than the weight of a chicken shawarma platter, but apart from that, nothing inside the Elantra feels flimsy or egregiously cheap. Some of it’s properly nice, like real metal trim and available denim-like cloth on the door cards. The only real complaint I have when it comes to usability is the metal trim on the steering wheel. It’s right where the edge of your palms rest with your hands at nine-and-three, and it gets frigid when the mercury hits the zone that tells you who’s wearing too thin a shirt.

Besides, the big story here is space and comfort. It’s no secret the Elantra is big-boned for a compact, but that just means you can get three real adults in the rear seat, and all of their luggage for a weekend away fits in the 14.2 cu.-ft. trunk. Of course, the best seats in the house are still up front, with a surprising amount of support for compact car thrones. We’re talking cushions that don’t seem like topographical maps of Kansas and instead actually feel designed for real human beings, a good reason to consider the Elantra Hybrid over the Corolla Hybrid. I do wish the tilt-and-telescoping steering column telescoped further towards the driver, but the overall driving position is perfectly comfortable for someone of average height.

How Does It Drive?

Of course, if you’re considering making a Hyundai Elantra Hybrid your next daily driver, it’s probably not simply due to its spaciousness and out-there looks. After all, you can get those in a regular non-hybrid model, but the hybrid powertrain really is something special beyond its headline fuel economy figures.

On paper, it may only pump out 132 horsepower, but 195 lb.-ft. of combined torque mean that off the mark and when changing lanes, the Elantra Hybrid always feels perfectly quick enough. What’s more, because this sedan uses a six-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission instead of a CVT, you aren’t forced to listen to an atonal wall of sound should you need to put the skinny pedal to the carpet. Score. Of course, this test car has the big wheels that knock fuel economy down a touch, but it still returned an honest 51 MPG with journalists treating the throttle pedal like a stompbox all day.

Even though the Elantra Hybrid gets multilink rear suspension, don’t expect it to feel like a sport compact car with hybrid efficiency. This thing leans firmly toward comfort, because most people just want a smooth ride home after eight hours in the cubicle. It turns out that all the fuss Hyundai made about structural adhesives means the comfy suspension can actually do its job, so this compact sedan glides over bumps with the grace of a midsizer. See, the operative word here is “natural.”

The steering weighs up like you’d expect steering to. The brake pedal feels normal, almost like it doesn’t have to blend regenerative braking from the electric motor with hydraulic braking from the, um, brakes. Even the shifter’s normal, so you could give the Elantra Hybrid to someone who’s been driving a 2006 Civic for the past two decades, and nothing will seem weird to them. Fantastic.

Does It Have The Electronic Crap I Want?

Sort-of. All the gadgetry inside the Elantra Hybrid feels a bit five years ago, but in ways that aren’t exactly a letdown. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto only work over a wired USB-A connection, but Hyundai’s previous-generation infotainment system is still reasonably slick, with logical menus and plenty of physical controls. The digital gauge cluster might not show you what song’s currently playing, but you can set it to this fun cube-themed skin that delivers a bong hit of when-the-internet-was-fun nostalgia directly into your hippocampus.

This fully-loaded trim gets a moonroof, dual-zone climate control, wireless smartphone charging, GPS navigation, heated seats, a heated steering wheel, an eight-speaker Bose sound system that isn’t too shabby considering the segment, and ambient lighting, all for a shade over $31,000. That’s a lot of kit for the money.

Three Things To Know About The 2025 Hyundai Elantra Hybrid:

Diesel-like torque means it doesn’t feel slow.

It uses a subdivided section of its hybrid battery pack to power its 12-volt electrics, so you’ll never have to buy a replacement lead-acid battery for it.

You can get one loaded to the gills with toys for about the same price as the cheapest Civic Hybrid.

Does It Fulfill Its Purpose?

Absolutely. The Hyundai Elantra Hybrid is a lot of good, economical car for the sort of money normal people can actually justify. Whether you’re looking at the $26,695 Elantra Hybrid Blue or the $31,045 Elantra Hybrid Limited, it feels like your money’s going far. While a comparably equipped Honda Civic Hybrid is quicker and more premium-feeling, it’s also thousands of dollars more expensive. At the same time, a Corolla Hybrid doesn’t feel much nicer than the Elantra Hybrid, is a whole lot slower, isn’t as comfortable, and costs about the same as the Hyundai. Even though Toyota has a rock-solid hybrid system, you still have to sit in that driver’s seat every day, so the Elantra Hybrid gets my vote hands-down.

Believe it or not, the Elantra Hybrid is an even better deal in Canada, where its single loaded trim level undercuts the cheapest Civic Hybrid by several thousand loonies, and works out about even with a mid-range Corolla Hybrid on price while offering a handful of features unavailable on the Toyota.

What’s The Punctum Of The 2025 Hyundai Elantra Hybrid?

With loads of toys, a great price, proper hybrid fuel economy, and solid comfort, welcome to the happy medium of the hybrid compact sedan market.

In September, the House passed resolutions under the Congressional Review Act (CRA)—a little-known 1996 law that Congress enacted to overturn certain federal agency actions through a special review process—to roll back three resource management plans (RMPs) for managing public lands under the BLM for Montana, Alaska and North Dakota. Those plans collectively guide decisions on over 166 million acres, shaping oil and gas leasing, renewable energy, grazing and habitat protections. The Senate voted to approve all three rollbacks on Oct. 8 and 9.

‎While there are no BLM managed public lands in any Midwest states, those who track public land policy warned that if the CRA applies to BLM, for example, it could potentially also apply to U.S. Forest Service (USFS), the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and National Park Service plans. Those agencies oversee lands in Midwest, Southern and East Coast states.

“It would translate into potentially reviewing plans by the Forest Service as well as the Fish and Wildlife Service for the management of national wildlife refuges, as well as the National Park Service,” said Sam Kalen, McKinney Family Chair in Environmental Law at Indiana University McKinney School of Law. Kalen joined 30 other legal experts in signing an open letter opposing the resolutions last month.

“What you would see next is an effort to try to mirror what’s happening in the West to park lands, or wildlife lands, or forest lands…,” he said. “What we’re seeing is an effort by some in Congress, as well as potentially maybe some in the administration, to try to adversely affect how we’re going to be managing and protecting our resources in the future.”

Invoking the CRA in this manner would give Congress the final word on documents that have historically been crafted through years of federally mandated public comment, tribal and stakeholder consultation, on-the-ground land manager input and environmental review intended to balance multiple uses, such as grazing, energy development, recreation and conservation.

If the CRA application broadens as experts fear it will, every time a new plan is developed to determine the management objectives and activities allowed on those lands in the future, the agency will have to submit the plan changes to Congress.

Kalen gave the example of the BLM plan to end coal leasing in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming. “If you want to change the plan to allow coal leasing, what that would mean is you would go develop a new plan, and you’d have to submit that to Congress with a potential CRA possibility,” Kalen said. “What I think some of the Republicans want to do is be able to take a look at the plans issued under the Biden administration, such as the plan that effectively shut down coal leasing, and be able to overturn that plan.”

If an agency such as the USFS wanted to change an existing plan for activities that occur on public lands, the plan would be subject to congressional disapproval. This hasn’t been done in the past, and “it’s going to create a nightmare and considerable uncertainty for all affected parties if the agencies have to wait and see what happens in Congress under the CRA every time they change or amend their plans,” Kalen said.

This is worrisome, he said, because of the CRA’s “substantially similar” clause, which prohibits agencies from issuing new rules that are too much like those Congress has rejected using the act. However, the term is poorly defined, so plans could be struck down without explanation, making it more difficult for agencies to draft a new one.

If an agency goes through the process for developing a plan, including gathering public input and working on the plan for over a year and the plan gets thrown out, that agency has also wasted time, resources and expertise. This could deter them from developing new plans, he explained.

The CRA was intended to be used to overturn recently enacted federal regulations. Kalen speculated that Republicans’ objective is to more easily overturn plans passed during the Biden administration, as this is not the first time the Trump administration has used it. For example, Trump rescinded Obama-era methane rules, along with about 100 other environmental regulations, during his first term. But within months of Biden’s election, the Democratic-controlled Congress rescinded Trump’s rescission of the methane rules; it was one of three Trump actions lawmakers killed using the CRA.

Another expert who also signed the open letter explained that since BLM manages public lands under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, invoking the CRA in this context could have long-term implications for management plans on other statutes.

“If Congress is successful in using the CRA to overturn a BLM resource management plan, they could then use the same principles to overturn other federal agencies’ planning documents,” said Alexandra Klass, a law professor at the University of Michigan Law School who also served as the deputy general counsel for energy efficiency and clean energy demonstrations at the Department of Energy from April 2022 to July 2023. “I don’t think it’s an appropriate use of the CRA for any of them, but it’d be the same idea.”

Klass added that although agencies like the USFS have their own planning processes under their respective enabling statutes, if Congress is able to invoke the CRA for BLM plans, “they could do it for the department of the Forest Service’s equivalent.”

“In theory, if they are successful in using the CRA to get rid of a resource management plan, they could do that anywhere,” she added, but specified that experts’ main concerns are currently about Western plans. Many land use plans in Midwest states, she explained, are decades old and less likely to be targeted than Biden-era plans in Western states.

Long term, Klass said that requiring plans to be approved by Congress could result in BLM lands that are not protective of the environment, as “it takes away some of the tools that the agency has to guide land use.” For example, BLM has a multiple-use mandate that requires an RMP to balance recreation, industry and environmental protection, setting priorities for different types of lands that have various features and resources.

“By taking those away you could have uncertainty for different types of activities,” Klass said, “and you also have much less ability to restrict certain types of development that can harm other uses of federal lands.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2240765539-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 19:03:23.267843

This approval clears a critical hurdle for Micron Technology’s planned $100 billion semiconductor megafab in Clay.

The decision links energy infrastructure, jobs, and clean power to one of the largest private investments in U.S. manufacturing history. The move also ties into the CHIPS and Science Act and the push to rebuild domestic chip capacity.

Micron Plant and New York’s power transmission approval

The Micron Plant is Micron Technology’s plan for a massive memory chip factory and supporting campus in Central New York. The company needs reliable, high-capacity electricity to run fab tools, cleanrooms, and cooling systems.

New York’s Public Service Commission approved a transmission line to bring that power to the site. This line is meant to deliver stable, low-carbon energy, making advanced chip-making possible at scale.

The project now moves from planning into infrastructure delivery, a major step for the Micron Plant timeline.

Why is this approval a turning point? Because a megafab needs steady, scaled power, this approval removes a key bottleneck for construction and operation.

Why the power transmission project matters for the Micron Plant

The transmission project connects the Micron Plant to New York’s grid and to renewable energy sources. Officials said the plan will help Micron meet sustainability goals while ensuring operational reliability.

The state aims to integrate hydropower and other clean sources over time, which supports Micron’s (MU) target to run on greener energy.

For a semiconductor plant, energy stability is not optional; it is central to yield and uptime. The approved transmission line gives Micron (MU) that foundation.

Why did New York approve this project now? Timing reflects infrastructure readiness, political support, and the urgency to secure U.S. chip supply chains.

Micron Plant economic and technological impact for Syracuse and beyond

The Micron Plant promises large economic gains for Central New York. Micron projects tens of thousands of jobs when construction and supply chains are counted. Local universities, including Syracuse University, stand to gain from training programs and research partnerships.

The factory will also anchor a regional semiconductor cluster that could attract suppliers and service firms. At the national level, the plant strengthens U.S. capacity for memory chips, reducing reliance on overseas manufacturing and supporting industries from data centers to AI.

Can this project reshape America’s semiconductor future? Yes, by adding domestic capacity, it lowers strategic risk and builds a local tech ecosystem.

Sustainability and clean energy integration for the Micron Plant

Micron has made public commitments to sustainability. The company aims to ramp up renewable energy use and efficiency in its operations. The new transmission project helps by enabling access to cleaner sources, including hydropower and solar, which New York plans to expand.

Aligning the Micron Plant with the state’s clean energy goals also supports the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act objectives. Running a chip fab on greener power reduces the carbon footprint of the entire tech stack.

How green will the Micron Plant be? The plant is planned with a path toward high renewable use, and the transmission line is a major enabler.

Government and industry reactions to the Micron Plant approval

Gov. Kathy Hochul and state leaders praised the decision as a win for jobs and clean industry. Micron’s executives highlighted the project as a step toward U.S. chip leadership and supply chain resilience. Industry groups noted the approval as a sign that states can partner on large-scale infrastructure that supports advanced manufacturing.

The tone from both the government and Micron (MU) suggests steady collaboration ahead for permitting, grid upgrades, and workforce programs. (Channel News Asia, Investing.com.)

What did leaders say about the project? Officials framed the approval as a boost for regional growth and national tech security.

Broader implications for the semiconductor industry from the Micron Plant

The Micron Plant joins a wave of U.S. chip investments, alongside other large projects like Intel’s Ohio expansions and TSMC’s Arizona site. Memory chip demand grows as AI, cloud, and automotive applications need more storage and faster processing. Micron’s megafab is aimed at meeting that demand.

The project also signals to global markets that the U.S. intends to be a major player in memory chip production, not only in logic chips. This balance matters for both commerce and national security.

How does Micron compare to other chip projects? Micron’s plan is among the largest in scale, focusing on memory and storage technology, which complements logic chip investments.

The road ahead for the Micron Plant, infrastructure, and community plans

Next steps for the Micron Plant include construction of the transmission line, ground breaking on fab buildings, environmental reviews, and workforce training rollouts. Federal CHIPS Act funds and state incentives will support parts of the build.

Micron (MU) also plans R&D collaborations and supplier outreach to grow the local ecosystem. The company and state leaders have signalled plans for community investments, including schools and training centers to prepare local talent for high-tech jobs. Timelines will unfold over the next several years as construction ramps up.

What should communities expect next? Expect construction jobs, supplier growth, and long-term technical roles, along with infrastructure improvements.

Conclusion: Why the Micron Plant power approval matters nationally

The New York approval of the power transmission project clears a major hurdle for the Micron Plant. It links clean energy, high-tech manufacturing, and regional economic growth. More than a local win, it is a national signal that the U.S. can build the energy and industrial backbone needed for advanced chip-making.

If Micron (MU) delivers on its plans, the plant will be a landmark in America’s effort to regain semiconductor strength, while showing how clean infrastructure can support next next-generation industry.

The Micron Plant is now closer to becoming a real engine of jobs and innovation. The interplay of technology, sustainability, and policy in this project may shape the next decade of U.S. manufacturing.

""Some of them come, they fold their arms like that and they’re very suspicious,"" he said Friday. ""Then by the end of the day, they’re ‘Oh I get it.’ They realize it’s been a mistake for Republicans to not be engaged. Because we do, we care deeply about the Earth. We tend to talk about it differently.""

Sen. Curtis has earned a reputation as one of the few Republican political leaders to talk about climate change. He brings together people from all sides at the Conservative Climate Summit to talk about environmental issues and try to find solutions.

On Friday at the University of Utah, there were discussions about water demands, renewable energy sources, land issues and nuclear power. People wore green hats that declared ""Make America Beautiful Again."" Sen. Curtis touted bipartisan legislation on forest management and wildfire mitigation making its way through Congress. Speaking to reporters, the senator emphasized his support for an ""all of the above"" approach to energy.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright endorsed Utah's nuclear power ambitions during a discussion with the senator (Wright appeared virtually because of the ongoing U.S. government shutdown).

""Nuclear’s going to become sexy again,"" Wright declared to a packed ballroom. ""I’m also super excited about next-generation geothermal. And frankly, Utah is the leader in that.""

But not all topics bring everyone together. Wright endorsed extending the life of some coal plants, arguing that America's energy demands call for it. Some environmentalists in the room were less-than-thrilled.

""What’s not sexy is the increasing costs from the nuclear industry,"" Carmen Val Dez with the Healthy Environmental Alliance of Utah told FOX 13 News. ""From building plants that increase over time, the long timelines it’s going to take to these plants on board, which may not meet our energy needs or climate needs, frankly. As well as not really addressing or acknowledging the harms the nuclear industry has had on Utah.""

Val Dez said she did like what Sen. Curtis was trying to accomplish with the Conservative Climate Summit.

""Climate doesn’t impact just one party or the other,"" she said.

Eliza Cowie with Stewardship Utah said she has appreciated Sen. Curtis' efforts to try to extend renewable energy credits. She said the summit was also important in educating people.

""I think it is an important step in a larger process of addressing our climate solutions,"" she said.

Asked about the Trump administration's rollback of some renewable energy projects, Sen. Curtis told reporters: ""I have concerns. I’m not familiar project by project enough to know all the particulars, but I’ll come back to this — we need every electron we can get.""",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7dc58de/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x672+0+24/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcf.cdn.uplynk.com%2Fausw2%2Fslices%2F7eb%2Fef205c0e5ea14d77944cbd6904335118%2F7eb9b5a870a74d8a9e3d3109ec994733%2Fposter_ddaa7f5e6a224a1f8151334d97aed00b.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 19:03:05.655237

The board’s approval of the rezoning conditions is nonbinding but indicates a favorable recommendation of the proposal to the Apex Town Council based on environmental impacts when the council considers the rezoning, if the conditions are met.
“We’re trying to work in a collaborative way with the town, with the community,” Natelli says.
Still, the impacts of emerging data storage facilities, used to power technology and increasingly powerful AI, are being felt across the country.
But the Town of Apex has its own local distribution and transmission rates.","At the heart of the debate over whether Apex should annex and rezone a parcel of land located in New Hill just south of Old U.S. Highway 1 for a proposed data storage facility is a central question: Do town leaders envision that property as a corridor for future industrial growth, or do they want it to remain rural pastureland?

If it’s the former, developer Michael Natelli argues, his company’s proposed New Hill Digital Campus is an ideal use for the site; if it’s the latter, he says, his business here is done.

The town’s long-range planning documents, including its Comprehensive Plan, have identified the site for industrial use for at least the past decade, but it is currently zoned for low-density residential.

On Thursday evening, the Town of Apex’s Environmental Advisory Board (EAB), working on the assumption that Apex leaders are still planning for that industrial use, voted 6–3 to side with Natelli after his company, Natelli Investments, LLC, submitted rezoning conditions aimed at addressing the environmental impacts of the project, including sound pollution, water and electricity usage, and the presence of diesel-fueled generators proposed for the site.

The board is composed of volunteers with expertise in conservation, environmental engineering, land use, and related areas. The board’s approval of the rezoning conditions is nonbinding but indicates a favorable recommendation of the proposal to the Apex Town Council based on environmental impacts when the council considers the rezoning, if the conditions are met. The town’s planning board will weigh in on the land use, and the town council will ultimately decide whether to grant the rezoning to industrial use. Continued opposition from residents is expected.

In an interview ahead of the board meeting earlier this week, Natelli told the INDY that he recognizes the proposal would be a major change for the area, but if the town is going to stick with its plan for an industrial use for the site, a data storage facility would be less disruptive than a manufacturing plant, recycling facility, or distribution warehouse, for example. He says the company will go beyond basic requirements for buffers, setbacks, and vegetation to minimize light and noise pollution, and at the board meeting, he committed to regular sound testing and monitoring.

“We’re trying to work in a collaborative way with the town, with the community,” Natelli says.

Still, the impacts of emerging data storage facilities, used to power technology and increasingly powerful AI, are being felt across the country. Large facilities like this one use staggering amounts of electricity and in some cases water, and for many Americans living close to them, the quality-of-life issues are real.

“As a founding member of this board, I don’t think there could possibly be enough zoning conditions to mitigate the negative effects of this proposal,” said EAB member Katie Schaaf, one of the dissenting voters, at Thursday’s meeting.

Natelli acknowledges that there is a lot of negative media coverage about data centers, much of it “rightly so, because there are a lot of projects that, for one reason or another, should be scrutinized for certain reasons.”

But he disagrees with the premise that data centers “are bad all the time.”

“Certain areas like this, I feel, are very compelling for data centers,” he says. “Other areas are not. If we can start looking at things on a project-by-project basis … I do think we can find a way to mitigate a lot of the concerns that are out there, if people are willing to have an open mind about it.”

Here’s a look at the plans for the facility so far, some of the environmental issues under discussion, the community’s concerns, and how the developer has proposed to address those concerns in the rezoning conditions.

Electricity usage

There’s no getting around it—data centers are power intensive, and this one especially so with a request for 300 megawatts from Duke Energy (for context, that’s about a third of the total energy output of the nearby Shearon Harris nuclear plant).

Natelli Investments submitted a load study to Duke Energy this spring, and Natelli says the company “feels comfortable” asking for that much power. Transmission lines already exist that could link the property to Shearon Harris, and the developer would pay for any infrastructure upgrades needed.

But residents worry that the massive electricity usage would cause their power bills to surge.

Natelli says the facility wouldn’t be taking power directly or exclusively from Shearon Harris but from several different power plants that serve Duke Energy’s grid, and the utility would figure out how to supply the 300 megawatts incrementally.

“Duke [Energy] … is evaluating the ability for them to serve our requested load, as well as what impacts that load might have on the transmission system, and any upgrades required to the transmission system—the extension of power, the substation, switching stations—we have to bear the cost of all that,” Natelli says. “It’s a very, very big commitment, but it’s a commitment that we’re making, and we’re not pushing that cost … on to other people in Apex.”

But a recent report from Bloomberg found that wholesale electricity costs up to 267 percent more than it did five years ago in areas located near data centers, especially in Northern Virginia and Maryland (where Natelli Investments is based), where data centers are highly concentrated.

“It’s an increasingly dramatic ripple effect of the AI boom as energy-hungry data centers send power costs to records in much of the US, pulling everyday households into paying for the digital economy,” the report states.

In North Carolina, as Duke Energy evaluates its capacity to provide power for data centers planned statewide, there’s a possibility that the state’s Utilities Commission will have to raise rates on all consumers. But the Town of Apex has its own local distribution and transmission rates.

“And we’re not touching that,” Natelli says. “There’s nothing we’re doing that’s going to influence the retail rates that [the town] is charging Apex residents.”

Water usage

Part of the draw of the New Hill site is its proximity to the Western Wake Regional Water Reclamation Facility, a wastewater treatment plant jointly owned by the towns of Apex and Cary that’s situated just a few hundred feet from the property.

With the plant, an 18 million–gallon-per-day facility with a reclaimed water system already on-site, a prospective client would have the option to use nonpotable treated wastewater —between 0.5 million and 1.5 million gallons per day—for cooling inside the data storage facility.

It’s likely the water would only be used for cooling during the hottest months, representatives for Natelli told the EAB, and the new facility could provide on-site storage for the treated wastewater in the case of an emergency.

It’s also likely that an end user for the site wouldn’t require water at all, as some companies have shifted to using air or fluid cooling systems for their equipment.

“A lot of users are moving away from using water altogether,” said Kraig Walsleben, a consultant for Natelli Investments.

If the site does end up using wastewater, about a third of the water used would evaporate during the cooling process.

“We would have to evaluate ecological impacts,” Walsleben said.

Diesel generators

Natelli’s proposal calls for 80 three-megawatt backup generators to be located on the site. Each would be housed inside a tractor-trailer-sized storage container, with a diesel fuel tank stored underneath.

The diesel generators have been a source of anxiety for residents. Burning diesel, a fossil fuel, releases nitrogen oxide, sulfur oxide, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter into the atmosphere.

“Air pollutants are silent killers,” said Michelle O’Connor, a resident of the neighboring Jordan Pointe community, at Apex’s regularly scheduled town council meeting this week. “These particulates are a unique threat as they not only are capable of penetrating lung and olfactory tissues but are small enough to cross the blood-brain barrier. There is no exposure level that is considered safe, just levels that are considered acceptable.”

In their zoning conditions, Natelli pledges to use Tier 4–equivalent generators, which are designed to meet the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s strictest emission standards. They are the most energy efficient and have particulate filters and internal processes to treat emissions, Natelli says.

The generators would all need to be permitted to meet standards set by the EPA and the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality, and they would be used rarely. The facility would be running on higher-voltage-transmission power lines rather than regular residential distribution lines, Walsleben explained, and transmission power lines are less impacted by weather or other emergencies that tend to knock out power.

Noise pollution

For a few of the EAB members, and for some members of the community, concerns over noise associated with the generators, cooling equipment, and other aspects of the data storage facility are some of the most pressing.

Natelli Investments has sought to address potential noise impacts in its rezoning conditions in several ways.

First of all, the company wants to work with the Town of Apex to create a more robust noise ordinance that will provide an objective way to measure noise output and make sure the facility is in compliance.

In addition to doing its own sound evaluations, the company committed at the board meeting to paying for an independent consultant hired by the town to work on sound attenuation and testing measures. Increased setbacks, the company’s representatives said, will also help, as will buffers with vegetation.

“We’re going to implement design measures like berming and landscaping and noise fencing if required,” Natelli told the INDY. “There are attenuation measures that can be built around the equipment. We’re fully committed to doing whatever we need to to ensure that the sound isn’t causing a problem, and it’s at levels that are deemed acceptable.”

He adds that at the property line, the noise could, at 55 or 60 decibels, sound like a normal conversation. The company plans to study how the sound travels to nearby neighborhoods like Jordan Pointe.

“It’ll hopefully put a number of people at ease,” Natelli says.

While the residents in attendance vocally disagreed, it did seem to put the majority of the EAB members at ease. Board member Bill Jensen said the digital campus could provide an opportunity for more Apex residents to work where they live rather than commuting to Raleigh or elsewhere.

“I’ll be frank, I think this property is a decent area for light industrial,” said Jensen before making a motion to approve the rezoning conditions. “‘I’m sorry, I know that’s probably going against the grain, but if you do these things right, and you make a live-work situation, then everybody can benefit. And that’s the critical thing, and that’s what we’re trying to do, is make this thing right.”",https://indyweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-10-16-apex-data-center-eniviro-illo-npm-v3.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 19:03:31.954683

“That is absolutely ridiculous.” Gordon said the federal government and states need to get out of their own way, specifically with permitting new energy projects.
The current Trump administration has promised to bring it back with the attitude of “mine, baby, mine.” However, two recently scheduled federal coal lease sales in the region were a flop.","Republican governors discussed their plan for “Unleashing American Energy” at a recent Montana economic conference.

The panel, which included Wyoming’s Gov. Mark Gordon, Montana’s Gov. Greg Gianforte, Nebraska’s Gov. Jim Pillen and Gov. Puerto Rico’s Jennifer González-Colón, cheered on Pres. Trump’s executive orders that are rolling back federal oversight of industry.

“It's a new day in Washington with President Trump,” said Gianforte, who led the speakers.

The governors highlighted Trump’s efforts to fast track energy projects. For example, some review times on federal environmental assessments have been reduced from one year to 14 days, and for environmental impact statements, it’s truncated from two years to 28 days. This is part of the administration’s dismantling of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). It’s a 55-year-old federal act, often thought of as the Magna Carta of environmental policy, that requires federal agencies to consider and assess environmental impacts of a project.

Gordon also cheered the move to streamline the process. He brought up Wyoming’s TerraPower project, which will be a first of its kind nuclear power plant. The project was announced in 2020.

“It took, let me see, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, independent NEPA analyses between the NRC (Nuclear Regulatory Commission), the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency), and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM),” Gordon said. “That is absolutely ridiculous.”

Gordon said the federal government and states need to get out of their own way, specifically with permitting new energy projects.

“You can regulate by saying, ‘Here's what we would like you to do. However you get there, do it.’ That's cool. That's America,” Gordon said.

Nebraska’s Gov. Pillen said more can be done to get energy projects off the ground. He called for ending the federal permitting process for energy industries, which includes NEPA, citing a Nebraska transmission line project that’s been in limbo for more than a decade.

“We got people that are just continuing to create more roadblocks and roadblocks. We have to end the permitting,” Pillen said. “We gotta steamroll the permitting process.”

However, many conservation groups are raising red flags with Trump’s rollback of NEPA. Earthjustice said NEPA is key for government transparency and accountability, and that actions to dismantle it “fundamentally undermine the public’s ability to participate in federal decision-making processes.”

The governors also discussed the coal market, with an eye toward Montana and Wyoming. The states are home to the Powder River Basin, which is the top producing coal region in the country. The coal market has declined for more than 15 years, even during the first Trump administration. The current Trump administration has promised to bring it back with the attitude of “mine, baby, mine.” However, two recently scheduled federal coal lease sales in the region were a flop.

“We need to get coal leasing out there, and coal companies need to bid more than it costs for a new haul truck for those leases,” said Gordon.

The Montana sale was the first federal sale in the Powder River Basin in more than a decade. But the top bid was for less than a penny per ton. The federal government can only accept bids that are at or above “fair market value” and rejected the bid.

The scheduled Wyoming coal lease sale was postponed without a new date set.

As for generally bringing back economic growth and new energy development, Gianforte said Montana is encouraging it by loosening its tax structure – something opponents have said will only benefit higher income levels. According to Montana Free Press reporting, the Montana Entrepreneur Magnet Act “exempts shareholders of Montana-based businesses from paying capital gains taxes on stock options.”

“Our goal is to get entrepreneurial golden geese to fly here and lay golden W-2 eggs,” Gianforte said.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/66c6a7f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/640x336+0+72/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Flegacy%2Fsites%2Fwpr%2Ffiles%2FOil_well.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 19:03:09.922295

President Donald Trump, on the day he was inaugurated, issued Executive Order 14154, “Unleashing American Energy,” which aims to streamline permitting processes on energy infrastructure development as a matter of national security.

The president’s order directed the Secretary of Energy to immediately resume reviews of all pending applications for LNG export projects to countries without a free-trade agreement with the U.S., reversing a year-long “pause” in regulatory approvals initiated by the Biden administration.

On August 29, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued a final order affirming an earlier determination that the Rio Grande LNG terminal including trains four and five was in the public interest, clearing the last major regulatory hurdle. FERC’s order came about three months before the previously scheduled release date, according to S&P Global.

NextDecade projects the total cost of Train 5 and related infrastructure at about $6.7 billion.

One graph showed the capacity factor at one location for August at , with the year so far showing an average of 14% output.

The concern: shouldn't that number, at least for summer, be much higher?

“Simply powering New York state with solar is just a large waste of land and a large waste of natural resources,"" said meteorology graduate Chris Martz, who is also a member of the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow. ""Because I'm a land conservationist, I think we should have more natural landscape, more national parks. We should preserve that.""

Other farms show similar numbers, like Delaware River Solar, LLC on East River Road. Its capacity from February 2022 to November 2024 for electricity generated.

Martz said a good portion of the year in Upstate New York it can be overcast. He said solar on homes and businesses is a great idea, but large-scale solar projects? Not really. He said the average number for output varies, but seeing an average number in the 20s is about all you'll get at a maximum for our region.

""But on average, it's about 20% to 22% to 26% roughly,"" Martz said. ""That's probably a margin of error there.""

On its best day, he said, solar doesn’t match other energy sources like coal or nuclear.

""Solar power has the lowest power density,"" he said, adding, ""The amount of energy that solar generates is between 5.8 and 11.6 watts per square meter. And then coal power is 26.3 to 105.2, natural gas is 185 to 740, and nuclear fission is 228 to 760 watts per square meter of energy. That's just the power density, so solar is by far the lowest.""

Doreen Harris, president of the said New York actually leads the nation in solar power, producing about 7 gigawatts of combined distribution. She said It’s part of an energy portfolio to create a greener future and ease the energy load, adding solar projects and partnerships in the state can range from small to large-scale.

“We certainly do see a diversity of resources as being beneficial to New York's energy future,"" said Harris, adding, ""We're deploying many different technologies in order to get from here to there from the perspective of a reliable and affordable and clean grid.""

Harris said we will never have the same solar generation as say, Arizona or New Mexico, ""but we've really seen the ways in which this technology can continue to improve and benefit New Yorkers at the same time.""

She said the solar projects are actually a ""huge savings to New Yorkers during the heat waves this summer,” adding the amount came in at about $90 million.

Charlie Remelt owns 100 acres of farmland in Henrietta, and about a quarter of it is dedicated to solar and rented out to a company. As a farmer, he is still able to grow chrysanthemums between the panels, which can shift and move to draw in maximum sunlight. He said farms like his helps feed the strained summer grid.

“Air conditioners, air handlers, running those all draws a lot of lot of energy, and having that supplemental during that time of year is a big plus,"" he said.

Remelt added the town of Henrietta is very forward-thinking when it comes to green energy.

""Their farmland protection (allows) farmers to put solar on their property and generate some extra income to keep the properties from becoming all developed,"" he said.

Harris also said when it comes to solar, it is a major generator of jobs and billions of private investment.

""We have 178,000 clean energy workers,"" she said. ""And when we look at solar development, it's approaching 10,000 of those jobs.""",https://13wham.com/resources/media2/16x9/1105/986/151x98/90/5c474fd0-b7c7-4d4e-9ba7-fe37fedb90b7-AreasolarfarmPhotobyWillMorgan13WHAM1.jpeg,N,,2025-10-17 19:02:58.916928

These jobs aren't just in demand — they're changing lives and providing a pathway for young people to build a future without debt.

Michael Lepinat is a service technician with C&C Heating and Air Conditioning. He says he found his path in the trades after realizing a traditional career just wasn't for him.

""I get to speak with people and work in a changing environment. I'm not stuck behind a desk all day, and I'm presented with different challenges each and every day that I get to overcome,"" Lepinat said.

""Being in a trade has been nothing but great in my life. I wouldn't be who I am today without it,"" Lepinat said.

Nationwide, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce estimates there are over 60,000 unfilled HVAC positions — a gap industry leaders hope young talent can help close.

Justin Coker is the service process manager and maintenance field supervisor at C&C who oversees all of the apprentices. He tells me the company invests heavily in training new talent, often fresh out of high school.

""Every person's a little bit different, but we want to make sure that when we're putting our technicians into people's homes, they feel confident, we feel confident, and the customer feels confident,"" Coker said.

Coker says he knows that journey firsthand.

""I started many years ago as a maintenance technician, quickly worked my way up through service and now into management, and then there's some guys that veer off into more of a sales role. There's some guys that just continue to do service until they retire,"" Coker said.

While many young adults face college debt, Lepinat says the trades offer something different — stability and freedom.

""I can only imagine what it would be like to have hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt and not be able to get a job in the field that I studied for. I know a lot of people that way, family members even that spent years at college and have master's degrees and doctorates, and they're constantly faced with an open job market and not knowing where their next paycheck is gonna come from,"" Lepinat said.

Instead, he found success through hard work and a career that continues to grow.

""You get what you give, and if you want to be the best somewhere, then there is gonna be some hard work and some long hours that you're gonna have to put in, but if it's something that you're truly dedicated to and that you love doing, it's worth it. The sky is the limit,"" Lepinat said.

The EV charging stations will generally be placed no more than 50 miles apart and within one mile of a highway.
The chargers are intended to charge a typical electric vehicle in 30 minutes or less.
Proposals on the 34 charging stations now out for bid are due Jan. 16, 2026.","PHOENIX – Advancing plans to support adoption of electric vehicles, the Arizona Department of Transportation is seeking bids for private entities to build or upgrade, operate, and maintain 34 electric vehicle charging stations along interstate highways 10 and 40, US routes 60, 89, 93, and 160 and state routes 64, 68, 80, 87, 90, 95, 260, and 347.

These bids represent the second phase in a network of rapid-charging stations, following an initial round of charger locations approved in August 2024 for 18 stations along Interstate 10, I-8, I-40, I-17 and I-19. This second phase is another major step toward establishing a statewide charging network that will reduce range anxiety and encourage use of electric vehicles as a viable alternative to gasoline-powered vehicles.

The second phase identifies 31 new locations eligible for EV rapid-charging stations, along with three locations along interstates from the first phase that were not previously awarded. The EV charging network plan is part of $76.5 million in federal funding Arizona is eligible to receive through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program that will construct up to as many as 74 charging stations in the state. The program encourages adoption of electric vehicles by building a nationwide network of publicly accessible and reliable fast chargers that will reduce drivers’ concerns about EV range.

The EV charging stations will generally be placed no more than 50 miles apart and within one mile of a highway. Each location will have at least four 150-kilowatt direct current fast chargers. Beginning in 2025, Arizona will specify that the stations have both the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) North American Charging Standard (NACS or Tesla) and the Combined Charging System (CCS) plugs. The chargers are intended to charge a typical electric vehicle in 30 minutes or less.

All stations will be privately owned and operated, with federal funds covering up to 80% and the private developer covering a minimum of 20% of eligible project costs. No state funds will be involved in the construction of these stations.

Proposals on the 34 charging stations now out for bid are due Jan. 16, 2026. Construction is expected to begin in 2027 and take about one year. Construction on stations approved in 2024 is expected to start by the end of this year.",,N,,2025-10-17 18:03:09.921344

The Montreal-based company said Oct. 9 that final site selection is expected this fall with construction of the facility to begin next year.

The first phase of the project, representing at least a $200 million investment, could remove 30,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide directly from the air per year, it said.

At full scale, the plan is for a facility with annual removal capacity of 500,000 tonnes.

Deep Sky recently began operations of its first facility in Alberta, testing various technologies with an annual capacity of 3,000 tonnes.

“What Deep Sky is building in Manitoba isn’t just one of the world’s largest carbon removal facilities, it’s the foundation of an industry that will reshape our economy and our planet,” said chief executive Alex Petre in a statement.

The province passed legislation last year to allow for carbon dioxide storage, with regulations expected to be passed this fall, the company said.

Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew said the regulatory framework will allow companies to establish in the province and tap into federal tax credits to grow the industry.

“Technology is going to be part of the fight against global warming,” said Kinew, speaking to reporters in Winnipeg on Thursday.

“And if we can create some good jobs and economic opportunity here, at the same time that we are exploring a new technology that might help us in the fight to save the environment … I think we should do that.”

North Carolina's Solar for All program, dubbed EnergizeNC, planned to install at least 43 megawatts of solar energy over five years.","North Carolina and 22 other states are suing the Environmental Protection Agency, seeking to reinstate a $7 billion program meant to help low-income and disadvantaged communities install rooftop solar power systems.

The Solar for All program was created in 2022 by the Inflation Reduction Act, with states and local governments required to apply to receive funds from the program. North Carolina's $156 million award would have helped put solar panels on more than 12,000 homes, according to N.C. Department of Environmental Quality officials.

But in August, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin canceled the program, before states could spend billions of dollars from it.

N.C. Attorney General Jeff Jackson and 22 of his colleagues are arguing the the EPA did not have the authority to cancel the program and rescind funds that had already been appropriated by the U.S. Congress for a specific purpose.

Furthermore, Jackson said, while the EPA pointed to this summer's Big Beautiful Bill as the impetus to slash Solar for All, Congress was clear that it did not intend to rescind Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund money that had already been obligated with that legislation.

""This is a pretty straightforward case from a legal standpoint. I think EPA just decided that they would rather not spend this money, and they're willing to act in defiance of Congress, and we're just going to go to court and point that out,"" Jackson said in an interview.

When EPA canceled Solar for All, North Carolina had yet to receive over $150 million of its fund. Jackson said the state was just weeks away from drawing that money down.

""We had already been awarded the funds. The funds were sitting in an account marked for our state,"" Jackson said.

In an Aug. 8 video announcing that the EPA was canceling the Solar for All program, Zeldin pointed to H.R. 1, the sweeping spending and tax legislation Congress passed this summer.

""But the bottom line again is this: EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive. With clear language and intent from Congress in the One Big Beautiful Bill, EPA is taking action to end this program for good,"" Zeldin said.

Jackson and the other attorneys general contend that Zeldin and EPA are misinterpreting what Congress intended under H.R. 1.

In fact, court filings say, members of Congress were very clear that any Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund awards that had already been obligated should be allowed to continue serving their originally intended purpose. Solar for All was part of that program.

The law itself says, ""Section 134 of the Clean Air Act ... is repealed and the unobligated balances of amounts made available to carry out that section ... are rescinded.""

And when the bill was being marked up before the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on the Environment in May, then-chair Rep. Morgan Griffiths, a Virginia Republican, said, ""These provisions that we are talking about only apply as far, as this bill is concerned, to the unobligated balances. So if a grant was already given, as far as this bill is concerned, then that would still be going forward.""

Impact in North Carolina

If Solar for All moved forward, state officials anticipate that it would help more than 12,000 households install solar panels, helping them save an average of 20% on utility bills. That's worth about $400 on average, according to the Clean Energy Fund of the Carolinas.

The N.C. Department of Environmental Quality also points to the potential for solar panels to be paired with storage systems, providing energy to a home in the case of a prolonged power outage.

""The program’s cancellation would hurt the electric grid’s ability to be resilient to future disasters, and would hamper North Carolina’s efforts to ensure reliable, clean and affordable energy supplies to meet the needs of a rapidly growing population and rising energy demand,"" DEQ Secretary Reid Wilson said in a statement.

North Carolina's Solar for All program, dubbed EnergizeNC, planned to install at least 43 megawatts of solar energy over five years. It would have focused on single family homes, as well as multifamily housing, homes where residents have medical needs and some community solar pilot programs.

""EnergizeNC was primed to deploy a pilot program for home solar and battery backup that would offer back-up power during grid outages for households with medical equipment needs. That battery backup equipment would do double-duty by helping utilities manage the electric grid on very hot or very cold days, when power needs surge,"" Melissa Malkin-Weber, the executive co-director of the Clean Energy Fund of the Carolinas, said in a statement.

The program was also expected to create about 140 jobs in North Carolina, with many of those concentrated in rural areas.

The 23 states challenging the EPA's cancellation of Solar for All filed two separate claims on Wednesday.

In the Western District of Washington, they argued that the EPA 's cancellation of the program violated the Administrative Procedure Act and U.S. Constitution's Separation of Powers Doctrine. States are asking the court to declare the EPA's interpretation of H.R. 1 unlawful and to reinstate the Solar for All program.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f5429f0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4240x2226+0+303/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F20%2Fa4%2Fba587f9d4defab7b23f11fdd3d26%2Fap25183566192370.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 18:02:49.113821

The complaint alleges that the termination of the grant program, Solar for All, contravened the contracts between the EPA and the plaintiffs, stating :

The EPA’s unilateral terminations breached the express terms of Plaintiffs’ Grant Agreements, which allowed for termination only in the narrow circumstances of substantial noncompliance that materially impairs performance, adequate evidence of waste, fraud or abuse, or material misrepresentation of eligibility status—none of which occurred.

The complaint also argues that the EPA breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing by “destroy[ing] Plaintiffs’ reasonable expectations regarding the fruits of their Grant Agreements.” Additionally, in a partner lawsuit filed in the Western District of Washington, plaintiffs allege violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), contending that the termination was arbitrary and capricious.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta reported California’s decision to join the coalition on Wednesday, condemning the grant termination:

At a time when energy bills are at a record high and only continuing to skyrocket, the Trump Administration is needlessly hampering an industry that can produce safe, reliable, and inexpensive energy. Solar for All was built to deliver relief for all Americans — by lowering energy bills for working families, reducing our carbon footprint, and creating high-quality union jobs that would bolster our economy. We will not let this illegal termination of the Solar for All Program stand. This Administration can try all they want to bend the law, but we will hold them accountable.

By February 2025, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) had entered into binding grant agreements with members of each of the 24 plaintiff states. In August, the EPA declared the cancellation of the Solar for All program and began withdrawing funds from the plaintiffs’ accounts. Lee Zeldin, Administrator of the EPA, announced the move on social media, stating:

Welcome to CleanLaw from the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard Law School. I’m Hannah Perls, and in this episode I speak with environmental justice pioneer Charles Lee, former director of EPA’s Environmental Justice Office and principal author of the landmark 1987 report, Toxic Wastes and Race in the United States, and now a visiting scholar at Howard University School of Law. We’re also joined by Sean Moriarty, former deputy commissioner with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.

We discuss the growing field of cumulative impacts analysis and how states are increasingly using this tool in permitting and other programs to advance meaningful protections for overburdened communities across the country. And we should note both Sean and Charles are speaking in their personal capacity and their opinions and views in no way represent the views of their respective institutions. Well, Charles, Sean, thank you both so much for being on CleanLaw.

So a lot of our recent episodes have focused on these big changes to federal environmental law and policy, but today we’re going to shift gears and talk about what I think are some really exciting developments happening at the state level to protect public health and the environment by incorporating cumulative impacts’ analysis into government decision-making and in particular permitting. Now, before we dive in just two to three sentences, what is cumulative impacts analysis and why does it matter? Maybe Charles, we can start with you.

Charles Lee:

First of all, thank you for having me on the podcast. Cumulative impacts speak to the interaction between multiple environmental health and social stressors and their effects on human health, welfare, and quality of life. Cumulative impacts is really about the concentration of environmental and social burdens in certain areas. So places like the Ironbound community in Newark, New Jersey or the South Side of Chicago or Cancer Alley in Louisiana. And it is something that while many communities that are overburdened aren’t familiar with the term, they really know all the issues involved because this really reflects their lived reality.

Hannah Perls:

Sean, is there anything you would add?

Sean Moriarty:

Sure, I would love to add to that, just love adding anything to what Charles says. It’s an extreme pleasure in my life to work with this man. I think the only thing I would add, is that when you’re looking at cumulative impacts from the regulatory perspective, and certainly the way that I come to this, having spent time at New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. I think what cumulative impacts attempts to do is really to account for impacts that are missed when you look at things through traditional media-based permitting approaches. So those media-based approaches, which is, for example, air or water, they’re more narrowly crafted and they look at specific impacts that any given facility has, but they don’t really consider the context in which those facilities exist.

So when Charles mentions the Ironbound community in Newark or the South Side of Chicago or these places, our traditional approach to permitting doesn’t consider the proximity of these facilities necessarily to vulnerable populations and particularly kind of their abundance or concentration in certain areas during permitting. And what cumulative impacts attempts to do is to take a broader view of these things and I think a more complete view of the impacts that facilities have and try to, through some of the various statutory and regulatory approaches that we’re seeing across the country, to try to remedy or remediate some of those disproportionate impacts.

Charles Lee:

So there’s a term that’s always used when people talk about cumulative impacts, which is talking about total burden. And so I think this is what Sean is speaking to. The idea here is to the extent that we can, we want to take into account all those burdens, particularly those that we normally don’t capture, either because of the regulations or because of the way that we currently do the analysis.

Hannah Perls:

I really appreciate that, and I think for a lot of our listeners, they’ll be familiar with the federal frameworks, which often think about pollutants either on a source by source basis or even a pollutant by pollutant basis. And what I hear you both talking about, and I think the way that we all experience pollution in our daily lives where this is sort of intuitive and common sense. We don’t experience just particulate matter and just lead in the water or in lead paint. We experience all of those things collectively. And then the impact will depend on who we are. It might depend on how much money we have. It might depend on our pre-existing vulnerabilities. So this is about taking that holistic view that better represents people’s reality.

And I wanted to pull out something you both said, which is you have the analysis itself that gives you that sense of what people are living in, in terms of the pollution or the background stressors, which we will get into. But then there’s also how you operationalize it. And I think, Charles, this is something that you’ve said that this research must go beyond merely proving existence of disproportionality. So I think a real focus of this conversation is once you have that assessment, how do you operationalize it? And in particular, how do you do that through legal frameworks? And in particular, permitting, which is the real example we have out of New Jersey.

And I do want to just tell our listeners a bit more about who you both are because I am extremely excited to have you both on the podcast given your expertise and experience. Charles, I want to start with you. So you of course are recognized as one of the foremost national experts on this cumulative impacts issue and a longtime participant and leader in the environmental justice movement in the United States. And just for listeners who might not be familiar with your work, you left EPA this year after 26 years with the agency to join the Environmental and Climate Justice Center at Howard University School of Law as a visiting scholar.

And of course, before joining EPA, you worked as an advocate and a researcher, notably as the principal author of Toxic Wastes and Race in the United States, this landmark 1987 report. And you helped organize the First National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit in 1991. And this is an abbreviated biography. Charles, I’m just very, very grateful to you for being on this podcast and sharing your expertise with us. I wanted to ask you, as your decades of work show, this is not a new idea. The concept and assessment of cumulative impacts is ingrained in many of our federal environmental statutes. But I want to know how you started working on this issue and then if there’s anything that you’re seeing now in this moment that feels new.

Charles Lee:

Thanks for the question. I think this issue of cumulative impacts has always been part of the environmental justice conversation. It’s very natural because when we talk about environmental justice, we’re really talking about the lived reality or the lived experience of communities. And so as we said before, we don’t experience pollution one at a time. We experience it holistically. We live with all these pollution and other factors all at the same time. So this is really part of that conversation. So I think at the very beginning of when environmental justice emerged as an issue of national concern, this issue of cumulative impacts just kind of naturally grew up along with it.

For example, the National Environmental Justice Advisory Council, which is EPA’s formal advisory council on environmental justice, had its very first meeting in 1993, the issue got raised. And now virtually in every meeting since then, the issue gets raised over and over again. And just the way that people understand this issue and the ways to deal with the issue has evolved over the several decades that environmental justice has been on the national stage. It is not true that cumulative impacts that we’re just beginning to address this in government decision making. It’s been part of the conversation on that level for many years.

And in fact, going back to around 2010, 2012, California developed a cumulative impact mapping tool that now is used for allocating resources to the areas which are most overburdened. And that’s something that has been done in other states like New York and Illinois and during the Biden administration, that is what the Justice40 Initiative is all about, which calls for 40% of the benefits of a class of environmental and health programs that must go to benefit overburdened communities.

Hannah Perls:

Charles, one thing that you mentioned, I just want to pull out a little bit, is you talked about a lot of different ways that cumulative impacts analysis has been operationalized in state and federal programs. And I think there’s a helpful three-part framework that the Tishman Center at the New School offers, which is they group them into sort of three buckets and you touched on all three buckets, but just to sort of make that clear for listeners. One is this analytical function, just understanding how these disproportionate burdens map out. And so that is sort of what you were talking about with CalEnviroScreen, that mapping tool. Another is this redistributive mechanism, right?

We’re going to use this information to better understand how we can equitably allocate public resources to make sure people who are most impacted get the resources and investments they need. And that would be Justice40. And then I think, Sean, this is a great segue to your expertise. That third bucket is this regulatory operationalizing function where you actually integrate this analysis into how agencies make decisions. And of course, Sean, this is your expertise with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. So I’m going to provide you a brief introduction so our listeners have a sense of who you are and the expertise that you bring.

You, of course, come to this as a former state regulatory lawyer, which is a very specific type of lawyering.

Sean Moriarty:

Yes, it is.

Hannah Perls:

And I think our listeners would also love to hear a bit more about what does that mean to be a regulatory lawyer? But in particular, I think what’s really exciting about your expertise is you were one of the lead attorneys at the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection when the agency was tasked with implementing New Jersey’s landmark 2020 environmental justice law, which included a very explicit and complex cumulative impacts mandate that needed to be integrated into the state’s permitting program. So can you share just a little bit as we flagged, what does it mean to be a regulatory lawyer and then a little bit about that work in particular implementing the EJ law?

Sean Moriarty:

Sure. So first of all, putting my bio up next to Charles’ is kind of insane, right? Charles is going to do a whole book talking about where he comes from, and I can do my entire origin story in about two minutes. So I’m going to do that. So I worked for the state and I would say truly the best thing that ever happened to me in terms of changing kind of a professional trajectory to something that I think is really much more meaningful than what I might’ve otherwise been able to do. So I’d worked for the state for a good decade or so, and I was very fortunate to work my way up through the DEP to become the deputy commissioner and general counsel. And that’s like dream job scenario for me for any kind of regulatory lawyer.

You think that that’s unattainable in your little space and then you get a couple of lucky breaks and you find yourself in a position of great privilege honestly. So early in my tenure in that job as deputy commissioner, I was asked to take part in this meeting with community members from the Ironbound Community Corp on an issue. It was related to environmental compliance reviews for facilities eligible for renewable energy credits. At the time, did not think it was that big of a deal, to be honest with you. So met with staff, we prepared our fairly standard response, which if you’ve ever dealt with government, it’s probably not going to be all that fulfilling when you hear it.

And went to the meeting thinking that this would be kind of my typical interaction with advocates who’ve dealt with people repeatedly over the years and felt like I had a sense of what to expect. Very quickly realized that was not the case. So after giving kind of the department’s response, one of the community members, I’m not going to name her, but she’s very well known and a very powerful voice in this space, immediately and forcefully told me that I should be fired. And if you’ve never thought you were doing your job and thought you were doing it well, and then were told very directly that you did not deserve to sit in that position, I would recommend it because it really pushes you back and it makes you have to reconsider why you’re there.

So while that wasn’t the first time, and definitely not the last time I’d been yelled at as a state worker, this was different, right? There was an urgency and kind of, I don’t even know what the right word is, a power behind those words.

Hannah Perls:

That sort of moral imperative.

Sean Moriarty:

I wasn’t prepared for that, and I hadn’t felt that in these meetings before. So perhaps initially just out of self-preservation, we regrouped, we changed our tune, and went back to the drawing board on this. And over the next several months we worked to find what I felt was a better solution. But ultimately we were much more transparent, much more open about what our constraints were, what we could do, what we couldn’t do. And I think we found better common ground on the issue. And luckily for me, I kept my job. So what I took from that were really two lessons. First, that the department can and should do better in these spaces.

And secondly, that in my position, instead of just getting the information and delivering it, I had the ability to influence better outcomes. So while I’ve never confirmed that this is the case, I’m pretty certain that my handling of that issue was at least part of why our then commissioner, Catherine McCabe, came to me and said, “I think you need to be the person to handle this rule making process.” When the state environmental justice law was passed. So with those lessons, we began this process of engagement, and a big part of that process was a continuous and direct conversation with the community members and advocates who had championed the bill. This was their law.

They had worked they decades to get it passed. And I think that’s part of thinking about how we can do things better and how we can do things differently, was to talk to them directly every two weeks for the entirety of our rulemaking process. And in our first meeting, which was fun times during the height of COVID, so all this is happening on the computer. I just went in and just openly admitted that I am probably somebody who looks a lot like the people you interacted before that you felt let you down. And what I would never do in that situation is I would never ask them to trust me because that would not work. So what we committed to, I specifically and the rest of our team, is that we would work to earn their trust through this process.

And to make this slightly long story, slightly shorter, we got the rules done and the person who wanted me fired some five years later, we now count each other as friends, and we’re still trying to find ways to collaborate together. And to me, if you’re a regulatory lawyer in this space or any other space, I think the lessons there are at least pretty clear to me that you’re going to get a lot farther by being transparent, by being genuine, by being real with folks, letting them know what you can and can’t do, and ultimately working to earn that trust as opposed to just sitting there and being a bureaucrat. And I think that type of approach that we adopted as a department is really what helped us to be able to be successful in putting this rule together, in getting it adopted, and ultimately working on the implementation.

And I think that was a big deal for me. It really kind of changed the way that I approached all of this, and then I quit DEP and then Charles came calling and said, “Hey, let’s do some more of this work together.” And I said, “Yeah.” And I made a bunch of changes and now we’re here doing this podcast. So it’s all pretty cool.

Hannah Perls:

I think that’s another good universal rule. If Charles Lee asks you to do something, you do it.

Sean Moriarty:

Yes. The answer is always yes.

Hannah Perls:

The answer is always yes.

Charles Lee:

Can I add something to that?

Hannah Perls:

Absolutely.

Charles Lee:

So as part of the process that Sean led was a stakeholder engagement process that was, I think, in my mind, not just excellent, but really educational. And so they did a number of stakeholder meetings, which are recorded, and on the New Jersey DEP website, there’s a whole encyclopedia of all the recordings and you hear the advocates. And these were not just advocates, but the communities and other stakeholders all engaging with Sean and other members of New Jersey DEP over really substantive issues. And what you listen to if you listen carefully, is how these issues are worked through, not just in terms of what’s important to the communities involved, but what is practicable under the kind of laws and regulations that DEP has to work with.

So it is really an educational thing. And what I think I would draw from that is this has been this conversation in the environmental justice space about how environmental justice is not just a procedural matter, it has been to a large extent, still happening in many cases, is that government agencies would just hold a meeting and then they would check the box. There’s this is Fourth Circuit opinion about the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, where it basically says environmental justice is not a check-the-box exercise. And so moving beyond that to addressing these issues substantively is I think the heart of what the New Jersey DEP process is all about.

And I think that stands as a real hallmark as far as something that’s truly valuable that this whole process brings to good governance and to transparency and meaningful involvement.

Sean Moriarty:

Thank you for highlighting that, Charles. So I would always tell people, if you’re a glutton for punishment, you can watch all those videos because it’s a full day’s worth. I’m not joking, 24 hours of just my bald floating head talking about environmental justice stuff. But in all seriousness, I think that comes back to this idea that in doing this work, it’s okay to approach things differently, that it deserves a better approach. It deserves more because we’re trying to correct longstanding historical inequities. And that you can’t do that by just using the same approach and the same modus operandi that you always use. It has to be different. It has to be focused. If we’re going to talk that talk, we had to walk the walk.

So we did eight months of stakeholdering with everybody. We broke it down piece by piece, every single decision that we made there. And it didn’t mean that we were going to just do what everybody told us to do, but what we were going to do is sit there and take the time to explain exactly why we felt we wanted to move in a different direction, get feedback on that, present proposals. So before the rule was ever proposed, before things were finalized, everyone involved in that process had a really, really clear and strong understanding of what the rule was going to say. There were no surprises when the thing came out.

Charles Lee:

One thing maybe to add to that is that what I found really helpful for me was the idea that those conversations were really problem-solving conversations. That the whole way that the development of those regulations was approached was that it was a trying to solve problems and not just solve problems alone, but collectively.

Hannah Perls:

We’ve just been saying and using the words disproportionality, burden, stressors. And one thing this law is really trying to get at is the historical legacy of often governmental choices that decided where polluting facilities would be sited or decided where we would invest public dollars to build out sewer or wastewater infrastructure. And each state has its unique context, not just in terms of its current industrial mix, but also the particular communities that were excluded from democratic processes or excluded from the benefits of environmental decision making.

And so Charles, obviously, as one of the people who first documented this in that 1987 report, I was wondering if you could just talk a bit about how you understand disproportionality and why it’s so important that we not just understand it, but operationalize it in the way we make decisions now.

Charles Lee:

Thanks for that. I mean, I think one of the things that 1987 Toxic Wastes and Race report did was to really bring evidence to bear about this idea that environmental burdens and benefits, that there’s a distributional aspect to that. And this has been built upon in the 40, 50 years since then with a whole explosion of research. I mean, there’s probably thousands of peer reviewed journal articles in all aspects related to environment, health, sustainability, climate and transportation, healthcare, green space. And as you pointed out, it also offers us a way to understand not just what is, but how it got there.

So a great example of this would be the issue of redlining in the 1930s and all the research that’s being done ever since the University of Richmond digitized the redlining maps in the 1930s and the research that began to correlate our current environmental and health conditions with what grade you were in terms of the 1930s HOLC Maps, H-O-L-C, redlining maps.

Hannah Perls:

That was the Home Owners Loan Corporation, H-O-L-C?

Charles Lee:

That’s right. Home Owners Loan Corporation. And so it’s really remarkable to see that areas which were deemed the worst or the least desirable areas that ended up being areas where we disinvested in are the places that have the highest asthma rates or the greatest temperature rise. There’s heat islands and lack of tree cover, and these relationships really help to explain why current environmental conditions are the way they are today. And I think that the larger question behind all this is that in our environmental analysis and decision making process, we really need to think more about the distribution of environmental benefits and burdens.

Hannah Perls:

So I want to get to what that final product is because now we sort of built up and built up and built up all the anticipation.

Sean Moriarty:

Excitement is off the charts.

Hannah Perls:

This is a very extended movie trailer for the New Jersey DEP rules. And I want to start to dig into the complexity of the really concrete decision points that the regulators made as part of this engagement process. And I should say that, Sean, you and I and another one of our colleagues, Sarah Hart-Curren, we are working on a forthcoming legal guide that will just lay out the legal considerations for integrating cumulative impacts analysis into state permitting. So we’re not going to get into sort of the science and methodology of cumulative impacts analysis. There are a ton of really amazing resources. A lot of this is Charles’s work and his colleagues like Paul Mohai and others.

I want to talk about the legal framework. So if you’re a regulator and you’re starting from the authorizing statutory language, right? The New Jersey legislature says to New Jersey DEP, “Do this thing.” Sean, can you talk a little bit about what you saw as sort of the crucial decision points in designing this program and how you as a regulator look at statutory language and come out with a rulemaking process that as you said isn’t just process for process’s sake? It’s going to deliver concrete protections consistent with what the legislature demanded.

Sean Moriarty:

Sure. That sounds great. What the law kind of requires is it requires the department to consider how certain specific facilities operating in what we call overburdened communities, and those are set by specific demographic criteria, are going to contribute to environmental public health stressors in a way that is, as we term it, disproportionate when compared to what I would say is its neighbors, right? So what you’re doing is you’re looking at environmental conditions in specifically identified communities and trying to figure out if they are worse essentially than other communities. And what it allows you to do is consider those impacts on a facility-wide basis as opposed to the kind of more narrow way you would look at it.

If you’re looking at it from an air pollution perspective, you’re looking at stack emissions, or if you’re looking at it from water pollution perspective, you’re looking at a point source emission. This allows the department to consider things much more broadly on a facility-wide basis. And that lets you get at things that you can’t otherwise get at through traditional environmental permitting structures, particularly trying to address mobile sources and their impacts on PM2.5, diesel particulate matter. Some of these things that really affect quality of life in overburdened communities that we didn’t have the tools to really address previously. So when you ask what the big decision points are, the statute gives us some guidance.

It tells us what facilities to look at, largely solid waste facilities, major air sources. It tells us what communities to consider. We need to figure out, “Well, first and foremost, how do you do that in comparison?” And we do so by defining specific environmental and public health stressors. So we had a list from the statute that includes concentrated areas of pollution, mobile sources, sites, and then other things that may cause, being a critical term “may cause,” public health impacts, including asthma, cancer, elevated above levels, a bunch of things, right? We needed to be able to plot those out with data for the entirety of the state. So we had to look at a bunch of different data sources.

We started with 60, we ended with about 26. 26 pieces of data that would inform those statutory categories, those statutory stressor categories. Our goal in doing so was to use as much publicly available and kind of reliable data as possible, feeling that that would give us a more objective baseline upon which to begin to evaluate facility contributions. And setting that baseline is really, really important to ultimately determining whether just proportionality exists. So we created through that process the Environmental Justice, Mapping, Assessment, and Protection Tool or EJMAP.

And what that does is ultimately plots out the relative stressor levels for all of the communities in the state of New Jersey, the overburdened communities and non-overburdened communities, and then allows us to do a comparative analysis of those stressors between communities. And then for any of those individual stressors where the presence in an overburdened community is higher than it would otherwise be in a non-overburdened community, those are considered “adverse.” We’re able to sum those up through what we call the matrix method. So you could take each of the individual stressors, you can make a determination about whether they are higher than what you would see in non-overburdened communities.

And then you add those up and that gives us kind of an overall assessment of disproportionality across all of those communities. That’s the biggest and most crucial decision point. From there, what we really ask of facilities is to simply address their contributions to those stressors, particularly where they’re disproportionate. So through that process, you have a baseline assessment, you have an assessment of disproportionality, the department does all that work, makes that available, and then a facility comes in, and they have to make decisions about what they are or not going to be able to do to address their contributions.

In that way, I think it takes a fairly complex concept and makes it pretty simple and something that based on a chart that you can pull down from EJMAP, you can really understand exactly what the environmental conditions are in a particular community. And as a facility or as a community member, then you can start to make decisions on how you can work to lessen those areas of disproportionality or adversity. I think it’s a really, really powerful way to look at it and data being really the backbone and the critical component to that. That really unlocks a lot of the other aspects of the law that ultimately can work to lessen those impacts.

Hannah Perls:

Sean, I just want to emphasize one more part of the New Jersey program, there’s really crucial clear statutory language in the New Jersey law that requires New Jersey DEP to deny a permit if certain thresholds are met. So if you could imagine a community where you have an elementary school and there’s a facility that’s already there and it wants to expand and expanding that facility would mean that that community bears a much higher disproportionate pollution load cumulatively. New Jersey under the law, the DEP now has very concrete mandates about what to do in that situation. So I was wondering if you could briefly explain how that works.

And then Charles, I’m going to ask you why we don’t just copy and paste the New Jersey law for all the other 49 states.

Sean Moriarty:

So I think one of the aspects of the law that is important to understand is the difference in authorities with regard to denials. So the original version of the bill, and this is probably one of the reasons why you don’t just cut and paste it because you maybe could do a little bit better. But the original version of the bill would’ve had mandatory denials when you are causing a disproportionate impact. So impacting a community in a way that is going to make it have disproportionate burdens or is going to further exacerbate existing and disproportionate burdens. That was changed.

And the way that the law works now is that the department only has the authority and in fact has the mandate to deny permits for new facilities that are going to cause disproportionate impact unless they will meet the compelling public interest standard. So for those facilities, if you are seeking to site a new facility in the community you described, that’s already subject to significant adverse burdens, unless the facility can completely avoid contributions to those adverse burdens, it is denied unless it meets compelling public interest standard and that’s drawn narrowly. It focuses on really kind of critical public health or environmental needs of the community.

And I think when you’re thinking about critical statutory terminology when, in the definition of compelling public interest, it specifically uses the words “in the overburdened community.” I think that we highlighted that, we underlined it, we put it in different color every time we did a presentation because when you’re scoping out what that looks like, centering the needs of the community is absolutely critical to avoid continued kind of exacerbation of historic inequities.

Hannah Perls:

I think we’ve been using a lot of big terms, but I think this is fundamentally a public health bill. And when we talk about denying new facilities, it is a recognition that that contribution would dramatically impede people’s public health. Is that accurate?

Sean Moriarty:

Without question. We talk about reality, we talk about lived experience, all that stuff. It’s like what is it like to go outside your house? If you live in some of these communities that are considered overburdened that we’ve kind of mapped out and have not only meet specific demographic criteria but also have increased environmental and public health burdens. You might be walking outside of your house and you might see diesel trucks going to the nearby solid waste facility the entire day and how that impacts your quality of life.

They might technically raise particular levels of a particular pollutant, but at the end of the day, it’s like what does that feel like to live there and can we do better to make it so when people walk outside the air that they breathe is cleaner and that the water that they find around the corner in the stream is not incredibly dirty and all of the things that some of us are fortunate enough to take it for advantage. So you deny those facilities when it’s going to further impact the quality of life. For existing facilities, and one of the changes to the bill is that the department can only condition those permits.

So if an existing facility or that facility that is next to the elementary school that’s expanding, they effectively under the law have a right to expand. The department in turn has a right to impose additional conditions on that expansion that are intended to, and we set this out in the regulations. We set a hierarchy of avoidance, minimization, and in certain situations, net environmental benefit that requires a facility to go through and assess its impacts to those stressors and look at all feasible ways that they can avoid those impacts. And if they can’t avoid them, then they need to minimize them.

And if you’re expanding, then you need to do something else for the community to try to address the fact that an expansion that increases contributions to public health stressors, we are accepting that that is going to increase a level of disproportionality. So in that situation, what the rules ask is that if we’re going to accept that and we are going to agree that you can do that, then we’re going to ask you to do something else to try to reduce elsewhere because we can’t get around the fact that you’re adding. And to us, and to me, that was critical because you got to think about what the goals of the law ultimately are.

Preventing new facilities is a good and laudable goal, but how you deal with those existing facilities to me is just as critical because if you’re going to improve conditions over the long term, you’re ultimately going to need to reduce the contributions from those facilities. And that’s what we really sought to do through the regulatory process, is to drive those down at each renewal iteration or each expansion to try to minimize as best we could what those impacts would be. And hopefully over the long term see significant lessening of that documented disproportionality.

Hannah Perls:

I should say, it’s not prevent all new facilities, it’s preventing facilities that have negative public health consequences in areas that already are experiencing significant public health burdens and making sure that we don’t make it even worse, if that is fair.

Sean Moriarty:

That is very fair.

Charles Lee:

When I was at EPA and we would bring Sean over to present under New Jersey DEP’s regulations and methodology, and all the attorneys at EPA would say, one thing about this that really stands out in my mind. They called it, it was an approach that was elegantly simple, that it was really easy to see and to implement. To me one of the things that… It doesn’t have to be that complex. That you could do it in a way that’s legally and scientifically defensible and be very straightforward. So I think that’s one thing that we take away, lessons from what happened in New Jersey, that would be one of them in terms of what kind of tool or what kind of analysis method that we’re striving for that it’d be elegantly simple.

Sean Moriarty:

And I think on that point, so this is a cumulative impacts titled podcast. When Charles describes what that means, he talks about interactions of chemicals and how that affects inherent or population-based vulnerabilities. I think it’s important to distinguish what we did in New Jersey in our now called matrix approach from a true cumulative impacts analysis. It is not that. It does not attempt to account for the interactions of those chemicals in the air or in the water. It does not attempt to necessarily account for how those specific mixtures of chemicals will affect folks based on their vulnerabilities.

All it does is attempt to look at, we talked about this earlier, what is the reality of environmental and public health conditions in a particular community? And then it works to try to address those. So one of the big points of pushback in earlier department efforts to try to address cumulative impacts and ultimately was hanging over the idea of actually passing a bill in 2020, was whether you could actually do this. Because at that time, and things have advanced, and there’s reports coming out even yesterday showing how it kind of a true cumulative impacts analysis that work is advancing. At the time, now five years ago, there were people who could credibly say, “You actually can’t do this.”

And if you can’t do it, then what’s the point of passing a law that says you should? And what we were able to do, and I’ll give a lot of credit to folks like Steve Anderson, Sherry Driver who worked at the department for years and years and years on this work, quietly behind the scenes in their extra time. When we were negotiating the bill, they were able to show proof of concept on these things. They were able to say, “We know where all these facilities are and can plot them out based on this demographic criteria. We can show you that most of your major air facilities are concentrated in very specific places.”

And I think that the work that you do to carefully consider the data, carefully consider how you want to quantify these things, is really important in how it will ultimately be translated into regulation, into operation.

Hannah Perls:

You mentioned a report that came out yesterday. So we’re going to link to the report that just came out from the National Academies on cumulative impacts analysis, which we should say Charles played a part in. Charles, we’ve been talking about a lot of concepts that you’ve pioneered and I want to lift those up. So one piece I think as we look at other states that have adopted cumulative impacts programs or have bills moving through their legislature, and there’s a significant number. We have I think eight states that have cumulative impact requirements in their permitting program specifically, and then an additional 10 states that have bills moving that would adopt a similar framework.

And I think a common question is, well, why don’t we just copy and paste the New Jersey bill? And the response is this “fit for purpose” framework that you’ve pioneered. And so I just want to have you explain that a little bit. What does that mean and what are the different decision contexts that people should think about when they’re trying to apply this framework to their particular situation?

Charles Lee:

Thanks for that. I’ll try to do a good job on this.

Hannah Perls:

And I will say, to your research, I’m asking you to explain a lifetime of work in five minutes.

Charles Lee:

Well, first of all, I mean this idea of fit for purpose, I think it has been in the public health environmental analysis literature, it’s been in the risk assessment literature. And I came across it when I was thinking about how the environmental justice analysis has come about and evolved. And so I guess you can define this as that different types of decisions may require, probably will require different types of analysis, different types of data, different combinations of quantitative and qualitative analysis, different degrees of quantification to inform them. And what we want to do is not just to do an analysis for its own sake, but to inform decisions. So the analysis should be tailored to the decisions that we’re trying to make.

And so in the environmental justice space, when we first started to develop EJ mapping tools like CalEnviroScreen and US EPA’s EJSCREEN, we did this with the idea of just trying to identify places where you can go to do more outreach or analysis, and we never thought of it as something that can be used for any purpose other than that. And then what happened in California was that a law was passed as Senate Bill 535, that called for 25% of the proceeds of the greenhouse gas reduction fund in the state to benefit what they call disadvantaged communities. And CalEPA decided to use CalEnviroScreen to make those determinations.

And for me what that meant was that some of these tools that we originally developed that we didn’t know could be used for these type of purposes, it turned out that these tools can in fact be used for making very impactful decisions like where you allocate resources. And in California that has amounted to billions of dollars that goes into the communities where they are most in need, the most overburdened, and underserved communities. And that of course has been replicated in other states and became the approach behind the Justice40 Initiative during the Biden administration. But the kind of tools that are going to be necessary for a more regulatory context like permits or rules are probably going to be different.

And we’re seeing these emerge now with New Jersey DEP’s approach in terms of its cumulative impacts and methodology. Again, in the context of your question, different states are going to have different kind of statutory language, and out of that, you’re going to have to develop methods and regulations to suit those statutory goals. I think it’s fair to say that in Massachusetts the approach is somewhat different. It’s much more of a threshold-based, risk-based approach that’s based on health endpoints. And so we don’t need to get into all of that, but that is just to say that there are different approaches emerging even in the permit space.

And I think when we get to national rules, the kind of analysis, the scaled analysis, and the kind of data that’s going to be necessary, and the kind of questions you’re going to have to answer are going to be different. So it’s important to note that cumulative impact analysis is not just one thing, and the key to understanding how to make it so that it is practicable is to understand the decision context and to understand that you can tailor your analysis to suit those decision contexts. So there is a conversation that took place when EPA went to the Science Advisory Board, and I think this is back in 2021, 2022.

When around the recommendations, the Office of Research and Development’s recommendations around cumulative impacts research, and the members of the SAB all said, “This is a really laudable exercise.” But that it was nearly impossible except for one person, Dr. Kristi Pullen Fedinick who said, “It may seem that way, but actually if you start to understand the idea that you have decision context and you can tailor analysis to various decision contexts, then it becomes something you can get your hands around.”

Sean Moriarty:

I’m in love with Charles’s fit for purpose approach. When you think through the different implications of practicality, defensibility, all those things, and how different approaches, single score method out of California, or matrix method out of New Jersey, or risk-based thresholds out of Massachusetts, all of those are valid ways to do this. They all come with different risks, different practicalities, and you can kind of see when you plot them out on that fit for purpose continuum, you can see how they fit together and how they can be used to advance different but at times maybe concurrent priorities.

The other thing about… joke, of course, everybody’s should copy New Jersey because I’m from New Jersey, but I think it’s just important to know every state has communities that have specific needs and specific concerns. So there may be some broad validity to the idea that the approach we took in New Jersey can be kind of operationalized and used other places. But at the end of the day, what this requires, if we’re going to really address cumulative impacts, and we’re going to address these quality of life issues that we’re talking about, is you need to understand the specific types of stressors that are of concern in the communities within your given state, municipality, wherever.

And you need to understand what the types of facilities that are most of concern. So I wouldn’t cut and paste our list of facilities to everywhere else because I don’t think that would be valid, but I do think there are parts to this. There are principles at play that can be useful, but ultimately those things got to be crafted, I think, to meet the needs of the communities. And I think that will have better outcomes, but we can offer perspective and understanding of the tools that are available to folks to try to get at those outcomes.

Hannah Perls:

There’s a menu and you can sort of lay out what’s on the menu and then folks can sort of pick a la carte, what makes the most sense for them in their state.

Charles Lee:

Because the whole point of all this is not just to do the analysis, but it is to utilize them in terms of better decisions.

Sean Moriarty:

And on that menu, how those things interplay is important too. You might not want to select pineapple on pizza because that’s disgusting.

Hannah Perls:

Wow, hard take.

Sean Moriarty:

But those things might be great in other contexts, just maybe not combined all the time.

Hannah Perls:

It’s a very specific take. We might get our first hate mail from people who love Hawaiian pizza. So thanks for that, Sean. As we flagged this is a really exciting and sort of quickly moving tool in terms of seeing states in particular operationalize cumulative impacts analysis in their permitting programs. And so the last question I want to ask you both is if someone is coming to you saying, “We’re really excited about this idea. I’m living in X State, where do I start?” Or they’re coming to you to say, “I’ve looked at New Jersey’s program, I understand it, but I’m trying to figure out what am I not seeing? What am I missing?”

Are there any resources or people or ideas that you would want to make sure you point them towards as they go about this process?

Sean Moriarty:

I think some of the work that Charles has been doing, and I’ve been fortunate to work in collaboration with him on, it’s like trying to build a community of practice around this work and bringing together people with the experience and the perspectives and the understanding and how you define these issues, how you advocate for these issues, and ultimately how you operationalize permitting solutions in the long term. I think that approach is really, really critical to anybody who’s interested in this. If somebody came to me the first thing, I would want to make sure that either they were from the impacted communities or we’re speaking with them. I think that’s the first part.

This has to be driven by folks in those communities. You got to first start there, identify the concerns, and talk to folks and have them drive the bus on this. But I think the work that we’re doing now is to try to create a support system for folks who are on that bus and who want to see these things in their state. And I think you look at the work we did in New Jersey, you look at the work they did in Massachusetts, or look at the ongoing work in New York, Minnesota, Connecticut, you can see how these things are playing out. Everybody’s in different stages. Everybody has slightly different statute, slightly different approach, but all kind of aimed at the same goal of reducing these disproportionalities.

I think by engaging with those folks, by talking to them, by understanding what’s happening in other states and taking advantage of the resources, I think that can help to provide folks with the tools that they need to engage in this conversation, to answer the pushback that they’re going to get, to understand where folks are going to be uncomfortable, and try to figure out ways in which you can craft something that for your communities and in your particular political environment will be workable and move forward. I’ve started to believe that at least personally, having data is really, really critical to being able to identify and demonstrate this issue.

Folks have said, “Well, how do you get the agency to understand?” I would say, “Go for a walk, go out and walk around communities and understand what you’re actually regulating.” That’s one piece. But beyond that, I think having data available, having mapping in some case might be really useful as a first step to be able to demonstrate to folks that there actually is a problem. And then you have the tools available through these other approaches to begin to really address that.

Hannah Perls:

The Tishman Center just released a new dashboard that has a map where you can actually scroll through all the different state laws, rules, and then the bills that are moving. So we’ll make sure to link to that dashboard as well because it’s a really fantastic and easy to use resource. But Charles, I want you to have the last word.

Charles Lee:

I just wanted to build off of what Sean said. It is really important to be in touch with communities around an issue like this. I mean, I found that the interest in this issue, as communities become more aware and more developed in terms of their thinking about how to address these environmental justice and environmental injustice concerns, that cumulative impacts is really rising to the fore. And so it’s important to keep in touch with that. In that context, Sean said it, you can say it in another way. Communities have to be in the lead of the conversation and that we have to really tailor what we do based upon what they think are important, what their aspirations are, and how they want to see these types of issues become addressed.

In that context, we’re seeing this is no longer an area where there’s just a lot of activities. We’re beginning to see scholarship begin to emerge. There’s enough practice now to say that we can begin to understand the contours of what the solutions may look like. And so examples of that are you mentioned the New School’s Tishman Center, has developed a database that catalogs all the new policy on the state level and is a database that’s being added to on a daily basis. So that’s a great resource. Professor Paul Mohai, Megan Cunningham, who was a former deputy commissioner for the Chicago Department of Public Health, and I are co-editing a special issue of the Environmental Justice Journal on cumulative impacts and government decision-making.

That is going to be published in December, and it has 17 articles in it. So we could see that there’s a wide amount of, not just interest, but emerging scholarship and of course yesterday’s release of the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine report on the state of the science and future of cumulative impact assessment.

Hannah Perls:

There’s a lot of resources, a lot of homework for folks. But I think, Sean, just to bring back that community of practice idea, and I think Charles, to your point about the emerging scholarship, it’s not just that people are publishing these things in a bubble. There is a real collaborative community of folks who want to get this right. And so I’m just very grateful to you both for including me in that community, frankly. But I think also just for being willing to have this conversation and share this work, and hopefully this can be a resource for folks as well. So most importantly, thank you for all your work, but also thank you for being on CleanLaw today.

Charles Lee:

Thank you.

Sean Moriarty:

Thank you, Hannah. And thank you to all the folks at DEP who helped me get to this position where I get to have these really fun conversations with folks like you.

The grid upgrades would ease the flow of electricity in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, and West Virginia. The project, which will address lines owned by American Electric Power (AEP), won’t add any new routes, but it will help existing ones carry more power.

AEP is one of the largest utilities and transmission line owners in the U.S., with operations spanning 11 states. The 5,000 miles that will be upgraded represent around 13% of the company’s total network.

The loan guarantee was initiated under the Biden administration just days before President Trump was inaugurated. Previously, the Trump administration has cited approvals occurring between Election Day and Inauguration Day as justification for canceling projects.

It’s unclear what distinguished this grid modernization project from others that the Trump administration is considering canceling or in the process of canceling.

In Minnesota, the Department of Energy is moving to cancel a $467 million grant that would have helped unlock 28 gigawatts of new generating capacity, most of which would have been solar and wind. Another in Oregon would have issued $250 million in grants to connect half a dozen renewable projects.

But the largest transmission project the Trump administration wants to axe is a $630 million grant to modernize California’s grid. In many ways, it’s similar to the AEP project, looking to wring more out of the existing grid to ease congestion. As planned, the California project would test advanced conductors and dynamic line rating devices, both of which would allow old rights-of-way to carry more electricity. That’s frequently a cheaper option than building new power lines.

The AEP project will also rewire the lines with new conductors. The loan guarantee will allow the utility giant to secure a lower interest rate, saving the company at least $275 million, which it says will benefit its customers.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright said that the loan will “ensure lower electricity costs across the Midwestern region of the United States.” Already, the states included in the project have among the lowest electricity rates in the nation.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/critical-infrastructure.jpg?resize=1200,675",N,,2025-10-17 18:02:42.727815

Patrick Pouyanne, CEO of longtime QatarEnergy partner TotalEnergies, told the forum that he had spoken to European Commission Director-General for Energy Ditte Juul Jorgensen about CSDDD and the EU's pending methane regulations.","The flow of US LNG to European markets could be upended unless the EU quickly throttles back its new methane limits and corporate reporting regulations, top industry executives warned this week.

The bloc’s Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) and related methane standard approved in May 2024 are “the worst, most irresponsible piece of legislation I've ever seen passed anywhere in the world,” Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods told delegates at the Energy Intelligence Forum 2025 in London.

The methane regulation extends to all producers, exporters and importers wanting to sell gas into the region, with importers required starting this year to report annual methane emissions data — including from countries and companies exporting to the EU.

Starting in 2030, EU gas importers must demonstrate that volumes entering the bloc comply with a yet-to-be-determined methane intensity limit, with hefty fines expected for noncompliance.

Similarly, financial penalties are expected to be issued for noncompliance with the CSDDD, which sets out sustainability reporting rules covering companies operating in the EU or doing business within it.

The EU is under intense pressure to scrap or drastically modify the regulations, which take effect Jan. 1, 2026, if it hopes to continue importing LNG from the US, which industry executives say can’t possibly comply with the stringent requirements.

The US is the largest exporter of LNG to Europe, shipping an average of about 160,000 tons per day so far this year. The US has accounted for 56% of the bloc’s LNG imports so far in 2025.

The EU is currently working on amending the CSDDD through the commission’s Omnibus Simplification Package, with Brussels having already announced that it is aiming to postpone the entry of CSDDD until 2028.

‘Sell Them Less’

Woods said Exxon is “supportive” of the human rights element of CSDDD but slammed the decarbonization element, as it requires plans that are “consistent with the objectives of the Paris accord, which today are unachievable with the existing set of technologies.”

The CEO also raised concerns with CSDDD’s requirement to reduce the emissions of its global customers, suggesting that the only way Exxon could do that would be to “sell them less.”

“And it requires us to do that, not only in Europe, but everywhere we operate around the world. … That, from my standpoint, is untenable,” Woods said.

Woods stressed that the industry is working to reduce pollutants on its own and isn’t opposed to reasonable government oversight. “Regulations that are overly prescriptive or unrealistic or that, frankly, aren't practical and can't be implemented in the short term — I think those are areas that the industry pushes back against,” he said.

‘I Appreciate the Intent’

Woodside CEO Meg O’Neill told the forum that she has no objection to the EU’s intent on being a “global leader in tackling climate change” and agreed that tackling methane emissions is “good business.”

“Why would you let a molecule that can be constructively used be emitted?” said O’Neill, whose Australian-based company owns the Louisiana LNG export project under construction on the US Gulf Coast.

However, O’Neill said the EU had “fallen short in a couple of areas,” including the complex approach it has taken with its energy policy and the proposal to impose financial penalties on companies failing to adhere to the methane regulation.

O’Neill said the legislation stands to inflate already expensive energy prices in Europe and that European industry “is going to be destroyed.”

""I appreciate the intent, but I'd encourage the European lawmakers to be thinking about unintended consequences because this would have, I think, disastrous ramifications across the continent,” O’Neill concluded.

‘Completely Uncompetitive’

ConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance echoed the sentiments of Woods and O’Neill, warning that US LNG producers will increasingly turn to Asia if these provisions remain in effect as adopted.

“[CSDDD] is going to make Europe completely uncompetitive. … We'll bypass Europe and go to Asia and to other parts of the world. It's that significant,” Lance told forum delegates.

But Lance said he is hopeful that “sanity” will prevail in the CSDDD conversation and that people will “move in a more constructive path.”

The Qatari Factor

The US isn’t the only major LNG supplier threatening to turn away from Europe. Qatar, the EU’s third-largest LNG supplier behind the US and Russia, has warned it will stop sending LNG to the bloc should sustainability-focused regulations take effect as adopted.

Qatari Energy Minister and QatarEnergy CEO Saad al-Kaabi has vehemently objected to the CSDDD if it faces financial risks for noncompliance. ""Put simply, if further changes are not made to CSDDD, the State of Qatar and QatarEnergy will have no choice but to seriously consider alternative markets outside of the EU for our LNG and other products, which offer a more stable and welcoming business environment,"" al-Kaabi wrote in a letter to the EU in May.

QatarEnergy owns 70% of the $10 billion Golden Pass LNG export terminal, with Exxon owning the remaining 30%. The companies expect the 18.1 million ton per year (2.5 billion cubic feet per day) Texas facility to begin operating by year’s end, with most offtake currently targeting Europe.

Patrick Pouyanne, CEO of longtime QatarEnergy partner TotalEnergies, told the forum that he had spoken to European Commission Director-General for Energy Ditte Juul Jorgensen about CSDDD and the EU's pending methane regulations.

“I told her, look, you need to make pragmatic things,” Pouyanne said, highlighting the complexity of measuring methane emissions in the US, where gas for LNG plants is generally sourced from the grid — meaning it is hard to pinpoint its origin.

Last month, Jorgensen said she was confident the commission can and will ""implement the methane regulation in a way that doesn't constitute an irritant in any way.”",https://energyintel.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/71ff191/2147483647/strip/true/crop/750x394+0+53/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fenergy-intelligence-brightspot.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2F4f%2Fd9%2F99fa1f0d404ca4635b7a687a0613%2Fss-2259427737-regulation.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 23:06:53.552429

In a groundbreaking move, Orlando has joined Boston, Detroit, Los Angeles, and San Francisco in launching new non-stop flights from the US to top destinations like Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Spain, and France. These new non-stop flight routes are set to revolutionize the American travel industry, making international travel faster, more convenient, and more accessible than ever before.

As Orlando becomes a key player in this exciting development, the new non-stop flight route enhances the options for American travellers eager to explore Canada’s cosmopolitan cities, Australia’s beautiful beaches, New Zealand’s stunning landscapes, Spain’s rich history, and France’s iconic landmarks.

With more direct connections, the US travel industry is poised for a major transformation, enabling millions of Americans to experience the world with fewer stops and faster access to some of the most sought-after international destinations.

In 2025, outbound travel from the United States is undergoing a major transformation, which is new non-stop flight routes from many American cities. With new nonstop flights from key US airports to some of the world’s most popular destinations—Spain, Germany, Canada, France, Italy, Australia, and New Zealand—travellers can now reach their favourite holiday spots more conveniently than ever before.

These new direct routes offer American travellers an incredible opportunity to explore international destinations while saving time and energy. Whether for business, leisure, or adventure, these nonstop flights are a game-changer in global travel.

Direct Flights from US Airports to Spain: Connecting Florida, New York, and Beyond

Spain continues to be a top travel destination for Americans. With its stunning beaches, rich culture, and vibrant cities, it’s no wonder that more nonstop flights are being added. New non-stop flight routes in 2025 are making it even easier for Americans to explore Spain.

One of the most exciting additions is the new nonstop flight between Orlando (MCO) and Madrid (MAD), starting on October 26, 2025. Iberia will operate this service four times a week, giving travellers from Florida a direct link to Spain’s capital. This route is expected to be hugely popular, especially with tourists seeking a quicker and more affordable way to reach Spain.

In addition to Orlando, Boston (BOS) has become a major hub for nonstop flights to Spain. JetBlue is expanding its services to Barcelona (BCN), with a daily direct flight, operating until October 25, 2025. This addition offers Boston-based travellers more flexibility when visiting the lively Catalan capital.

Nonstop Connections from US Airports to Germany: Expanding Travel Between the US and Europe

Germany, with its rich history, art, and vibrant cities, is another popular destination for American tourists. Several new nonstop flights from US airports are connecting passengers directly to Frankfurt (FRA) and Munich (MUC) in 2025.

One of the key new routes is the Detroit (DTW) to Munich (MUC) nonstop flight launched by Lufthansa. This service enhances the connection between the US and Germany, particularly for travellers in the Midwest, and offers an additional gateway to explore Germany’s business and cultural hubs.

Another exciting addition is the San Francisco (SFO) to Frankfurt (FRA) route operated by United Airlines. This new nonstop service is perfect for travellers heading to one of Europe’s financial powerhouses, ensuring that passengers can easily access the bustling city without any unnecessary delays or layovers.

These direct flights, along with additional services from other airports like Chicago (ORD) and New York (JFK), are making it even easier for American tourists to experience all that Germany has to offer.

New Nonstop Flights from US Airports to Canada: Quick Access to North America’s Neighbour

Canada is just a short flight away for most Americans, and new nonstop flights are making travel even more accessible. From San Antonio (SAT) to Toronto (YYZ), Air Canada is now offering a direct route that adds more options for travellers from Texas to Canada’s largest city. This flight, launched in May 2025, makes it easier for travellers to visit Toronto for both business and leisure purposes.

Another exciting new service is the Columbus (CMH) to Montreal (YUL) route, which is set to launch in May 2026. Although this route is a bit further down the line, it’s a huge step forward for connecting Ohio to Canada’s French-speaking hub.

In letters to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, Merkley and Pingree criticized the agency heads for continuing to put public health and public lands at risk while failing to fulfill the mission of the agencies. As senior members of the Senate and House Appropriations Committees, the leaders are carrying out critical Congressional oversight.

“The Agency’s ongoing failure to provide complete information and to work transparently with Congress is unacceptable. As a reminder any reorganization, reprogramming, or funding change is subject to the jurisdiction of the Appropriations Committee,” write Merkley and Pingree, respectively Ranking Members of the Senate and house Interior-Environment Appropriations Subcommittees.

“Decades of institutional knowledge and scientific expertise have been lost and are in further danger of being eroded. Losing staff with specialized training in toxicology, water quality science, and cumulative impact assessment is not efficient and does not achieve mission-critical goals like protecting Americans from environmental hazards, regardless of administration. These are not abstract bureaucratic concerns; these are matters of quality of life, cost of living, and public health,” the Ranking Members told EPA Administrator Zeldin.

In a second letter to Interior Secretary Burgum, Merkley and Pingree press the Secretary to respond ahead of reported RIFs coming as early as next week. Merkley and Pingree pointedly criticize the agency’s attempts to reorganize several offices without providing responses to questions from the subcommittees and its delay in scheduling briefings as required.

“Mr. Secretary, every dollar of funding, every reorganization, every reprogramming, and every funding change or transfer is the direct jurisdiction of Congress and specifically our Committees. The Committees did not receive any notifications, materials, briefings, or other information about this major change – or any of the previous major personnel changes – in order to evaluate it,” write Merkley and Pingree to Interior Secretary Burgum. “There is simply zero justification for the drastic staffing cuts that have already been implemented, let alone another RIF.”

“A staffing loss of this level would cripple our ability to appropriately manage public lands on behalf of the American people, meet tribal treaty and trust responsibilities, and respond to growing threats of wildfire across the landscape and in our communities,” Merkley and Pingree add. “Decades of institutional knowledge were destroyed in a matter of months and are in further danger of being eroded. Losing staff with expertise and experience is not efficient and does not achieve mission critical goals.”

Interior Appropriations Subcommittee Ranking Members Merkley and Pingree cite the critical function of the Interior workforce, many in public-facing roles such as park rangers, refuge staff, and recreation specialists on public lands that span 500 million acres in all 50 states and U.S. territories. Additionally, RIFs would delay Tribes from getting their funding from self-governance contracts.

Wrapping Up Toyota's pivot to mass-producing solid-state batteries is the culmination of its long and deliberate EV strategy.
Born from a deep-seated caution about the limitations of current battery technology, this move is a bold attempt to redefine the electric vehicle landscape.","For years, Toyota, the titan of the automotive world, has been viewed as a reluctant participant in the all-electric vehicle revolution. While competitors raced to launch new battery electric vehicles (BEVs), the Japanese giant seemed to be dragging its feet, earning criticism from environmental groups and EV enthusiasts alike. But a recent announcement signals a potential paradigm shift in its strategy, a high-stakes bet that could either redefine the market or cement its status as a laggard. In early October, Toyota announced a joint venture with Sumitomo Metal Mining to mass-produce cathode materials for solid-state batteries, with plans to launch cars featuring this breakthrough technology by 2027 or 2028. This isn't just an incremental update; it's a potential game-changer. Solid-state batteries promise to be a holy grail for EVs, replacing the flammable liquid electrolyte in current lithium-ion batteries with a solid material, offering higher energy density for longer range, significantly faster charging times, and enhanced safety.

Toyota's Calculated Hesitation

To understand the gravity of this move, one must first understand Toyota's long-standing skepticism towards a BEV-only future. The company that pioneered hybridization with the Prius has consistently advocated for a ""multi-pathway approach"" to decarbonization. For years, Toyota executives argued that a premature rush to all-electric vehicles was misguided. They pointed to several valid concerns: the high cost and environmental impact of battery production, the strain on global mineral supply chains, the lack of robust charging infrastructure in many parts of the world, and the fact that hybrids still offered a more immediate and accessible way for the masses to reduce emissions.

Instead of going all-in on BEVs, Toyota diversified its bets, continuing to refine its world-leading hybrid systems, developing plug-in hybrids (PHEVs), and investing heavily in hydrogen fuel cell technology, as seen with its Mirai sedan. This cautious strategy was often interpreted as stubbornness or a failure to innovate. In reality, it was a pragmatic, if conservative, calculation. Toyota was unwilling to commit its vast manufacturing empire to a technology it viewed as immature and fraught with logistical hurdles. They were waiting for a breakthrough that aligned with their core principles of reliability and mass-market viability. Solid-state batteries appear to be the breakthrough they were waiting for.

A Silver Bullet Against China's Dominance?

Toyota's timing is critical. While it has been cautious, Chinese automakers, led by giants like BYD, have stormed the global EV market. China now dominates the EV space, not just in sales but in the most critical component: the battery supply chain. Chinese companies control a huge portion of the mining and refining of essential minerals and are leaders in producing cost-effective and increasingly popular LFP (lithium iron phosphate) batteries. For Western and Japanese automakers, competing with China on the current lithium-ion playing field is a daunting uphill battle.

This is where Toyota’s solid-state strategy could be a stroke of genius. Instead of trying to catch up in a race they are already losing, they are attempting to change the race entirely. By successfully mass-producing solid-state batteries, Toyota could effectively ""leapfrog"" the current generation of EV technology. A Toyota EV in 2028 with a 600-plus-mile range that can recharge in minutes would represent a monumental advantage over any vehicle on the market today. It would shift the competitive benchmark from battery cost—where China excels—to technological superiority in performance, safety, and convenience. This move is a direct challenge not to match China’s current strengths, but to render them obsolete with a next-generation standard.

Is It Too Little, Too Late?

The multi-billion-dollar question is whether Toyota can pull it off in time. A 2027-2028 launch window feels both tantalizingly close and perilously far away. By then, competitors will have nearly a decade of experience in building and marketing EVs. They will have refined their software, built out their charging networks, and secured their own supply chains for current-generation batteries. Furthermore, lithium-ion technology is not standing still. Advances in battery chemistry and cell design are continuously improving energy density and charging speeds, potentially narrowing the performance gap that solid-state batteries promise to create.

Toyota is in a high-stakes race not just against other legacy automakers like VW and Honda, who also have solid-state ambitions, but against the relentless pace of incremental innovation. If production delays push the launch to 2030 or beyond, or if the cost of the technology remains too high for the mainstream market, Toyota's gamble could backfire spectacularly. In that scenario, they would have squandered precious years while their rivals solidified their positions in the defining automotive transition of our time. The company is betting the house that its technological leap will be significant enough to erase its late start.

Wrapping Up

Toyota's pivot to mass-producing solid-state batteries is the culmination of its long and deliberate EV strategy. Born from a deep-seated caution about the limitations of current battery technology, this move is a bold attempt to redefine the electric vehicle landscape. It serves as a direct counter-offensive to the market dominance established by Chinese manufacturers, aiming to shift the battleground from cost to next-generation performance. Whether this proves to be a visionary masterstroke or a desperate, delayed entry will depend entirely on execution. If Toyota can deliver a reliable, affordable solid-state EV by 2028, it will not only have caught up but will have positioned itself to lead the next phase of the electric era.

Summary: Toyota's plan to mass-produce solid-state batteries by 2028 is a high-stakes gamble to leapfrog current EV technology and challenge China's market dominance, but its success hinges on delivering the breakthrough on time and at a competitive cost.

Renewables, such as solar and wind, will surely feature in Africa’s future energy mix. However, larger energy base loads and more stable and economically efficient energy sources are needed to support the digitization, industrialization, and urbanization underpinning Africa’s economic growth.

While the will for nuclear energy clearly exists, African countries face various challenges in developing nuclear energy sources. First, large-scale powerplants cost billions, mostly in upfront investments, which many governments cannot afford. Additionally, many countries lack the expertise to support the engineering, operational, and regulatory functions involved with nuclear energy. Lastly, nuclear energy requires extensive infrastructure—both “hard” infrastructure to support nuclear facilities and an expanded electric grid, as well as “soft” infrastructure, consisting of the necessary regulatory and institutional frameworks.

Russia has positioned itself as a global leader in the nuclear energy market, including in Africa. The Kremlin is an attractive partner thanks to its comprehensive aid package, which includes generous financing options, educational training, and infrastructure support, all easily accessible through the state-owned energy company Rosatom.21 African countries have signed nuclear cooperation agreements with Russia in the last decade, including at least eight proposed or in progress large-scale nuclear power plants. The Kremlin is also pursuing uranium mining deals in Africa to increase its grip on the nuclear energy market, with the continent holding 20 percent of global uranium reserves.

China is increasingly exporting its expertise. Beijing has rapidly expanded state-backed “nuclear” or “green” Belt and Road initiatives abroad, including in Africa, despite not offering any public nuclear energy financing in Africa from 2012 to 2021. Of the six African countries that have reached at least phase two of the IAEA nuclear development milestones, China has deals with four—Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa.In 2024, China held its first China-Africa Forum on the Peaceful Use of Nuclear Technology in Ethiopia and it would hold future fora as part of its 2025-2027 Beijing Action Plan.

Chinese and Russian dominance in the nuclear sector will translate to long-term partnerships and leverage. Beijing and Moscow are securing decades of influence due to the long timelines and wide-ranging scope of nuclear energy projects. Energy also equates to leverage. African countries relying on Chinese- or Russian-backed energy projects or fuel may feel compelled—or be coerced—to align with China and Russia on sensitive topics to protect their economies and overall national security. Moscow has weaponized energy reliance against the West since it invaded Ukraine.

The United States is also missing out on substantial business opportunities by failing to prioritize the energy sector. Africa’s energy sector is one of the fastest-growing sectors on the continent. US companies were involved in over $25 billion worth of deals and had another $20 billion in upcoming projects at the beginning of 2025.

Critical mineral supply chains are also intertwined with energy infrastructure. US energy investments can help establish the energy infrastructure needed to support mineral production and entice greater mine development, securing US mineral access in the process.

The advent of micro and small modular reactors presents an opportunity for the United States to get back into the game. SMRs are better suited for many African countries due to their cheaper up-front cost and better compatibility with smaller energy grids. Their modularity also makes them more resilient to supply chain disruptions and better able to be safely deployed in a wider array of locations, such as rural areas and energy-intensive economic sites.

Fortunately for the United States, SMRs are better suited to American strengths than larger power plants. SMRs are much more compatible with private investment and innovation due to their lower cost, modularity, and potential for mass production. Large-scale power plants, on the other hand, suit China’s and Russia’s state-owned nuclear energy enterprises and the vast sums of public funding they bring to bear.

The United States already has many of the resources it needs to ride the wave of the SMR revolution. The United States has invested billions into developing SMRs over the last decade, and the Trump administration re-approved $900 million in funding to support the domestic SMR development as part of President Trump’s initiative to “unleash” American energy and quadruple nuclear energy production.

The Trump administration has also supported efforts to export this technology through continued support for the FIRST program, a government initiative to leverage public-private partnerships to support partner countries with training and capacity building, regulatory support, and procurement for SMRs. FIRST supports American companies and have already helped the United States secure deals to develop SMR technology in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, and Rwanda.

Still, the United States will be in fierce competition with China and Russia. Russia has deployed its first floating SMR domestically and is negotiating deals to export the technology to coastal African countries. China and Russia have both developed their first land-based SMRs and signed deals with South Africa and Zimbabwe, respectively, to eventually export SMR technology.

Given this position, the United States must focus on scaling up its efforts. Financing will remain a key issue, and joint funding arrangements—both for Western developers and African buyers—should be a focal point. The United States should work with its allies to help co-develop and co-finance SMR exports to Africa. Such partners include Argentina, Canada, Japan, and South Korea, all of which are FIRST contributing members with already-existing projects in Africa.

The United States’ engagement with Africa’s regional economic and power blocs will be critical. Africa has eight regional economic blocs and five regional power pools, which support cross-border electricity trading. Engaging these blocs will generate joint funding for multi-country projects. For SMRs, this could take the form bulk orders, which would make SMR exports more financially viable for private companies. Regional energy investments will also support other regional infrastructure, trade, and investment opportunities, including in the critical mineral sector.

Another financing option, public-private partnerships, are becoming increasingly viable. Development finance institutions such as the World Bank and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development have become more willing to fund nuclear energy projects in recent years. This shift will hopefully be mirrored by African and other international funding institutions that have avoided nuclear energy funding.

To support these various initiatives, the United States and its African partners should make better use of comprehensive tools already at their disposal—the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) and Power Africa. For African countries, AfCTFA will help mobilize capital to invest in regional public-private partnerships and make it easier for countries to export surplus energy, both of which encourage the scaling of energy projects. AfCTFA will also enable African countries, especially those in the FIRST program, to become leading partners with the United States in further spreading nuclear technology and expertise on the continent without trade restrictions. For US companies, AfCFTA has the potential to create a more unified market and regulatory system across national borders, further enabling bulk orders and making it easier to work with multiple countries.

The Trump administration should restore funding to Power Africa, a program clearly aligned with the President’s energy initiatives that was, unfortunately, collateral damage during the 2025 DOGE cuts. The program had incentivized more than $80 billion in commitments from other private and public funding streams since 2013, resulting in an added 14.3 gigawatts of electricity and a more than tenfold return on its funding. Renewing Power Africa would secure more joint funding, public-private partnerships, and support other de-risking tools­—such as loans and loan guarantees—to drive US investment.

African countries have identified nuclear energy as a promising energy source, and the United States should listen to its African partners. African countries do not want to be beholden to Beijing or Moscow, but Washington must offer competitive alternatives. The United States is well-positioned to do so with the advent of SMRs, but it must make better use of its tools to scale its current efforts.

Workforce & Training Infrastructure

Lee County’s workforce ecosystem, coordinated by CareerSource Southwest Florida and Florida SouthWestern State College, provides logistics and mechatronics programs tailored to automation roles. The region’s labor shed reaches into Collier, Charlotte, and Hendry Counties, ensuring a sustainable pipeline for both technicians and operations specialists.

Real Estate Readiness

The 143-acre parcel—formerly zoned for light industrial use—was already equipped with key utilities, making it a “speed-to-market” location. The county’s streamlined Development Review Committee (DRC) process trimmed permitting cycles by roughly 35%.

Power & Infrastructure Reliability

Florida Power & Light (FPL) committed to upgrade substation capacity and extend dual-feed reliability for Amazon’s automation demands. Given that power availability has emerged as the number-one site-selection filter (per SEDC 2025 survey), this assurance sealed the location advantage.

3. Regional Economic Impact

A 2025 analysis by Florida Commerce projects:

$1.2 billion in total economic output over 10 years (direct + indirect + induced)

$56 million in new annual wages across logistics, construction, and services

$15.8 million in annual state and local tax revenue once operational

According to Holly Smith, Lee County Commission Chair:

“This investment positions Southwest Florida as a logistics innovation hub. We’ve diversified beyond tourism and construction into advanced, resilient industry.”

Local officials also note collateral benefits: increased demand for warehouse space, trucking, EV charging infrastructure, and smart-grid projects.

4. Florida’s Logistics Renaissance

Amazon’s announcement is part of a broader Florida logistics expansion wave that includes:

Wal-Mart’s new e-commerce DC in Cocoa (Brevard County)

Publix cold-chain expansion in Lakeland

PortMiami and PortTampa Bay dredging and automation projects

Space Florida’s freight-aerospace synergy initiatives

Together, these signal a state-wide repositioning toward automated logistics, AI integration, and energy-efficient operations.

According to FloridaCommerce’s 2025 report, logistics now accounts for 1 in 8 Florida jobs and contributes $56 billion annually to state GDP.

5. Inside Amazon’s Robotics Strategy

The Path to Full Automation

Amazon’s fulfillment network has evolved through five generations of robotics integration:

Kiva-based mobility (2012–2016)

Automated storage & retrieval (2017–2019)

Vision AI for sortation (2020–2022)

Autonomous mobile robots (Proteus, Sequoia)

Hybrid human-machine collaborative workflows (2024 onward)

The Lee County facility will operate on Generation 5 — where machine learning orchestrates robot fleets and human workers supervise “exceptions.”

Sustainability Edge

Amazon plans to install a 7-MW rooftop solar array, deploy 100 % EV yard tractors, and recycle 98 % of construction waste. The company also signed an MOU with FPL SolarTogether to offset grid emissions through renewable credits.

Research Collaboration

The company is partnering with Florida Gulf Coast University’s Innovation Hub to develop talent pipelines in robotics, automation software, and AI logistics analytics — a first for Southwest Florida.

6. Incentives & Public Support

Although Amazon typically relies on limited incentives, local sources confirm a package that includes:

Qualified Target Industry (QTI) tax refunds of up to $2 million (performance-based)

Infrastructure assistance under Florida’s Job Growth Grant Fund (~$4 million for road and utility upgrades)

Local property tax abatement phased over 10 years

Training reimbursements via CareerSource Florida

Economic Development Director John Talmage summarized:

“We structured a package focused on workforce and infrastructure — not giveaways. Amazon’s long-term commitment and the talent ladder we’ll build are the real wins.”

10. Key Takeaways

Strategic Location: Lee County’s logistics corridor and readiness gave Amazon a “plug-and-play” advantage.

Automation Economy: AI and robotics integration define the next decade of distribution.

Workforce First: Strong talent pipeline was essential — not just land cost.

Energy Reliability: Power capacity is the new currency of site selection.

Community Synergy: Early collaboration between EDOs, utilities, and educators proved decisive.

(P&GJ) — The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects North America’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) export capacity could more than double by 2029, driven by major U.S., Canadian, and Mexican terminal expansions now under construction.

According to EIA data and trade reports, total North American LNG capacity is expected to rise from 11.4 Bcf/d in early 2024 to 28.7 Bcf/d by 2029 — with the United States accounting for nearly 14 Bcf/d of that growth. The region’s expansion represents more than 50% of anticipated global capacity additions through the end of the decade.

United States: Gulf Coast Expansion Leads Growth

U.S. additions are concentrated along the Gulf Coast, already the world’s largest LNG export hub. Several large-scale projects — including Port Arthur LNG Phase 1, Rio Grande LNG, Woodside Louisiana LNG, Golden Pass LNG, and CP2 Phase 1 — have reached final investment decisions and are under construction. Combined, they will add more than 10 Bcf/d of new capacity.

Plaquemines LNG and Corpus Christi Stage 3 began shipping cargoes earlier in 2025 but have not yet reached commercial operations. Pipeline infrastructure remains a key constraint, as new projects are needed to deliver gas from producing basins to coastal terminals.

Canada and Mexico Add West Coast and Floating Capacity

In Canada, LNG Canada shipped its first cargo in mid-2025, marking a milestone for the nation’s first LNG export facility. The project’s two trains will produce up to 1.84 Bcf/d, with a second phase planned to double capacity after 2029. Additional projects under construction include Woodfibre LNG (0.3 Bcf/d) and Cedar LNG (0.4 Bcf/d), both sourcing feedgas from the Montney Formation.

CHICAGO (October 17, 2025) – This week, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) began removing hazardous waste from the former Glycerin Traders facility at 3522 South State Route 104 in La Porte, Indiana. EPA estimates the work to remove hazardous waste will be completed this fall, weather dependent.

More than 700 containers of liquid waste are stored at the property, the contents of which are unknown. Labels on some containers indicated the potential presence of hydrochloric acid, organic peroxides, and potassium nitrate. Containers of acids, oxidizers, and flammable oxidizers were observed on pallets. Many containers of hazardous chemicals are in poor condition, open, corroded, or bulging. The improper storage of the chemicals could result in a release of hazardous substances into the environment or a fire, leading to EPA’s swift action to remove the immediate threat to public health and the environment.

EPA will identify the waste, and consolidate, package and remove any hazardous substances off-site for proper and safe disposal. Air monitoring will be conducted during the cleanup to ensure cleanup activities on-site do not impact air quality off-site. Nearby residents may notice increased vehicle activity in the area and workers in personal protective equipment.

Background:

Glycerin Traders operated as a waste-materials refining and processing facility between 2010 and 2024. The facility historically received waste oils, acids, flammables, solvents, and unknown materials to be processed into usable products. Indiana Department of Emergency Management (IDEM) found Glycerin Traders in violation of numerous Resource Conservation and Recovery Act waste management practices. IDEM requested EPA assistance to assess whether the site met the criteria for a time-critical removal action from the agency in April 2025.

More information about the response is available at the Glycerin Traders removal website.

A total of 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable, the Energy Department said.
Electric utilities that receive loans through the program must provide assurances to the government that financial benefits from the financing will be passed on to customers, the Energy Department said.
Wright, in a conference call with reporters, distinguished the AEP loan guarantee from a $4.9 billion federal loan guarantee the department cancelled in July.
The loan guarantee to AEP was among those conditionally approved under Biden, a fact Wright acknowledged to reporters.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Department of Energy said Thursday it has finalized a $1.6 billion loan guarantee to a subsidiary of one of the nation’s largest power companies to upgrade nearly 5,000 miles of transmission lines across five states, mostly in the Midwest, for largely fossil fuel-run energy.

AEP Transmission will upgrade power lines in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia to enhance enhance grid reliability and capacity, the Energy Department said. The project, first offered under the Biden administration, is meant to help meet surging electricity demand from data centers and artificial intelligence.

Ohio-based American Electric Power, which owns AEP Transmission, is one of the nation’s largest utilities, serving 5.6 million customers in 11 states. It primarily produces electricity from coal, natural gas and nuclear power, along with renewable resources such as wind and hydroelectric power.

Thursday’s announcement deepens the Trump administration’s commitment to traditional, polluting energy sources even as it works to discourage the U.S. from clean energy use.

Earlier this month, the administration cancelled $7.6 billion in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election. A total of 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable, the Energy Department said.

The cancellations include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub aimed at developing clean-burning hydrogen fuels to power ships and heavy-duty trucks. A hydrogen project costing up to $1 billion in the Pacific Northwest also was cancelled.

The loan guarantee finalized Thursday is the first offered by the Trump administration under the recently renamed Energy Dominance Financing program created by the massive tax-and-spending law approved this summer by congressional Republicans and signed by President Donald Trump. Electric utilities that receive loans through the program must provide assurances to the government that financial benefits from the financing will be passed on to customers, the Energy Department said.

The project and others being considered will help ensure that Americans “will have access to affordable, reliable and secure energy for decades to come,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement.

“The president has been clear: America must reverse course from the energy subtraction agenda of past administrations and strengthen our electrical grid,” Wright said, adding that modernizing the grid and expanding transmission capacity “will help position the United States to win the AI race and grow our manufacturing base.”

The upgrades supported by the federal financing will replace existing transmission lines in existing rights-of-way with new lines capable of carrying more energy, the power company said.

More than 2,000 miles of transmission lines in Ohio serving 1.5 million people will be replaced, along with more than 1,400 miles in Indiana and Michigan serving 600,000 customers, the company said. An additional 1,400 miles in Oklahoma, serving about 1.2 million people and 26 miles in West Virginia, serving 460,000 people, will be replaced.

The projects will create about 1,100 construction jobs, the company said.

The loan guarantee will save customers money and improve reliability while supporting economic growth in the five states, said Bill Fehrman, AEP’s chairman, president and chief executive officer. “The funds we will save through this program enable us to make additional investments to enhance service for our customers,” he added.

Wright, in a conference call with reporters, distinguished the AEP loan guarantee from a $4.9 billion federal loan guarantee the department cancelled in July. That money would have boosted the planned Grain Belt Express, a new high-voltage transmission line set to deliver solar and wind-generated electricity from the Midwest to eastern states.

The Energy Department said at the time it was “not critical for the federal government to have a role” in the first phase of the $11 billion project planned by Chicago-based Invenergy. The department also questioned whether the project could meet strict financial conditions required, a claim Wright repeated Thursday.

“Ultimately that is a commercial enterprise that needs private developers,” Wright said. The company has indicated the Grain Belt project will go forward.

Trump and Wright have repeatedly derided wind and solar energy as unreliable and opposed efforts to combat climate change by moving away from fossil fuels.

Sacramento (USA) - Demand for zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) in California is soaring, despite efforts by the Trump administration to hinder the Golden State’s pursuit of a 100% clean energy future. In the third quarter of 2025, 29.1% of all new car purchases were ZEVs - a new record.

As California Governor Gavin Newsom announced, Californians bought 124,755 zero-emission vehicles between July and September. Despite numerous setbacks caused by the Trump administration, California is making its direction clear: electric vehicles are the future.

Record EV Sales in California

“This is unprecedented - we’re nearing a third of all new vehicles sold in the fourth largest economy on the planet being clean cars,” said Governor Gavin Newsom. “ We’re setting new records because this state believes in innovation, not isolation. While Trump sells out American innovation to China, California will keep charging ahead on our path to a future of cleaner air.”

Nancy Skinner, Commissioner of the California Energy Commission (CEC), added: “This is a defining moment for California’s ZEV progress and sends a clear message to Washington: ZEVs are here to stay.” She emphasized that the work and investments of the CEC and its partners in expanding the state’s charging network have paid off, with almost every Californian now living within 10 minutes of a fast-charging station.

Skinner’s message is clear: “Now, new EV owners can enjoy a great driving experience bidding goodbye to smelly gas stations, messy oil changes, and costly engine tune-ups.”

Lauren Sanchez, Chair of the California Air Resources Board, added: “ While the federal government stumbles backward with reckless rollbacks and short-sighted policies, California charges ahead lighting the path to a cleaner, more prosperous future. From pioneering clean transportation in the 1970s to becoming the world’s 4th largest economy today, we’ve proven time and again that protecting air quality and the climate isn’t just the right thing to do, it’s smart economic policy.”

Diversity and Growth in the ZEV Market - Expanding Charging Infrastructure

The zero-emission vehicle market is becoming increasingly diverse: in Q1 2025, 146 ZEV models were available, compared to 105 the year before. Of the 124,755 ZEVs purchased in Q3, 108,685 were battery electric vehicles (BEVs) - another all-time high. Compared to Q2 2025, EV sales increased by nearly 30%. Consumer confidence in both the technology and the infrastructure is visibly growing.

California is the first U.S. state to implement binding reliability and reporting standards for public charging stations, improving the performance of publicly funded fast chargers and ensuring greater transparency across the state charging network.

On October 8, 2025, the California Energy Commission (CEC) approved the construction of 64 new fast chargers along key highway corridors under the NEVI program, helping to reduce range anxiety. Grants were also approved for the repair of 30 existing and installation of 30 new fast chargers. Three additional grants totaling over $10 million will fund the construction of more than 1,000 Level 2 chargers, primarily in multi-family housing for low-income and underserved communities.

Low-income Californians are also eligible for thousands of dollars in grants and rebates when purchasing a ZEV. The state is cutting red tape and prioritizing infrastructure development in hard-to-reach regions.

One Million Charging Points - The Gold Standard for American EV Infrastructure

While state funding programs continue to boost ZEV adoption, driving electric vehicles is becoming increasingly practical in everyday life. California now has over 200,000 publicly accessible charging stations, located at supermarkets, park-and-ride facilities, gas stations, apartment complexes, workplaces, clinics, and sports venues. This is complemented by around 800,000 private home chargers, a crucial factor for widespread EV adoption.

Both lawsuits filed against the agency accuse the EPA of illegally revoking money promised under the Solar for All program without congressional approval.

Solar for All was established in 2022 with the Inflation Reduction Act, which granted $7 billion in federal funding to help lower-income families access solar panels and battery storage programs. The program was expected to save participants an estimated $1,740 annually on their utility bills. After President Trump took office in January, Solar for All grants were largely frozen. In August, the EPA formally terminated Solar for All, citing President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. According to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, the EPA did not have the authority to administer the program or the appropriate funds to keep the program running.

The first lawsuit pushing back against the EPA’s cancellation of Solar for All came earlier this month when a group of plaintiffs comprised of solar energy companies, labor unions, and homeowners filed a lawsuit in Rhode Island accusing the EPA of ending Solar for All in violation of federal law. The plaintiffs assert the program was expected to secure 4,000 megawatts of new solar energy over five years, generate 200,000 new jobs, and would have helped save energy costs. Their complaint also accuses the Trump administration of attempting to recapture “billions of congressionally approved dollars in climate funding that was approved during the Biden administration.” The plaintiffs are seeking an injunction and for the EPA to reinstate the Solar for All program.

The latest lawsuit was filed Oct.13 by Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee. Harris County, which is comprised of Houston and the surrounding area, is contesting the cancellation of more than $400 million in solar energy grants earmarked for Texas-based organizations. Menefee’s complaint claims that the One Big Beautiful Bill Act did not give the EPA authority to cancel Solar for All grants as those funds had already been legally committed to the program. The complaint further asserts that the EPA’s cancellation of funding “jeopardizes the county’s ability to deliver critical infrastructure promised to create thousands of well-paying jobs, protect residents from extreme whether by reinforcing the county’s electrical grid, and reduce energy costs for tens of thousands of low-income households.”

The lawsuits are not the first to challenge the EPA’s termination of Biden-era climate grants. There have been numerous lawsuits filed since President Trump took office challenging the EPA’s termination of federal funding awarded through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF), most notable, Climate United Fund v. Citibank. In April, the District Court for the District of Columbia in the Climate United Fund Matter issued a preliminary injunction that prevented the EPA from effectuating GGRF grant terminations while the litigation was pending. In September, however, an appeals court set aside the preliminary injunction in its entirety, stating that “the grantees are not likely to succeed on the merits because their claims are essentially contractional,” asserting that the claims must be brought before a special court that handles contract disputes involving the federal government. The grantees are appealing that decision and proceeding with litigation.

The Climate United Fund matter is one to watch as more entities file suit against the EPA for the termination of funds under GGRF and the Solar for All program. While that litigation is pending, however, the EPA is likely to face additional lawsuits over its funding cuts.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.16177_1251.png,N,,2025-10-17 17:08:01.448546

A total of 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable, the Energy Department said.
The loan guarantee will save customers money and improve reliability while supporting economic growth in the five states, said Bill Fehrman, AEP’s chairman, president and chief executive officer.
Wright, in a conference call with reporters, distinguished the AEP loan guarantee from a $4.9 billion federal loan guarantee the department cancelled in July.
The loan guarantee to AEP was among those conditionally approved under Biden, a fact Wright acknowledged to reporters.","WASHINGTON — The Department of Energy said Thursday it has finalized a $1.6 billion loan guarantee to a subsidiary of one of the nation’s largest power companies to upgrade nearly 5,000 miles of transmission lines across five states, mostly in the Midwest, for largely fossil fuel-run energy.

AEP Transmission will upgrade power lines in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia to enhance grid reliability and capacity, the Energy Department said. The project, first offered under the Biden administration, is meant to help meet surging electricity demand from data centers and artificial intelligence.

Ohio-based American Electric Power, which owns AEP Transmission, is one of the nation’s largest utilities, serving 5.6 million customers in 11 states. It primarily produces electricity from coal, natural gas and nuclear power, along with renewable resources such as wind and hydroelectric power.

Thursday’s announcement deepens the Trump administration’s commitment to traditional, polluting energy sources even as it works to discourage the U.S. from clean energy use.

Earlier this month, the administration cancelled $7.6 billion in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election. A total of 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable, the Energy Department said.

The cancellations include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub aimed at developing clean-burning hydrogen fuels to power ships and heavy-duty trucks. A hydrogen project costing up to $1 billion in the Pacific Northwest also was cancelled.

The loan guarantee finalized Thursday is the first offered by the Trump administration under the recently renamed Energy Dominance Financing program created by the massive tax-and-spending law approved this summer by congressional Republicans and signed by President Donald Trump. Electric utilities that receive loans through the program must provide assurances to the government that financial benefits from the financing will be passed on to customers, the Energy Department said.

The project and others being considered will help ensure that Americans “will have access to affordable, reliable and secure energy for decades to come,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement.

“The president has been clear: America must reverse course from the energy subtraction agenda of past administrations and strengthen our electrical grid,” Wright said, adding that modernizing the grid and expanding transmission capacity “will help position the United States to win the AI race and grow our manufacturing base.”

The upgrades supported by the federal financing will replace existing transmission lines in existing rights-of-way with new lines capable of carrying more energy, the power company said.

More than 2,000 miles of transmission lines in Ohio serving 1.5 million people will be replaced, along with more than 1,400 miles in Indiana and Michigan serving 600,000 customers, the company said. An additional 1,400 miles in Oklahoma, serving about 1.2 million people and 26 miles in West Virginia, serving 460,000 people, will be replaced.

The projects will create about 1,100 construction jobs, the company said.

The loan guarantee will save customers money and improve reliability while supporting economic growth in the five states, said Bill Fehrman, AEP’s chairman, president and chief executive officer. “The funds we will save through this program enable us to make additional investments to enhance service for our customers,” he added.

Wright, in a conference call with reporters, distinguished the AEP loan guarantee from a $4.9 billion federal loan guarantee the department cancelled in July. That money would have boosted the planned Grain Belt Express, a new high-voltage transmission line set to deliver solar and wind-generated electricity from the Midwest to eastern states.

The Energy Department said at the time it was “not critical for the federal government to have a role” in the first phase of the $11 billion project planned by Chicago-based Invenergy.

From the September / October 2025 Issue

Arizona has continued to advance a robust set of economic development strategies designed to attract businesses and retain jobs across diverse industries. The state emphasizes both streamlined access for entrepreneurs and substantive incentives to assist both established firms and underserved communities.

One of the state’s flagship initiatives in 2025 has been the BuildItAZ Apprenticeship Initiative, administered by the Arizona Office of Economic Opportunity. This program targets workforce shortages in critical sectors such as construction, infrastructure, and advanced manufacturing.

By offering millions in competitive grants to registered apprenticeship programs, Arizona aims to double its apprenticeship participation by 2026. In 2025, the state awarded $3 million in new grants, supporting employer partnerships, training capacity, and wrap-around services like childcare and transportation for apprentices. A third round of grants was also launched to help programs expand facilities, hire instructors, and purchase training equipment.

The state has also expanded career pathways through Talent Ready AZ, a cross-agency initiative designed to align education with industry needs in high-demand fields like clean energy, IT, aerospace, and healthcare. The ReadyTechGo program, part of this initiative, launched accelerated technical training programs at community colleges, enabling Arizona residents to earn industry credentials within weeks rather than over years.

The Arizona Office of Economic Opportunity has proposed a key initiative called the Arizona Microbusiness Loan Program. Launched in 2024 and activated in 2025, this program supports microbusinesses—those with five or fewer employees—by providing loans to up to $50,000 through community lending partners. The program reinvests repayments back into the loan pool, ensuring sustained support for small-scale entrepreneurs across rural and urban communities.

Business One Stop is an online portal revamped in early 2025 to streamline business formation and compliance. The platform enables fast, multi-agency registration and filings, aimed at reducing manual processes. In 2025 so far, it auto-approved nearly 1,500 new businesses and eliminated over 13,000 business days of bureaucratic delay.

Innovative support for underserved entrepreneurs is exemplified by Impact AZ 2025, a minority business accelerator offering training, mentorship, and supplier-diversity readiness. Launched statewide in 2025, the program connects minority-owned businesses to public and private contracting opportunities, builds business capabilities, and fosters job growth.

Arizona: Where The Future Takes Shape

Arizona continues to set the pace for economic growth, leading the nation in high-tech investment and innovation.

As home to global companies across in-demand industries, the state has earned a reputation as a premier destination for technologies shaping the future.

In the fiscal year that ended on June 30, 2025, the Arizona Commerce Authority (ACA) and local economic development agencies worked with companies that committed to creating 24,285 projected new Arizona jobs and investing over $31 billion in Arizona communities.

“Arizona’s economic momentum has never been stronger, fueled by strategic initiatives that are supporting high-paying job growth in communities statewide,” said Sandra Watson, President and CEO of the Arizona Commerce Authority. “With our unmatched business climate, skilled workforce, top-tier education institutions, and strong industry clusters, Arizona continues to attract global leaders across high-tech industries, further supporting our local small businesses and suppliers.”

This success is no accident. It reflects years of smart policy, forward-looking investments, and a business-friendly environment that consistently attracts top talent and industry leaders. Arizona’s innovation ecosystem, bolstered by world-class universities and a highly-skilled workforce, offers the full package for companies seeking to scale and thrive.

Today, Arizona is globally recognized for its leadership in semiconductors, aerospace and defense, biosciences, batteries, AI, and more. As the state continues to attract global leaders in high-growth industries, it’s clear Arizona is the ideal location for business success.

Reliable energy powers sustainable growth. In addition to abundant talent and a pro-business climate, Arizona offers one of the most reliable and resilient energy grids in the nation—critical for advanced and large-scale operations. With minimal weather-related disruptions, Arizona experienced only six extreme weather-related power outages from 2000 to 2023, well below the national average.

And, more than 44% of Arizona’s power generation comes from clean or renewable sources. The state is home to the second-largest nuclear power plant in the U.S., the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, which generates more than 32 million megawatt-hours annually.

An epicenter for emerging technologies. Arizona is at the forefront of artificial intelligence (AI) and emerging technologies, with global leaders like Apple, Intel, TSMC, Avnet, Cognite, Microsoft, and more operating in the state. Innovation hubs such as Tech Parks Arizona, SkySong, Moonshot, and the Phoenix Bioscience Core are accelerating innovation growth across many sectors.

The state is also home to more than 230 AI-related startups—a number that continues to grow. In recognition of this momentum, the Arizona Commerce Authority selected 10 Software as a Service (SaaS)/AI startups as Fall 2025 Arizona Innovation Challenge awardees.

A premier event destination. Arizona will host SEMICON West, North America’s premier microelectronics exhibition and conference for the first time on October 7-9, 2025. Relocating to Phoenix for the first time after 50 years in San Francisco, the event shift showcases Arizona’s semiconductor leadership. This year’s conference is anticipated to attract more than 35,000 attendees, which would be its largest yet.

Looking ahead to 2026, Arizona will host Arizona Tech Week, the state’s first-ever decentralized tech conference from April 6-12, 2026. The first-of-its-kind conference in Arizona will emphasize the state’s prominent role in the global tech ecosystem and showcase its most compelling innovations and tech leaders.

Ford, GM, and Stellantis have banded together to ask his government to scrap Canada’s zero-emission vehicle mandate, pleading poverty and technological impossibility. Apparently, after a mere century of automotive innovation, these giants have forgotten how to build cars unless they’re permitted to keep belching emissions indefinitely. Their preferred business model involves Canada indefinitely subsidizing nostalgia, rather than seizing an obvious electric future.

Now Stellantis has announced it’s abandoning manufacturing of a major EV line in Brampton, impacting 5,000 Canadian workers.

Let’s be clear. The global automotive market is electrifying quickly, not slowly. Norway is already at nearly 100% electric passenger vehicle sales. China is at 50% of new vehicles being electric. Nepal — Nepal! Sherpas and Mount Everest Nepal! — is seeing 70% of new cars being fully electric now. Europe, China, and the rest of the world have decided that electric is not optional, it is inevitable.

Canada’s Big Three subsidiaries seem to be the last ones clinging desperately to internal combustion engines. Their request to Prime Minister Carney is transparently regressive, like Kodak asking governments to ban digital photography or Blockbuster demanding protection from streaming.

Ironically, these automakers’ insistence on business-as-usual threatens precisely the thing they claim to want: a prosperous Canadian automotive sector. Instead of confronting their own stagnation, they have elected to hold Canada hostage. The message is stark: give us special dispensation to fail, or our factories will fall silent and perhaps be withdrawn entirely. At least it’s an honest threat, albeit breathtakingly entitled.

“The American people deserve transparency, accountability, and a government that honors its commitments.” You can read the full letter HERE.","WASHINGTON – Arizona Senators Ruben Gallego and Mark Kelly joined 30 of their colleagues in demanding the Trump administration immediately restore the Solar for All program, which helps working-class families afford rooftop and community-based solar energy – helping to lower their home energy costs.

In a letter to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin, the senators condemned the administration’s decision to cancel $7 billion in Solar for All funding in August. The program would have created tens of thousands of good-paying jobs in communities across the country, lowered residential electricity bills by at least 20 percent for more than 900,000 households, and saved working families more than $8.7 billion in electric costs over the lifetime of the panels.

“Your agency’s decision to terminate Solar for All is not only unlawful — given this funding was congressionally appropriated and fully obligated — but also ill-timed. Energy bills are soaring across the country and millions of families are facing higher living costs. Electricity bills are 6.2 percent higher than this time last year, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. EPA’s reckless decision to terminate Solar for All directly undermines efforts by Congress to reduce energy costs and improve grid resilience. It jeopardizes economic investments and inflicts severe job losses across the country while undermining the trust and financial certainty that communities, businesses, and local governments have placed in the federal government,” the senators wrote.

This joint letter, led by Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT), follows a letter sent by Senators Kelly and Gallego, Governor Katie Hobbs, and Representatives Greg Stanton and Yassamin Ansari when the program cancellation was first announced in August.

“The EPA’s illegal termination of Solar for All has left states, communities, and businesses across the country in limbo, with critical projects stalled and vulnerable households facing higher energy costs. We demand the EPA immediately reinstate the Solar for All program, rectify the damage caused by this termination, and ensure grantees can proceed with the swift implementation of residential solar projects to slash utility bills and create many thousands of good jobs. In the meantime, we require a full accounting of how the EPA will rectify the damage caused by this program’s disruptive termination,” the senators concluded. “The American people deserve transparency, accountability, and a government that honors its commitments.”

Washington, D.C. – A new resource from Climate Power revealed that Trump’s decision to cancel or threaten billions of dollars in investments in both red and blue states across the country will put 338,150 good-paying jobs and over $23.88 billion in total grant awards on the chopping block. These investments would have created more energy at a time when skyrocketing demand is sending utility bills through the roof. Household electric bills are up 10% nationally since Trump took office, and they are rising at twice the rate of inflation. Now, Trump and Republicans are making it worse by laying off workers and spiking costs for American families.

“The Trump administration is vindictively and callously destroying more than 300,000 good-paying American jobs, once again bending the knee to the fossil fuel industry instead of meeting the needs of the American people,” said Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer. “By canceling hundreds of DOE projects, Trump is ripping away billions of dollars that were flowing to both Republican and Democratic states to support domestic manufacturing, expanding our grid and energy supply, and so much more. Much of this funding stemmed from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which passed the Senate with support from 15 of my Republican colleagues that still serve in the Senate. We cannot let this stand. Americans know that canceling a project that is already underway is not how you save money, it is a waste, and it will only serve to drive up costs, kill jobs, and hurt American industry and investor confidence.”

In Leader Schumer’s state of New York, Trump has canceled or threatened 43 grants representing $338 million in investments.

“Are Americans better off than they were before Trump took office? Not if pink slips and utility bills are the measure,” said Climate Power Communications Director Alex Glass. “Every single Republican member of Congress needs to answer for the damage Trump has done to their communities.

By Mathieu Dion

General Motors Co. and a partner have paused the second phase of a cathode factory in Quebec, resulting in the cancellation of a nickel sulfate project by Vale SA.

GM agreed in 2022 to buy nickel supplies from the Brazilian miner as part of a strategy to build up its battery supply chain for electric vehicles. But weaker-than-expected demand and U.S. policy changes that make EVs less attractive have prompted companies to reconsider investment projects.

The automaker said this week it’s incurring US$1.6 billion in charges tied to its pullback from electric vehicles. Realigning EV capacity will lead to non-cash impairment and other charges of US$1.2 billion, the automaker said in a regulatory filing, while the rest of the costs relate to cancelling contracts and settling commercial arrangements linked to EV investments.

“GM’s long-term strategy is to build a profitable EV business in North America and in light of evolving market dynamics, GM and our partners will pause the second phase of the project,” which involved increasing production capacity of cathode active material, a GM spokesperson said in an emailed statement. The decision was reported earlier by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.

The Detroit company’s partner in the Quebec venture is South Korea’s Posco Future M Co. The first phase is on track to begin producing material for EV batteries next year, the spokesperson said.

Vale said in a separate statement that GM’s move means it won’t need nickel sulfate for now. “As a result, Vale Base Metals must terminate its nickel sulfate plant project,” which was expected to cost $325 million.

Becancour, Quebec, has emerged as an electric-vehicle battery hub, but a number of projects have now been delayed, including a more than $1.2 billion cathode plant of the battery-materials maker Ecopro Group. Ford Motor Co. was initially part of that project, but pulled out.

The Trump administration said in August it would end the program as part of an effort to save money for the taxpayers.

Under the program written into the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, the money was distributed to 60 entities including states, nonprofits, tribes and local governments.

The Trump EPA argued that provisions in this year’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act that repealed “unobligated” balances of the program allowed it to take the funds back.

The states, in their suit, noted the provision only applies to “unobligated” funds and says that all of the funds in question had actually been obligated.

“Congress did not, however, rescind any funds that had been obligated by ‘the day before the date of enactment’ of H.R. 1, which is July 3, 2025. All of the funds awarded To Plaintiffs were obligated by August 16, 2024,” they wrote.

“Beyond the fact that this energy infrastructure funding has already been appropriated to our state and is owed to Arizonans, protecting solar projects and lower electricity bills is personal to me,” Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a statement.

“Arizona families are already facing sky-high electricity bills, and I will not let the EPA wriggle out of its commitment to fund solar energy projects that would lower costs for more than 11,000 Arizona households,” Mayes said.

The suits came from Arizona, Washington state, Minnesota, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and D.C.

Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear (D), Pennsylvania Energy Development Authority Chair Jessica Shirley and the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation also joined the suit.

Morgan Stanley arranged more than $27 billion debt and about $2.5 billion equity into a special purpose vehicle to finance the build-out, according to the report.

Meta is not borrowing the capital itself, but the financing entity is, under the SPV structure. Meta will be the developer, operator and tenant of the project, to be completed in 2029. Reuters had previously reported that the social media giant tapped U.S. bond company PIMCO and Blue Owl Capital for $29 billion in financing for the data centers.

The development community touted the $500 million plant as a big win for St. Louis.
Neil Richardson, CEO and chairman of the St. Louis Development Corporation at the time, called the project a testament to the city’s investment into workforce development.
“We are starting to see a renaissance of our advanced manufacturing industries in north St. Louis city that will drive growth across the entire region,” Richardson said in 2024.
The Missouri Coalition for the Environment released a report on the project earlier this year calling it a compounding of environmental racism in north St. Louis.","A north St. Louis $500 million development planned to create more than 150 jobs is now in doubt after Trump administration cuts to energy grants across the country.

The Department of Energy has rescinded a $197 million federal grant planned to help ICL Group Ltd., an Israeli company that also operates a battery plant in Carondelet, build a new plant near the north riverfront in St. Louis.

The company reported on the possibility of discontinuing the project in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing last week and estimated it could garner a $40 million investment write-off if it did. However, no final decision has been made, the report stated.

Company officials could not immediately be reached for comment Friday.

In the report to shareholders, ICL states the Department of Energy’s decision is a result of a comprehensive review of funding eligibility for a number of projects that had received grants in the renewable energy sector and elsewhere. The company originally received the grant through a 2021 infrastructure bill during the Biden administration.

ICL group planned to produce materials for lithium batteries at the plant at 460 E. Carrie Ave. The group touted it as the first large-scale plant of its kind in the country. ICL planned to complete the project next year.

The project’s grant is just one of many facing the ax under the Trump administration and Energy Secretary Chris Wright’s plans. Wright said the slashes to the grants will cut $7.5 billion in spending through the termination of 321 financial awards funding 223 projects across the country.

In a statement, Wright called cutting the projects a “critical task” for the Trump administration.

The development community touted the $500 million plant as a big win for St. Louis. Neil Richardson, CEO and chairman of the St. Louis Development Corporation at the time, called the project a testament to the city’s investment into workforce development.

“We are starting to see a renaissance of our advanced manufacturing industries in north St. Louis city that will drive growth across the entire region,” Richardson said in 2024.

On Friday, SLDC spokesman Deion Broxton said the corporation hadn’t received any official confirmation from ICL or the federal government on the plant’s future.

The project had critics. Some community members and environmental groups pushed back against the development over environmental concerns and complaints of environmental racism.

The Missouri Coalition for the Environment released a report on the project earlier this year calling it a compounding of environmental racism in north St. Louis. The report noted the battery plant’s location on the north riverfront would put it in the middle of neighborhoods experiencing a high asthma hospitalization rate.

They pointed to a 2019 report, Environmental Racism in St. Louis, that showed most of the city’s air pollution sources are in predominantly Black neighborhoods.

The group’s policy coordinator, Maxine Gill, said the coalition is concerned about Trump’s freezing of renewable energy project grants but called ICL’s proposed development an “environmental injustice.”

“ICL misused President Biden’s Justice40 Executive Order to place a polluting facility in an already overburdened neighborhood, rather than ensuring that pollution is diverted from marginalized communities as the executive order intended,” she said Friday. “If they choose to cancel their project, we are glad that ICL will not further pollute a neighborhood with some of the highest hospitalization rates for asthma in the city.”

Previously, the Planned Industrial Expansion Authority, a development board of the SLDC, awarded the project a 90%, 10-year property tax abatement and touted the program as part of the city’s Economic Justice Action Plan to invest in marginalized areas in St. Louis.

“We will continue to assess the situation,” Broxton said.

That EV boom wasn’t just limited to the U.S., though: Global EV sales hit an all-time high of 2.1 million in September. Two-thirds of those sales were in China, the world’s largest EV market.

And yet, there’s still talk of an “EV retreat,” both in the U.S. and abroad. Automakers have expressed concerns about their EV profits, and policymakers in Canada and the European Union are pausing, or adjusting, their EV mandates.

There’s an “inherent duality of the market moment we’re in,” says Corey Cantor, research director of the Zero Emissions Transportation Association. “On the one hand, EV sales are higher than they have ever been, and yet automakers still remain concerned.”

Here’s why, and what’s going on in the electric vehicle landscape.

EV rush before tax credits expired

EVs counted for nearly 11% of total vehicle sales in the U.S. between July and September. That’s a big increase from the same time period last year, when their share was 8.6%, according to Cox Automotive, which recently released data about the country’s third quarter EV sales.

That jump wasn’t a surprise—it was expected, experts say. Americans were rushing to buy EVs before the federal tax credits expired on September 30.

The tax credits, part of President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, offered up to $7,500 back for Americans who bought a new EV, if the cars they purchased met certain conditions. There was also a credit of up to $4,000 available for used EVs.

President Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” eliminated those tax credits, killing what analysts say was a “key catalyst” for EV adoption. EVs are still seen as a “premium” purchase; in August, the average EV cost more than $57,000, according to Cox—$9,000 more than a similar gas car.

Concerns about future growth

Not every automaker benefited from all those third quarter EV sales, either. Cox Automotive notes that Mercedes-Benz EV sales in that time period were “mostly flat” year-over-year, and Toyota and Nissan sold fewer EVs during that boom than they did in the third quarter of 2024.

Despite the backlash Tesla has been dealing with throughout 2025, that carmaker actually saw an 8% sales increase year-over-year, but its share of total EV sales has fallen. Tesla once made up 49% of all EV sales in the third quarter of 2024, but its share this past quarter was 41%.

Volkswagen, General Motors, Honda, and Hyundai had notable increases in their EV sales. Volkswagen and GM’s sales were more than double the levels one year ago.

But those automakers still have concerns. This week, GM said it was taking a $1.6 billion hit from changing its EV rollout in the U.S. It changed its rollout in part because of Trump’s elimination of the tax credits, and his move to loosen emissions regulations.

advertisement

These policies make the future far less certain for automakers. “Federal policies could tighten again in a couple of years or remain the same,” Cantor says. “The federal policy pathway is far less clear moving forward than it was a year ago.”

One thing experts do expect is that U.S. EV sales will slump after this quarter, because that surge to purchase before the tax credits expired “pulled forward” sales that would have been spread out over more time. Cox Automotive forecasts that EV sales will “drop notably” in Q4 and through the early months of 2026.

EV struggles worldwide

Changing U.S. policies aren’t only affecting the EV sales outlook here. Trump’s tariffs are also adding costs for automakers in international markets, like Canada and across the European Union.

The EU recently said it would review its 2035 target for cutting car emissions to zero. A policy note published before those talks highlighted challenges for the European car industry, “ including higher tariffs on shipments to the U.S.,” the Wall Street Journal reported, as well as low profit margins for EVs and the growth of cheaper Chinese offerings.

China has been dominating the EV market, not just in its own country but worldwide, in part because it offers extremely affordable EVs—some priced as low as $10,000.

But that could make the market oversaturated. While Chinese EV sales are increasing, that growth is happening more and more “at the expense of profitability,” the Wall Street Journal notes; more than 110 EV brands operated there in 2023, and they likely won’t all last.

Hope for the future

Even before Trump’s policies, there was talk of an EV sales slump in 2024. That’s because while sales were increasing, the rate at which they were growing slowed—a common issue for all new technologies as they vie for mainstream appeal. Early adopters drive that beginning growth, and then the industry has to figure out how to attract everyone else.

Now, changing federal policies are making that next step even more difficult. But EV experts still have hope.

“We’d expect the impact of these policy changes to be most acute during the forthcoming year,” Cantor says. “Overall, the global move towards electric vehicles continues.” The International Energy Agency said in May that it expects one in four cars sold worldwide this year to be electric.

Cox Automotive says EV sales are the future, too. “Cx Automotive continues to believe that over the long term—the next 10 years or more—sales of vehicles powered solely by internal combustion engines will continue to decline,” the company wrote in its Q3 EV sales report. “Electrified vehicles—hybrids, plug-in hybrids and pure EVs—are the future.”

We might not get to that future as fast as EV advocates hoped, though. Biden set a goal for EVs to make up 50% of all vehicle sales by 2030. Cox now says EV sales can hit 25% by then. So growth will be slower, “but certainly moving out of the ‘niche’ category,” Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox, wrote in September.

And though the future of U.S. federal policy is up in the air, experts still say innovations will advance to help the EV market. “Continued innovation in battery technology, improved transparency in battery health and expanding infrastructure give reason for optimism,” Valdez Streaty wrote. “The road ahead will be challenging, but progress will continue.”","https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/10/p-1-91423972-ev-sales-figures.jpg",N,,2025-10-17 15:03:00.482957

Residents of other states can visit the Database of State Incentives for Renewables & Efficiency to search for incentives in your area.
Whether it’s installing solar panels or upgrading your home’s energy efficiency, now is the time to invest in clean energy and save money on rising electric bills by taking advantage of these clean energy tax credits.","As we approach the end of 2025, time is running out to take advantage of valuable energy efficiency and clean energy tax credits expanded under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 that were repealed by President Donald Trump and Congress this year. These incentives make clean energy investments and energy-saving upgrades more affordable for homeowners, renters and businesses to help better manage energy costs. But with many of them set to phase out or change significantly after 2025, now is the time to act.

Here’s how you can make the most of energy tax opportunities before they’re gone:

1. Install Solar Panels on Your Home

The Residential Clean Energy Credit offers a 30% federal tax credit for the cost of installing solar panels, solar water heaters and other eligible systems. This credit can significantly lower the upfront cost of switching to solar power.

2. Upgrade to Energy-Efficient HVAC and AppliancesThe Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit allows you to claim up to $3,200 annually for energy-saving upgrades. This includes:

Up to $2,000 for high-efficiency heat pumps and water heaters

Up to $1,200 for energy-efficient home improvements including insulation

Up to $600 for energy-efficient windows

Up to $150 for a home energy audit

✅ Act Now: Systems and improvements completed by Dec. 31, 2025, are eligible for the credits. After 2025, the credits are scheduled to expire unless Congress extends them.

3. Take Advantage of State and Local Incentives

Federal tax credits often stack with state or utility rebates, which can lower your costs even further. Many states offer rebates for:

Solar panel installations

Heat pumps

Weatherization

EV charging stations

Virginia just launched Virginia Energy Connect, a new online platform that consolidates federal, state and local energy incentive programs into a single hub where users can quickly identify relevant opportunities and understand application requirements.

North Carolina residents can utilize the Energy Saver NC website that helps income-eligible homeowners and renters across the state cover the cost of energy efficiency and electrification upgrades. The program is currently only available for Western North Carolina counties, but will soon be expanded to the rest of the state.

Customers of the Local Power Companies in the Tennessee Valley Authority region can use the Energy Right hub to manage energy costs by taking advantage of the incentives, rebates and tools it offers.

Residents of other states can visit the Database of State Incentives for Renewables & Efficiency to search for incentives in your area.

4. Small Businesses and Landlords: Don’t Miss Out

If you own rental property, farm or a small business, you may qualify for commercial clean energy tax credits, which have a different timeline for expiration due to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act rolling back a number of clean energy tax incentives.

Commercial tax credits under Section 48E: for wind and solar facilities that begin construction before July 4, 2026 or are placed in service by December 31, 2027. If construction begins before July 4, 2026, the project has 4 years to complete construction.

The Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit under Section 45Y: for wind and solar projects, construction must begin by July 4, 2026, or be placed in service by December 31, 2027. If construction begins before July 4, 2026, the project has 4 years to complete construction.

Energy-efficient commercial building deductions under Section 179D: this credit was modified by the budget reconciliation bill passed in July 2025, creating a termination date for projects that begin construction after June 30, 2026

Dive Brief:

A coalition of 16 Republican state attorneys general sent letters to Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft last month, probing the companies’ usage of renewable energy certificates to offset their own energy usage and account for emissions reductions.

The state officials, led by Montana AG Austin Knudsen, said in the Sept. 24 letter they were writing to “raise serious concerns” about the tech companies’ respective claims that they match 100% of their energy usage with renewable energy by utilizing renewable energy certificates that are not tied to a specific project.

The AGs said purchasing these type of certificates, known as unbundled RECs, “does not mean that the companies are using renewable energy, or that they are reducing emissions,” the letter said. The AGs said such claims “appear deceptive” based on rising energy demands from the sector and the current U.S. grid makeup.

Dive Insight:

Renewable energy certificates give companies the rights to “environmental, social and other non-power attributes” of renewables and are obtained when one megawatt-hour of renewable-generated electricity is delivered to the grid, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Unbundled RECs, while not tied to a project, provide renewable energy projects additional sources of income to keep projects operating and incentivize new generation, according to trade group American Council on Renewable Energy.

In their letter, the attorneys general probed each company’s usage of unbundled RECs, including questions about how they analyzed if additional generation would come online; their energy usage for each of the five years, without considering RECs; how such certificates are used to calculate the company’s energy usage and scope 2 emissions. The AGs also asked the companies how they use RECs to substantiate public energy usage and emissions reductions claims.

“Major tech companies use unbundled RECs to claim that they have achieved 100% renewable energy ‘use’ or ‘consumption,’ and have reduced their emissions,” the letter said. “Both types of claims appear to be deceptive or misleading.”

In addition to Knudsen, attorneys general from Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Florida, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, West Virginia and Wyoming signed on.

The use of unbundled renewable energy certificates is credited as a part of each of the companies’ respective strategies for matching energy usage with renewable energy. Unbundled RECs represent “a growing proportion of total renewable project revenue” and are “the primary way for many entities to claim the environmental attributes represented by renewable electricity,” according to ACORE.

Amazon said in an email to ESG Dive Friday that it has received and is reviewing the letter from the state AGs. Additionally, it said it expects the number of unbundled RECs it purchases will decrease over time as additional projects come online.

Amazon announced last year that it matched 100% of its operational electricity usage with renewable energy in 2023, seven years ahead of its 2030 target. The e-commerce and tech company said at the time that it invested in more than 500 renewable energy projects, but also said it purchases both bundled — which are purchased in connection to a project — and unbundled RECs. Amazon said the usage of RECs allows it, and any other renewable energy purchaser, to account for energy it has bought, the company said in a 2024 blog post explaining how it reached its goal.

“No company with complex and growing operations is able today to only consume renewable energy — there simply aren’t enough sources in enough locations, and it takes a while for new projects to come online,” the blog said. “Like most companies with ambitious climate goals like ours, we also purchase RECs.”

Google said it first matched 100% of its operational electricity with renewable energy in 2017 by annually purchasing the same amount of renewable energy, through physical energy purchases and RECs, as it uses in megawatt-hours. The company also has a goal to run on 24/7 carbon-free energy on every grid it operates in by 2030 and reported reaching 70% hourly matching in the U.S. in 2024 in its latest sustainability report.

Meta also said in its most recent sustainability report it has maintained net-zero across its scope 1 and scope 2 emissions since 2020. The social media and tech conglomerate said it achieved that goal by becoming one of largest corporate procurers of renewable energy and making renewable procurement a key part of that strategy.

Microsoft has a goal to hit net-zero across its operations by 2025, which it plans to achieve through energy efficiency, decarbonization and reaching “100% direct renewable electricity by 2025,” according to a sustainability fact sheet. Microsoft said in the fact sheet it “procures enough renewable electricity to match 100% of our global electricity consumption” and, when it is unable to do so in markets it operates in, will look to purchase an equivalent volume of renewable electricity from nearby markets.

By Jack Wittels

The world’s shipping regulator postponed a decision on adopting a landmark charge on vessel emissions, a shock move that highlights the Trump administration’s efforts to disrupt international climate diplomacy.

The postponement marks a setback for multilateral environmental regulations ahead of next month’s COP30 climate summit in Brazil.

Countries gathered at the International Maritime Organization’s London headquarters this week to decide on whether to make ships start paying for the more than 1 billion tons of greenhouse gases they emit each year. On Friday, they voted to push back that ballot for a year, following a proposal put forward by Saudi Arabia.

Industry insiders had previously expected the rules to pass, despite United States pressure. They’ve been years in the making, and would be the world’s first global, fixed charge on emissions for any industry. They would also pave the way for the end of oil as shipping’s dominant fuel and opened the door for cleaner alternatives like ammonia.

While the plan had clear international support back in April, that wavered this week as the U.S. dialed up pressure, threatening wide-ranging measures against those who backed the planned rules that President Donald Trump on Thursday said he was “outraged” about.

The International Chamber of Shipping, representing over 80 per cent of the world’s fleet, said it was disappointed with the result, and that uncertainty over the plan’s future threatens investments needed to make the sector cleaner.

US Pressure

The decision’s delay demonstrates the effect that pressure from the Trump administration can have. The U.S. strongly opposed the ship emissions charges, calling them a “global carbon tax” on Americans and warning of “disastrous” economic impacts. It had urged other nations to reject the regulations from “an unaccountable UN organization,” saying some estimates had forecast shipping costs to jump as much as 10 per cent or more.

The State Department had said it would consider measures such as port levies, visa restrictions, commercial penalties and sanctions on officials. It also previously mentioned tariffs as part of potential responses, though it became unclear if they remained on the table.

Trump said the U.S. wouldn’t adhere to the carbon tax “in any way, shape, or form,” and that he was “outraged” that the IMO was holding a vote.

The U.S. also put pressure on the plans this week by asking for another step in adopting the charge if countries voted in favour of it — proposing nations explicitly opt in after the vote in a shift from a “tacit acceptance” process. That would effectively add a further hurdle for them coming into force.

There were signs of wavering this week. Bloomberg reported Thursday that Athens, which had long been skeptical about the plan because of the impact on its maritime industry, was considering abstaining.

On Friday, Singapore — previously a supporter of the plan — proposed that nations delay voting on the charge. That was backed by Saudi Arabia, which was already against the rule.

Climate Impact

The plan’s failure is another example of the challenges that international climate diplomacy and regulation face. The Trump administration has been dismantling its domestic climate policy and attempting to disrupt efforts to cut emissions globally. Companies have also ditched climate commitments over the past year as the reality of meeting ambitious time frames becomes clear and the marketing benefits of having green credentials fade.

Though Trump has pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement, the withdrawal only takes formal effect in 2026. In practice, the U.S. will still be able to block efforts to reach consensus at the COP30 talks in November.

The maritime industry accounts for over four-fifths of the world’s trade and more than one per cent of all emissions, and the carbon levy was a key part of the IMO’s push for international shipping to reach net zero by around mid-century.

That goal now looks more difficult to achieve.

“We are disappointed that member states have not been able to agree a way forward at this meeting,” International Chamber of Shipping Secretary General Thomas Kazakos said in a statement. “Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonize the maritime sector, in line with the goals set out in the IMO GHG strategy.”

About Peacock Solar

Lightsource bp developed, constructed and currently operates Peacock Solar, which commenced commercial operations in November 2024. The 187 MW project directly powers a nearby manufacturing complex owned by Gulf Coast Growth Ventures, a joint venture between ExxonMobil and the Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC).

During construction, the project created over 300 on-site jobs. Peacock Solar is expected to generate more than $25 million in tax revenue for the local community over 25 years.

The project actively fosters agricultural and biodiversity initiatives, incorporating sheep grazing to enhance land health and ecosystem services. In recognition of this innovative approach, Peacock Solar was awarded the 2025 North American Agrivoltaics Award for Solar Ranch of the Year.

In this blog, we will address several common concerns about Proposition 4.
Moreover, this half of the funding would be split between the New Water Supply for Texas Fund and the State Water Implementation Fund for Texas (SWIFT).
To learn more about how to get engaged in regional planning, read our previous blogs about the State Water Plan and the State Flood Plan.
Proposition 4 would set up automatic deposits to the Texas Water Fund, which may limit legislative oversight, transparency, and adaptability to emergencies.","Proposition 4, which is set to appear on the ballot this fall, proposes a constitutional amendment that would allocate $1 billion annually to the Texas Water Fund starting in 2027 and through 2047. This proposition has sparked both hope and concern for Texas’ water future. In this blog, we will address several common concerns about Proposition 4.

At least half of the annual funding will be directed to controversial new water supply projects.

Proposition 4 allows funding for a wide range of new water supply projects, some of which raise serious concerns for public health and the environment - like oil and gas wastewater reuse and seawater desalination projects. However, this proposition also makes funding available for sustainable new water supply projects, such as aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) and water and wastewater reuse. Moreover, this half of the funding would be split between the New Water Supply for Texas Fund and the State Water Implementation Fund for Texas (SWIFT). The SWIFT funds regionally approved projects listed in the State Water Plan, which include many sustainable solutions like water conservation, water infrastructure improvements, nature-based solutions, and others. With at least part of this portion of the funding tied to projects approved by Texas communities, the potential for positive impact is real - but only if Texans come together to advocate for the money to be directed away from controversial projects.

Proposition 4 would make it easier to advance controversial projects like the Marvin Nichols Reservoir, water transfer from East Texas, and expansion of seawater desalination.

Proposition 4 does not favor any specific type of project, nor does it establish criteria for how projects will be prioritized. This makes public participation critically important. Much of the decision-making will happen through regional planning groups and TWDB established processes, which are open to the public. We encourage people to attend TWDB’s public meetings and get involved in regional water planning, where Texans help determine which projects move forward and best serve the needs of their communities. To learn more about how to get engaged in regional planning, read our previous blogs about the State Water Plan and the State Flood Plan. The more Texans speak up, the harder it is to ignore community needs and push political or industry agendas.

Funding allocation decisions will rest with the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB), which includes governor-appointed members.

We understand the concern that funding allocation decisions could be politically driven. That’s why public participation and advocacy are critically important - especially if Proposition 4 passes. It’s important to remember that many projects must go through established processes like public meetings, hearings, and comment periods, offering opportunities for community input. If Texans show up and speak up, the outcomes can change. The recent stalling of the Inner Harbor seawater desalination plant in Corpus Christi is an excellent example how public involvement can drive the desired change, even in the face of pressure from special interests and the support from the governor. For our part, we will continue to monitor how funds are allocated, attend public meetings, and engage with agencies like TWDB and TCEQ to ensure transparency and accountability.

Proposition 4 would set up automatic deposits to the Texas Water Fund, which may limit legislative oversight, transparency, and adaptability to emergencies.

Proposition 4 brings a long-term funding stream, but it doesn’t lock the Texas Legislature out. The automatic transfer simply creates predictable funding. The Legislature must still pass a budget bill every two years to authorize the appropriations. An additional provision outlined in the House Joint Resolution 7 (HJR 7) - from which Proposition 4 has resulted - allows the Legislature to temporarily suspend deposits during a declared state of disaster, thus giving the state flexibility to respond to emergencies. To ensure transparency in the spending process, the enabling legislation - Senate Bill 7 (SB 7) - established the Texas Water Fund Advisory Committee, composed of legislators and agency representatives, to oversee spending and make recommendations that keep investments transparent and aligned with the state’s water needs. In addition, the Legislature is free to make additional appropriations beyond the $1 billion to address specific needs or even projects if money is available from state or federal revenues.

Proposition 4 may take money away from other priorities.

Proposition 4 doesn’t raise taxes or take money away from existing priorities, like transportation or education. It uses surplus state sales tax revenue, money that’s only allocated once collections exceed $46.5 billion in a given year. In other words, this is extra money that the state already has, and Proposition 4 would direct $1 billion each year to water needs.

But the workers responsible for carrying out the president’s plans for more fossil fuels and less wind and solar power are still hard at work. Some are approving permits for companies that want to extract metals, coal, oil and gas from public lands and federal waters. Others are rolling back limits on the greenhouse gas emissions that are driving climate change.

On Thursday the Bureau of Land Management approved the expansion of a copper mine on public land in Utah. Earlier this week the Interior Department prepared to open more than 250,000 acres of land in Wyoming and Nebraska to oil drilling, and held a coal lease sale for access to Montana’s Powder River Basin. And at the Environmental Protection Agency, employees are finalizing a plan to allow more mercury emissions from coal plants, according to two people familiar with the work underway.

Charlotte Taylor, a spokeswoman for the Interior Department, said the agency was doing what was necessary in light of President Trump’s declaration in January of a national energy emergency.

“Work related to permitting, leasing and other essential energy operations is continuing as excepted work to help strengthen the nation’s energy security, maintain reliable supplies and protect American consumers from disruption,” Ms. Taylor said.

Most experts say that there is no national energy emergency, pointing to record amounts of oil and gas that is being produced in the United States. Electricity demand, however, is on the rise, driven largely by the explosion of data centers as well as population growth and the rise of artificial intelligence applications. At the same time, the Trump administration has been trying to slow or stop the expansion of renewable energy that could add to the nation’s electricity supply.

“If this is truly about keeping the lights on, then why suppress the cleanest and cheapest energy that’s coming online?” said Alexandra Adams, chief policy advocacy officer for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group.

The continuation of work on fossil fuel projects during the shutdown is both legal and appropriate, said Rachel Cauley, a spokeswoman for the Office of Management and Budget.

“Approving energy development is no different than keeping open national parks — it can be done to the extent funds are available and at some point money will run out,” Ms. Cauley said. She blamed Democrats for the shutdown, which she said has forced Mr. Trump “to pick and choose which programs to fund with the dwindling dollars that remain carried over from last year.”

Mr. Trump “is showing us exactly who and what matters to him, which is industry executives and his political allies,” said Stephanie Kurose, deputy director of government affairs at the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental group.

At the Energy Department, nearly 200 employees were told last week that their jobs were being eliminated. At the same time, department employees approved a plan to improve electric transmission lines across Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia.

Most Environmental Protection Agency employees have been working through the shutdown. Union officials believe the agency has been able to do that by tapping into appropriated funds that have carried over from the previous funding period, but E.P.A. officials have declined to answer questions about what money they are using or how long it will last.

Employees working on weakening or repealing regulations that the Trump administration has called burdensome to oil, gas and coal companies have been told to press on, according to two E.P.A. officials who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to discuss agency work. One regulation nearing completion would loosen power plant limits on emissions of mercury, a neurotoxin that impairs brain development, the two officials said.

Brigit Hirsch, a spokeswoman for the E.P.A., said in a statement that the agency is continuing to fulfill legal obligations, meet emergency response and work on administration priorities.

“We are unwavering in our commitment to our mission of providing clean air, clean land, and clean water for all Americans,” she said. “Moreover, we’ll continue to dismantle the Biden Administration’s wasteful and costly agenda.”

And the Interior Department has furloughed about half of its 58,600 employees but exempted those who permit fossil fuel and mining projects on public lands and in federal waters. On Thursday it announced it had approved an expansion of the copper mining operations at the Lisbon Valley Copper Mine in San Juan County, Utah.

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which oversees offshore energy development, “will cease all renewable energy activities” during the shutdown, according to a copy of the bureau’s plan. But its plan calls for using carry-over funds to keep employees working on “priority conventional energy projects,” including offshore drilling permits and a five-year plan for selling drilling leases along the outer continental shelf.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/17/multimedia/17cli-shutdown-htcl/17cli-shutdown-htcl-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 14:10:32.686701

The Delivering on the UAE Consensus progress report, unveiled at a pre-COP30 high-level event in Brasília, finds that while 2024 saw an unprecedented 582 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy added globally, the pace remains far short of what is needed to meet the COP28 UAE Consensus goal of tripling renewables capacity to 11.2 terawatts (TW) by 2030.

To stay on track, the world must now add a staggering 1,122 GW of new renewable capacity each year from 2025 onwards — requiring annual growth to accelerate to 16.6% throughout the remainder of the decade.

Energy efficiency progress is equally off pace. The report shows that global energy intensity improved by just 1% in 2024, well below the 4% annual improvement required to meet the UAE Consensus goal of doubling efficiency by 2030 and keeping the 1.5°C target within reach.

Urgent Call for Action

The report urges governments to integrate renewable targets into their national climate plans (NDC 3.0) ahead of COP30 in Belém, double their collective ambition to align with global goals, and significantly increase renewable investment. Between 2025 and 2030, at least USD 1.4 trillion in annual investment will be needed — more than twice the USD 624 billion recorded in 2024,

G20 nations, which are expected to account for over 80% of global renewables by 2030, are called upon to take the lead. The report highlights that G7 countries, in particular, must boost their share to around 20% of global capacity by the end of the decade while delivering on international climate finance commitments.

That includes meeting the new collective quantified goal (NCQG) of USD 300 billion per year and scaling up towards the aspirational USD 1.3 trillion figure confirmed at COP29 in Azerbaijan.

Beyond Renewables: Grids, Supply Chains, and Clean Tech

The report also stresses the urgent need to expand and modernise electricity grids, strengthen renewable supply chains, and scale clean-tech manufacturing in areas such as solar, wind, batteries, and hydrogen.

While renewable investment grew 7% in 2024, actual disbursements remain well below what is needed to sustain project pipelines and accelerate deployment. IRENA and its partners warn that fair and transparent trade practices must be secured for key materials and technologies to ensure stable supply chains.

Haustveit oversees Fossil Energy and National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) programs and manages a $5 billion research development portfolio that includes coal, oil, natural gas and critical minerals with the objective of advancing affordable and reliable energy solutions, according to the Department of Energy.
“Without more energy and without more reliable energy, America will face an energy disaster with affordability and reliability issues unlike anything we’ve experienced since the advent of electricity,” he said.
“As we improve our grid, we are committed to loading it with record supplies of reliable energy, including coal, nuclear and natural gas.
Make no mistake, the prior administration’s war on coal and neglect of nuclear energy are over,” he said.","The U.S. will need more reliable energy sources than ever before and the Trump administration will deliver, an assistant secretary at the U.S. Department of Energy said at a summit Thursday.

The Louisiana Energy Security Summit 2025 in New Orleans featured U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy along with keynote speaker Kyle Haustveit and brought 70 thought leaders from around the country to discuss the state’s role in advancing U.S. energy dominance in the face of evolving global challenges.

“The president and our administration are determined to unleash greater energy production than ever before, utilizing every reliable energy source at our disposal,” said Haustveit, assistant secretary for Fossil Energy Department Management in the U.S. Department of Energy.

“And as we do this, we will unleash unparalleled prosperity across our nation, including this region,” said Haustveit, who addressed the summit by video because of the federal government shutdown.

Haustveit oversees Fossil Energy and National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) programs and manages a $5 billion research development portfolio that includes coal, oil, natural gas and critical minerals with the objective of advancing affordable and reliable energy solutions, according to the Department of Energy.

Haustveit said the previous administration pursued an anti-energy policy. “It restrained both energy production and the building of energy infrastructure such as natural gas pipelines.”

America needs both more energy and more energy diversity, said Haustveit, a North Dakota native whose family has worked in the energy industry for three generations.

“Thanks to the accelerating march of innovation and progress, including the president’s manufacturing revival and the coming rise in AI data center growth, a tidal wave of energy demand is headed our way and is about to wash over this nation and indeed the world,” Haustveit said.

Haustveit said the Energy Department’s Florence Berkeley National Lab estimated last year that data center demand for energy will double or triple by 2028. “The kind of energy we will need for these data centers will be rock solid energy that delivers 24-7 reliability. In other words, if we want to power these data centers and reindustrialize our country, we not only need more energy supply, we also need more energy diversity.,” said Haustveit.

“The United States needs to develop the most reliable energy sources on the planet, including coal and nuclear, oil and natural gas,” said Haustveit. “Without more energy and without more reliable energy, America will face an energy disaster with affordability and reliability issues unlike anything we’ve experienced since the advent of electricity,” he said.

Haustveit said Secretary of Energy Chris Wright has responded to the crisis by issuing eight emergency orders pursuant to Section 202c of the Federal Powers Act that have strengthened grid reliability during peak demand to prevent power outages and saved consumers at least $4.7 million in energy costs.

“We’re looking for stakeholder input on how best to utilize our funding programs and authorities to rapidly expand energy generation and transmission grid capacity,” the assistant secretary said. “As we improve our grid, we are committed to loading it with record supplies of reliable energy, including coal, nuclear and natural gas. Given the AI revolution alone and the coming surge in consumption, there is clearly no alternative to the pro energy course we are taking,” said Haustveit.

Haustveit said Energy Department leadership team has identified 16 potential sites at national labs and other DOE-owned land for AI data center development.

“We support removing regulations that constrain AI development, and we are unleashing DOE resources and the innovation of our national labs to ensure we have the resources to power the AI revolution. But again, none of this can be sustained without an unprecedented surge in energy supply,” said Haustveit.

Haustveit said the department is laser focused on fulfilling the president’s mandates on nuclear energy. He said the focus is on enabling the rapid deployment and export of next generation nuclear technology, bringing down operating costs for existing reactors, expanding the application of nuclear energy beyond electricity to support manufacturing and industry, strengthening nuclear fuel infrastructure, restarting reactors that were prematurely closed, and cutting regulations that have stifled the industry.

“Streamlining the permitting process will ensure nuclear developers get steel in the ground faster,” Hustveit said. “As vice chair of the new National Energy Dominance Council, Secretary Wright is working closely with the chair, Interior Secretary [Doug] Burgum, and other council members to unleash American energy through permitting reform. Make no mistake, the prior administration’s war on coal and neglect of nuclear energy are over,” he said.

Haustveit said the administration will also “unleash” another base load resource, natural gas.

“We are on the cusp of an LNG revolution that will fill the world with our LNG bounty. Several of the LNG export authorizations processed during the first Trump administration have now become actual exports, including the Plaquemines LNG project right here in Louisiana that has just come online,” said Haustveit.

Hospitality workers won a number of major victories including a $20/hour minimum wage—with increases that will bring workers to $22/hour by the end of the contract—job security protections, improved housekeeping workloads and improved safety standards. “This victory is an attestation of our members’ strength, their will, and determination. They held the line for over a month in the heat and rain, as they fought to secure better standards after being left behind for so long. It was an incredibly hard fight, and the outcome reflects just that. Now we expect all the players in Houston’s hospitality industry to follow suit and pay workers a living wage,” said Franchesca Caraballo, Texas Chapter President of Local 23.

Michigan Home Care Workers Win Election to Join SEIU: On Thursday, 32,000 home care workers voted to form a union with SEIU Healthcare Michigan, 13 years after former Gov. Rick Snyder ripped away their collective bargaining rights by reclassifying them. The current governor of Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer, reversed her predecessor’s attack on these workers last year, paving the way for them to fight for the wages and benefits they deserve. “This is a proud day for Michigan. If anyone needs a union, it’s home care workers. When the union was stolen from us, I was devastated. But I didn’t lose hope. I knew we would reclaim our union one day—and that day has finally come.” said Phyllis Pride, a home care worker from Ecorse. “This all happened because we took a stand: home care workers and the people we care for deserve better.

Sutter Health Workers Secure New Tentative Agreement: More than 4,700 SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West (SEIU-UHW) members at eight Sutter Health facilities across Northern California have successfully leveraged a major strike threat to reach a tentative agreement on their new contract. Nursing assistants, respiratory therapists, environmental services, food services, x-ray technicians, respiratory therapists and other essential staff voted overwhelmingly earlier this month to authorize a work stoppage in response to bad faith bargaining from Sutter executives. The power of their unity paid off, and members will now vote on a deal that includes wins like a 14% across-the-board raise, protections for health care and retirement benefits, and more. “This tentative agreement shows that when we stand united, we can win improvements that protect both healthcare workers and our patients,” said Dinora Garcia, a dietary clerk from Sutter Lakeside Hospital in Lakeport. “Reaching this agreement wasn’t easy but we stood together to advocate for worker and patient safety, improved staffing levels, and fair wages and benefits that reflect the vital work we do every day.”

At 3.99%, the newest versions of the Model S and Model X now have the same interest rates as the 2026 Tesla Model Y.
However, our analysis found that 2026 Tesla Model S and Model X lease prices remain completely unchanged.
Tesla raised MSRPs on both the Model S and Model X back in August by roughly $10,000.","Tesla lowered interest rates today on the Model S and Model X to as low as 3.99% APR. It's the most significant change since federal tax credits ended on September 30. While this isn't the best Tesla financing deal that we've ever seen, our analysis found that it could translate to a nearly $4,000 price cut for some EV buyers.

But The Financing Deal Has A Catch

Starting today, all 2026 Tesla Model S and Model X configurations are eligible for 3.99% APR for 72 months. Like past financing deals from Tesla, the catch is that you'll need to make a down payment to get the advertised interest rate. Currently, that's 3% of the purchase price. So on a $100,000 vehicle, that would be $3,000.

With a zero-down loan, the interest rate changes to 4.99%. Both rates are lower than the previous one of 5.14% APR, though the 3.99% deal clearly offers the biggest savings. On a $100,000 vehicle, today's change could translate to a roughly $3,700 price cut, assuming a buyer puts down the 3% minimum down payment.

We've Seen Better Incentives From Tesla

Having said that, we've seen better deals from Tesla. The most competitive offers have involved 0% financing, free FSD, and free Supercharging. However, today's change is far more moderate in our view. At 3.99%, the newest versions of the Model S and Model X now have the same interest rates as the 2026 Tesla Model Y.

For some buyers, we think today's interest rate drops could make it a good time to buy. However, our analysis found that 2026 Tesla Model S and Model X lease prices remain completely unchanged. The cheapest Model S lease has an effective cost of just over $2,000 a month, while the Model X lease comes in at over $2,300.

Both EVs are significantly more expensive after tax credits changed on October 1. While neither one qualified for the credit on purchases, they did take advantage of a $7,500 Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit that made leases more affordable. This month's elimination of the credit caused lease prices to surge up to $242 per month.

Tesla raised MSRPs on both the Model S and Model X back in August by roughly $10,000. The price hikes were largely the result of the inclusion of the standard Luxe Package with benefits like Full Self-Driving and Supercharging. At the time, our analysis found that Tesla's lease prices also increased by approximately 20%.

Her letter also noted that the “delay in issuing the PFNA report coincided with EPA’s decision, in May of this year, to rescind” drinking water limits for PFNA and several other forever chemicals, also known as PFAS.
“This seems to be more than coincidence given that there has been strong industry pushback on regulating PFAS,” Pingree wrote.
“Reading that piece made my blood boil.” Background: PFNA is in drinking water systems serving some 26 million people.
Although it was subject to a voluntary phaseout almost two decades ago, the chemical is now widespread in the environment.","What Happened: The ranking member of a key House subcommittee demanded answers this week from the Environmental Protection Agency about why it has yet to make public a report documenting the health risks posed by a forever chemical found in the water of millions of Americans.

In a letter sent to the EPA on Thursday, Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-Maine, cited a ProPublica story from last week that quoted government scientists saying the report had been ready for publishing in April but had yet to be released. Pingree — the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee’s Subcommittee on the Interior, Environment and Related Agencies — asked EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin for “clear answers” about why the report had not been made public, who directed its delay and when Zeldin would commit to releasing it.

What They Said: Pingree referred to the delay in publishing the report as part of “a growing pattern of interference with the Agency’s scientific work” and pointed to the Integrated Risk Information System, the EPA program that wrote it. IRIS, which was created during Ronald Reagan’s presidency, analyzes the health harm chemicals can cause. “The Trump Administration, Republicans in Congress, and industry have been hostile to the IRIS program,” she wrote, asking whether scientists had been removed or reassigned from the program and, if so, why.

Her letter also noted that the “delay in issuing the PFNA report coincided with EPA’s decision, in May of this year, to rescind” drinking water limits for PFNA and several other forever chemicals, also known as PFAS. “This seems to be more than coincidence given that there has been strong industry pushback on regulating PFAS,” Pingree wrote.

Pingree noted that the delay appears to contradict Zeldin’s repeated public statements about protecting the public from PFAS compounds, which contaminate soil and water in Maine and throughout the country. “Our state is really hoping for help from the federal government. And when you see the federal government turn their back on you and decide to withhold the data … that’s really discouraging,” she told ProPublica. “Reading that piece made my blood boil.”

Background: PFNA is in drinking water systems serving some 26 million people. The report in question found that the chemical interferes with human development by causing lower birth weights and, based on animal evidence, likely causes damage to the liver and to male reproductive systems, including reductions in testosterone levels, sperm production and the size of reproductive organs.

PFNA was a component of firefighting foam and a processing aid to make a kind of plastic used in circuit boards, valves and pipes. Although it was subject to a voluntary phaseout almost two decades ago, the chemical is now widespread in the environment.

ProPublica’s reporting found that IRIS has been drastically reduced under the Trump administration. The program, which calculates values that can be used to set limits for pollutants in drinking water and cleanup levels for toxic sites, has been a frequent target of industry. Project 2025, the conservative blueprint that has set the direction for President Donald Trump’s second administration, called for IRIS to be eliminated. Earlier this year, Republicans in Congress introduced legislation called the “No IRIS Act.” Of 55 EPA scientists Publica identified as having worked on recent IRIS assessments, only eight remain in the office, according to a source familiar with the program.

Why It Matters: The report calculated the amount of PFNA that people can be exposed to without being harmed — a critical measurement that can be used to set limits for cleaning up PFNA in contaminated areas called Superfund sites and for removing the chemical from drinking water. This calculation will prove critical to communities around the country as they battle polluters over who will pay to remove PFNA and other forever chemicals from the environment.",https://img.assets-d.propublica.org/v5/images/AP22313127406391_maxHeight_3000_maxWidth_3000.jpg?crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&imgixProfile=propublicaAssetsV5&q=90&w=1200&s=f9f15155da7a44eeb89cd7f2e01f3d09,N,,2025-10-17 14:11:02.736112

Minneapolis-based Xcel Energy, which generates and distributes electricity and gas to customers across eight states, seeks proposals for power generation projects to increase the capacity of its Texas-New Mexico electric system.

The company said Oct. 10 it’s working to meet the forecasted increase in demand, as well as the needs of the growing regional economy.

“For more than a century, we’ve had the privilege of powering the growth of this region and supporting the communities and industries that call it home,” said Adrian J. Rodriguez, president of Xcel Energy Texas–New Mexico. “As economic activity continues to expand, we’re planning ahead to ensure we can meet our customers’ growing energy needs with reliable, cost-effective service and a balanced approach to our energy future.”

Xcel on Oct. 10 filed a request for proposals (RFP), opening the competitive bidding process for all sources of new power projects to add more than 2,000 megawatts to the system when those sources are operating at their intended design capacity.

The Texas-New Mexico RFP seeks resources to meet identified power needs from 2030 through 2032, the company said.

“Industries can’t grow without power, so we are taking an all-of-the-above approach to new generation projects,” Rodriguez said. “This process is the first step toward powering new jobs and supporting continued economic growth in our region.”

Xcel Energy operates a diverse mix of power generation facilities in its Texas–New Mexico service area, including conventional power generating stations and large-scale wind installations. The region’s energy mix also includes electricity supplied through power purchase agreements.

The company said it’s working with an independent monitor appointed by state regulators to ensure the design and execution of the RFP is fair, competitive, and transparent.

In addition to the need to increase generating capacity, the company also seeks proposals for projects that will provide renewable energy credits to meet New Mexico Renewable Portfolio Standard requirements, as well as projects that may lower costs or improve service to its customers.

Bids from developers are due by Jan. 13, 2026. All documents and guidance for submission may be found online.

Xcel Energy will evaluate submissions with proposed commercial operation dates before June 2032 and said it expects to file a bid evaluation report and recommended portfolio to the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission for review in the second quarter of 2026.

The attorneys general of more than a dozen states on Thursday sued the Trump administration over the termination of $7 billion in funding intended for affordable solar energy projects across the U.S.

The coalition, which also included the District of Columbia and other stakeholders, argued in the lawsuit that the Environmental Protection Agency’s cancellation of the Solar for All program violated the law governing federal agencies and the constitutional separation of powers. The program was introduced in 2022 as part of former President Joe Biden’s landmark climate law, intended to make the renewable energy accessible to nearly 1 million Americans.

Increasing the use of solar energy reduces reliance on coal, oil and natural gas. Burning these fossil fuels for electricity is a primary driver of climate change globally because they emit greenhouse gases that trap the Earth’s heat.

The EPA rescinded the Solar for All funds in August after President Donald Trump’s massive tax and spending law passed in Congress a month earlier, with Administrator Lee Zeldin calling the program a “boondoggle.”

The EPA said in an email Thursday that it does not comment on pending litigation.

Thursday’s filing in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington was led by Washington Attorney General Nick Brown, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, and argues the termination of the funding was unlawful. It names the EPA and Zeldin as defendants.

RELATED: Regulators know PG&amp;E, Edison are slow to hook up solar. Why are there no penalties?

Joining the lawsuit are the attorneys general in California, Colorado, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont, all of whom are Democrats, as well as the governor of Kentucky, the chair of the Pennsylvania Energy Development Authority, and the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation.

“Congress passed a solar energy program to help make electricity costs more affordable, but the administration is ignoring the law and focused on the conspiracy theory that climate change is a hoax,” Brown said in a statement.

Advocates have touted the program not only for its benefits to lower-income communities needing access to money for clean-energy projects, but also for local workforces and to keep electricity prices reasonable.

“At a time when energy bills are at a record high and only continuing to skyrocket, the Trump Administration is needlessly hampering an industry that can produce safe, reliable, and inexpensive energy,” California Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a statement.

A similar group of states filed a separate lawsuit Wednesday in the Court of Federal Claims against the Trump administration arguing that the program funding cancellation is a breach of contract and said they are seeking to recover monetary damages.

This week’s litigation ramps up the pressure on the Trump administration over the program. Nonprofit organizations and other groups sued over Solar for All funding for similar reasoning earlier this month, and Harris County in Texas filed a lawsuit last week over its award. More than two dozen Democratic senators also wrote a letter to Zeldin this week calling for the program to be restored.

Solar for All was affiliated with another $20 billion in green funding, formally known as the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, terminated by the Trump administration in March.

The canceled $27 billion is just one example of the efforts the administration has taken against clean energy. Trump has invested in fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal while slashing climate regulation, standing in the way of clean energy developments and reversing environmental policy.

Challenges and achievements of the LAud framework The case study on implementing the LAud framework at State Grid Jiangsu Electric Power Company faced several challenges.","Lifecycle auditing

The concept of LAud emerged as an extension of continuous auditing (CA), building upon foundational work by Groomer and Murthy16 and Vasarhelyi and Halper17. While early definitions of CA focused on financial reporting, LAud broadens this scope to encompass holistic project oversight. Rezaee et al.18 described CA as a systematic process for gathering electronic audit evidence to evaluate financial statements in real-time systems, a foundation that LAud expands by integrating cross-functional operational data. Eulerich and Kalinichenko19 framed CA as an automated monitoring system for detecting deviations from standards, a concept LAud extends to track multidimensional performance metrics across project lifecycles. In power-grid engineering contexts, LAud leverages advanced technology to enhance the timeliness and accuracy of financial and operational reporting, detect errors and fraud, and provide actionable insights for decision-making11,12,20. This evolution addresses the limitations of traditional risk management methods in power-grid projects, which often lack robust evaluation frameworks13.

Auditors now face demands for real-time assurance not only over financial data but also operational integrity, requiring continuous assessment of control systems for anomalies and risks21,22. Traditional auditing methodologies, designed for periodic reviews, struggle to meet these dynamic requirements23. LAud overcomes these constraints by enabling concurrent monitoring of project schedules, budgets, quality benchmarks, and risk indicators throughout the asset lifecycle24. In power-grid projects, this facilitates immediate corrective actions and proactive risk mitigation through data integration from project management software, financial systems, and operational logs. The principles of LAud build upon those articulated for CA25,26, enhanced for lifecycle applications27. These include:

High-frequency audit cycles aligned with project milestones.

Automated monitoring of technical, financial, and operational parameters.

Exception-based auditing supplemented by human expertise for complex judgments.

Integration of predictive analytics for risk identification in engineering workflows.

Real-time assurance over both financial and non-financial performance indicators.

Continuous data modeling using inputs from IoT sensors, ERP systems, and maintenance records.

As a technology-dependent methodology, LAud requires sophisticated tools for implementation. Auditors employ computer-assisted audit techniques to analyze heterogeneous data streams, assess risks, and validate compliance across project phases28. Successful deployment depends on secure integration with client systems for installing monitoring modules, collecting evidence, and generating alerts29. In power-grid contexts, this necessitates interoperability with specialized engineering platforms and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. Critical success factors include executive sponsorship, mature IT infrastructure, adaptive internal audit structures, and workforce upskilling in both audit principles and engineering operations26,30.

The implementation of LAud is particularly valuable in addressing the complex risk landscape of power-grid projects. Effective lifecycle risk management requires integrated systems capable of processing technical, environmental, and financial data streams—a capability inherent in LAud frameworks13. Adoption success depends on technological readiness, regulatory alignment, and organizational culture30,31. Recent studies highlight LAud’s growing relevance in critical infrastructure sectors, where it enhances resilience through continuous compliance monitoring and predictive analytics12,32.

Audit of power grid projects

The audit of power grid projects constitutes a critical mechanism for ensuring operational efficiency, regulatory compliance, and sustainable development in the energy sector. Various dimensions of power-grid auditing emphasize the integration of technical and financial oversight33, while the role of energy audits in optimizing household electricity consumption in Amman, Jordan—a framework adaptable to broader distribution network efficiency34. Zhou et al.35 advanced risk assessment methodologies through a two-layer neural network model capable of processing multi-attribute, low-correlation data, addressing a key challenge in auditing complex infrastructure projects.

LAud extends these foundations by embedding continuous, technology-driven oversight across all project phases. Abdel-Hadi et al.36 laid groundwork for this approach through a holistic audit framework that synthesizes financial, technical, and operational metrics—principles now operationalized in LAud through real-time data integration from SCADA systems, IoT sensors, and project management platforms. Energy performance indicators gain enhanced relevance in LAud frameworks37, where they are dynamically tracked against evolving benchmarks. Early innovations in automation, such as intelligent auditing system38, foreshadowed LAud’s reliance on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to minimize human error and accelerate anomaly detection33,39,40.

Diverging from prior literature, this research investigates the implementation of LAud based on a full lifecycle model that integrates:

Design-phase risk forecasting using predictive analytics.

Construction-phase compliance tracking via IoT-enabled progress monitoring.

Operational-phase resilience auditing through SCADA system interoperability.

Post-completion performance evaluation with machine learning-driven benchmarks.

This framework is underpinned by collaborative digital ecosystems that unify stakeholders—engineers, auditors, and policymakers—on shared data platforms. By demonstrating LAud’s capacity to synchronize technical specifications (e.g., substation load thresholds) with financial constraints (e.g., budget allocations), our work addresses a critical gap identified by Bosu et al. (2023)41 in aligning engineering priorities with fiscal accountability. Furthermore, the study elucidates how LAud’s proactive risk identification mechanisms, leveraging AI-augmented analysis of operational logs and environmental data, mitigate the systemic vulnerabilities in power transmission systems13.

Lifecyle audit challenges in power grid projects

As power-grid projects escalate in scale and complexity, traditional auditing approaches struggle to address the multifaceted challenges of modern infrastructure development. These challenges underscore the imperative for adopting LAud frameworks that integrate continuous monitoring and predictive analytics.

Current practices disproportionately focus on post-completion financial reviews, neglecting critical front-end nodes such as design validation, procurement oversight, and contractor selection35. This fragmented approach fails to detect risks embedded in early project phases, such as design flaws or bid-rigging, which later manifest as cost overruns or operational failures13. LAud addresses this gap through real-time monitoring of all lifecycle stages, leveraging IoT-enabled progress tracking and predictive modeling to identify deviations during design and construction25. For instance, SCADA system interoperability allows auditors to validate equipment specifications against live operational data, ensuring alignment between design intent and implementation36.

Audit findings often remain siloed within departmental boundaries, lacking integration with strategic decision-making processes. This disconnection stems from inadequate digital infrastructure to disseminate insights across engineering, finance, and risk management teams26. LAud transforms audit outcomes into actionable intelligence by deploying centralized digital platforms that automate report generation and distribute findings to stakeholders in real time. Machine learning algorithms33 enable predictive risk scoring, allowing preemptive interventions in procurement or contractor performance. Furthermore, blockchain-based audit trails32, enhance transparency in corrective action tracking, addressing the feedback loop deficiencies41.

Last but not least, the exponential growth of audit scope—spanning environmental compliance, cybersecurity, and supply chain ethics—has strained traditional audit teams39. While outsourcing to intermediaries temporarily alleviates resource shortages, it introduces governance gaps, such as inconsistent data standards and misaligned incentives12. LAud mitigates these issues through digitalization-driven automation, reducing manual workloads by 40–60% in routine compliance checks40. For example, natural language processing tools audit contractual documents against regulatory databases, while computer vision systems validate construction milestones via drone-captured imagery. This shift enables internal teams to focus on high-value tasks like fraud pattern analysis and resilience stress-testing, aligning with the proactive risk culture30.

By transitioning from reactive compliance checks to a lifecycle assurance model, power-grid enterprises can reduce project risks at early stages, as evidenced by pilot implementations in state-owned utilities37,38. This evolution positions LAud not merely as an audit methodology but as a cornerstone of sustainable infrastructure governance.

This study employed a qualitative case study approach to investigate the implementation of a full-process LAud model within a state-owned organization’s internal audit framework. The research focused on managing power-grid projects and controlling risks throughout the project lifecycle, using 29 completed power-grid projects in 2023 as the primary empirical context. This case study design was selected to enable an in-depth exploration of the LAud framework’s operational dynamics and its alignment with audit needs throughout the project lifecycle.

Data collection and analysis

The primary data were collected through two methods, namely, document analysis and expert interviews. Regarding the document analysis, a purposive sample of the completed power-grid projects was selected based on their relevance to the LAud framework’s implementation. Internal audit reports, project records, and post-audit evaluations were systematically reviewed to identify patterns in governance practices, digital tool utilization, and audit outcomes42. Meanwhile, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 11 stakeholders, including internal auditors, project managers, IT specialists, and senior executives involved in the power-grid company as shown in Table 1. Interviews focused on validating the framework’s efficacy, uncovering challenges in collaborative governance, and evaluating the role of digital tools in enhancing audit transparency and efficiency.

The interviewees were selected purposively to capture audit perspectives from the 29 completed power-grid projects. Selection criteria for these interviewees were (a) direct involvement in at least one of the completed power-grid projects and (b) functional role in internal audit, project management, IT systems, or executive oversight, and with a minimum of five years’ experience. Recruitment continued until thematic saturation was reached—no new concepts emerged after the ninth interview, and two confirmatory interviews were added, yielding the final sample of 11 stakeholders.

Thematic analysis was then applied to documentary and interview data. Iterative code development focused on project lifecycle stages. Interview transcripts were triangulated with project documentation for consistency and reliability. Emerging patterns were mapped to the LAud framework’s theoretical foundations, with discrepancies resolved through research team discussions.

Case study context, LAud framework Implementation, and digital platform development

The study was conducted at State Grid Jiangsu Electric Power Company, a prominent provincial power grid company within the State Grid Corporation of China. This state-owned enterprise was deliberately chosen because such organizations are both the dominant investors in China’s power-grid infrastructure and subject to stringent public-sector auditing standards, thereby providing a high-stakes, high-visibility environment in which the benefits and constraints of a full-process LAud model can be rigorously examined and transparently validated. This company plays a crucial role in the region’s energy infrastructure, overseeing 13 municipal and 59 county-level branches, and serving a substantial customer base of over 50.77 million. In 2023, the company successfully completed 29 power-grid projects, which provided a rich empirical context for developing and testing the LAud framework.

The power-grid projects were located across different geographical areas within Jiangsu Province, including urban centers, suburban regions, and rural areas. This geographical diversity posed unique challenges in terms of environmental conditions, land acquisition, and coordination with local stakeholders. For instance, projects in urban areas had to navigate complex underground utility networks and meet higher safety and environmental standards, while rural projects faced challenges related to transportation of materials and limited local infrastructure support.

The company operates in a highly regulated and dynamic environment, with increasing demands for power supply reliability and quality. It faces intense competition in the electricity market and growing expectations from customers and regulators regarding project cost-effectiveness, environmental sustainability, and social responsibility. These factors made the power-grid projects not only technically challenging but also strategically critical for the company’s long-term development and reputation.

The successful completion of these projects was essential for enhancing the power supply capacity, improving grid stability, and supporting the economic growth of the region. However, the projects also carried significant risks, such as cost overruns, schedule delays, and quality issues, which necessitated effective governance and risk control mechanisms.

Against this backdrop, the study proposed a holistic LAud framework covering six critical stages of power-grid projects’ lifecycle after expert verification: Project Initiation, Survey and Design, Bidding, Tendering and Procurement, Implementation of Engineering Project, Engineering Completion, and Post-Completion Audit.

Throughout the pilot program, the company developed a new workflow to streamline the audit process. This workflow incorporated the principles of the LAud framework and emphasized mid-process and pre-process engagement. It involved various stages, from audit planning and implementation to reporting and follow-up, ensuring continuous tracking and on-site audits throughout the construction process.

Post-pilot, a fully functional digital LAud platform was developed to support the implementation of the LAud framework. This platform enhanced off-site data analysis for engineering audits, characterized by “full-volume scanning, precise positioning, systematic analysis, and focused verification” to accurately identify project issues. It automatically collected data across three layers: decision-making, business, and support, providing a comprehensive digital solution for auditing power-grid projects.

The current study provides an in-depth exploration of implementing the LAud framework in a state-owned power-grid enterprise. By offering detailed insights into the case study background and implementation process, the study highlights the practical application and effectiveness of the LAud framework in enhancing project governance and sustainability through continuous auditing practices and digital innovation.

Backgrounds and cases

State Grid Jiangsu Electric Power Company was selected as the power-grid enterprise in this study, which is a preeminent provincial power grid company within the State Grid Corporation of China. In 2023, they had completed 29 power-grid projects, which were used as the main source of data for developing the LAud framework. Some of the completed power-grid projects included Yangzhou Power Supply Branch Maintenance Facility Project, Zhenjiang Junbei 110 kV Substation Expansion, Nantong Haidong 110 kV Substation Expansion, Qidong Yongyang 220 kV Substation Supporting Grid Project, and so on as illustrated in Fig. 1.

In its pursuit of operational excellence and risk management, they implemented a comprehensive auditing strategy tailored to different types of projects. This strategy ensured rigorous oversight throughout the project lifecycle. Particularly, the tender control price, a critical component of project cost management, was identified as a key focus area for the process tracking management audit, with a separate and detailed audit report issued to provide transparent and actionable insights. These data served as useful information and references in clarifying the process involved in LAud.

Development of LAud framework

As a result, a holistic LAud framework is proposed that covers various critical stages of power-grid projects’ lifecycle after verifying the details with the experts in the company. Figure 2 illustrates the details of the LAud framework. The details of each stage and how they should be implemented in power-grid projects throughout the project lifecycle are as follows:

I.

Stage 1: Project Initiation.

The project initiation stage establishes the foundational framework for power grid development by addressing planning approvals, feasibility study reviews, and compliance with regulatory prerequisites. During this phase, project teams prepare and submit documentation for land use pre-approval, policy alignment, and investment plan formulation. Auditors rigorously evaluate adherence to national policies and corporate governance mandates, ensuring procedural legality, transparency in fund allocation, and alignment with strategic decisions issued by the organization’s leadership. Emphasis is placed on verifying that pre-construction conditions, such as environmental clearances and stakeholder consultations, are fully satisfied before advancing to subsequent stages.

II.

Stage 2: Survey and Design.

The survey and design phase focuses on translating conceptual plans into actionable engineering blueprints. Engineers develop preliminary designs and construction drawings, which undergo iterative reviews to optimize technical specifications, cost efficiency, and safety protocols. Auditors assess the adequacy of geological surveys, structural calculations, and risk mitigation strategies embedded within the designs, ensuring alignment with industry standards and project objectives. This stage also involves oversight of third-party design contractors to prevent deviations from approved parameters. Critical attention is directed toward identifying discrepancies between design iterations and their implications for project timelines, budgets, and operational resilience.

III.

Stage 3: Bidding, Tendering and Procurement.

During the procurement phase, project managers formulate bidding strategies, draft procurement documents, and evaluate vendor qualifications to secure cost-effective and compliant contracts. Auditors monitor the entire procurement lifecycle, from bid solicitation to contract execution, to prevent irregularities such as collusion, inflated pricing, or non-competitive practices. A key audit activity involves comparing winning bid prices with pre-established control benchmarks to detect anomalies. Additionally, auditors scrutinize the fairness of bid evaluation criteria, the accuracy of technical specifications, and the integrity of award decisions. Post-award audits ensure that contractual terms, including delivery schedules and quality guarantees, are explicitly defined and legally binding.

IV.

Stage 4: Implementation of Engineering Project.

The implementation phase prioritizes adherence to safety regulations, contractual obligations, and environmental safeguards. Auditors conduct on-site inspections to verify compliance with land acquisition protocols, migrant worker wage disbursements, and construction quality standards. They validate work volumes through physical measurements, particularly for concealed elements like underground foundations, and assess the legitimacy of design changes or cost adjustments. Contractual deviations, such as unauthorized subcontracting or unapproved scope expansions, are flagged to mitigate financial and operational risks.

Material audits ensure traceability and quality control across the supply chain. Auditors review equipment supervision logs, material distribution records, and storage practices to prevent losses or misuse. They verify tax compliance in material settlements and investigate discrepancies such as inflated procurement costs or off-book inventory. Special attention is given to the disposal of surplus or scrap materials to ensure compliance with waste management regulations.

Financial oversight focuses on budget adherence, tax accountability, and fraud prevention. Auditors reconcile expenditures against feasibility estimates, design budgets, and final settlements to detect overruns. Pre-audit mechanisms are applied to critical payments, including land compensation and contractor invoices, to block unauthorized fund diversion. Rigorous reviews of affiliated entities’ expenses, such as subcontractors or design consultants, further safeguard against fraudulent accounting practices. Ensuring compliance in settlement management and providing a sufficient basis for settlements are also critical. To maintain financial transparency and prevent misuse, pre-audit processes are implemented at various payment stages, including land compensation, construction payments, and material payments. Furthermore, extended audits are conducted on the cost expenditures of affiliated construction, design, and supervisory units. This comprehensive approach helps preventing the establishment of unauthorized funds, commonly referred to as “slush funds,” ensuring that all financial activities are legitimate and properly accounted for.

V.

Stage 5: Engineering Completion.

The completion phase involves a two-tier audit process to finalize project costs and validate deliverables. The settlement audit cross-references completed work with contractual terms through document reviews and on-site inspections, verifying labor costs, material consumption, and scope deviations. The final account audit then reconciles initial budgets with actual expenditures, ensuring adherence to approved scales and timelines. Auditors confirm asset registrations and financial closures, formally certifying the project’s readiness for operational handover.

VI.

Stage 6: Post Completion Audit.

The post-completion audit evaluates the project’s long-term viability and societal impact. Auditors analyze economic returns, environmental sustainability, and grid reliability to identify inefficiencies in planning or execution. Recommendations are formulated to enhance future investment decisions, optimize asset utilization, and align projects with regional development goals. This retrospective assessment ensures accountability, fosters continuous improvement, and strengthens the alignment of power grid investments with national energy strategies.

Testing of LAud framework and proposal of additional workflow

After acceptance of the Laud framework by the power-grid company, a pilot program was initiated to implement full-process auditing using the principles in the LAud framework. This initiative expanded audit supervision to cover the entire project lifecycle, from the initial stages of planning, scheduling, and procurement, through construction, completion, and eventual operation. By adopting an interventionist approach that emphasized mid-process and pre-process engagement, the company carried out ongoing tracking and on-site audits throughout the construction process. As a result, a new workflow was developed to further streamline the audit process. The workflow is illustrated in Fig. 3.

During the project initiation phase, the company’s audit department developed an audit work plan based on the annual audit project schedule. In the audit implementation phase, the audit department formed an audit team as required and issued an audit notice to the audited enterprise, which acknowledged receipt. The audit team then prepared an audit implementation plan, conducting pre-audit surveys when necessary to define the audit scope and focus. On-site audits began with an opening meeting, during which the audited enterprise was expected to provide full cooperation. The audit team conducted the on-site audit, generating audit records and working papers, while the audited enterprise supplied the necessary documents and confirmed the accuracy of the working papers. The audit team also conducted interviews as needed, and the audit department provided project guidance when required.

In the audit report phase, the audit team drafted interim audit reports based on the findings from the on-site audit, and the audited enterprise implemented corrective actions accordingly. After project completion, the audit team prepared the engineering tracking audit report, incorporating insights from both on-site and interim reports and seeking input from relevant departments. Management recommendations were provided based on identified issues, and the audit department reviewed the report before finalizing it. The final audit report was then shared with the audited enterprise for feedback before being officially delivered.

In the post-report phase, the audited unit was responsible for implementing the recommended audit corrections and submitting a detailed feedback report to the audit department. Upon receiving the feedback, the audit department archived all audit project materials in accordance with established requirements, thereby concluding the audit process.

Overall, the new workflow had streamlined the auditing process and strengthened risk mitigation strategies, ensuring that projects were completed successfully and in compliance with established standards and regulations. It also facilitated the timely identification and rectification of issues, significantly enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of project management.

Digital platform of LAud

After successful completion of the pilot program, a full-functional digital platform of LAud was developed to realize all required processes in the practice. It would increase the depth and breadth of off-site data analysis for engineering audit, delving deeper into the value of data. This platform serves as a comprehensive digital audit approach characterized by “full-volume scanning, precise positioning, systematic analysis, and focused verification” to accurately identify issues within engineering projects. It allowed for a comprehensive understanding of the trends in problem risks, providing a basis for targeted tasks in engineering audit. It could automatically collect the necessary data based on three main layers, namely, decision-making layer, business layer and support layer.

The digital platform of LAud is built on a robust technical architecture that ensures seamless integration with existing enterprise systems. It incorporates advanced integration mechanisms to connect with systems such as ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) and BIM (Building Information Modeling), enabling smooth data exchange and collaboration. The platform employs standardized interfaces and data protocols to ensure compatibility and efficient data flow between systems. This integration allows for real-time data sharing, eliminating information silos and enhancing the overall efficiency of project management and auditing processes.

In terms of cybersecurity, the platform implements multiple layers of security measures to protect sensitive project and financial data. These include encryption of data in transit and at rest, strict access controls based on user roles and permissions, and continuous monitoring for potential threats. The platform also undergoes regular security audits and vulnerability assessments to ensure its resilience against evolving cyber threats.

The technical roadmap of the digital platform of LAud is shown in Fig. 4.

Decision-making layer

The decision making level played a pivotal role in offering high - level guidance and devising strategic plans for audit work in the digital platform. The project analysis module conducted an in - depth examination of various aspects of engineering projects. Cost - benefit analysis was performed to evaluate whether the benefits justified the costs. Schedule control was implemented to ensure projects were completed in a timely manner. Risk assessment was carried out to identify potential threats and develop mitigation strategies. The accountability analysis module functioned to ensure clear assignment of responsibility during the audit process. It accurately identified any violations, enhancing transparency and accountability. The issue analysis module was dedicated to pinpointing and analyzing potential problems within engineering projects, allowing for early detection and mitigation of issues. The talent analysis module assessed the capabilities of the audit team. It ensured that audit tasks were executed by individuals with the right skills and knowledge, sometimes even prompting the organization to tailor training programs and professional development initiatives to enhance the skills of the staff.

Business layer

The business layer constituted the central component of the digital audit platform, directly facilitating the execution of audit workflows. For example, the project management module structured the audit lifecycle by encompassing initiation, planning, execution, and monitoring phases. It ensured adherence to predefined objectives and standards through embedded governance frameworks, enabling systematic progress tracking and resource allocation. The rectification management module prioritized issue resolution through a structured feedback loop. Identified discrepancies were logged, tracked, and validated against corrective actions, ensuring accountability and timely remediation. Collectively, these modules synergized to enhance audit efficiency, compliance, and transparency. The business layer’s architecture not only digitized manual processes but also embedded continuous improvement mechanisms, positioning the platform as a scalable solution for evolving audit demands.

Support layer

In the completed platform, the support layer played a crucial in role providing essential backing and resources for the audit work.

The audit knowledge base functioned as a repository. It contained policy regulations, issue classification libraries, and standard working paper templates, serving as a reference and guidance source for auditors. The outcomes repository was utilized to store audit records, issue databases, and international reference materials, supplying historical data and case analyses for future audits. The data resource library, which included a data resource catalog, data quality management, data application scenarios, and data access management, ensured the accuracy and security of audit data.

Within the support and assurance module, the audit knowledge base was divided into a standards library and an outcomes library. The standards library was composed of policy and regulation databases, issue classification libraries, standard working paper templates, template libraries, audit task libraries, standard record templates, audit matter libraries, audit system guidance libraries, rectification standard libraries, regulatory penalty libraries, and rectification standard libraries. The outcomes library consisted of audit case libraries, project material libraries, working paper libraries, audit record libraries, issue libraries, entity material libraries, audit label libraries, audit training libraries, and international reference libraries. It is worth noting that the audit training library had been planned to be launched in the third phase of the platform.

In summary, the digital audit platform had been designed with a multi - role workstation approach, empowered stakeholders to access particular functions and information in line with their needs. This not only enhanced the efficiency and quality of the audit work but also, through in - depth data analysis and mining, lent strong support and assurance to engineering project management. Figure 5 illustrates the main interface of the digital platform of LAud.

Challenges and achievements of the LAud framework

The case study on implementing the LAud framework at State Grid Jiangsu Electric Power Company faced several challenges. The power-grid projects’ complexity, varying in scale and technical requirements, demanded auditors to possess extensive technical and managerial knowledge. For instance, substation expansion required coordinating multiple technical systems, while smart grid implementation needed advanced technology integration. Additionally, data integration from diverse sources like project management software and financial systems was hindered by inconsistency and incompatibility, necessitating unified data standards. Resistance to change from staff accustomed to traditional auditing also posed a challenge, requiring extensive communication and training. Ensuring the digital platform’s security and stability was another critical concern, demanding significant investment in cybersecurity measures.

However, the LAud framework also brings remarkable achievements. In 2023, State Grid Jiangsu Electric Power Company audited 111,400 engineering projects, covering a total investment of 78.047 billion yuan, and achieved cost savings and revenue increments of 2.902 billion yuan through measures such as reducing engineering costs. The full-process auditing work not only enhanced the efficiency and quality of audits but also significantly improved the management level of engineering projects and the efficiency of fund utilization. Furthermore, the LAud framework played a crucial role in these achievements by providing comprehensive oversight throughout the project lifecycle, enabling early issue identification and risk reduction. The digital platform significantly improved audit efficiency through automated data analysis and report generation, allowing for more accurate and timely project issue identification. The framework strengthened risk control by enabling proactive risk monitoring and mitigation strategies across all project stages, minimizing potential losses. It also supported the company’s sustainability goals by ensuring environmental compliance and efficient resource utilization. The post-completion audit offered insights into projects’ long-term viability and societal impact, guiding future investment decisions. Furthermore, the digital platform marked a significant step in the company’s digital transformation, demonstrating how technology can enhance traditional auditing practices. Finally, the framework fostered better collaboration among stakeholders, improving communication and coordination among various roles within the company.

Theoretical contributions

This research has made significant strides in exploring the application of LAud in power-grid projects. Through a qualitative case study approach, we examined the implementation of a full-process LAud model within a state-owned organization’s internal audit framework. The study analyzed data from 29 completed power-grid projects and incorporated expert interviews to validate the framework and investigate collaborative governance mechanisms and digital empowerment strategies. The core outcome is the development of a comprehensive LAud framework that covers all critical stages of power-grid projects’ lifecycle, from initiation to post-completion audit. This framework has been tested and refined through a pilot program, leading to the creation of a new workflow and a fully functional digital platform for LAud. The results demonstrate that LAud can enhance project governance and sustainability by enabling real-time monitoring, proactive risk mitigation, and continuous data integration, thereby addressing the limitations of traditional auditing methods.

The study advances theoretical discourse by redefining lifecycle auditing as a dynamic, technology-driven governance mechanism rather than a static compliance tool. Traditional auditing frameworks, as critiqued, often prioritize periodic financial reviews, neglecting operational risks embedded in early project phases23. By contrast, this research operationalizes LAud as a holistic system that embeds real-time assurance across design, procurement, construction, and operational stages—a paradigm shift aligning the call for resilience-oriented auditing in critical infrastructure32. The integration of SCADA systems and IoT sensors for compliance tracking extends foundational work on continuous auditing25, bridging the gap between financial reporting and engineering integrity. Furthermore, the framework’s emphasis on predictive analytics for risk forecasting (e.g., design-phase anomalies) responds to advocacy for AI-enhanced evaluation methods in power projects14. This contribution repositions LAud as a cornerstone of sustainable infrastructure governance, harmonizing technical specifications with fiscal accountability.

The second theoretical contribution lies in elucidating the role of collaborative digital ecosystems in overcoming siloed audit practices. Prior studies, such as those by Zhou et al.35, identified fragmented oversight as a key barrier to infrastructure risk management. This research demonstrates how LAud’s digital platform fosters interdisciplinary collaboration among engineers, auditors, and policymakers through shared data interfaces and automated reporting. By aligning real-time audit findings with strategic decision-making, the framework operationalizes the “collaborative assurance” concept proposed by Wahdan et al.31, which emphasizes cross-functional transparency. These findings extend holistic audit model36 by embedding stakeholder synergy into lifecycle governance, thereby addressing the feedback loop deficiencies.

The third theoretical contribution is the exploration of the digital empowerment mechanisms within the LAud framework. This research highlights the critical role of technology in enhancing audit efficiency and effectiveness. The developed digital platform for LAud incorporates advanced technologies such as IoT sensors, SCADA systems, and machine learning algorithms. These technologies enable high-frequency audit cycles aligned with project milestones, automated monitoring of technical, financial, and operational parameters, and exception-based auditing supplemented by human expertise for complex judgments25. The platform also supports continuous data modeling using inputs from various sources, providing real-time assurance over both financial and non-financial performance indicators. This technological integration addresses the limitations of traditional auditing methods, which often struggle with the dynamic and complex nature of power-grid projects23,43. The digital empowerment mechanisms developed in this study provide a theoretical foundation for how technology can transform audit practices in critical infrastructure sectors.

Practical implementations

The implementation of the LAud framework can lead to improved project governance and sustainability by enabling proactive risk identification and immediate corrective actions throughout the project lifecycle. For project managers and auditors, the framework provides a structured approach to tracking progress against planned schedules, budgets, and quality benchmarks, facilitating better decision-making. The digital platform developed in this study offers a scalable solution for continuous auditing and enhances the accuracy and timeliness of audit reports. This can result in significant cost savings and improved project outcomes. Additionally, the collaborative governance mechanisms within the LAud framework promote transparency and accountability among stakeholders, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and alignment with organizational goals.

The LAud framework has enormous potential for widespread application. It can be adapted for use in other types of organizations and industries, though some modifications may be necessary. State-owned enterprises typically prioritize regulatory compliance, public accountability, and long-term societal impacts, aligning with centralized governance structures. In contrast, private enterprises often emphasize cost efficiency, shareholder returns, and agile decision-making, necessitating streamlined audit workflows and faster return-on-investment justification. For example, private enterprises may need to adjust the framework to suit their unique governance models and operational dynamics. Future development of LAud should consider the different needs in private enterprises, while retaining its core principles of real-time monitoring and proactive risk management during its implementation.

The implementation of the LAud framework may encounter several obstacles, such as high costs, training demands, and organizational resistance to innovation. Organizations might be reluctant to invest in new technologies and training programs due to budget constraints. Additionally, integrating the LAud digital platform with existing systems like ERP and BIM can be complex. To address these issues, organizations should conduct thorough cost-benefit analyses to demonstrate the long-term advantages of adopting LAud. Developing comprehensive training programs and effective change management strategies can help overcome resistance and ensure a smooth implementation process.

When compared to other contemporary audit models, the LAud framework offers several advantages. Traditional audit models typically focus on periodic financial reviews, often overlooking operational risks across project phases. In contrast, this framework provides continuous, real-time monitoring across all project stages, from design to operation. This holistic approach enables early risk detection and timely corrective actions. While other models may offer valuable insights, LAud uniquely combines technical, financial, and operational data using advanced technologies like IoT sensors and machine learning algorithms, providing a more comprehensive view of project performance. The framework’s emphasis on proactive risk mitigation and continuous improvement further distinguishes it from models that primarily rely on post-hoc analysis. These features make the LAud framework a superior choice for auditing complex infrastructure projects.",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-025-20389-9/MediaObjects/41598_2025_20389_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2025-10-17 17:07:47.615205

Energy Northwest, a Washington State-based joint action agency, unveiled the official name and new images of its proposed SMR facility in Washington state, marking a milestone one year after announcing its partnership with X-energy and Amazon.

The proposed project – now officially called Cascade Advanced Energy Facility – is poised to be the first SMR in the Pacific Northwest.

“Today marks a pivotal step forward in bringing this transformative project to life,” said Bob Schuetz, CEO of Energy Northwest. “We are proud to be at the forefront of deploying advanced nuclear technology in the region -- driving next-generation solutions that strengthen energy security and position the Pacific Northwest as a clean energy leader.”

Since the 2024 announcement, Energy Northwest has focused on engagement with stakeholders and Tribal Nations, conducting environmental reviews, safety evaluations, permitting, licensing and risk analyses to prepare for a construction permit application to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

These ongoing activities are laying the groundwork for delivering reliable, around-the-clock, carbon-free energy to meet the region’s rising energy demands, Energy Northwest said.

Energy Northwest has also selected AtkinsRéalis as the project’s technical advisor, drawing on the company’s extensive technical and operational expertise.

Additionally, Energy Northwest has acquired an Energy Learning Center in collaboration with Columbia Basin College and with funding from the DOE’s Community Capacity Building Grant Program.

The Energy Learning Center, which will be located at Washington State University’s Institute for Northwest Energy Futures campus and will include a simulator that replicates X-energy's control room.

This education simulator, which will be operational later this year, will give students hands-on experience with the technology that will power X-energy's Xe-100 reactors.

Energy Northwest’s Cascade Advanced Energy Facility is projected to generate 320 megawatts of energy, and when fully built out, up to 960 MW.

It is also expected to create more than 1,000 temporary construction jobs during construction and over 100 permanent family-wage positions once operational, spanning nuclear operations, engineering and other specialized fields.

The project’s timeline is expected to follow X-energy and Dow’s first-of-a-kind deployment of the same reactor technology for the Long Mott Generating Station project in Seadrift, Texas, part of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program.",https://www.publicpower.org/themes/custom/appa_foundation/favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-17 20:08:44.459792

We just wrapped up the IUCN World Conservation Congress in Abu Dhabi, after a packed, inspirational and exhausting seven days, working with passionate and knowledgeable advocates for nature from across the globe, within and beyond the BirdLife Partnership.

Dr Lesley Dickie, Executive Vice President for Conservation and the Regions at BirdLife International, said:

“Bringing thousands of conservationists together, the IUCN World Conservation Congress has stimulated vital debate about how we shape our world. It is an ever more important imperative that open dialogue takes place when the stakes are so high. The IUCN Congress gives space for the conversations we must have to save our precious nature. Now, we get back to action.”

The Congress in numbers:

Over 10,000 participants with representation from more than 45 BirdLife Partners (totalling over 80 BirdLife Partnership delegates)

147 resolutions adopted (and 17 motions co-sponsored by BirdLife Partnership)

1,360 bird species reassessed as part of the IUCN Red List Update

100+ new IUCN Members welcomed, including six new State Members

100+ Indigenous Leaders gathered for landmark World Summit

New IUCN leadership (2026-2029) elected with various BirdLife Partners and supporters on board

A unique forum happening only every four years, the Congress is a big deal for the future of our planet. The world’s largest and most influential gathering on nature, it brought together around 10,000 participants from governments, civil society, Indigenous Peoples’ organisations, donors, academia and business. Together we raised the alarm on pressing threats to nature, highlighted solutions and innovations, and set the agenda for policy and action on the ground, endorsing a new 20-year vision for the Union.

The BirdLife Partnership – the world’s oldest and largest global partnership for nature, with 123 national NGO Partners around the world – was there in force, with more than 80 staff from over 45 IUCN Member/BirdLife Partners joining forces for nature. This is always the biggest BirdLife delegation we see in any global meeting, which allows us to catch up with each other as a Partnership and to learn from what is working in different parts of the world.

Taking stock halfway to 2030

This Congress came at a key juncture, midway to 2030. It was a moment to take stock of progress toward the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, the Paris Agreement on Climate, and the Sustainable Development Goals. The ongoing geopolitics and financial climate continue to challenge the current operating environment. However, an emergency motion reaffirming the importance of IUCN’s role in multilateralism and international cooperation highlighted the need for us to work together. It called on us to underscore the importance of nature as the foundation of economies and societies, and to make clear the links to climate ahead of the COP30 climate talks in Brazil next month.

The power of many: scale and collaboration

We at BirdLife went into the Congress having launched an incredibly exciting new partnership with the World Bank, working with a strategic network of more than 50 of our Partners to scale up implementation and innovative finance for nature across the Africa-Eurasia flyway. It’s exactly this idea of scale and collaboration, which is at the heart of IUCN, BirdLife and our wider partnerships, that are needed to deliver action and finance at the necessary scale and pace to reverse the loss of biodiversity by 2030.

The BirdLife Partnership was involved in events across the Forum, which took place on the first days of the Congress, and co-sponsored 17 motions. These were discussed in groups and then voted on in the Members’ Assembly over the final three days.

Highlighting issues and showcasing solutions

Many motions and events highlighted key issues and solutions relating to species, sites, systems and society and covering science, partnership, advocacy, and implementation. With the latest update of the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species revealing increasing declines in birds and other taxa, we highlighted how citizen science, such as birding, can help us understand the status and trends of birds and biodiversity to inform policy and action.

Like BirdLife, IUCN continues to champion species and the importance of species data, which underpins some of the critical knowledge products (including the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and Key Biodiversity Areas) and tools (such as IBAT – the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool, AVISTEP – the Avian Sensitivity for Energy Planning, and TESSA – the Toolkit for Ecosystem Service Site-Based Assessment), that help guide conservation and development to ensure optimal and efficient outcomes for nature, climate and people.

Throughout the Congress, we highlighted some of the big initiatives that apply this knowledge and experience together with on-ground expertise through our Partners. We shared insights about our regional flyways initiatives and the Conserva Aves initiative focused on identifying, designating and effectively managing locally-led protected and conserved areas across 11 countries in the Americas. We also talked about our Forest Impact Accelerator initiative, which has just received funding from the UK government to establish sustainable finance initiatives in priority tropical forest landscapes to help secure 1 million hectares of Key Biodiversity Areas alongside economic benefits for 200,000 local people.

We held a side-meeting of the Convention on Migratory Species Energy Task Force, which we coordinate, where we discussed and showcased ways to achieve a just renewable energy transition that contributes to both net zero and nature positive global goals. And we discussed how our new Nature Action Tracker can hold governments to account, understand what works and incentivise efforts, and shared our new guidance on just and effective engagement in landscape restoration.

The business-end of the Congress

One of the most important outcomes of the Congress is the discussion and agreement of motions, which, if passed, become resolutions or recommendations and guide the work and advocacy of the Union over the coming quadrennium. IUCN members passed 147 motions in total, 97 through an electronic vote last month, and the remainder following discussions in small ‘contact groups’ and when necessary, in plenary before being taken to the vote. While emotions ran high on some, with varying opinions reflecting the diversity of IUCN, the tone remained civil and constructive, enabling compromise to be reached in nearly every case.

Successful motions covered a wide range of issues. We proposed one which passed through the e-vote on ensuring companies disclose and take action to minimise negative impacts on biodiversity in ways that will achieve the goals of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (KMGBF). This highlights the importance of global biodiversity data, such as the IUCN Red List and Key Biodiversity Areas, in helping to guide both development and conservation. It also links to other motions on the need for businesses, sectors such as renewable energy and mechanisms such as biodiversity credits to contribute to the nature positive global goal, which is aligned with the KMGBF mission of halting and reversing the loss of biodiversity by 2030.

Christine Dragisic, Managing Director of Global Policy at Audubon Society (one of our BirdLife Partners in the US) added: “The IUCN World Conservation Congress 2025 was a powerful reminder of what’s possible when we work together for nature. It was inspiring for Audubon to stand alongside our BirdLife partners to showcase innovative conservation and advance resolutions that will benefit birds, people, and the planet across the Americas and beyond.”

Several motions debated and voted on at the Congress focused on area-based conservation. They called for stronger protections against unsustainable tourism, such as the proposal from PPNEA, our Partner in Albania. Other motions addressed the protection of seamounts, the integrity of mesopelagic ecosystems in the oceans, and forest integrity in the Congo Basin. Together, these efforts highlighted the need to deliver both the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the ‘30×30’ target of the KMGBF — to effectively and equitably protect and conserve at least 30% of terrestrial, inland water, coastal, and marine areas by 2030. This includes key areas for biodiversity and ecosystem services, while also beginning to look ahead to more ambitious targets beyond 2030.

There were also several motions relating to the rights of nature, as well as one calling for recognition of the crime of ecocide – interesting developments which would provide additional legal channels to protect nature.

Finally, key motions supporting the non-proliferation of fossil fuels (and an urgent, just, nature-positive renewable energy transition), the need to address plastic pollution following the collapse of negotiations to agree a plastics treaty, and the endorsement of an IUCN policy on synthetic biology provide a strong legacy of this Congress.

Joseph Onoja, Director General of the Nigerian Conservation Foundation, said:

“From over 40 countries, one flock, one purpose. At the IUCN World Conservation Congress, BirdLife Partners stood united — speaking for nature, people, and the planet we all share.

It was, as always, a great pleasure to join the BirdLife flock at the IUCN World Conservation Congress. We demonstrated remarkable camaraderie, working with clear purpose and unity. Together, we supported motions that not only strengthen the work of IUCN but also advance our shared mission to conserve nature and improve the wellbeing of people.”

Dive Brief:

A coalition of 22 states and the District of Columbia on Wednesday sued the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin for ending the $7 billion Solar for All Program.

Separately, a coalition of 24 Solar for All grant recipients on Tuesday filed a breach-of-contract complaint in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims to recover damages for the EPA’s termination of Solar for All grants.

The states’ legal actions follow similar lawsuits filed Monday by Harris County, Texas, and last week by solar companies and community and labor groups arguing that the EPA’s termination of the Solar for All program strips local governments of critical clean energy funding

Dive Insight:

The lawsuit, filed by 22 states in U.S. District Court in the Western District of Washington, alleges the EPA has “unilaterally and illegally terminated a multi-billion-dollar program designed to bring low-cost distributed solar energy to over 900,000 households in low-income and disadvantaged communities.”

The EPA abruptly ended the Solar for All program, created under the Clean Air Act’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to help low-income communities adopt clean energy, as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in July, the plaintiffs said in the court filing.

Because all $7 billion in Solar for All grants had already been obligated by August 2024 — before the OBBBA became law — the plaintiffs contend the EPA acted illegally by terminating the program and blocking access to their awarded funds, the states contend.

“Plaintiffs relied upon the SFA Program to meet benchmarks for clean energy production, to create jobs, to limit environmental damage caused by pollutants, and to generate energy cost savings for households, including in low-income and disadvantaged communities,” the lawsuit states.

The attorneys general of Arizona, Minnesota and Washington are leading the complaint, which was joined by the attorneys general of California, Colorado, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Hawaiʻi, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont. The governors of Kentucky and Pennsylvania, as well as the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation, also joined the complaint.

Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said in a statement that the EPA awarded the funds, which were created by Congress, so Connecticut could help low-income residents save millions of dollars on their energy bills. “Trump cannot unilaterally reverse course now, and we’re suing to make sure Connecticut gets every penny we are owed,” he said.

Connecticut was awarded $62.5 million last year in Solar for All funding to increase access to solar and energy storage for low-income communities, including multifamily affordable housing.

″As public servants, it is incumbent upon us to fight for fairness and justice, and that is what this lawsuit sets out to do,” California Energy Commission Chair David Hochschild said in a statement. “The state’s goal to advance a 100% clean energy future depends on programs like this that make solar and storage affordable for all.”

The EPA is terminating nearly $250 million in funds awarded to California, including $200 million to build community solar systems, primarily for lower- and middle-income families, and $9 million for workforce training.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/Sd5zkBpjElCjYc0OBkXEjiIm7ZfqDj1RA2oLgDR_LFs/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMTUwMTg0NzUzLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-10-17 13:11:43.216295

Many power plants served by large mines on public lands in the West are nearing retirement.","BILLINGS, Mont. — Federal officials rejected a mining company's bid for more than 6 million tons of coal beneath a national forest in Utah, marking the third proposed coal sale from public lands in the West to fall through this month, the Interior Department disclosed Thursday.

The failed sales mark a setback in President Donald Trump's push to revive a coal mining industry that's been in decline for almost two decades.

The Interior Department rejected the sole bid it received for two tracts of federal coal reserves on the Manti-La Sal National Forest near central Utah's Skyline Mine because it did not meet the requirements of the Mineral Leasing Act, agency spokesperson Alyse Sharpe said.

The leasing act requires companies to pay fair market value for coal mined on public lands. Sharpe declined to say how much was bid.

The coal tracts were requested by a subsidiary of Utah mining company Wolverine Fuels LLC, which operates the Skyline Mine and other coal mines in central Utah.

Could mining boom days return to small Utah towns?

Officials had offered a lease on one tract, with 1.3 million tons of coal, during an Oct. 1 competitive sale. The other tract, with 5 million tons of coal, was a modification to an existing lease. The rejected bid covered both tracts, Sharpe said.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said two weeks ago that the government will open 13 million acres of federal lands for coal mining. But it's unclear who would want that fuel as utilities turn to cheaper natural gas and renewables such as wind and solar to generate electricity.

Emissions from burning coal are a leading driver of climate change that's raising sea levels and making weather more extreme.

On Oct. 6, a coal sale from public lands in Montana that would have been the largest by the government in more than a decade drew a single bid of $186,000, or about one-tenth of a penny per ton of coal, and was later rejected. That lease held 167 million tons of coal in southeastern Montana near the Navajo Transition Energy Co.'s Spring Creek mine.

Two days later the Interior Department postponed an even bigger sale — 440 million tons next to the Navajo Nation-owned company's Antelope Mine in Wyoming.

Sharpe repeated the Republican Trump administration's assertion that the policies of former Presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama were to blame for the failed sales, saying the Democrats tried ""to dismantle domestic production and shake investor confidence in the industry.""

Both Democrats attempted to curb sales of coal from public lands, only to have those policies reversed by Trump.

Three other coal lease sales from public lands under Trump were successful. The largest, in Alabama, involved 54 million tons of coal used in steelmaking that sold last month for $46 million, or about 87 cents per ton. Two recent sales in North Dakota of leases containing a combined 30 million tons of coal brought in $186,000 total, or less than a penny per ton.

""As demand for reliable, dispatchable power grows, coal remains a critical component of ensuring affordable and dependable energy for the American people,"" Sharpe said in a statement.

But industry analysts and economists say the biggest driver of coal's retreat has been market forces that make other fuels more economical. Many power plants served by large mines on public lands in the West are nearing retirement.

Environmentalists have fought for years against the expansion of Utah's Skyline Mine. Emma Yip with the Center for Biological Diversity described the bid rejection as ""yet another face-plant for the Trump administration"" as it tries to prop up a dying industry.

To the Editor:

During my 35-year career in environmental advocacy, I’ve opposed the privatization of natural resources numerous times. Clean air, land, and water are essential natural resources that must be managed in trust for everyone, and I have always believed strongly in public management.

When it comes to the ballot question regarding whether or not Hopewell Borough should sell its water system to New Jersey American Water, however, I will be voting yes.

I’m grateful to live in a town where residents—and our elected officials—take such decisions seriously. The large crowd that turned out to hear a presentation from opponents of the sale is evidence that participatory democracy is alive and well in Hopewell. I appreciate the diligence, commitment, and sincerity of the opponents.

I am also sympathetic to some of the arguments against the sale. The idea of local control of resources resonates with me.

But there is nothing more essential to the health of our families than the delivery of clean, safe, and healthy water. Let’s be honest with ourselves. Our beloved town is simply not up to this job. We can appreciate the staff who manage our water system. But the system is suffering from decades of deferred maintenance, and we’ve been hit with several violations from the NJ Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP).

In May, Hopewell residents received a mailing informing us that for 274 days in 2024, managers of our system failed to adequately treat our water with an additive that is used to prevent lead and other metals from leaching into our drinking water.

Change is scary. But so is lead and the forever chemical PFAS that persist in our water system.

New Jersey American Water (NJAW) is already delivering water to Hopewell to supplement our municipal well and that water meets the state of New Jersey’s standards for PFAS compounds. Moreover, the company is committed to meeting the US Environmental Protection Agency’s more stringent standards set under the Biden Administration, despite action by the Trump Administration to postpone the deadline for water systems to meet this stricter standard. According to NJAW “The recently announced plan by the EPA to extend the timeline for compliance would not impact New Jersey American Water’s PFAS compliance or capital plan as the company is committed to complying with the standards in a timely manner.”

Regarding removal of lead from Hopewell’s water system, assuming that the town votes in favor of the referendum, NJAW “intends to complete all replacements within 18-24 months (dependent on resident cooperation), ahead of the NJDEP 2031 deadline.”

Some have suggested that if Hopewell’s water infrastructure is sold to NJAW we would be left to the mercy of the company without any protection for the public interest. This is false.

New Jersey is fortunate to have several public agencies, in addition to NJDEP, that work to protect public health and the public interest.

The New Jersey Water Supply Authority (NJWSA) is charged with preserving both the quantity and quality of the source water that is refined and delivered to the state’s residents by private and public water companies. NJWSA manages the Spruce Run and Round Valley reservoirs on the Raritan River as well as the D&R Canal, another important source of drinking water.

NJWSA works in partnership with NJAW and other private and public water providers, NJDEP, nonprofit organizations like The Watershed Institute, academic institutions, and others to protect watersheds and surface waters through planning and preservation programs.

A second public body, the NJ Board of Public Utilities (BPU), is charged with regulating utilities like NJAW to provide safe, reliable, and reasonably priced services to the public.

In addition, the New Jersey Ratepayer Advocate serves as a watchdog to protect consumers from unfair pricing practices. These agencies and programs are certainly not perfect, but they exist to protect the public interest.

Hopewell residents need to decide for themselves how to vote on the Hopewell water referendum. I’ve decided to vote yes, and I hope that you will join me. The status quo is not acceptable.

Sincerely,

Jim Waltman

The investments aim to span multiple projects under U.S. oversight, foster transatlantic cooperation that enhances energy security, and focus on creating a robust and resilient fuel ecosystem. Specific projects and investment amounts will be detailed in forthcoming definitive agreements.

The partnership strengthens all parties' abilities to supply the growing global demand for energy. This effort includes co-investment into, and co-location of, fuel fabrication facilities and could include repurposing surplus plutonium in a manner consistent with established U.S. safety and security requirements.

“Fissioning surplus plutonium is the best way to eliminate a legacy liability while creating an abundant near-term fuel source. It can accelerate the deployment of multiple gigawatts of advanced reactors and serve as a bridge fuel until uranium enrichment and recycling scale up,” said Jacob DeWitte, co-founder and CEO of Oklo.

“This strategic partnership proves that energy independence relies on advanced fuels and promotes an integrated closed-loop fuel cycle. newcleo and its partners are ready to add value to the transatlantic cooperation in providing clean, safe and secure energy. The agreement proves that the U.S. and Europe can lead in this sector,” said Stefano Buono, founder and CEO of newcleo.

By channeling large-scale transatlantic investments into the American advanced nuclear industry, the partnership exemplifies newcleo’s and Blykalla’s interest in the U.S. market and supports the domestic expansion of Oklo’s fuel and fast-reactor technologies. Partnerships like this show how allied collaboration can strengthen energy innovation, leadership, and dominance in the United States.

“This agreement to implement newcleo's advanced fuel expertise into Oklo's powerhouses and invest $2 billion into American infrastructure and advanced fuel solutions is yet another win for President Donald J. Trump's American Energy Dominance Agenda,” said Secretary of the Interior and Chairman of the National Energy Dominance Council Doug Burgum. “This administration is committed to enhancing energy security, creating more American jobs, and ensuring that the United States remains at the forefront of global energy production and innovation, and I'm honored to support today's announcement to advance these goals.”

The partnership aligns private capital with federal priorities to accelerate advanced nuclear deployment while bolstering U.S. energy security and transatlantic cooperation and strengthening the domestic fuel supply.

The image, reposted from X, shows an EV charging station missing its cords, with one commenter quipping, ""I didn't realize that EV wireless charging was a thing now.""

The original Reddit poster asked a question many have been wondering: ""What's the solution? Anti-cutting cable wrap? Cameras to passively capture after the theft?""

Below the post, drivers debated whether this kind of damage counts as vandalism or theft — and what can realistically be done about it.

""Is it vandalism, or theft?"" one user asked, suggesting that some thieves might be targeting cables for copper. ""There are ones on light poles, way above the ground that spool.""

Others countered that even switching to aluminum wiring isn't a fix. ""That... won't solve the problem,"" one commenter said. ""Thieves don't steal copper — they steal things that they think are copper. Even if they abandon it because it's aluminum, it's still cut.""

These incidents aren't isolated. While this post is from three years ago, similar reports continue to surface from Los Angeles to Atlanta, with stations temporarily disabled for weeks while parts are replaced. Beyond inconvenience, the trend highlights a larger barrier to electric vehicle adoption: reliability. When chargers are damaged or out of service, drivers lose trust in the public charging network, which is a critical piece of infrastructure needed to transition away from dirty energy.

Electric vehicles remain one of the cleanest transportation options available, even factoring in battery manufacturing and charging emissions. Mining for battery minerals carries an environmental cost, but it replaces the far greater toll of extracting billions of tons of coal, oil, and gas each year.

For those charging at home, pairing an EV with solar panels can cut both costs and emissions even further. Drivers who install solar panels can effectively power their cars with sunlight, and companies like EnergySage make it easy to compare local quotes and find reliable installers vetted by The Cool Down.

While no single fix exists yet, experts say that protecting public chargers and the trust they represent is vital to keeping EV progress on track toward a cleaner, more sustainable future.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/cut-charging-cablesimage-recqjJTSPDfBkHNYP-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 20:07:30.008715

In North Carolina, state regulators are trying to figure out how to meet this unprecedented demand while also protecting the average ratepayer. Earlier this week, the North Carolina Utilities Commission held a two-day 'large load technical conference' to talk about these issues.

This conversation has been edited lightly for clarity.

Let’s start by introducing the players here. Who or what is the North Carolina Utilities Commission? Who was at the meeting this week?

The utilities commission is a five-person regulatory agency. They regulate public utilities in North Carolina, the largest being Duke Energy, which provides energy to the vast majority of the state.

The meeting held this week was focused on how to best serve large load customers like data centers. Several different stakeholders presented their ideas to the commission, including Duke Energy, Dominion Energy, clean energy advocates, and representatives from the data center industry.

In this context, what is the term 'large load'?

A large load customer is a customer that requires a lot of energy. According to a congressional report, data centers across the U.S. in 2023 used about 176 terawatt hours of energy, or about 4.4% of the country’s total electricity consumption that year. Some projections show the energy consumption from data centers could double or triple by 2028.

And why is that? Data centers have been around for years already. Why are they going to need so much more energy now?

Because of the rise of AI. At the meeting this week, I heard over and over again that right now, we're at an inflection point. How we choose to respond to this situation is going to have ramifications on energy production, infrastructure, and on the climate for decades to come.

What else did you hear at this week’s meeting? What are some of your biggest takeaways?

It seems that right now in North Carolina, there are a lot more questions than answers. Some of the biggest questions are: How much more energy are we going to need? By when do we need it? How are we going to generate that energy, and who’s going to pay for it?

Something else that stood out to me is that there are a lot of different balancing acts going on. Political leaders and Duke Energy representatives say data centers want to come to North Carolina because we have such a business friendly climate. These are million, and in some cases, billion dollar investments that provide good paying jobs for local families.

But that economic opportunity has to be balanced with consumer protections. The utilities commission wants to make sure the average person isn’t paying for additional energy infrastructure that’s ultimately meant to support data centers.

This is often what we hear when utilities have to generate more electricity. They talk about raising rates on ratepayers. Did this meeting provide any clarification on whether ratepayers will be paying more?

I think it’s fair to assume that yes, ratepayers can expect to keep seeing higher prices. Duke Energy representatives emphasized that they have to make upgrades to existing resources to increase reliability, while at the same time adding new resources to generate more energy.

Company representatives also really stressed that over the long term, as more large load customers join the system, that should alleviate rates. But it’s my understanding that that downward pressure won’t happen until at least another 15 years.

Another important topic that was discussed is energy generation. How are we going to produce all this energy? Data centers want energy as quickly as possible, and fossil fuels like natural gas and coal can meet this large demand quickly. But we have to remember that there’s a backdrop here of reaching net zero carbon emissions in North Carolina by 2050. Under state law, Duke Energy has to be carbon free by then.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a8ea988/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1075+0+230/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F35%2F5c%2Ff7d0261440238241cca7e61e5356%2Fimg-6981.JPEG,N,,2025-10-17 12:13:37.691490

NIPSCO Hardship is a program that helps customers whose income is right above the federal poverty guidelines for LIHEAP, or the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program.

NIPSCO Hardship offers gas bill assistance to households with incomes between 151% and 250% of the federal poverty level.

SERV is designed to help active military members and veterans who require financial assistance for their past-due NIPSCO residential gas accounts.

SILVER is for customers 60 and older, and they must also have an active, past-due NIPSCO gas account to be eligible.

Officials noted that gas usage spikes between November and March, which can take up a large chunk of energy bills.

“It’s important for customers to be prepared for the winter heating season,” NIPSCO President and COO Vince Parisi said in a press release.

“We encourage customers to explore the energy assistance programs available, which are there to help our most vulnerable community members stay safe and warm throughout the season.”

APPLY ASAP

NIPSCO dedicated an entire website page to its relief programs, which residents can use to apply for assistance.

The service company said applicants should allow up to 30 business days for their applications to be processed.

If an applicant meets all the requirements, a one-time credit will be automatically applied to their gas account.

“Customers are encouraged to check their eligibility and apply for these programs as soon as possible,” NIPSCO advised.

“They are also urged to share this information with family, neighbors and friends who may qualify.”

NIPSCO has additional assistance programs like its flexible payment plans, which allow customers to use three, six and 12-month payment plans.

A Cameron Parish judge has ruled that state officials violated the Louisiana Constitution when they issued a permit for a liquified gas export terminal, which has halted construction on the facility.

The decision, reached Friday, found that the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy (formerly Energy and Natural Resources) failed to consider the environmental impacts on surrounding communities when it approved a permit for the Commonwealth LNG export facility.

The halted Commonwealth facility is one of six LNG export projects proposed, approved or operating along Cameron’s coast. Construction of the pipelines, storage tanks and shipping facilities that make up the facility would dig up or fill nearly 200 acres of wetlands and water bottoms, according to the project’s coastal use permit application.

Judge Penelope Richard cited the close vicinity of other export terminals as a factor in her decision, saying the state “failed to consider the secondary and cumulative impacts” of these facilities on climate change in the coastal zone.

“We hope this ruling shakes Louisiana to its senses,” said Anne Rolfes, director of Louisiana Bucket Brigade. “The coastal use permit needs to be revoked.”

Rolfes’s organization, the Sierra Club and the Turtle Island Restoration Network filed the suit in August 2024.

“This is an area of the Louisiana coastline that is being devastated by LNG facilities,” said Joanie Steinhaus, ocean program director for Turtle Island Restoration Network. “These agencies have long ignored the cumulative impact to air and water quality and the health of the local community members and the environment”

There was no immediate response to attempts Tuesday to reach Commonwealth LNG about the court ruling.

Another lawsuit in a U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit rejected the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s approval of the project, citing its pollution impact. The decision delayed construction for two months until a new permit reevaluated the full impact of air pollution harms.

The state permit for Commonwealth LNG will be suspended until the Office of Coastal Management considers climate change and environmental justice concerns in its evaluation, according to Judge Richard’s ruling. The state would need to consider these additional aspects and find that impacts on the community do not outweigh the benefits of constructing another LNG export facility along Cameron’s coast in order to reissue the permit, the judge wrote in her opinion.",https://thelensnola.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LNG_Terminal-Cameron_Parish-0006_2048px-thelensnola.png,N,,2025-10-17 12:16:43.687407

Solar is the cheapest form of power available for the country. The Government’s approach is to maximise solar on rooftops; families could save around £500 a year on their energy bills by installing solar panels.

The Government is also consulting on mandatory community benefits for communities hosting ground-mount solar, meaning families who live near a solar farm would directly benefit through funding that can be spent on local priorities, like new education schemes, new grassroots football pitches or better transport links. Developers for the Tillbridge project have committed to ensuring the local community benefits from the project.

Energy Minister Michael Shanks said:

Climate change is creating new challenges for Great Lakes coastal communities.

To tackle these hazards, the Niagara Peninsula Conservation Authority launched the Lake Ontario Coastal Resilience Pilot Project last summer.

Over the next four years, the project aims to engage communities in developing a coastal resilience plan.

The plan outlines strategies for improving environmental, social, political and economic conditions to safeguard communities along a waterfront.

In Ontario, coastal climate impacts are evident through increased water levels, erosion and flooding, threatening homes, businesses and essential infrastructure.

Recent climate events have caused billions of dollars in flooding damage to Lake Ontario communities, including torrential rains in 2024 and record-high 100-year water levels in 2019.

“When we talk about most coastal communities down here in Niagara, we’re talking about built environments, natural environments, diversity of agriculture and economy, and also the social connection to the lake itself and the environment,” said Leilani Lee-Yates, the chief administrative officer of the Niagara Peninsula Conservation Authority.

The authority is partnering with Conservation Halton and the Hamilton Conservation Authority on the project. They operate under Conservation Ontario, which represents the province’s 36 conservation authorities.

Conservation authorities are local, nonprofit organizations with jurisdiction over a particular watershed.

They help communities create coastal resilience plans through science-based research to support growth and shoreline protection into the future, Lee-Yates said.

They are also exploring other types of shoreline protection measures.

Nature-based solutions use natural resources to prevent further shoreline erosion, unlike gray infrastructure, which relies on materials like metal or concrete.

The Lake Ontario Coastal Resilience Pilot Project will determine the most optimal course of action, which may use a combination of both techniques.

The authority will also collaborate with the Global Centre for Climate Change and Transboundary Waters and the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Cities Initiative. These organizations approach coastal resiliency from complementary angles.

“Our side is we’re looking at what are the socio-demographic, economic, governance and policy challenges that these climate imperatives are going to present for governance and community and political action in these areas,” said co-principal investigator Carolyn Johns of the Global Centre for Climate Change and Transboundary Waters .

The Lake Ontario Coastal Resilience Pilot Project is one of three pilot projects under Natural Resource Canada’s Climate-Resilient Coastal Communities Program. The multi-jurisdictional collaboration on this project spans northern Lake Superior, southern Lake Huron and western Lake Ontario.

“We’re really interested in populations that may not historically or traditionally be engaged in conservation authority work in watershed work, environmental work and specifically coastal resilience work,” Johns said.

Groups to be included are farmers, developers, anglers, Indigenous communities and youth.

Combined, the three projects have secured $4.9 million in funding. The Southern Lake Huron Littoral Cell Adaptation Plan is the furthest along, with two of its five years completed.

“Part of our project is teasing out what are all the current policies and laws that affect coastal resilience,” Johns said.

Johns and her team are identifying which policies could help local communities become more resilient. They are also examining which policies require innovation and adaptation.

“For instance, they might be designed to regulate flood zones, and those flood zones may have been based on some historical information and not really based on the current climate context,” Johns said.

The Niagara Peninsula Conservation Authority has connected with other diverse partners on the project to achieve these goals. One is the Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation, which “is so happy to join our partners in stewardship to restore, preserve and protect our coastal areas within our treaty territory,” Chief Claire Sault said in an email.

“I’m grateful that we have many valued allies who value this important work and initiative,” Sault said.

The name “Mississaugas” comes from the Anishinaabemowin word, “Missisakis,” which means “many river mouths.” The Mississaugas trace their name to the Trent, Moira, Shannon, Napanee, Kingston and Gananoque rivers.

Part of their vision is to safeguard the environment for future generations, a goal shared by the Lake Ontario Coastal Resilience Pilot Project.

By evaluating the current factors that contribute to coastal resilience in lakes Ontario, Huron and Superior, the Climate-Resilient Coastal Communities Program seeks to share best practices across all Ontario coastal communities.

“It’s very important because the Great Lakes are facing climate change and the communities that are going to grapple with that and need to adapt the most are the coastal communities,” Johns said. “The scale of this is really important because it’s really where the impacts are felt.”",https://greatlakesecho.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/COASTAL-RESILIENCE-AUTHORITIES-1170x780.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 13:12:30.015110

Continuing long-standing support for Bruce Power and its operations and projects, delegates to the Building Trades’ 68th Annual Convention in Windsor passed a resolution re-affirming their commitment to collaborating to further the company’s Life-Extension Program and MCR project, as well as new opportunities with the Bruce C Project, which could see the development of a new nuclear build on the Bruce Power site.

“The Ontario government’s Integrated Energy Plan – Energy for Generations – recognizes Bruce Power’s critical role in securing the future of the province’s clean energy supply, as well as the possibility of new nuclear through its Bruce C project,” said Marc Arsenault, Business Manager and Secretary-Treasurer of the Provincial Building and Construction Trades Council of Ontario. “Thanks to the hard work and dedication of Building Trades workers at Bruce Power, refurbishments are advancing safely, with quality, and on schedule, and the Bruce C project would create and sustain thousands of direct and indirect jobs during construction and operation.”

During the design and construction phase of Bruce C, it is estimated that more than 20,000 jobs would be created or supported nationally each year. Across the entire project lifespan, an estimated 12,000 full-time equivalent jobs would be created or supported annually in Canada.

The Building Trades Council resolution also called on the government to bolster its plans through policy certainty by “unlocking investment through Investment Tax Credits (ITCs) and other innovative financing models, Indigenous participation, and supply chain and workforce collaboration.”

As part of its resolution, the Building Trades highlighted the large economic footprint that Bruce Power projects have, including creating an estimated 22,000 jobs directly and indirectly from operations, and an additional 5,000 jobs annually throughout the investment program. The Building Trades are proactively collaborating with Bruce Power, site contractors, and the local community to help diversify the construction workforce needed to supply these projects, to include more Indigenous employees, women, returning veterans and reservists, and underemployed youth.

,EVs,2025-10-17 14:57:50+00:00,InsideEVs,'That Goal Has Been Achieved': Norway's Shift To EVs Is Nearly Complete - InsideEVs,Andrei Nedelea,,,,,https://insideevs.com/news/776141/norway-phase-out-ev-incentives/,"Norway's finance minister argues the country's transition to electric propulsion is pretty much complete and the incentive isn't needed anymore.
New EVs bought in the Nordic nation are exempt from import duties, paying road tax, registration tax and value-added tax (VAT).
If you buy a new EV in Norway and it exceeds 500,000 crowns ($49,600), you will pay full VAT for anything above that value.
So if a vehicle costs 600,000 crowns ($$59,500), then you have to pay 25% tax on the 100,000 crowns ($9,920) over the limit, so an additional 25,000 crowns ($2,480).
According to Reuters, Norway wants to proceed toward eliminating incentives because the country has already achieved its EV goal.","Nearly all new cars in Norway are electric now, so a plan to phase out subsidies is underway. There's now a proposal to phase out a tax exemption for EVs by 2027.

The plan is to lower the threshold for eligibility in 2026 before completely removing this benefit the following year.

Norway's finance minister argues the country's transition to electric propulsion is pretty much complete and the incentive isn't needed anymore.

The end of the $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles in the U.S. was definitely premature since the market is not even close to reaching a turning point in the shift to EVs. It was a useful incentive that made a difference. But in Norway, the EV shift has happened almost completely, so the subsidy phaseout will happen because government officials say the country no longer needs it.

Most new cars bought in Norway have been electric for a few years, and that won’t change once the government no longer actively incentivizes people to go electric. New EVs bought in the Nordic nation are exempt from import duties, paying road tax, registration tax and value-added tax (VAT). The latter alone is 25% so it makes for significant savings for the buyer.

This is all money that the Norwegian government could have collected, but instead opted not to in order to help accelerate EV adoption. And accelerate it did, with EV sales outpacing combustion cars for a few years now. The proportion of new cars that are electric grows from month to month and in September it reached 98.3%. These are pure electric vehicles, so they do not include plug-in hybrids.

If you buy a new EV in Norway and it exceeds 500,000 crowns ($49,600), you will pay full VAT for anything above that value. So if a vehicle costs 600,000 crowns ($$59,500), then you have to pay 25% tax on the 100,000 crowns ($9,920) over the limit, so an additional 25,000 crowns ($2,480).

For an electric vehicle costing 500,000 crowns, Norwegian buyers save 125,000 crowns ($12,400) in tax, which makes it one of the best EV incentives available anywhere in the world. This is before factoring in any of the exemptions, which sweeten the deal further.

Now there is a proposal to lower the threshold for the all-important VAT exemption as of next year, where only vehicles costing less than 300,000 crowns ($29,800) would be fully exempt. EV buyers would pay full VAT for anything over. This means most vehicles among the top 10 best-selling models would no longer qualify, so the price the buyer would end up paying would be significantly higher than today.

According to Reuters, Norway wants to proceed toward eliminating incentives because the country has already achieved its EV goal. The country’s finance minister, Jens Stoltenberg, said ""We have had a goal that all new passenger cars should be electric by 2025, and... we can say that the goal has been achieved. Therefore, the time is ripe to phase out the benefits.""

The plan is to completely eliminate the VAT exemption by 2027, but the news has been met with resistance from pro-EV groups in Norway, like the Norwegian EV Association. It points to the fact that even though EVs dominate new car sales in the country, 70% of all cars on the road still burn fuel—so it’s hard to say that the shift to EVs has been completed. It's going to take a long time to replace all of them, if that can even be done.

All these benefits have definitely helped Norway go electric more quickly than without them. The same is true in the U.S., where the federal tax credit resulted in more EV purchases. Now that it’s been phased out, the rate of EV adoption in the U.S. will slow down, although it did see a final spike in September, the last month when people could still claim $7,500 on a new EV or up to $4,000 if they were buying used.

Meanwhile, Germany has announced plans to reintroduce a new EV subsidy program in the form of a purchase incentive of up to €4,000 ($4,675) starting in 2026. The only caveat is that buyers here will be eligible depending on their income.

Germany’s EV incentive is relatively small by European standards, as many countries will subsidize up to €10,000, although usually not more than half of the vehicle’s value and some places like Romania require you to scrap an old car to qualify for the incentive.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/P3oZO4/s1/hyundai-ioniq-5-powers-reindeer-farm-in-northern-norway.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 13:11:09.359415

The State of Michigan and 23 other grant recipients also filed suit in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims to recover damages (PDF) for the EPA’s unlawful breach of the grant agreements that were executed under this program.

Congress created the Solar for All program in 2022 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, directing the EPA to make competitive grants to states and other entities to deploy solar projects in low-income and disadvantaged areas. The EPA selected recipients and awarded all of the program funds to plaintiff states and other grant recipients by August 2024. Michigan and the other plaintiffs moved forward with planning projects and working with stakeholders to develop their solar programs, but the EPA abruptly and unlawfully terminated the program two months ago and clawed back the vast majority of the money already awarded. That has left Michigan and the other plaintiffs without access to the funds to proceed with their solar programs, after the states spent significant time planning and launching programs and committing state funds.

In 2024, Michigan’s Solar for All program was awarded approximately $156 million by the EPA. The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy selected and announced 13 pilot projects across the state to begin implementing Solar for All-funded initiatives, with a second round of grantees planned for 2025. The loss of $156 million in federal funding has halted these projects and denied disadvantaged communities across Michigan the benefits the program was designed to deliver.

“The Trump Administration’s decision to illegally rescind congressionally approved grants – funds that were already being put to work in our communities – is unlawful and deeply harmful to residents across Michigan and the country,” Nessel said. “We’ve seen this playbook from the White House before. The administration has tried to pull the same stunt by canceling congressionally mandated programs, and we stopped them then. We plan to do the same now to ensure the Trump Administration cannot unlawfully strip away these important investments that lower energy costs and make clean energy more accessible to Michigan families.”

“I applaud Attorney General Nessel for standing up for Michigan families and challenging the EPA’s decision to revoke funding for the MI Solar for All program. This program is a critical investment in our state’s energy future — lowering costs for low-income households, creating good-paying local jobs, and helping us achieve greater energy independence,” said Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy Director Phil Roos. “It would expand access to clean, affordable solar energy while supporting Michigan’s economy and American manufacturing. We remain committed to fighting for this program and the thousands of Michiganders it would benefit.”

Attorney General Nessel and a multistate coalition alleged in the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, among other things, that the EPA violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the U.S. Constitution’s Separation of Powers Doctrine in unlawfully canceling the program.

Attorney General Nessel was joined by the attorneys general of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaiʻi, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and the District of Columbia in filing this complaint. Also joining the complaint are the governors of Kentucky and Pennsylvania, as well as the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation.

Separately, Attorney General Nessel joined a related lawsuit that was filed in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. In that complaint, the states and other entities argue the EPA breached the clear terms of the agreements with states and other grantees and violated the duty of good faith and fair dealing in canceling their Solar for All grants. The plaintiff states seek money damages, interest, and fees.

Last week, a judge from Louisiana's 38th Judicial District Court effectively halted construction of Commonwealth LNG by ordering state regulators to analyze the facility's climate change and environmental justice-related impacts, in conjunction with the broader LNG buildout in southwest Louisiana's Cameron Parish.

Three of the nation's eight existing LNG export terminals are located in Cameron Parish, and several more are proposed or under construction there.

Louisiana's attorney general vowed to appeal the ruling, which vacated the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy's coastal use permit for the facility.

""This is the first time any court has vacated a permit for an LNG facility based on the government's refusal to consider climate change impacts,"" said Clay Garside, an attorney representing the Sierra Club and other environmental groups.

Earlier this year, Trump reversed a Biden-era pause on exports of liquefied natural gas, or LNG, as part of his goal to boost natural gas exports and promote ""energy dominance.""

Last year, the Biden administration's Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm's had warned that ""unfettered exports"" of liquefied natural gas would increase planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions — a statement reflecting the findings of a Department of Energy report released in December.

Trump-appointed Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a fossil fuel executive, has moved to fast-track the buildout of LNG facilities, including Commonwealth LNG, which received an export authorization within weeks of Trump's inauguration.

""Cameron Parish is ground zero for the relentless expansion of the gas export industry,"" said Anne Rolfes, founder of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, an environmental group involved in the litigation. ""We're going to stop it and this is an important step in that process.""

Lyle Hanna, a Commonwealth LNG spokesperson, said that ""we are disappointed with the District Court's decision, and we are exploring all available legal options.""

A spokesperson for the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy declined to comment, citing the potential of pending litigation. Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said that the state planned to appeal.

""Sadly even state court judges are not immune from climate activism,"" Murrill said.

Last year, a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., had ordered the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to reassess Commonwealth LNG's air pollution, including its greenhouse gas emissions. In June, the commission gave the project a greenlight on the grounds that its construction was in the public interest.

In regulatory filings, the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy said that ""climate change is currently beyond the scope"" of the state's regulatory review.

But District Judge Penelope Richard rejected this position, saying state environmental regulators have a duty to consider how the LNG facility, along with others clustered nearby, would impact extreme weather events, storm severity and sea-level rise in a state where a football field-worth of land disappears every 100 minutes.

Richard also ordered state regulators to analyze the facility's impacts on local communities, especially those living in poverty or relying on fishing for their livelihoods — which she noted was the ""defining characteristic"" of the parish. While the facility could destroy marshes, harm water quality and displace residents, the judge wrote, ""none of it was considered in terms of impacts on environmental justice communities.""

Commercial fisherman Eddie LeJuine, a lifelong Cameron Parish resident, applauded the ruling. He said the buildout of LNG infrastructure, including dredging for shipping channels, has significantly harmed the fishing industry.

""The fishermen are barely hanging on with a thread,"" LeJuine said. ""These plants are killing the estuary and killing our livelihoods. We're getting extinct.""

In August, a dredging channel being developed by LNG firm Venture Global leaked into a nearby estuary. Local fishermen like LeJuine say the onslaught of saltwater and sediment will kill off large amounts of oyster, crab and fish.

Venture Global, which is in the process of constructing a second LNG export terminal in the parish, said it is ""committed to conservation"" and is working with state regulators and the community to respond to the incident.",https://img.manufacturing.net/mindful/im/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/10/lng.rcSNNyT8cu.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&crop=focalpoint&fit=max&fp-x=0.56&fp-y=0.25&q=70&w=1200,N,,2025-10-17 15:03:52.606706

Electric vehicles made up 11% of total new car purchases during those months, topping the earlier peak of 8.7%. Buyers flooded showrooms before federal tax incentives disappeared at the end of September.

The sales boom showed that a strong appetite exists for electric transportation among American drivers. Sticker prices have come down enough that 11 different electric models now sell for less than what the typical new car costs. The Chevrolet Equinox carries a starting price near $35,000, while Chevy's redesigned Bolt sells for $29,000.

Switching to electric vehicles improves air quality nationwide. Fewer gasoline-burning engines on roads means less pollution is released into the air people breathe.

Emily Almaer lives in Boulder, Colorado, with her three children and leases a Volkswagen ID.4 for $250 each month. Three friends of hers also purchased electric vehicles recently.

""You look at some of these [monthly payments],"" her husband, Dion Almaer, said, per Bloomberg, ""and it's like, 'Wait, this is like one family meal out.'""

Tesla has maintained its position as market leader but faces competition. Its share of the market has shrunk from 80% four years ago to 41% now as rival automakers roll out budget-friendly choices. General Motors took 15% of third-quarter sales, climbing from 10% during the same stretch last year.

What comes next may prove more difficult without government subsidies. Forecasters expect a temporary sales slowdown as shoppers adapt to paying full price. But according to BloombergNEF, about 50% of people who bought electric vehicles during the first half of the year did so without receiving government assistance. This move demonstrates that demand exists even outside of incentive programs.

The stock has been on quite the ride lately, with headlines buzzing about potential changes that could shift the whole industry landscape. In just the past week, GM’s share price climbed 2.5%, even after dipping a bit over the last 30 days. Zooming out, the picture gets even more interesting: up 11.6% since the start of the year, 17.4% over the past twelve months, and a massive 77% in the last three years. Clearly, something is in motion.

So, what is driving this? Two developments stand out. First, the White House is preparing to ease tariffs for automakers, which could mean lower costs and higher margins for GM in the future. Second, GM’s bet on producing rare-earth magnets in the U.S. is paying off, putting the company in a strong position with supply chain advantages that few rivals can match. Although not every plan went smoothly, with GM recently scrapping a last-minute strategy around electric vehicle tax credits, the overall sentiment around risk appears to be changing to the company’s benefit.

When we turn to valuation, GM scores an impressive 5 out of 6 on our value checklist, signaling that the stock may still be flying under the radar for many investors. But numbers alone only tell part of the story. Next, we will look at how each valuation approach weighs in, and why there might be an even better way to assess the company’s true worth than you might expect.

Approach 1: General Motors Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is designed to estimate a company’s intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and discounting them back to present-day dollars. For General Motors, analysts start by looking at its current Free Cash Flow, which over the last twelve months stands at $13.05 billion. This figure sets the benchmark for future growth scenarios.

Forecasts suggest that by 2029, General Motors’ annual Free Cash Flow will be about $8.6 billion. Analyst estimates for the next five years show some variance, with cash flow projections between $7 billion and $8.6 billion per year. Beyond this period, Simply Wall St continues the projection through to 2035, resulting in estimates of over $10 billion in annual Free Cash Flow within the next decade.

When all these cash flows are discounted and summed, the DCF model arrives at a fair value of $89.84 per share for GM. This figure is 36.2% higher than the company’s current share price. This points to meaningful potential upside and suggests the stock is undervalued at present.

Result: UNDERVALUED

Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests General Motors is undervalued by 36.2%. Track this in your or , or discover more .

Approach 2: General Motors Price vs Earnings

For profitable companies like General Motors, the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio is a widely recognized measure for valuation because it shows how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings generated. As a company’s future growth opportunities expand or its perceived risks decline, its “normal” or “fair” PE ratio tends to rise. This reflects improved expectations for returns and stability. On the other hand, higher risks or slower growth typically lead to lower PE ratios being considered fair.

Currently, GM trades at 8.4x earnings. This is notably below both the average PE ratio for its industry, which is 19.2x, and the average of its direct peers at 18.5x. At first glance, this sizable discount could suggest undervaluation. However, headline comparisons do not always tell the full story.

This is where Simply Wall St’s “Fair Ratio” comes into play. The Fair Ratio for GM is calculated at 15.1x, which takes into account the company’s specific factors, such as growth outlook, profit margins, market cap, and unique risks, alongside its role in the auto industry. Unlike a simple peer or industry comparison, the Fair Ratio aims to tailor the benchmark to what is really relevant for GM, providing a more precise yardstick for value.

Comparing GM’s current multiple of 8.4x to its Fair Ratio of 15.1x, the company still trades at a significant discount. This means that, based on these forward-looking and company-specific factors, GM appears undervalued on a PE basis.

Result: UNDERVALUED

PE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? .

Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your General Motors Narrative

Earlier, we mentioned there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let’s introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is simply the story you believe about a company, your perspective on where it’s headed and why, backed up by your own estimates for future revenue, profitability, and fair value. Narratives connect the dots between what’s happening on the ground, your financial forecasts, and what you think GM should be worth, forming a clear and actionable investment thesis.

On Simply Wall St’s Community page, millions of investors use Narratives to share their views and track how their expectations compare to the current share price. Narratives help you decide when to buy or sell by highlighting the gap between fair value and market price, so you always know whether the opportunity matches your story. Even better, Narratives update in real time as news or earnings come out, so your thesis stays relevant.

For example, one investor’s Narrative for General Motors might predict robust electric vehicle growth and resilient margins, giving a bullish fair value of $80 per share. Another focused on risks from tariffs and EV adoption could justify a lower target of $38. Narratives let you define, refine, and act on your own investment rationale with confidence.

NEOM Green Hydrogen Project in Saudi Arabia has reached an 80% construction completion mark

The NEOM Green Hydrogen Project exemplifies the current evolution of the global energy sector. Over the past decade, the global community has seen a significant increase in the renewable energy sector as the world leaves the coal and gas sectors in the rear-view mirror.

The NEOM Green Hydrogen Project is reaching the 80% completion mark across its vast array of facilities, including its wind garden, solar farm, and transmission grid. The project noted the successful delivery and installation of crucial equipment, including wind turbines, hydrogen storage vessels, electrolyzers, a cold box, and pipe racks.

NEOM Green Hydrogen Company boasts that the project is the world’s largest’ green hydrogen-based ammonia production facility run on renewable energy. The project is an equal production joint venture of ACWA Power, Air Products, and NEOM. Air Products, which is a US-based company, noted the progress being made.

“The 4 GW solar and wind power generation sites are scheduled for completion by mid-2026, with first ammonia product availability expected in 2027.” – Air Products spokesperson

NEOM Green Hydrogen Company has initiated a major recruitment campaign for the facility

As NEOM nears completion, the project will need to recruit more employees. In that regard, several job openings have been posted by the project management. The facility has cost approximately $8.4 billion to date and will continue to expand its operational readiness as it nears completion.

In 2016, Saudi Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman announced Saudi Vision 2030, which calls for a more diversified economy, society, and culture in the Kingdom. The CEO of the NEOM Green Hydrogen Company has noted that the project aligns perfectly with the Saudi Vision 2030 policy.

“By bringing together top talent from Saudi Arabia and around the world, we are building a skilled team to deliver the world’s largest green hydrogen plant and kick off operations, setting the stage for a cleaner and more sustainable energy future.” – Wesam Alghamdi, CEO of NEOM Green Hydrogen Company

The green hydrogen and ammonia projects emerging from several nations have catapulted the progress of the sector into the stratosphere, with huge solar-to-hydrogen and ammonia projects being planned in countries like Namibia.

Air Products will be the exclusive 30-year offtaker for the project, and will export the green hydrogen in the form of green ammonia to the international heavy industry and transportation sectors.

The history-heavy piece edition was by S. S. Wilson, then a lecturer in engineering at Oxford University.
With the aid of a bicycle, however, the man’s energy consumption for a given distance is reduced to about a fifth.

Using heat maps and the addition of a cyclist in a cycle covered with an aerodynamic fairing, Scientific American shows that propelling such a “velomobile” makes cycling even more energy efficient.","Fifty two years after Scientific American first declared a human propelling a bicycle to coasting speed more efficient than salmon, seagulls, or jet planes, the august magazine has revisited an iconic 1973 graph and the results hold firm: the cycle remains the planet’s most energy-efficient mode of transport.

The graph, much reproduced by cycle advocates and engineers down the years, was included in an 11-page article on bicycle technology that appeared in the March 1973 edition of Scientific American. The history-heavy piece edition was by S. S. Wilson, then a lecturer in engineering at Oxford University.

He wrote that the purpose of a bicycle was to “make it easier for an individual to move about, and this the bicycle achieves in a way that quite outdoes natural evolution.”

Wilson argued: “When one compares the energy consumed in moving a certain distance as a function of body weight for a variety of animals and machines, one finds that an unaided walking man does fairly well but he is not as efficient as a horse, a salmon or a jet transport. With the aid of a bicycle, however, the man’s energy consumption for a given distance is reduced to about a fifth. Therefore, apart from increasing his unaided speed by a factor of three or four, the cyclist improves his efficiency rating to No. 1 among moving creatures and machines.”

This extract, and the graph that accompanied it, went on to inspire many, including Steve Jobs of Apple, who used it in a 1980 presentation to explain the efficiency of the personal computer. Quoting the Scientific American article, he said: “What a computer is to me is it’s the most remarkable tool that we’ve ever come up with, and it’s the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds.”

Now Scientific American has updated and re-released what it calls the “classic graphic” that shows that a human on a bicycle—able to coast, or freewheel, without pedaling—remains the world’s most energy effecient traveler.

Using heat maps and the addition of a cyclist in a cycle covered with an aerodynamic fairing, Scientific American shows that propelling such a “velomobile” makes cycling even more energy efficient. (The world speed record for a human inside such a velomobile was set in 2016 by Canadian rider Todd Reichert: he peaked, on pedal power alone, at just a smidgen below 90 miles per hour.)

Tyson Hedrick, a comparative physiologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill told today’s Scientific American that a cycle “turns a human into [an] hyperefficient terrestrial locomotor.”

ForbesBicycling Booms During Lockdown—But There's A Warning From History

Back in 1973, at the height of the 1970s bike boom, Wilson wrote of the cycle’s human-sized perfection: “It is because every part of the design must be related to the human frame that the entire bicycle must always be on a human scale. The lightness of construction, achieved mainly through the development of the wire-spoke wheel and the tubular frame, was dictated not only by the fact that the machine has to be pedaled uphill but also by the desirability of making it easy to lift. Since the bicycle makes little demand on material or energy resources, contributes little to pollution, makes a positive contribution to health and causes little death or injury, it can be regarded as the most benevolent of machines.”

He continued: “For those of us in the overdeveloped world the bicycle offers a real alternative to the automobile.”

The possible inducements of more cycling are many, he stated, including “cycleways to reduce the danger to cyclists of automobile traffic, bicycle parking stations, facilities for the transportation of bicycles by rail and bus, and public bicycles for ‘park and pedal’ service. Already bicycling is often the best way to get around quickly in city centers.”

He concluded: “If one were to give a short prescription for dealing rationally with the world’s problems of development, transportation, health and the efficient use of resources, one could do worse than the simple formula: Cycle and recycle.”",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68f2338d99e4ecf085367557/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-10-17 12:16:16.435065

This power is intended for the next generation of artificial intelligence data centres using Energy Transfer’s natural gas network to provide a stable energy supply for Oracle’s growing infrastructure needs.

The VoltaGrid power platform is a modular system with high-transient-response designed to balance speed, reliability and environmental performance.

Developed in collaboration with INNIO Jenbacher and ABB, the platform is engineered to meet the demanding power profiles of AI operations while aiming to reduce the dependency on battery storage.

“This is more than a power deal; it’s a collaboration with Oracle to engineer scalable solutions that dampen swings in AI power demand,” explains Nathan Ough, CEO of VoltaGrid.

He adds: “Together, we’re delivering grid-grade performance with ultra-fast response, zero reliance on battery storage and near-zero criteria air emissions.”

This partnership reflects the increasing energy requirements of AI computing and the data centres that support it. As large-scale AI models continue to expand, maintaining stable and clean power becomes a critical operational challenge for cloud providers.

Addressing unstable power consumption in AI workloads

AI applications place pressure on data centre energy systems.

The power usage fluctuates depending on model size and computational intensity, which can lead to inconsistent loads that affect efficiency and grid performance. This variability is a core challenge for operators of large-scale AI infrastructure.

Mahesh Thiagarajan, Executive Vice President of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, says: “AI workloads are uniquely power-intensive and highly variable, often creating swings in demand. By collaborating with VoltaGrid, we’re engineering innovations that dampen these swings, making AI’s power usage more stable, predictable and grid-friendly.”

VoltaGrid’s modular infrastructure enables Oracle to stabilise the energy supply across its expanding AI footprint.

Mahesh adds: “VoltaGrid’s platform joins OCI’s broad energy portfolio to bolster our leading-edge AI infrastructure with dependable power that can be effortlessly scaled.” The system integrates with OCI’s energy strategy to ensure continuous on-demand power delivery while maintaining compliance with emissions standards.

Utilising natural gas for AI infrastructure resilience

Energy Transfer, a major US energy infrastructure provider, has a central role in the partnership. Its pipeline and storage network delivers a firm natural gas supply to VoltaGrid’s new facilities, providing a dependable source of fuel for sustained operations.

This access to a stable gas supply shows the commercial value of Energy Transfer’s infrastructure in supporting enterprise-scale energy requirements.

The approach also reflects the growing importance of hybrid energy solutions that balance renewable integration with reliable gas-based supply for consistent uptime.

The collaboration allows Oracle to reinforce the resilience of its AI infrastructure without relying exclusively on grid resources.

In doing so, it strengthens data centre reliability across regions with increasing electricity demand caused by AI and high-performance computing growth.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/5e47454f2bbd9c8b19e65a3fd93cdd04:b866909d3852702f201d2a29df095543/nathan-ough-ceo-of-voltagrid.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 14:11:38.858772

Greenflash Infrastructure, L.P. announced the acquisition of the Rock Rose project, a battery energy storage facility with a capacity of 200 megawatts (MW) and 400 megawatt-hours (MWh), located in Fort Bend County, Texas. This standalone project, currently in pre-Notice-to-Proceed (pre-NTP) phase, was previously owned by Advanced Power. The transaction represents a significant asset transfer within the Texas electricity network operated by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT).

Immediate integration into Greenflash’s ERCOT strategy

The Rock Rose project joins Greenflash’s portfolio dedicated to ERCOT, where the company plans to deploy up to 5 gigawatts (GW) of capacity. According to the firm, the asset was selected for its location, transmission access, and ability to support grid stability. The site is fully permitted and interconnection-ready, with commercial operations targeted for mid-2027 following a Notice to Proceed expected in 2026.

A targeted asset transfer in a high-pressure market

Advanced Power, the original project owner, stated that the sale enables Rock Rose to benefit from accelerated execution in a context of rising energy reliability needs. The project will now be developed by Greenflash, which is focused on large-scale standalone deployments. The Chief Executive Officer of Advanced Power noted the necessity for the Texas market to access operational solutions capable of meeting fluctuating demand.

Rock Rose is designed as a two-hour discharge battery storage facility, built to provide targeted support during peak demand periods while contributing to grid balancing. Greenflash plans to implement the project in alignment with its other ongoing ERCOT developments.

A transaction aligned with portfolio repositioning

This deal illustrates an active trend of asset transfers within the U.S. energy storage sector. Advanced Power is continuing to streamline its portfolio towards complementary segments, including thermal and renewable infrastructure. By selling Rock Rose, it enables Greenflash to capitalise on a ready-to-execute project that is strategic within a large-scale growth programme.

Two years after Germany scrapped its incentives for electric vehicles, a move that triggered a sharp drop in demand as we widely reported, the country is preparing to bring them back. The new purchase program will take effect in January 2026.

Renewed Push For Affordability

The new scheme will be introduced at a pivotal time for the European car industry as it struggles with US-imposed import tariffs and new competition from China.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz revealed earlier this week that €3 billion ($3.5 billion) will be allocated for zero-emission vehicle purchase incentives through 2029, targeting low- and middle-income households.

Read: Germany’s EV Sales Crash 28% In First Full Year Without Subsidies

It’s understood that the program will offer incentives worth up to €4,000 ($4,600) on the purchase of a new EV that’s priced under €45,000 ($52,600). That is a big change from the previous scheme that had a higher price limit of €65,000 ($76,000).

Importantly, plug-in hybrid vehicles will not be included in the program, although used EVs will, for the first time, be eligible, too according to German media, as reported by Autonews.

Who Qualifies

While some finer details about the program are still being ironed out, an income cap of around €45,000 ($52,600) is expected. While speaking about the new incentives, Social Democratic Party secretary-general Tim Kluessendorf said that “everyone must be able to afford the [electric] transition.”

“What is important to me in designing the subsidy program is that it must benefit the German and European automotive industry in particular,” he added. “The Ministry of the Environment will ensure that this is the case. The future is electric, and we want it to be written in Germany.”

The remark suggests the incentives could be limited to vehicles produced by European manufacturers, though no official confirmation has been made. We’ll have to wait and see if this case, but the local car industry could do with all the help it can get at the moment.

A phasing out of subsidies in China and the end of pre-buying in the US to get ahead of tariffs mean that carmakers’ profits are expected to come under pressure, according to S&P Global Ratings analyst Vittoria Ferraris.

Car sales globally were up 5 per cent in the first half of the year to 37.4mn units, against a forecast of a slight decline, the rating agency said. Growth was strongest in China, where government incentives drove an 11 per cent increase in car buying.

US car sales for the first nine months were up 4 per cent to 12.2mn units, according to S&P Global. As well as trying to avoid tariffs, buyers of electric vehicles (EVs) in the US sought to make purchases before tax credits provided by the Biden government as part of the Inflation Reduction Act were phased out in September.

S&P Global now expects global light vehicle sales to reach about 90.1mn units this year, but for the market to then remain flat for the next two years.

“Europe looks increasingly difficult, especially in the mass market segment,” said UBS analyst Patrick Hummel, pointing to recent production cuts at both Stellantis (IT:STLAM) and Volkswagen (DE:VOW) as demand slows.

Porsche sputters

VW warned last month that its group operating margin would be much lower than anticipated this year – at 2-3 per cent, compared with prior guidance of 4-5 per cent. This is mainly down to a €3bn (£2.6bn) impairment on the carrying value of its 76 per cent stake in Porsche (DE:P911). A realignment strategy for the flagging sports car brand – which has suffered due to much lower sales at home and in China – will cost a further €2.1bn.

Meanwhile, Stellantis said last week that it expects third-quarter shipments to be up 13 per cent year on year, although this would still be a 10 per cent drop compared with the previous quarter, according to analysts at HSBC.

One difficulty for Europe’s carmakers particularly is the increased competition from Chinese manufacturers both in China and at home.

Chinese carmakers have increased their share of the domestic market from a little over 40 per cent to 70 per cent over the past five years, and although Beijing has taken measures to iron out uncompetitive practices, “we are definitely not in a position to say that the price war in China is over”, Hummel said.

He argued that some Chinese competitors are adding features to their vehicles for free, and with sales volumes under pressure “we expect further double-digit per cent declines for the German automakers in the third quarter”.

In western Europe, Chinese brands took a 6.7 per cent share of the market in the third quarter, up from 3.9 per cent a year earlier, according to Schmidt Automotive Research. By September, they had captured an 8 per cent share, surpassing South Korea’s carmakers.

“This can definitely grow further towards 10 per cent over the next year or two. The product is competitive,” Hummel said. Although the European Commission introduced tariffs of up to 45 per cent on Chinese-made EVs last year, Chinese carmakers are finding ways of avoiding these – either by importing from countries that are not subject to tariffs or by assembling more locally (sometimes with European partners), he added.

Another competitive pressure is the rush of new models scheduled to launch within the next couple of years.

Analysts at HSBC estimate that globally 900 new models are due to be brought to market by the end of 2027, with the peak of new arrivals landing next year.

“Rather than the typical refresh cycle, the current launch extravaganza is borne out of necessity to bring more affordable EVs to market,” said HSBC analyst Pushkar Tendolkar in a recent note.

The main problem with this is that given the competitive nature of the market, the typical boost carmakers get from launching new vehicles “could be muted in this cycle”, Tendolkar warned.

Hummel also pointed to the risks of increasing fragmentation in regional requirements, with the rolling back of CO₂ emissions regulations in the US, higher trade barriers between the US, Europe and China and issues around data privacy and protection that mean “it’s near impossible to have one global software stack” for cars, he said.

Over time, he expects that regulators in Europe may require Chinese carmakers to develop more of their vehicles locally, but this would be a difficult rule to enact now “because even the European car industry can’t do without Chinese-made batteries”.

Globally, carmakers trade at 9.5 times forecast earnings for 2026, with Chinese carmakers top of the tree at 13 times, according to UBS.

This is the first of its kind structure that doesn’t use traditional solar panels or traditional renewable energy systems, but it produces massive amounts of clean electricity. While being a prestigious commercial center, the luxury energy tower is located in one of the world’s most energy-intensive regions, where innovation meets necessity.

Bahrain World Trade Center pioneers integrated wind technology

The installation of wind turbines in sufficient numbers in a commercial building design is the first instance in the world where innovative engineering and architecture truly met with genius. Located in the central business district of Manama, this 240-meter twin tower development has three horizontal-axis wind turbines that are suspended between sail-inspired office structures that take advantage of the consistent Arabian Gulf breeze on shore.

Design Director Shaun Killa from W.S. Atkins developed the idea of using nautical sail expressions to harness the power of wind and create these beautiful architectural forms that will transcend time. The elliptical plan forms and sail-like structures act as aerofoils concentrating the onshore breezes between the towers while producing negative pressure behind the towers, in effect accelerating the onshore breeze velocity.

The vertical sculpting of the towers has aerodynamic values; they have a shape that is aerofoil and tapered upwards, with reducing Aerofoil sections. This construction, coupled with the growing wind speed at greater altitudes, is designed such that there is almost uniformity in the wind regimes of all three turbine levels, and this allows maximum energy generation and minimal fatigue of the blade during the wind skew situations.

Three turbines produce significant renewable energy production

All of the turbines are 29 meters in diameter with a nominal power of 225kW with stall-controlled technology, which limits power generation passively on high wind days. The turbines have a wind azimuth operating range of 60 degrees and automatically switch to the standstill mode when the wind is outside the optimal range.

Revolutionary design produces amazing annual energy yields

The integrated wind system generates between 1,100 and 1,300 MWh of energy per year, which accounts for between 11% and 15% of the office towers’ total consumption of electrical energy. This sizeable renewable energy contribution equates to substantial reductions in carbon emissions equivalent to 2,900 kg carbon from oil-burning power stations or 2,000 kg carbon from gas-burning.

The funneling effect between towers increases the wind speed at the locations of turbines by as much as 30%, with the upper and lower turbines set to generate 109% and 93%, respectively, compared to the middle turbine set to generate 100%. This fairly balanced energy yield shows all the sophisticated aerodynamic engineering that was used in the architectural design. The bridges that connect the towers span 31.7 meters in total and include bearings that have no maintenance services, thus permitting 0.5 meters of movement relative to each other.

Technical specifications:

Tower height: 240 meters (787 feet)

Turbine diameter: 29 meters each

Annual energy output: 1,100-1,300 MWh

Power per turbine: 225kW nominal

Design criticism reveals possible improvements in efficiency

The reversing of the tower can potentially enhance energy production by 14%; Professor Bert Blocken of Eindhoven University was told by measurements in the wind tunnel and the computer that there was a way to do it. His own research indicates that with wind turbines further back, it may be possible to achieve 31% higher annual energy generation.

The Bahrain World Trade Center is a breakthrough in the realm of sustainable architecture by proving the fact that the incorporation of renewable energy can even contribute to the increase in the aesthetic value instead of its reduction. This pioneering project has set a new standard of consensus in integrating wind energy systems in urban, high-rise developments, with the commercial viability and architectural excellence preserved in the difficult desert climate conditions.

Domestic energy security will create global potential.
When Belgium’s Princess Elisabeth energy island is complete, standing lonely but unbowed amid the storms of the North Sea, it will be a powerful symbol of renewables’ new role on the frontline as nations invest to build energy security.","For more than two centuries, energy has been the beating heart of economic growth.

Until recently, most of this energy has come from one simple mechanism – burning things. And as we’ve switched from wood to harder-to-access (but more energy-intense) coal, oil and gas, so our economy has come to rely on a sprawling network of pipelines and trade routes.

This has created some unexpected relationships. In 1997, for instance, just six years after the end of the Cold War, the Nord Stream 1 pipeline was completed, connecting Germany and Russia via the Baltic Sea. At the height of its operation in 2021, Germany was getting 55% of its natural gas from Russia, along with the majority of its coal and oil. At the same time, the wider EU bloc was also buying most of its oil and gas from Russia.1

Today, as deglobalisation continues and the geopolitical landscape shifts, many of these relationships are fraying. Germany and the EU have slashed their energy imports from Russia, aiming to end them entirely by 20272; meanwhile India has come under pressure from US President Donald Trump to do the same3.

The question for investors is, what will replace these routes? Are buyers simply finding alternative sellers, or is a deeper shift taking place?

At Lombard Odier, we believe the world’s energy system is undergoing a profound change. Driven by a desire to achieve domestic security, many governments are seeking not just to re-route their energy purchases, but to build their own home-grown supply. From China to Europe and India to the US, energy independence is increasingly being seen as the best form of defence against a fracturing and unstable geopolitical order.

Renewables – the first line of defence

45 kilometres off the coast of Ostend, Belgium, a world-first construction is underway. Standing as a fortress against the wind and waves of the North Sea, the artificial Princess Elisabeth Energy Island – due for completion in 2026 – will act as a hub taking electricity generated by offshore windfarms and distributing it to the European mainland. The island will also act as an interconnector for neighbouring countries, enabling Belgium to trade renewable energy.

In time, it is expected that Princess Elisabeth will be one of multiple energy islands that could eventually connect dozens or even hundreds of North Sea windfarms, which could collectively meet up to 20% of the EU’s entire annual electricity demand by 20504.

Across Europe, renewables are becoming the first line of defence for a bloc determined to bolster its energy resilience. With huge solar resources in the south (in recent years, Portugal has seen days where its entire electricity demand has been met renewably5) and vast wind potential in the north, the EU already obtains around 45% of its electricity from renewable sources6, and is aiming to achieve the same figure for all forms of energy (by replacing many instances where fossil fuels are currently the end-use form) by 20307.

Other major economies are taking a similar approach. Over the next five years, India is expected to invest more than USD 340 billion to install enough renewable capacity to meet the electricity needs of every household roughly twice over, making up approximately half of the country’s total electricity generation.8 And in the US, despite President Trump’s pro-oil ‘drill, baby, drill’ rhetoric, further strong renewables growth is expected in 2025, with wind, solar, geothermal and hydropower now making up around 90% of the country’s new electricity capacity added each year.9

No one is able to match China, however. Already home to more than 40% of combined global renewables capacity10, China invested a further USD 625 billion in clean energy projects in 2024 alone11, as the country continues its push to become the world’s first ‘electro-state’ and achieve its stated aim of energy independence.

Critical minerals – the new oil?

For many in the West, China’s clean energy dominance has created a new dependency problem. Wind turbines, solar panels, batteries and the millions of kilometres of new cabling needed to transition to zero-carbon electricity are reliant on ‘energy metals’ and other critical minerals, such as aluminium, cobalt, lithium, graphite and rare earth elements.

Today, China is the leading processor of 19 of the 20 most important critical minerals – with an average global refining share of 70%12 – giving President Xi and the Chinese Communist Party a powerful geopolitical weapon. As governments shift away from coal, oil and gas, the risk is that they are merely swapping one dependency for another.

In response, according to the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) policy tracker, 200 national policy interventions – half ratified in just the last few years – aim to boost domestic critical minerals supply chains13.

These include US President Donald Trump’s creation of a ‘National Energy Dominance Council’, which will treat critical minerals supply as a national security imperative14; the respective Canadian and Australian Critical Minerals Strategies; and the EU’s Critical Raw Materials Act, which aims to boost supply chain security by ensuring that, by 2030, a minimum of 10% of the critical minerals it needs are mined domestically, at least 40% are processed in the EU, and at least 25% are sourced from recycling.15

Secure supply chains create new growth opportunity

This global push is accelerating the permitting process for new mines – it is also fostering new innovations aimed at minimising reliance on overseas supply.

For example, New Zealand start-up Mint Innovation’s bio-based recycling process uses bacteria to extract target metals from electronic waste and requires just a fraction of the energy needed by traditional recycling methods – a recent partnership with Jaguar Land Rover to recover lithium, nickel and cobalt from used electric vehicle (EV) batteries has received funding from the UK government16. In Europe, Germany’s BRAIN Biotech and the EU’s Horizon-funded BioRecover project17 are working on bringing similar solutions to scale.

Across the board, metals recycling is set for rapid growth. As demand for critical minerals rises, the International Energy Agency forecasts that the size of the market for recycled minerals could rise five-fold to reach USD 200 billion by 2050, cutting the need for new mining activity for some minerals by as much as 40%.18

Efforts are also being made to sidestep critical minerals altogether, especially in the manufacture of batteries, which have become essential for the grid-scale storage needed to support renewables projects and EV uptake.

Today’s batteries are made using lithium and other single-source-dominated minerals. In April 2024, however, US-based Natron Energy, which has received significant support from federal funds, cut the ribbon on the US’s first-ever commercial-scale sodium-ion battery factory, which employs an entirely domestic supply chain and avoids the need for any hard-to-obtain critical minerals. (Natron’s growth is so rapid that the firm has already announced the site for a new USD 1.4 billion ‘giga-factory’, which will increase its manufacturing capacity 40-fold.)19

Swedish firm Altris is also developing sodium-ion batteries, with investment support from major names including Maersk Growth and Volvo.20 Like Natron, Altris’s batteries can be made from an exclusively domestic supply chain, and are largely reliant on abundant materials such as iron, salt, and even wood21. BloombergNEF forecasts that sodium-ion batteries will represent 15% of the energy storage market by 2035, up from 1% today.22

Domestic security – global potential

As global tensions mount, and multipolar dynamics deepen, it’s easy for investors to imagine a world in which nations are ‘hunkering down’ and investment opportunities diminishing.

At Lombard Odier, we believe this is to miss the bigger picture. We understand that the changing world order simply means a reshaping of where opportunities are to be found, and that as governments take measures to secure strategic industries we will see a tidal wave of new investment from both the public and private sectors.

As the world’s biggest powers invest in national energy resilience, they are building new export markets that will replace today’s fossil fuel networks. Incumbent oil exporters will see revenues fall, while winners will emerge from those offering the solutions that help nations bolster their renewable supply.

The opportunities will be many and varied – new battery technologies, metals recycling, the export of renewably-generated electricity, and high-voltage-direct-current electricity cabling (of which European companies are the world’s leading manufacturers). Domestic energy security will create global potential.

A total of 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable, the Energy Department said.
The loan guarantee will save customers money and improve reliability while supporting economic growth in the five states, said Bill Fehrman, AEP’s chairman, president and chief executive officer.
Wright, in a conference call with reporters, distinguished the AEP loan guarantee from a $4.9 billion federal loan guarantee the department cancelled in July.
The loan guarantee to AEP was among those conditionally approved under Biden, a fact Wright acknowledged to reporters.","WASHINGTON (AP/WANE) — The Department of Energy said Thursday it has finalized a $1.6 billion loan guarantee to a subsidiary of one of the nation’s largest power companies to upgrade nearly 5,000 miles of transmission lines across five states, mostly in the Midwest, for largely fossil fuel-run energy.

AEP Transmission will upgrade power lines in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia to enhance enhance grid reliability and capacity, the Energy Department said. The project, first offered under the Biden administration, is meant to help meet surging electricity demand from data centers and artificial intelligence.

Indiana Michigan Power, which is part of AEP, plans to use some of the funds for 29 projects covering more than 1,400 miles of transmission lines.

Ohio-based American Electric Power, which owns AEP Transmission, is one of the nation’s largest utilities, serving 5.6 million customers in 11 states. It primarily produces electricity from coal, natural gas and nuclear power, along with renewable resources such as wind and hydroelectric power.

Thursday’s announcement deepens the Trump administration’s commitment to traditional, polluting energy sources even as it works to discourage the U.S. from clean energy use.

Earlier this month, the administration cancelled $7.6 billion in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election. A total of 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable, the Energy Department said.

The cancellations include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub aimed at developing clean-burning hydrogen fuels to power ships and heavy-duty trucks. A hydrogen project costing up to $1 billion in the Pacific Northwest also was cancelled.

The loan guarantee finalized Thursday is the first offered by the Trump administration under the recently renamed Energy Dominance Financing program created by the massive tax-and-spending law approved this summer by congressional Republicans and signed by President Donald Trump. Electric utilities that receive loans through the program must provide assurances to the government that financial benefits from the financing will be passed on to customers, the Energy Department said.

The project and others being considered will help ensure that Americans “will have access to affordable, reliable and secure energy for decades to come,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement.

“The president has been clear: America must reverse course from the energy subtraction agenda of past administrations and strengthen our electrical grid,” Wright said, adding that modernizing the grid and expanding transmission capacity “will help position the United States to win the AI race and grow our manufacturing base.”

The upgrades supported by the federal financing will replace existing transmission lines in existing rights-of-way with new lines capable of carrying more energy, the power company said.

More than 2,000 miles of transmission lines in Ohio serving 1.5 million people will be replaced, along with more than 1,400 miles in Indiana and Michigan serving 600,000 customers, the company said. An additional 1,400 miles in Oklahoma, serving about 1.2 million people and 26 miles in West Virginia, serving 460,000 people, will be replaced.

The projects will create about 1,100 construction jobs, the company said.

The loan guarantee will save customers money and improve reliability while supporting economic growth in the five states, said Bill Fehrman, AEP’s chairman, president and chief executive officer. “The funds we will save through this program enable us to make additional investments to enhance service for our customers,” he added.

Wright, in a conference call with reporters, distinguished the AEP loan guarantee from a $4.9 billion federal loan guarantee the department cancelled in July. That money would have boosted the planned Grain Belt Express, a new high-voltage transmission line set to deliver solar and wind-generated electricity from the Midwest to eastern states.

The Energy Department said at the time it was “not critical for the federal government to have a role” in the first phase of the $11 billion project planned by Chicago-based Invenergy. The department also questioned whether the project could meet strict financial conditions required, a claim Wright repeated Thursday.

“Ultimately that is a commercial enterprise that needs private developers,” Wright said. The company has indicated the Grain Belt project will go forward.

Trump and Wright have repeatedly derided wind and solar energy as unreliable and opposed efforts to combat climate change by moving away from fossil fuels. Wright said the Grain Belt Express loan was among billions of dollars worth of commitments “rushed out the door” in the waning days of former President Joe Biden’s administration.

The loan guarantee to AEP was among those conditionally approved under Biden, a fact Wright acknowledged to reporters.

“Not all of the (Biden-era) projects were nonsense,” he said, adding that he was “happy to move forward” with the transmission upgrade.",https://www.wane.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2017/07/507754590604424BB3BF553B1B790C1E_35561226_ver1.0-e1609700625543.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-17 13:12:55.238333

“In parallel, the partnership will promote structured dialogue between the public and private sectors on the conditions necessary to build a thriving local manufacturing ecosystem.
“This cooperation will help accelerate the sector’s maturity and improve the design of future energy access interventions.
“Finally, the MoU commits both organisations to joint advocacy aimed at raising the visibility of standalone solar as a vital pillar of Nigeria’s energy strategy.","Sun King, the world’s leading off-grid solar company, has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Rural Electrification Agency (REA) to strengthen cooperation on renewable energy access, local manufacturing, and data-driven innovation.

A statement by the company said that with the enabling support from REA and wider government, it plans local manufacturing facilities that could substitute imports worth $150 million over the next five years.

The agreement, signed during REA’s Nigeria Renewable Energy Innovation Forum (NREIF) in Abuja, was witnessed by the Vice President of Nigeria, Kashim Shettima, and Sun King’s Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Patrick Walsh, marking a new phase of collaboration between the public and private sectors in accelerating Nigeria’s clean energy transition.

Sun King currently sells more than 330,000 solar kits every month across Africa, up from 10,000 in 2017. In Nigeria, Sun King’s solar sales have grown from 3,000 kits per month in 2020 to 75,000 per month today, reflecting rapid expansion and growing consumer demand for affordable, reliable power. Sun King expects to triple the number of solar kits it provides across Nigeria in the next few years.

Beyond solar systems, Sun King also designs and sells a growing range of affordable smartphones and energy-efficient appliances, such as televisions and freezers, designed to work seamlessly with its solar solutions and improve quality of life for households and businesses.

The new MoU between Sun King and the REA lays out three core areas of collaboration designed to accelerate Nigeria’s renewable energy transition and deepen local participation in the sector: supporting the ‘Nigeria First’ agenda with local assembly of select high-value products, technical cooperation through the sharing of data and knowledge to improve efficiencies and grow the sector, and joint advocacy to raise the visibility of standalone solar as a critical pillar of Nigeria’s energy strategy.

First, on manufacturing and local value creation, Sun King and REA, the statement said, will work together to advance the government’s ‘Nigeria First’ policy by increasing local participation in the renewable energy value chain.

This, it said, includes exploring the domestic assembly of select solar energy and energy-efficient appliances, creating new manufacturing and supply-chain jobs, and ensuring Nigerians capture a larger share of value from the country’s growing clean energy sector.

“In parallel, the partnership will promote structured dialogue between the public and private sectors on the conditions necessary to build a thriving local manufacturing ecosystem. By sharing practical experience from international operations and manufacturing, Sun King will contribute to discussions on how policy, infrastructure, and investment incentives can best support Nigeria’s long-term goals for industrialisation and renewable energy growth.

“Second, the partnership also prioritises deeper technical collaboration and knowledge sharing between Sun King and REA. Both parties will work to enhance data collection, market intelligence, and analytical insights to improve operational efficiency, expand the reach of energy access programmes, such as the Nigeria Electrification Project (NEP) and Distributed Access through Renewable Energy Scale-up (DARES), and identify gaps in skills and infrastructure.

“This cooperation will help accelerate the sector’s maturity and improve the design of future energy access interventions. These initiatives build on Nigeria’s successful track record with renewable energy subsidy schemes and align with Mission 300, the global drive to connect 300 million people in Africa to electricity by 2030.

“Finally, the MoU commits both organisations to joint advocacy aimed at raising the visibility of standalone solar as a vital pillar of Nigeria’s energy strategy. Together, REA and Sun King will highlight the social and economic impact of off-grid solar — its role in powering homes, schools, and small enterprises — and advocate for policies and financing mechanisms that accelerate its scale-up. This collaboration will help align public and private narratives around Nigeria’s energy future and reinforce solar as a key driver of inclusive growth,” it said.

Managing Director/CEO, REA, Abba Aliyu, said: “Sun King was the largest partner on REA’s Nigeria Electrification Programme. This next chapter goes further, linking energy access, industrial growth, and supportive policy into one unified push for Nigeria’s clean-energy future.”

According to the statement, rapid growth has already seen Sun King create over 12,000 jobs in Nigeria — from solar sales, servicing, and installation to engineering, marketing, and data.

This new agreement aims to supercharge that momentum, supporting job creation and industrial growth through closer collaboration with the government.

“This partnership unites two powerful goals — Mission 300, connecting 300 million Africans to electricity by 2030, and the Government of Nigeria’s industrialisation vision. It’s about making clean energy affordable, unlocking new manufacturing opportunities, and using shared data and insight to build stronger renewable-energy and electronics industries across Nigeria,” Walsh, Co-Founder and CEO of Sun King, said.

Rather than promoting tough reforms to lower health care costs for New Yorkers, he wants taxpayers to shovel even more money to the insurance industry.
Case in point: President Biden’s short-term COVID-era enhanced subsidies for Obamacare that Congress now wants to extend permanently.
If lawmakers truly cared about patients, they’d fight the underlying causes of runaway health care costs instead of clinging to taxpayer handouts.
President Biden’s enhanced COVID subsidies were sold as temporary relief but have morphed into regressive, fraud-ridden handouts for the well-off.","New York families already face some of the steepest health care costs in the nation, with premiums and deductibles eating up bigger chunks of household budgets every year. New York’s Department of Financial Services has warned that Obamacare premiums are climbing in 2026. While insurers initially sought a 13.5% increase, state officials approved a 7.1% rise—still enough to strain working families already juggling rising costs.

Instead of confronting the underlying reasons why health care is so expensive, lawmakers often prefer the political expediency of masking rising costs with more handouts. Sadly, New York’s own Rep. Mike Lawler (R) is opting for this very strategy. Rather than promoting tough reforms to lower health care costs for New Yorkers, he wants taxpayers to shovel even more money to the insurance industry.

In Washington, nothing is more permanent than a temporary government program. Case in point: President Biden’s short-term COVID-era enhanced subsidies for Obamacare that Congress now wants to extend permanently. For the sake of taxpayers, fiscal responsibility, and sound health care policy, Congress should let these expensive and wasteful COVID-era tax credits expire at the end of this year.

First enacted in the American Rescue Plan Act and then extended by the Inflation Reduction Act, these enhanced premium tax credits funnel taxpayer dollars directly to health insurance companies. While Obamacare’s original subsidies were tightly targeted to help lower-income families afford coverage, President Biden’s enhanced premium tax credits flipped that logic on its head and extended government largesse to upper-income households who need it least.

Biden’s COVID subsidies effectively scrapped the income cap, so now even high-earning families making six figures—or more than half a million dollars in some cases—can get taxpayer help with their health insurance. Even individuals pulling in over $250,000 qualify. Obamacare was meant to help the poor afford coverage, not hand out benefits to the wealthy.

Instead of allowing these credits to expire as intended, Democrats made their extension a red-line demand in government funding negotiations. Washington is in a government shutdown because Democrats prioritized preserving costly COVID-era subsidies over keeping the government open. The public health emergency is long over, and these pandemic credits should have ended too.

Continuing these credits comes at a huge cost to taxpayers. Extending them permanently would cost nearly $40 billion per year, more than the Department of Justice’s total budget, according to the Congressional Budget Office. With deficits near $2 trillion and interest payments rising fast, the government cannot continue to spend as if the debt doesn’t matter.

Beyond the cost, these expanded subsidies are rife with fraud and abuse. By sending billions to households with little financial need, the program encourages misreporting income and gaming the system. The IRS Inspector General reports a 26% improper payment rate—the highest of any federal health program.

To make matters worse, government data show millions of exchange enrollees never filed a single claim in 2024. Among fully subsidized enrollees, 40% had zero claims. In addition to wasting taxpayer funds, this gargantuan amount of fraud and improper enrollment erodes public trust in government.

Eager to keep their government handouts, insurance lobbyists have resorted to a dishonest campaign of fear-mongering in an attempt to strong-arm Congress into extending these enhanced subsidies. The end of Biden’s COVID sweeteners won’t leave people stranded since Obamacare’s original subsidies still pick up most of the tab for lower-income families.

Remember, the entire Obamacare subsidy is not on the chopping block—only what was expanded in 2021. For almost all enrollees under 250% of the federal poverty line, taxpayers will continue to cover the vast majority of premiums after the enhanced subsidies expire.

Notwithstanding the spin, nearly three-quarters of all current Obamacare enrollees fall under this category. If lawmakers truly cared about patients, they’d fight the underlying causes of runaway health care costs instead of clinging to taxpayer handouts.

These bigger subsidies don’t control costs, they just mask them. By shielding people from the true price of insurance, the government lets insurers keep raising premiums. After falling from 2019 to 2022, benchmark premiums jumped 3.4% in 2023, showing that subsidies don’t stop costs from rising. Rather than sticking taxpayers with the bill, Washington should pursue real fixes: more competition, less red tape, and accountability for insurers and providers.

President Biden’s enhanced COVID subsidies were sold as temporary relief but have morphed into regressive, fraud-ridden handouts for the well-off. Letting them expire isn’t radical—it’s common sense. Congress should end this costly experiment and return Obamacare to its original purpose: helping the poor afford coverage, not padding the profits of insurance companies or subsidizing the upper-middle class.",https://rocklandtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/city400_20-_20Rockland_20County_20New_20York_1200x1200.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 10:00:28.440953

These specialized materials possess unique properties essential for clean energy technologies, characterised by their supply vulnerability and strategic economic importance. Furthermore, understanding the critical minerals energy transition landscape is crucial for investors and policymakers alike.

Unlike traditional commodities such as oil or steel, critical minerals face significant supply chain risks due to geographic concentration of production and limited global processing capabilities. Lithium, cobalt, nickel, copper, and rare earth elements form the backbone of technologies that cannot easily substitute these materials without substantial performance compromises.

The strategic importance of these materials extends beyond simple economic metrics. Recent discussions at international forums highlight their central role in energy transformation. South African government officials confirmed that critical minerals dominated G20 energy transitions group meetings in October 2025, with broad agreement that energy transition will be fundamentally driven by access to these materials.

Understanding Critical Minerals and Their Role in Modern Energy Systems

Key Characteristics Defining Critical Minerals

Critical minerals exhibit several defining characteristics that separate them from conventional raw materials:

• High economic importance for deploying clean energy infrastructure at scale

• Supply chain vulnerabilities stemming from concentrated production sources

• Limited substitutability in critical applications without performance degradation

• Strategic national security implications for energy independence

Consequently, these characteristics make critical minerals essential for any comprehensive investing guide 2025 strategy.

How Critical Minerals Enable Global Energy Transformation

The fundamental shift toward renewable energy systems demands mineral-intensive technologies requiring substantially more raw materials than conventional fossil fuel infrastructure. This transformation creates unprecedented demand for specific minerals across multiple technology categories.

Technology-Specific Mineral Dependencies

Clean Energy Technology Primary Critical Minerals Required Mineral Intensity vs Conventional Energy Electric Vehicle Batteries Lithium, cobalt, nickel, graphite 6x more minerals than internal combustion engines Wind Power Generation Rare earth elements, copper, steel 9x more minerals than natural gas plants Solar Photovoltaic Systems Silver, silicon, copper, aluminum 4x more minerals than gas-fired generation Grid-Scale Energy Storage Lithium, vanadium, cobalt 16x more minerals than conventional backup power

Data compiled from International Energy Agency clean energy transition analyses

The scale of mineral requirements becomes apparent when examining individual technologies. A single electric vehicle battery demands approximately 8 kilograms of lithium, 35 kilograms of nickel, 20 kilograms of manganese, and 14 kilograms of cobalt. Meanwhile, offshore wind installations require 15 times more minerals than equivalent fossil fuel generation capacity, primarily for copper wiring, rare earth permanent magnets, and specialised steel components.

Digital Technology Integration Complexity

The clean energy transition involves more than traditional power generation equipment. Modern renewable energy systems increasingly rely on microprocessor and digital technologies for optimisation and control. Wind farms, battery storage systems, and smart grid infrastructure all depend on sophisticated digital control systems requiring additional critical minerals beyond their primary energy functions.

This digital dependency creates a secondary layer of mineral demand often overlooked in traditional analyses. Semiconductor manufacturing, essential for renewable energy control systems, requires 17 different rare earth elements alongside specialised materials like gallium, germanium, and indium.

Explosive Demand Growth Projections for Critical Minerals

Unprecedented Scale of Demand Increases

International Energy Agency forecasts reveal dramatic demand growth trajectories through 2040 across key critical minerals:

Lithium: 42-fold increase driven primarily by electric vehicle battery production and grid-scale energy storage deployment

Graphite: 25-fold increase for battery anode materials in both automotive and stationary applications

Cobalt: 21-fold increase for high-performance battery cathode chemistry requirements

Nickel: 19-fold increase supporting battery energy density improvements and stainless steel demand

Rare Earth Elements: 7-fold increase for permanent magnet applications in wind turbines and electric motors

These projections assume successful achievement of global climate targets requiring massive clean energy infrastructure deployment. The scale represents the largest raw material demand surge in modern industrial history.

Regional Demand Distribution Patterns

Asia-Pacific Region: Dominates global battery manufacturing capacity and leads electric vehicle adoption rates, creating concentrated regional demand

North America: Focuses on grid modernisation and renewable energy deployment with emphasis on supply chain localisation

Europe: Pursues aggressive decarbonisation targets through industrial electrification and renewable energy mandates

Emerging Markets: Emphasises electricity access expansion and clean energy infrastructure development

Recent data from South Africa illustrates regional energy transformation challenges. The country's electricity sector expects continued growth with no job losses anticipated, as decarbonisation efforts require both traditional and clean electricity generation. This dual requirement creates complex mineral demand patterns beyond simple renewable energy deployment.

Critical Vulnerabilities in Mineral Supply Chains

Geographic Concentration Creating Systemic Risk

Critical mineral supply chains exhibit extreme geographic concentration that creates significant vulnerabilities for global energy transition efforts. However, Australia's minerals reserve strategy offers one approach to addressing these challenges.

China's Dominant Processing Position:

• 60% of global lithium processing and refining capacity

• 80% of rare earth element separation and purification

• 70% of battery-grade mineral processing facilities

• 75% of lithium-ion battery cell manufacturing capacity

Regional Mining Concentration Patterns:

• Lithium Production: Australia (52%), Chile (25%), China (13%)

• Cobalt Extraction: Democratic Republic of Congo (70%), Russia (4%), Australia (3%)

• Rare Earth Mining: China (60%), United States (16%), Myanmar (11%)

Processing Bottlenecks as Primary Constraints

While mining operations can scale relatively quickly with sufficient investment, establishing processing and refining facilities represents the most significant constraint in critical mineral supply chains. New refining capacity development typically requires:

• 5-10 year development timelines from project conception to commercial production

• Specialised technical expertise concentrated in relatively few countries globally

• Capital investments ranging from $1-5 billion per major processing facility

• Environmental permitting processes that can extend project timelines significantly

These processing constraints create strategic vulnerabilities even when diversified mining sources exist. Raw material extraction represents only the first step in complex value chains requiring sophisticated industrial infrastructure.

National and International Policy Response Strategies

United States Strategic Initiatives

The Inflation Reduction Act, while enacted under the previous administration, continues influencing critical mineral policies through 2025. Key provisions include substantial clean energy investment incentives, tax benefits for domestic mineral processing development, and frameworks for strategic partnerships with allied nations producing critical minerals.

However, the current political landscape may affect implementation priorities and funding allocations for these programs. Fast-track permitting processes for strategic mineral projects remain under policy review.

European Union Critical Raw Materials Framework

The European Union's Critical Raw Materials Act establishes ambitious targets including 10% domestic production requirements by 2030 and 25% recycling targets for key strategic minerals. The €3 billion European Raw Materials Alliance represents significant funding for supply chain development initiatives.

Strategic partnerships with resource-rich nations form a cornerstone of EU policy, emphasising diversification away from concentrated supply sources while building processing capabilities within European borders.

Australian Resource Development Strategy

Australia's $2 billion Critical Minerals Facility focuses on developing domestic processing capabilities beyond traditional raw material exports. The strategy emphasises value-added manufacturing, research partnerships with international institutions, and export market diversification programs.

International Cooperation Mechanisms

The Minerals Security Partnership coordinates supply chain resilience efforts among major economies through:

• Joint infrastructure investment in processing facilities across multiple countries

• Shared technical standards and certification systems for sustainable mining practices

• Coordinated strategic stockpiling approaches for supply security

• Alternative supply route development reducing single-point-of-failure risks

Environmental Impact Challenges in Mineral Extraction

Water Resource Consumption and Scarcity

Critical mineral extraction operations often occur in water-stressed regions, creating significant environmental pressures that complicate sustainable development efforts. In addition, addressing these challenges requires comprehensive mining sustainability transformation approaches.

Lithium Brine Operations:

• Consume approximately 500,000 gallons of water per ton of lithium produced

• Concentrated primarily in arid South American salt flat regions

• Impact local groundwater systems and fragile desert ecosystem balance

Copper Mining Water Requirements:

• Require 200-300 tons of water per ton of refined copper

• Generate acid mine drainage risks affecting watershed quality

• Compete with agricultural and municipal water needs in mining regions

Biodiversity and Ecosystem Disruption

Expanding mineral extraction threatens sensitive ecosystems across multiple continents:

• Deep-sea mining for polymetallic nodules containing cobalt and rare earth elements risks disrupting unknown marine ecosystems

• Rainforest operations in the Amazon basin threaten biodiversity hotspots while accessing mineral deposits

• Desert mining activities disrupt fragile arid ecosystem balance with long-term recovery challenges

Environmental impact assessments increasingly recognise these trade-offs between clean energy deployment and ecosystem preservation, requiring more sophisticated approaches to sustainable mineral extraction.

Circular Economy Solutions for Supply Constraints

Battery Recycling Recovery Potential

End-of-life battery recycling represents a growing opportunity to address critical mineral supply constraints. Moreover, implementing effective battery recycling solutions becomes increasingly vital. Industry projections suggest recycling could provide significant mineral recovery by 2040:

• Lithium recovery potential: 25% of projected total demand through advanced recycling technologies

• Cobalt recovery rates: 35% of demand addressable through battery recycling programs

• Nickel recovery capacity: 20% of total demand recoverable from spent battery materials

Urban Mining Resource Opportunities

Electronic waste streams contain concentrated critical minerals often exceeding natural ore grades:

• Rare earth concentrations in smartphones contain 17 different strategic elements in accessible forms

• Gold content in electronic waste typically runs 40-50 times higher than primary mining ore grades

• Platinum group metals from automotive catalytic converters offer readily recoverable material streams

Design Innovation for Material Circularity

Emerging design approaches aim to reduce primary mineral demand through improved circularity:

• Modular battery architectures enabling easier disassembly and component recovery

• Digital material passports tracking mineral content throughout product lifecycles

• Product-as-a-service models retaining manufacturer ownership to optimise material recovery

• Standardised component designs across manufacturers facilitating recycling efficiency

Technological Alternatives Reducing Mineral Dependencies

Next-Generation Battery Chemistry Development

Research into alternative battery technologies shows promise for reducing critical mineral requirements:

Sodium-ion Battery Systems: Eliminate lithium and cobalt requirements entirely while using abundant sodium resources globally

Iron-air Energy Storage: Utilise widely available iron materials for long-duration grid storage applications

Solid-state Battery Technology: Reduce overall material requirements by 30-40% compared to conventional lithium-ion designs

Aluminum-ion Batteries: Leverage abundant aluminum resources though commercial viability remains under development

Strategic Material Substitution Advances

Material science research enables strategic substitutions across clean energy technologies:

• Rare earth-free electric motors using advanced ferrite magnet designs with comparable performance

• Copper alternatives including specialised aluminum alloys and carbon fibre conductors

• Cobalt-free battery cathodes using iron phosphate chemistry with improved safety characteristics

• Synthetic graphite production replacing natural graphite sources through advanced manufacturing

These technological developments remain largely in research phases, with commercial deployment timelines varying significantly across different applications.

Geopolitical Implications of Critical Mineral Control

Resource Diplomacy Evolution

Critical minerals fundamentally reshape international relationships through new forms of resource diplomacy:

• Strategic bilateral partnerships between consuming nations and mineral-producing countries

• Technology transfer agreements providing processing capabilities in exchange for supply security

• Investment protection treaties safeguarding mineral supply chain infrastructure investments

• Trade agreement provisions incorporating mineral security alongside traditional economic considerations

Emerging Geopolitical Power Dynamics

Countries controlling critical mineral resources gain enhanced international leverage comparable to historical oil producer influence:

• Chile and Argentina dominate lithium triangle resources controlling global lithium supply fundamentals

• Democratic Republic of Congo holds majority global cobalt reserves creating supply concentration risks

• Indonesia rapidly expands nickel processing capacity while implementing export restrictions

• Australia maintains diverse critical mineral portfolio across multiple strategic materials

The South African context illustrates these dynamics, as the country balances energy security needs with climate commitments. Government officials acknowledge the complex challenge of maintaining current energy supply while transitioning to lower-carbon systems, requiring careful diplomatic and economic balancing.

Investment Landscape and Market Opportunities

Market Scale and Growth Trajectory

The critical minerals sector represents unprecedented investment opportunities driven by clean energy transition requirements:

• Current global market value: Estimated at $320 billion across all critical mineral categories

• 2030 projected market size: $750 billion reflecting accelerated clean energy deployment

• Annual growth rates: 12-15% sustained growth expected through 2040

Strategic Investment Categories

Upstream Development Opportunities:

• Exploration and resource development projects in underexplored regions

• Advanced extraction technology deployment improving recovery rates

• Processing and refining facility development reducing geographic concentration

Midstream Infrastructure Investments:

• Battery manufacturing capacity expansion across multiple regions

• Recycling infrastructure development creating circular material flows

• Supply chain logistics optimisation reducing transportation bottlenecks

Downstream Application Markets:

• Energy storage system deployment supporting grid modernisation

• Electric vehicle manufacturing capacity expansion

• Renewable energy project development creating sustained mineral demand

Regional Investment Context

The South African energy sector illustrates investment complexities in emerging markets. The country's oil and gas industry contributes over 250,000 jobs while facing infrastructure challenges including refinery closures and distribution system reliability issues.

This economic reality demonstrates the investment challenge of balancing immediate energy security needs with long-term clean energy transition goals. Countries require substantial capital for both maintaining existing energy systems and building new clean energy infrastructure simultaneously.

Navigating the Critical Minerals Challenge

Critical minerals in energy transition represent both unprecedented opportunity and significant risk for global decarbonisation efforts. The scale of demand growth creates massive market opportunities while supply chain vulnerabilities and environmental concerns require coordinated international responses. Additionally, insights from UNEP's critical energy transition minerals report highlight the urgency of addressing these challenges.

Success in managing this transition depends on several critical factors:

Supply Chain Diversification: Moving beyond current geographic concentrations through strategic partnerships and infrastructure development across multiple regions and countries.

Circular Infrastructure Investment: Creating comprehensive recycling systems that transform waste streams into valuable material inputs, reducing primary extraction pressures.

Alternative Technology Development: Advancing research into materials and technologies that reduce dependencies on the most constrained critical minerals without compromising performance.

Environmental Standards Integration: Ensuring responsible mining practices that balance clean energy deployment with ecosystem protection and social equity.

International Cooperation Frameworks: Building collaborative approaches that share risks, costs, and benefits of critical mineral supply security across multiple stakeholders.

The nations and organisations that successfully navigate these interconnected challenges will secure competitive advantages in the emerging clean energy economy. Those that fail to address supply vulnerabilities, environmental impacts, or technological alternatives risk significant disadvantages in the global energy transformation currently reshaping economic and geopolitical relationships worldwide.

Recent industry discussions emphasise that this transformation requires balancing immediate energy needs with long-term sustainability goals. As energy sector professionals noted at recent conferences, countries face the complex challenge of maintaining current energy supply while simultaneously building the infrastructure necessary for future clean energy systems. This dual requirement creates both investment opportunities and policy challenges that will define the next decade of energy development globally.

Because NEPA is merely procedural, it has suffered a death by 1,000 cuts accumulated over the decades.
Yet, the EA’s draft decision claims this behemoth project will have no significant environmental impact.","Our leaders are letting the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) die. But, maybe that’s okay. It’s time for a National Environmental Protection Act.

By the 1960s, century-accumulated costs of “progress” highlighted the need for new legislation. Rachel Carson had documented the effects of pesticides in Silent Spring. American Interstate System construction was bulldozing communities and ecosystems. Ohio’s Cuyahoga River caught fire—again. The Senate Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs opined that we were destroying our environment because of an information deficit, and NEPA would correct this.

A “procedural” statute, NEPA doesn’t mandate less environmentally destructive outcomes. Instead, its language suggests that the authors believed a government, in cooperation with its people, would make better choices with better information: a policy “to promote efforts which will prevent or eliminate damage to the environment and biosphere ….” Congress would execute this policy by requiring federal agencies to produce detailed statements—environmental impact statements (EISs)—on major federal actions. EISs would disclose foreseeable and adverse environmental impacts that could not be avoided and consider reasonable alternatives.

NEPA is the process that enables Wilderness Watch, and our supporters, to inform various federal agencies how proposed activities would impact Wilderness and whether they comply with the Wilderness Act. This has included stream-poisoning projects, predator-killing decisions, and proposals to reintroduce livestock to places in Wilderness where grazing has been absent for decades. Anyone who has commented on a project the agency is considering has likely done so under NEPA.

Because NEPA is merely procedural, it has suffered a death by 1,000 cuts accumulated over the decades.

All three branches of our government and both political parties bear responsibility for NEPA’s demise. In May’s judicial bludgeoning, the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) narrowed the scope of environmental review with blinders, allowing the U.S. Surface Transportation Board to view 88 miles of proposed railway in Utah without considering how the project would enable upstream fossil fuel production and downstream fuel refining by geographically connecting them. The Court reiterated NEPA as a “purely procedural statute that…simply requires the agency to prepare an EIS—in essence, a report.” In condoning compartmentalized environmental analysis over the bigger picture, SCOTUS summarized how our government regards NEPA nowadays. NEPA is a procedural hurdle on the way to an inevitable project. Sometimes the public can pause it, but only temporarily.

Many agencies in this current administration just transitioned their NEPA regulations into meaningless fluff that disempowers the public, but the accumulation of less flagrant offenses over the years led to this moment. The environmental assessment (EA)—originally created to ascertain whether significant impacts are possible and thus whether an EIS must proceed—has been inappropriately utilized at ever-broadening scales. For example, the Forest Service has recently conducted an EA for a 2.4 million-acre forestwide burn project—which includes 842,000 acres of Wilderness—in the Sequoia and Sierra national forests in California. The project will have no end and will indiscriminately burn Wilderness, roadless, botanical, and research areas. This is the largest intervention and manipulation project ever proposed for Wilderness. Yet, the EA’s draft decision claims this behemoth project will have no significant environmental impact.

In another example, when the public told the National Park Service (NPS) in 2018 that it hadn’t justified how killing half of the mountain goats on the Olympic Peninsula and helicoptering the other half into the North Cascades—impacting eight Wilderness areas— was the best environmental choice, NPS maintained it neither had to identify nor choose the “environmentally preferred alternative.”

One last example: The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) received 34,783 comments on a proposal to build the Ambler Road in Alaska, which would run adjacent to and negatively impact the Gates of the Arctic Wilderness. BLM counted 30,000 of these opposition comments as “one” because they were “standardized letters” with the same text, minimizing that 30,000 people agreed with the ideas in the letter, enough so to spend their own time submitting a copy. These offenses occur regardless of who heads the executive branch.

Congress also has contributed to the fall of NEPA. In the “Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003” (HFRA), Congress allowed the Forest Service to designate “treatment” areas without NEPA review, and created categorical exclusions (CEs) that allow logging in those areas, adding more CEs in decades since. The Council of Environmental Quality initially created CEs to avoid NEPA processes for actions with highly unlikely environmental impacts, enabling agencies to avoid environmental reviews for activities like mowing lawns at Forest Service ranger stations. Congress used HFRA to transform this administrative feature into legislative loopholes bypassing NEPA, deeming that 3,000 acres of logging (which underwent EISs in the 1990s) has “no environmental impact” simply because lawmakers don’t want to believe it. The “Fix Our Forests Act” bill pending in Congress elevates this to a macabre level, excising the public and NEPA with “fireshed” designations within which 10,000-acre CEs are permissible— so logging, burning, and grazing may proceed largely unexamined and unchallenged.",https://www.counterpunch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Mountain-goat-nanny-and-kids-by-Sam-Parks.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 13:11:55.976852

Delays, however, remain a risk.

The Golden Pass venture, backed by QatarEnergy and ExxonMobil, has sought a deadline extension until 2029 after contractor Zachry Group filed for bankruptcy, forcing a partial suspension of construction earlier this year. The joint venture told regulators that labor and equipment bottlenecks have pushed first LNG production beyond 2025, though some commissioning work continues at the Texas site, according to East Daley Analytics and RBN Energy.

Venture Global’s Plaquemines LNG project in Louisiana is targeting late 2026 for Phase 1 and mid-2027 for full capacity after revising its capital cost by roughly $2 billion to reflect higher construction and materials expenses, per Reuters. The developer has secured long-term supply agreements covering nearly all 20 million tonnes per year of capacity, and recently asked federal regulators for an extension to align the project’s schedule, according to the Federal Register notice.

Driftwood LNG, now operating under the name Louisiana LNG Infrastructure, began site work in September 2025 following a change in ownership to Woodside Energy. The $17.5 billion project, located near Sulphur, Louisiana, has received new state and federal permits but remains in early construction with no confirmed commissioning date, according to KPLC News.

While the protectionist strategy may work for now, industry analysts say the rapid expansion of Chinese EVs across the world is just getting started. What that means is that — at a minimum — it soon could be much more difficult for American carmakers to sell EVs outside the United States.

“Chinese cars are pouring at a breathtaking pace into virtually every nation in every time zone — except the United States and Canada,” wrote Michael Dunne, an auto analyst who follows China’s car market closely, in a research note this week. “Never in a hundred years has the auto industry witnessed such explosive growth in exports from a single country.”

The rapid growth could help reduce global greenhouse gas pollution, but it also presents a problem for older, established car companies, particularly in the United States. The Trump administration eliminated regulations and financial incentives that were intended to push the U.S. car industry toward electrification.

In the short term, analysts expect new EV sales in the United States will drop after a record-setting stretch earlier this year. And going forward, the big Detroit companies could find themselves boxed out of China and other growing markets — and struggling against low-price competition in Europe.

“Certainly the Chinese have committed to dominate this marketplace and we are going to have to work harder to compete against them,” said Genevieve Cullen, president of the Electric Drive Transportation Association.

China has spent more than a decade supporting both private and state-run companies that build EVs, manufacture batteries, and mine the lithium and other critical materials needed for the whole process.

As a result, China now has more than 100 car companies, who produce more than half the vehicles sold in the country. EVs, hybrids and fuel-cell vehicles have come to dominate the market, which has cut into sales of Western-made gasoline-powered cars.

Tesla, the biggest American EV maker, saw its sales in China slump through the first eight months of 2025, before making a modest 2.8 percent bounce in September, Reuters reported. General Motors said its sales rose in China in the third quarter of this year, but the company saw its sales drop sharply in 2024.

Meanwhile, Chinese car companies are exporting more vehicles, according to the Associated Press.

Chinese companies have sold 18 percent of the EVs in Europe so far in 2025 — up from 2 percent in 2020, according to data from Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. In the United Kingdom, BYD alone saw its sales grow nearly ninefold in September from the same month in 2024.

In Asian countries outside China, Chinese companies accounted for 30 percent of EV sales in 2025, up from 1 percent in 2020. Across Mexico and Central and South America, EV adoption has been slower than Europe, but Chinese companies sold more than 80 percent of the EVs, up from virtually nothing in 2020, according to Benchmark.

A big advantage for China is its access to the resources and components needed to build EVs.

That’s helped Beijing on several levels; China for example has restricted exports of rare-earth magnets as part of its ongoing trade war with the Trump administration.

Yet the growth of China’s EV sector won’t provide a silver bullet to the country’s climate goals. And it comes with some cost, too.

The country’s EV boom — coupled with growth in wind and solar power — decreased China’s use of fossil fuels by 2 percent in the first half of 2025, compared to the first half of 2024, according to a recent think tank report. But China remains the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases. In addition, its auto and battery industries have a history of brutal workplace practices — including forced labor.

Still, Western automakers are watching the growth with alarm.

In Germany, Volkswagen and other carmakers have found themselves with spare factory capacity as the newcomers cut into demand for domestic vehicles, according to the consulting firm AlixPartners.

Ford CEO Jim Farley, who has test-driven Chinese EVs, called the upstart industry “an existential threat.” But if there is a silver lining for the United States, competition from China could spur the U.S. automakers to start producing more, and cheaper, EVs.

U.S. companies already have invested billions of dollars to develop EVs, and prices could drop as production increases, said Ben Prochazka, executive director of the nonprofit Electrification Coalition.

Even so, the industry may still need help to compete with government-supported Chinese companies, he said.

“We all need to be thinking about strong demand side policies that ensure that the U.S. manufacturers could succeed in this global competition,” he said.

U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports will buy the industry time, but there are real risks if the industry doesn’t adapt.

The U.S. could become an isolated market where buyers are stuck with more expensive, gas-powered vehicles while the rest of the world shifts to cheaper EVs, Robbie Orvis, an analyst at the think tank Energy Innovation, wrote in an email.

“Unless U.S. automakers can quickly figure out how to bring down manufacturing costs and improve their vehicle offerings, they will continue to lose market share outside the U.S.,” Orvis wrote.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/10/7f/359b3e9e4776bc37a199019f631e/brazil-byd-63046.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 12:15:21.387585

Today White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump had “found a creative solution to keep the troops paid. And rather than congratulate the president for doing that, this unprecedented action to get our troops paid, the Democrats want to sue him for it. They’re saying that it’s illegal.”

Democrats are saying it’s illegal because it is illegal. The Antideficiency Act, a law that has evolved over time since 1870, prohibits the government from spending money that Congress has not appropriated for that purpose, or agreeing to contracts that spend money Congress has not appropriated for that purpose.

This summer, Democratic senators charged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem with triggering the Antideficiency Act by overspending her department’s budget, but Trump’s claim that he can move government money around as he wishes is an even greater threat to the country than Noem’s overspending.

There is more at stake here than a broken law.

Trump’s assumption of power over the government’s purse is a profound attack on the principles on which the Founders justified independence from King George III in 1776. The Founders stood firm on the principle articulated all the way back to the Magna Carta in 1215 that the government could not spend money without consulting those putting up that money by paying taxes.

That principle was at the heart of the American Revolution. The 1773 Tea Act that sparked Sons of Liberty in Boston, Massachusetts, to throw chests of tea into Boston Harbor did not raise the price of tea in the colonies; the law lowered those prices. To pay for the cost of what colonists knew as the French and Indian War, Parliament in 1767 had taxed glass, lead, oil, paint, paper, and tea, but boycotts and protests had forced Parliament to repeal all the taxes except the one on tea. It kept that tax to maintain the principle that it could tax the colonies despite the fact they were unrepresented in that body.

Then, in 1773, Parliament gave a monopoly on colonial tea sales to the foundering British East India Tea Company. That monopoly would have the effect of lowering the price of tea. Lower prices should persuade colonists to buy the tea despite the tax, thus cementing the principle that Parliament could tax the colonies without their consent. But colonists protested the maneuver. In December 1773, the Sons of Liberty held what became known as the Boston Tea Party, ruining newly arrived chests of tea by throwing them into the harbor, thus paving the route to the American Revolution.

When leaders from the former colonies wrote the U.S. Constitution in 1787, they made sure the people retained control over the nation’s finances in order to guarantee that a demagogue could not use tax money to concentrate power in his own hands. They gave the power to write the laws to the legislative branch—the House of Representatives and the Senate—alone, giving the president power only to agree to or veto those measures. Once the laws were enacted, the president’s role was to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.”

To make sure that the power of the purse remained in the hands of the people, the Framers wrote into the Constitution that “[a]ll Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives.”

Trump’s declaration that he will ignore the laws Congress passed and take it upon himself to spend money as he wishes undermines not just the Antideficiency Act but also the fundamental principle that the American people must have control over their own finances. That Leavitt suggests giving up that principle to pay the troops, which lawmakers agree is imperative but cannot write into law because Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) will not recall the House of Representatives, echoes the Tea Act that would have thrown away the principle of having a say in government for cheaper tea.

Since Trump took office, his administration has undermined the principle that Congress controls funding. It had withheld funds Congress appropriated, a practice that violates the 1974 Impoundment Act and the Constitution. The cost of such impoundment became evident on Sunday, when catastrophic flooding hit the village of Kipnuk, Alaska, a disaster Andrew Freedman of CNN notes was exacerbated by the lack of weather data after cuts left a critical shortage in weather balloon coverage in the area.

Earlier this year the administration cancelled a $20 million Biden-era Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) grant awarded to the community to prevent flooding. Maxine Joselow and Lisa Friedman of the New York Times noted that when EPA administrator Lee Zeldin cut grants this year, he boasted that he was eliminating “wasteful [diversity, equity, and inclusion] and Environmental Justice grants.”

Now that the government is shut down, Trump has told reporters that his administration is using the shutdown to take funds Congress appropriated away from Democratic districts. Tony Romm and Lazaro Gamio of the New York Times estimate that the administration has cancelled more than $27.24 billion in funds for Democratic districts and states while cutting $738.7 million from Republican districts and states. Speaker Johnson told reporters he thought such withholding was both lawful and constitutional but did not explain his reasoning.

Today Annie Grayer and Adam Cancryn of CNN reported that not just Democratic representatives but also Republicans are out of the loop of presidential funding cuts, finding out about cuts to their districts through press releases. Even Senator Susan Collins (R-ME), the chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said “we are really not consulted.”

Speaker Johnson told CNN that he hasn’t received details about the administration’s offer of $20 billion in public money and another $20 billion in private-sector financing to Argentina to prop up the government of Trump’s right-wing ally Javier Milei before upcoming elections there.

Trump is also taking control of the previously nonpartisan Department of Justice (DOJ). Yesterday, in the Oval Office, Trump stood in front of three top officials from the DOJ and called for investigations into former deputy attorney general in the Biden administration Lisa Monaco; former FBI official Andrew Weissman, who led the team investigating the ties between Trump’s 2016 campaign and Russian operatives; former special counsel Jack Smith, who investigated and indicted Trump for the events of January 6 and for retaining classified documents; and Representative Adam Schiff (D-CA), who led the House impeachment team in Trump’s first impeachment trial.

Glenn Thrush of the New York Times noted the DOJ officials “smiled, nodded and shuffled in place as he spoke.”

Today a federal grand jury in Maryland indicted John Bolton, who served as national security advisor in Trump’s first term, alleging that he shared classified information in the form of a diary with two of his relatives. That material later informed his book The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir, which covered his time in the first Trump administration and so infuriated Trump that he tried to stop its publication.

The grand jury charged Bolton with eight counts of communicating secret information with those not entitled to receive it, and ten counts of having unauthorized possession of documents containing secret information. These charges are similar to those Jack Smith brought against Trump himself, although Trump’s election to a second term stopped that prosecution.

The indictment references Bolton’s criticism of the Trump administration’s handling of secret information, in particular Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s use of the Signal messaging app to plan a military strike on the Houthis in Yemen, especially after a journalist had been added to the call, and Hegseth’s additional Signal chat about the strike with family and friends.

A court will determine the merits of the case against Bolton, but there is no doubt it is intended to send a signal to others in government that Trump will persecute those whom he perceives as disloyal.

Today, Steady State, a group made up of more than 340 former U.S. intelligence officers from the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, the State Department, and other intelligence agencies, released a report assessing the state of American democracy. Applying the tools of their craft to the U.S., they assess that the nation is “on a trajectory toward competitive authoritarianism: a system in which elections, courts, and other democratic institutions persist in form but are systematically manipulated to entrench executive control.”

The report, titled Accelerating Authoritarian Dynamics: Assessment of Democratic Decline, finds that American democracy is weakening as the Executive Branch is consolidating power and “actively weaponizing state institutions to punish perceived opponents and shield allies,” and that Congress is refusing to check the president, “creating openings for authoritarian exploitation.”

“We judge that the primary driver of the U.S.’s increasing authoritarianism is the increased frequency of Executive Branch overreach,” the report says, noting that “President Donald J. Trump has leveraged emergency powers, executive orders, federalized military forces, and bureaucratic politicization to consolidate control and weaken checks and balances.”

But the Trump administration is increasingly unpopular. Trump loyalists are working overtime to portray those who oppose the administration as anti-American criminals and terrorists. Today White House press secretary Leavitt told the Fox News Channel that “[t]he Democrat Party’s main constituency are [sic] made up of Hamas terrorists, illegal aliens, and violent criminals,” and administration loyalists have spent the week claiming that the No Kings rally scheduled for Saturday, October 18, is a “hate America rally.”

Joe Perticone of The Bulwark noted that Indivisible, the organization sponsoring the No Kings protests, “has an extensive track record that shows a longstanding emphasis on safety and nonviolence.” Perticone spoke to Ezra Levin, co–executive director of Indivisible, who said: “Go to a No Kings rally. What do you see? You see moms and grandmas and kids and dogs and funny signs and dancing and happy displays of opposition to the regime that are foundationally nonviolent. And on the other end, you’ve got a regime that’s led by a guy who cheered the January 6th insurrection.”

Levin noted that authoritarian regimes fear mass organizing and peaceful protest because they reveal a regime’s unpopularity and show that it is losing its grip on power.

Much as tossing chests of tea into Boston Harbor did about 250 years ago.

One reason for the shift is that Congress has been sidelined from any effort to deal with the fallout as the Trump administration takes the lead.
""What's so simple at the heart of this is should people who have health care in 2025 that's helped by the tax credits have access to that health care in 2026?""
Thune says he has offered Democrats a vote on a proposal to address health care subsidies, but he cannot guarantee an outcome.
Referring to Senate Democrats, Thune said, ""these are not people who want to get things done.","With the Trump administration staving off some of the most painful impacts of the government shutdown, and a federal court ruling pausing layoffs for thousands of federal workers, the sense of urgency on Capitol Hill for a way out of the stalemate may be gone — at least for right now.

In past shutdowns, Congress passed legislation to cover paychecks for the military, while headlines about things like closed national parks and shuttered agencies unable to provide services turned up the heat on both parties.

With this shutdown, the dynamic is different. Day after day, top congressional leaders hold dueling press conferences, but there are no serious negotiations and the House hasn't voted in weeks. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., says he has no plans for the chamber to return until Senate Democrats break their opposition to a stopgap bill passed by the House to fund federal agencies through November 21.

After a 10th Senate vote to fund the government failed to advance on Thursday, Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt, said efforts to end the shutdown were ""nowhere."" The Senate wrapped up business and went home, ensuring the shutdown will stretch into a fourth week.

One reason for the shift is that Congress has been sidelined from any effort to deal with the fallout as the Trump administration takes the lead.

On Tuesday, the White House Office of Management and Budget said in a post on social media that it was ""making every preparation to batten down the hatches and ride out the Democrats' intransigence.""

The administration's efforts have taken several forms. The Pentagon shifted money around to cover the Oct. 15 paychecks of servicemembers. The administration tapped $300 million in tariff revenue to keep a nutrition program for low-income women and children operational. And on Thursday, it said it would ensure that 70,000 law enforcement officers across the Department of Homeland Security — including at TSA and ICE — would be paid ""for all hours worked during the shutdown period.""

OMB did not respond to a request for comment about additional plans to cover pay for law enforcement or other federal workers, or what kind of additional layoffs might be announced. President Trump has said ""Democrat programs"" would be cut and face permanent layoffs or closures, but no details have been released yet.

Predicting tough days ahead

Democrats broadly argue that the administration's moves are illegal, and that there's bipartisan support for bills to cover the costs of pay for soldiers and aid for low-income women and children.

And while the administration's efforts may have delayed some pain from the shutdown for targeted programs and agencies, Democrats say the moves are also prolonging the impasse by removing pressure points that served to push the parties to negotiate in the past.

The approach ""may or may not take some pressure off,"" according to Welch, but he said it's not sustainable.

Earlier this week House GOP Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., praised the president for ensuring soldiers did not miss their most recent paycheck. But more widespread impacts ""are just getting started,"" he warned.

""Airports will be flooded with flight cancellations and delays amid the busiest time to travel all year, and the list goes on and on,"" Emmer said.

Democrats are using their only point of leverage in the minority — denying the GOP enough votes to advance the stopgap funding bill passed by the House — as a way to force a debate about expiring health care subsidies. They believe the public is increasingly understanding that significant premium spikes are on the horizon if Congress doesn't act, and that could force the GOP to the table.

Rep. James Walkinshaw, D-Va., is among those who believe pressure on the GOP may soon grow. Walkinshaw represents a suburban district outside of Washington with a large number of federal workers.

He says there is currently no legal mechanism to pay air traffic controllers, or a way to address what he described as the unpredictable markets facing farmers due to President Trump's tariff policies.

""Every day that the shutdown continues, it's harder for the administration to try to play whack -a-mole and mitigate impacts.""

November 1 could be a key date

November 1 is the beginning of open enrollment for people getting coverage through the Affordable Care Act. Most states will send notices laying out the cost of coverage without federal subsidies, and lawmakers on both sides openly admit the shutdown could extend for weeks. Democrats believe that could act as a mechanism to change things on Capitol Hill.

""What's so simple at the heart of this is should people who have health care in 2025 that's helped by the tax credits have access to that health care in 2026?"" Welch said in an interview. He said that in Vermont notices started going out on October 15, with some families facing increases of $25,000.

""This is all about all our families, it's not a red state, blue state deal, or who you voted for,"" according to Welch.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said he's happy to sit down with Democrats, but he has stressed that any health care deal ""happens after they open up the government."" Thune says he has offered Democrats a vote on a proposal to address health care subsidies, but he cannot guarantee an outcome.

Referring to Senate Democrats, Thune said, ""these are not people who want to get things done. These are people who want to fight Trump and appease all the people who are coming into town this weekend,"" he told reporters, referring to a ""No Kings"" rally sponsored by progressive activists groups opposing the Trump administration's policies.

Democrats see Trump as the only person who can change the current dynamic. Many cite his love of a ""deal"" and the fact that voters in red states who backed him rely on the tax credits more than those in blue states.

""As soon as he gets engaged this thing can resolve within a day or two,"" Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., told reporters on Thursday.

Some large-cap stocks are past their peak, and StockStory is here to help you separate the winners from the laggards. That said, here are three S&P 500 stocks that don’t make the cut and some better choices instead.

Akamai Technologies (AKAM)

Market Cap: $10.46 billion

With a massive distributed network spanning 4,100+ points of presence in nearly 130 countries, Akamai Technologies (NASDAQ: AKAM) provides a global distributed cloud platform that helps businesses deliver, secure, and optimize their digital experiences online.

Why Should You Dump AKAM?

Sales trends were unexciting over the last two years as its 5.6% annual growth was well below the typical software company

Gross margin of 59.1% is way below its competitors, leaving less money to invest in areas like marketing and R&D

Customer acquisition costs take a while to recoup, making it difficult to justify sales and marketing investments that could increase revenue

At $73.11 per share, Akamai Technologies trades at 2.5x forward price-to-sales. Check out our free in-depth research report to learn more about why AKAM doesn’t pass our bar.

Microchip Technology (MCHP)

Market Cap: $35.27 billion

Spun out from General Instrument in 1987, Microchip Technology (NASDAQ: MCHP) is a leading provider of microcontrollers and integrated circuits used mainly in the automotive world, especially in electric vehicles and their charging devices.

Why Do We Avoid MCHP?

Sales tumbled by 4.2% annually over the last five years, showing market trends are working against its favor during this cycle

Performance over the past five years shows each sale was less profitable as its earnings per share dropped by 18.5% annually, worse than its revenue

Free cash flow margin dropped by 15.8 percentage points over the last five years, implying the company became more capital intensive as competition picked up

Microchip Technology’s stock price of $64.21 implies a valuation ratio of 37.2x forward P/E. If you’re considering MCHP for your portfolio, see our FREE research report to learn more.

Norfolk Southern (NSC)

Market Cap: $64.72 billion

Starting with a single route from Virginia to North Carolina, Norfolk Southern (NYSE: NSC) is a freight transportation company operating a major railroad network across the eastern United States.

Why Should You Sell NSC?

Weak unit sales over the past two years imply it may need to invest in improvements to get back on track

Anticipated sales growth of 2.7% for the next year implies demand will be shaky

Earnings per share have dipped by 4.5% annually over the past two years, which is concerning because stock prices follow EPS over the long term

Norfolk Southern is trading at $286.51 per share, or 22.2x forward P/E. To fully understand why you should be careful with NSC, check out our full research report (it’s free for active Edge members).

CenterPoint Energy launches cold weather communications campaign to help customers address Energy Information Administration forecast of increases in winter gas costs

INDIANAPOLIS - Oct. 15, 2025 - Today, as part of its commitment to supporting its customers in its Indiana North natural gas service territory, CenterPoint Energy is launching a customer communication campaign encouraging eligible customers to take advantage of a series of support programs, including energy efficiency and bill assistance resources ahead of this winter heating season.

CenterPoint, as well as other Indiana natural gas utilities, is taking action in response to nationwide industry forecasts, including the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) annual Winter Heating Outlook , that indicate that gas customers across the Midwest will see higher residential bills compared to last year, as a result of rising fuel costs. The campaign, which will include social media and direct outreach to customers, is aimed at helping customers plan and prepare for the potential impact of rising fuel costs nationwide.

While the agency anticipates stable year-over-year pricing nationally, the EIA projects higher gas prices in the Midwest due to higher expenditures.

""Given seasonal forecasts, including EIA's, of an increase to the cost of natural gas, we are concerned about the potential for rising fuel prices to impact our customers' bills this winter. While CenterPoint doesn't control the price of natural gas or determine how fuel costs impact customer bills, we are committed to supporting our customers, especially those who may need help paying their energy bill. We encourage all those who may have difficulty paying their bill to plan ahead and take advantage of our customer support programs and energy-saving resources during the winter heating season,"" said Mike Roeder, CenterPoint's Senior Vice President, External Affairs.

Financial Assistance and Customer Support Programs

CenterPoint encourages customers to take advantage of payment assistance options and energy-saving programs to help manage their winter bills, including:

Customer Assistance Fund (CAF): Direct bill support is available to eligible Indiana customers who may be facing financial challenges. Administered in partnership with The Salvation Army Indiana Division and supported by CenterPoint, the CAF features an easy and accessible application process. More information is available at CenterPointEnergy.com/CAF.

Summary of Key Facts

Utilities are not permitted to mark up the cost of natural gas. Natural gas is a commodity traded in a national, deregulated market, where prices fluctuate daily with supply and demand.

CenterPoint does not control or profit from the cost of natural gas. CenterPoint purchases natural gas on behalf of its customers and then passes those costs on to customers through the gas cost adjustment, which is listed on the bill as ""Gas Cost Charge."" Only gas costs actually incurred and approved by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission are recovered from customers. Natural gas costs are calculated separately from electric bills.

Industry forecasts, including the Energy Information Administration (EIA) annual Winter Heating Outlook point to higher residential bills this year compared to last.

Due to the forecasted increase in natural gas commodity prices, CenterPoint estimates the average residential household could expect to pay an average of approximately $112 per month over the five-month heating season (November-March), compared to approximately $105 per month last year - an increase of approximately 6% due to the price of natural gas. Actual bills vary with home size and age, number of gas appliances, thermostat settings, insulation and weather.

Natural gas remains one of the most affordable heating sources for most customers in Indiana. In fact, CenterPoint natural gas customers in the utility's Indiana North territory who heated their homes with natural gas last year saved up to $920 compared to those who heated their homes with propane and up to $369 to $1,205 compared to those who heated with an electric heat pump or electric furnace, respectively.

CenterPoint Energy's Indiana North territory delivers natural gas to approximately 634,000 customers in Adams, Allen, Bartholomew, Blackford, Boone, Clark, Clay, Clinton, Decatur, Delaware, Fayette, Floyd, Fountain, Grant, Greene, Hamilton, Hancock, Hendricks, Henry, Huntington, Jackson, Jay, Jefferson, Johnson, Lawrence, Madison, Marion, Martin, Miami, Monroe, Montgomery, Morgan, Orange, Owen, Parke, Putnam, Randolph, Rush, Shelby, Tippecanoe, Tipton, Vermillion, Vigo, Wabash, Warren, Wayne, Wells and White counties.

CenterPoint Energy launches cold weather communications campaign to help customers address Energy Information Administration Forecast of increases in winter gas costs

DAYTON, Ohio - Oct. 15, 2025 - Today, as part of its commitment to supporting its customers in its Ohio natural gas service territory, CenterPoint Energy is launching a customer communication campaign encouraging eligible customers to take advantage of a series of support programs, including energy efficiency and bill assistance resources ahead of this winter heating season.

CenterPoint is taking action in response to nationwide industry forecasts, including the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) annual Winter Heating Outlook , that indicate that gas customers across the Midwest will see higher residential bills compared to last year, as a result of rising fuel costs. The campaign, which will include social media and direct outreach to customers, is aimed at helping customers plan and prepare for the potential impact of rising fuel costs nationwide.

While the agency anticipates stable year-over-year pricing nationally, the EIA projects higher gas prices in the Midwest due to higher expenditures.

""Given seasonal forecasts, including EIA's, of an increase to the cost of natural gas we are concerned about the potential for rising fuel prices to impact our customers' bills this winter. While CenterPoint doesn't control the price of natural gas or determine how fuel costs impact customer bills, we are committed to supporting our customers, especially those who may need help paying their energy bill. We encourage all those who may have difficulty paying their bill to plan ahead and take advantage of our customer support programs and energy-saving resources during the winter heating season,"" said Mike Roeder, CenterPoint's Senior Vice President, External Affairs.

Financial Assistance and Customer Support Programs

CenterPoint encourages customers to take advantage of payment assistance options and energy-saving programs to help manage their winter bills, including:

Choice Program: Through CenterPoint's natural gas Choice Program, customers can choose a natural gas supplier that's right for them. Competing suppliers offer more pricing options for consumers, such as locking in a fixed rate, which allows them to comparison shop for energy the way they do for other products and services. Customers who do not choose a third-party supplier are served by one of five default Standard Choice Offer suppliers at a variable rate. Visit CenterPointEnergy.com/Choice for a list of suppliers and up-to-date prices.

Home Energy Assistance Program (HEAP): State and federal utility assistance dollars are available for income-eligible customers. Households must fall at or below 175 percent of federal poverty guidelines to apply. Visit development.ohio.gov or call (800) 282-0880 to learn more.

HEAP Winter Crisis Program: The HEAP Winter Crisis Program provides assistance once per heating season to eligible households that are disconnected or are threatened with disconnection. Households must fall at or below 175 percent of federal poverty guidelines to apply. Visit development.ohio.gov or call (800) 282-0880 to learn more.

Percentage of Income Payment Plan Plus (PIPP Plus): PIPP Plus calls for a qualified household to pay 5 percent of its monthly income for gas service throughout the year. To be eligible for the PIPP Plus program, a customer must receive his or her primary or secondary heat source from a company regulated by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, must have a total household income which is at or below 175 percent of the federal poverty level and must apply for all energy assistance programs for which he or she is eligible.

Due Date Extension and Payment Arrangement: These are two free offerings available to customers in need of a special payment plan to temporarily keep their service connected and better manage energy costs.

Energy Efficiency Resources: CenterPoint offers energy efficiency tips and tools to help customers lower their natural gas usage. Visit CenterPointEnergy.com/SmartSavings or call 1-800-227-1376 for additional information.

Budget Bill: Under this billing plan, a customer's estimated costs for gas service are spread in equal amounts throughout the year. This leveling of monthly bill amounts reduces the need to pay the full amount in the winter and spreads some of those higher bill charges into the non-heating months. Customers can learn more and enroll for free at CenterPointEnergy.com or by calling 1-800-227-1376.

Home Weatherization Program: CenterPoint partners with Miami Valley Community Action Partnership to weatherize homes and helps qualifying Ohio customers implement energy efficiency improvements to their homes at no cost. Households must fall within 300 percent of federal poverty guidelines to apply. Visit miamivalleycap.org to learn more.

Additional details about these customer support programs can be found at CenterPointEnergy.com/ResourceHub or call us at 812-227-1376.

Summary of Key Facts

CenterPoint is not a natural gas supplier. The customer's natural gas supplier and corresponding price per unit of gas can significantly influence bill amounts. Customers can choose a fixed price that won't fluctuate over the winter months. Since natural gas represents nearly half of customers' bills during the winter months, now could be a good time for customers to explore supplier pricing options.

Industry forecasts, including the Energy Information Administration (EIA) annual Winter Heating Outlook point to higher residential bills this year compared to last.

The average CenterPoint customer paid $112 per month for natural gas service during the 2024-2025 heating season for a five-month total (November - March) of approximately $558. Actual bills vary with home size and age, number of gas appliances, thermostat settings, insulation and weather.

Natural gas continues to be one of the most affordable heating sources for most customers in Ohio. In fact, CenterPoint Ohio gas customers who heated their homes with natural gas last year saved up to $942 compared to those who heated their homes with propane and up to $324 to $2,418 compared to those who heated with an electric heat pump or electric furnace, respectively.

CenterPoint Energy's Ohio natural gas service territory delivers natural gas to approximately 330,000 customers in all or portions of Auglaize, Champaign, Clark, Clinton, Darke, Fayette, Greene, Highland, Logan, Madison, Miami, Montgomery, Pickaway, Preble, Shelby and Warren counties.

CLG Europe emphasized that regulatory stability will be essential to sustain the transformation already underway.
“There is tremendous support from businesses and investors for an effective Clean Industrial Deal,” said Ursula Woodburn , director of the organization.
According to European Commission calculations, achieving a 90% emissions reduction target would require doubling the annual rate of renewable energy installation , which stood at 56 GW in 2024 , and tripling the installed energy storage capacity by 2040.
However, companies agree that climate ambition can be an industrial advantage , provided it is accompanied by clear incentives, reduced red tape, and an industrial strategy aligned with the energy transition.","A group of 131 companies, investors and trade organisations urged the European Union to set a 90% emissions reduction target by 2040 , in order to offer a signal of political and economic commitment capable of restoring market confidence and accelerating investment in clean technologies .

The initiative, coordinated by Corporate Leaders Groups Europe (CLG Europe) , was formalized in a letter sent today to the EU institutions, on the eve of the meeting of European leaders in Brussels on October 23 and 24 , where the direction of industrial competitiveness and the future climate framework for the region will be discussed.

The signatory companies—which include players in the energy, technology, financial, manufacturing, and transportation sectors—request that the new legislative package incorporate three core elements:

a net 90% reduction in emissions by 2040 ,

a Clean Industrial Pact that simplifies green investments and eliminates bureaucratic barriers,

and the creation of leading markets with clear regulations, tax incentives, and strategic public procurement for low-carbon products.

CLG Europe emphasized that regulatory stability will be essential to sustain the transformation already underway.

“There is tremendous support from businesses and investors for an effective Clean Industrial Deal,” said Ursula Woodburn , director of the organization.

He explained that the world is experiencing an unprecedented technological revolution, and many companies have already invested in clean technologies in Europe, but “to ensure they reap the benefits of those investments, now is the time to turn intentions into actions that strengthen Europe’s industrial advantage.”

The private sector’s request comes amid an economic climate marked by slowing industrial growth in the eurozone and competitive pressure from the United States and China , which have deployed aggressive policies to attract green capital over the past two years.

The US Inflation Reduction Act , for example, offers more than $370 billion in tax credits and subsidies for manufacturing and clean energy, which has redirected some of the global investment previously directed to the European continent.

In this scenario, the EU is trying to shape a “Green Deal Industrial Plan” to offset the loss of attractiveness and accelerate the electrification of energy-intensive sectors such as steel, cement, and heavy transport.

For María Mendiluce , CEO of the We Mean Business Coalition , Europe still has time to consolidate its leadership: “The continent has a real opportunity to lead the next industrial transformation, driven by clean technologies that strengthen competitiveness, energy security, and long-term prosperity,” she noted.

However, he warned that this leadership “will not be maintained without a clear and substantive policy,” and therefore called for a coherent framework that offers certainty to investors and harmonizes regulation, finance, and innovation across the single market.

According to European Commission calculations, achieving a 90% emissions reduction target would require doubling the annual rate of renewable energy installation , which stood at 56 GW in 2024 , and tripling the installed energy storage capacity by 2040.

Furthermore, it would entail reducing demand for fossil fuels by 80% compared to current levels and an additional investment of €1.5 trillion in electrical infrastructure, smart grids, and local production of critical technologies such as batteries and electrolyzers.

The call’s proponents argue that companies are already mobilizing some of that capital: more than 1,000,000 jobs in Europe currently depend directly on the clean energy value chain, and that number is expected to double if a predictable investment environment is achieved.

In this sense, the proposed Clean Industrial Pact aims to ensure that these opportunities “are exploited on European soil and not relocated to regions with more attractive environments.”

Over the coming months, the proposal will be discussed in the European Parliament and the Council, where some Member States have already expressed reservations about the economic viability of the new target.

However, companies agree that climate ambition can be an industrial advantage , provided it is accompanied by clear incentives, reduced red tape, and an industrial strategy aligned with the energy transition.",https://strategicenergy.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Renovables-32-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 10:00:38.134218

This funding will be used to enhance around 5,000 miles of transmission lines across Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, and West Virginia.

The project involves replacing existing transmission lines with new ones capable of carrying more energy.

The upgrades are expected to provide enhanced reliability and facilitate new economic growth opportunities by increasing power capacity in the communities served by AEP.

The company estimates the creation of around 1,100 construction jobs through these upgrades.

Additionally, the project is anticipated to save customers around $275m in financing costs over the loan’s duration, resulting in reduced expenses reflected in their bills.

AEP said it is experiencing a surge in energy demand, with customers committing to expansions requiring an additional 24GW of electricity by the end of the decade.

The enhancements have been primarily aimed at supporting data centres, AI, and manufacturing advancements, signifying generational increase in the electric system’s load.

AEP is exploring federal funding and implementing rate structures to ensure that new large customers contribute to infrastructure investments.

This strategy aims to mitigate rate impacts on existing customers.

AEP chair, president, and CEO Bill Fehrman said: “AEP is experiencing growth in energy demand that has not been seen in a generation. As the first company to close a new loan with the Trump Administration under this programme, we are excited to get to work on these projects to improve the service we provide to our customers.

“This loan saves our customers money and improves reliability while supporting economic growth in our states. The funds we will save through this programme enable us to make additional investments to enhance service for our customers.”

Until now, we’ve been customers of utilities — with power flowing one way to homes — but more and more we’ll be active participants in the grid, sending extra battery power the other way.
“There’s more energy capacity deployed today in electric vehicle batteries on the road in the U.S. than in all stationary batteries combined,” Rauscher added.
At the same time, ever more data centers are devouring ever more power and stressing the grid to its limits.
“I fundamentally believe that bidirectional electric vehicles are going to be something that no one’s ever heard of, until suddenly everyone has it,” Rauscher said.","Depending on whom you’re asking, renewable energy and electric vehicles will either destroy the grid or save it. The sun doesn’t always shine and the wind doesn’t always blow, true enough, while a gas-fired power plant can generate electricity any time. That supposed precarity of renewables will get even shakier, critics argue, as Americans ditch conventional vehicles for electric ones, which will draw ever more power from an already strained grid.

Luckily, that’s not a realistic scenario because of what renewables and EVs have in common: giant batteries. Solar and wind farms are plugging into huge banks of them to store energy to use as needed, fixing their intermittency challenge. (Engineers are turning Earth itself into an even bigger battery.) And a growing number of cars with cords feature vehicle-to-grid technology, or V2G, also known as bidirectional charging. They can draw clean power when renewables are humming on the grid, and their owners get paid to send some back to a utility to meet growing demand — creating a vast distributed network that could make the electrical system more reliable, not less. Research has found that globally, less than a third of EV owners would have to opt into such a system to meet the rising need for energy storage.

Until now, we’ve been customers of utilities — with power flowing one way to homes — but more and more we’ll be active participants in the grid, sending extra battery power the other way. That shift is getting a head start in Maryland, where last month the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company partnered with Sunrun, which provides home solar and batteries, and Ford, which makes the electric F-150 Lightning, to activate the nation’s first residential V2G pilot project.

“This is the first time there are actual customers who are off-boarding power from their electric vehicles to the grid, and we’re doing it at peak times in the evening,” said Chris Rauscher, vice president of grid services at Sunrun, referring to the periods of greatest need for electricity. “So we’re actually reducing the stress and the demand on the grid — crushing the curve, crushing the peak — which helps lower costs for everyone.”

To understand how this works, think of EVs less like vehicles, and more like immense batteries on wheels. In fact, the Lightning’s battery is 10 times bigger than a residential pack, Rauscher said. “There’s more energy capacity deployed today in electric vehicle batteries on the road in the U.S. than in all stationary batteries combined,” Rauscher added. “This is a massive resource.” And it’s only getting more massive: The Natural Resources Defense Council has estimated that if California V2G’ed all of the 14 million EVs it’s expected to have by 2035, they could power every home in the state for three days.

In these early days of the tech, though, only a handful of models sport V2G capabilities, but the number is growing. The hardware and software aren’t wildly complicated. A special charger juices up the vehicle’s battery, then draws from the car to power a house, in the case of vehicle-to-home systems, or sends it back to the utility, in the case of vehicle-to-grid.

Utilities will have to communicate with anyone participating in such a program, for instance with an app that allows a customer to, say, ask that their vehicle never be discharged below a certain percentage. Each utility will also need to figure out how much to compensate people for their power in order to incentivize them to join in. That might mean paying for the amount of energy provided, the same principle behind net metering, in which residential solar customers are reimbursed for the energy they give to the grid. “We’re still in a bit of an early stage here,” said Divesh Gupta, director of clean energy solutions at Baltimore Gas and Electric Company. “There are a lot of things that need to be worked out, particularly on the customer experience side.”

That battery power need not go all the way back to the grid, though, to help utilities. For years now, owners have been using their Ford Lightning trucks to power their homes. These batteries are mammoth — the extended-range version can go 300-plus miles — and powering a home with one uses just five or six miles of that range per hour.

So say an owner returns home at 6 pm, when demand on the grid is skyrocketing as everyone else is knocking off work and switching on air conditioners and other energy-hungry appliances. Because consumption is rising, so too is the price of electricity. But a Lightning owner doesn’t have to pay that if they’re using their battery to power their home for five hours until they go to bed, using 25 to 30 miles of range on their battery. “It basically makes the house disappear, effectively, from the grid,” said Ryan O’Gorman, Ford’s business lead for vehicle-to-grid and vehicle-to-home.

Then the owner can charge again when demand, and electricity prices, are lower. If they work from home, for example, they can charge during the day, when lots of solar power is coursing through the grid.

More homes tapping EV batteries also eases demand on the grid, which is especially welcome during a heat wave when everyone’s running their AC units. Those heat waves will only get worse from here — a growing challenge for utilities to provide the power that keeps people cool and safe. At the same time, ever more data centers are devouring ever more power and stressing the grid to its limits. That infrastructure also must accommodate other forms of decarbonization, like heat pumps and induction stoves, that are essential for weaning us off fossil fuels.

Instead of sitting idly in a garage depreciating, V2G turns an EV into an asset for bolstering the grid and powering the home cheaply. “Cars are parked more than 22 hours a day,” O’Gorman said. “When we look at the advantages of an EV, now that vehicle can provide savings and potentially revenue flows for the customer.” (Interestingly, even electric trains can now send juice back to the grid and generate revenue, thanks to what they gain from regenerative braking: In the Bay Area, the Caltrain system is now being compensated for that energy, slashing its estimated annual power cost from $19.5 million to $16.5 million.)

The residential V2G program in Baltimore follows other experiments across the nation with larger vehicles. In Oakland, California, for instance, the utility Pacific Gas and Electric worked with the electric bus provider Zum to deploy vehicles that take kids home in the afternoon, return to the lot, and plug back into the grid. Because their batteries are so large, they have ample power left over, sending that extra energy to the grid just as demand is spiking. They charge overnight, take kids to school, and plug in again to charge.

This kind of predictability could make commercial fleets even more powerful for V2G than residential vehicles, experts say. A school bus is on a schedule a utility can rely on — it’s parked and available at certain times of day, and making the rounds at others. Plus, in the summer, they would be available almost constantly. Other fleets, like delivery and government vehicles, follow regular timetables as well.

Fleet managers can also procure large numbers of the appropriate chargers, buying into the system en masse, compared to a homeowner shelling out for just one. “In the short term, we see commercial-level V2G applications as more viable due to infrastructure costs, but we expect affordable domestic units to emerge as the market matures and demand grows,” said a spokesperson for Nissan, which has long included bidirectional charging in its electric Leaf.

Utilities are still figuring out how to coordinate this ballet between vehicle, charger, and grid on a citywide scale. But the payoff could be big, because all those EVs are existing infrastructure that could help reduce the need to build dedicated battery plants to store renewable energy. The less a utility has to build, the fewer costs it has to pass on to ratepayers. And with more V2G, a utility that has to import lots of electricity from a neighboring state can now store power locally.

Thus this technology could reduce energy bills. And for participants, their vehicles now provide transportation and energy storage. “It would seem pretty easy to imagine that that’s going to be cheaper than building just stationary battery storage facilities that do nothing but support the grid in times of need,” said Rudi Halbright, product manager of VGI pilot implementation at Pacific Gas and Electric. “Because you’re not getting that secondary use with those batteries. They’re kind of sitting around a lot of the time.”

People are more complicated than battery banks, though. Folks with busy lives want the convenience of charging their cars whenever they like, and might not even realize how much prices fluctuate throughout the day, said David Victor, a professor at the University of California, San Diego, who studies the behavior of EV drivers. Many like the peace of mind of having a fully charged vehicle ready at all times. “I take from that that V2G is going to be really, really hard for fleets outside of professionally managed fleets,” Victor said, “that we know reliably are going to be available at the time that the V2G asset is going to be needed.”

Still, given the number of EVs out there, only a fraction of owners need to participate to make a sizable impact. And residential and commercial V2G can complement each other — and in turn, complement a utility’s larger battery facilities — a widescale diversification of energy storage that could accelerate the adoption of renewables. “I fundamentally believe that bidirectional electric vehicles are going to be something that no one’s ever heard of, until suddenly everyone has it,” Rauscher said. “Once we have enough customers enrolled and deployed out there, some percent of customers not plugging in and performing doesn’t really matter.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/evs.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-10-17 07:58:12.014165

North American export capacity additions will total over 50% of expected global additions through 2029, according to the International Energy Agency.

USA

The planned liquefaction capacity additions will be concentrated around the US Gulf Coast, already the largest hub for LNG exports in the Atlantic Basin. To supply these terminals, new pipeline projects will be built to transport natural gas from production areas. However, pipeline construction delays remain a supply risk for new terminals. Plaquemines LNG Phase 1 shipped its first cargo in December 2024. Plaquemines LNG Phase 2 and Corpus Christi Stage III began shipping cargoes earlier in 2025, but they have not yet begun commercial operation. Five additional LNG export projects in the US have reached final investment decision (FID) and are currently under construction:

Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 (1.6 billion ft3/d).

Rio Grande LNG (2.1 billion ft3/d).

Woodside Louisiana LNG (2.2 billion ft3/d).

Golden Pass LNG (2.1 billion ft3/d).

CP2 Phase 1 (2.0 billion ft3/d).

Canada

On 1 July 2025, LNG Canada – the nation’s first LNG export terminal – shipped its first cargo from Train 1 after achieving first LNG production in late June. LNG Canada, located in British Columbia, can produce a combined 1.84 billion ft3/d from two liquefaction trains (0.9 billion ft3/d per train), and the facility is anticipated to reach full capacity in 2026. A proposed second phase of the project would double the export capacity to 3.68 billion ft3/d and expand the facility to four trains, according to the Canada Energy Regulator (CER). The expansion is expected to come online after 2029.

Canada’s new LNG capacity will be on the west coast of North America, reducing shipping times to Asian markets by 50% compared with exports from US Gulf Coast terminals, and will source feedgas from the Montney Formation in the western provinces of Alberta and British Columbia. Two other projects with a combined capacity of 0.7 billion ft3/d are currently under construction in Western Canada. Woodfibre LNG, with an export capacity of 0.3 billion ft3/d, is expected to start LNG exports in 2027. Cedar LNG – a floating LNG project with capacity to liquefy up to 0.4 billion ft3/d – reached FID in June 2024 and is expected to begin LNG exports in 2028.

Mexico

Developers are currently constructing two LNG export projects in Mexico with a combined capacity of 0.6 billion ft3/d – the Fast LNG Altamira floating LNG (FLNG) production vessel (FLNG2), which has a capacity to liquefy up to 0.2 billion ft3/d off the east coast of Mexico, and Energía Costa Azul (0.4 billion ft3/d export capacity) on Mexico's west coast.

Stellantis says the investments will expands its U.S. production footprint by 50 percent, with the program including five new vehicle Launches and 19 what it calls “product actions” that will add some 5,000 new jobs increase output at assembly plants in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan and Indiana.

Automotive assembly plants typically are served by numerous nearby component makers, including metals stamping and machining plants that produce significant flows of recyclable metal. The network of factories also generates steady streams of old corrugated containers (OCC) and plastic film scrap.

Stellantis calls the $13 billion program its largest single investment in the 100-year history of the company and its predecessor firms and brands, which include Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Ram.

The four plants directly benefiting from the program are assembly facilities in Belvidere, Illinois; Kokomo, Indiana; Warren, Michigan; and Toledo, Ohio.

“This investment in the U.S., the single largest in the company’s history, will drive our growth, strengthen our manufacturing footprint and bring more American jobs to the states we call home,” says Antonio Filosa, Stellantis CEO and North America chief operating officer.

“Accelerating growth in the U.S. has been a top priority since my first day,” says Filosa. “Success in America is not just good for Stellantis in the U.S.: it makes us stronger everywhere.”

When calculating the $13 billion investment price tag, Stellantis says it included research and development and supplier costs necessary to “execute the company’s full product strategy over the next four years,” as well as direct investments in its manufacturing operations.

The company provided the following breakdown of investments in the four locations.

In Illinois, Stellantis says it intends to invest more than $600 million to reopen the Belvidere Assembly Plant and expand production of the Jeep Cherokee and Jeep Compass for the U.S. market, with the plant’s relaunch expected in 2027 in a move anticipated to create around 3,300 new jobs.

The announcement about the Compass has not been well received in Canada, since production of that vehicle had been planned to take place in Brompton, Ontario.

According to AP News, the move has been noted by Canadian Prime Minister James Carney and Ontario Premier Doug Ford as tied to tariffs imposed by the administration of Donald J. Trump on goods manufactured in Canada.

AP quotes Canadian Industry Minister Mélanie Joly as saying the production shift violates existing agreements between Stellantis and government agencies in Canada. “Anything short of fulfilling that commitment will be considered as default under our agreements,"" Joly reportedly writes in a letter to Stellantis CEO Filosa.

In Ohio, an investment of nearly $400 million will result in the assembly of an all-new midsize truck (previously allocated to the Belvidere plant) at the Toledo Assembly Complex, where the new model will join the Jeep Wrangler and Jeep Gladiator as output. The production shift could create more than 900 jobs, with that launch expected in 2028.

In Michigan, Stellantis says it plans to develop an all-new range-extended electric vehicle (EV) and internal combustion engine large sport utility vehicle (SUV) that will be produced at the Warren Truck Assembly Plant beginning in 2028. The company says it will invest nearly $100 million to retool the facility and add more than 900 jobs there.

She said she attended the safety symposium in order to better understand the energy storage industry at large, as well as potential opportunities within it.

“This way, we’re getting more and more information out to people, especially about this really important topic of battery safety,” she said.","Energy storage experts from organizations such as the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the New York State Office of Fire Prevention and Control gathered Thursday at Binghamton University to discuss the future of American-based battery innovation and safety.

Today, batteries power some of the most important aspects of our lives — from mobile phones and laptops to medical devices. As progress continues to be made in adopting clean technology, battery safety and reliability is a major priority.

The Battery Safety Symposium, held as part of Battery Week events organized by New Energy New York, brought together industry leaders to highlight developments in the sector, discuss potential challenges and solutions, and raise awareness of the best practices when it comes to operating batteries. Around 100 people registered for the symposium.

“It’s exciting to be a leader in not just the manufacturing and development of lithium batteries, but also to be a leader in helping people understand how they work and how to maintain them safely,” Binghamton University President Harvey Stenger said. “Today’s focus is on fire safety, related to batteries for large storage systems, and we have some of the world’s experts talking to a large group of people who want to understand what the safety issues we have to worry about for lithium batteries are, and how we manage them.”

Three Binghamton-led initiatives — New Energy New York, the NENY Tech Hub and the NSF Energy Storage Engine in Upstate New York — work together across multiple sectors to bolster U.S. leadership and competitiveness in energy storage.

“When you think about cars, you think of Detroit. We want that in the future,” said Ziang “John” Zhang, associate professor of electrical and computer engineering and workshop organizer. “When people think about batteries, they think of Binghamton and upstate New York’s ecosystem. That’s our goal.”

Attendees on Thursday learned about ways in which New York’s fire department is updating its fire safety codes in response to the increasing deployment of batteries. They also heard statistics on battery-related emergencies and how to prevent them.

“Dealing with battery emergencies in the fire service has been a passion of mine now for a couple years, and a lot of it has to do with the fact that I realized a lot of the firefighters across New York state didn’t have any knowledge on what to do with this,” said Victor Graves, a fire protection specialist with the NYS Office of Fire Prevention and Control. “The goal with this [workshop] is to make sure that they have the knowledge and they don’t get hurt.”

The workshop also brought in companies such as Viridi and Intertek, which are working to strengthen grid resiliency and test new technology to ensure safety, respectively. Speakers also detailed energy-storage related projects, including the MTA’s initiative to bring electric, zero-emission buses to New York City.

As a joint effort of the S3IP Center of Excellence, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Binghamton University’s Electrical and Computer Engineering Department and New Energy New York, the symposium was open not just to engineers and academics, but also to anyone who was interested in learning more about the industry, including students.

Binghamton senior Ashley Reed is a member of the student-run Binghamton Venture Fund, which offers real-world practice when it comes to investing in early-stage, private companies. She said she attended the safety symposium in order to better understand the energy storage industry at large, as well as potential opportunities within it.

“If there’s a strong need for battery storage, or the safety systems beyond it, that’s something we might look more into,” she said. “Just becoming more enlightened about the industry itself was interesting, because I’ve always heard about some of these problems just from the news — but being able to hear firsthand from the fire department and getting additional insights was all very interesting.”

The day also included live demonstrations of Viridi’s new energy storage system, as well as the opportunity to view a student-made electric racing car by Binghamton Motorsports. Attendees could also explore different modes of manufacturing through the SUNY Schenectady Mobile Learning Lab.

Indranil Bhattacharya, chair of Binghamton University’s Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, closed the day by highlighting faculty research in clean energy and opportunities for potential collaborations.

As Binghamton University remains a nexus between academia and industry to boost battery production in upstate New York, S3IP Project Staff Associate Caroline Pasquale said including safety in the discussion is critical.

“It’s very important that we continue to talk about it, especially with the initiatives that we have going on with NENY, the Tech Hub and the NSF Energy Storage Engine. They all blend together, and everybody’s working toward the same goal of battery manufacturing here in New York state,” she said. “Along with that, a huge component of that is battery safety.”

As school districts, fire stations and transportation authorities adopt clean energy storage, Pasquale hopes to keep offering opportunities for stakeholders from all corners of industry to get together and raise awareness on how to do it correctly and responsibly.

“This way, we’re getting more and more information out to people, especially about this really important topic of battery safety,” she said. “It’s only going to keep getting bigger.”",https://www.binghamton.edu/news/images/uploads/features/_normal/NENY_Battery-Week-Day-4_ZS20251016_JPEG-7.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 07:58:21.306792

Electric vehicle sales just hit an all-time high in the U.S. — but don’t expect the boom to last long.

For every 10 cars that automakers sold from July through September, one was an EV, according to fresh data from Cox Automotive. In other words, nearly 440,000 new battery-powered vehicles hit the nation’s roads during the third quarter of 2025. The previous single-quarter record, set in the final three months of last year, isn’t even in the same ballpark.

But the sales surge has a catch. Buyers flocked to EVs last quarter because it was their final opportunity to take advantage of a $7,500 federal tax credit that disappeared at the end of September under President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The incentive was previously slated to last until 2033.

Under these conditions, ​“the all-time sales and share records in Q3 were all but certain,” Cox wrote in a blog post accompanying the data. This quarter, by contrast, the company expects EV sales to ​“drop notably.”

Still, the U.S. electric vehicle market isn’t dead in the water without the tax credit. Already, automakers that have invested huge sums in the EV transition are making changes to try and keep sales going in America. Hyundai, for example, announced in early October that it will cut the price of its popular Ioniq 5 EV by nearly $10,000 next year. One week later, General Motors unveiled a $29,000 version of its Chevy Bolt.

Some state and local governments are taking action, too: Colorado boosted the discounts it offers for both new and used EVs. Burlington, Vermont, launched a similar program.

Meanwhile, the country’s public EV charging network is growing steadily, and the Trump administration is moving ahead with a $5 billion Biden-era program to build out charging infrastructure.

It’s clear, as Cox points out, that electrified vehicles are the future of transportation. Indeed, some countries are already living in that era: In Norway, more than eight in 10 new cars sold are fully electric. The roadblocks set up by the Trump administration might delay progress in the U.S., but it can’t stave off the inevitable.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/COTW-ev-boom.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=80&w=1200&s=4a78508e8513a6e17a2e7f1dc2ac623f,N,,2025-10-17 09:00:33.730187

The Energy Department said at the time it was “not critical for the federal government to have a role” in the first phase of the $11 billion project planned by Chicago-based Invenergy.","By MATTHEW DALY, Associated Press

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Department of Energy said Thursday it has finalized a $1.6 billion loan guarantee to a subsidiary of one of the nation’s largest power companies to upgrade nearly 5,000 miles of transmission lines across five states, mostly in the Midwest, for largely fossil fuel-run energy.

AEP Transmission will upgrade power lines in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia to enhance enhance grid reliability and capacity, the Energy Department said. The project is meant to help meet surging electricity demand from data centers and artificial intelligence.

Ohio-based American Electric Power, which owns AEP Transmission, is one of the nation’s largest utilities, serving 5.6 million customers in 11 states. It primarily produces electricity from coal, natural gas and nuclear power, along with renewable resources such as wind and hydroelectric power.

Thursday’s announcement deepens the Trump administration’s commitment to traditional, polluting energy sources even as it works to discourage the U.S. from clean energy use.

Earlier this month, the administration cancelled $7.6 billion in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election. A total of 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable, the Energy Department said.

The cancellations include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub aimed at developing clean-burning hydrogen fuels to power ships and heavy-duty trucks. A hydrogen project costing up to $1 billion in the Pacific Northwest also was cancelled.

The loan guarantee finalized Thursday is the first offered by the Trump administration under the recently renamed Energy Dominance Financing program created by the massive tax-and-spending law approved this summer by congressional Republicans and signed by President Donald Trump. Electric utilities that receive loans through the program must provide assurances to the government that financial benefits from the financing will be passed on to customers, the Energy Department said.

The project and others being considered will help ensure that Americans “will have access to affordable, reliable and secure energy for decades to come,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement.

“The president has been clear: America must reverse course from the energy subtraction agenda of past administrations and strengthen our electrical grid,” Wright said, adding that modernizing the grid and expanding transmission capacity “will help position the United States to win the AI race and grow our manufacturing base.”

The upgrades supported by the federal financing will replace existing transmission lines in existing rights-of-way with new lines capable of carrying more energy, the power company said.

More than 2,000 miles of transmission lines in Ohio serving 1.5 million people will be replaced, along with more than 1,400 miles in Indiana and Michigan serving 600,000 customers, the company said. An additional 1,400 miles in Oklahoma, serving about 1.2 million people and 26 miles in West Virginia, serving 460,000 people, will be replaced.

The projects will create about 1,100 construction jobs, the company said.

The loan guarantee will save customers money and improve reliability while supporting economic growth in the five states, said Bill Fehrman, AEP’s chairman, president and chief executive officer. “The funds we will save through this program enable us to make additional investments to enhance service for our customers,” he added.

Wright, in a conference call with reporters, distinguished the AEP loan guarantee from a $4.9 billion federal loan guarantee the department cancelled in July. That money would have boosted the planned Grain Belt Express, a new high-voltage transmission line set to deliver solar and wind-generated electricity from the Midwest to eastern states.

The Energy Department said at the time it was “not critical for the federal government to have a role” in the first phase of the $11 billion project planned by Chicago-based Invenergy. The department also questioned whether the project could meet strict financial conditions required, a claim Wright repeated Thursday.

“Ultimately that is a commercial enterprise that needs private developers,” Wright said. The company has indicated the Grain Belt project will go forward.

Trump and Wright have repeatedly derided wind and solar energy as unreliable and opposed efforts to combat climate change by moving away from fossil fuels. Wright said the Grain Belt Express loan was among billions of dollars worth of commitments “rushed out the doors” in the waning days of former President Joe Biden’s administration.",https://www.thenewsherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Trump_Argentina_40595.jpg?w=1024&h=682,N,,2025-10-17 14:11:20.278383

The lawsuit, filed Thursday in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, accuses the Environmental Protection Agency of breaching grant agreements by unilaterally terminated grants that had already been awarded.

""The administration is again targeting people struggling to get by in America, this time by gutting programs that help low-income households afford electricity, Washington State Attorney General Nick Brown said in a statement.

""Congress passed a solar energy program to help make electricity costs more affordable, but the administration is ignoring the law and focused on the conspiracy theory that climate change is a hoax.

The Solar for All program was established with the passage of the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, which included a $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund for the EPA to administer.

Using that Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, Congress appropriated $7 billion for the EPA to make grants, loans and financial assistance available for low-income and disadvantaged communities to benefit from zero-emission technologies, including solar power.

In April 2024, the EPA announced it had selected 60 applicants to receive the grants. By August of that year, the EPA had awarded program funds to states and other grant recipients.

But in August, the EPA, under the Trump administration, ended the program and reclaimed about 90% of the funds already awarded.

The 22 states, along with the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation, are accusing the Trump administration of violating the Administrative Procedure Act, which governs how administrative agencies operate, and the Constitution's separation of powers doctrine by canceling the program.

The plaintiffs allege that the EPA is using an ""erroneous interpretation"" of H.R. 1, which the Trump administration calls the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed by Congress in July, to justify the termination of the grants.

The states on Wednesday also filed a complaint in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims to recover damages caused by the alleged breach of the grant agreements.",https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/2701760681541/2025/1/899162a62fb79ec2dfbf16b9510c72e4/v1.5/22-states-sue-EPA-over-canceled-7B-in-low-income-solar-grants.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 12:14:58.336585

Last week, a judge from Louisiana’s 38th Judicial District Court effectively halted construction of Commonwealth LNG by ordering state regulators to analyze the facility's climate change and environmental justice-related impacts, in conjunction with the broader LNG buildout in southwest Louisiana's Cameron Parish.

Three of the nation’s eight existing LNG export terminals are located in Cameron Parish, and several more are proposed or under construction there.

Louisiana’s attorney general vowed to appeal the ruling, which vacated the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy's coastal use permit for the facility.

“This is the first time any court has vacated a permit for an LNG facility based on the government’s refusal to consider climate change impacts,” said Clay Garside, an attorney representing the Sierra Club and other environmental groups.

Earlier this year, Trump reversed a Biden-era pause on exports of liquefied natural gas, or LNG, as part of his goal to boost natural gas exports and promote “energy dominance.”

Last year, the Biden administration's Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm’s had warned that “unfettered exports” of liquefied natural gas would increase planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions — a statement reflecting the findings of a Department of Energy report released in December.

Trump-appointed Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a fossil fuel executive, has moved to fast-track the buildout of LNG facilities, including Commonwealth LNG, which received an export authorization within weeks of Trump's inauguration.

“Cameron Parish is ground zero for the relentless expansion of the gas export industry,” said Anne Rolfes, founder of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, an environmental group involved in the litigation. “We’re going to stop it and this is an important step in that process.”

Lyle Hanna, a Commonwealth LNG spokesperson, said that “we are disappointed with the District Court’s decision, and we are exploring all available legal options.”

A spokesperson for the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy declined to comment, citing the potential of pending litigation. Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said that the state planned to appeal.

“Sadly even state court judges are not immune from climate activism,” Murrill said.

Last year, a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., had ordered the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to reassess Commonwealth LNG's air pollution, including its greenhouse gas emissions. In June, the commission gave the project a greenlight on the grounds that its construction was in the public interest.

In regulatory filings, the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy said that “climate change is currently beyond the scope"" of the state's regulatory review.

But District Judge Penelope Richard rejected this position, saying state environmental regulators have a duty to consider how the LNG facility, along with others clustered nearby, would impact extreme weather events, storm severity and sea-level rise in a state where a football field-worth of land disappears every 100 minutes.

Richard also ordered state regulators to analyze the facility's impacts on local communities, especially those living in poverty or relying on fishing for their livelihoods — which she noted was the “defining characteristic” of the parish. While the facility could destroy marshes, harm water quality and displace residents, the judge wrote, “none of it was considered in terms of impacts on environmental justice communities.""

Commercial fisherman Eddie LeJuine, a lifelong Cameron Parish resident, applauded the ruling. He said the buildout of LNG infrastructure, including dredging for shipping channels, has significantly harmed the fishing industry.

“The fishermen are barely hanging on with a thread,” LeJuine said. ""These plants are killing the estuary and killing our livelihoods. We’re getting extinct.”

In August, a dredging channel being developed by LNG firm Venture Global leaked into a nearby estuary. Local fishermen like LeJuine say the onslaught of saltwater and sediment will kill off large amounts of oyster, crab and fish.

Venture Global, which is in the process of constructing a second LNG export terminal in the parish, said it is “committed to conservation"" and is working with state regulators and the community to respond to the incident.

The Village of Germantown Plan Commission on Monday voted against a proposal from Seattle-based OneEnergy Development for a solar energy facility at N144 W12531 Pioneer Road. The developer sought a conditional use permit, which will go to the Village Board on Nov. 3 with an unfavorable mark from the commission.

The proposed facility will have solar modules and collection equipment that will deliver power to the grid serving local We Energies customers, plans showed. The facility will have capacity of six megawatts, capable of serving 1,400 households. The project calls for solar modules mounted on single-axis racking, around 24 inverters to convert electricity for distribution, and transformers.

Robert Overmier owns the land and is working with OneEnergy to create the solar field, located on a larger 57-acre parcel. The property is currently farmland.

However, their proposal met opposition from at least a dozen residents, TMJ4 reported. Some said they were against the loss of farmland and others said they didn’t like how the proposed site looked.

Dubbed “Lime Kiln Solar,” the project will have a lifespan of 30-50 years and will use around 30 union workers at the height of construction, project plans showed.

“Our approach to solar development, engineering, and construction is low-impact and dual use,” OneEnergy officials wrote.

Officials said the area beneath and around the panels will be planted with a perennial pollinator mix to improve runoff and erosion control and enhance soil fertility over the lifetime of the project. The field will also have 8-foot fences to exclude deer, like ones used around an orchard. The area around the project will continue to be farmed, they added.

If the project gets final approval, construction is expected to take four to six months and will be completed in 2026 or 2027, depending on permitting and approvals.

The discussion will explore policy and investment strategies that safeguard U.S. manufacturing, reward clean production, and support fair competition in global markets. By combining innovation with strong domestic investment, Plug is proving that the U.S. can compete head-to-head with China, not through subsidies, but through productivity, reliability, and clean-energy excellence.

Marsh, said:

America’s energy advantage is its competitive edge,

“By turning that power into hydrogen and liquid fuels here at home, we can out-innovate global competitors, secure supply chains, and build a stronger, cleaner economy. I want to thank Senator Cassidy for his leadership in advancing policies that protect U.S. manufacturers and reward environmental accountability.”

Plug has identified Louisiana as a strategic hub for its expanding hydrogen network. Earlier this year, Plug and Olin Corporation launched Hidrogenii, a 15-ton-per-day liquid hydrogen joint venture in St. Gabriel, one of the Gulf Coast’s first large-scale hydrogen plants. The facility anchors Plug’s vertically integrated hydrogen ecosystem, serving industrial and mobility customers across the Southeast and Gulf regions.

Marsh’s participation underscores Plug’s leadership in building a resilient U.S. hydrogen economy, driving domestic manufacturing, and supporting smart policy measures, such as Senator Cassidy’s Foreign Pollution Fee Act, that create a level playing field for clean, efficient American producers.

General FAQs

Do I need permit coverage?

It is the responsibility of the operator to determine if permit coverage is required. Operators are required to obtain NPDES coverage if stormwater from the activity has the potential to enter a surface water of the state or a municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4).

Most sites have the potential to discharge stormwater. Even sites with stormwater treatment may discharge stormwater offsite. Many stormwater systems are designed to retain a specific quantity of stormwater based on rain events and local conditions, and to discharge any stormwater received over the design capacity. If the system discharges or overflows offsite, that is considered a discharge to an MS4 or water of the state.

Can I transfer permit coverage to a new operator when a facility/site changes hands?

NPDES stormwater permits are nontransferable. Coverage is given to the operator who conducts regulated activities. The responsible authority is liable for all activities indicated on the NOI.

If the operator of a site changes, due to ownership or contractor changes, etc., the new operator is responsible for submitting a Notice of Intent with processing fee to obtain permit coverage. The prior operator is responsible for submitting a Notice of Termination.

Applying for Coverage

How do I obtain permit coverage?

The operator must submit a Notice of Intent and processing fee for the NPDES Stormwater Generic Permit.

NOIs cannot be processed via email, as they do not meet federal CROMERR signatory requirements.

NOIs can be submitted through the Business Portal with PIN Guidance and CGP Guidance or MSGP Guidance. If NOIs cannot be submitted through the Business Portal, they must be mailed or faxed. Mail the NOI and processing fee to:

Florida Department of Environmental Protection

PO Box 3070

Tallahassee, FL 32315

Applications cannot be processed without payment. If an NOI is submitted without the processing fee, the department will send an invoice. Invoices can be paid online through the Business Portal. An application is considered incomplete if the fee has not been received or if the NOI is missing information. An incomplete NOI must be corrected to be considered complete. In this case, you will receive a Requests for Additional Information (RAI) via email.

How do I pay the processing fee?

If you are submitting a paper NOI, a check or money order should be made payable to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. You may also submit a paper NOI and pay online through the DEP Business Portal once application has been processed and you receive a facility ID number. Visa or MasterCard are accepted.

** Note: other state of Florida agencies may pay through a Journal Transfer. **

When is my permit coverage effective?

Permit coverage for construction and industrial activities is effective two days after date DEP receives your complete NOI and processing fee.

Note: the acknowledgement may be sent after the effective date of coverage.

How do I renew coverage for my NPDES Stormwater GP?

Coverage under an NPDES Stormwater GP is effective for a period of five years. To renew coverage, the facility must ensure the Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) has been updated to reflect conditions currently occurring at the facility and submit a new Notice of Intent and processing fee.

Filling out the NOI

Who can submit the NOI?

The operator of the regulated activity is responsible for submitting an NOI and maintaining compliance with the permit. The NOI must be signed by the responsible authority.

The “operator” is the entity (business, company, etc.) that operates the activity/project and has sufficient authority to ensure compliance with the permit. Typically, the operator is the developer or construction general contractor. Generally, the architect/engineer or project manager should not be indicated as the operator unless they have operational control over the project and are willing to accept responsibility for compliance with the CGP.

The “responsible authority” is the person who has authority to sign the NOI for the operator (Rule 62-620.305, F.A.C.), specifies who may sign permit applications. The person who signs the NOI assumes responsibility for permit compliance. For instance, the operator may be “The John Smith Development Company” and the responsible authority may be “John Smith, President.” In this case, John Smith would sign the NOI for the John Smith Development Company.

A site owner can choose to hold the permit should the owner decide to assume responsibility for ensuring that the operator is adhering conditions of the permit and the Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) on site.

Note: A registered agent does not meet the definition of “Responsible Authority.”

In the Business Portal, a preparer can fill out the NOI, but the NOI must be signed by the Responsible Authority.

What is my Operator Status?

P = Private

M = Public (other than federal or state)

S = State

F = Federal

What do I enter for “MS4 Operator Name” and “Receiving Water Name”?

If stormwater discharges to an MS4, indicate the name of the municipality, county or other public body that operates the MS4. For instance, Orange County MS4, Tampa MS4, FDOT District-4 MS4, etc. Note: the Business Portal lists those MS4s that are permitted by DEP; however, your site may discharge to another MS4.

If stormwater does not discharge to an MS4, but rather discharges to surface waters of the state, indicate the route and name of the first named waterbody that receives the discharge. For instance, unnamed ditch to Catfish Creek, Redfish Bay, Gar Slough, unnamed canal to Sunfish Pond, etc.

Map with nearby water bodies.

Checking my NOI Status

I sent my NOI several weeks ago, but have not heard anything back. Will I receive a reply?

Our goal is to process NOIs received via mail within two weeks. The Responsible Authority will receive an automated email once we begin processing the NOI. Once reviewed, permitting staff will send you a request for additional information or acknowledgement of coverage.

Generally, if the check has been deposited and not returned, we have received your application.

A spokesperson for the EPA declined to comment in a Thursday night email that noted it does not comment on pending litigation.

State of play: Congress appropriated funds for the Solar for All program during President Biden's administration in 2022 through the Inflation Reduction Act.

Companies and investment firms have found themselves recalibrating strategies and expectations based on new generation and storage technologies, significant changes in (often clashing) federal and state tax incentives and shifting overseas regulations and market trends. Driving both investment and the national energy conversation: power demand that is surging everywhere.

The energy investment landscape has been correspondingly unpredictable; the Trump administration has implemented policies discouraging investments in the fast-growing renewables industry, creating uncertainty by moving to eliminate clean energy tax credits, cancel wind and solar projects and reignite the coal industry. But the rapid growth in energy demand, from rising electrification as well as data centers, has entered the equation to keep the focus on renewables. As a result, investors are still bullish on renewables and optimism in private equity continues to climb.

Our panel on trends in energy investments discussed how the recent pullback on incentives for renewables has changed some calculations: Many investments originally made to take advantage of credits are going away. However, companies are proceeding with economically viable projects. With a huge amount of battery capacity set to come online, panelists predicted a cycle of M&A emerging for physical energy assets as well as continued growth in the tax credit market.

Solar projects look to dominate new energy capacity, though the momentum is beginning to decelerate after years of explosive growth. Investment in storage and gas is accelerating dramatically, while wind growth is slowing.

Among the themes this panel covered:

Perhaps counterintuitively, oil production increased during the Obama and Biden administrations. Part of the explanation: States have tended to create demand catalysts in response to federal incentives and regulations.

Fast-rising energy demand may weaken the current administration’s resistance to solar power. Don’t be surprised if federal policies and incentives shift as needs increase.

There’s a gap between conversation and generation, most notably with regard to nuclear power. There is a lot of discussion around this energy source, but its near-term impact on the national power supply will likely remain minor.

Many developers and investors are struggling to assess the evolving market for transferable clean energy credits, direct pay and new financing vehicles. The energy market has seen dramatic shifts over the past three years, as companies and investors deal with the ramifications of, first, the Inflation Reduction Act and, now, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Beyond the prediction that energy demand will continue growing rapidly, figuring out where the development market is going requires some soothsaying.

Our panel saw the market fully stratified by risk, with investors looking for backstops on companies’ balance sheets and new, sophisticated financing tools coming into play. An active tax credit investment market will be key, and analysts expect private capital to take an ever-larger role in projects.

Among the topics this panel covered:

Investment firms are struggling to gauge the tax credit market in the short and long term. The demand for tax credits has diminished since 2024, given favorable domestic tax changes decreasing appetite. But supply remains high and the market remains robust.

Recent Treasury guidance gave renewables developers until July 2026 to qualify for certain federal tax incentives, presenting a tight deadline for the end of the 5% safe harbor rule for wind and utility-scale solar energy projects. Developers need to develop a robust safe harbor strategy.

Robust FEOC (foreign entities of concern) rules may seriously affect the availability of battery and solar capacity, with major impacts on both development plans and investment and tax credits.

Sustainability News Brief

An unusual number of federal-level developments look to have an outsized impact on company leaders trying to anticipate the administration’s next move and stay ahead of potential problems. Our panel took a candid look at the legislative and regulatory landscape affecting the energy industry, focusing on shifting energy incentives and tariffs that may impact the costs and timelines of energy project development.

Tariffs are on everyone’s mind, particularly those affecting products at the heart of energy industry infrastructure, from solar panels to steel and aluminum. As panelists noted, no one is completely clear on the long-term impacts of the administration’s tariff strategy on prices, supply chains or anything else. Companies, many currently working to renegotiate the price of critical materials such as copper, will need to watch developments carefully.

The panel also discussed:

There is tension between the administration’s approach to solar and wind power and some Republican senators’ support for renewable energy that benefits their states. The US Treasury Department has had to strike a balance in developing guidance.

Legislation and regulation are increasingly incorporating complex FEOC rules, but some Republican senators are concerned that strict implementation would hold back development of even conventional energy infrastructure.

Corporate leaders should be open-minded about the changing tax policy landscape and about which legislators or policymakers might be willing to listen to concerns and work to change rules.

How to quantify sustainability factors in dealmaking | PwC Global

Translating the tax bill for business: How should executives prepare?

News headlines suggest that companies are scaling back their sustainability initiatives. A deeper look at available data suggests a slightly different story. PwC’s Second Annual State of Decarbonization Report shows that 37% of companies are increasing their climate ambitions while only 16% are getting less aggressive. What’s behind this? Demand for power is only rising, and the need to tap solar, wind and other low carbon sources is becoming a business imperative, particularly with climate-related volatility threatening business continuity and resilience.

But leaders face supply chain challenges, not least in building the infrastructure that makes clean energy use possible. New federal FEOC rules are prompting companies to increase scrutiny of their supply chains and enhance related data collection efforts. Financing renewable energy deals can involve a daunting number of stakeholders and, with tax credits at stake, it’s important to get the documentation right and socialize it with other parties, to prove vendors’ eligibility if necessary. The volume of required information and the tracking of that data for due diligence should only continue to grow, as other supply chain partners also strive for compliance.

Collecting, monitoring and analyzing data of sufficient granularity can be onerous. Our panelists suggested looking to the enormous amount of publicly available data on suppliers and business operations and leveraging AI-based capabilities to pull together information in useful form.

Our panel also discussed:

Circularity is increasingly important in some industries looking for a systemic approach that minimizes waste and maximizes resource efficiency. Companies that have figured out circularity are measurably reducing waste, recovering rare earth minerals and seeing significant cost benefits.

Given the new FEOC rules, companies will need to determine their material assistance cost ratio, or a project’s direct costs that come from inputs provided by a foreign entity. A manufacturer, for example, will need to bring together the tax function, legislative affairs and operations among other departments to compile the relevant data from vendors and suppliers.

Why companies should start to reconsider the business case for circularity

Navigating the energy credit landscape after H.R. 1

In the wake of the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), many corporate leaders paused major decisions on energy deals to sort through the ramifications of new compliance issues and dramatically shifted tax incentives. Some businesses have moved to reduce exposure to renewables, responding to shareholder calls to focus on core competencies. The landscape for tax credits was particularly hazy, and only now is clarity emerging.

Our panelists discussed the state of the tax credits market, including new financing vehicles and the impact on M&A in upcoming months. OBBBA and IRS Notice 2025-42, which eliminated the 5% safe harbor for most wind and solar facilities, have introduced new considerations around credits and have driven a reassessment of the state of renewable energy in the United States.

Analysts expect a round of energy deals in the next year, with more involving solar and storage and dramatically fewer involving wind. De-risked projects may have little trouble finding financing, but every contract will need provisions about diligence and material assistance, and companies don’t necessarily have those systems in place. Sellers will have the added burden of compliance with new FEOC rules, requiring close monitoring of supply chains in 2026 and beyond.

Among the topics this panel covered:

On FEOC, leaders are looking for further Treasury guidance as the tax credit marketplace becomes more competitive. Analysts expect guidance in the next month or two, in the form of a notice, months ahead of an official regulation. Shifting rules on the clean energy credits in sections 45X and 45Z are far more straightforward for companies to incorporate.

Surprisingly often, companies have little visibility into who owns their debt. With FEOC compliance rules, many are asking their lenders for attestation that they’re not foreign entities, which those lenders may be unprepared to provide. Organizations may currently lack the tax expertise — or the data — to confidently claim full compliance.

Some companies’ positive experience with tax credits is leading to an uptick in leaders expressing interest. Demand is increasing for safe, investment-grade insurance-backed credits. But the supply of those safe credits is limited, and at some point the financial margin could be too narrow to be worth the bureaucratic effort.

Data shows PHEVs emit just 19% less CO2 than petrol and diesel cars, an analysis by the non-profit advocacy group Transport and Environment found on Thursday.

“Real-world emissions are going up, while official emissions are going down,” said Sofía Navas Gohlke, a researcher at Transport and Environment and the co-author of the report.
Even when the cars were driven in electric mode, the analysis found that levels of pollution were well above official estimates.","Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) pump out nearly five times more planet-heating pollution than official figures show, a report has found.

The cars, which can run on electric batteries as well as combustion engines, have been promoted by European carmakers as a way to cover long distances in a single drive – unlike fully electric cars – while still reducing emissions.

Data shows PHEVs emit just 19% less CO2 than petrol and diesel cars, an analysis by the non-profit advocacy group Transport and Environment found on Thursday. Under laboratory tests, they were assumed to be 75% less polluting.

The researchers analysed data from the onboard fuel consumption meters of 800,000 cars registered in Europe between 2021 and 2023. They found real-world carbon dioxide emissions from PHEVs in 2023 were 4.9 times greater than those from standardised laboratory tests, having risen from being 3.5 times greater in 2021.

“Real-world emissions are going up, while official emissions are going down,” said Sofía Navas Gohlke, a researcher at Transport and Environment and the co-author of the report. “This is the gap that is getting worse and it is a real problem. As a result, PHEVs pollute almost as much as petrol cars.”

The researchers attributed most of the gap to overestimates of the “utility factor” – the ratio of miles travelled in electric mode to the total miles travelled – finding that 27% of driving was done in electric mode even though official estimates assumed 84%. The European Commission has announced two corrections to the utility factor ratio that will narrow the gap but not close it entirely, according to the analysis.

Even when the cars were driven in electric mode, the analysis found that levels of pollution were well above official estimates. The researchers said this was because electric motors were not strong enough to operate alone, with their engines burning fossil fuels for almost one-third of the distance travelled in electric mode.

Patrick Plötz, head of energy economics at the Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research, who was not involved in the study, said it was a “very useful contribution” after years in which parts of the automotive industry argued there was too little data to accurately assess real-world emissions.

“The results demonstrate, beyond any doubt, that the gap between official and real-world PHEV fuel consumption and CO2 emissions is much, much larger than for gasoline or diesel cars,” said Plötz, who has published research on the topic. “Any policy changes with respect to PHEVs should be made with utmost care and in the light of that data.”

Hybrid cars have been drawn back into the political debate as carmakers have pressed the EU to weaken CO2 targets. A ban on new combustion engine cars in 2035 has been subject to heavy lobbying from the automotive industry and opposition from member states with large car industries.

“There must not be a drastic cut in 2035,” the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said after a summit last week with the country’s struggling automobile industry, promising to do “everything in [his] power” to achieve that. Other senior German politicians have floated plug-in hybrids as one example of possible “flexibilities” they could introduce to the legislation.

The researchers calculated that the underestimate of PHEV emissions had let four major carmaker groups avoid more than €5bn (£4.3bn) in fines between 2021 and 2023, by making it artificially easier to comply with the EU’s fleet-average CO2 targets. They added that drivers of PHEVs would also be paying about €500 more a year in running costs than would be assumed under laboratory tests.

“The bold claims that manufacturers like to make about their plug-in hybrid vehicles are clearly way off the mark,” said Colin Walker, a transport analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2c2db07dea96b8ac0349b221f3ecebb2c8543d5/582_0_4800_3840/master/4800.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=79b5d0c09db3a4b6415c8f190ba0469a",N,,2025-10-17 00:02:30.693280

This research clearly illustrates the value of Auto Shows — for brands, dealers and consumers alike,"" said Mark Schienberg, president of the Greater New York Automobile Dealers Association. ""Fully half of in-market visitors add at least one new brand to their consideration list as a result of attending—but only those brands who make the commitment to be at the show benefit from this incremental consideration"".

""Auto shows continue to play a vital role in the car-buying journey,"" said Terri Toennies, president of the Los Angeles Auto Show. ""The visitor survey data confirms that we help consumers make more confident, informed purchase decisions"".

""These results challenge the outdated notion that consumers have lost interest in in-person automotive experiences"", said Darren Slind, co-founder and president of Clarify. ""The evidence is clear and consistent across the three largest auto shows in North America that they remain a vital part of the path-to-purchase journey for consumers and offer a high-impact platform for manufacturers to grow brand engagement and consideration"".

About the Research

The findings are based on the feedback of nearly 9,000 Auto Show visitors across three Clarify-managed studies:

Los Angeles Auto Show Visitor Survey 2024

New York International Auto Show Visitor Experience Survey 2025

Canadian International AutoShow Visitor Experience Survey 2025

Natural Resources and Environmental Protection

This post begins by providing an overview of total spending for the departments overseen by the California Natural Resources Agency (CNRA) and California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA). Next, we discuss a number of cross-cutting issues that affect departments in both agencies, including Proposition 4, budget reductions, and spending from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF). We then discuss individual departments that had notable budget changes within each of the two agencies.

Overview

The 2025-26 budget package provides a total of $19.7 billion from various fund sources—the General Fund, a number of special funds, bond funds, and federal funds—for the departments overseen by CNRA and CalEPA. This amount represents 72 percent of total 2024-25 estimated expenditure levels. This significant year-to-year decrease is primarily due to significant one-time funding—mostly from the General Fund—available for the departments within both agencies in 2024-25, including large amounts of funds carried over from prior years. Figures 1 and 2 below show the funding totals for the major departments within CNRA and CalEPA. These totals incorporate authorized spending included in the budget package from Proposition 4 (the climate bond approved by voters in November 2024) and GGRF.

Cross-Cutting Issues

Proposition 4 Climate Bond Allocations

Budget Package Provides $3.5 Billion for First Year of Proposition 4 Implementation. As shown in Figure 3 below, the budget package authorizes the state to spend $3.5 billion, or slightly more than one third, of the $10 billion climate bond approved by voters through the November 2024 ballot. This amount was approved via three different 2025 budget actions: (1) $181 million provided through Chapter 2 (AB 100, Gabriel) in April 2025 (these funds were available for departments to spend during the final few months of 2024-25); (2) $2.9 million through Chapter 5 (AB 102, Gabriel); and (3) $3.3 billion through Chapter 104 (SB 105, Weiner). The budget package also authorized 79.5 new positions across 12 different departments to implement bond-funded programs. In order to help expedite bond implementation, budget trailer legislation—Chapter 106 (AB 149, Committee on Budget)—authorizes administering departments to use emergency regulations to develop and adopt guidelines and selection criteria for Proposition 4-funded programs. Please see our post, The 2025-26 California Spending Plan: Proposition 4, for more detailed information on Proposition 4 budget actions.

Budget Solutions

Budget Package Reduces About $900 Million From Prior Environmental Augmentations. Due to the state budget shortfall, the 2025-26 spending plan makes a number of reductions to previous and planned General Fund augmentations. Figure 4 below provides a summary of the reductions to environmental programs included in the 2025-26 budget agreement, totaling $898 million. As shown, most of these are within CNRA and CalEPA departments. The two largest reductions total $500 million from Proposition 98 General Fund that had been planned to support the purchase of and infrastructure for zero-emission school buses in 2025-26 as part of a previously-approved zero-emission vehicles (ZEV) package. (This action creates savings within the Proposition 98 school spending requirement.) Most of the rest of the funding shown in the figure was provided in 2024-25; as such, the budget package reverts the funds in order to achieve savings. In all but one case, these represent reversions of one-time appropriations, resulting in one-time General Fund savings. (We discuss the one ongoing reduction—$750,000 resulting from the Department of Water Resources [DWR] changing the frequency of publishing its groundwater bulletin—later in this post.)

Shifts Some Funding to Other Sources. The budget package also shifts spending for two environmental activities that had been planned for General Fund support to other sources in order to achieve General Fund savings without having programmatic impacts. These shifts include (1) using $1 billion from GGRF for operations of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire) and (2) relying on $35 million from the Lead-Acid Battery Cleanup Fund to support the Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) in conducting clean-up activities at the Exide facility and surrounding communities. While both of these shifts apply just to 2025-26, the budget package includes language stating intent to provide additional GGRF funding to CalFire in future years to achieve General Fund savings. Specifically, if the General Fund continues to experience deficits, the plan intends that GGRF would cover $1.25 billion of CalFire’s costs in 2026-27, $500 million in 2027-28, and $500 million in 2028-29. If the General Fund is not projected to be in a deficit in 2026-27, GGRF would only cover $500 million for CalFire in that year.

Additionally, as noted in Figure 4, the budget package uses Proposition 4 to help offset the impacts of some General Fund reductions. Specifically, the budget reduces $298 million General Fund from previous appropriations for nine programs but also provides Proposition 4 funding for similar activities. The bond funds will help mitigate the programmatic impacts of the state providing less General Fund than it had originally planned for these programs. In some cases, however, the bond-supported programs—and, therefore, the projects that ultimately will end up being funded—may differ slightly from those that might have been funded with the General Fund, so this approach does not represent a dollar-for-dollar backfill in all cases.

Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund Expenditure Plan

Assumes $4.1 Billion in Total GGRF Expenditures. The budget package assumes a total of $4.1 billion in expenditures from GGRF in 2025-26. This includes $2.4 billion in statutorily-required appropriations—most of which are continuously appropriated—for the high-speed rail project and various other programs, such as for housing, transit, forest health, and drinking water. (Because most of the statutorily-required appropriations currently are set as a percentage of cap-and-trade auction proceeds, the amount they ultimately will receive is uncertain and will depend upon how much revenue is generated over the coming year.)

Most Discretionary Spending Directed to Support General Fund and Motor Vehicle Account. In addition to the statutorily required expenditures, the budget package also includes $1.7 billion in discretionary spending in 2025-26, as shown in Figure 5 below. Most of this— $1 billion—is related to the CalFire fund shift described above, replacing a like amount of General Fund to provide budget relief. Additionally, in order to help the Motor Vehicle Account remain solvent in 2025-26, the budget includes $81 million to pay for costs that otherwise would have to be paid by that account. (Please see our post, The 2025-26 California Spending Plan: Transportation, for more discussion of issues related to the Motor Vehicle Account.) The other discretionary allocations represent some, but not all, of the funding that was originally planned for 2025-26 as part of the 2024-25 multiyear GGRF expenditure plan. These include $368 million for the Transit and Intercity Rail Capital Program, $100 million to address local air pollutants in disadvantaged communities pursuant to Chapter 136 of 2017 (AB 617, Garcia), a total of $65 million for two ZEV-related programs, and $7 million for livestock methane reduction. (To identify which programs did and did not receive GGRF as planned for in previous years, please see our description of the prior multiyear funding plan in our September 2024 publication, The 2024-25 California Spending Plan: Natural Resources and Environmental Protection.)

Legislature Extended Cap-and-Invest Program Through 2045. Separate from the budget, in September 2025, the Legislature adopted two significant pieces of legislation related to the cap-and-trade program and GGRF. First, Chapter 117 of 2025 (AB 1207, Irwin) extended the sunset on the program from 2030 to 2045, renamed it “cap-and-invest,” and included various other changes. Second, Chapter 121 of 2025 (SB 840, Limón) revised the existing statutory allocation amounts that support particular activities starting in 2026-27, including changing many from being set percentages of GGRF revenues to fixed amounts. (We plan to discuss AB 1207 and SB 840 further in a forthcoming brief.)

Efficiency and Vacant Position Reductions

2025-26 Budget Implements Control Sections First Added in 2024-25. Control Sections 4.05 and 4.12 of the 2024-25 and 2025-26 budget acts directed the Department of Finance (DOF) to identify efficiencies to reduce costs without adverse effects on state services. (DOF exempted certain departments—including CalFire and the California Conservation Corps—from reductions pursuant to these control sections due to their role in wildfire response.) DOF subsequently worked with departments to implement these reductions. Please see the forthcoming “New and Ongoing Efforts to Achieve Efficiencies” section of our post, The 2025-26 California Spending Plan: Other Provisions, for more information on Control Sections 4.05 and 4.12. Below, we discuss how these control sections affect CNRA and CalEPA departments in the 2025-26 budget.

Reduces State Operations Funding for CNRA and CalEPA Departments. Control Section 4.05 directed savings to be achieved through “operational efficiencies and other cost reduction measures including, but not limited to, reorganizations, eliminations of boards and commissions, rate changes, contract reductions, elimination of excess positions, and the cancellation or postponement of information technology projects.” As shown in Figure 6, through Control Section 4.05 the budget package reduces $189 million across CNRA and CalEPA departments in 2025-26 and ongoing, including $38 million from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, $29 million from the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB), and $25 million from the California Air Resources Board (CARB). (The budget package scored about the same level of savings through this control section for the 2024-25 fiscal year.) These amounts reflect reductions made pursuant to AB 102. Of this total, 28 percent ($53 million) consists of reductions to General Fund spending and the remainder ($136 million) is from special funds. Due to the timing of when budget actions occurred and how DOF reflected these actions in its fiscal documents, some—but not all—of these state operations reductions are reflected in the department totals displayed earlier in Figures 1 and 2.

Scores Some Savings Related to Vacant Positions, With Additional Reductions and Position Eliminations Still Pending. Control Section 4.12 directed savings to be achieved by eliminating vacant positions and associated funding. The budget package scored $108 million in savings from vacant positions at CNRA and CalEPA pursuant to this control section for the 2024-25 fiscal year, but did not permanently eliminate any positions. As shown in the figure, Chapter 4 of 2025 (SB 101, Weiner) made $42 million in reductions pursuant to Control Section 4.12 in 2025-26. These reductions, nearly all from the General Fund, are reflected in the department totals displayed earlier in Figures 1 and 2. Subsequently, AB 102 included language in Control Section 4.12 directing DOF to provide the Legislature with supplementary information prior to making additional funding reductions in 2025-26 or permanently eliminating any vacant positions. Specifically, the Legislature—through the Joint Legislative Budget Committee—has until January 1, 2026, to review and potentially “nonconcur” with the administration’s proposals for permanently eliminating position authority (totaling 874 positions across CNRA and CalEPA departments). Depending on the outcome of that review and decision, DOF could reduce additional spending authority totaling up to $67 million annually from multiple special funds across CNRA and CalEPA departments in 2025-26 and ongoing pursuant to Control Section 4.12.

California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Changes and Coastal Act Exemptions

Legislation Modifies Environmental Review Requirements for Urban Housing and Other Projects. Several pieces of budget trailer legislation authorize modifications to the traditional CEQA process in an effort to accelerate housing production and certain other development projects. Specifically, Chapter 22 of 2025 (AB 130, Committee on Budget) exempts qualified urban infill housing projects from CEQA. In addition, it amends the Coastal Act to prevent appeals of local permits for multifamily housing (four or more units) in the coastal zone on the basis of the project being located in a sensitive coastal resource area or not being the principally permitted use. Assembly Bill 130 also shortens coastal zone housing permit review times under the Permit Streamlining Act, generally from 180 to 90 days. Chapter 24 of 2025 (SB 131, Committee on Budget and Fiscal Review) further amends CEQA to require that housing development projects meeting all but one CEQA exemption criteria be reviewed solely on that issue. It also adds CEQA exemptions for various specified types of projects, including certain housing-related rezoning, farmworker housing, advanced manufacturing facilities, high-speed rail facilities, wildfire risk reduction projects, health clinics, day care centers, public parks, and nonmotorized recreational trail facilities. Additionally, it extends for four years (until 2032) an existing CEQA exemption for small disadvantaged community water system or state small water system projects. For more information about how this legislation—as well as Chapter 650 of 2025 (SB 158, Committee on Budget and Fiscal Review), which makes some refinements to the CEQA-related changes—affect housing development, please see our forthcoming post, The 2025-26 California Spending Plan: Housing, Homelessness, and Local Government.

Legislation Eases CEQA and Coastal Act Requirements for Official Olympics-Related Development. Assembly Bill 149 exempts from CEQA the construction of temporary facilities for the 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games and also exempts any temporary Olympics facility located in the coastal zone from having to obtain a coastal development permit.

Natural Resources

California Natural Resources Agency

The budget provides $273 million from various fund sources to support CNRA in 2025-26, which represents a decrease of $446 million (62 percent) when compared to the revised 2024-25 expenditure level due primarily to the expiration of one-time funds. (This total includes funding the agency receives on behalf of the Ocean Protection Council and Salton Sea Conservancy.) The 2025-26 spending plan appropriates $91 million from Proposition 4 specifically for CNRA, including $47 million for the Urban Greening Program. Additionally, the budget includes a total of $77 million General Fund in 2025-26 for CNRA to coordinate and distribute across a variety of one-time efforts and projects. The largest of these include $13.6 million for restoration efforts at Clear Lake and $10 million for the Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles.

Department of Forestry and Fire Protection

The budget provides $4.5 billion from various fund sources to support CalFire in 2025-26, which represents a decrease of $667 million (13 percent) when compared to the revised 2024-25 expenditure level. This total includes $305 million and 902 positions in 2025-26 to continue implementing CalFire’s shift to a 66-hour workweek, which is $106 million and 564 positions more than 2024-25. The spending plan also provides $279 million from Proposition 4 to CalFire for various activities (including $14 million each to pass through to the Wildfire Conservancy and Wildfire Foundation). Additionally, as discussed above, CalFire’s budget includes $1 billion from GGRF and a commensurate year-to-year reduction in General Fund. Notable other features of CalFire’s 2025-26 budget include the following:

Transition of Seasonal Firefighters to Permanent Classification. The budget provides $39 million General Fund in 2025-26, with budget bill language stating the Legislature’s intent to provide $78 million General Fund in 2026-27 and ongoing, for CalFire to begin transitioning some seasonal firefighter positions to a permanent classification. (Subsequent statutory revisions to the language clarified that all seasonal firefighter positions, not only those positions on hand crews, are eligible for this transition.) The language also states the Legislature’s intent to transition the remainder of the seasonal firefighter positions to permanent eventually, subject to future funding and legislation.

Wildfire County Coordinator Program. The budget includes $9.5 million General Fund in 2025-26 for CalFire to support the California Fire Safe Council’s Wildfire County Coordinator Program. This program supports coordinators in 47 of 58 counties who work with local organizations and residents to improve community wildfire preparedness through education, events, and grant funding.

Home Hardening Program. The budget provides $3 million General Fund in 2025-26 for a home hardening program at CalFire, subject to future legislation.

Capital Outlay Projects. The budget includes $260 million—$91.5 million General Fund and $168.5 million in lease revenue bonds—for CalFire capital outlay projects in 2025-26, of which $163 million is newly approved and $97 million was approved as part of previous budget agreements. These projects include $95 million for the Butte Fire Center, $17 million for the Prado Helitack Base, and $11 million for the Macdoel Fire Station. To achieve budget savings, the spending plan also reverts $32 million General Fund that was previously appropriated for the acquisition phase of a new CalFire training center, as highlighted earlier in Figure 4.

Department of Parks and Recreation

The budget provides $1.2 billion from various fund sources to support the Department of Parks and Recreation (Parks) in 2025-26, which represents a decrease of $494 million (28 percent) when compared to the revised 2024-25 expenditure level. This decrease is primarily due to the expiration of one-time funds that were available to Parks in 2024-25. Parks’ budget includes $440 million from Proposition 4 in 2025-26 for three activities: The Statewide Parks Program, reducing climate impacts on disadvantaged communities and expanding outdoor recreation, and deferred maintenance. Notable other features of Parks’ budget include the following:

California State Parks Library Pass Program. The budget transfers $6.75 million General Fund in 2025-26 to the State Parks and Recreation Fund to continue the California State Parks Library Pass Program until June 30, 2026. The program provides free access to most state parks through passes that can be checked out from public library branches throughout the state.

Park Restoration and Capital Outlay Projects. The budget appropriates $6 million General Fund in 2025-26 to restore Topanga State Park and Will Rogers State Historic Park, both of which were damaged by the Palisades Fire in January 2025. In addition, the budget includes $23.3 million ($3.6 million General Fund) for capital outlay projects at Parks including $9 million for the California Indian Heritage Center, $4.8 million for R.H. Meyer Memorial State Beach, and $3.6 million for Will Rogers State Historic Park.

Invasive Mussel Infestation Prevention Program and Increase to Harbors and Watercraft Revolving Fund (HWRF) Fee. Assembly Bill 149 expands the existing state quagga and zebra mussel infestation prevention program to include all invasive mussel species, including the golden mussel. The legislation also increases and renames the existing invasive mussel prevention fee and adjusts it every other year for inflation. This fee revenue is deposited in the HWRF. Because annual expenditures from that fund currently exceed its typical level of revenues, budget bill language requires the administration to develop a proposal no later than January 10, 2027 to keep the HWRF in structural balance on an ongoing basis. Correspondingly, AB 149 affirms the Legislature’s intent to address the HWRF imbalance in subsequent legislation that could include further increases in the invasive mussel prevention fee.

Department of Water Resources

The budget package includes a total of $3 billion from various fund sources to support DWR in 2025-26, including $318 million from the General Fund. (The total also includes roughly $1.4 billion in annual payments from water contractors for DWR’s work on the State Water Project that is continuously appropriated outside of the annual budget act.) The 2025-26 DWR budget is down a net $2 billion (40 percent) from the estimated 2024-25 expenditure level, due primarily to the expiration of one-time funds. Below we discuss several notable changes in the DWR budget.

Appropriates $684 Million in Proposition 4 Funding for Water Resilience Projects. The spending plan appropriates $684 million in 2025-26 out of the nearly $2 billion contained in Proposition 4 for DWR. Appropriations include $232 million for the Dam Safety and Climate Resilience Program, $148 million for Salton Sea projects, $123 million for the Flood Control Subventions Program, $63 million for State Plan of Flood Control projects, $30 million for groundwater management activities, and $8 million for improvement and management of stream gages. For several other programs, the spending plan includes small augmentations to support planning and program design in 2025-26, with project funding to be appropriated in future years.

Includes $14.5 Million General Fund for Flood Management Activities. The spending plan provides $12.5 million in 2025-26 for state operations costs associated with management of urban flood risk reduction projects conducted in collaboration with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The budget package also approves $2 million in both 2025-26 and 2026-27 for the state’s cost share of the Yolo Bypass Comprehensive Study conducted by the Army Corps.

Provides Spending Authority for Salton Sea Projects. The state has received three installments totaling $245 million from the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation as part of the Inflation Reduction Act (2022) for projects at the Salton Sea. Prior years’ budgets provided spending authority for the first two installments. The 2025-26 spending plan provides $178 million in multiyear authority—$100 million in 2025-26, $60 million in 2026-27, $12 million in 2027-28, and $6 million in 2028-29—for the final installment plus a separate $2 million federal reimbursement agreement. In addition, the spending plan allows DWR to receive reimbursements in 2025-26 from CNRA ($8 million from Proposition 68 [2018]) and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife ($3 million from Proposition 84 [2006]) for planning and construction of projects, as well as the aforementioned $148 million appropriation from Proposition 4. While last year’s budget included $1.4 million in ongoing GGRF for DWR staffing costs for Salton Sea restoration projects, the current agreement eliminates this ongoing appropriation beginning in 2025-26.

Reduces Prior General Fund Augmentations by Nearly $80 Million. As noted earlier in Figure 4, the spending plan reduces several prior-year DWR General Fund appropriations to help solve the budget problem. These include $47 million for dam safety, $15 million for systemwide flood risk reduction, $11 million for flood management, and $5 million in the Urban Streams Restoration Program. (The impacts of the first two of these reductions will be somewhat offset by the new appropriations from Proposition 4.) Additionally, beginning in 2025-26, DWR will reduce the frequency with which it publishes a groundwater bulletin (from every five years to every ten), saving $750,000 annually on an ongoing basis.

Reduces Planned GGRF Appropriations for Oroville Pump Storage. The final GGRF spending plan eliminates planned funding for a pump storage project at the Oroville Dam. (This project is intended to allow the facility to use some of its existing pump storage capacity, while limiting the potential adverse environmental impacts associated with pumping.) The project received $10 million from the General Fund in 2023-24 to begin planning and was set to receive $230 million in total from GGRF across three years beginning in 2025-26 for later phases of the project, including construction. This year’s budget package, however, does not include the planned augmentation of $30 million in 2025-26 and does not specifically identify this as a priority for out-year GGRF, meaning that any subsequent support for the project will have to be requested through a future budget process.

Coastal Agencies

State Lands Commission (SLC). The spending plan includes two General Fund appropriations for SLC to carry out legally required activities. First, it provides $12.5 million on a one-time basis for SLC to continue decommissioning activities at Rincon Island in Ventura County, which involves remediation of soil, groundwater, and interstitial water contamination associated with oil and gas production from offshore state leases. The budget agreement also approves $4.1 million in 2025-26, $4.1 million in 2026-27, and $4.4 million in 2027-28 for restoration activities at the Bolsa Chica Lowlands in Orange County. Required activities include tidal inlet dredging and ongoing maintenance and operations.

State Coastal Conservancy (SCC). The spending plan provides SCC with $10.7 million from the Violation Remediation Account and $12 million in reimbursement authority from the State Coastal Conservancy Fund. The former will fund coastal projects—selected in collaboration with the California Coastal Commission (which enforces Coastal Act violations and collects associated penalties)—near where the violations occurred. The latter will allow SCC to receive expected funding from state and federal agencies that will support local grants. The spending plan also appropriates Proposition 4 funding to SCC for a variety of activities, including $63 million for coastal resilience activities, $51 million to support the Great Redwood Trail Agency, and $41 million to support San Francisco Bay restoration projects.

California Coastal Commission. The spending plan approves funding—$565,000 in 2025-26, $1.2 million in 2026-27, and $1.8 million in 2027-28 and ongoing, all from the General Fund—and eight permanent positions for the commission to assist local coastal governments in aligning their Local Coastal Programs (LCPs) with zoning changes in their housing elements within one year (as required by Chapter 282 of 2024 [AB 3093, Ward]. It also provides one-time funding—$107,000 General Fund—to implement Chapter 454 of 2024 (SB 1077, Blakespear), which requires the commission, in collaboration with the Department of Housing and Community Development, to issue guidance for local governments about updating their LCPs to simplify the permitting process for accessory dwelling units in the coastal zone.

San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC). The spending plan includes $500,000 in 2025-26 and $55,000 in 2026-27 from the Bay Fill Clean-Up and Abatement Fund to procure an electronic regulatory management system that will allow BCDC to comprehensively track and manage permits, including collecting fees. Associated statutory changes specify that the fund can be used for technology services, programs, and personnel supporting authorized uses of the fund.

California Energy Commission (CEC)

The budget includes a total of $1.4 billion from special funds and federal funds for CEC in 2025-26. This is a significant decrease from the estimated prior-year expenditure level of $2.8 billion, due largely to the expiration of one-time funding. The magnitude of the year-to-year decrease was partially offset by various one-time augmentations made to CEC’s budget in 2025-26, including $275 million from Proposition 4 primarily for offshore wind projects and $40 million from GGRF for heavy-duty ZEV charging infrastructure. As noted above, the budget package does not include $125 million that had been planned for 2025-26 from Proposition 98 General Fund for zero-emission school bus infrastructure. Two other notable modifications to CEC’s budget include the following:

Provides Authority to Use Various Federal Funds. The budget includes $672 million in Federal Trust Fund expenditure authority and $12 million in reimbursement authority related to the anticipated receipt of various federal grants funded by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, most notably from the Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnership program.

Provides Augmentations for Various Energy Projects. The budget includes $9 million from the General Fund for carbon-free energy projects. This includes (1) $5 million to support nuclear fusion projects, including related to the Fusion Research and Development Innovation Initiative; and (2) $4 million for the CADEMO offshore wind project, which is planned off the coast of Point Arguello (near Vandenberg Space Force Base).

Environmental Protection

California Air Resources Board

The spending plan includes a total of $956 million for CARB in 2025-26, almost entirely from special funds. This represents a significant decrease compared to CARB’s estimated expenditure level in 2024-25 of $1.4 billion due to expiration of one-time funding. As noted above, the budget package provides some discretionary GGRF for CARB—including $100 million for the AB 617 Community Air Protection Program—but does not include $375 million that had been planned for 2025-26 from Proposition 98 General Fund for purchasing zero-emission school buses. We discuss some other notable changes to CARB’s 2025-26 budget below.

Funds Hybrid and Zero-Emission Truck and Bus Voucher Incentive Project (HVIP). The budget includes $132 million from the Air Pollution Control Fund (APCF) for HVIP, which is a program that provides point-of-sale rebates to help reduce the purchase price of zero-emission trucks and buses. This funding is available as a result of a legal settlement between the state and Hino Motors (a subsidiary of Toyota).

Augments Funding for Clean Cars 4 All. In addition to the $25 million in GGRF provided for the Clean Cars 4 All program highlighted previously in Figure 5, in April 2025, the Legislature enacted AB 100 which provided an additional $20 million from the Enhanced Fleet Modernization Account on a one-time basis to support the Clean Cars 4 All program operated by air districts. This included a new appropriation of $17 million and the redirection of $3 million that previously had been provided to support a related program, the Enhanced Fleet Modernization program.

Supports Mobile Source Laboratory Equipment Support and Maintenance. The budget includes $8 million on an ongoing basis from the Certification and Compliance Fund (CCF) to support CARB’s mobile source laboratory in Riverside, which helps ensure that manufacturers meet the state’s emissions standards. This funding will support additional costs for maintenance, service, and training contracts, as well as additional equipment-replacements. The budget package also includes related budget trailer legislation that specifies that the deficiency fines that CARB assesses manufacturers are to be considered fees and deposited into the CCF. This change is expected to enable CCF to support these additional costs.

Extends Support to Implement Carbon Capture Legislation. The budget includes a total of $2 million in 2025-26 from the Cost of Implementation Account (rising to $4 million ongoing) and 18 permanent positions to continue implementing Chapter 359 of 2022 (SB 905, Caballero), which was originally supported with limited-term resources. This legislation requires CARB to establish a Carbon Capture, Removal, Utilization, and Storage Program in order to develop and implement a regulatory framework for carbon capture and storage and carbon dioxide removal technologies.

Supports E15 Fuel Regulation Development and Implementation. The budget includes $2 million from APCF in 2025-26 and ongoing and 10 permanent positions to complete the regulatory process to allow the use of up to 15 percent ethanol in gasoline (known as the E15 fuel blend), as well as to conduct ongoing program implementation and enforcement of potential future E15 regulations. (After the passage of the budget, the Governor signed Chapter 247 of 2025 [AB 30, Alvarez], which authorizes the use of E15 until CARB completes its regulatory process.)

Funds Implementation of Zero-Emission Airport Shuttle (ZEAS) Regulations. The budget includes 10 permanent positions starting in 2025-26 and related funding of $2 million from APCF starting in 2026-27 to support the implementation of the ZEAS regulations. (The Legislature rejected without prejudice funding proposed for the Zero-Emission Forklift and Advanced Clean Fleets regulations in light of the lack of federal waivers required to enforce these regulations.)

Includes Trailer Bill Legislation Related to Regulatory Fee Authority. The budget package includes Chapter 109 (SB 153, Committee on Budget and Fiscal Review), which authorizes CARB to assess fees related to implementing its Transport Refrigeration Unit regulations. (The Legislature did not adopt the broader regulatory fee authority that the administration had initially proposed in January.)

State Water Resources Control Board

The spending plan includes a total of $1.9 billion from all funding sources in 2025-26 for SWRCB, including $74 million from the General Fund. This represents a year-to-year reduction of $574 million, or 24 percent, mostly due to the expiration of prior one-time and bond funding. (As we discuss in our forthcoming post, The 2025-26 California Spending Plan: Housing, Homelessness, and Local Government, the budget package also suspends a number of municipal stormwater permits issued by regional water quality control boards.)

Includes $396 Million From Proposition 4 for Water Resilience Activities. Proposition 4 includes a total of nearly $1.2 billion for six programs administered by SWRCB. The 2025-26 spending plan provides project funding for four of these programs: $183 million for drinking water grants and loans, $11 million for tribal drinking water infrastructure projects, $153 million for water reuse and recycling, and $47 million to address water pollution in California-Mexico cross-border rivers and coastal waters. In addition, the budget approves planning dollars for multibenefit urban stormwater management and water data management.

Covers Groundwater Management Costs With Special Fund Loan. The Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) requires SWRCB to pay for its SGMA-related costs with revenues from fees it imposes on groundwater extractors. SWRCB can impose these fees when a groundwater basin has been designated as probationary due to noncompliance with SGMA. Although SWRCB has designated two basins—Tulare and Tule—as probationary, it has not yet been able to collect fees. To bridge the gap, the spending plan authorizes a loan of $16.4 million over three years (about $5.5 million per year) from the Underground Storage Tank Cleanup Fund to SWRCB’s SGMA program to support 22 existing positions. The loan must be repaid (with future fee revenues or General Fund) within four years.

Supports SWRCB’s Staffing Costs to Regulate Small Water Systems in Monterey County. The County of Monterey’s local primacy agency delegation for regulating public small water systems was recently terminated, meaning SWRCB must take over these responsibilities. The spending plan includes $2.7 million annually from the Safe Drinking Water Account beginning in 2025-26 and 12 permanent positions to carry out this regulatory program.

Reduces Prior-Year General Fund Spending and Planned GGRF Augmentations. As noted earlier, the spending plan reduces 2024-25 General Fund spending on water recycling by $51 million as part of the effort to resolve the state’s budget deficit. It also does not include previously planned 2025-26 GGRF augmentations of $15 million for water recycling and groundwater cleanup and $30 million for drinking water and wastewater. The impacts of all three of these modifications are offset to some degree by the new Proposition 4 spending.

Department of Toxic Substances Control

The budget provides $448 million from various fund sources to support DTSC in 2025-26. This reflects a $166 million (27 percent) decrease when compared to the estimated 2024-25 expenditure level. The decrease is largely associated with the expiration of one-time General Fund that DTSC received to address brownfields across the state and for cleanup activities related to the Exide facility in the City of Vernon.",https://lao.ca.gov/Content/Images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-17 00:02:20.636944

THE TOP FIVE

1. Amazon unveils plans for X-energy’s debut nuclear plant

A rendering of the future Cascade Advanced Energy Facility. Amazon

A year after Amazon invested in the small modular reactor developer X-energy, the tech giant has unveiled its plans to build a nearly gigawatt-sized plant in southeastern Washington, where it will install the nuclear company’s next-generation technology for the first time. The Cascade Advanced Energy Facility is set to begin construction “by the end of this decade,” with hopes of generating power from up to a dozen of X-energy’s 80-megawatt high-temperature gas-cooled reactors sometime “in the 2030s.” Amazon plans to build the plant in three phases, with four reactors at each stage, eventually reaching 960 megawatts in capacity. Located in Richland, Washington, along the Columbia River, the facility will nearly double the output of the Pacific Northwest’s only nuclear plant, the nearby Energy Northwest’s Columbia Generating Station.

In a sign of what Heatmap’s Katie Brigham called “the nuclear dealmaking boom” back in August, rival microreactor developer Oklo suggested at a recent public meeting in Tennessee that it may propose building some of its reactors near the Oak Ridge site of its debut nuclear waste recycling project, the Knoxville News Sentinel reported Monday. On Tuesday, meanwhile, the U.S. Army announced its new Janus program, which aims to supply bases by 2028 with microreactors like the ones Oklo aims to build, which generate 20 megawatts of electricity or less. The reactors would be owned and operated by private companies. “What resilience means to us is that we have power, no matter what, 24-7,” Jeff Waksman, principal deputy assistant secretary of the Army, told The Wall Street Journal.

2. Energy Department gives transmission project $1.6 billion loan

The Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office has largely revoked deals made under the previous administration since President Donald Trump returned to office. But on Thursday morning, the agency’s in-house lender announced a $1.6 billion loan guarantee to a subsidiary of utility giant American Electric Power to upgrade and rebuild about 5,000 miles of transmission lines across Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, and West Virginia. “This loan guarantee will not only help modernize the grid and expand transmission capacity but will help position the United States to win the AI race and grow our manufacturing base,” Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said in a press release.

The move came a day after a federal judge blocked the Trump administration’s effort to fire thousands of federal workers amid the ongoing government shutdown. At a hearing Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Susan Illston, a Clinton appointee based in California, granted labor unions’ request for a temporary restraining order to halt the dismissals. The hearing took place at the same time White House budget director Russ Vought appeared on the late conservative commentator Charlie Kirk’s podcast to preview his plans to lay off as many as 10,000 federal workers as the shutdown continued. The hearing will pause the job cuts for the roughly 4,000 workers who received notice so far. Illson said during the hearing that she granted the temporary restraining order because administration officials had “taken advantage of the lapse in government spending, government functioning, to assume that all bets are off, that the laws don’t apply to them anymore, and that they can impose the structures that they like on the government situation that they don’t like,” News From The States reported. “Things are being done before they’re thought through — very much ready, fire, aim.” Nearly 200 employees at the Department of Energy began receiving notices last week, as I wrote in yesterday’s newsletter.

3. Germany considers restarting the Nord Stream 2 pipeline

The underwater explosion of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline connecting Germany to Russia’s gas supply remains one of the world’s biggest geopolitical whodunnits, and Berlin’s fellow European Union members seem keen to keep it that way. In just the past two days, Poland and Italy blocked extradition requests to send suspected saboteurs to Germany for trial. But the Germans aren’t just looking to figure out who’s responsible for destroying the megaproject. The Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy is considering restarting the certification process for the pipeline, the daily newspaper Der Tagesspiegel reported Wednesday. The previous German government had ruled out a restart of the pipeline in March after news broke that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s business allies were angling to restore the project. In June, the new government under conservative Chancellor Friedrich Merz began examining legal avenues to block any future plans to reactivate the pipeline, the Financial Times reported at the time. But under current law, the economic ministry said this week a restart “cannot be ruled out in the medium term.”

4. Ohio fast-tracks energy construction on coal sites

Ohio passed a new law to fast-track energy projects on former coal mines and brownfields, Canary Media reported Wednesday. Called House Bill 15, the legislation took effect in August and lets the state’s Department of Development designate the former industrial sites as “priority investment areas” at the request of local governments. Roughly a third of Ohio’s 88 counties ban wind, solar, or both, but the language in the bill makes clear that “it was meant to be technology-neutral,” Rebecca Mellino, a climate and energy policy associate at The Nature Conservancy, told Canary’s Kathiann M. Kowalski.

A transition from coal could yield significant health benefits, as The New York Times reported on Tuesday. A recent study found that, when a coal-processing facility near Pittsburgh shut down, the number of emergency room visits for respiratory issues in the surrounding area dropped by about 20% in the month following the closure.

5. New AI tool could help tap 42% more conventional oil resources

The world’s annual consumption of oil isn’t expected to peak until the mid-2030s, and by 2050 it will reach a cumulative 1 trillion barrels, according to the consultancy Wood Mackenzie’s forecast. But production that’s either already onstream or ready for development is expected to gradually decline to 650 billion barrels per year by the mid century. What will make up the difference? “Traditional exploration will play its part but can’t get anywhere near bridging a gap of this scale,” Wood Mackenzie analysts wrote in a blog post on Wednesday. “Even the 21st century’s biggest new play, Guyana, with 15 billion barrels of oil, barely makes a dent.” To identify potential new resources, Wood Mackenzie rolled out a new AI-powered benchmark called Analogues, which “uses a machine learning method known as clustering to identify each field’s closest matches across 60 different attributes spanning rock properties, fluid characteristics, and commercial factors.” The AI tool could increase the share of recoverable conventional oil reserves by nearly 42%.

THE KICKER

Fusion energy is rapidly accelerating in the U.S., and the Department of Energy is poised to release a national plan for speeding up the deployment of the technology. In the meantime, states can prepare by beefing up regulatory capacity, speeding up permitting, clearing interconnection queues, and creating special tax credits. That’s according to a new roadmap from the Clean Air Task Force. “As fusion energy moves closer to commercial reality, states have a window of opportunity to prepare,” Jack Moore, a fusion policy consultant at CATF, wrote in a blog post. “Proactive policy design today can help states position themselves to create an effective environment for fusion energy deployment tomorrow.”",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTc2NDE2My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTgwNDU0MzUzOX0.jR6Ao8kNxFEfCIKN9N55KaFS22NQrAGjet4dKt_CnHk/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-10-16 23:05:47.123317

The world is falling behind on its renewable energy and efficiency goals despite record progress last year, says a report from the International Renewable Energy Agency, the COP30 Brazilian Presidency, and the Global Renewables Alliance.

In 2024, global renewable capacity additions reached 582GW. However, this is not enough to reach the COP28 UAE Consensus target of tripling renewables to 11.2TW by 2030.

Meeting that goal now demands 1,122GW of added capacity every year from 2025 onwards, requiring annual growth to accelerate to 16.6% through the decade, according to the second official tracking report on the landmark energy goals set by the UAE Consensus at COP28.

The progress report, Delivering on the UAE Consensus: Tracking progress toward tripling renewable energy capacity and doubling energy efficiency by 2030, also highlights that energy efficiency is an equal concern.

Global energy intensity improved by just 1% in 2024, far below the 4% annual gains needed to meet the UAE Consensus goal and keep the 1.5°C target alive.

The report calls for urgent action to:

Integrate renewable targets into national climate plans (NDC 3.0) ahead of COP30 in Belém.

Double collective NDC ambition to align with the global renewables goal.

Scale investment in renewables to at least $1.4trln per year in 2025-30 – more than doubling the $624bln invested in 2024.

Ben Backwell, Chair of the Global Renewables Alliance, comments, ‘The private sector is driving the energy transition, providing three-quarters of global clean energy investment. Our industries, led by wind, solar and hydropower, are already delivering growth, jobs and security.

'What we need now are long-term government plans that match national ambitions; we need pipelines that deliver projects. Plans must deliver enabling action on grids and storage and help maximise the benefits of the energy transition. This report shows that the march to renewable energy abundance is underway - and it’s time for us to accelerate.’

Everyone who’s not Duke Energy is still poring over this massive filing.","Duke Energy filed its 2025 resource plan earlier this month. The filing has drawn sharp criticism from environmental and clean energy advocates, and even has some business groups skeptical about future rate hikes.

WFAE’s climate reporter Zachary Turner sat down with host Nick de la Canal to break down what you need to know:

Nick de la Canal: To begin, what is this plan, and why should we care about it?

Zachary Turner: Duke files a resource plan every two years. It’s a roadmap that says what Duke’s going to build, like new power plants, when it’s going to build them, and about how much it’s going to cost ratepayers.

It also projects how much energy folks will need, and how the utility will supply it while lowering greenhouse gas emissions. Ideally.

De la Canal: Ideally?

Turner: Well, Duke’s resource plan also details how the utility will reach carbon neutrality by 2050. This means eliminating all greenhouse gas emissions that the utility doesn’t plan to offset with carbon credits.

Until earlier this year, the state mandated Duke to reduce emissions by 70% of 2005 levels by 2030 -- which is just five years away.

De la Canal: Right. That brings us to the differences between this plan and the 2023 plan. So, what’s changed?

Turner: The changes in this plan reflect the changes in the federal and state legislative landscape.

President Trump is ending clean energy tax credits, but preserving or creating incentives for battery storage and nuclear. He’s also putting his administration’s full weight behind fossil fuels.

Meanwhile, the state legislature rolled back that key 2030 climate target and made financing new nuclear reactors less risky for Duke Energy.

The result is a plan that pumps the brakes on solar energy, punts on wind energy and leans more heavily on natural gas and battery storage in the short term. Carbon pollution will go up during the next decade, with new gas plants coming online, and coal plants running up to an extra four years.

De la Canal: That makes sense. If the utility burns more fossil fuels, then its carbon emissions also go up.

Turner: Exactly. Burning fossil fuels is a primary driver of climate change. It’s also potentially driving up customers’ power bills, tying customer rates to fuels like natural gas that have volatile prices. Senior attorney David Neal with the Southern Environmental Law Center brought up that point at a recent conference in Raleigh:

David Neal: A big consequence of removing the interim target is unlocking Duke's plans to build more gas plants in the near term and to delay coal retirements, and that is going to put so much risk on customers

Turner: The plan also bets big on new nuclear reactors coming online in the late 2030s to curb those emissions and maybe even come close to meeting the 2050 carbon neutrality target.

De la Canal: What does that mean for the average person?

Turner: Right now, this is just a proposal. But if the commission approves this plan, it means bills will go up. Duke forecasts an unprecedented increase in energy demand over the next 10-15 years. That means building new infrastructure, increasing bills by an average 2.1% annually over the next 10 years.

There are also air quality concerns for power plant neighbors. For folks living near one of three coal plants, it means those facilities will continue running, with the Cliffside plant in Cleveland County running until 2040.

De la Canal: What are people saying about the plan?

Turner: Some business groups like Duke’s “all of the above” approach, because Duke markets this as the cheapest and most reliable pathway.

However, other groups, like the Carolina Utility Customers Association, worry more natural gas plants will strain North Carolina’s gas supply for industrial companies.

Other concerns about the plan fall into a few main camps:

There’s the climate problem. This plan goes against international climate goals to reduce near-term carbon emissions. We know Hurricane Helene and Tropical Storm Chantal were made worse by warmer ocean temperatures. Extreme heat and sea level rise continue to be a concern, and these problems don’t just go away if we reach carbon neutrality by 2050, and they certainly get worse the longer we burn fossil fuels.

Next, some groups worry that Duke plans to build too much new infrastructure. If Duke builds out a bunch of new gas-powered turbines for giant new electricity-guzzling customers like data centers who don’t ultimately come, ratepayers will get stuck with the bill.

De la Canal: What comes next?

Everyone who’s not Duke Energy is still poring over this massive filing. In the coming months, folks will comment on it and some groups might submit their own independent modeling of energy demand. The state’s new Energy Task Force, for example, will be trying to verify Duke’s findings.

Next year, the utilities commission will hold public hearings across the state before it takes a vote.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6ab7e45/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5568x2923+0+294/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe0%2F60%2F6413e56f4efeb467895c93bb33be%2F011423-duke-asheville-plant.JPG,N,,2025-10-16 23:06:02.406588

Dana Incorporated stated they ""made the difficult decision to close the manufacturing facility"" on Giddings Road in Auburn Hills due to ""unexpected and immediate reduction in customer orders driven by lower demand for electric vehicles."" People say this decision hurts them and their families.

""It’s hard. It’s hard. I’m a single mom of four. So this unexpected layoff is even harder,"" said Kassandra Pojok. ""There are a lot of single parents, a lot of people who are wondering, ‘How are we going to pay our rent?’ We have one check, not even a full check left. We were told not to work our last day.""

What they're saying:

Dana Corp provided the following statement, which reads in part:

""I can confirm that we have made the difficult decision to close our manufacturing facility located on Giddings Road in Auburn Hills, MI. This decision is the result of the unexpected and immediate reduction in customer orders driven by lower demand for electric vehicles, which has rendered continued operations at the plant no longer viable.

""We recognize the impact this decision has on our employees. We want to emphasize that notice was provided to affected employees as soon as the situation became clear. In accordance with all applicable labor laws and our collective bargaining agreements, we also provided timely and appropriate notice to union representatives and relevant government entities.

""Our priority remains supporting our employees through this transition. We are committed to working closely with them to provide resources and assistance during this time.

""Dana continues to operate our driveline manufacturing facility in Auburn Hills.""

Our work to advance clean energy was gutted by the federal administration in its recent termination of nearly $8 billion of federal grants.

IREC is an independent, non-partisan organization operating in states all across the country. However, because we are registered in New York, three top-performing national programs that IREC leads were targeted and eliminated last week as a punitive shutdown ploy, including our celebrated SolSmart program which has worked with nearly 600 local governments—representing one-third of the U.S. population—to cut red tape and unlock solar power from rural towns to big cities in both “red” and “blue” states. Terminating these contracts without cause is illegal, but we have already been forced to lay off many of our high-performing staff members.

I am reaching out to you as a loyal supporter of IREC. Despite the policy attack on clean energy from this administration, IREC’s mission has not changed:

Building the foundation for the rapid adoption of clean energy and energy efficiency, to benefit people, the economy, and our planet.

Connecting veterans to solar jobs? Placing more than a thousand new apprentices in clean energy? Building energy resilience hubs in Puerto Rico communities plagued by power outages? Providing the authoritative data on the state of the solar workforce through the National Solar Jobs Census? Unlocking clean energy grid access in more than 38 states through regulatory interventions?

IREC delivers all this and more through our strategic programs and dedicated, expert staff.

Here’s How You Can Help Right Now:

Our communities and planet need IREC’s work. We’re doubling down on our mission—and your support will help us get there.

That lawsuit says EPA violated the individual grant agreements it made with states and state energy authorities when it clawed its money back.","More than 20 states sued the Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday, challenging the agency’s decision to cancel a $7 billion program that aimed to make solar power accessible to low-income households.

The program, called “Solar For All,” was established in 2022 under the Inflation Reduction Act and had appropriated grants to deploy rooftop and community solar projects. It was part of the Biden administration’s push to reduce carbon pollution and was supposed to make solar power more accessible to nearly a million additional U.S. households.

But in August, the EPA announced that the program had been canceled and withdrew about 90% of grant funds from the accounts in which states had received the awards, according to the lawsuit.

The EPA has been aggressive in its attempts to claw back clean energy funding approved under the Biden administration. The new lawsuit will test whether the agency has overextended its reach in this case. The states behind the legal challenge had hoped that the funding would boost solar supply, reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with electricity production and lower the price of energy.

“Congress passed a solar energy program to help make electricity costs more affordable, but the administration is ignoring the law and focused on the conspiracy theory that climate change is a hoax,” Washington State Attorney General Nick Brown said in a news release. EPA’s decision “jeopardizes” about $156 million for Washington state, according to the release.

Earlier this month, a group of nonprofits and solar installers filed a similar lawsuit over the program’s cancellation.

In response to questions about the newest suit, the White House directed NBC News to the EPA, which declined comment on pending litigation, its typical practice.

The states behind the lawsuit all have Democrat attorneys general or governors. Washington, Arizona and Minnesota are leading the challenge. The complaint was filed in the Western District of Washington.

The lawsuit alleges that EPA “unilaterally and illegally terminated” the program, violating the Administrative Procedures Act, which determines how federal agencies can operate. It also says EPA overreached its “constitutional authority” by trying to cancel a program and funding that had been approved by Congress.

The new lawsuit is part of a two-pronged approach states are taking to fight the Trump administration’s cutbacks to clean energy programs passed under President Joe Biden.

On Wednesday, a similar group of plaintiffs, including states and state energy organizations, filed a separate complaint over the cancellation of individual grant agreements in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.

That lawsuit says EPA violated the individual grant agreements it made with states and state energy authorities when it clawed its money back.

The lawsuit claims that EPA used an “an erroneous and bad faith interpretation” of the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which passed under the Trump administration, to justify its actions.

The lawsuit acknowledges that the act gave the administration some ability to rescind Inflation Reduction Act funds, but it argues that the administration was only allowed to take funds that hadn’t already been given away to grantees.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251016-solar-farm-gk-cfecaf.jpg",N,,2025-10-16 21:04:13.705735

Electric utilities that receive loans through the program must provide assurances to the government that financial benefits from the financing will be passed on to customers, the Energy Department said.
Wright, in a conference call with reporters, distinguished the AEP loan guarantee from a $4.9 billion federal loan guarantee the department cancelled in July.
The loan guarantee to AEP was among those conditionally approved under Biden, a fact Wright acknowledged to reporters.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Department of Energy said Thursday it has finalized a $1.6 billion loan guarantee to a subsidiary of one of the nation's largest power companies to upgrade nearly 5,000 miles of transmission lines across five states, mostly in the Midwest, for largely fossil fuel-run energy.

AEP Transmission will upgrade power lines in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia to enhance enhance grid reliability and capacity, the Energy Department said. The project, first offered under the Biden administration, is meant to help meet surging electricity demand from data centers and artificial intelligence.

Ohio-based American Electric Power, which owns AEP Transmission, is one of the nation's largest utilities, serving 5.6 million customers in 11 states. It primarily produces electricity from coal, natural gas and nuclear power, along with renewable resources such as wind and hydroelectric power.

Thursday's announcement deepens the Trump administration’s commitment to traditional, polluting energy sources even as it works to discourage the U.S. from clean energy use.

Earlier this month, the administration cancelled $7.6 billion in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election. A total of 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable, the Energy Department said.

The cancellations include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub aimed at developing clean-burning hydrogen fuels to power ships and heavy-duty trucks. A hydrogen project costing up to $1 billion in the Pacific Northwest also was cancelled.

The loan guarantee finalized Thursday is the first offered by the Trump administration under the recently renamed Energy Dominance Financing program created by the massive tax-and-spending law approved this summer by congressional Republicans and signed by President Donald Trump. Electric utilities that receive loans through the program must provide assurances to the government that financial benefits from the financing will be passed on to customers, the Energy Department said.

The project and others being considered will help ensure that Americans ""will have access to affordable, reliable and secure energy for decades to come,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement.

“The president has been clear: America must reverse course from the energy subtraction agenda of past administrations and strengthen our electrical grid,'' Wright said, adding that modernizing the grid and expanding transmission capacity ""will help position the United States to win the AI race and grow our manufacturing base.”

The upgrades supported by the federal financing will replace existing transmission lines in existing rights-of-way with new lines capable of carrying more energy, the power company said.

More than 2,000 miles of transmission lines in Ohio serving 1.5 million people will be replaced, along with more than 1,400 miles in Indiana and Michigan serving 600,000 customers, the company said. An additional 1,400 miles in Oklahoma, serving about 1.2 million people and 26 miles in West Virginia, serving 460,000 people, will be replaced.

The projects will create about 1,100 construction jobs, the company said.

The loan guarantee will save customers money and improve reliability while supporting economic growth in the five states, said Bill Fehrman, AEP's chairman, president and chief executive officer. “The funds we will save through this program enable us to make additional investments to enhance service for our customers,"" he added.

Wright, in a conference call with reporters, distinguished the AEP loan guarantee from a $4.9 billion federal loan guarantee the department cancelled in July. That money would have boosted the planned Grain Belt Express, a new high-voltage transmission line set to deliver solar and wind-generated electricity from the Midwest to eastern states.

The Energy Department said at the time it was “not critical for the federal government to have a role” in the first phase of the $11 billion project planned by Chicago-based Invenergy. The department also questioned whether the project could meet strict financial conditions required, a claim Wright repeated Thursday.

“Ultimately that is a commercial enterprise that needs private developers,” Wright said. The company has indicated the Grain Belt project will go forward.

Trump and Wright have repeatedly derided wind and solar energy as unreliable and opposed efforts to combat climate change by moving away from fossil fuels. Wright said the Grain Belt Express loan was among billions of dollars worth of commitments “rushed out the door” in the waning days of former President Joe Biden’s administration.

The loan guarantee to AEP was among those conditionally approved under Biden, a fact Wright acknowledged to reporters.

“Not all of the (Biden-era) projects were nonsense,"" he said, adding that he was “happy to move forward” with the transmission upgrade.",https://images.wral.com/asset/business/2025/10/16/22202083/68f133363ea51-media_74dbfe848d1e42769417ea585d121498-DMID1-68o9ahl6v-640x480.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 21:05:07.000482

Three of the nation’s eight existing LNG export terminals are located in Cameron Parish, and several more are proposed or under construction there.
Louisiana’s attorney general vowed to appeal the ruling, which vacated the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy’s coastal use permit for the facility.
“This is the first time any court has vacated a permit for an LNG facility based on the government’s refusal to consider climate change impacts,” said Clay Garside, an attorney representing the Sierra Club and other environmental groups.
In regulatory filings, the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy said that “climate change is currently beyond the scope” of the state’s regulatory review.","NEW ORLEANS (AP) — A Louisiana judge has tossed out a key permit for a liquefied natural gas facility that won approval from President Donald Trump’s administration, ordering a state review of how the facility’s planet-warming emissions would affect Gulf Coast communities vulnerable to sea-level rise and extreme weather.

Last week, a judge from Louisiana’s 38th Judicial District Court effectively halted construction of Commonwealth LNG by ordering state regulators to analyze the facility’s climate change and environmental justice-related impacts, in conjunction with the broader LNG buildout in southwest Louisiana’s Cameron Parish.

Three of the nation’s eight existing LNG export terminals are located in Cameron Parish, and several more are proposed or under construction there.

Louisiana’s attorney general vowed to appeal the ruling, which vacated the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy’s coastal use permit for the facility.

“This is the first time any court has vacated a permit for an LNG facility based on the government’s refusal to consider climate change impacts,” said Clay Garside, an attorney representing the Sierra Club and other environmental groups.

Earlier this year, Trump reversed a Biden-era pause on exports of liquefied natural gas, or LNG, as part of his goal to boost natural gas exports and promote “energy dominance.”

Last year, the Biden administration’s Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm’s had warned that “unfettered exports” of liquefied natural gas would increase planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions — a statement reflecting the findings of a Department of Energy report released in December.

Trump-appointed Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a fossil fuel executive, has moved to fast-track the buildout of LNG facilities, including Commonwealth LNG, which received an export authorization within weeks of Trump’s inauguration.

“Cameron Parish is ground zero for the relentless expansion of the gas export industry,” said Anne Rolfes, founder of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, an environmental group involved in the litigation. “We’re going to stop it and this is an important step in that process.”

Lyle Hanna, a Commonwealth LNG spokesperson, said that “we are disappointed with the District Court’s decision, and we are exploring all available legal options.”

A spokesperson for the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy declined to comment, citing the potential of pending litigation. Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said that the state planned to appeal.

“Sadly even state court judges are not immune from climate activism,” Murrill said.

Last year, a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., had ordered the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to reassess Commonwealth LNG’s air pollution, including its greenhouse gas emissions. In June, the commission gave the project a greenlight on the grounds that its construction was in the public interest.

In regulatory filings, the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy said that “climate change is currently beyond the scope” of the state’s regulatory review.

But District Judge Penelope Richard rejected this position, saying state environmental regulators have a duty to consider how the LNG facility, along with others clustered nearby, would impact extreme weather events, storm severity and sea-level rise in a state where a football field-worth of land disappears every 100 minutes.

Richard also ordered state regulators to analyze the facility’s impacts on local communities, especially those living in poverty or relying on fishing for their livelihoods — which she noted was the “defining characteristic” of the parish. While the facility could destroy marshes, harm water quality and displace residents, the judge wrote, “none of it was considered in terms of impacts on environmental justice communities.”

Commercial fisherman Eddie LeJuine, a lifelong Cameron Parish resident, applauded the ruling. He said the buildout of LNG infrastructure, including dredging for shipping channels, has significantly harmed the fishing industry.

“The fishermen are barely hanging on with a thread,” LeJuine said. “These plants are killing the estuary and killing our livelihoods. We’re getting extinct.”

In August, a dredging channel being developed by LNG firm Venture Global leaked into a nearby estuary. Local fishermen like LeJuine say the onslaught of saltwater and sediment will kill off large amounts of oyster, crab and fish.

Venture Global, which is in the process of constructing a second LNG export terminal in the parish, said it is “committed to conservation” and is working with state regulators and the community to respond to the incident.

In a letter to President Donald Trump and Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright, the two-term Democrat urged the administration to oppose terminating federal grants for energy-related projects.
“As Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, my job is to help Kentucky move forward,” Beshear said in the letter.
“I strongly urge your administration to reject DOE’s proposed cuts to these crucial energy projects in Kentucky.
In his letter, Beshear said the project is bringing manufacturing and jobs back to America.","Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear wants to protect the state’s energy projects at risk of losing federal funding.

In a letter to President Donald Trump and Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright, the two-term Democrat urged the administration to oppose terminating federal grants for energy-related projects.

Cuts could threaten 700 jobs and $537 million of economic development in rural communities and undermine Trump’s attempt to bring jobs back to the U.S., Beshear said in the letter dated Oct. 15.

“As Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, my job is to help Kentucky move forward,” Beshear said in the letter. “I strongly urge your administration to reject DOE’s proposed cuts to these crucial energy projects in Kentucky.

“These cuts will only set back economic development and job opportunities in Kentucky and hurt our country’s international competitiveness and progress on re-shoring domestic manufacturing,” he said.

Kentucky has been the recipient of several recent high-dollar economic development announcements related to clean energy, the electric vehicle supply chain and more through incentives from the legislature and tax credits for consumers passed under former President Joe Biden.

Proposed cuts across the U.S. were outlined in a list reported by several media outlets last week, outlining hundreds of project grants totaling about $24 billion the Trump administration might target.

At the start of October, the Department of Energy terminated 321 financial packages totaling more than $7.5 billion for 223 projects, several of which are on the long list, according to E&E News. About two dozen other grants canceled earlier in the year also appear on the list.

“As Secretary Wright made clear last week, the Department continues to conduct an individualized and thorough review of financial awards made by the previous administration,” said the department’s chief spokesperson Ben Dietderich in an emailed statement to the Herald-Leader last week. His office said it had been unable to verify the list.

The cuts so far this year, and the new list indicating more might be coming, match Trump’s agenda to cancel clean energy programs. His administration has often criticized renewable energy, especially the effort to reduce carbon emissions, as part of a “green energy scam.”

Most of the cuts made earlier this month yanked funding from Democratic states. Members of Congress from those states said in a letter to the department secretary the decision was blatantly partisan and would harm jobs, weaken the grid and give foreign adversaries like China an edge.

The new, longer list includes grant projects in Republican states, too.

Of those projects in Kentucky on the list is a $316 million award for Ascend Elements, Inc. The Massachusetts-based manufacturer announced in October 2022 it would invest $1 billion in its largest electric vehicle battery recycling and manufacturing facility in Hopkinsville creating 400 full-time jobs.

The company’s CEO Linh Austin said last week he’d been notified Oct. 7 the grant had been terminated but any DOE decision regarding grants doesn’t change the company’s trajectory, and it plans to resume construction next spring.

Beshear said the facility will reduce the country’s reliance on battery-related imports from other countries since the U.S. does not produce the critical materials to domestically produce the appropriate amount of batteries to match demand.

Also targeted on the list is a $75 million grant for Diageo, the alcoholic beverage company, which planned to add batteries to its facility in Shelbyville to reduce carbon emissions.

That grant was terminated in May, as was a $72 million one for a carbon capture project at LG&E and KU’s Cane Run Generating Station just outside Louisville. It also appears on the longer list.

The $50 million grant supporting Mitsubishi Electric Corporation as it retrofits a Maysville factory to make high-efficiency heat pumps could also have its funding cut, according to the list.

In his letter, Beshear said the project is bringing manufacturing and jobs back to America. China builds 95% of the heat compressors the factory anticipates producing. At capacity, the facility can make over 1 million each year, Beshear said.

Five projects through the University of Kentucky Research Foundation are on the list and could stand to lose almost $24 million altogether.",https://www.kentucky.com/public/latest-news/tertzo/picture311605398/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/PAD_8192.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 06:03:06.408559

Meanwhile, local fishermen have voiced their relief and support for the ruling, pointing out the detrimental impact of LNG infrastructure on their industry.","A significant development occurred in Louisiana as a state judge has invalidated a critical permit for the Commonwealth LNG facility, which previously had the endorsement of the Trump administration. This ruling mandates a thorough state review of the facility’s greenhouse gas emissions and their implications for Gulf Coast communities, which are increasingly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, including sea-level rise and extreme weather events.

The ruling, delivered by a judge from Louisiana’s 38th Judicial District Court, halts any ongoing construction activities for the LNG facility until state regulators can address these pressing environmental and climate justice concerns. This comes in the wake of heightened scrutiny regarding the expansion of liquefied natural gas (LNG) operations in Cameron Parish, an area already home to three of the eight existing LNG export terminals and several others in various stages of approval or construction.

Louisiana’s Attorney General has announced plans to appeal this ruling, which nullified the coastal use permit issued by the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy. Environmental groups, including the Sierra Club, have hailed the decision as a significant milestone in their ongoing battle against LNG expansions, emphasizing that this is the first instance where a court has revoked a permit based on climate change considerations.

The discourse around LNG has been polarized, particularly following President Trump’s reversal of a Biden-era pause on LNG exports, aiming to amplify natural gas exports to achieve “energy dominance.” Critics have raised alarms over the potential increase in greenhouse gas emissions exacerbated by what they term “unfettered exports” of LNG, a concern echoed by the previous administration’s Energy Secretary, Jennifer Granholm.

Former Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who was appointed by Trump and has ties to the fossil fuel sector, played a role in expediting LNG facility approvals, including Commonwealth LNG’s, which received its export authorization shortly after Trump took office.

Local environmental advocates have highlighted Cameron Parish as a pivotal battleground for the expansion of the gas export industry, expressing their determination to challenge its growth. They underscored the urgent need for regulatory scrutiny of how such developments strain local ecosystems and threaten communities reliant on fishing and other natural resources for their livelihoods.

In a response to the court’s ruling, a spokesperson for Commonwealth LNG expressed disappointment, indicating that the company is assessing all legal avenues available to contest the decision. Meanwhile, local fishermen have voiced their relief and support for the ruling, pointing out the detrimental impact of LNG infrastructure on their industry.

The ruling also follows a previous federal appeals court mandate requiring the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to reassess Commonwealth LNG’s air pollution impact, including greenhouse gas emissions. Despite initial approval in June based on public interest grounds, the ongoing legal challenges signal a shift in the regulatory landscape.

The court has mandated that regulators not only consider environmental impacts but also the potential risks to local communities, especially those living in poverty or dependent on fishing. Residents, like lifelong Cameron Parish fisherman Eddie LeJuine, have expressed grave concerns that the LNG operations are threatening their way of life and disrupting local ecosystems, evidenced by a recent incident involving a dredging channel leakage that harmed nearby estuaries.

As this legal battle unfolds, it underscores the continuing tension between economic development, energy policies, and environmental justice in Louisiana’s rapidly changing landscape.",https://news.ssbcrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Louisiana-Judge-Vacates-Permit-for-Controversial-LNG-Facility-Citing-Climate.com2F5b2F2c2F16f4c52a96f9f88dccb7cd9117a42F823e6eca7c9742f4badb.jpeg,N,,2025-10-16 23:06:11.442377

“We don’t care about authorship,” Wright told reporters, acknowledging that the AEP loan was conditionally approved by the Biden administration.
When I floated Wright’s comments by Jigar Shah, the former head of the Loan Programs Office under the Biden administration, he was flummoxed.
To Shah, taking Wright’s risk aversion to its logical conclusion would mean, for instance, that the office should not fund any nuclear energy projects.
“The Loan Program Office is being rechristened the Energy Dominant Financing — it is the rechristening of the same department,” he said in response to a question about the office’s remaining loan authority.","Energy Secretary Chris Wright on Thursday announced a $1.6 billion loan guarantee for American Electric Power to replace 5,000 miles of transmission lines with more advanced wires that can carry more electricity. He also hinted at his vision for how the Trump administration could recast the role of the department's Loan Programs Office in the years to come.

The LPO actually announced that it had finalized an agreement, conditionally made in January under the Biden administration, to back AEP’s plan. The loan guarantee will enable AEP to secure lower-cost financing for the project, for an eventual estimated saving to energy consumers of $275 million over the lifetime of the loan.

“These are the kind of projects where we’re going to partner with businesses to make our energy system more efficient, more reliable, ultimately lower cost,” Wright said on a call with reporters.

And yet in the past few months, the department has also canceled loan guarantees and grants for other transmission projects that were expected to provide those same benefits — including the Grain Belt Express, an 800-mile line set to bring low-cost wind power from Kansas to the Chicago metropolitan area in Illinois.

“We don’t care about authorship,” Wright told reporters, acknowledging that the AEP loan was conditionally approved by the Biden administration. “Not all of them were nonsense. The ones that are in the interest of the American taxpayers, in the interest of the American ratepayers, and there’s a helpful role for government capital — we’re happy to support those.”

When asked specifically why AEP’s proposal met his criteria while the Grain Belt Express didn’t, Wright first made an argument about cost. “I have nothing against the Grain Belt Express,” he said. “I suspect it’ll still be developed. But it’s far more expensive on a per mile basis since it’s a brand new transmission line.”

His subsequent comments, however, hinted at a more significant shift in approach. He went on to argue that the project came with an unacceptable amount of risk since the developers didn’t have buyers yet for the power coming down the line. It was trying to “close on arbitrage,” he said, by buying up cheap wind power that was stranded in Kansas and bringing it to a larger market. “It’s a more commercial enterprise,” he said. “That’s done with private entrepreneurs and private capital.”

It’s important to note that the Grain Belt Express loan guarantee would have been issued under an innovation-focused program within the Loan Programs Office that was specifically geared toward higher risk projects that banks won’t otherwise touch. The AEP project is part of a different program focused on more mature technologies, with a goal of reducing the cost of major utility infrastructure upgrades to ratepayers.

When I floated Wright’s comments by Jigar Shah, the former head of the Loan Programs Office under the Biden administration, he was flummoxed. “It’s nonsensical,” he said. To Shah, taking Wright’s risk aversion to its logical conclusion would mean, for instance, that the office should not fund any nuclear energy projects. “If this becomes a new standard, that means nuclear is dead in the United States,” he said.

AEP is the first developer to secure a loan guarantee under the Energy Dominance Financing Program, Congress’ new name a Biden-era program within LPO that offered loan guarantees to utilities to “retool, repower, repurpose, or replace energy infrastructure.” Initially called the Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment Financing Program and created by the Inflation Reduction Act, it focused on projects with climate benefits, like making efficiency upgrades to power plants or installing renewables on the site of a former coal plant.

In the Biden administration’s view, AEP’s project would “contribute to emissions reductions by supporting existing and new clean generation by expanding transmission capacity in the regions in which they operate.”

Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act rebranded the program and removed any requirements that projects reduce emissions. On Thursday’s call, Wright seemed to imply that it wasn’t just the Biden-era loan program that had been renamed. “The Loan Program Office is being rechristened the Energy Dominant Financing — it is the rechristening of the same department,” he said in response to a question about the office’s remaining loan authority. The Department of Energy did not respond to my request for clarification.

None of that means that the potential emissions benefits from AEP’s project won’t materialize. Limited transmission capacity is one of the biggest obstacles for bringing new wind and solar power online, and reconductoring could also reduce line losses, making the overall grid more efficient.

The transmission project — which includes plans to rebuild some power lines and reconductor others — will ultimately increase capacity by more than 100%, a spokesperson for AEP told me. The first phase will involve upgrades to about 100 miles of wires across Ohio and Oklahoma, while future phases will tackle lines in Indiana, Michigan, and West Virginia, with the intent of meeting growing demand from data centers and manufacturing development, according to a press release.

When reporters asked Wright about the other conditional loan guarantees the Biden administration had issued under the Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment program that are still pending, the secretary stressed that he was looking for applicants that had identified a clear set of projects they would implement. “Many were done in a hurry, without really even having the projects that the loans would be associated with identified. You can end up with a grab bag of projects without a lot of say for where the money went,” he said.

Wright accused the Biden administration of failing to ask applicants to detail the impact the projects would have on taxpayers and ratepayers — a key question his colleagues are now asking.

Shah disagreed with that portrayal. The whole point of the program was to reduce interest rates for utilities and require them to pass on the benefit to ratepayers. All of the projects awarded conditional commitments met that bar, he said.

He warned that if the Trump administration didn’t honor the remaining conditional commitments to utilities under the program — all 10 of them — it risked losing the trust of any new companies it attempts to make similar deals with.

Last week, a judge from Louisiana’s 38th Judicial District Court effectively halted construction of Commonwealth LNG by ordering state regulators to analyze the facility’s climate change and environmental justice-related impacts, in conjunction with the broader LNG buildout in southwest Louisiana’s Cameron Parish.

Three of the nation’s eight existing LNG export terminals are located in Cameron Parish, and several more are proposed or under construction.

Louisiana’s attorney general vowed to appeal the ruling, which vacated the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy’s coastal use permit for the facility.

“This is the first time any court has vacated a permit for an LNG facility based on the government’s refusal to consider climate change impacts,” said Clay Garside, an attorney representing the Sierra Club and other environmental groups.

Earlier this year, Trump reversed a Biden-era pause on exports of liquefied natural gas, or LNG, as part of his goal to boost natural gas exports and promote “energy dominance.”

Last year, the Biden administration’s Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm’s hard warned that “unfettered exports” of liquefied natural gas would increase planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions — a statement reflecting the findings of a Department of Energy report released in December.

Trump-appointed Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a fossil fuel executive, has moved to fast-track the buildout of LNG facilities, including Commonwealth LNG, which received an export authorization within weeks of Trump’s inauguration.

“Cameron Parish is ground zero for the relentless expansion of the gas export industry,” said Anne Rolfes, founder of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, an environmental group involved in the litigation. “We’re going to stop it and this is an important step in that process.”

Lyle Hanna, a Commonwealth LNG spokesperson, said that “we are disappointed with the District Court’s decision, and we are exploring all available legal options.”

A spokesperson for the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy declined to comment, citing the potential of pending litigation. Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said that the state planned to appeal.

“Sadly even state court judges are not immune from climate activism,” Murrill said.

Last year, a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., had ordered the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to re-assess Commonwealth LNG’s air pollution, including its greenhouse gas emissions. In June, the commission gave the project a greenlight on the grounds that its construction was in the public interest.

In regulatory filings, the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy said that “climate change is currently beyond the scope of this review.”

But District Judge Penelope Richard rejected this position, saying state environmental regulators have a duty to consider how the LNG facility, along with others clustered nearby, would impact extreme weather events, storm severity and sea-level rise in a state where a football field-worth of land disappears every 100 minutes.

Richard also ordered state regulators to analyze the facility’s impacts on local communities, especially those living in poverty or relying on fishing for their livelihoods — which she noted was the “defining characteristic” of the parish. While the facility could destroy marshes, harm water quality and displace residents, the judge wrote, “none of it was considered in terms of impacts on environmental justice communities.”

Commercial fisherman Eddie LeJuine, a lifelong Cameron Parish resident, applauded the ruling. He said the buildout of LNG infrastructure, including dredging for shipping channels, has significantly harmed the fishing industry.

“The fishermen are barely hanging on with a thread,” LeJuine said. “These plants are killing the estuary and killing our livelihoods. We’re getting extinct.”

In August, a dredging channel being developed by LNG firm Venture Global leaked into a nearby estuary. Local fishermen like LeJuine say the onslaught of saltwater and sediment will kill off large amounts of oyster, crab and fish.

Venture Global, which is in the process of constructing a second LNG export terminal in the parish, said it is “committed to conservation” and is working with state regulators and the community to respond to the incident.

Torch is a renewables developer focused on the U.S. Mid-Atlantic and Southwest, and has developed and solar more than 1.2 GW of green power assets.

“Torch is excited to partner with Fluence to manufacture the energy storage system for our Winchester project,” said Torch President Travis Haggard. The battery “will allow us to shift cost-effective solar generation to be dispatched when the grid needs it most.”

Fluence’s Gridstack Pro 5000 battery will include domestically manufactured enclosures, inverters and thermal management systems “to enable the full solar-plus-storage facility to qualify for domestic content tax credits,” the companies said. Fluence says it has more than 22 GWh of battery energy storage capacity deployed or contracted across projects in the U.S.

“This facility is a great step toward ensuring affordable, reliable, and secure power for the local community and will support regional economic activity and expected load growth for many years to come,” Fluence Americas President John Zahurancik said in a statement.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/Y0rB8droWaA31hR9hCBgTv1ac6osFr91VeGo84lJM-Y/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9GbHVlbmNlX0dyaWRzdGFja19Db3JlLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-10-16 20:07:48.025403

The Louisiana Energy Security Summit 2025 in New Orleans featured U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy along with keynote speaker Kyle Haustveit and brought 70 thought leaders from around the country to discuss the state’s role in advancing U.S. energy dominance in the face of evolving global challenges.

“The president and our administration are determined to unleash greater energy production than ever before, utilizing every reliable energy source at our disposal,” said Haustveit, assistant secretary for Fossil Energy Department Management in the U.S. Department of Energy.

“And as we do this, we will unleash unparalleled prosperity across our nation, including this region,” said Haustveit, who addressed the summit by video because of the federal government shutdown.

Haustveit oversees Fossil Energy and National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) programs and manages a $5 billion research development portfolio that includes coal, oil, natural gas and critical minerals with the objective of advancing affordable and reliable energy solutions, according to the Department of Energy.

Haustveit said the previous administration pursued an anti-energy policy. “It restrained both energy production and the building of energy infrastructure such as natural gas pipelines.”

America needs both more energy and more energy diversity, said Haustveit, a North Dakota native whose family has worked in the energy industry for three generations.

“Thanks to the accelerating march of innovation and progress, including the president’s manufacturing revival and the coming rise in AI data center growth, a tidal wave of energy demand is headed our way and is about to wash over this nation and indeed the world,” Haustveit said.

Haustveit said the Energy Department’s Florence Berkeley National Lab estimated last year that data center demand for energy will double or triple by 2028. “The kind of energy we will need for these data centers will be rock solid energy that delivers 24-7 reliability. In other words, if we want to power these data centers and reindustrialize our country, we not only need more energy supply, we also need more energy diversity.,” said Haustveit.

“The United States needs to develop the most reliable energy sources on the planet, including coal and nuclear, oil and natural gas,” said Haustveit. “Without more energy and without more reliable energy, America will face an energy disaster with affordability and reliability issues unlike anything we’ve experienced since the advent of electricity,” he said.

Haustveit said Secretary of Energy Chris Wright has responded to the crisis by issuing eight emergency orders pursuant to Section 202c of the Federal Powers Act that have strengthened grid reliability during peak demand to prevent power outages and saved consumers at least $4.7 million in energy costs.

“We’re looking for stakeholder input on how best to utilize our funding programs and authorities to rapidly expand energy generation and transmission grid capacity,” the assistant secretary said. “As we improve our grid, we are committed to loading it with record supplies of reliable energy, including coal, nuclear and natural gas. Given the AI revolution alone and the coming surge in consumption, there is clearly no alternative to the pro energy course we are taking,” said Haustveit.

Haustveit said Energy Department leadership team has identified 16 potential sites at national labs and other DOE-owned land for AI data center development.

“We support removing regulations that constrain AI development, and we are unleashing DOE resources and the innovation of our national labs to ensure we have the resources to power the AI revolution. But again, none of this can be sustained without an unprecedented surge in energy supply,” said Haustveit.

Haustveit said the department is laser focused on fulfilling the president’s mandates on nuclear energy. He said the focus is on enabling the rapid deployment and export of next generation nuclear technology, bringing down operating costs for existing reactors, expanding the application of nuclear energy beyond electricity to support manufacturing and industry, strengthening nuclear fuel infrastructure, restarting reactors that were prematurely closed, and cutting regulations that have stifled the industry.

“Streamlining the permitting process will ensure nuclear developers get steel in the ground faster,” Hustveit said. “As vice chair of the new National Energy Dominance Council, Secretary Wright is working closely with the chair, Interior Secretary [Doug] Burgum, and other council members to unleash American energy through permitting reform. Make no mistake, the prior administration’s war on coal and neglect of nuclear energy are over,” he said.

Haustveit said the administration will also “unleash” another base load resource, natural gas.

“We are on the cusp of an LNG revolution that will fill the world with our LNG bounty. Several of the LNG export authorizations processed during the first Trump administration have now become actual exports, including the Plaquemines LNG project right here in Louisiana that has just come online,” said Haustveit.

The leasing act requires companies to pay fair market value for coal mined on public lands.
The other tract, with 5 million tons of coal, was a proposed expansion of an existing lease held.
Three other coal lease sales from public lands were successful under Trump.
Wolverine Fuels, Warrior Met Coal Mining and Navajo Transitional Energy Co. export some of their coal.","BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — U.S. officials rejected a mining company’s bid for more than 6 million tons of coal beneath a national forest in Utah, marking the third proposed coal sale from public lands in the West to fall through this month, the Interior Department disclosed Thursday.

The failed sales mark a setback in Republican President Donald Trump’s push to revive a coal mining industry that’s been in decline for almost two decades. Emissions from burning coal are a leading driver of climate change that’s raising sea levels and making weather more extreme.

The Interior Department rejected the sole bid it received for two tracts of federal coal on the Manti-La Sal National Forest because it did not meet the requirements of the Mineral Leasing Act, agency spokesperson Alyse Sharpe said.

The leasing act requires companies to pay fair market value for coal mined on public lands. Sharpe declined to say how much was bid.

The coal tracts near central Utah’s Skyline Mine were requested by a subsidiary of Wolverine Fuels LLC, which operates Skyline and two other active coal mines in the area, employing 950 people, according to its website. The Associated Press left voicemails and electronic messages seeking comment from the company.

The Interior Department’s Bureau of Land Management offered a lease on one tract, with 1.3 million tons of coal, during an Oct. 1 competitive sale. The other tract, with 5 million tons of coal, was a proposed expansion of an existing lease held. The rejected bid covered both tracts, Sharpe said.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said two weeks ago that the government will open 13 million acres of federal lands for coal mining. But it’s unclear who would want that fuel as utilities turn to cheaper natural gas and renewables such as wind and solar to generate electricity.

On Oct. 6, a coal sale from public lands in Montana that would have been the largest by the government in more than a decade drew a single bid of $186,000, or about one-tenth of a penny per ton of coal, and was later rejected. That lease held 167 million tons of coal in southeastern Montana near the Navajo Transition Energy Co.’s Spring Creek mine.

Two days later the Interior Department postponed an even bigger sale — 440 million tons next to the Navajo Nation-owned company’s Antelope Mine in Wyoming.

Sharpe repeated the Trump administration’s assertion that the policies of former Presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama were to blame for the failed sales, saying they tried “to dismantle domestic production and shake investor confidence in the industry.”

Both Democrats attempted to curb sales of coal from public lands, only to have those policies reversed by Trump.

Three other coal lease sales from public lands were successful under Trump. The largest, in Alabama, involved 54 million tons of higher quality coal used in steelmaking that Warrior Met Coal Mining bought for $46 million, or about 87 cents per ton. Two recent sales in North Dakota of leases containing a combined 30 million tons of coal brought in $186,000 total, or less than a penny per ton.

“As demand for reliable, dispatchable power grows, coal remains a critical component of ensuring affordable and dependable energy for the American people,” Sharpe said in a statement.

Industry analysts and economists say the biggest driver of coal’s retreat has been market forces that make other energy sources more economical. Many coal plants served by large mines on public lands in the West are nearing retirement.

Environmentalists fought for years against the expansion of Utah’s Skyline Mine. Emma Yip with the Center for Biological Diversity described the bid rejection as “yet another face-plant for the Trump administration” as it tries to prop up a dying industry.

“Coal is among the dirtiest energy sources on Earth and burning it continues to sicken and kill Americans. There’s no defensible reason to keep it on life support when absolutely nobody wants it,” Yip said.

Shrinking coal demand in the U.S. has prompted mining companies to seek out customers overseas, including in Asia where consumption has continued to rise. Wolverine Fuels, Warrior Met Coal Mining and Navajo Transitional Energy Co. export some of their coal.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright said during a Thursday conference call with reporters that coal remains the largest source of electricity globally and predicted that U.S. exports of the fuel would increase. Prior efforts to boost exports were hobbled by a lack of U.S. port capacity.

Arizona’s attorney general, Kris Mayes, said the cancellation of the program would affect 900,000 low-income households nationwide.
A second suit will seek reinstatement of the program and is expected to be filed later on Thursday in federal court in Washington state, Bonta’s statement said.
“The Trump administration is trying to hold us in the past, tethered to fossil fuel companies,” he said in the online call.
The complaints come 10 days after a group of solar companies and labor unions also sued to restore the program.","Nearly two dozen states are suing the Trump administration over its cancellation of a $7bn grant program aimed at expanding solar energy in low-income communities, according to court papers.

In a statement on Thursday, California’s attorney general, Rob Bonta, announced two lawsuits by a group of states that received grants under the Environmental Protection Agency’s Solar for All program. The EPA’s administrator, Lee Zeldin, announced the termination of the program in August. The agency said in an email that it would not comment on pending litigation.

Arizona’s attorney general, Kris Mayes, said the cancellation of the program would affect 900,000 low-income households nationwide. Some 11,000 low-income households in Arizona will see a 20% spike in energy bills after the state lost $156m for Solar for All.

The lawsuit is among dozens the country’s 23 Democratic attorneys general have filed against the Trump administration on issues ranging from suspension of federal grants to immigration and deployment of national guard troops to cities. “Without this program, for many Arizonans, clean energy will be out of reach,” Mayes said in an online call.

The first complaint seeks monetary damages and was filed on Wednesday in the court of federal claims. A second suit will seek reinstatement of the program and is expected to be filed later on Thursday in federal court in Washington state, Bonta’s statement said.

California will lose around $250m in congressionally obligated funds for the program, Bonta said.

“The Trump administration is trying to hold us in the past, tethered to fossil fuel companies,” he said in the online call. “In doing so, Trump is making America more expensive and more polluted.” The One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed into law by Donald Trump in July eliminated the source of funding for a program Zeldin termed a “boondoggle”. The president has rolled back federal support for solar and wind energy, calling the renewable resources expensive and unreliable.

Mayes said the program’s cancellation would hit disadvantaged communities, citing the Hopi tribe of northern Arizona, which was slated to get a $25m award to bring electricity, often for the first time, to hundreds of homes using solar panels and battery storage systems.

The complaints come 10 days after a group of solar companies and labor unions also sued to restore the program.

In addition to California and Arizona, states participating in the lawsuits include Maryland, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin, and the city of Washington DC.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75bbc39da9582cc247cabe50c239037b3152ebc4/891_0_4453_3563/master/4453.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3c49e1a8f7fc667d3f7231f5464312e7",N,,2025-10-16 20:07:40.101028

The loan guarantee to AEP was among those conditionally approved under Biden, a fact Wright acknowledged to reporters.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Department of Energy said Thursday it has finalized a $1.6 billion loan guarantee to a subsidiary of one of the nation’s largest power companies to upgrade nearly 5,000 miles of transmission lines across five states, mostly in the Midwest, for largely fossil fuel-run energy.

AEP Transmission will upgrade power lines in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia to enhance enhance grid reliability and capacity, the Energy Department said. The project, first offered under the Biden administration, is meant to help meet surging electricity demand from data centers and artificial intelligence.

Ohio-based American Electric Power, which owns AEP Transmission, is one of the nation’s largest utilities, serving 5.6 million customers in 11 states. It primarily produces electricity from coal, natural gas and nuclear power, along with renewable resources such as wind and hydroelectric power.

Thursday’s announcement deepens the Trump administration’s commitment to traditional, polluting energy sources even as it works to discourage the U.S. from clean energy use.

Earlier this month, the administration cancelled $7.6 billion in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election. A total of 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable, the Energy Department said.

The cancellations include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub aimed at developing clean-burning hydrogen fuels to power ships and heavy-duty trucks. A hydrogen project costing up to $1 billion in the Pacific Northwest also was cancelled.

The loan guarantee finalized Thursday is the first offered by the Trump administration under the recently renamed Energy Dominance Financing program created by the massive tax-and-spending law approved this summer by congressional Republicans and signed by President Donald Trump. Electric utilities that receive loans through the program must provide assurances to the government that financial benefits from the financing will be passed on to customers, the Energy Department said.

The project and others being considered will help ensure that Americans “will have access to affordable, reliable and secure energy for decades to come,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement.

“The president has been clear: America must reverse course from the energy subtraction agenda of past administrations and strengthen our electrical grid,” Wright said, adding that modernizing the grid and expanding transmission capacity “will help position the United States to win the AI race and grow our manufacturing base.”

The upgrades supported by the federal financing will replace existing transmission lines in existing rights-of-way with new lines capable of carrying more energy, the power company said.

More than 2,000 miles of transmission lines in Ohio serving 1.5 million people will be replaced, along with more than 1,400 miles in Indiana and Michigan serving 600,000 customers, the company said. An additional 1,400 miles in Oklahoma, serving about 1.2 million people and 26 miles in West Virginia, serving 460,000 people, will be replaced.

The projects will create about 1,100 construction jobs, the company said.

The loan guarantee will save customers money and improve reliability while supporting economic growth in the five states, said Bill Fehrman, AEP’s chairman, president and chief executive officer. “The funds we will save through this program enable us to make additional investments to enhance service for our customers,” he added.

Wright, in a conference call with reporters, distinguished the AEP loan guarantee from a $4.9 billion federal loan guarantee the department cancelled in July. That money would have boosted the planned Grain Belt Express, a new high-voltage transmission line set to deliver solar and wind-generated electricity from the Midwest to eastern states.

The Energy Department said at the time it was “not critical for the federal government to have a role” in the first phase of the $11 billion project planned by Chicago-based Invenergy. The department also questioned whether the project could meet strict financial conditions required, a claim Wright repeated Thursday.

“Ultimately that is a commercial enterprise that needs private developers,” Wright said. The company has indicated the Grain Belt project will go forward.

Trump and Wright have repeatedly derided wind and solar energy as unreliable and opposed efforts to combat climate change by moving away from fossil fuels. Wright said the Grain Belt Express loan was among billions of dollars worth of commitments “rushed out the door” in the waning days of former President Joe Biden’s administration.

The loan guarantee to AEP was among those conditionally approved under Biden, a fact Wright acknowledged to reporters.

“Not all of the (Biden-era) projects were nonsense,” he said, adding that he was “happy to move forward” with the transmission upgrade.",https://www.cbs17.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/29/2025/10/68f1596aaf5964.37025027.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-16 20:11:52.030925

,North Carolina American Energy ,2025-10-16 22:36:23+00:00,Raleigh News & Observer,NC attorney general sues Trump administration over canceled rooftop solar grants,Martha Quillin,,,,,https://www.newsobserver.com/news/state/north-carolina/article312530659.html,"Solar power with battery storage is one of the cleanest and least polluting sources of energy.
In North Carolina, the program is administered by the state Department of Environmental Quality, which calls its version EnergizeNC.
North Carolina applied for $250 million in grants and in 2024 received more than $156 million to be used over five years.
The money also would have helped support the burgeoning solar power industry in the state, whose more than 200 businesses have more than 9,000 employees.
“Thousands of families were going to have the option to install solar power, save money, and have another energy option after a major storm.","North Carolina and 22 other states sued President Donald Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency Thursday, claiming it had illegally canceled more than $7 billion in grants meant to help install solar power in low-income and rural areas.

N.C. Attorney General Jeff Jackson joined the suit on behalf of the state, which had secured $150 million in grants through the Solar for All program when Trump’s EPA chief announced the funding would be canceled. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin made the announcement in a social media post in August in which he called Solar for All “a boondoggle.”

Solar for All is an initiative of the Biden administration’s “Investing in America” agenda and was funded by Congress through the Inflation Reduction Act, which created EPA’s $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.

Clean-energy advocates have long said the United States must reduce its reliance on fossil fuels to slow climate change, reduce carbon emissions and lower energy costs. Solar power with battery storage is one of the cleanest and least polluting sources of energy.

A solar collection system can be designed and installed in a few months on sunny rooftops, exterior walls and open spaces. Large, centralized power plants that rely on coal, gas or nuclear power can take years to build or expand.

While rooftop solar can save a family or business money over the long run, up-front installation costs can be a deterrent. That’s where Solar for All was designed to help, by giving grants to states, territories, tribal governments, municipalities and nonprofits across the country. In North Carolina, the program is administered by the state Department of Environmental Quality, which calls its version EnergizeNC.

A coalition including the NC Clean Energy Technology Center at N.C. State University, the NC Clean Energy Fund, and Advanced Energy has been working with DEQ to determine how best to use the money.

North Carolina applied for $250 million in grants and in 2024 received more than $156 million to be used over five years. Some of that had been drawn down when Zeldin announced the cancellation of the program. Those working with EnergizeNC said the money would have helped more than 12,000 households in the state save an average of 20% on their utility bills. The money also would have helped support the burgeoning solar power industry in the state, whose more than 200 businesses have more than 9,000 employees.

“These funds were going to help low-income and rural North Carolinians save money on their energy bills,” Jackson said in a press release. “Thousands of families were going to have the option to install solar power, save money, and have another energy option after a major storm. Now the EPA has illegally cancelled those funds — so I’m going to court to bring $150 million back to our state.”

Reid Wilson, secretary of NCDEQ, said, “Rooftop solar drives down utility bills, reduces air pollution and creates jobs. The program’s cancellation would hurt the electric grid’s ability to be resilient to future disasters, and would hamper North Carolina’s efforts to ensure reliable, clean and affordable energy supplies to meet the needs of a rapidly growing population and rising energy demand.”

Jackson said the EPA unilaterally cancelled all grant agreements in the program, leaving North Carolina without more than $150 million of the $156 million it had been awarded. He said the EPA notified all recipients, including North Carolina, that there was no longer any “statutory basis or dedicated funding” for Solar for All, though the cancellation was not approved by Congress, which had approved the original funding.

“In fact,” Jackson said, “Congress did the opposite by only rescinding unawarded Solar for All funds when it passed the BBB (Big Beautiful Bill). The grants were abruptly cancelled without a valid legal basis, and the attorneys general are suing to win back this money that is legally due to North Carolina and other states.”

Jackson and the other states filed the complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington. The suit claims the EPA violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the U.S. Constitution’s Separation of Powers Doctrine by unlawfully canceling Solar for All.

Jackson also joined states in a second lawsuit in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims arguing that EPA breached the clear terms of the agreements and violated the duty of good faith and fair dealing in canceling their Solar for All grants.",https://www.newsobserver.com/public/latest-news/cd68s8/picture312532595/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/ncsu%20clean%20energy%20technology%20center.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 20:11:58.581638

The Bill includes measures to implement this year’s Budget announcements to extend the vehicle registration tax (VRT) relief and benefit in kind (BIK) relief for electric vehicles.

It is proposed that the VRT relief will be extended to 31 December 2026 and the BIK relief for cars and vans will be extended to 31 December 2028, although the additional discount to original market value (OMV) for BIK purposes will taper down from €10,000 in the 2026 tax year to €5,000 in the 2027 tax year, and to €2,500 in the 2028 tax year.

The Bill also proposes to introduce a new vehicle category A1 for zero carbon emission cars and this new category of cars will attract a lower BIK cost of between 6 and 15 percent of the OMV of the car depending on the business mileage in the year.

Energy efficient equipment & capital allowances

As announced by the minister in his Budget speech, it is proposed that the schemes for accelerated capital allowances available in respect of certain energy efficient equipment, gas and hydrogen vehicles used for the purposes of carrying on a trade will be extended to 31 December 2030.

This is very much in alignment with the EU Clean Industrial Deal which has promoted the use of accelerated capital allowances and tax credits to incentivise investment into energy efficient and green energy expenditure.

Interest limitation rules – exemption for certain large scale assets

In an unexpected move, it is proposed that the scope of the current exemption from the interest limitation regime which applies to providing, upgrading, operating or maintaining certain large scale assets (such as renewable energy installations, strategic housing developments and public-private partnership (PPP) roads) where relevant conditions are met will be extended to include electricity transmission infrastructure developments, strategic gas infrastructure developments, strategic infrastructure developments and large-scale residential developments, as defined in the Planning and Development Act 2024 where a decision to grant permission for that development has been made under that Act.

This encompasses a broad range of infrastructure assets such as transmission lines, substations and switching stations, electricity interconnectors, downstream gas pipelines, surface storage of natural gas, natural gas terminals, waste-water treatment plants, waste incinerators, certain harbour and port installations, thermal power stations and certain healthcare infrastructure.

Dubbed the FastSites program, the initiative is backed by $150 million from a Site Investment and Infrastructure Fund state lawmakers approved earlier this year, according to the Louisiana Economic Development agency.

FastSites relies on participation from local governments, nonprofit groups, development authorities and private landowners who can apply and compete for the funding. The allocations from the fund will be structured as forgivable loans or a partnership deal with the state.

The money can be used to purchase tracts of land and partially develop it by, for example, demolishing old buildings, clearing trees, providing road and rail access or upgrading utility connections to the site.

“This is one of the most forward-thinking site development models in the country,” LED Chief Economic Competitiveness Officer Ileana Ledet said in a news release. “FastSites aligns government efficiency with private-sector speed, ensuring Louisiana can meet the demands of global investment while strengthening our communities and infrastructure.”

The funding awards will range from a minimum of $1 million to as much as $25 million. Applicants must match the funding by as much as 50% to 80%, depending on the project type. Private landowners who qualify for the funding will have higher matching requirements and won’t be eligible for future loan forgiveness, according to LED.

The application period for the inaugural round of funding opens Oct. 30 and closes Dec. 15.

Städer kämpar med översvämningar, nationalparker förlorar glaciärer och djurlivsmiljöer, stränder eroderar och den arktiska vildmarken är hotad. Dessa effekter omformar ekosystem, äventyrar samhällen och hotar både naturliga och kulturella landmärken, vilket gör det tydligt att klimatförändringarna inte längre är en avlägsen oro utan en aktuell verklighet i hela landet.

Över hela USA brottas några av landets mest kända destinationer med de eskalerande effekterna av klimatförändringarna. Från dynamiska kuststäder till hisnande nationalparker omdefinierar stigande havsnivåer, extremt väder och miljöförstöring landskapen, försörjningsmöjligheterna och kulturskatterna i dessa regioner.

Miami, Florida, känt för sitt energiska nattliv, solkyssta stränder och mångfaldiga samhällen, står inför ett alltmer akut hot. Prognoser tyder på att havsnivåerna kan stiga med så mycket som 1,8 meter fram till år 2100, vilket potentiellt kan översvämma stora delar av staden. Även idag orsakar högvatten ""soliga dagsöversvämningar"", vilket tillfälligt förvandlar gator till vattenvägar. Trots pågående investeringar i infrastrukturförbättringar är Miamis framtid fortfarande osäker, och stadens ekonomi och kulturella vitalitet hänger i en våg om inte djärva klimatåtgärder vidtas.

New Orleans, Louisiana, står inför en förvärrad utmaning med sjunkande land och återkommande kraftiga stormar. Vissa områden i staden fortsätter att sjunka i alarmerande takt, vilket gör stadsdelar alltmer utsatta för översvämningar och orkaner. Även om översvämningsskydd har förstärkts tidigare, är stadens distinkta kulturella identitet – inklusive dess musik, mat och traditioner – fortfarande i fara. New Orleans exemplifierar sårbarheten hos låglänta stadscentra i en varmare värld.

I norra Klippiga bergen upplever Montanas Glacier National Park ett snabbt försvinnande av sina namngivna glaciärer. Mer än 80 % av parkens glaciärer har smält sedan slutet av 1800-talet, och experter varnar för att den återstående isen kan försvinna inom det kommande decenniet. Denna reträtt påverkar flodsystem, djurlivsmiljöer och parkens ikoniska vyer, vilket utmanar bevarandeinsatser och hotar den ekologiska balansen som lockar miljontals besökare varje år.

På östkusten kämpar Cape Hatteras i North Carolina med obeveklig erosion längs kusterna. Vissa sträckor av kusten förlorar upp till 15 meter sand årligen, vilket äventyrar både stränder och historiska landmärken. Även om strandrestaureringsprojekt har gett tillfällig lindring är den långsiktiga livskraften för denna pittoreska kustlinje osäker i takt med att havsnivåerna stiger och stormarna intensifieras.

San Francisco, Kalifornien, står inför överlappande hot från stigande tidvatten och jordbävningar. Låglänta områden och kustområden förväntas översvämmas under högvatten i mitten av århundradet, samtidigt som den ständigt närvarande risken för en större seismisk händelse tornar upp sig. Stadens unika karaktär, ikoniska landmärken och ekonomiska vitalitet utmanas alla av dessa sammanhängande hot, trots pågående åtgärder för att motstå motståndskraft.

Florida Keys, en kedja av tropiska öar, är alltmer sårbara för stigande havsnivåer och starkare orkaner. Dessa förändringar hotar både öarnas naturliga ekosystem och lokala ekonomier, som är starkt beroende av turism och fiske. Studier tyder på att betydande delar av Keys kan vara under vatten år 2040, vilket understryker det akuta behovet av proaktiva anpassningsstrategier.

Yellowstone nationalpark i Wyoming upplever ökade risker för skogsbränder på grund av stigande temperaturer. Mer frekventa och allvarliga bränder påverkar djurlivet, förändrar landskap och stör den naturliga geotermiska aktiviteten. Dessa miljöpåverkan hotar parkens ekologiska mångfald och den upplevelse som lockar besökare från hela världen.

Chesapeake Bay, som sträcker sig över Maryland och Virginia, står inför miljöpåverkan från föroreningar, överfiske, förlust av livsmiljöer och stigande vatten. Erosion av kustlinjer och våtmarker hotar både djurlivet och lokalsamhällena. Medan restaureringsarbetet fortsätter är vikens långsiktiga hälsa fortfarande osäker, vilket belyser de bredare svårigheter som kustekosystem står inför över hela landet.

Hawaiis korallrev är under allvarlig press i takt med att havstemperaturerna stiger och försurningen ökar. Korallblekning har skadat viktiga marina livsmiljöer, vilket påverkar den biologiska mångfalden och den lokala fiske- och turistnäringen. Trots pågående bevarandeinitiativ står dessa känsliga ekosystem inför långsiktiga risker om de globala klimattrenderna fortsätter okontrollerade.

Slutligen upplever Alaskas arktiska nationella naturreservat, ett av landets sista orörda vildmarksområden, stigande temperaturer och potentiell industriell expansion. Förändringar i vilda djurs migrationsmönster och hot mot arters överlevnad äventyrar både den naturliga miljön och ursprungsbefolkningarna. Reservatets bevarande är avgörande, men dess framtid är fortfarande osäker.

Florida, Alaska, Kalifornien, Louisiana, Montana, Maryland, Virginia, Hawaii och andra amerikanska delstater upplever akuta klimatpåverkan, från stigande havsnivåer, skogsbränder och glaciärers reträtt till korallblekning, eroderande stränder och hotad arktisk vildmark, vilket omformar städer, parker och ekosystem över hela landet.

Från urbana knutpunkter till avlägsen vildmark konfronterar USA de verkliga och omedelbara konsekvenserna av klimatförändringarna. Utan ihållande och beslutsamma åtgärder står dessa ikoniska destinationer, ekosystem och samhällen inför djupgående och potentiellt oåterkalleliga förluster.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/destination-1-4.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 20:12:17.442164

FastSites relies on participation from local governments, nonprofit groups, development authorities and private landowners who can apply and compete for the funding. The allocations from the fund will be structured as forgivable loans or a partnership deal with the state.

The money can be used to purchase tracts of land and partially develop it by, for example, demolishing old buildings, clearing trees, providing road and rail access or upgrading utility connections to the site.

The funding awards will range from a minimum of $1 million to as much as $25 million. Applicants must match the funding by as much as 50% to 80%, depending on the project type. Private landowners who qualify for the funding will have higher matching requirements and won’t be eligible for future loan forgiveness, according to LED.

“Without this program, for many Arizonans, clean energy will be out of reach,” Mayes said during a virtual press conference Thursday with California Attorney General Rob Bonta.

The two lawsuits, which Mayes are co-leading, include 21 states, along with the District of Columbia, and claims the EPA acted unlawfully when it shuttered the program getting rid of $156 million in grants already established for Arizona. That included a $25 million grant to the Hopi Tribe that would have aided in the creation of solar panels and battery storage for homes on the Hopi Reservation for approximately 600 homes.

“The loss of the Solar for all Program will also make it more difficult for Arizonans to meet the expected 40% increase in energy demand,” Mayes said.

The Grand Canyon State is home to 151 data centers and counting — Arizona is No. 7 in the number of data centers nationally — which used more than 1.5 gigawatts of electricity in 2024.

Utility rates in the state have also continued to skyrocket, as customers with Arizona Public Service are anticipated to see a double-digit increase in their rates starting next year, with concerns that Arizona’s booming data center economy could make matters worse for consumers.

At the heart of the lawsuit is Trump’s $3.4 trillion deficit-boosting tax cut and spending package, H.R. 1, also known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill.” It fulfills a number of his administration’s domestic policy priorities, including a major reversal on clean energy initiatives.

This is the second lawsuit this week that Arizona has taken a party to as the states have claimed that the EPA breached their contracts by cancelling the program.

“Despite Congress’s express decision to rescind only ‘unobligated balances,’ the EPA interpreted H.R. 1 as somehow rescinding all appropriations related to Solar for All,” the lawsuit says. “Not only erroneous as a matter of statutory interpretation, but the EPA’s view is also erroneous as a matter of contract law: the EPA’s interpretation of H.R. 1 does not constitute grounds for termination under the express terms and conditions of the Grant Agreements.”

The lawsuits are number 43 and 44 for the state of California against the Trump administration in 38 weeks — “more than one a week,” noted Bonta.

“Terminating Solar for All is unlawful,” Bonta said. “We will see the administration in court again.”

Due to the cuts made by Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” to programs like Solar for All and other clean energy initiatives, Arizonans will have until the end of year to take advantage of the 30% federal tax credit — an average of $9,000 in savings — to install solar panels.

The credit, which was created in 2022 by the Inflation Reduction Act, was originally set to expire in July 2036, but Trump’s budget bill takes specific aim at a number of clean energy initiatives included in the IRA, which was one of President Joe Biden’s key legislative victories.

In Arizona, energy efficiency is key to homeowners during the summer months and can curb energy bills, which are increasing for many people as the impacts of climate change are leading to intensely high temperatures.

The cuts also are estimated to cost the state approximately $58 billion and 69,000 jobs due to the loss of many projects, according to the Arizona Commerce Authority.",https://azmirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/solarpanelworker2025-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 19:10:30.401082

1’s drastically shortened availability timeline for the 45V Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit.","H.R. 1, the so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill” Act (OBBBA), enacted on July 4, 2025, expands the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit (45Z) by extending it through 2029 and loosening eligibility requirements associated with transportation fuels’ carbon intensity (CI). Simultaneously, amendments to the 45Z credit within H.R. 1 dramatically reduce the maximum per-gallon credit value available to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) producers: from $1.75/gallon to $1.00/gallon. Together, these and other changes to 45Z are expected to: (1) cost taxpayers $25.7 billion from FY25-34 (despite repealing the higher credit value for SAF), (2) expand tax credits for conventional biofuels that already benefit from other federal support and have limited greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction potential, and (3) limit federal incentives for domestic production of innovative fuels like SAF. 45Z as modified will not decrease GHG emissions of domestic fuel or promote production of domestic clean fuels.

Background

Congress created 45Z in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022. The IRA set the maximum credit value at $1.00/gallon for eligible clean fuels, which included those with a CI of less than 50 kg CO2e/mmBTU produced in calendar years 2025-2027. Additionally, SAF was granted a higher maximum credit value of $1.75/gallon. Congress also required the tax credit to be adjusted annually for inflation. Fuels that earned other tax credits, like 45V (hydrogen production) or 45Q (carbon sequestration), were not allowed to stack these credits with 45Z. When the IRA was passed, the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimated that the 45Z credit (in place from 2025-2027) would cost about $2.9 billion over FY25-28.

The IRA made other changes to federal biofuel tax credits, including eliminating the biomass-based diesel credit, the second-generation biofuel credit, and other alternative fuel tax credits with the intent of replacing them with the technology-neutral 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit. In addition, the IRA created the standalone 40B SAF tax credit, available in calendar years 2023-2024 (i.e., the two-year period before 45Z became operative). Fuels that reduced lifecycle GHG emissions by at least 50% could earn a credit of $1.25/gallon, up to $1.75/gallon on a sliding scale for each percent reduction in GHG emissions. Beginning in 2025, 40B was folded into 45Z, maintaining the maximum rate for SAF of $1.75/gallon.

Table 1: IRA fuel tax credits

Significant H.R. 1 Amendments to 45Z

One of the most significant changes to 45Z within H.R. 1 is a provision excluding emissions associated with indirect land use change (ILUC) from a fuel’s CI score. Ignoring ILUC can decrease CI scores of certain land-intensive conventional biofuels like corn ethanol and soy biodiesel by ignoring up to 20-25 g CO2e/MJ, yielding higher per-gallon tax credits for these fuels. ILUC-related GHG emissions are generated from land use conversion (e.g., clearing grasslands or forests – releasing carbon in the process – to replace food production on lands converted to biofuel crops) and other market-mediated effects not directly related to the biofuel crop. ILUC-related GHG emissions of biofuels derived from feedstocks that do not require dedicated land, such as agricultural and forestry residues and wastes, or feedstocks that may improve land systems (e.g., winter crops on seasonally fallow land, perennials on marginal land) may be more favorable and may be indirectly affected by this change if it encourages the continued reliance on conventional biofuel feedstocks.

In addition, H.R. 1 stripped the special SAF rate of $1.75/gallon, dropping it to $1.00/gallon to match all other clean fuels. This modification limits the incentive for domestic investment in new or expanded SAF facilities. SAF is still expensive to produce, as it is a nascent industry, and requires more support than other clean fuels to reach commercial scale. Many SAF producers factored the $1.75/gallon credit value into their business models and are now facing serious risks to investment and production capacity with the newly lowered credit value. SAF production facilities are currently positioned in states ranging from California to Montana with expansion planned in the West, South, Northwest, and Midwest in coming years. However, it is not clear how much of the planned expansion will proceed, as project developers around the country reckon with these changes.

The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimated that the new 45Z, including H.R. 1 changes, will cost taxpayers $25.7 billion through its expiration in 2029. When the IRA was passed, JCT estimated that 45Z would cost about $2.9 billion over four years. The significant expansion in cost from the 2022 estimate to the 2025 estimate is not tied to an increase inpublic benefits (such as reduced emissions); rather, the order-of-magnitude increase in cost results from Congress’s decisions to weaken the law’s carbon accounting requirements and allow a broader set of conventional biofuel producers to claim the credit.

Table 2: Summary of 45Z modifications in H.R. 1 compared to the IRA

Impacts of 45Z Modifications

The changes made to 45Z will cost taxpayers more while undermining U.S. competitiveness, innovation, and climate progress.

H.R. 1 changes to 45Z will benefit:

Domestic corn ethanol and soy biodiesel industries, with more gallons of current conventional biofuel production eligible for the tax credit at higher per-gallon tax credit rates compared to those under the IRA version of 45Z, mainly due to the new version’s directive against counting ILUC emissions. Increased production of corn ethanol and soy biodiesel could occur at the margin due to 45Z incentives, but domestic corn ethanol consumption growth is constrained by infrastructure, limited purchases of high-ethanol fuel blends, and flat or declining gasoline consumption nationwide. The corn ethanol industry could experience growth if domestic alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) fuel production scales, however the new 45Z disincentivizes this industry, which is still in early stages of development. Even without significant volumetric growth, these industries will benefit from higher per-gallon subsidies.

Soy-based renewable diesel production is especially likely to benefit from higher per-gallon tax credits. As a mature and expanding industry, soy-based renewable diesel does not need taxpayer funding. Biodiesel and renewable diesel are also more expensive than diesel fuel, so unless oil prices increase significantly, production will likely be dictated largely by existing biofuel policies mandating a certain level of consumption each year, such as the federal Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS), not by the availability of 45Z credits. As a result, taxpayer dollars are not actually needed to incentivize production of these fuels, making changes to 45Z a windfall for conventional biofuels.

H.R. 1 changes to 45Z will disadvantage:

Taxpayers, since billions of dollars are expected to be spent annually on duplicative tax credits for carbon-intensive, mature biofuels that would be produced anyway under policies like the RFS and LCFS, which already mandate biofuel consumption. 45Z’s expansion and extension is unlikely on its own to spur additional job growth or economic investment in new production facilities nationwide.

Industry investment in innovative fuel production, including companies investing in high-paying jobs across the country to produce fuels for growing markets such as SAF and fuels utilizing clean hydrogen to produce clean ammonia, methanol, etc.

U.S. competitiveness and economic growth, since financial incentives will be shifted toward existing, mature industries like soy-based renewable diesel – an inefficient use of taxpayer dollars – instead of toward new, innovative fuels that generate significant economic growth, business investment, and international investment opportunities.

U.S. positioning as a global leader in SAF production, because companies will likely shift planned SAF investments to other countries, given the decreased financial incentives for domestic SAF production and uncertainty around federal policy.

Climate and environment, with less stringent carbon intensity reduction requirements for 45Z-eligible fuels and less funding directed at much-needed clean alternatives like SAF. The statute no longer requires consideration of the emissions resulting from the potential conversion of carbon-rich land like forests and wetlands which could occur withincreased corn- and soybean-based biofuel production. The production of conventional biofuels now subsidized by 45Z is also associated with worse water, air, and soil quality and diminished wildlife habitat.

Issues to Watch

With statutory changes to 45Z included in H.R. 1, the next step is for the U.S. Treasury and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to issue new guidance relating to the implementation of those statutory changes. Some issues to watch over the coming months include:

How the removal of ILUC considerations within 45Z carbon intensity scores will be implemented at Treasury/IRS.

Whether and how Treasury/IRS or Argonne National Lab’s GREET model will incorporate certain farming methods (known as Climate Smart Agriculture, or CSA) such as no-till farming into CI scoring for 45Z. This is generally a way for biofuels to reduce their CI scores. There is a lot of uncertainty around the impacts of certain CSA practices, while others can be accurately estimated. Depending on the type of CSA practices that are credited, the implementation of those practices, and their incorporation into CI scores, the environmental benefits of biofuels could be improved or further eroded. Nothing in H.R. 1 authorizes Treasury to reduce a fuel’s carbon intensity score based on CSA practices. The biofuel industry has advocated for their broad inclusion in 45Z. CATF supports the inclusion of highly certain practices with quantifiable impacts, such as enhanced nitrogen efficiency fertilizers and reduced fertilizer use.

Final Renewable Volume Obligations issued by the Environmental Protection Agency for calendar years 2026 and 2027, which will dictate U.S. biofuel consumption as part of the RFS mandate. In June 2025, EPA proposed significantly higher mandates for biomass-based diesel consumption for 2025 and 2026.

Investment in clean, innovative fuels such as SAF, methanol, and ammonia with 45Z SAF tax credit maximum value reduced by 43% in H.R. 1. SAF production expansion announcements across the U.S. may also be affected by H.R. 1’s drastically shortened availability timeline for the 45V Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit.

U.S. fuels policy should support innovative fuels to reduce emissions and grow the U.S. economy. H.R. 1’s changes to 45Z fail to deliver either of those objectives. Instead, they will cost taxpayers billions to subsidize mature industries with limited public benefit.",https://cdn.catf.us/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/02115443/airplane-runway-web.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 19:10:52.040270

EV owners displayed 46 different models, ranging from a first-generation Nissan Leaf to a 2026 Hyundai Ioniq 9, and from electric motorcycles to a brand-new VW ID. Buzz microbus. Two of the most talked-about exhibits were a 1969 Subaru minibus converted to electric power and a 2025 Dodge EV Daytona Charger.

Thanks to support from the Ventura County Regional Energy Alliance, the Ventura Unified School District brought one of its electric buses to the event, with the driver on hand to answer questions.

Also on display were three Tesla Cybertrucks, including one owned by the event organizer and EV Advocates field representative, Kent Bullard.

Unfazed by the end of federal subsidies, Bullard said he believes that rising gas prices, a growing public charging network and an ever-wider variety of EV models will sustain strong demand.

When asked whether large, powerful EVs might undermine the environmental message of efficiency and conservation, Bullard offered a measured response.

“If people were to buy a Rivian R1S or Cybertruck instead of a gas-burning Suburban or Expedition, that’s a step forward,” he said.

Smaller, lighter vehicles remain the greener option for most drivers, but Bullard’s broader point is clear: electric vehicle technology now spans nearly every transportation need, from compact commuters to long-range haulers.

To demonstrate that EVs can truly “go the distance,” Bullard and another advocate towed their travel trailers to the Ventura Harbor event. Bullard’s 4,000-mile summer road trip with his trailer underscored the increasing practicality of long-distance electric travel.

The local push for EV adoption continues on multiple fronts.

In Camarillo, Tesla has been building two new Supercharger sites. The location on the west side of the outlet mall is already live, featuring 20, 325 kW chargers. A second station with 24 chargers at Camarillo Plaza is awaiting utility connection. Additionally, two dual-head Level 2 chargers are being installed near the Camarillo Family YMCA, and a 30-unit project at CSU Channel Islands is delayed pending infrastructure upgrades.

In Thousand Oaks, Cal State Northridge has installed 46 Level 2 chargers at Montclef and Olsen roads. A new site at Cho Cho San, 400 E. Thousand Oaks Blvd., will include two DC fast chargers and three Level 2 units.

Federal subsidies may be winding down, but Ventura County’s growing charging infrastructure and grassroots advocacy efforts continue to drive electric momentum—proving that local action, not just national policy, powers long-term environmental progress.

Where the market stands

The U.S. sold about 1.3 million electric vehicles in 2024, a record-high number. Still, EVs remain less than 10% of new vehicle registrations.

Through the first half of 2025, cumulative electric vehicle sales in the U.S. totaled just over 568,000 units, up roughly 1.6 % from the same period a year earlier. The end of the federal subsidies could slow growth in the fourth quarter compared to earlier ones, but if sales accelerate in Q4, the current year could beat 2024.

The EV market in 2025 is not uniformly strong—growth is concentrated among certain automakers and models. Kia’s electric vehicle sales dropped 54 % in the first half of 2025 vs. 2024. Mercedes’ EV sales also came under pressure. Tesla remains the largest single seller.

Applications re-open every year during autumn to ensure that they are prepared for the cool weather during the winter months.

As of October 1, 2025, Indiana residents can apply for IndyEAP benefits worth around $400.

It’s the state’s Energy Assistance Program, which provides a financial cushion for income-eligible households within Marion County to keep utility services up and running.

Marion County predominantly surrounds the city of Indianapolis.

Applications can be filled out on the IndyEAP website, and only three criteria must be met to be eligible for a direct payment.

First, the Marion County residency must be met, with a ZIP code for the primary residence of an applicant being within the county limits.

Secondly, they must also be a US citizen, US national, or qualified non-citizen to get funds.

And lastly, IndyEAP requires that the last three months of household income for all persons 18 and older be reported in the application.

Those income levels must be less than certain set amounts.

For example, a one person household would need to have not made over $8,389 in the three-month span, and a household of eight must not make more than $22,263 during the same period.

DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED

IndyEAP also notes that applications should not submit photo IDs, Social Security cards, copies of apartment lease agreements, or copies of birth certificates in the application process as they are no longer required.

The only necessary documents are a signed application, recent proof of income documents, and a utility bill.

Applications can be submitted through April 20, 2026 and are expected to take about 55 days to process.

After approval, it could take another 60 days for the utility provider get them.

Those who already applied and are eligible can expect their benefits to be sent to their utility provider starting November 1.

On December 1, the moratorium protection period begins as well, meaning that those who applied for IndyEAP before then are protected from disconnection until March 15, 2026.

It’s also important to note that IndyEAP only assists with electric and gas bills, not water bills.

Several other states have also been offering energy assistance payments this month through their own programs.

NOT ALONE

In North Dakota, for example, residents can get funds worth up to $1,100 as of October 1 thanks to the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP).

LIHEAP is federally funded but carried out at a state level, and North Dakota obtained more than $23 million in funding this year.

The one-time distributions will go out until May 31, 2026, for eligible applications who have income levels at or below 60% of the state median.

Applications can be submitted online or by mail through the North Dakota Health and Human services website.

And projects from wind and solar projects produce little energy and, usually, unproductive, often temporary jobs. Increasing productivity is the key to economic growth and raising living standards, and these projects don’t fit the bill.

Clean Energy Economy Minnesota recently released its annual jobs report for clean energy fields. MPRNews reports the findings, in brief:

Its latest report released Wednesday estimates that number grew to almost 64,000 in 2024, a 2.6 percent increase from the previous year. Jobs in clean energy-related fields grew more than two times faster than the state’s total workforce.

Of note is that the “two times faster” is only 2.6 percent, while the overall economy in Minnesota grew one percent. This is not necessarily the behavior of an economic engine. American Experiment has covered the same report over several years (2017, 2019, 2020). The 2018 numbers counted 61,047 total jobs, and in 2024 there is now 63,802.

Energy efficiency is 72.3% of the “clean energy” jobs

Another important point: two-thirds of the jobs that Clean Energy Economy Minnesota is counting as “clean energy” fields are not what most people would consider clean energy jobs:

About two-thirds of Minnesota’s clean energy jobs are in energy efficiency, such as upgrading heating and cooling systems, installing LED lighting or manufacturing power-saving appliances…

In fact, the fact sheet of the report finds that 46,177 jobs are “energy efficiency,” jobs, with 11,715 in “Energy STAR and Efficient Lighting,” 12,635 in “High Efficiency HVAC & Renewable H&C,” and 4,682 in “Advanced Materials.” Astonishingly, 9,580 are in “Traditional HVAC” fields.

Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning jobs would exist regardless of clean energy goals. I have to wonder how many HVAC employees consider themselves in the business of “energy efficiency.”

For comparison, 9,167 jobs, or 14.4 percent, are in the realm of “renewable energy generation,” including 5,390 in solar and 2,870 in wind. 2,099 are in “clean storage” grid jobs.

There are more jobs in traditional HVAC counted as “clean energy” jobs than the entirety of the jobs created by renewable energy generation.

Construction jobs are temporary

Those jobs that are truly in wind, solar, battery storage, and electrified transport tend to be construction jobs. As Martha Njolomole noted in 2020, “The majority of jobs in “clean energy” are temporary construction jobs that should not be counted as part of energy jobs because their overall impact on Minnesota`s economy is very short-lived.” There is nothing inherently wrong with part-time or temporary construction jobs but treating renewable energy as a panacea for long-term job creation is a misunderstanding at best.

In the most recent edition of this report, 54.7 percent of these jobs are in construction, and 10.8 percent in manufacturing. Another 16 percent are in professional services and 8.9 percent in trade.

Administration’s actions are a needed correction to the market

MPRNews continues with predictions about the fate of the clean energy industry thanks to Trump:

However, the report doesn’t reflect the effects of President Donald Trump’s tax and spending act, which Congress passed in July. It ended some tax credits for clean energy projects on Dec. 31…

As I wrote in a letter to the editor in the Wall Street Journal:

The reconciliation bill doesn’t remove tax credits retroactively, and phaseouts won’t start for several years. Projects still qualify if they produce electricity by the end of 2027 or by 2030 if they begin construction by next summer. If wind and solar are cost-competitive, then losing tax credits shouldn’t “strand capital previously invested in projects that won’t now come online.” That developers expect to abandon projects without taxpayer dollars shows that 30 years of subsidies have merely shifted costs to taxpayers.

Projects that start by next summer and wrap up construction by 2030 could still be receiving subsidies by 2040. Subsidies drive up the costs of electricity for taxpayers, and wind and solar impose system costs through overbuilding and backup generation. Driving up electricity costs creates job losses, especially those in energy-intensive industries like mining and manufacturing.

The goal is energy, not unproductive jobs

If the industry can become economical for consumers without subsidies from the taxpayer, then the industry should look forward to building as much wind and solar as the market truly demands.

As always, the idea must be to produce energy in the most efficient ways possible, not to maximize jobs created. John Phelan noted this aptly in 2017:

The point of an energy industry is to generate energy, not to generate jobs. If it was, we could hire people to stand in front of wind turbines blowing at them to make them turn faster. The effect energy generation would be non existent but the effect on employment need only be limited by how many blowers we can fit in a field.

The upside of Clean Energy Economic Minnesota counting so many construction, maintenance, and repair jobs, especially those in energy efficiency, as “clean energy” jobs is that those jobs will quite likely persist beyond the phase-out of the tax credits. Next year’s report will be instructive.",https://files.americanexperiment.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/arno-senoner-6lOxktnqo04-unsplash-scaled.jpg?v=1733332540,N,,2025-10-16 18:08:47.482610

Everyone who’s not Duke Energy is still poring over this massive filing.","Duke Energy filed its 2025 resource plan earlier this month. The filing has drawn sharp criticism from environmental and clean energy advocates, and even has some business groups skeptical about future rate hikes.

WFAE’s climate reporter Zachary Turner sat down with host Nick de la Canal to break down what you need to know:

Nick de la Canal: To begin, what is this plan, and why should we care about it?

Zachary Turner: Duke files a resource plan every two years. It’s a roadmap that says what Duke’s going to build, like new power plants, when it’s going to build them, and about how much it’s going to cost ratepayers.

It also projects how much energy folks will need, and how the utility will supply it while lowering greenhouse gas emissions. Ideally.

De la Canal: Ideally?

Turner: Well, Duke’s resource plan also details how the utility will reach carbon neutrality by 2050. This means eliminating all greenhouse gas emissions that the utility doesn’t plan to offset with carbon credits.

Until earlier this year, the state mandated Duke to reduce emissions by 70% of 2005 levels by 2030 -- which is just five years away.

De la Canal: Right. That brings us to the differences between this plan and the 2023 plan. So, what’s changed?

Turner: The changes in this plan reflect the changes in the federal and state legislative landscape.

President Trump is ending clean energy tax credits, but preserving or creating incentives for battery storage and nuclear. He’s also putting his administration’s full weight behind fossil fuels.

Meanwhile, the state legislature rolled back that key 2030 climate target and made financing new nuclear reactors less risky for Duke Energy.

The result is a plan that pumps the brakes on solar energy, punts on wind energy and leans more heavily on natural gas and battery storage in the short term. Carbon pollution will go up during the next decade, with new gas plants coming online, and coal plants running up to an extra four years.

De la Canal: That makes sense. If the utility burns more fossil fuels, then its carbon emissions also go up.

Turner: Exactly. Burning fossil fuels is a primary driver of climate change. It’s also potentially driving up customers’ power bills, tying customer rates to fuels like natural gas that have volatile prices. Senior attorney David Neal with the Southern Environmental Law Center brought up that point at a recent conference in Raleigh:

David Neal: A big consequence of removing the interim target is unlocking Duke's plans to build more gas plants in the near term and to delay coal retirements, and that is going to put so much risk on customers

Turner: The plan also bets big on new nuclear reactors coming online in the late 2030s to curb those emissions and maybe even come close to meeting the 2050 carbon neutrality target.

De la Canal: What does that mean for the average person?

Turner: Right now, this is just a proposal. But if the commission approves this plan, it means bills will go up. Duke forecasts an unprecedented increase in energy demand over the next 10-15 years. That means building new infrastructure, increasing bills by an average 2.1% annually over the next 10 years.

There are also air quality concerns for power plant neighbors. For folks living near one of three coal plants, it means those facilities will continue running, with the Cliffside plant in Cleveland County running until 2040.

De la Canal: What are people saying about the plan?

Turner: Some business groups like Duke’s “all of the above” approach, because Duke markets this as the cheapest and most reliable pathway.

However, other groups, like the Carolina Utility Customers Association, worry more natural gas plants will strain North Carolina’s gas supply for industrial companies.

Other concerns about the plan fall into a few main camps:

There’s the climate problem. This plan goes against international climate goals to reduce near-term carbon emissions. We know Hurricane Helene and Tropical Storm Chantal were made worse by warmer ocean temperatures. Extreme heat and sea level rise continue to be a concern, and these problems don’t just go away if we reach carbon neutrality by 2050, and they certainly get worse the longer we burn fossil fuels.

Next, some groups worry that Duke plans to build too much new infrastructure. If Duke builds out a bunch of new gas-powered turbines for giant new electricity-guzzling customers like data centers who don’t ultimately come, ratepayers will get stuck with the bill.

De la Canal: What comes next?

Everyone who’s not Duke Energy is still poring over this massive filing. In the coming months, folks will comment on it and some groups might submit their own independent modeling of energy demand. The state’s new Energy Task Force, for example, will be trying to verify Duke’s findings.

Next year, the utilities commission will hold public hearings across the state before it takes a vote.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6ab7e45/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5568x2923+0+294/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe0%2F60%2F6413e56f4efeb467895c93bb33be%2F011423-duke-asheville-plant.JPG,N,,2025-10-16 18:10:09.380617

The grant will fund a planning work group to develop the program’s design, timeline, and evaluation strategy, aiming to create a clear pipeline into clean energy and energy efficiency careers. WCAC will leverage its 60 years of experience in the energy sector and its strong record in workforce development to help young people access training and employment opportunities in this growing field.

“MassCEC’s investment helps us design a program that not only prepares participants for clean energy jobs, but also supports their personal growth and financial stability,” said Patti Ovalles, JEC Director.

The planning process will focus on identifying employer partners, designing curriculum, and ensuring youth receive the wrap-around support needed to succeed, such as transportation assistance, food access, mental health referrals, and case management. Through collaboration with industry and workforce partners, WCAC aims to ensure participants are well-prepared for sustainable, high-demand careers in clean energy.

This grant builds on WCAC’s most recent green jobs training grant from the City of Worcester ARPA funds. As part of this effort, WCAC partnered with Green Jobs Academy to deliver a two-week Weatherization Training program. Four participants successfully completed the program, earning certifications in Lead Safety and OSHA 10, along with stipends and essential starter tools. A fifth participant is currently completing the training. WCAC is actively working with the City’s Energy Department to connect graduates with paid, two-week work experience, while continuing to support participants through regular communication and case management.

American Electric Power Transmission will upgrade power lines in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia, primarily to enhance enhance grid reliability and capacity, the Energy Department said. The project is meant to help meet surging electricity demand from data centers and artificial intelligence.

AEP said the upgrades would save customers an estimated $275 million in financing costs over the lifetime of the loan.

These projects will replace existing transmission lines with new lines that will be able to carry more energy, providing more reliability and further promoting economic growth, AEP said.

The work is expected to create 1,100 construction jobs.

“AEP is experiencing growth in energy demand that has not been seen in a generation. As the first company to close a new loan with the Trump Administration under this program, we are excited to get to work on these projects to improve the service we provide to our customers,” said Bill Fehrman, AEP chairman, president and chief executive officer. “This loan saves our customers money and improves reliability while supporting economic growth in our states. The funds we will save through this program enable us to make additional investments to enhance service for our customers.”

AEP stated energy demand has increased across its footprint, mainly due to business expansions that are expected to need an additional 24 gigawatts of electricity by 2030, AEP said. The updates are to help support data centers, artificial intelligence and manufacturing development without overloading the electric system.

The move comes as the Trump administration has moved to cancel $7.6 billion in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election. A total of 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable, the Energy Department said.

The cancellations include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub aimed at producing clean-burning hydrogen fuels to power ships and heavy-duty trucks. A hydrogen project costing up to $1 billion in the Pacific Northwest also was cancelled.

The loan guarantee finalized Thursday is the first offered by the Trump administration under the recently renamed Energy Dominance Financing program created by the massive tax-and-spending law approved this summer by congressional Republicans and signed by President Donald Trump. Electric utilities that receive loans through the program must provide assurances to the government that financial benefits from the financing will be passed on to customers, the Energy Department said.

The project and others being considered will help ensure that Americans ""will have access to affordable, reliable and secure energy for decades to come,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement.

“The president has been clear: America must reverse course from the energy subtraction agenda of past administrations and strengthen our electrical grid,'' Wright said, adding that modernizing the grid and expanding transmission capacity ""will help position the United States to win the AI race and grow our manufacturing base.”

In Ohio alone, there will be 76 projects to replace 2,122 lines, according to AEP. That's expected to serve approximately 1.5 million Ohio customers. Additionally, about 100 lines in Ohio and Oklahoma have been identified to be the first set of projects to be worked on for the loan guarantee.

More than 1,400 miles in Indiana and Michigan serving 600,000 customers, the company said. An additional 1,400 miles in Oklahoma, serving about 1.2 million people and 26 miles in West Virginia, serving 460,000 people, will be replaced.

AEP said it plans to work with local communities and landowners on critical transmission lines.

The loan guarantee will save customers money and improve reliability while supporting economic growth in the five states, said Bill Fehrman, AEP's chairman, president and chief executive officer.

“The funds we will save through this program enable us to make additional investments to enhance service for our customers,"" he added.

Wright, in a conference call with reporters, distinguished the AEP loan guarantee from a $4.9 billion federal loan guarantee the department cancelled in July. That money would have boosted the planned Grain Belt Express, a new high-voltage transmission line set to deliver solar and wind-generated electricity from the Midwest to eastern states.

The Energy Department said at the time it was “not critical for the federal government to have a role” in the first phase of the $11 billion project planned by Chicago-based Invenergy. The department also questioned whether the project could meet strict financial conditions required, a claim Wright repeated Thursday.

“Ultimately that is a commercial enterprise that needs private developers,” Wright said. The company has indicated the Grain Belt project will go forward.

Trump and Wright have repeatedly derided wind and solar energy as unreliable and opposed efforts to combat climate change by moving away from fossil fuels. Wright said the Grain Belt Express loan was among billions of dollars worth of commitments “rushed out the doors” by former President Joe Biden’s administration after the 2024 election.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/AP_texas_powergrid_41624,N,,2025-10-16 19:12:10.608900

Projects using Solar for All funds were planned to start in fall 2025, according to Jackson’s office.

Attorney General Jeff Jackson and representatives of 22 other states, as well as the District of Columbia, sued the EPA on Wednesday, saying the agency illegally canceled the Solar for All program.

Solar for All, a Biden-era initiative launched as part of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, allocated $7 billion in grants nationally to 60 recipients including states, tribes, and regions. The funds were earmarked for solar projects like rooftop solar and community solar gardens for more than 900,000 lower-income households.

The program’s discontinuation signified the Trump administration’s push away from cleaner energy, following additional cuts in the “One Big Beautiful Bill.”

Democrats in North Carolina’s congressional delegation sent a letter to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin in August, asking him to reconsider and ultimately reverse the program’s termination, NC Newsline previously reported.

Jackson said the funds would have helped low-income and rural North Carolinians save money on their energy bills.

“Thousands of families were going to have the option to install solar power, save money, and have another energy option after a major storm,” Jackson said in a statement. “Now EPA has illegally cancelled those funds — so I’m going to court to bring $150 million back to our state.”

North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality Secretary Reid Wilson said the program’s cancellation eliminates the installation of rooftop solar panels for more than 12,000 low- and medium-income families.

Projects using Solar for All funds were planned to start in fall 2025, according to Jackson’s office.

“Rooftop solar drives down utility bills, reduces air pollution and creates jobs. The program’s cancellation would hurt the electric grid’s ability to be resilient to future disasters, and would hamper North Carolina’s efforts to ensure reliable, clean and affordable energy supplies to meet the needs of a rapidly growing population and rising energy demand,” Wilson said in a statement.

Representatives for the EPA did not immediately respond to NC Newsline’s request for comment.

Plaintiffs described the EPA’s cancellation of the program and subsequent unilateral termination of all grant agreements as “a clear, unambiguous, and material breach of the agreements between the EPA and Plaintiffs,” the lawsuit read.

The plaintiffs’ grant agreements allowed for termination “only in the narrow circumstances of substantial noncompliance that materially impairs performance, adequate evidence of waste, fraud or abuse, or material representation of eligibility status,” the lawsuit read. Plaintiffs said these matters did not occur.

Canada has threatened legal action against carmaker Stellantis NV over what Ottawa says is the company’s unacceptable plan to shift production of one model to a United States plant.

Stellantis is a global automotive giant formed in 2021 from the merger of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and PSA Group. As the world’s fourth-largest automaker by volume, Stellantis owns well-known brands including Jeep, Ram, Dodge, Peugeot, and Citroën. The company operates across North America, Europe, and other key markets, offering a broad lineup from passenger cars to trucks and commercial vehicles.

On Wednesday, Minister of Industry Melanie Joly sent a letter to Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa noting that the company had agreed to maintain its Canadian presence in exchange for substantial financial support.

“Anything short of fulfilling that commitment will be considered a default under our agreement,” she said. If Stellantis did not live up to its commitment, Canada would “exercise all options, including legal,” she said.

In 2025, Stellantis is heavily focused on electrification and innovation, investing billions to develop electric vehicles and battery technologies. It aims to lead in sustainable mobility by launching new electric platforms and expanding hybrid and fully electric models. Stellantis is also adapting to global market challenges, including supply chain disruptions and changing consumer preferences.

Stellantis announced a $13 billion investment in the U.S. on Tuesday, a move that it said would bring five new models to the market, and as part of the plan, production of the Jeep Compass will move to the U.S. state of Illinois from a facility in Brampton in the Canadian province of Ontario.

For Canada, the controversy highlights the challenges of securing long-term commitments from global firms in a highly competitive and shifting auto landscape. As nations compete to attract EV investments, Canada is asserting its expectation that public funding must translate into stable, local jobs. The resolution of this issue could shape future investment policies and serve as a test case for how countries balance industrial support with accountability from private-sector partners.

“I have spoken with Stellantis to stress my disappointment with their decision,” Ontario Premier Doug Ford said in a social media post.

For Stellantis, this situation presents both opportunity and risk. On one hand, the company is strategically positioning itself to expand U.S. operations and meet growing demand for electric and hybrid vehicles. On the other hand, it risks damaging long-standing relationships with Canadian authorities and labor forces, which could complicate future investments and operations in the country.

Stellantis spokesperson LouAnn Gosselin said the company was investing in Canada and noted plans to add a third shift to a plant in Windsor, Ontario.

“Canada is very important to us. We have plans for Brampton and will share them upon further discussions with the Canadian government,” she said in an emailed statement.

This situation also reflects the increasing geopolitical and economic pressure on automakers to localize production amid rising protectionism and trade tensions. As countries like the U.S. and Canada compete for electric vehicle manufacturing and related supply chains, companies such as Stellantis must navigate not only market forces but also evolving government expectations tied to subsidies and job creation.

For Stellantis, balancing cost-efficiency with political goodwill will be critical in preserving access to incentives and avoiding reputational fallout. For Canada, the dispute reinforces the urgency of creating more binding industrial agreements that ensure long-term economic returns on public investment.",https://americanbazaaronline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/stellantis.png,N,,2025-10-16 19:12:18.600368

Andy Beshear has joined elected Democrats from other states in suing the Trump administration to stop what they call the “unlawful termination” of billions of dollars for residential solar projects.

A press release Wednesday from California Attorney General Rob Bonta stated the cancellation of the $7 billion “Solar for All” program denied states “critical funds they were depending on for solar energy in low-income and disadvantaged communities nationwide.”

Bonta is among more than a dozen Democratic attorneys general, along with Beshear and Democratic Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who are plaintiffs in the lawsuits alleging the program’s termination is illegal and unconstitutional.

When the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency terminated the program in August, Administrator Lee Zeldin in a statement on social media said the agency’s authority to administer the program was eliminated through the passage of a tax-and-spending law signed by Trump this summer. The Associated Press reported Zeldin characterized the program as a “boondoggle.”

An email received Thursday from the EPA’s press office stated the agency doesn’t comment on pending litigation.

Congress created the “Solar for All” program through the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, and the program aimed to expand residential solar energy projects to hundreds of thousands of low-income households across the country.

Kentucky officials planned to use a portion of $62 million from the program to install residential solar panels paired with battery storage systems on homes in “disaster-impacted communities.” A group of stakeholders had met several times this year in planning how the state would use the funding in communities affected by floods and tornadoes.

Robin Hartman, a spokesperson for the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet, in an early September email to the Lantern said the state couldn’t access its “Solar for All” funding because it was being “unlawfully withheld by the federal administration.”

A group of 21 Democratic members of the U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday urged the PJM Interconnection to make it easier to bring power supplies online, a move they said could help lower electricity costs.

In some parts of PJM, consumers face electric rate increases of more than 20% at a time when many people are struggling to keep up with the cost of living, according to the lawmakers.

“These rate increases are unaffordable and necessitate that PJM respond effectively to pursue reforms to the interconnection process that would address and prevent current and future rate hikes,” the lawmakers said in a letter, which was led by Rep. Don Beyer, D-Va.

The letter comes amid growing concerns about data center growth, which may contribute to rising electricity bills through transmission costs and their use of large amounts of electricity.

Also, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in July ruled that PJM failed to fully meet the agency’s new requirements for how grid operators interconnect power supplies. FERC told PJM to address a range of issues, including the agency’s requirements that interconnection studies reflect the planned charging behavior of battery storage projects and that they include an evaluation of grid-enhancing technologies.

“It’s concerning that when battery storage projects are a low-cost technology and quick way to add capacity to the existing grid, PJM insists on relying … on outdated and conservative charging assumptions to unfairly make battery projects uneconomic,” the lawmakers said.

Grid-enhancing technologies, also called alternative transmission technologies, can be installed more quickly and at lower costs compared to traditional network upgrades, according to the lawmakers.

“Failure to consider them leads to projects paying unnecessarily high grid upgrade costs, projects dropping out of the queue, and customers paying unjust and unreasonable rates,” they said. “This failure has contributed to the capacity auction shortfalls and higher prices we are seeing today.”

PJM is set to respond to FERC’s decision on Oct. 22.

The lawmakers also said PJM should consider additional interconnection reforms.

“Other grid operators have seen great results come from so-called connect and manage techniques, and PJM should work to make its energy-only interconnection pathway, the Energy Resource Interconnection Service, easier to use and faster than alternatives,” the lawmakers said.

The lawmakers also said they were concerned that PJM was favoring gas-fired power plants over other forms of generation and that it was considering expanding avenues for certain proposed generating resources to avoid the grid operator’s standard interconnection process.

As part of its fast-track stakeholder process considering rules for interconnection data centers and other large loads, PJM floated an “expedited interconnection track” for state-supported power projects larger than 500 MW. The fast-track review process would be open for 10 projects a year. The proposal is in addition to PJM’s one-time, fast-track Reliability Resource Initiative, which totals 9.4 GW of mainly gas and battery projects.

“We fear that a focus on new queue-jumping fast tracks for certain resource types or projects serving certain customers betrays a lack of seriousness in fixing the regular-order queue,” the lawmakers said.

Action in Pennsylvania

Meanwhile, Pennsylvania state legislators are also focused on PJM.

Democratic Sens. Nick Pisciottano and Nick Miller on Wednesday said they plan to introduce a resolution directing the Pennsylvania Joint State Government Commission to study their state’s participation in PJM.

The study would consider various issues, including alternative electricity delivery options and whether reforms such as state representation on PJM’s board or expanded state filing rights with federal regulators would benefit Pennsylvania.

Democratic House Rep. Robert Matzie plans to issue a similar resolution.

Despite the moves by lawmakers in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Illinois to study possible exits from PJM, it’s “extremely unlikely” that any state leaves the grid operator, analysts at Capstone, a research firm, said in a note Tuesday.

Separately, state Sen. Gene Yaw, chairman of the Pennsylvania Senate Environmental Resources and Energy Committee, along with Senate Majority leader Joe Pittman, and 15 other senators — all Republicans — urged PJM to be fuel agnostic in a letter sent to the grid operator on Tuesday.

“The funds we will save through this program enable us to make additional investments to enhance service for our customers,"" he added.

Wright, in a conference call with reporters, distinguished the AEP loan guarantee from a $4.9 billion federal loan guarantee the department cancelled in July. That money would have boosted the planned Grain Belt Express, a new high-voltage transmission line set to deliver solar and wind-generated electricity from the Midwest to eastern states.

The Energy Department said at the time it was “not critical for the federal government to have a role” in the first phase of the $11 billion project planned by Chicago-based Invenergy. The department also questioned whether the project could meet strict financial conditions required, a claim Wright repeated Thursday.

“Ultimately that is a commercial enterprise that needs private developers,” Wright said. The company has indicated the Grain Belt project will go forward.

Trump and Wright have repeatedly derided wind and solar energy as unreliable and opposed efforts to combat climate change by moving away from fossil fuels. Wright said the Grain Belt Express loan was among billions of dollars worth of commitments “rushed out the doors” by former President Joe Biden’s administration after the 2024 election.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/AP_texas_powergrid_41624,N,,2025-10-16 21:06:35.977687

“Advancing energy storage science and new technologies is a win-win.","The North Carolina Collaboratory and Innovate Carolina’s UNC Institute for Convergent Science published a report outlining the importance and feasibility of energy storage as existing energy needs and technologies shift.

The energy sector faces multiple challenges in the years ahead.

North Carolina is experiencing robust population growth — an average of 9.5% between 2010 and 2020. Meanwhile, the increased use of electric vehicles and artificial intelligence requires extra electricity per capita. In the midst of growing energy needs, Duke Energy, the state’s largest electricity provider, plans to achieve net-zero emissions by the year 2050.

In 2023, the North Carolina Collaboratory, housed at UNC-Chapel Hill, received $15 million from the North Carolina General Assembly to establish a research program focused on reliably and sustainably meeting the state’s future energy needs. The Next Generation Energy program supports academic research that can help inform and direct the state’s energy industry.

As part of this program, researchers from UNC-Chapel Hill’s economics and chemistry departments in the College of Arts and Sciences prepared “Supercharging Energy Storage Innovations in North Carolina,” a report detailing the benefits of investing in energy storage and the current research moving the field in that direction.

Energy storage entails capturing energy when it is produced faster than it is consumed and saving the excess for times when the reverse is true — like charging a smartphone battery at night to power the phone during the day. These large-scale batteries are important to stabilize the power grid regardless of the energy source, but they are especially crucial as we increase reliance on renewable sources such as wind and solar, which can fluctuate based on the weather and time of day.

The authors of the report explained that as the cost of wind and solar power has declined, their uptake has surged, making energy storage a more relevant issue than ever before. By modeling the ways various factors — like a new carbon tax or lower renewable energy costs — might affect the energy sector, the researchers concluded that capital costs currently remain too high to support widespread use of energy storage, but that research and investment into reducing those costs will yield substantial long-term benefits.

“We find that energy storage isn’t just a future technology. It’s an essential tool for today’s grid and tomorrow’s clean energy transition,” said Jeffrey Warren, executive director of the North Carolina Collaboratory and a professor of the practice of public policy and civic life and leadership. “This report is a call to action for policymakers, researchers and industry leaders to work together and build the infrastructure North Carolina will need.”

The report outlined five recommendations to boost industry investment in short-duration (using energy captured the same day) and long-duration (using energy captured on a previous day) storage solutions:

Make better energy data available for N.C. Detailed, day-to-day data on how North Carolina uses existing energy storage does not currently exist but would be instrumental in informing future decisions.

Enhance investments in long-duration storage. Most of North Carolina’s existing energy storage is short-duration storage.

Establish mechanisms for basic science researchers to communicate and collaborate with applied scientists. Collaboration between researchers making fundamental discoveries about the nature of energy and those working to invent new technologies can accelerate innovation.

Invest in shared user facilities for energy storage research. Core facilities and equipment that many scientists share can lower the barrier to entry for aspiring energy storage researchers.

Invest in metal-ion battery workforce development and innovations, including industry-academic partnerships. Like the lithium-ion batteries in small rechargeable devices, metal-ion battery technology could support large-scale energy storage efforts.

“Energy storage is the bridge between our current grid and the energy future we envision for North Carolina,” said Greg Copenhaver, director of the Institute for Convergent Science, the Chancellor’s Eminent Professor of Convergent Science and chair of the math department at Carolina. “Advancing energy storage science and new technologies is a win-win. It’s about building a system that works smarter, cleaner, and more reliably for everyone.”",https://college.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/1280/2025/10/nc-energy-report-sep26_Final-e1760645937381.jpeg,N,,2025-10-16 17:09:59.255451

The EPA program, later named SFA, selected 60 grant recipients, including states, tribal governments, local governments, and nonprofit groups, to receive this funding.
In the District Court, Attorney General James and the coalition argue that EPA’s termination of the SFA program is illegal and unconstitutional.
Attorney General James and the coalition also argue in the Court of Federal Claims that revoking the already obligated SFA grants is an illegal breach of contract and taking of property.
Attorney General James and the coalition are seeking a court order from the District Court ruling EPA’s elimination of SFA unlawful and ordering the resumption of the program.","NEW YORK – New York Attorney General Letitia James joined a coalition of plaintiffs in filing two lawsuits to protect billions of dollars in grant funding that would connect nearly one million households nationwide in low-income and vulnerable communities with affordable solar power. In August, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) illegally ended the Solar for All (SFA) program and rescinded billions of dollars already issued to states to fund programs that would bring low-cost home solar power to communities nationwide. Attorney General James and the coalition have filed lawsuits in the Court of Federal Claims and the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington seeking court orders ruling the administration’s termination of SFA unlawful and damages for the termination of individual grants worth billions of dollars.

“Providing more communities with affordable clean energy will help lower energy bills and tackle the climate crisis,” said Attorney General James. “The Solar for All program delivers critical resources to help install solar power on homes across the country. The EPA’s cancellation of Solar for All is illegal and unconstitutional, and I will keep fighting to ensure our communities have access to these funds.”

“The Trump administration's continued assault on clean energy programs, including the attempt to cancel the Solar for All Program, is in direct contrast to the President's claims of wanting U.S. energy independence,” said Governor Kathy Hochul. “The Statewide Solar for All program is part of a true all-of-the-above energy strategy in New York that is designed to generate significant benefits for our health, environment, economy, and for the thousands of New Yorkers who would benefit from lower electric bills.”

“At a time when affordability is top of mind for every New Yorker, especially for those with low to moderate incomes, the federal government should be partnering with states to advance an abundance of locally produced, clean energy that can help provide cost savings on monthly electric bills,” said Doreen M. Harris, President and CEO, New York State Energy Research and Development Authority. “The Environmental Protection Agency’s unlawful termination of the federal Solar for All program is creating a crippling ripple effect on the clean energy industry while forcing hard-working Americans to choose between household essentials as they try to budget for the increasing costs of electricity, heat and groceries.”

As part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, Congress created and funded an EPA program that would provide states with funding to help low-income and vulnerable communities access clean energy technologies, including rooftop solar power. The EPA program, later named SFA, selected 60 grant recipients, including states, tribal governments, local governments, and nonprofit groups, to receive this funding. In August 2024, EPA announced that it had obligated $7 billion through SFA to deliver residential solar power to more than 900,000 low-income households nationwide. In New York, the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) was awarded $249,800,000 in SFA funding. Leaders in states across the country began developing SFA programs, meeting with community members and utility companies, and negotiating agreements with contractors to help install new solar infrastructure.

In July 2025, the administration enacted legislation that rescinded any remaining funds that had not been obligated as part of SFA. However, in August 2025, EPA began illegally targeting SFA and its funding that had already been obligated to states – funding that should not have been impacted by the new legislation. On August 7, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced, “the Trump EPA is…ending Solar for All for good.” Shortly after, EPA shut down the SFA program and removed up to 90 percent of states’ SFA funds with no explanation.

In the District Court, Attorney General James and the coalition argue that EPA’s termination of the SFA program is illegal and unconstitutional. Stripping this program away entirely from states violates the Administrative Procedure Act and overrides Congress’s constitutional power of the purse. Attorney General James and the coalition also argue in the Court of Federal Claims that revoking the already obligated SFA grants is an illegal breach of contract and taking of property.

Attorney General James and the coalition are seeking a court order from the District Court ruling EPA’s elimination of SFA unlawful and ordering the resumption of the program. In addition, they are seeking damages from the Court of Federal Claims for the unlawful termination of individual grants, including the nearly $250 million grant to NYSERDA.

Joining Attorney General James in filing the lawsuit in the District Court are the attorneys general of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and the District of Columbia.

The report, released Thursday by the Commonwealth Fund, comes on the 16th day of the ongoing federal government shutdown as congressional Democrats and Republicans have so far failed to agree on a deal to extend the enhanced tax credits from the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, which were bolstered by later legislation such as the American Rescue Plan Act and the Inflation Reduction Act during the Biden administration. The Trump administration's recent One Big Beautiful Bill Act does not extend those enhanced tax credits and also imposes cuts to Medicaid through work requirements. Democrats see the shutdown as a way to gain some leverage with Republicans in reversing some of these moves.

The analysis finds that if the enhanced tax credits are not renewed, state economies would shrink by $40.7 billion in 2026, roughly 339,000 jobs would be lost, and state and local tax revenues would be reduced by $2.5 billion.

The report cites an earlier analysis by the Urban Institute estimating that nearly 5 million people would become uninsured beginning in January 2026, and millions more would see their premiums rise.

Extending the tax credits would help keep health insurance costs affordable, but the push to extend the premium tax credits has become a point of contention on Capitol Hill.

The analysis, led by Leighton Ku and colleagues at GW, used new data to update earlier research that explored the economic impacts of letting the ACA marketplace tax credits expire.

The analysis finds that federal funding for marketplace tax credits will decline by $31 billion unless the enhanced tax credits are renewed. The reductions in funding for health care along with the related downstream impact, will cause state economies to shrink by nearly $41 billion.

Due to these economic losses, nearly 340,000 jobs will be lost in 2026, with slightly less than half in the health care sector. State and local revenues would decline by $2.5 billion.

The states hit hardest by the job losses are mainly in the South, with some of the deepest impacts in red states. Texas would be the state most affected, followed by Florida, Georgia, California, South Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama, Louisiana, North Carolina and Mississippi.

""There is an urgent need to decide whether to extend the ACA tax credits soon; insurance enrollment begins on November 1,"" said Leighton Ku, professor of health policy and lead author of the report, in a statement Thursday. Not only will health insurance costs soar for millions if the tax credits are not sustained, there will be severe economic consequences and more than 300,000 Americans could lose their jobs.""",https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e8a7e5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/500x263+0+24/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsource-media-brightspot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2F8d%2F30%2Fa7e7c9ca41d48599e380d71b560e%2Fp19ipf54g4pfc1mh83t81phkr8kb.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 17:09:30.249510

“The loss of jobs will strain the solar industry in our state, which is the twelfth-fastest growing clean energy jobs market in the country.
Weiser and other attorneys general previously won the court battle over federal grants for EV chargers, including $5 billion for a series of fast chargers at strategically space locations.
Colorado said its version of the Solar for All program “will accelerate the adoption of three different solar installation types: single-family rooftop, multifamily rooftop solar and community solar (for residential subscribers),” according to the Colorado Energy Office.","Colorado joined 22 other states Wednesday in suing the Trump administration in federal claims court over cancellation of $7 billion in nationwide grants meant to give lower-income families access to “Solar for All,” including nearly $150 million for the state.

The grants were made under funding provided by the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, and their cancellation in April was part of a rapid string of Trump administration moves to gut renewable energy subsidies and promote traditional fossil fuels with more coal mining and oil drilling on federal land. The lawsuit, joined by Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, says the Congressional funding and EPA awards could only be legally rescinded for fraud or waste, not over changes in political policy.

Colorado had been awarded $156 million for its Solar for All programs, and the April moves by EPA wiped out all but $11 million of that, Weiser’s office said in announcing the lawsuit. The Colorado grants would have funded programs creating “1,000 jobs and delivering clean solar energy to more than 20,000 low-income households,” the attorney general said.

If the program stays canceled, Coloradans “will not get the benefits of affordable, clean solar energy, including no-cost installations and lower electricity bills,” Weiser said, in a release. “The loss of jobs will strain the solar industry in our state, which is the twelfth-fastest growing clean energy jobs market in the country. … We are bringing these lawsuits to recover the funds and resume this important program.”

The latest suit is part of a fierce ongoing legal battle between Democratic state governments and the GOP Trump administration. Local Democrats and Congressional leaders who passed the 2022 bills say the Trump executive branch does not have the constitutional power to rescind money for programs already approved by Congress.

The Trump administration in turn has called Biden-era renewable energy support a “Green New Scam,” and has tried to pull back money and permitting for everything from fast EV charging networks to major offshore wind electricity farms.

Weiser and other attorneys general previously won the court battle over federal grants for EV chargers, including $5 billion for a series of fast chargers at strategically space locations. A federal judge in June said the administration had overstepped its powers in freezing the EV charger budget, and Colorado was set to resume its grants for the program.

Colorado said its version of the Solar for All program “will accelerate the adoption of three different solar installation types: single-family rooftop, multifamily rooftop solar and community solar (for residential subscribers),” according to the Colorado Energy Office. State officials said the grants would bring lower-priced energy to struggling households while also pushing Colorado faster toward its goals of using 100% clean energy by 2040.",https://newspack-coloradosun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/BasaltVista_HC_08.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 17:08:43.748503

Virtual power plants (VPPs) are emerging as a popular method to aggregate DERs to efficiently respond to fluctuations in energy supply and demand.
VPPs use data analytics to forecast energy needs and dispatch energy from DERs to the grid accordingly.","DER Opportunities

Electricity Costs

DERS are gaining attention among policymakers for several reasons. First, they can offer financial benefits to customers. DERs, like rooftop solar panels, can supply energy directly to the building they are located on. As a result, the customer can lower their electricity bills as they produce more of their own electricity. Additionally, if the DER generates more electricity than the customer needs, they can sell excess electricity back to the grid, depending on market design and technological capability.

Some consumers are also turning to DERs due to the direct control they have over their energy. For example, consumers in areas that experience many outages or extreme weather events may want DERs that allow them to be self-reliant for power. Household battery systems, for example, may be beneficial for users who want to passively store power for emergencies. In areas where rates have increased, some users may also want to generate their own electricity using DERs to have direct control over the cost of their energy consumption.

Accelerated Interconnection

DERs also allow new clean sources of energy to be integrated onto the grid more efficiently. While DERs operate on the distribution grid, traditional large scale energy resources require high-voltage transmission lines to deliver electricity to their site of use. These transmission lines generally cover long distances and require a lengthy siting and development process, resulting in a growing backlog of proposed energy projects waiting in interconnection queues. However, DERs are often located near their site of use, so new transmission infrastructure is not necessary, allowing new energy resources to be deployed more quickly. Though DERs are not immediately “plug and play,” they offer quicker solutions to meet energy needs compared to traditional infrastructure.

Reliability and Resilience

DERs can also improve energy reliability and resilience by decentralizing the grid. Threats to the grid, such as extreme weather events, can damage generating plants for transmission lines and disrupt the supply of power. When the transmission system is interrupted, DERs can still operate and provide power. For example, microgrids are one DER that provides resilience during outages. A microgrid is a group of interconnected loads and DERs within a defined boundary that acts as a single controllable entity, separate from the grid. Therefore, while microgrids operate harmoniously with the larger grid during normal operations, they can also disconnect from the grid to operate autonomously in “island mode” while the rest of the grid is down.

As previously described, DERs are not only resources that generate electricity. Programs and innovations that manage how energy is used can also be considered a DER. Virtual power plants (VPPs) are emerging as a popular method to aggregate DERs to efficiently respond to fluctuations in energy supply and demand. VPPs use data analytics to forecast energy needs and dispatch energy from DERs to the grid accordingly. The optimized use of DERs can improve grid reliability through a cost-effective manner.",,N,,2025-10-16 19:10:16.879118

Additionally, about 100 lines in Ohio and Oklahoma have been identified to be the first set of projects to be worked on for the loan guarantee.
AEP said it plans to work with local communities and landowners on critical transmission lines.
Wright, in a conference call with reporters, distinguished the AEP loan guarantee from a $4.9 billion federal loan guarantee the department cancelled in July.","OHIO — The Department of Energy said Thursday it has finalized a $1.6 billion loan guarantee to a subsidiary of one of the nation's largest power companies to upgrade nearly 5,000 miles of transmission lines across five states, mostly in the Midwest, for largely fossil fuel-run energy.

American Electric Power Transmission will upgrade power lines in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia, primarily to enhance enhance grid reliability and capacity, the Energy Department said. The project is meant to help meet surging electricity demand from data centers and artificial intelligence.

AEP said the upgrades would save customers an estimated $275 million in financing costs over the lifetime of the loan.

These projects will replace existing transmission lines with new lines that will be able to carry more energy, providing more reliability and further promoting economic growth, AEP said.

The work is expected to create 1,100 construction jobs.

“AEP is experiencing growth in energy demand that has not been seen in a generation. As the first company to close a new loan with the Trump Administration under this program, we are excited to get to work on these projects to improve the service we provide to our customers,” said Bill Fehrman, AEP chairman, president and chief executive officer. “This loan saves our customers money and improves reliability while supporting economic growth in our states. The funds we will save through this program enable us to make additional investments to enhance service for our customers.”

AEP stated energy demand has increased across its footprint, mainly due to business expansions that are expected to need an additional 24 gigawatts of electricity by 2030, AEP said. The updates are to help support data centers, artificial intelligence and manufacturing development without overloading the electric system.

The move comes as the Trump administration has moved to cancel $7.6 billion in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election. A total of 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable, the Energy Department said.

The cancellations include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub aimed at producing clean-burning hydrogen fuels to power ships and heavy-duty trucks. A hydrogen project costing up to $1 billion in the Pacific Northwest also was cancelled.

The loan guarantee finalized Thursday is the first offered by the Trump administration under the recently renamed Energy Dominance Financing program created by the massive tax-and-spending law approved this summer by congressional Republicans and signed by President Donald Trump. Electric utilities that receive loans through the program must provide assurances to the government that financial benefits from the financing will be passed on to customers, the Energy Department said.

The project and others being considered will help ensure that Americans ""will have access to affordable, reliable and secure energy for decades to come,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement.

“The president has been clear: America must reverse course from the energy subtraction agenda of past administrations and strengthen our electrical grid,'' Wright said, adding that modernizing the grid and expanding transmission capacity ""will help position the United States to win the AI race and grow our manufacturing base.”

In Ohio alone, there will be 76 projects to replace 2,122 lines, according to AEP. That's expected to serve approximately 1.5 million Ohio customers. Additionally, about 100 lines in Ohio and Oklahoma have been identified to be the first set of projects to be worked on for the loan guarantee.

More than 1,400 miles in Indiana and Michigan serving 600,000 customers, the company said. An additional 1,400 miles in Oklahoma, serving about 1.2 million people and 26 miles in West Virginia, serving 460,000 people, will be replaced.

AEP said it plans to work with local communities and landowners on critical transmission lines.

The loan guarantee will save customers money and improve reliability while supporting economic growth in the five states, said Bill Fehrman, AEP's chairman, president and chief executive officer.

“The funds we will save through this program enable us to make additional investments to enhance service for our customers,"" he added.

Wright, in a conference call with reporters, distinguished the AEP loan guarantee from a $4.9 billion federal loan guarantee the department cancelled in July. That money would have boosted the planned Grain Belt Express, a new high-voltage transmission line set to deliver solar and wind-generated electricity from the Midwest to eastern states.

The Energy Department said at the time it was “not critical for the federal government to have a role” in the first phase of the $11 billion project planned by Chicago-based Invenergy. The department also questioned whether the project could meet strict financial conditions required, a claim Wright repeated Thursday.

“Ultimately that is a commercial enterprise that needs private developers,” Wright said. The company has indicated the Grain Belt project will go forward.

Trump and Wright have repeatedly derided wind and solar energy as unreliable and opposed efforts to combat climate change by moving away from fossil fuels. Wright said the Grain Belt Express loan was among billions of dollars worth of commitments “rushed out the doors” by former President Joe Biden’s administration after the 2024 election.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/AP_texas_powergrid_41624,N,,2025-10-16 19:11:14.150111

The loan guarantee to AEP was among those conditionally approved under Biden, a fact Wright acknowledged to reporters.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Department of Energy said Thursday it has finalized a $1.6 billion loan guarantee to a subsidiary of one of the nation's largest power companies to upgrade nearly 5,000 miles of transmission lines across five states, mostly in the Midwest, for largely fossil fuel-run energy.

AEP Transmission will upgrade power lines in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia to enhance enhance grid reliability and capacity, the Energy Department said. The project, first offered under the Biden administration, is meant to help meet surging electricity demand from data centers and artificial intelligence.

Ohio-based American Electric Power, which owns AEP Transmission, is one of the nation's largest utilities, serving 5.6 million customers in 11 states. It primarily produces electricity from coal, natural gas and nuclear power, along with renewable resources such as wind and hydroelectric power.

Thursday's announcement deepens the Trump administration’s commitment to traditional, polluting energy sources even as it works to discourage the U.S. from clean energy use.

Earlier this month, the administration cancelled $7.6 billion in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election. A total of 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable, the Energy Department said.

The cancellations include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub aimed at developing clean-burning hydrogen fuels to power ships and heavy-duty trucks. A hydrogen project costing up to $1 billion in the Pacific Northwest also was cancelled.

The loan guarantee finalized Thursday is the first offered by the Trump administration under the recently renamed Energy Dominance Financing program created by the massive tax-and-spending law approved this summer by congressional Republicans and signed by President Donald Trump. Electric utilities that receive loans through the program must provide assurances to the government that financial benefits from the financing will be passed on to customers, the Energy Department said.

The project and others being considered will help ensure that Americans ""will have access to affordable, reliable and secure energy for decades to come,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement.

“The president has been clear: America must reverse course from the energy subtraction agenda of past administrations and strengthen our electrical grid,'' Wright said, adding that modernizing the grid and expanding transmission capacity ""will help position the United States to win the AI race and grow our manufacturing base.”

The upgrades supported by the federal financing will replace existing transmission lines in existing rights-of-way with new lines capable of carrying more energy, the power company said.

More than 2,000 miles of transmission lines in Ohio serving 1.5 million people will be replaced, along with more than 1,400 miles in Indiana and Michigan serving 600,000 customers, the company said. An additional 1,400 miles in Oklahoma, serving about 1.2 million people and 26 miles in West Virginia, serving 460,000 people, will be replaced.

The projects will create about 1,100 construction jobs, the company said.

The loan guarantee will save customers money and improve reliability while supporting economic growth in the five states, said Bill Fehrman, AEP's chairman, president and chief executive officer. “The funds we will save through this program enable us to make additional investments to enhance service for our customers,"" he added.

Wright, in a conference call with reporters, distinguished the AEP loan guarantee from a $4.9 billion federal loan guarantee the department cancelled in July. That money would have boosted the planned Grain Belt Express, a new high-voltage transmission line set to deliver solar and wind-generated electricity from the Midwest to eastern states.

The Energy Department said at the time it was “not critical for the federal government to have a role” in the first phase of the $11 billion project planned by Chicago-based Invenergy. The department also questioned whether the project could meet strict financial conditions required, a claim Wright repeated Thursday.

“Ultimately that is a commercial enterprise that needs private developers,” Wright said. The company has indicated the Grain Belt project will go forward.

Trump and Wright have repeatedly derided wind and solar energy as unreliable and opposed efforts to combat climate change by moving away from fossil fuels. Wright said the Grain Belt Express loan was among billions of dollars worth of commitments “rushed out the door” in the waning days of former President Joe Biden’s administration.

The loan guarantee to AEP was among those conditionally approved under Biden, a fact Wright acknowledged to reporters.

“Not all of the (Biden-era) projects were nonsense,"" he said, adding that he was “happy to move forward” with the transmission upgrade.

FAQ: Arizona Copper Mine Reopening Which Companies Are Leading Arizona Copper Mine Reopening Efforts?","The convergence of federal policy changes, surging copper prices, and supply chain vulnerabilities has created an unprecedented opportunity for reopening copper mines in Arizona. Mining executives are increasingly viewing dormant Arizona operations as strategic assets rather than stranded investments, particularly as domestic mineral security becomes a national priority. Furthermore, copper price insights indicate sustained bullish sentiment supporting these reopening initiatives.

Arizona's established mining infrastructure provides a compelling advantage over greenfield developments. The state's 150-year mining heritage has created a foundation of processing facilities, transportation networks, and skilled workforce populations that can be reactivated rather than built from scratch. This infrastructure advantage becomes particularly valuable when considering the 7-12 year development timelines typical for new mining projects.

The Perfect Storm Driving Mine Reopening Decisions

Federal policy realignment under the Trump administration represents what industry leaders characterize as a fundamental critical minerals policy shift for the mining sector, prioritising domestic production capabilities and supply chain security. The designation of copper as a critical mineral under federal guidelines has streamlined permitting processes and introduced tax incentives specifically targeting domestic production capabilities.

Copper price trajectories have reached multi-year highs, with the London Metal Exchange reflecting sustained demand growth driven by global electrification initiatives. The International Energy Agency projects a 24% increase in copper demand by 2035, creating supply-demand imbalances that favour reopening copper mines in Arizona over waiting for new discoveries.

Supply chain disruptions exposed during recent global events have highlighted the risks of import dependency. Currently, the United States relies on imports for approximately 40% of its copper needs, with Chile, Canada, and Mexico serving as primary suppliers. This dependency creates strategic vulnerabilities that domestic production can help mitigate.

Arizona's Dominant Position in U.S. Copper Production

Metric Arizona National Context Share of U.S. Production 70% Leading state Active Major Operations 6+ mines Morenci, Sierrita, Miami Historical Significance 150+ years Continuous mining heritage Infrastructure Status Established Processing facilities, transport corridors

Arizona's dominance in American copper production stems from geological advantages and decades of infrastructure development. The state's major operations including Freeport-McMoRan's Morenci mine, South32's Sierrita operation, and KGHM International's Miami facility provide a foundation for supporting additional production capacity through reopened facilities. In addition, modern mining technology enables these facilities to achieve higher efficiency standards than historical operations.

Which Shuttered Arizona Copper Mines Are Being Considered for Reopening?

BHP is actively evaluating four shuttered copper mines in Arizona's Globe-Miami region, including the historic Magma mine acquired in 1996. This strategic review encompasses not only the mines themselves but also the potential for reprocessing tailings from historical operations to extract additional copper using modern technologies.

The Globe-Miami mining district offers unique advantages for reopening projects, including existing processing infrastructure, established transportation corridors via State Route 60, and proximity to skilled mining professionals. These factors significantly reduce the capital requirements and timeline compared to developing entirely new operations.

Globe-Miami Region: The Historic Mining Corridor Revival

The Magma mine operated continuously from 1910 to 1996, producing over 12 billion pounds of copper during its operational lifetime. The facility's 29-year idle status presents both challenges and opportunities, as modern extraction technologies can potentially recover copper from previously uneconomical ore grades and historical tailings.

Legacy operations in the Globe-Miami region benefit from proven ore reserves and geological data spanning decades of production. This historical knowledge base reduces exploration risk and provides detailed understanding of ore body characteristics, mineralisation patterns, and optimal extraction methods.

Transportation infrastructure remains intact throughout the mining corridor, with established rail access and highway connections facilitating movement of concentrate to processing facilities. The region's proximity to major population centres also ensures availability of skilled workforce and support services.

Resolution Copper: The Game-Changing Development Project

Resolution Copper represents one of the largest undeveloped copper deposits in North America, containing approximately 1.8 billion metric tons of ore with an average grade of 1.5% copper, potentially supplying 25% of total U.S. copper demand once operational.

The Resolution Copper project operates as a joint venture between Rio Tinto (55%) and BHP (45%), formed in 2004 to develop deposits located near Superior, Arizona. This partnership combines international mining expertise with domestic market knowledge to advance one of North America's most significant undeveloped copper resources.

The project entered a new development phase in 2023, with environmental impact assessment processes ongoing. However, the timeline faces regulatory complexities related to federal land exchanges and environmental compliance requirements that could extend development schedules.

Economic impact projections suggest Resolution Copper could generate substantial revenue for Arizona communities and state coffers once operational. The scale of the deposit positions it as a cornerstone project for American copper self-sufficiency initiatives.

What Economic Factors Make Arizona Mine Reopening Financially Viable?

Mine reopening projects offer compelling economic advantages over greenfield development, requiring 40-60% less capital investment due to existing infrastructure and proven reserves. This cost differential becomes particularly significant in current capital markets where mining project financing faces increased scrutiny and higher interest rates.

Timeline advantages provide additional economic benefits, as reopening projects can achieve production within 2-4 years compared to 7-12 years for new developments. This compressed timeline reduces financing costs and allows producers to capitalise on current favourable commodity price environments.

Copper Market Fundamentals Supporting Investment Decisions

Global electrification initiatives are driving unprecedented copper demand growth, with renewable energy infrastructure requiring significantly more copper per unit of electricity generation compared to traditional fossil fuel systems. Consequently, surging copper demand creates favourable conditions for reopening dormant facilities.

Supply-demand imbalances have created sustained price support for copper, with global mine supply facing deficits beginning in 2025-2026 as new project development lags behind demand growth. These market fundamentals provide revenue stability for reopening investments.

Treatment and refining charge markets reflect tight concentrate supply conditions. Japan, Spain, and South Korea issued joint warnings about plunging treatment charges, with some Chinese smelters processing copper at zero or negative rates, indicating severe supply constraints that benefit concentrate producers.

Premium pricing for domestically sourced critical minerals adds additional revenue potential for Arizona operations. National security considerations and supply chain resilience initiatives create market premiums for domestic copper supplies.

Cost-Benefit Analysis of Reopening vs. New Development

Factor Mine Reopening Greenfield Development Initial Capital 40-60% lower Full development costs Timeline to Production 2-4 years 7-12 years Infrastructure Costs Existing/Upgradeable Complete new build Permitting Complexity Streamlined process Full environmental review Resource Risk Proven reserves Exploration dependent Workforce Availability Established communities New recruitment required

Infrastructure rehabilitation costs represent the primary capital requirement for reopening projects, involving structural assessments of shafts, hoists, and underground workings. However, these costs remain substantially lower than complete facility construction required for greenfield developments.

Equipment procurement represents a significant consideration, with major mining equipment currently facing 18-24 month delivery timelines due to global supply chain constraints. However, some reopening projects may utilise refurbished equipment or benefit from existing machinery stored at facility sites.

How Are Policy Changes Accelerating Arizona Copper Mine Development?

The Trump administration's approach to critical minerals represents what industry executives describe as a breathtaking shift for the mining sector, prioritising domestic production capabilities and supply chain security. This policy realignment has created regulatory frameworks specifically designed to support domestic copper production initiatives.

Federal critical minerals strategy implementation includes expedited permitting processes for domestic copper projects, reducing typical NEPA review timelines that historically required 7-10 years for major mining operations. These streamlined processes specifically target projects that enhance domestic supply capabilities.

Federal Critical Minerals Strategy Impact

Copper's designation on the U.S. Geological Survey's list of 50 critical minerals deemed essential to economic and national security has established regulatory frameworks prioritising domestic production. This designation provides access to expedited review processes and federal support programmes.

Tax incentives through the Inflation Reduction Act include Advanced Manufacturing Production Credits specifically applicable to domestic critical mineral production. These incentives improve project economics by reducing effective tax rates for qualifying operations.

National security considerations have elevated copper to strategic mineral status, creating policy frameworks that view domestic production as essential infrastructure rather than purely commercial activity. This shift influences regulatory decision-making and resource allocation priorities.

State-Level Support Mechanisms

Arizona's mining-friendly regulatory environment provides additional advantages for reopening projects, with established frameworks for permitting and environmental compliance that complement federal initiatives. The state's experience with mining regulation reduces bureaucratic uncertainties common in other jurisdictions.

Workforce development programmes specifically target skilled mining positions, addressing labour shortages that could constrain production expansion. These programmes coordinate with educational institutions and industry partners to ensure adequate skilled workforce availability.

Infrastructure investment commitments at state and local levels support mining operations through improved transportation networks, utility capacity, and communication systems. These investments reduce operational costs and improve project viability.

What Modern Technologies Are Enabling Sustainable Mine Reopening?

Advanced extraction and processing technologies have fundamentally transformed the economics of mine reopening by enabling recovery of copper from previously uneconomical ore grades and historical waste materials. These technological improvements make idle facilities viable under current market conditions.

Automated mining systems reduce operational costs by 15-20% while improving worker safety by removing personnel from hazardous underground environments. These systems also provide more precise extraction capabilities, maximising ore recovery rates and reducing waste generation.

Advanced Extraction and Processing Methods

Modern flotation and leaching technologies can economically extract copper from historical tailings with grades as low as 0.15-0.20%, compared to 0.40%+ required by older technologies. This capability transforms historical waste into valuable resources, extending mine life and improving project economics.

Tailings reprocessing capabilities offer additional revenue streams for reopened operations, utilising existing waste materials that previous mining activities left behind. Advanced processing methods can extract not only copper but also precious metals and other valuable minerals from these materials.

Improved ore processing technologies maximise recovery rates from primary mining activities, ensuring more complete extraction of valuable minerals from processed ore. These improvements reduce waste generation and increase revenue per ton of ore processed.

Environmental Management and Water Conservation

Modern copper mining operations in Arizona utilise advanced water recycling systems that can reduce freshwater consumption by up to 85% compared to traditional methods, addressing critical environmental concerns in arid regions.

Closed-loop water systems minimise environmental impact by recycling process water through multiple treatment stages, reducing freshwater requirements and eliminating liquid waste discharge. Furthermore, South32's Sierrita operation near Tucson demonstrates this technology's effectiveness, recovering over 80% of process water.

Renewable energy integration provides operational cost reduction and environmental benefits, with several Arizona copper mines deploying solar power installations. Freeport-McMoRan's Bagdad mine implemented a 65-megawatt solar facility in 2024, demonstrating renewable energy viability for large-scale mining operations.

Land reclamation technologies enable restoration of post-mining landscapes to productive uses, addressing environmental concerns whilst creating long-term community benefits. These technologies transform former mining areas into recreational facilities, wildlife habitat, or agricultural land.

What Timeline Should Investors Expect for Arizona Copper Mine Reopening?

Mine reopening projects typically require comprehensive evaluation phases before production decisions, with feasibility studies and resource confirmation drilling representing initial milestones. These studies assess infrastructure condition, ore reserve viability, and regulatory requirements.

BHP's evaluation of four Globe-Miami region mines represents early-stage analysis that could extend 12-18 months before final reopening decisions. These assessments must address 29 years of facility idleness and evaluate infrastructure modernisation requirements.

Current import levels of approximately 40% represent significant exposure to international supply disruptions and geopolitical tensions.

The combined market value of the world's 50 most valuable mining companies reached nearly $2 trillion in Q3 2025, reflecting strong investor interest in copper and critical mineral producers. This valuation growth demonstrates market confidence in long-term demand fundamentals supporting reopening investments.

Reducing Import Dependency and Geopolitical Risk

Arizona mine reopening creates strategic buffer capacity against international supply disruptions, reducing reliance on imports from politically unstable regions. Recent geopolitical tensions have highlighted risks associated with concentrated supply chains and foreign dependency for critical materials.

Strengthening North American copper supply security supports regional economic integration and reduces transportation costs associated with intercontinental shipping. Domestic production also eliminates currency exchange risks and trade policy uncertainties affecting international purchases.

Chinese copper export activity reflects tight global supply conditions, with smelters shipping up to 50,000 tons to international warehouses as record London prices create arbitrage opportunities. This activity demonstrates global supply chain stress that domestic production can help alleviate.

Supporting Domestic Manufacturing and Clean Energy Transition

Local copper availability supports domestic renewable energy infrastructure development by reducing material costs and ensuring supply reliability for solar installations, wind turbines, and electric vehicle charging networks. These applications require substantially more copper than traditional energy systems.

Reduced transportation costs benefit domestic manufacturers by eliminating international shipping expenses and delivery uncertainties. However, US copper project insights suggest that local copper supplies also provide more responsive delivery schedules and flexible ordering arrangements compared to international suppliers.

Job creation across the mining and processing value chain extends beyond direct mining employment to include transportation, equipment supply, professional services, and community support activities. These economic multiplier effects provide regional development benefits.

What Challenges Could Delay Arizona Copper Mine Reopening Projects?

Regulatory complexity remains a significant challenge for mine reopening projects, despite policy changes intended to streamline processes. Federal land use approvals and environmental compliance requirements must address current standards that may differ significantly from historical operational permits.

Water rights allocation represents a critical constraint in Arizona's arid environment, where historic mining operations may hold existing rights but reactivation requires state regulatory approval under prior appropriation water law. Competition for limited water resources creates potential delays and cost increases.

Regulatory and Environmental Hurdles

Environmental compliance requirements for reopened mines must address current Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, and NEPA standards that often require significant upgrades from historical operational practices. These upgrades can substantially increase reopening costs and timeline requirements.

Community relations and stakeholder engagement processes have become more complex since many Arizona mines originally operated, requiring extensive consultation and benefit-sharing arrangements. Resolution Copper's extended permitting process demonstrates these challenges' potential impact on project timelines.

Federal land use approvals involve multiple agencies and complex procedures, particularly for projects requiring land exchanges or modifications to existing federal land designations. These processes can extend regulatory timelines beyond initial projections.

Technical and Financial Risk Factors

Mine reopening projects face unique challenges including ageing infrastructure assessment, updated safety compliance, and workforce recruitment in competitive labour markets where experienced mining professionals command premium compensation.

Infrastructure modernisation costs can escalate significantly when detailed engineering assessments reveal extensive rehabilitation requirements for facilities idle for 25-30 years. Underground workings may face groundwater infiltration, roof deterioration, and equipment corrosion requiring major investments.

Skilled workforce availability presents challenges in competitive labour markets where experienced mining professionals have multiple employment opportunities. Training programmes require 6-12 months to develop operational competency, potentially constraining production ramp-up schedules.

Capital market conditions affect project financing availability and costs, with current higher interest rates increasing project financing expenses. M&A activity in the mining sector remains sluggish due to high valuations and operational setbacks, potentially limiting financing options.

Equipment availability and delivery timelines create project scheduling challenges, with major mining equipment facing 18-24 month procurement periods. Supply chain constraints affecting mining equipment manufacturers could extend these timelines further.

The electric vehicle (EV) landscape in the U.S. has changed dramatically over the past few months. As of September 30, 2025, the federal EV tax credit program officially expired, ending a decade-long incentive that helped millions of Americans make the switch to electric.

But all is not lost — many state and local incentives, including those in Colorado, are still available to help soften the price of going electric. Here’s where things stand now.

The Federal EV Tax Credit Has Ended

For years, the Clean Vehicle Credit (under Section 30D of the IRS code) provided up to $7,500 toward the purchase of new electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles that met specific assembly, battery, and pricing requirements.

However, under the phase-out provisions passed earlier this year, the program officially ended for vehicles acquired after September 30, 2025. Only buyers who entered into a binding purchase contract with a deposit before that date are eligible to still claim the credit on their 2025 tax return.

Here’s what that means:

No new federal tax credits are available for EVs purchased on or after October 1, 2025.

The used clean vehicle credit (worth up to $4,000) has also expired.

The home EV charger credit remains available through June 30, 2026, providing up to 30% of installation costs (up to $1,000) for home charging equipment.

Some automakers may still offer lease-based incentives that mimic federal credits, since in certain cases the manufacturer (as the lessor) can claim the credit and pass the savings on through reduced lease payments.

Colorado Steps Up: State EV Incentives in 2025–2026

Colorado has long been one of the most EV-friendly states in the country — and that continues even as federal incentives fade.

Current Colorado EV Tax Credits (as of Fall 2025)

$3,500 state income tax credit for new electric vehicles purchased or leased in 2025.

An additional $2,500 bonus credit for vehicles with an MSRP under $35,000.

The credit can be assigned to your dealer or finance company at the time of sale, allowing the savings to be applied upfront as a discount instead of waiting until tax season.

Buyers who assign the credit also qualify for a $600 “assignment bonus.”

These credits apply to new vehicles only, though Colorado has separate programs and grants for commercial EVs and fleet conversions.

What’s Changing Soon

Colorado’s state EV credit is set to decrease again in 2026:

Expected to drop to $1,500 for most EVs.

The bonus for lower-priced models may continue, but likely at a reduced rate.

That means 2025 represents the final high-value year for state incentives — and with federal credits gone, the Colorado credit is now one of the best in the nation.

Other Colorado EV Incentives Still in Play

In addition to the state tax credit, there are still a few other incentives worth noting:

Property Tax Exemption: EV charging stations are exempt from property tax until January 1, 2030.

Utility Rebates: Many electric utilities — including Xcel Energy and Platte River Power Authority — continue to offer rebates for EV chargers or time-of-use rate discounts for EV owners.

Local Grants: Some municipalities, including Denver and Boulder, provide additional rebates or free public charging programs.

What Colorado EV Buyers Should Know Going Forward

Even without federal help, buying an EV in Colorado still comes with tangible financial benefits — but the window for maximum savings is closing fast.

Here’s how to make the most of it:

Buy before 2026 to capture the full $3,500–$6,000 in state incentives.

Ask your dealer about credit assignment so you can see the discount immediately on your purchase agreement.

Check utility and local programs — some stackable rebates can add another few hundred dollars in savings.

Keep an eye on future legislation: both state and federal policymakers are considering successor programs aimed at boosting EV adoption, especially in rural and middle-income markets.

The federal EV tax credit era has officially ended, but the shift toward electric vehicles is far from over. Colorado continues to reward EV buyers with strong incentives, especially for more affordable models.If you’ve been on the fence about going electric, late 2025 may be your last, best opportunity to take advantage of significant savings before next year’s reductions kick in.

As the tax credit’s loss starts to take effect, car companies that have long relied on the $7,500 credit to create sales for themselves are starting to adjust their strategies for sales and their overall transition to electrification.

On Tuesday, General Motors announced it would include a $1.6 billion charge in its upcoming quarterly earnings results from its EV investments.

Ford said in late September that it expects demand for its EVs to be cut in half. Stellantis is abandoning its plan to have only EVs being produced in Europe by 2030, and Chrysler, a brand under the Stellantis umbrella, is bailing on lofty EV sales targets here in the U.S.

How Tesla could benefit from the ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ that axes EV subsidies

The tax credit and EV subsidies have achieved what many of us believed they were doing: masking car companies from the truth about their EV demand. Simply put, their products are not priced attractively enough for what they offer, and there is no true advantage to buying EVs developed by legacy companies.

These tax credits have helped companies simply compete with Tesla, nothing more and nothing less. Without them, their products likely would not have done as well as they have. That’s why these companies are now suddenly backtracking.

It’s something Elon Musk has said all along.

Back in January, during the Q4 and Full Year 2024 Earnings Call, Musk said:

“I think it would be devastating for our competitors and for Tesla slightly. But, long term, it probably actually helps Tesla, that would be my guess.”

In July of last year, Musk said on X:

“Take away all the subsidies. It will only help Tesla.”

Over the past few years, Tesla has started to lose its market share in the U.S., mostly because more companies have entered the EV manufacturing market and more models are being offered.

Nobody has been able to make a sizeable dent in what Tesla has done, and although its market share has gotten smaller, it still holds nearly half of all EV sales in the U.S.

Tesla’s EV Market Share in the U.S. By Year

2020 – 79%

2021 – 72%

2022 – 62%

2023 – 55%

2024 – 49%

As others are adjusting to what they believe will be tempered demand for their EVs, Tesla has just reported its strongest quarter in company history, with just shy of half a million deliveries.

Will Tesla thrive without the EV tax credit? Five reasons why they might

Although Tesla benefited from the EV tax credit, particularly last quarter, some believe it will have a small impact since it has been lost. The company has many other focuses, with its main priority appearing to be autonomy and AI.

One thing is for sure: Musk was right.

Elon Musk has admitted that X’s creator payout system isn’t living up to expectations, and he has highlighted the current system’s biggest flaw.

Amidst complaints about low and inconsistent payments, the platform’s owner acknowledged that X has been “underpaying and not allocating payment accurately enough.” Musk also stated that YouTube manages creator payments “much better.”

Musk acknowledges payout issues

Recent discussions about the social media platform’s payout issues began when X product head Nikita Bier stated that the company was developing new upgrades for “power users.” This prompted X user Peter Duan to raise ongoing concerns about being “consistently underpaid” compared to his peers. Bier responded candidly, suggesting that “creator payouts do more harm than good and we need to off-ramp to a different system.”

Musk then weighed in on the matter, contradicting Bier’s view. “No,” Musk wrote in his reply, “the issue is that we are underpaying and not allocating payment accurately enough. YouTube does a much better job.” The Tesla CEO’s comment immediately reignited debates about X’s monetization program, which some have criticized for its rather unpredictable nature.

X’s monetization challenges

Since X launched its ad revenue-sharing program in 2023, the system has promised to reward Premium subscribers who generate high engagement with verified accounts, as noted in a WION report. Creators, however, have argued that the company’s payout model has remained inconsistent, with revenue fluctuating even when view counts stay stable. Reports have noted that some users with millions of monthly impressions have received just a few hundred dollars.

By contrast, YouTube’s Partner Program, which takes a 45% cut of ad revenue, is known for more transparent and predictable payments. Musk’s admission that YouTube handles monetization more effectively could then hint at a potential shift towards a new monetization program for X, a platform that has become increasingly critical to social conversations over the years.

Tesla has made a last-ditch effort to secure the $56 billion pay package for CEO Elon Musk, which was approved twice by company shareholders, after a Delaware Chancery Court denied the frontman the payday.

Perhaps one of the biggest issues from a standpoint of being fluent in Tesla-related events has been Musk’s pay package.

It was approved by shareholders once in 2018, and required Musk to oversee various growth tranches that would bring investors value. He completed each of the tranches and was entitled to the pay package.

However, the Delaware Chancery Court decided in January 2024 to rescind the pay package, which Musk had earned, based on a suit filed by a shareholder.

Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick ruled that Tesla’s board lacked independence from Musk when the pay package was approved in 2018, and that it should not be granted.

She called it “an unfathomable sum.”

In response to the pay package’s rejection by Chancellor McCormick, Tesla held a second shareholder vote last year, which once again showed investors were willing to support Musk’s payday. It was approved by shareholders, but it was once again denied by the court.

Today, Tesla attorneys argued to the Delaware Supreme Court that the pay package should be restored because of last year’s vote by shareholders.

Jeffrey Wall, an attorney for Tesla, said (via Reuters):

“This was the most informed stockholder vote in Delaware history. Reaffirming that would resolve this case. Shareholders in 2024 knew exactly what they were voting.”

In a response to the decision by the Delaware courts last year, Tesla proposed a new pay package for Musk in September, which would give him a potentially $1 trillion compensation plan. It would require Musk to help Tesla reach several performance-based growth milestones, including achieving an $8.5 trillion market cap.

Elon Musk’s new pay plan ties trillionaire status to Tesla’s $8.5 trillion valuation

Musk is currently worth $483 billion, making him the richest person in the world. If he were to achieve his pay package tranches, granted the new pay package is passed at the Shareholder Meeting in November, he would easily be the first trillionaire.",https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/elon-musk-1-1000x600.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 18:08:37.789750

The current budget impasse is the result of Democratic insistence that the expanded subsidies be extended and Republican insistence that the expanded subsidies expire as scheduled.
If the enhanced subsidies expire, the cap on insurance premium payments as a percentage of income will rise.
Of that, more than $50 billion would go to households with incomes greater than 500% of the federal poverty level.
Considering the large number of Republican voters who would be hurt if the subsidies expire, one would think there is a compromise to be had.","Income-based subsidies have been part of the Affordable Care Act from the beginning. These subsidies take the form of tax credits designed to make health insurance premiums more affordable for low- and middle-income Americans.

During the COVID shutdowns, these subsidies were expanded to cover more people and enhanced to provide greater benefits. These temporary measures were part of the American Rescue Plan of 2021 and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The extra subsidies expire at the end of this year.

The current budget impasse is the result of Democratic insistence that the expanded subsidies be extended and Republican insistence that the expanded subsidies expire as scheduled.

So what exactly are these subsidies, and who gets them?

Two factors are involved. The first is income as a percentage of the federal poverty level. According to health policy nonprofit KFF, enhanced subsidies are available to individuals with household incomes up to 415% of the federal poverty level ($65,000 per year) and families of four with household incomes up to 404% of the federal poverty level ($130,000 per year).

The second factor is the cap on insurance premium payments as a percentage of household income. For individuals and families of four with incomes below 141% of the federal poverty level, enhanced tax credits reduce their premium costs to zero. The net cost increases as income increases topping out at 8.5% of income for those at 400% of the federal poverty level.

If the enhanced subsidies expire, the cap on insurance premium payments as a percentage of income will rise. Instead of paying zero, those earning 115% to 120% of the federal poverty level will pay 2.1% of income in premiums. Individuals and families of four with the highest qualifying incomes will pay 10% rather than 8.5%. Some who currently qualify will be ineligible for subsidies.

All told, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that extending the subsidies would cost $350 billion over the next 10 years. Of that, more than $50 billion would go to households with incomes greater than 500% of the federal poverty level.

As part of its analysis, the Congressional Budget Office presented a series of alternatives short of a full extension that would reduce the 10-year cost.

The debate over the Affordable Care Act extension is a topsy-turvy throwback to the debate earlier this year over the “Big Beautiful Bill.” Back then, the 2017 Trump tax cuts were due to expire at the end of 2026. Extending the tax cuts would increase the budget deficit by $4.5 trillion over the ensuing 10 years. Even though these tax cuts primarily benefited those with higher incomes, the Republicans pushed the BBB over the line.

Now that the issue is $350 billion in tax credits that would primarily go to those with lower incomes, Republicans are digging in their heels out of a supposed concern for fiscal rectitude. Meanwhile, Democrats who opposed the BBB because it mostly benefited the wealthy do not seem to be able to muster any nuance with regard to the way some of the Affordable Care Act subsidies go to those with relatively high incomes.

Considering the large number of Republican voters who would be hurt if the subsidies expire, one would think there is a compromise to be had.

One would think.

Spanish engineering firm Técnicas Reunidas and Chinese energy utility Sinopec have been awarded a front-end engineering design contract

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has been an energy giant in the global arena and, through its vast amount of natural resources developed into a nation that looks like something out of a futuristic sci-fi novel. The megastructures and economic boom in the Kingdom brought standards of living up and positioned investors in the energy sector to make exceedingly large profits.

However, as the global energy industry has shifted towards the renewable energy sector, the oil-rich nations of the world need to foster a more balanced approach. Saudi Arabia is leading the region in that regard, following the announcement that Spanish engineering firm Técnicas Reunidas, in partnership with Chinese energy firm Sinopec, will design and construct what could be a landmark hydrogen and ammonia facility.

The contract was awarded to the consortium by ACWA Power. The facility will become the largest of its kind in the world and positions the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia as a global leader in the adoption and implementation of renewable energy projects.

Saudi Arabia has extensive experience in the efficient commissioning of energy projects that transform the global energy sector’s priorities, leading the charge for more renewable energy projects to become the norm.

Once construction has been completed, the value of the facility will skyrocket to astonishing levels

It has become evident that Saudi Arabia is aiming to lead the global clean energy export sector through innovative green hydrogen and ammonia projects. The facility will boast the production of 400,000 tons of green hydrogen annually.

Sinopec will handle the FEED (Front-end engineering and design) phase, which is set to last approximately 10 months. After that, the Técnicas Reunidas-Sinopec consortium is expected to present the Saudi government with an Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) proposal that could be worth billions of dollars.

The commissioning of the facility is set for 2030; once that takes place, it will position the Kingdom as a leader in the global hydrogen export sector. Other nations like India have also seen biomass-to-hydrogen projects being commissioned recently. The Kingdom’s Energy Minister has delivered a statement that notes his nation’s stance towards the renewable energy sector.

“We as a country, we are no longer called a leading oil-producing country … we would like to be called an energy producing country, all kinds of energy.

Three other coal lease sales from public lands under Trump were successful.","Billings, Mont. – Federal officials rejected a mining company’s bid for 1.3 million tons of coal beneath a national forest in Utah, marking the third proposed coal sale from public lands in the West to fall through this month.

The failed sales mark a setback in President Donald Trump’s push to revive a coal mining industry that’s been in decline for almost two decades.

The Interior Department rejected the sole bid it received for coal on a proposed 120-acre (49-hectare) lease on the Manti-La Sal National Forest near central Utah’s Skyline Mine because it did not meet the requirements of the Mineral Leasing Act, agency spokesperson Alyse Sharpe said Thursday.

The leasing act requires companies to pay fair market value for coal mined on public lands. Sharpe declined to say how much was bid. The sale was requested by a subsidiary of Utah mining company Wolverine Fuels LLC, which operates the Skyline Mine and other coal mines in central Utah.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said two weeks ago that the government will open 13 million acres of federal lands for coal mining. But it’s unclear who would want that fuel as utilities turn to cheaper natural gas and renewables such as wind and solar to generate electricity.

Emissions from burning coal are a leading driver of climate change that’s raising sea levels and making weather more extreme.

On Oct. 6, a coal sale from public lands in Montana that would have been the largest by the government in more than a decade drew a single bid of $186,000, or about one-tenth of a penny per ton of coal, and was later rejected. That lease held 167 million tons of coal in southeastern Montana near the Navajo Transition Energy Co.'s Spring Creek mine.

Two days later the Interior Department postponed an even bigger sale – 440 million tons next to the Navajo Nation-owned company's Antelope Mine in Wyoming.

Sharpe repeated the Republican Trump administration's assertion that the policies of former Presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama were to blame for the failed sales, saying the Democrats tried ""to dismantle domestic production and shake investor confidence in the industry.""

Both Democrats attempted to curb sales of coal from public lands, only to have those policies reversed by Trump.

Three other coal lease sales from public lands under Trump were successful. The largest, in Alabama, involved 54 million tons of coal used in steelmaking that sold last month for $46 million, or about 87 cents per ton. Two recent sales in North Dakota of leases containing a combined 30 million tons of coal brought in $186,000 total, or less than a penny per ton.

“As demand for reliable, dispatchable power grows, coal remains a critical component of ensuring affordable and dependable energy for the American people,” Sharpe said in a statement.

But industry analysts and economists say the biggest driver of coal's retreat has been market forces that make other fuels more economical. Many power plants served by large mines on public lands in the West are nearing retirement.

Environmentalists have fought for years against the expansion of Utah's Skyline Mine. Emma Yip with the Center for Biological Diversity described the bid rejection as “yet another face-plant for the Trump administration"" as it tries to prop up a dying industry.

“Coal is among the dirtiest energy sources on Earth and burning it continues to sicken and kill Americans. There’s no defensible reason to keep it on life support when absolutely nobody wants it,” Yip said.","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/16/PDTN/86729712007-ap-25188721833067.jpg?crop=3065,1724,x0,y818&width=3065&height=1724&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-10-16 15:08:53.079426

Additionally, the site will feature a battery storage system and could provide crucial power to 102,000 homes. The landmark solar park features an array of over 550,000 solar photovoltaic modules and has been classified as a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project (NSIP) for the UK. Cleve Hill was granted development consent by the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy in May 2020.

The Clevel Hill Solar Park is now operating at full capacity and exporting energy at 100%

The world has been consumed by the current transition away from the non-renewable energy sector towards projects like Clevel Hill that accelerate the global transition to the renewable energy sector. Projects across the world are popping up that strengthen the prominence of wind power in the global energy industry.

Cleve Hill serves as a landmark achievement for the UK energy sector. It was the first project of its kind that was consented as a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project (“NSIP”). The site’s contractor, Quinbrook Infrastructure Partners, has announced the successful completion of construction and has noted that operations on site are underway.

The site’s 373 MW capacity is more than four times the size of the next largest operational UK solar project. Cleve Hill is supported by the largest solar and battery storage project financing in UK history. Quinbrook, the site’s operator, received a GBP 218.5 million term loan and a GBP 20 million VAT facility with Lloyds and NatWest, which exemplifies the nation’s cooperative approach to the solar sector.

“Cleve Hill sets a new benchmark for large-scale solar projects to help decarbonise the UK power system and demonstrates how investing in the infrastructure needed to transition the UK to clean energy can support local communities and create new jobs. The UK’s ongoing commitment to progress its energy transition and decarbonise the economy represents a strong conviction as a nation to a renewable energy future, one that is underpinned by a huge pipeline of large-scale infrastructure projects that will support growth, jobs and cheaper power for UK households.” – Keith Gains, Managing Director and UK Regional Leader for Quinbrook

The Cleve Hill Solar Park helps to shift the UK energy sector towards the potential of solar power

The UK, along with every other nation that signed on to the Paris Agreement, is working exceedingly hard to decarbonize the energy sector. The global consensus calls for more work to be done to reach the emission goals that were agreed upon at the Paris Agreement Summit a few years ago.

Several high-energy usage nations are building huge solar farms that further the progress of transitioning the global energy sector towards the renewable energy sector. The landmark project has the potential to reduce carbon emissions by more than 142,000 tonnes during the first year of operations. Additionally, the site will provide 2,500 direct and indirect jobs.

“Quinbrook is proud to further enhance our track record of successfully delivering milestone infrastructure projects that create such a meaningful and positive impact for the UK’s energy transition. Projects like Cleve Hill set new scale benchmarks that should increase confidence that the UK’s renewables targets can be achieved” – Rory Quinlan, Quinbrook’s Co-Founder and Managing Partner

Texas Border Business

McALLEN, Texas — The City of McAllen has announced one of the most ambitious development projects in its history: the transformation of the long-discussed Boeye Reservoir site into a vibrant, mixed-use destination designed to attract investment, tourism, and long-term economic growth.

During a press conference, Mayor Javier Villalobos described the announcement as “a historic and momentous occasion” for McAllen. “It’s such a pleasure and honor to be here for what is probably one of the biggest projects that the City of McAllen has ever had,” Villalobos said. “We’re talking about a project that is changing McAllen — the way we are, the way we think — and we’re bringing together the public, private, and community sectors like never before.”

The initiative, also referred to as the Boeye Project, represents a $230 million investment spanning 70 acres and will feature premium condominiums, luxury hotels, new water attractions, and an expansive recreational district, along with dining, retail, and entertainment spaces. The development aims to become a significant economic engine for South Texas while redefining McAllen as a regional hub for innovation and lifestyle.

Villalobos emphasized the project’s collaborative foundation, citing decades of effort by city leaders and previous administrations. “For decades, we’ve talked about the development of the Boeye Reservoir,” he said. “Past commissions and mayors saw the vision but couldn’t bring it to life—not because they didn’t want to, but because it was difficult. Today, we’re making it happen because we’ve done it right.”

He added that McAllen’s approach reflects a commitment to integrity and sustainability. “McAllen will not do something that is not right,” Villalobos stated. “We went back, revised, and refined the plan because McAllen will never do anything that is ever going to fail. This isn’t just a project—it’s a legacy.”

According to City Manager Isaac Tawil, the Boeye project will be “a transformative mixed-use development designed to elevate McAllen’s regional tourism appeal, enhance lifestyle amenities, and drive sustainable economic growth.” Tawil noted that the city’s vision aligns with national trends toward integrated, experience-driven destinations. “We’re not just adding a new development,” Tawil said. “We’re building a destination that will redefine what it means to live, learn, and invest in South Texas.”

The premium mixed-use design will combine modern residential spaces with vibrant public attractions, positioning McAllen as a prime destination for both residents and visitors. The new recreational district, anchored by innovative water attractions and lifestyle amenities, will complement the surrounding high-end condominiums, hotels, and entertainment venues, creating a thriving, multi-dimensional destination for business, leisure, and community gatherings.

The economic projections emphasize that vision. During construction, the project is expected to support over 2,200 jobs and generate $95 million in labor income, contributing approximately $136 million to GDP and $330 million in total economic output. Once complete, the site is projected to attract 460,000 visitors annually, generating $35.6 million in visitor spending and sustaining 900 permanent jobs with $26 million in wages each year.

Tawil also highlighted McAllen’s strong fiscal foundation, citing the city’s $580 million budget and $170 million dedicated to capital improvement projects. “With record-breaking sales taxes exceeding $96 million last year, McAllen offers one of the most stable and business-friendly environments in the state,” he said. “For investors, that means confidence and opportunity.”

The project’s master plan envisions a world-class environment where modern architecture and leisure coexist. The site’s strategic location—adjacent to expressways, the McAllen International Airport, and key retail corridors—positions it as a gateway for commerce, tourism, and regional connectivity.

Villalobos reiterated that the city’s partnership model ensures transparency and accountability. “Developers will be held accountable to ensure transparency and honesty,” he said. “There will be benchmarks—and that includes the city. This project will happen the right way, with collaboration and community at its heart.”

The city officially released a Request for Proposals (RFP) for developers on the morning of the announcement, inviting qualified partners to participate in shaping McAllen’s next landmark destination. Interested parties can access full details at mcallenmeansbusiness.com and through the City of McAllen’s procurement website.

City officials emphasized that the Boeye project is designed not only as a commercial success but as a long-term community asset. “This is more than a project—it’s a promise,” Tawil said. “It’s a declaration that McAllen’s best years are yet to come.”

Villalobos concluded with optimism about what the development means for the city’s future. “This is a new McAllen,” he said. “A McAllen that dreams big, delivers bigger, and stands united in purpose. We’re not just building structures—we’re building our legacy.”

The loan guarantee to AEP was among those conditionally approved under Biden, a fact Wright acknowledged to reporters.","WASHINGTON(AP) — The Department of Energy said Thursday it has finalized a $1.6 billion loan guarantee to a subsidiary of one of the nation's largest power companies to upgrade nearly 5,000 miles of transmission lines across five states, mostly in the Midwest, for largely fossil fuel-run energy.

AEP Transmission will upgrade power lines in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia to enhance enhance grid reliability and capacity, the Energy Department said. The project, first offered under the Biden administration, is meant to help meet surging electricity demand from data centers and artificial intelligence.

Ohio-based American Electric Power, which owns AEP Transmission, is one of the nation's largest utilities, serving 5.6 million customers in 11 states. It primarily produces electricity from coal, natural gas and nuclear power, along with renewable resources such as wind and hydroelectric power.

Thursday's announcement deepens the Trump administration’s commitment to traditional, polluting energy sources even as it works to discourage the U.S. from clean energy use.

Earlier this month, the administration cancelled $7.6 billion in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election. A total of 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable, the Energy Department said.

The cancellations include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub aimed at developing clean-burning hydrogen fuels to power ships and heavy-duty trucks. A hydrogen project costing up to $1 billion in the Pacific Northwest also was cancelled.

The loan guarantee finalized Thursday is the first offered by the Trump administration under the recently renamed Energy Dominance Financing program created by the massive tax-and-spending law approved this summer by congressional Republicans and signed by President Donald Trump. Electric utilities that receive loans through the program must provide assurances to the government that financial benefits from the financing will be passed on to customers, the Energy Department said.

The project and others being considered will help ensure that Americans ""will have access to affordable, reliable and secure energy for decades to come,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement.

“The president has been clear: America must reverse course from the energy subtraction agenda of past administrations and strengthen our electrical grid,'' Wright said, adding that modernizing the grid and expanding transmission capacity ""will help position the United States to win the AI race and grow our manufacturing base.”

The upgrades supported by the federal financing will replace existing transmission lines in existing rights-of-way with new lines capable of carrying more energy, the power company said.

More than 2,000 miles of transmission lines in Ohio serving 1.5 million people will be replaced, along with more than 1,400 miles in Indiana and Michigan serving 600,000 customers, the company said. An additional 1,400 miles in Oklahoma, serving about 1.2 million people and 26 miles in West Virginia, serving 460,000 people, will be replaced.

The projects will create about 1,100 construction jobs, the company said.

The loan guarantee will save customers money and improve reliability while supporting economic growth in the five states, said Bill Fehrman, AEP's chairman, president and chief executive officer. “The funds we will save through this program enable us to make additional investments to enhance service for our customers,"" he added.

Wright, in a conference call with reporters, distinguished the AEP loan guarantee from a $4.9 billion federal loan guarantee the department cancelled in July. That money would have boosted the planned Grain Belt Express, a new high-voltage transmission line set to deliver solar and wind-generated electricity from the Midwest to eastern states.

The Energy Department said at the time it was “not critical for the federal government to have a role” in the first phase of the $11 billion project planned by Chicago-based Invenergy. The department also questioned whether the project could meet strict financial conditions required, a claim Wright repeated Thursday.

“Ultimately that is a commercial enterprise that needs private developers,” Wright said. The company has indicated the Grain Belt project will go forward.

Trump and Wright have repeatedly derided wind and solar energy as unreliable and opposed efforts to combat climate change by moving away from fossil fuels. Wright said the Grain Belt Express loan was among billions of dollars worth of commitments “rushed out the door” in the waning days of former President Joe Biden’s administration.

It’s clear that policy change is needed to address the compounding loss in gas tax revenue as a result of widespread EV adoption.","Electric vehicles are more popular than ever, with 21% of new car sales in the United States being either electric, hybrid, or plug-in hybrid models. One of the unintended consequences of this consumer trend is the effect on gas tax revenue.

Every gasoline and diesel sale in the U.S. includes a small added tax. This tax is used to fund state transportation budgets, highway maintenance, and infrastructure projects. As a result of more EVs on the road, the amount of revenue generated by the gas tax is decreasing. This has created interesting financial repercussions, and a variety of solutions are being adopted to help.

Using state-by-state fuel tax data from the Department of Energy and consumer EV trends from the Alternative Fuels Data Center, CheapInsurance.com analyzed the economic impact of the changing transportation landscape and what’s being done to remedy the situation.

Nationwide EV adoption trends

Millions of Americans are choosing to purchase electric vehicles over traditional gas ones. The reasons include reduced charging costs compared to gas, lower emissions, and tax incentives.

The Bureau of Transportation Statistics reported that, in 2024, there were 1.2 million electric vehicle sales and 1.6 million hybrid electric vehicle sales. This is up from 238,000 EV sales and 455,000 hybrid-electric sales in 2020. This upward trend is likely to continue.

New EV registrations by state

The rate at which EVs are being bought and put on the road differs by state. This is mainly influenced by government policies, cultural attitudes, and economic factors.

For example, California has recently tried to enact an EV mandate that requires a certain percentage of new vehicle sales to be fully electric. This plan was then adopted by 11 other states. Although later blocked by the Senate, this prompted many consumers to transition to EVs.

Culturally, many Americans across the country do not want EVs, which explains lower purchase numbers in some states. The Pew Research Center found that, in May 2025, only 18% of Republicans and Republican-leaning individuals were at least somewhat interested in purchasing one. This is compared to Democrats, with 48% somewhat or very interested. This data was collected via a survey of Americans conducted from April 28 to May 4, 2025. This suggests that “red states” will have lower numbers of EV registrations than “blue states.”

A look at gas tax revenue loss in key EV states

The states with the highest EV registration numbers per 100,000 residents have the most significant loss in gas tax revenue. The number of EV vehicles on the road compared to gasoline vehicles is still quite low, so impacts are not being strongly felt yet. However, many states are predicting substantial losses in their gas tax revenue over the next decade.

In California, for example, the Mineta Transportation Institute predicts that there will be a 64% loss in revenue from 2025 to 2040. In this study, researchers considered eight different scenarios, each with a different rate of how many EVs are purchased, how many people in the state drive, and how many personal vehicles get registered. Results used 2024 inflation-adjusted numbers.

Budget impacts on state transportation departments

Millions of dollars in losses will have a severe impact on state highway and transportation departments if left unaddressed. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 2024 data pulled from the National Association of State Budget Officers states that gas tax revenue accounts for 35.9% of state transportation department revenue nationwide.

Without this revenue, several impacts will be felt:

Deficits in highway and road maintenance

Slower completion of infrastructure projects

Less development and expansion

Higher vehicle maintenance costs for the general population

How states are responding and planning for the future

States are recognizing that action needs to be taken to secure transportation budgets. Pew Research Center reports that many states are suffering from budget gaps and are having difficulty completing projects like bridge repairs.

To tackle the issue of reduced gas tax revenue, many states have begun taking measures and implementing programs that will generate revenue from electric vehicles instead.

EV registration fees

The most significant way that governmental bodies have buoyed transportation department revenue is with EV registration fees. These fees are charged at the initial time of registration and on an annual basis.

In Texas, for example, EV owners must pay $400 for the first-time registration and $200 each year, according to the Department of Energy.

Road usage charges

Other states are opting for a road usage fee. In Hawai‘i, EV owners are given the option to pay an annual, per-mile usage fee instead of a large registration fee. This is currently set at $0.08/mile, up to $50/year.

Oregon offers a similar program, called OReGO. California is also experimenting with its own pilot program.

What changes are needed on the road ahead?

It’s clear that policy change is needed to address the compounding loss in gas tax revenue as a result of widespread EV adoption. The amount of revenue that will need to be replaced is unclear, however, especially with an anticipated decline in EV demand due to the federal tax incentives ending.

Regardless, state agencies and the federal government will need to prioritize alternative methods for generating revenue. This could be through registration fees, road usage programs, or other revenue-generating systems that are put into place. It’s likely that the EV marketplace will continue to grow and that more households will begin replacing their gas vehicles, so prompt change is needed in the coming years.",https://krdo.b-cdn.net/2025/10/cheapinsurance-gas-taxes.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 16:10:38.316759

A total of 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable, the Energy Department said.
Electric utilities that receive loans through the program must provide assurances to the government that financial benefits from the financing will be passed on to customers, the Energy Department said.
The loan guarantee will save customers money and improve reliability while supporting economic growth in the five states, said Bill Fehrman, AEP’s chairman, president and chief executive officer.
Wright, in a conference call with reporters, distinguished the AEP loan guarantee from a $4.9 billion federal loan guarantee the department cancelled in July.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Department of Energy said Thursday it has finalized a $1.6 billion loan guarantee to a subsidiary of one of the nation’s largest power companies to upgrade nearly 5,000 miles of transmission lines across five states, mostly in the Midwest, for largely fossil fuel-run energy.

AEP Transmission will upgrade power lines in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia, primarily to enhance enhance grid reliability and capacity, the Energy Department said. The project by AEP Transmission, a subsidiary of Ohio-based American Electric Power, is meant to help meet surging electricity demand from data centers and artificial intelligence.

AEP primarily produces electricity from coal, natural gas and nuclear power, along with renewable resources such as wind and hydroelectric power.

Thursday’s announcement deepens the Trump administration’s commitment to traditional, polluting energy sources even as it works to discourage the U.S. from clean energy use.

The move comes as the Trump administration has moved to cancel $7.6 billion in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election. A total of 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable, the Energy Department said.

The cancellations include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub aimed at producing clean-burning hydrogen fuels to power ships and heavy-duty trucks. A hydrogen project costing up to $1 billion in the Pacific Northwest also was cancelled.

The loan guarantee finalized Thursday is the first offered by the Trump administration under the recently renamed Energy Dominance Financing program created by the massive tax-and-spending law approved this summer by congressional Republicans and signed by President Donald Trump. Electric utilities that receive loans through the program must provide assurances to the government that financial benefits from the financing will be passed on to customers, the Energy Department said.

The project and others being considered will help ensure that Americans “will have access to affordable, reliable and secure energy for decades to come,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement.

“The president has been clear: America must reverse course from the energy subtraction agenda of past administrations and strengthen our electrical grid,” Wright said, adding that modernizing the grid and expanding transmission capacity “will help position the United States to win the AI race and grow our manufacturing base.”

The upgrades supported by the federal financing will replace existing transmission lines in existing rights-of-way with new lines capable of carrying more energy, the power company said.

More than 2,000 miles of transmission lines in Ohio serving 1.5 million people will be replaced, along with more than 1,400 miles in Indiana and Michigan serving 600,000 customers, the company said. An additional 1,400 miles in Oklahoma, serving about 1.2 million people and 26 miles in West Virginia, serving 460,000 people, will be replaced.

The projects will create about 1,100 construction jobs, the company said.

The loan guarantee will save customers money and improve reliability while supporting economic growth in the five states, said Bill Fehrman, AEP’s chairman, president and chief executive officer. “The funds we will save through this program enable us to make additional investments to enhance service for our customers,” he added.

Wright, in a conference call with reporters, distinguished the AEP loan guarantee from a $4.9 billion federal loan guarantee the department cancelled in July. That money would have boosted the planned Grain Belt Express, a new high-voltage transmission line set to deliver solar and wind-generated electricity from the Midwest to eastern states.

The Energy Department said at the time it was “not critical for the federal government to have a role” in the first phase of the $11 billion project planned by Chicago-based Invenergy. The department also questioned whether the project could meet strict financial conditions required, a claim Wright repeated Thursday.

“Ultimately that is a commercial enterprise that needs private developers,” Wright said. The company has indicated the Grain Belt project will go forward.

Trump and Wright have repeatedly derided wind and solar energy as unreliable and opposed efforts to combat climate change by moving away from fossil fuels. Wright said the Grain Belt Express loan was among billions of dollars worth of commitments “rushed out the doors” by former President Joe Biden’s administration after the 2024 election.",https://www.qcnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/109/2025/10/68f133ed4a34b7.64013515.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-16 15:09:13.717778

American Electric Power’s transmission subsidiary, AEP Transmission, closed on a $1.6 billion loan guarantee from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office (LPO).

The funding will support upgrades to nearly 5,000 miles of transmission lines in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, and West Virginia.

American Electric Power said the project will save customers approximately $275 million over the life of the loan through lower financing costs reflected in utility bills.

The project involves replacing aging lines within existing rights-of-way with higher-capacity infrastructure, boosting grid reliability and efficiency.

American Electric Power estimates the initiative will generate about 1,100 construction jobs while strengthening the company’s ability to meet growing energy demand, particularly from sectors such as artificial intelligence, data centers, and manufacturing.

The company projects that new and expanding customers will drive an additional 24 gigawatts of electricity demand by 2030.

Bill Fehrman, American Electric Power’s Chairman, President, and CEO, said that the DOE-backed financing will help lower customer costs, improve reliability, and enable further investment in modernization initiatives.

American Electric Power outlined the scope of its grid modernization by state, noting that Ohio Transco will handle 76 projects covering about 2,122 miles of transmission lines serving 1.5 million customers.

Indiana & Michigan (I&M) Transco will oversee 29 projects spanning 1,410 miles for roughly 600,000 customers. In Oklahoma, 17 projects will replace 1,434 miles of lines reaching 1.2 million customers. West Virginia will see four projects covering 26 miles, benefiting approximately 460,000 customers.

Approximately 100 miles of the first upgraded lines will be in Ohio and Oklahoma, with additional projects to follow.

The modernized grid will help American Electric Power handle record-breaking load growth while supporting the nation’s transition toward cleaner energy sources and digital infrastructure expansion.

The funds would have supported more than 12,000 households in North Carolina, helping families save an average of 20% on their utility bills while creating local energy jobs, according to a release by the attorney general's office.

“These funds were going to help low-income and rural North Carolinians save money on their energy bills,” Jackson said. “Thousands of families were going to have the option to install solar power, save money, and have another energy option after a major storm. Now the EPA has illegally cancelled those funds, so I’m going to court to bring $150 million back to our state.”

Department of Environmental Quality Secretary Reid Wilson said the program’s cancellation would prevent rooftop solar installation for thousands of families, reduce energy resilience, and limit job creation.

“Rooftop solar drives down utility bills, reduces air pollution and creates jobs,"" Wilson said. ""The program’s cancellation would hurt the electric grid’s ability to be resilient to future disasters and would hamper North Carolina’s efforts to ensure reliable, clean, and affordable energy supplies.""

The Solar for All program, created under the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, was designed to provide grants for low-income households, multifamily housing, medically vulnerable residents, and community solar pilot programs. North Carolina applied for the program in 2024 and was awarded $156 million to create at least 43 megawatts of solar energy over five years. Without the funding, these households cannot afford to install rooftop solar or benefit from the energy savings.

The program would have also helped families maintain power during outages caused by natural disasters, the release said. When Hurricane Helene hit North Carolina, nearly 1.2 million Duke Energy customers lost electricity, some for weeks. Households with solar panels can store energy and continue to generate electricity even during grid blackouts.

Solar for All was also expected to create local jobs for contractors, construction workers, and maintenance staff, adding roughly 140 new positions in rural areas. Solar energy currently employs more than 9,000 North Carolinians across more than 200 businesses.

In a letter to Jackson, solar business leaders said the EPA’s cancellation would “deny small businesses the benefits of those investments that they have planned for in anticipation of the program.”

North Carolina went through a rigorous application process, including submitting tracking data and regular reports to ensure the program helped low-income households. The EPA awarded the state $156 million in July 2024 but abruptly cancelled the grants in August.

In their lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, the states argue the EPA violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the U.S. Constitution’s Separation of Powers Doctrine.

“We see a missing piece in this orderbook strategy—the absence of nuclear waste disposal,” said Rod Baltzer, CEO of Deep Isolation.
“By embedding disposal into their orderbook strategy, first mover states can reduce financial risk, increase investor confidence, and build public trust that advanced nuclear comes with a complete lifecycle solution.” Baltzer added that Deep Isolation’s deep borehole drilling technology, adapted from the oil and gas industry, along with the company’s disposal canister system, can play a key role in helping states meet its nuclear waste challenges.
“The orderbook approach moves away from one-off demonstrations to propel widespread market adoption by building a robust demand signal for the most viable advanced nuclear technologies,” NASEO said.

Baltzer added that Deep Isolation’s deep borehole drilling technology, adapted from the oil and gas industry, along with the company’s disposal canister system, can play a key role in helping states meet its nuclear waste challenges.

Background: Facilitated by NASEO, Idaho National Laboratory, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and the Department of Energy’s Gateway for Accelerated Innovation in Nuclear, the Advanced Nuclear First Mover Initiative is being led by state cochairs New York, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Wyoming, with participating states Louisiana, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Utah, Virginia, and West Virginia.

According to NASEO, the governors of these states are committed to working with the private sector, the DOE, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to accelerate advanced nuclear projects and bring more power to the electric grid for reliability, sustainability, and economic growth.

On September 16, NASEO issued a request for information on the initiative to provide the organization and first mover states with information on a potential structure for an advanced nuclear project orderbook strategy, status and use cases for different nuclear technologies, and investment and coordination models.

“The orderbook approach moves away from one-off demonstrations to propel widespread market adoption by building a robust demand signal for the most viable advanced nuclear technologies,” NASEO said.

The deadline for the RFI was recently extended from October 10 to October 17.

Recommendations: Noting that the lack of a safe, permanent waste solution remains one of Americans’ top concerns about nuclear power, Deep Isolation said its recommendations draw on consensus across the advanced reactor industry, as reflected in the U.S. Nuclear Industry Council’s “Action Plan for Transforming the Back End of the U.S. Nuclear Fuel Cycle.”

“Deep Isolation calls on NASEO to integrate USNIC’s recommendations into its orderbook strategy: working collaboratively with communities to accelerating innovative disposal technologies, launching near-term demonstrations, and mobilizing private investment through public-private partnerships and legislative reform,” the company said.

Deep Isolation’s submission highlights three specific calls to action for participating states:

Join the Deep Borehole Demonstration Center, a Cameron, Texas, nonprofit where the company plans to conduct a full-scale nonradioactive deep borehole disposal pilot with initial canister emplacement targeted for 2027.

Support early borehole demonstrations in their states, including via joint initiatives with the DOE at federal laboratories such as INL or ORNL (consistent with President Trump’s Executive Order 14302 to leverage these sites for innovative nuclear demonstrations).

Ohio-based American Electric Power, which owns AEP Transmission, is one of the nation's largest utilities, serving 5.6 million customers in 11 states. It primarily produces electricity from coal, natural gas and nuclear power, along with renewable resources such as wind and hydroelectric power.

Thursday's announcement deepens the Trump administration’s commitment to traditional, polluting energy sources even as it works to discourage the U.S. from clean energy use.

Earlier this month, the administration cancelled $7.6 billion in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election. A total of 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable, the Energy Department said.

The cancellations include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub aimed at developing clean-burning hydrogen fuels to power ships and heavy-duty trucks. A hydrogen project costing up to $1 billion in the Pacific Northwest also was cancelled.

The loan guarantee finalized Thursday is the first offered by the Trump administration under the recently renamed Energy Dominance Financing program created by the massive tax-and-spending law approved this summer by congressional Republicans and signed by President Donald Trump. Electric utilities that receive loans through the program must provide assurances to the government that financial benefits from the financing will be passed on to customers, the Energy Department said.

The project and others being considered will help ensure that Americans ""will have access to affordable, reliable and secure energy for decades to come,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement.

“The president has been clear: America must reverse course from the energy subtraction agenda of past administrations and strengthen our electrical grid,'' Wright said, adding that modernizing the grid and expanding transmission capacity ""will help position the United States to win the AI race and grow our manufacturing base.”

The upgrades supported by the federal financing will replace existing transmission lines in existing rights-of-way with new lines capable of carrying more energy, the power company said.

More than 2,000 miles of transmission lines in Ohio serving 1.5 million people will be replaced, along with more than 1,400 miles in Indiana and Michigan serving 600,000 customers, the company said. An additional 1,400 miles in Oklahoma, serving about 1.2 million people and 26 miles in West Virginia, serving 460,000 people, will be replaced.

The projects will create about 1,100 construction jobs, the company said.

The loan guarantee will save customers money and improve reliability while supporting economic growth in the five states, said Bill Fehrman, AEP's chairman, president and chief executive officer. “The funds we will save through this program enable us to make additional investments to enhance service for our customers,"" he added.

Wright, in a conference call with reporters, distinguished the AEP loan guarantee from a $4.9 billion federal loan guarantee the department cancelled in July. That money would have boosted the planned Grain Belt Express, a new high-voltage transmission line set to deliver solar and wind-generated electricity from the Midwest to eastern states.

The Energy Department said at the time it was “not critical for the federal government to have a role” in the first phase of the $11 billion project planned by Chicago-based Invenergy. The department also questioned whether the project could meet strict financial conditions required, a claim Wright repeated Thursday.

“Ultimately that is a commercial enterprise that needs private developers,” Wright said. The company has indicated the Grain Belt project will go forward.

Trump and Wright have repeatedly derided wind and solar energy as unreliable and opposed efforts to combat climate change by moving away from fossil fuels. Wright said the Grain Belt Express loan was among billions of dollars worth of commitments “rushed out the door” in the waning days of former President Joe Biden’s administration.

The loan guarantee to AEP was among those conditionally approved under Biden, a fact Wright acknowledged to reporters.

“Not all of the (Biden-era) projects were nonsense,"" he said, adding that he was “happy to move forward” with the transmission upgrade.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/TVm2eUSrazhBCBkUeO5XFA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/425c5094ec7dc0feef7cc628f2465074,N,,2025-10-16 17:09:24.673002

Commodifying a carcinogen: Critical raw materials from arsenic-laden groundwater.","Arsenic is a double-edged sword. It is a known carcinogen found naturally at high levels in groundwater. But it is also an element that is critical for clean energy technologies such as solar cells.

Connecting those two flows, researchers have found a way to convert the arsenic in groundwater into pure arsenic nanoparticles that can be used in manufacturing. “The creation of valuable [critical raw materials] from carcinogenic treatment by-products is a potentially disruptive technology for the water sector that can alter global [arsenic] supply chains,” Kaifeng Wang and Case M. van Genuchten, geochemists at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, write in a paper published in the journal Science Advances.

Arsenic, which occurs naturally in rocks, soils, and water, is highly toxic. Long-term exposure to the element, typically because of contaminated groundwater, can cause a range of adverse health effects, including neurological impairment in children, cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes.

But the element is also useful in various clean energy technologies. It goes in the metal alloys used in batteries, for instance. And gallium arsenide semiconductors are vital for making high-efficiency solar cells and the high-performance computer chips that go in electronics and telecommunications devices.

Most of the world’s arsenic is mined and produced in China today. Because of the element’s use in technologies and its constrained supply chain, the US and the EU both list it as a critical raw material.

Arsenic usually exists in groundwater in the form of arsenate or arsenite ions. Around the world, treatment with iron oxide particles is an established way to remove these arsenic compounds from groundwater. The process creates a concentrated solid sludge that is difficult to dispose.

The Danish researchers came up with a two-stage chemical process to recover and reuse the arsenic in groundwater. First, they extract arsenic from the solid sludge using an alkali solution . The next step involves treating the extracted arsenic with a common sulfur-bearing chemical called thiourea dioxide. This process gives pure metallic arsenic nanoparticles.

“This work sets the foundation for rethinking the role of As treatment as a dual service that provides safe drinking water and generates local sources of critical raw materials,” the research duo writes.

Indiana lawmakers are weighing new rules to address what local officials call “cable pollution,” or the growing problem of unused or sagging wires left behind by telecom companies along streets and public rights-of-way.

At a Statehouse hearing last Wednesday, Franklin, Ind., Mayor Steve Barnett (R) — whose city sits about 20 minutes south of Indianapolis — blamed telecom companies for leaving behind miles of low-hanging and buried cables. He said his city has spent about $60,000 locating and removing unused lines.

“We shouldn’t have to spend taxpayer dollars fixing the telecoms’ problems,” he said. “It’s time for some oversight.”

Rep. Michelle Davis, R-Whiteland, and Rep. Robb Greene, R-Shelbyville, authored House Bill 1480 earlier this year to set standards for installing and maintaining telecom lines. Lawmakers said they are now considering similar legislation for the 2026 session after the bill received a hearing but no vote in 2025.

Lobbyists for AT&T and Comcast argued that new state mandates would duplicate existing oversight and slow broadband deployment.

AT&T lobbyist Steve Rogers said adding layers of regulation could “slow down investment and deployment” and warned that giving cities broad enforcement powers would create “huge bureaucracies.”

Rogers told lawmakers that telecoms already follow strict safety and construction rules.

“We are subject to the National Electric Safety Code,” he said. “We’re subject to 811, ‘Call Before You Dig’ regulations, and FCC pole-attachment rules. The idea that there are no rules and we need to give cities and towns the ability to fine people — that is just not the case.”

Oversight currently rests with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission and the Federal Communications Commission, but lawmakers remain divided on whether that was enough.

Sen. Rick Niemeyer, R-Lowell, backed local control, while Sen. Greg Taylor, D-Indianapolis, called for statewide rules and line identifiers to assign responsibility.

For some of us, that’s a truck hauling gear or navigating rough roads in remote areas. For others, it’s a sedan for a daily commute or running errands. For those that can’t afford a car, it may be a bike or a bus.

Thousands of people and local businesses across the state—in both rural and urban areas—are already driving electric cars and trucks and finding them to be a great option for doing what they need them to do.

The Natural Resources Council of Maine (NRCM) attended several National Drive Electric Week events in October to hear directly from Mainers about their experience driving electric cars and trucks. Here’s some of what we heard.

These drivers were excited to share their stories in the hope that it would help their neighbors form an accurate perception of electric vehicles. And sharing their stories might help those who are considering an electric car or truck for their next vehicle make a more informed decision.

Ted, Waterford, Ford F-150 Lightning

Ted’s electric truck comes in handy around the farm, for driving across rough terrain but also to power the pressurized fans used in his two greenhouses. He bought it two years ago using the federal tax credit made possible by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Although bison are no longer on the farm, the license plate is a nice homage to the expansive livestock he has kept there.

Brenda, Norway, Chevy Bolt

A co-owner of the Norway Brewing Company, Brenda is a community staple in Norway and a steadfast advocate for downtown revitalization. She uses public charging often, especially on her trips to Connecticut and Long Island to visit family. She now has all of her favorite charging stops mapped out in her head (with the occasional help of her PlugShare app, of course). Her interest in EVs was first sparked at a Ride and Drive event. When she first purchased her car in 2023, she received a $500 charging gift card, which she still hasn’t used up!

Craig, Wells, Chevy Bolt EUV

Craig got his most recent EV at a used car dealership and qualified for the $4,000 used EV tax credit under the Inflation Reduction Act. Paired with his 24 rooftop solar panels at home and his 6 home batteries (both of which qualified for tax credits), he’s making the most of an electrified set up. If the power goes out, he can charge off his battery bank until the power is restored, while also using the batteries as a backup home generator. Since he purchased it in 2023, the Bolt has required zero maintenance.

City of Bangor, Ford F-150 Lightning, Hyundai Ioniq 6, Polaris Ranger EV

The City of Bangor is rapidly electrifying its municipal fleet, boasting a number of models for different use purposes. The Public Works Department was showing off its recent Polaris Ranger EV, an offroad 4-wheeler that can be easily charged from a 120V wall outlet. This smaller vehicle allows for quiet offroad access, rain or shine, as the Public Works team keeps city infrastructure working for Bangor residents.

Zack, Raymond, Honda Prologue

Zack caught the EV bug after test-driving a Chevy Bolt at a previous EV ride and drive event and hasn’t looked back since. He’s leasing his new Honda Prologue in order to qualify for the federal tax credit and commutes half an hour to work both ways without a problem. In fact, he said one of his favorite features is the remote start, which allows him to heat up his car during the winter months in the garage or parking lot before he gets behind the wheel. After doing the math for his home set up, he estimates that the Prologue costs $8-9 to fully charge, a fraction of the cost of a tank of gas.

Fred, Norway, Nomad Taiga Snowmobile

Fred is a legend in the Maine EV community, becoming the first EV owner in Maine when he bought a Nissan Leaf in 2012. He’s been all EV ever since. He is most excited about the two most recent electrified additions to his fleet: an electric scooter and an electric snowmobile. The snowmobile logged 300 miles this winter as the primary grooming machine for the Roberts Farm Preserve cross-country ski trails. “Trust me, this thing’s got a lot more pep than the gas ones,” he said with a boyish grin. He’s been showing it off to some local downhill ski mountains in the hope that they’ll make the switch for a zippier, quieter, more cost-effective experience maintaining the slopes.

Sun Dog Solar, Belfast, Workhorse W4CC

Sun Dog Solar, one of the foremost solar installers in Midcoast and Central Maine, recently got two fully electric Class 4 work trucks through an Efficiency Maine program to encourage commercial adoption of medium- and heavy-duty EVs. Their 150-mile range will check all the boxes for local work within the Belfast service region, and the trucks will return home to charge each evening after a day of work. The Sun Dog team recently installed two fast chargers at their new office space, which is going to make their charging quick and easy while also offering charging access to the general public. Their fast chargers are backed up by a battery bank, so solar power can charge the batteries throughout the day, which then provide juice for the fast chargers. This helps them take full advantage of solar power while avoiding demand charges from the on-site fast chargers.

For a closer look at how rural Mainers are using their EVs, check out our visit to John and Erma Evans in Dexter.

Seal, Otisfield, Nissan Ariya

Seal’s 5th EV has been a major hit for her and her family, with over 300 miles of range and all-wheel drive for great handling in winter conditions. She got over range anxiety after her first EV, and now she and her family rely on two fully electric vehicles for all their travel needs.

Annette, South Portland, Hyundai Ioniq 5

Annette was cooking hot dogs with an electric grill plugged into her EV as she kindly sat to chat with interested folks passing by. She was first inspired to look into EVs when her local rec center installed EV chargers a few years ago. When she learned about the federal tax credit for EVs, her Ioniq 5 purchase was a no brainer, made all the easier by the recent installation of EV chargers at her apartment building in South Portland. Now, at age 90, Annette can easily charge at home and zip around where she needs to, trading off at the free charger with fellow EV drivers that live in her building.

Matt and Wesley, Bowdoinham, Mercedes EQS

Matt has been driving an EV for 12 years and is leasing his most recent edition in order to qualify for the federal tax credit. Matt’s 15-year-old son Wesley is logging all his driving hours on his learning permit in the Mercedes and loving every minute. With more than 500 miles of range, their EV takes the two of them to archery tournaments in Connecticut and back without a single charging stop. Their rooftop solar array at home allows them to charge both of their family EVs nearly for free.

Versant Power, Penobscot, Aroostook, Washington Counties, Chevy Silverado

Versant Power now has a dozen fully electric Chevy Silverado work trucks to access their large service area in eastern and northern Maine. Each truck boasts 440-480 miles of all-electric range, providing plenty of power to get to Versant ratepayers and power lines in rural areas during storms, power outages, and long workdays.

More about EVs

Pollution from gas-powered cars and trucks makes our air less safe to breathe and fuels climate change, so it’s important that Maine transition to cleaner, healthier ways to get around. NRCM is working with partners across the state to advance healthier, more affordable transportation choices, from electric cars and trucks to more reliable transit and safer walking and biking paths.

Sales of electric cars are booming. July through September 2025 saw several U.S. EV sales records smashed, with full-battery EVs reaching 10% of new vehicle sales for the first time ever. This recent success is in part due to a rush prior to the expiration of federal tax credits for EV purchases on September 30th.

Unfortunately, the efforts by the Trump Administration and their allies in Congress to kill tax credits for clean energy solutions will make it harder for Mainers to choose what is right for them. Worse, the EPA under the Trump administration is planning on repealing tailpipe pollution standards, which, according to their own proposal, will increase gas prices. For those Mainers looking to go electric, Efficiency Maine will still continue providing some incentives. Visit their website to learn more.

Here at NRCM we won’t stop fighting for a brighter future for everyone in our rural state, so they have healthier, more reliable and affordable ways to get around.

Environmental review will draw on archived FRA Tier 1 materials for the Chicago–Detroit–Pontiac corridor to update alignments and ridership forecasts.","A three-party memorandum of understanding signed Oct. 15 commits $40 million to engineering and environmental work for a new multimodal transit hub that could re-establish passenger rail service at Detroit’s Michigan Central campus by the end of the decade.

The agreement, announced jointly by the Michigan Dept. of Transportation, the City of Detroit and Michigan Central, combines $10 million in federal RAISE funding — short for Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity — with $30 million in state contributions to launch preliminary design and environmental review.

According to documents examined by ENR, the federal award was issued earlier this year and remains active—with no indication of rescission—though RAISE grants are subject to obligation deadlines that determine when funds are formally committed.

Officials said the planning phase will define the project’s scope, delivery approach and schedule before any construction moves forward.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) said the plan “lays the foundation for a new multimodal transportation hub that will grow our regional economy,” calling it a critical investment in both “mobility and opportunity.”

A Symbolic Return

Completed in 1913 and once one of the nation’s most prominent rail terminals, Michigan Central Station closed to passengers in 1988 and sat vacant for decades before Ford Motor Co. acquired the property in 2018.

Following a $740 million restoration, Ford reopened the Beaux-Arts landmark in 2024 as the centerpiece of its Corktown mobility innovation campus.

The new MOU extends that revitalization beyond architecture. If realized, it would return Amtrak and intercity bus operations to the site for the first time in nearly 40 years. A new facility at Michigan Central would likely replace Detroit’s aging Amtrak station in the city’s New Center neighborhood.

City infrastructure chief Sam Krassenstein said residents “deserve a first-class facility for bus and train service, and this agreement puts us on a path to make it happen.”

Project partners said the funding covers engineering and environmental review and will help define ownership structure and delivery model. MDOT plans to coordinate with Amtrak and the Federal Railroad Administration to assess the feasibility of restoring intercity service.

Beth Kmetz-Armitage, Michigan Central’s director of commercial development, said the initiative is about “strengthening regional connections — both immediately regional in Ann Arbor and broadly Midwestern all the way to Chicago.”

112-year-old Train Depot Finds New Glory in Renovation

While no final alignment has been set, MDOT officials said the plan could eventually extend Amtrak’s Wolverine line from Chicago through Windsor, Ontario, to connect with VIA Rail service to Toronto. Amtrak has indicated such a cross-border link could be achieved with minimal new capital investment, pending regulatory and customs agreements.

Kmetz-Armitage said in a press conference that an existing rail line already connects Toronto to Chicago under the Detroit River, but is currently used only for freight traffic.

Plans call for a new multimodal transit hub west of the station, on Ford-owned land, where passengers could board beginning in 2028. According to Michigan Central, early projections estimate about 66,000 annual riders once the hub is operational.

The restored station itself would not serve as a boarding point; instead, travelers to and from Canada would pass through customs and border control in Windsor, Ontario. She said the planned facility would also improve westbound connections along Amtrak’s Wolverine corridor toward Chicago.

The MOU sets 2026 for completion of environmental studies and 2028 for final design and procurement, with operations targeted before 2030.

Technical and Financial Context

MDOT’s 2023 Corridor Identification and Development submission to the Federal Railroad Administration describes the Detroit–Pontiac–Chicago corridor as a 304-mile route spanning Amtrak, Norfolk Southern, Canadian National and Conrail ownership.

The corridor has received multiple federal grants since 2010 for signaling, track upgrades and speed improvements; the Wolverine’s on-time performance averaged just 62% in fiscal 2022, according to MDOT’s application citing Amtrak’s status report.

The department manages about $100 million annually from the state’s Comprehensive Transportation Fund for passenger and freight programs. The Detroit hub would likely replace and consolidate the Howard Street intercity bus terminal downtown and the aging Amtrak station in the city’s New Center neighborhood.

Krassenstein said the plan builds on the station’s historical role as Detroit’s “gateway,” adding that re-establishing rail service “in the shadow of the station” revives a core part of the city’s infrastructure identity.

Ford to Purchase Old Detroit Train Station

No contractor or joint venture has been named for the effort, and no procurement has been issued. MDOT and city officials said design and contracting decisions will follow completion of the environmental and preliminary engineering phases.

Bradley C. Wieferich, Michigan’s state transportation director, said the partnership “is a positive step to further develop Michigan Central into a true transportation hub and innovation ecosystem,” but added that additional federal coordination will be required before procurement.

While Detroit-based Christman–Brinker managed Ford’s restoration of Michigan Central Station, that joint venture has not been linked to the new rail hub. Public procurement records reviewed Oct. 16 show no active RFQ or RFP through the state’s SIGMA VSS or the city’s BidNet Direct portals.

Hurdles Remain

The project faces complex integration issues requiring coordination with freight operators for access tracks and platform space, as well as a review of regulatory and customs requirements under the 2019 U.S.–Canada Land, Rail, Marine and Air Transport Preclearance Agreement.

Environmental review will draw on archived FRA Tier 1 materials for the Chicago–Detroit–Pontiac corridor to update alignments and ridership forecasts.

Regional research by the Southeast Michigan Council of Governments on the Ann Arbor–Detroit commuter rail corridor will inform how the hub interfaces with local transit and Detroit Metropolitan Airport.

Michigan Central CEO Josh Sirefman said the project “brings together our legacy infrastructure and our future mobility,” adding that the hub aims to link “innovation, community access and cross-border connectivity.”

Whether those ambitions materialize, he said, will depend on aligning funding sources and “translating years of vision into engineered access and buildable design.”",https://www.enr.com/ext/resources/2025/10/16/Michigan-Centrail-Rail-Station.jpg?height=635&t=1760624685&width=1200,N,,2025-10-16 15:08:49.018412

The Biden administration’s former top energy adviser Amos Hochstein warned on Thursday that AI’s energy demand is at risk of outstripping supply.

“We have a huge gap on energy and AI,” Hochstein, who is a managing partner at TWG Global, said at Semafor’s World Economy Summit in Washington, DC.

“If things don’t happen soon, it will become a crisis. I’m not an alarmist in general, but I don’t think we are going in the right direction,” Hochstein said. TWG Global is heavily investing in the AI industry. Earlier this year, it announced a partnership with Palantir and xAI to develop AI for financial services and insurance sectors.

Tech companies are jockeying for energy to power data centers to run their AI models. As these companies look to expand their data center footprint, their capacity requirements have raised questions over whether existing power generation will be enough. And in communities where new data centers are being built, some residents have claimed the capacity is raising their energy bills, with some fighting against new projects.

Opposition to new data centers has also become an issue in some local elections. Candidates from both parties in a Virginia county board of supervisors election are campaigning to ban new data center construction, Semafor reported this week.

An IEA report from April projected that electricity demand from data centers worldwide is set to more than double by 2030 to slightly above the electricity consumption of all of Japan today, with AI driving a majority of the increase. In the US, the IEA estimated that data center power consumption will account for almost half of the growth in electricity demand between now and 2030.

Know More

Hochstein emphasized that AI’s energy requirements could threaten growth.

American AI companies are working incredibly fast and are armed with unprecedented amounts of capital. At the same time, they are competing both with each other and China to build the best technologies, he said. Meanwhile, utility and power companies, and the officials overseeing such projects, operate much more slowly.

“The culture clash is significant,” Hochstein said.

AI companies “used to talk about [doing] a gigawatt cluster. Now, we’re talking about five gigawatt clusters,” Hochstein said, adding that is only set to increase.

“We don’t have that power. We don’t have that supply chain of materials and turbines and masters and electricians.”

“AI companies are finally coming to the fact that, ‘OK, I’m really smart at technology and AI. I may not know energy,’” Hochstein said.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/pcqAWjv.4TTCsXa3Y64spA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/semafor_310/dbfb82198b8e6edde9dd2f635bd4dc84,N,,2025-10-16 15:09:28.613953

By Victoria Heath

Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. Newton’s phrase could not be more fitting to describe America’s oscillating stance on climate policy. As Trump withdraws the US from major clean energy commitments – such as the Paris Agreement – look in another direction and you’ll find projects in the nation toiling away to construct offshore wind farms, like those in New York, or solar-storage projects in California.

As the game of tug of war continues, public bodies and experts alike have shared their concerns over such a turbulent environment. The US Chamber of Commerce has expressed in no uncertain terms its dissatisfaction with ‘the [Trump] administration’s contradictory approach to energy policy’, while a paper published in The Lancet describes the US’s climate policy as ‘erratic’. It’s clear to see: the road ahead to the future of the US’s energy is one paved with uncertainty.

While Trump continues to rescind funding from climate projects, it may seem inevitable that the US is heading towards a future comprised of fossil fuels and incessant cries of the infamous ‘drill, baby, drill’ mantra. Yet, in reality, the situation is far more complex, with the US continuing to toe the line between clean energy leadership and carbon-heavy dependency.

Clean(er) energy

Despite mounting rollbacks on climate policies under the Trump administration, the clean energy sector is still booming in the US. Accounting for around 15 per cent of global clean energy investment, the US announced or advanced 523 new clean energy projects between August 2022 and February 2024. And in 2023 alone, the industry added 142,000 jobs – a 4.2 per cent increase that was more than double the growth rate of the overall US economy.

Such a trend continued into 2024, where clean energy employment growth was around three times faster than overall US job growth. Since 2020, clean energy and clean vehicle sectors have collectively added more than half a million jobs to the US economy, expanding the total workforce to around 3.56 million people.

The shares of renewables are also notable – in 2024, renewables accounted for more than 90 per cent of all new US electrical generating capacity. Solar alone contributed to 81 per cent of that new capacity. Planned additional construction projects in 2025 are still strongly skewed toward renewables – especially solar and battery, which are projected to make up 81 per cent of new capacity.

For the first time ever, in certain months in 2024, electricity from solar and wind outpaced that from coal. In 2024, solar and wind together produced more electricity than coal.

Carbon-free energy sources that are able to operate 24/7, such as geothermal and nuclear, are also garnering attention in the nation. For example, in 2024, Microsoft signed a 20-year power purchase agreement with Constellation for nuclear energy; Amazon said it would invest $500 million in small modular nuclear reactors, and Google announced plans to purchase power from small modular reactors. Clearly, big players on the global stage are staking a vested interest in renewable energy sources, offering hope for a decarbonised future.

In terms of clean energy manufacturing, certain US states are coming out on top. In 2024, 12 states generated more than 30 per cent of their electricity from wind, solar and geothermal energy. Iowa, South Dakota and Kansas each produced more than 50 per cent of their electricity from wind alone.

Texas has also made significant inroads into renewable energy. In recent years, the state has installed large quantities of solar, wind and battery capacity – far more than any other state. Since 2014, it has seen its solar output grow more than 70-fold, and battery capacity increase by nearly 95-fold.

One reason to explain such an uptick is Texas’s location, with its excellent wind corridors and high solar insolation. With a relatively low population density in rural areas, Texas has more opportunities to begin large-scale generation projects compared to more urban-centric regions.

However, such large-scale projects, like those in Texas, have been threatened by funding cuts, regulatory rollbacks or cancelled permits under the Trump administration. As part of a broader rollback, the US Department of Energy cancelled more than $1 billion of clean energy project funding in Texas. Among the affected grants was a $331.9 million grant to replace natural gas with hydrogen, as well as a $270 million grant for a carbon-capture facility.

In total, funding for four of Texas’s six industrial decarbonisation projects has reportedly been rescinded. Such cuts represent just a small percentage of the total affected clean energy projects in the US. In total, estimates say around 35 privately-driven projects (such as solar farms, clean-tech manufacturing plants or battery gigafactories) have either been ‘closed, cancelled or downsized’ since Trump’s second term began.

The Republican administration also announced the cancellation of $7.6 billion in grants supporting 223 clean energy projects, ranging from hydrogen hubs, grid modernisation, solar access and industrial decarbonisation.

Rollbacks, cuts and ‘drill, baby, drill’

For Trump, a president who has claimed climate change is a ‘scam‘, a ‘hoax’ and the ‘greatest con job ever perpetrated’, tapping into the oil and gas industry seems both an agreeable and profitable decision.

Ten months on from his inauguration, Trump is still vocal about his interest in fossil fuels. Earlier this year, at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum, Trump emphasised that fossil fuels remain central to his administration’s economic and energy framework.

While promoting clean energy in some sectors, under Trump, the US government is continuing or expanding subsidies or tax incentives benefiting the fossil fuel industry (for example, in carbon capture or relaxed royalty rates). In 2025, the US was the world’s largest oil producer. As well as this, Trump’s legislative package, titled ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’, is reported to include nearly $40 billion in new federal subsidies for fossil fuels in 2025.

On Trump’s first day in office, an executive order was signed titled ‘Unleashing American Energy’, a plan aimed to remove regulatory barriers to oil, gas and coal production. He also declared a national energy emergency, used to justify the fast-tracking of permits for oil, gas and coal projects and the loosening of climate rules viewed as obstacles. Such rules included many Biden or Obama-era climate policies and emissions regulations. For example, the administration has plans to repeal greenhouse gas limits on coal and natural gas power plants.

In addition, the US continues to invest in liquified natural gas projects, pipelines and gas infrastructure to serve global markets. In 2024, fossil fuel supply investments remained a significant share of energy investment in the US.

Another mantra purported by Trump is his infamous ‘drill, baby, drill’ slogan, intended to signal a recommitment to fossil fuels and a promise to remove constraints on exploration, mining and infrastructure development. However, despite Trump’s rhetoric, active drilling has not increased accordingly. In fact, some reports show a drop in oil and gas rigs since Trump came into power. Some argue that producers are hesitant to ramp up drilling due to fears over uncertain returns, infrastructure constraints and market dynamics.

In reality, the limits of geology, pipelines and environmental opposition mean that not every oil and gas expansion plan can go ahead.

So, what is the future?

Ultimately, the US is home to a coexistence of both clean and fossil investments. Energy systems are large-scale, long-lived projects – it’s difficult for policymakers and regulators to make the switch to clean energy overnight. Some fossil fuel investments are ‘locked in’ by existing contracts, supply chains and infrastructure, making it more difficult to navigate out of them.

Renewables, despite their prevalence, are only usable when the sun shines, or when the wind blows. Until battery storage can cover multi-day or seasonal gaps, fossil fuels and natural gas must remain to stabilise electricity supplies.

During the transition period, it’s likely that fossil fuels will continue to underpin renewables, especially since the US has spent more than a century building pipelines, refineries and power plants worth trillions of dollars – a network that the nation doesn’t necessarily want to give up just yet.

Ironically, the clean energy industry also depends on fossil fuels. Manufacturing solar panels, wind turbines, and batteries still requires fossil-fuel-derived energy and petrochemical-based materials. Cargo ships, trucks and mining equipment that deliver vital rare earth metals for batteries often run on diesel.

Running away from fossil fuels would also spell disaster for the millions of Americans who rely on the industry for jobs, revenue and community income. As such, transition policies can offer an agreeable medium.

In short, the US’s energy landscape is a complex one, made all the more difficult by climate policies that are constantly in flux. It remains a challenge to predict the future of one of the world’s biggest energy producers, particularly against the backdrop of continual political turbulence.",https://geographical.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_2664435991.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 17:08:48.478444

Slate gave Design News a close-up look at a preproduction prototype so we could get an idea of what the final product will be like. The vehicle’s proportions are familiar to any of us who saw Toyota pickup trucks on the road a couple of decades ago, because the Slate pickup is exactly the same length, 174.6 inches, as the fifth-generation Toyota pickup that was in production from 1988 through 1994.

These trucks’ ubiquity was epitomized by the appearance of one as a delivery vehicle for Pizza Planet in the original Toy Story film. While the appeal of a two-seat compact pickup truck to contemporary drivers is an open question, it seems certain that companies with delivery fleets such as auto parts stores and pizza joints will value an inexpensive, bare-bones machine with low operating costs.

You might recall Dominos Pizza’s 2015 program to build its own low-cost vehicles based on the Chevrolet Spark, which was followed by the company’s 2022 adoption of Chevrolet Bolt EVs for its delivery fleet. This demonstrates the interest of such companies in having affordable, low-cost-per-mile delivery vehicles.

Here, Attorney General Neronha joins the attorneys general in Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawai’i, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, and the District of Columbia.","Attorney General Neronha will today join a coalition representing 22 states and the District of Columbia in suing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin for illegally ending a $7 billion program that lowers energy costs and pollution by bringing solar energy to more than 900,000 households in low-income and disadvantaged communities across the country. This action follows a separate suit filed yesterday by the coalition in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims to recover damages for EPA’s unlawful breach of the grant agreements that were executed under this program.

“It’s clear, here and in our nearly 40 other lawsuits, that the federal government is working against, not for, the American people,” said Attorney General Neronha. “Through each of their unlawful actions, the President and his Administration have consistently demonstrated their intent to cause chaos and disruption. Here, once again, the Administration has unlawfully clawed back congressionally allocated funds from the states. These funds were already being put to good use, creating clean energy, jobs, and savings for Americans. As with Revolution Wind, this latest attack on clean energy would harm Rhode Islanders and Americans for generations to come, and we won’t sit by while it happens.”

The United States Congress created the Solar for All program in 2022 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, directing EPA to make competitive grants to states and other entities to deploy solar projects in low-income and disadvantaged areas. EPA selected recipients and awarded all of the program funds to plaintiff states and other grant recipients by August 2024. Rhode Island and the other plaintiffs moved forward with planning projects and working with stakeholders to develop their solar programs.

But EPA abruptly and unlawfully terminated the program two months ago and clawed back the vast majority of the money already awarded, leaving the plaintiffs without access to the funds to proceed with their solar programs. In Rhode Island, the Office of Energy Resources (OER) applied for Solar for All funding and was awarded $49,330,000 in July 2024. Planning for this funding, OER proposed the launch and expansion of six financial-assistance programs and 12 project-deployment technical-assistance initiatives designed to equitably address barriers to solar adoption in Rhode Island’s low-income and disadvantaged communities. Between the various programs OER intended to offer using the funding, the Office expected to serve approximately 5,225 low-income households, reducing their electrical bills by $48,477,353. Additionally, Solar for All would have directly resulted in 27.49 MW of energy and at least 100 new green jobs.

When President Trump took office in January, he prioritized fossil fuel extraction to address an alleged “energy emergency” while arbitrarily excluding solar power as a resource that can be tapped to meet the country’s energy needs. In July, Congress passed the president’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” rescinding funds for the Solar for All program that were unobligated as of July 3. The effect of that move was small, given that EPA had obligated all of the $7 billion for the program nearly a year earlier.

But instead of following that newly passed law, EPA and Zeldin illegally terminated the program on August 7. On social media, Zeldin made baseless accusations, calling Solar for All a “boondoggle.” The agency then sent memos to all recipients, including the plaintiffs, saying EPA no longer has a “statutory basis or dedicated funding” for the program, even though Congress never directed EPA to cancel funds that had already been awarded. In fact, Congress did the opposite by only rescinding unobligated funds for Solar for All.

Attorney General Neronha and a multistate coalition are filing a lawsuit today in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, alleging, among other things, that the EPA violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the U.S. Constitution’s Separation of Powers Doctrine in unlawfully canceling the program.

Attorney General Neronha will join the attorneys general of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawai’i, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, and the District of Columbia in filing this lawsuit. Also joining the complaint are the governors of Kentucky and Pennsylvania, as well as the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation.

Separately, Rhode Island joined a lawsuit that was filed yesterday in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. In that complaint, the states and other entities argue the EPA breached the clear terms of the agreements and violated the duty of good faith and fair dealing in canceling their Solar for All grants. They are asking the court to award the plaintiffs money damages, interest, and fees.

The partnership reflects the increasing energy requirements of AI computing and the data centres that support it. As large-scale AI models continue to expand, maintaining stable and clean power becomes a critical operational challenge for cloud providers.

Stable power for intensive AI workloads

AI applications place unique pressure on data centre energy systems. Power usage fluctuates depending on model size and computational intensity, leading to inconsistent loads that affect efficiency and grid performance.

“AI workloads are uniquely power-intensive and highly variable, often creating swings in demand,” says Mahesh Thiagarajan, Executive Vice President of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. “By collaborating with VoltaGrid, we’re engineering innovations that dampen these swings, making AI’s power usage more stable, predictable and grid-friendly.

“VoltaGrid’s platform joins OCI’s broad energy portfolio to bolster our leading-edge AI infrastructure with dependable power that can be effortlessly scaled.”

VoltaGrid’s modular infrastructure enables Oracle to stabilise energy supply across its expanding AI footprint. The system integrates with OCI’s energy strategy to ensure continuous, on-demand power delivery while maintaining compliance with emissions standards.

The company highlights key advantages of its approach, including AI-optimised performance, high-quality power output, vertical integration for deployment speed and a design that enhances heat rejection efficiency. These features aim to address the operational and environmental pressures linked with scaling modern AI data centres.

Expanding access to clean, reliable energy

Energy Transfer, a major US energy infrastructure provider, plays a central role in the partnership. Its pipeline and storage network delivers firm natural gas supply to VoltaGrid’s new facilities, providing a dependable source of fuel for sustained operations.

This access to stable gas supply demonstrates the commercial value of Energy Transfer’s infrastructure in supporting enterprise-scale energy requirements. It also reflects the growing importance of hybrid energy solutions that balance renewable integration with reliable gas-based supply for consistent uptime.

The collaboration allows Oracle to reinforce the resilience of its AI infrastructure without relying exclusively on grid resources. In doing so, it strengthens data centre reliability across regions with increasing electricity demand caused by AI and high-performance computing growth.

Job creation and regional investment in Texas

VoltaGrid’s initiative extends beyond power delivery to include long-term investment in Texas-based manufacturing and operations. The company and its supply chain partners plan to expand production capacity across the Dallas and Houston regions, creating over 400 new manufacturing jobs.

In addition, operational growth will generate more than 350 new roles in Texas. These positions will support the ongoing expansion of VoltaGrid’s infrastructure, reinforcing local economic development while building a skilled energy and engineering workforce.

Through this collaboration, VoltaGrid aligns sustainable power technology with enterprise cloud infrastructure demands. By combining natural gas efficiency, low emissions design and responsive power systems, the partnership with Oracle aims to set a benchmark for how AI data centres manage rising energy consumption without compromising reliability or sustainability.

“We are not negotiating veto by veto. We defend this solution that maintains the integrity of the vetoes, to avoid litigation,” João Paulo Capobianco, executive secretary of the Environment Ministry, told Valor.

In recent days, especially on Wednesday, Chief of Staff Rui Costa, Institutional Relations Minister Gleisi Hoffmann, and Environment Minister Marina Silva have stepped in to try to contain the veto override movement launched by lawmakers primarily linked to the agribusiness and infrastructure sectors. A manifesto signed by 89 business associations and released last Tuesday called for the full repeal of the vetoes.

Mr. Capobianco explains that the Executive branch’s request to postpone the congressional session, initially scheduled for this Thursday, was to avoid a “hasty vote.” “The government has formed a task force, and we are talking to several lawmakers,” he adds.

In July, Congress approved a bill, dubbed the “Devastation Bill,” which received harsh criticism from environmentalists and even from within the government, such as from the Ministry of the Environment. In response, President Lula vetoed several of the bill’s provisions in August and also sent a provisional presidential decree and a bill with constitutional urgency to Congress to replace the vetoed provisions.

For Mr. Capobianco, the bill approved three months ago posed “extremely grave risks to the environmental legislation,” which the government is now seeking to address by coordinating efforts to prevent the vetoes from being repealed. The government understands that it is necessary to maintain not only the vetoes, but also the decree and the bill it sent to Congress.

The decree creates the Special Environmental Permit (LAE)—championed by Mr. Alcolumbre—which aims to expedite strategic projects with government approval, establishing a maximum licensing deadline of one year. The idea is that the new procedures can accelerate the licensing of large projects, such as oil exploration in the mouth of the Amazon River, in the Equatorial Margin—which covers the coast of Amapá, the Senate president’s home state.

The bill, which had constitutional procedural urgency (45 days to be approved in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, but this deadline has since been waived), amended controversial details approved by lawmakers, such as the License by Adhesion and Commitment (LAC), which established self-declared licensing procedures. Congress wanted it to be authorized for projects with medium environmental impact, but the government proposed that it be authorized only for low-impact projects.

For instance, one respondent wrote: “Nuclear power plants tend to set radiation off and it destroys our environment.” A look at U.S. nuclear power reactors The U.S. currently has 94 nuclear power reactors, including one that opened in Georgia last year.","About six-in-ten U.S. adults now say they favor more nuclear power plants to generate electricity, according to a Pew Research Center survey fielded in April and May. That’s up from 43% in 2020, driven by increasing support among both Republicans and Democrats.

The Trump administration and Democrats and Republicans in Congress support expanding nuclear power. The second Trump administration has issued four executive orders aimed at dramatically increasing the United States’s nuclear capacity. And a major law President Donald Trump signed in July 2025 preserved many tax incentives for nuclear power.

Americans remain more likely to favor expanding solar (77%) and wind power (68%) than nuclear power (59%). But while support for solar and wind power has declined by double digits since 2020 – largely driven by drops in Republican support – the share who favor nuclear power has grown by 16 percentage points since then.

How we did this

To measure public attitudes toward the use of nuclear power in the United States, we analyzed our prior data from Pew Research Center surveys. Most of the data comes from a survey of 5,085 U.S. adults conducted April 28-May 4, 2025.

Everyone who took part in the survey is a member of the Center’s American Trends Panel (ATP), a group of people recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses who have agreed to take surveys regularly. This kind of recruitment gives nearly all U.S. adults a chance of selection. Interviews were conducted either online or by telephone with a live interviewer. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP’s methodology.

Here are the survey questions used for this analysis, the topline and the survey methodology.

In addition, we tracked the number of U.S. nuclear power reactors over time by analyzing data from the International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA) Power Reactor Information System. The IAEA classifies a reactor as “operational” from the date of its first electrical grid connection to the date of its permanent shutdown. Reactors that face temporary outages are still categorized as operational. Annual totals exclude reactors that closed that year.

Views by gender

Attitudes on nuclear power production have long differed by gender.

In our April-May survey, men remain far more likely than women to favor expanding nuclear power plants to generate electricity in the U.S. (74% vs. 44%). This pattern holds among adults in both political parties.

Views on nuclear energy differ by gender globally, too, according to a Center survey conducted from fall 2019 to spring 2020. In 18 of the 20 places surveyed, men were more likely than women to favor using more nuclear power as a source of domestic energy.

Views by party

Republicans are more likely than Democrats to favor expanding nuclear power to generate electricity in the U.S. Roughly seven-in-ten Republicans and Republican-leaning independents (69%) say they favor this, compared with about half of Democrats and Democratic leaners (52%).

Republicans have supported nuclear power in greater shares than Democrats each time we’ve asked this question since 2016.

The partisan gap in support for nuclear power (17 percentage points) is smaller than those for other types of energy, including fossil fuel sources such as offshore oil and gas drilling (52-point gap) and coal mining (50 points).

Americans in both parties see nuclear power more positively now than they did earlier this decade. The share of Democrats who favor expanding it is up 15 points since 2020, and Republican support has grown by 16 points.

While younger Republicans tend to be more supportive of increasing domestic renewable energy sources than their older peers, the pattern reverses for nuclear energy. For example, Republicans under 30 are more likely than those ages 65 and older to favor more solar panel farms (69% vs. 53%). But they are 14 points less likely than the oldest Republicans to support expanding nuclear power (61% vs. 75%).

Why Americans favor or oppose expanding nuclear power in their own words

We also asked Americans to share the main reason they favor or oppose more nuclear power in their own words.

Among those who favor more nuclear power, the most common reason why is that it is a clean or low-carbon way of producing energy (40%). As two respondents wrote:

“[Nuclear power plants] are currently the only carbon-free form of power generation capable of producing large amounts of power efficiently, and without the downside of being dependent on weather conditions.”

“They are a clean source of energy that can produce a massive amount of energy for the amount of money and time invested in them.”

Some of those who favor more nuclear power also say this because it is efficient (20%) or safe (13%):

“We’ve learned to maintain safety with nuclear power. (Think of military usages such as submarines and aircraft carriers.) It’s clean and waste can be safely handled.”

Other reasons highlighted include economic benefits (13%), reliability (10%) and the need for more varied energy sources (9%) as reasons they support nuclear power.

Among those who oppose more nuclear power, safety concerns are the most common reason (44%). This includes respondents who say nuclear power is generally not safe, mention risks of catastrophe and risks to human health.

“If something were to go wrong, it could be catastrophic.”

“[Nuclear power plants] are dangerous, and I don’t trust humans to be responsible enough to take the necessary safety precautions.”

Other reasons for opposing nuclear power include general concerns about its environmental impact (14%) and specific concerns about toxic waste (14%). For instance, one respondent wrote:

“Nuclear power plants tend to set radiation off and it destroys our environment.”

A look at U.S. nuclear power reactors

The U.S. currently has 94 nuclear power reactors, including one that opened in Georgia last year. Reactors collectively generated 18.2% of all U.S. electricity that came from utility-scale facilities in 2024, according to preliminary data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

About half of the United States’s nuclear power reactors (48) are in the South, while nearly a quarter (22) are in the Midwest. There are 18 reactors in the Northeast and six in the West, according to data from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

The number of U.S. reactors has fallen since peaking at 111 in 1990. Nine Mile Point-1 – located in Scriba, New York – is the oldest U.S. nuclear power reactor still in operation. It first connected to the power grid in November 1969.

Most of the 94 current reactors began operations in the 1970s (41) or 1980s (44), IAEA data shows. (The IAEA classifies reactors as “operational” from their first electrical grid connection to their date of permanent shutdown.)

Within the last decade, eight reactors shut down, and just three new reactors joined the power fleet.

One of the many reasons nuclear power projects have dwindled in recent decades may be the perceived dangers following nuclear accidents in the U.S. and abroad. For example, the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi accident led the Japanese government and other countries to rethink their nuclear energy plans. High construction costs and radioactive waste storage are also often-cited hurdles to nuclear energy development.

Still, many advocates say that nuclear power is key to reducing emissions from electricity generation. Tech companies have also expressed recent interest in reviving decommissioned nuclear power sites, including Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island and Iowa’s Duane Arnold, to power large artificial intelligence-focused data centers. Michigan’s Palisades plant, which shuttered in 2022, could become the first recommissioned reactor this year.",https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2022/03/FT_22.03.15_NuclearPower_feature-jpg.webp?w=1200&h=628&crop=1,N,,2025-10-16 14:08:06.711633

Attorney General Mayes is spearheading both lawsuits after a long career of fighting for renewable energy and subsequent cost-savings for Arizona consumers.
While serving as a Republican Commissioner and Commission Chair on the Arizona Corporation Commission, Attorney General Mayes co-authored Arizona’s renewable energy standards.","PHOENIX — Attorney General Kris Mayes and several other plaintiffs are suing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin for illegally ending a $7 billion program that lowers energy costs and pollution by bringing solar energy to more than 900,000 households in low-income and disadvantaged communities across the country.

Arizona and other grant recipients also filed suit yesterday in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims to recover damages for EPA’s unlawful breach of grant agreements that were executed under this program.

“Beyond the fact that this energy infrastructure funding has already been appropriated to our state and is owed to Arizonans, protecting solar projects and lower electricity bills is personal to me,” said Attorney General Mayes. “Arizona families are already facing sky-high electricity bills, and I will not let the EPA wriggle out of its commitment to fund solar energy projects that would lower costs for more than 900,000 Arizona households.”

Congress created the Solar for All program in 2022 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, directing EPA to make competitive grants to states and other entities to deploy solar projects in low-income and disadvantaged areas. EPA selected recipients and, by August 2024, had awarded all of the program funds to the plaintiff states and other grant recipients. Arizona and the other plaintiffs moved forward with planning projects and working with stakeholders to develop their solar programs.

But EPA abruptly and unlawfully terminated the program two months ago and clawed back the vast majority of the money already awarded. That has left Arizona and the other plaintiffs without access to the funds to proceed with their solar programs, after the states spent significant time and resources planning and launching programs. . In 2024, EPA awarded the state of Arizona a nearly $156 million grant to establish its Solar for All Arizonans program, designed to add affordable and reliable distributed electricity generation to Arizona’s grid.

Had Arizona been able to implement its EPA-approved plans, the Solar for All Arizonan program would have brought substantial benefits to program participants and to the State, including creating $165 million in bill savings for participating households, thousands of new, good-paying jobs throughout Arizona’s solar industry and 61 megawatts of new solar deployment, all while preventing at least 96,000 tons of CO2 from entering Arizona’s atmosphere each year.

The Hopi Tribe, through its Hopi Utilities Corporation, also received a $25 million Solar for All grant to install solar panels and battery storage in homes across the Hopi Reservation in Northeastern Arizona.The Solar for All program would have improved energy access for nearly 600 Hopi homes, many of which had never before had access to electricity.

When President Trump took office this past January, he prioritized fossil fuel extraction to address an alleged “energy emergency” while arbitrarily excluding solar power as a resource that can be tapped to meet the country’s energy needs. In July, Congress passed the president’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” rescinding funds for the Solar for All program that were unobligated as of July 3. The effect of that move was small, given that EPA had obligated all of the $7 billion for the program nearly a year earlier.

But instead of following that newly passed law, EPA and Zeldin illegally terminated the program on August 7. On social media, Zeldin made baseless accusations, calling Solar for All a “boondoggle.” The agency then sent memos to all recipients, including the plaintiffs, saying EPA no longer has a “statutory basis or dedicated funding” for the program, even though Congress never directed EPA to cancel funds that had already been awarded. In fact, Congress did the opposite by only rescinding unobligated funds for Solar for All.

Attorney General Mayes and several other plaintiffs are filing a lawsuit today in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, alleging, among other things, that the EPA violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the U.S. Constitution’s Separation of Powers Doctrine in unlawfully cancelling the program.

Attorney General Mayes and the attorneys general of Minnesota and Washington, are leading this complaint, which is being joined by the attorneys general of California, Colorado, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Hawaiʻi, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Vermont. Also joining the complaint are the governors of Kentucky and Pennsylvania, as well as the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation.

Separately, Arizona co-led a lawsuit that was filed yesterday in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. In that complaint, the states and other entities argue the EPA breached the clear terms of the agreements and violated the duty of good faith and fair dealing in canceling their Solar for All grants. They’re asking the court to award the plaintiffs money damages, interest, and fees.

Ed Markey is getting help from some old friends in the environmental movement as he looks to defend his seat from a new primary challenger.

Markey fended off a challenge from then-Rep. Joe Kennedy III in 2020 with the help of greens. They’re vowing to mobilize again now that Rep. Seth Moulton announced he’ll take on Markey, who has spent five decades in Congress.

Moulton, 46, is directly challenging Markey over his age, framing his campaign as one for generational change. Markey, 79, would be 86 at the end of his term if he wins reelection next year.

“I don’t think someone who’s been in Congress for half a century is the right person to meet this moment and win the future,” Moulton said in a video announcing his candidacy. “Sen. Markey’s a good man. But it’s time for a new generation of leadership, and that’s why I’m running for U.S. Senate.”

But beyond age, the environment will be prominent in the contest. Markey has for decades been among the Hill’s loudest voices on climate and other green issues.

Weeks before Moulton launched his bid, Markey scored a key endorsement from the League of Conservation Voters, an electoral juggernaut. The group and its affiliates spent $165 million in the 2024 electoral cycle.

“He’s someone who’s been leading on these issues and fighting for his whole career. It’s hard to name many folks who have done more for these issues than Sen. Markey,” Craig Auster, LCV’s vice president of political affairs, said in an interview.

“I think voters are going to see that and know that Sen. Markey is on the front lines fighting for them and the things that are important to them, including clean energy and climate,” Auster continued.

“We especially in this awful time need somebody like Sen. Markey who’s not afraid of a tough fight and who always keeps what’s important at the top of his agenda, fighting for his constituents and the environment.”

The Sunrise Movement wrote on X in response to Moulton’s launch video: “Sorry, but you are one of the ‘leaders’ refusing to stand up to Trump — and you’re trying to unseat one of the people in Congress who has done the most to fight back against Trump.”

Markey’s green history

Markey is perhaps known best for the “American Clean Energy and Security Act,” which would have instituted a nationwide cap-and-trade system for greenhouse gas emissions, when he was in the House. He co-wrote the bill with then-Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.). The legislation passed the House, but the Senate never passed its own version.

Later, Markey was the chief Senate sponsor of the Green New Deal, which he introduced in 2019 alongside Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). It seeks a rapid decarbonization of the U.S. economy, with universal health care and guarantees of jobs and housing.

He notched some key wins in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, including the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund; $3 billion in environmental block grants; and millions for air pollution censors, energy efficient glass, offshore wind and more.

Many of those programs, however, were later undone in the Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act this year or via clawbacks by the Trump administration.

Markey has tried to get ahead of the question of his age. In an interview with Boston ABC News affiliate WCVB last year in which he announced he’d run for reelection, he said, “It’s not your age, it’s the age of your ideas.

“And I’ve always been the youngest guy in the room, working on the Green New Deal, on climate change, to make sure that the funding is there for wind and solar, all electric vehicles,” he continued.

Moulton dings Dem leaders

Moulton is likely to campaign as a centrist alternative to Markey. His launch video extensively criticized Democratic leadership, saying that “real people across Massachusetts are being hurt by Democratic leaders refusing to do everything they can to win.”

Moulton challenged Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) for the position of speaker after the 2018 midterm elections, and ran in the 2020 presidential election. He’s emphasized bipartisanship and bucked Democrats on numerous occasions, including criticizing the party for its transgender rights positions following the 2024 elections.

Moulton also was an early supporter of the Green New Deal in the House. He mentioned a commitment to fighting climate change numerous times in his campaign launch.

“Let’s talk about our children and the future that will be left for them if we don’t protect our democracy and tackle climate change,” he said, later saying children “need us to get back on the offensive when it comes to banning assault weapons and fighting climate change” and boasting about the climate impact of high-speed rail legislation he’s proposed.

A recent University of New Hampshire poll found that 42 percent of voters think Markey deserves reelection, and 39 percent say he doesn’t.

Another poll, released by the conservative Fiscal Alliance Foundation, had Moulton ahead of Markey by a margin of 43 percent to 21 percent among all likely voters, but a smaller gap of 38 percent to 30 percent among Democrats.

Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) hasn’t ruled out running in the Senate primary.

Climate activists — particularly the youth-centric Sunrise Movement — were key to Markey’s vicory against Kennedy.

The group, which is the main backer of the Green New Deal, activated its chapters across Massachusetts in support of Markey, making hundreds of thousands of calls, hosting virtual and in-person events, promoting him extensively on social media, and more. The senator’s appearances throughout the campaign in a bomber jacket and red Nike sneakers endeared him to the young activists.

“Sunrise Movement helped Markey win the youth vote, win the internet, and define himself as the clear progressive choice in this race,” Varshini Prakash, Sunrise’s executive director at the time, said after Markey’s primary victory.

Markey called his win “a tribute to those young people and to their vision.”

It helped move Markey from a 14-percentage-point polling deficit in a Boston Globe/Suffolk University poll a year before the primary to an 11-percentage-point win over Kennedy.

By Kyle Stock

Americans bought 438,500 electric cars and trucks in the third quarter, as drivers raced to grab federal incentives before they expired Sept. 30.

Those transactions, the highest number in a single quarter, comprised 11% of all new car sales, eclipsing the previous high point of 8.7%, according to Cox Automotive, a services and technology company.

A crowd of more affordable cars next year could help maintain the momentum, but analysts expect EV transactions to dip in the months ahead without federal tax credits.

Stephanie Valdez Streaty, Cox Director of Industry Insights, said in a report EVs could account for one quarter of all new US car sales by 2030. That’s “well short of the 50% once envisioned, but certainly moving out of the ‘niche’ category.”

Source: Cox Automotive Inc.

The sales tally underscores a tricky dynamic for auto executives and clean-air advocates: Millions of Americans want EVs, but relatively high prices remain a speed bump to adoption.

Tesla still dominates the US market for EVs and managed a small sales gain in the recent quarter after months of skidding results. However, a crowd of rivals is closing the gap quickly, shrinking Tesla’s share of the EV pie to 41% from 80% four years ago.

General Motors, in particular, is gaining electric speed. The company captured 15% of EV sales in the quarter, led by its new Chevrolet Equinox, the third best-selling battery-powered machine. That’s up from 10% in the year-earlier period.

Source: Cox Automotive Inc.

Nearly half of US EV purchases in the first half of the year were made without any federal incentive, according to BloombergNEF. And there are now at least 11 EVs in the US with starting prices below that of the average car purchase. Chevrolet’s Equinox can be had for about $35,000, for example, and the brand just released a new version of its Bolt with a price tag of $29,000.

The road ahead for EVs, however, looks rocky, at least for a little while. Without federal credits, BloombergNEF forecasts 27% of the US market will be electric by 2030, down from the 48% share it estimated a year ago. In the current quarter, S&P Global expects EVs to comprise less than 7% of new car sales.

“The affordability issue is going to be exacerbated,” said Peter Nagle, an associate director at S&P. “It’s really going to be a sink or swim moment.”

The other way to buy a cheap EV

34%

The year-over-year uptick in used EV sales. Pre-owned electric cars and trucks in America are now almost as cheap as used gas-powered vehicles, on average, and are selling even faster, according to Cox Automotive.

Volvo’s strategy

“Volvo will be stronger if we electrify fast. But we need new plug-in hybrids — electric cars with a backup engine — as a bridge until charging is everywhere.”

Hakan Samuelsson

Chief executive officer, Volvo

Samuelsson also told Bloomberg that said his company will take a “huge step” next year in offering EVs with longer driving ranges and lower prices.

The company cited rising costs and the need for more time to finalize contracts as reasons for the delay, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions about the timeline were private. The pipeline operator has planned for years to expand the existing LNG import terminal at Lake Charles into an export plant.

Energy Transfer didn’t respond to requests for comment via phone and email.

US LNG developers are rushing to line up financing and start construction on projects before the next global supply wave potentially overtakes demand, with BloombergNEF predicting that a glut will emerge by 2027. Qatar is progressing with its own years-long LNG buildout and a massive pipeline expansion by Gazprom PJSC could begin funneling more Russian gas to China by 2031.

Earlier this month, Bloomberg News reported that Energy Transfer was nearing an agreement to sell LNG from Lake Charles to MidOcean Energy, a subsidiary of investment firm EIG Global Energy Partners.

Chevron Corp., China’s ENN Energy Holdings Ltd. and South Korea’s SK Gas Trading LLC are among the companies that have inked long-term deals to buy LNG from Lake Charles. The Louisiana project would have a total capacity of 16.5 million metric tons of per year.

GM, Vale Pause Battery Material Plans in Canada on EV Pullback Back to video

Article content

The automaker said this week it’s incurring $1.6 billion in charges tied to its pullback from electric vehicles. Realigning EV capacity will lead to non-cash impairment and other charges of $1.2 billion, the automaker said in a regulatory filing, while the rest of the costs relate to canceling contracts and settling commercial arrangements linked to EV investments.

One of the unintended consequences of this consumer trend is the effect on gas tax revenue.

Every gasoline and diesel sale in the U.S. includes a small added tax. This tax is used to fund state transportation budgets, highway maintenance, and infrastructure projects. As a result of more EVs on the road, the amount of revenue generated by the gas tax is decreasing. This has created interesting financial repercussions, and a variety of solutions are being adopted to help.

Using state-by-state fuel tax data from the Department of Energy and consumer EV trends from the Alternative Fuels Data Center, CheapInsurance.com analyzed the economic impact of the changing transportation landscape and what’s being done to remedy the situation.

Nationwide EV adoption trends

Millions of Americans are choosing to purchase electric vehicles over traditional gas ones. The reasons include reduced charging costs compared to gas, lower emissions, and tax incentives.

The Bureau of Transportation Statistics reported that, in 2024, there were 1.2 million electric vehicle sales and 1.6 million hybrid electric vehicle sales. This is up from 238,000 EV sales and 455,000 hybrid-electric sales in 2020. This upward trend is likely to continue.

New EV registrations by state

The rate at which EVs are being bought and put on the road differs by state. This is mainly influenced by government policies, cultural attitudes, and economic factors.

For example, California has recently tried to enact an EV mandate that requires a certain percentage of new vehicle sales to be fully electric. This plan was then adopted by 11 other states. Although later blocked by the Senate, this prompted many consumers to transition to EVs.

Culturally, many Americans across the country do not want EVs, which explains lower purchase numbers in some states. The Pew Research Center found that, in May 2025, only 18% of Republicans and Republican-leaning individuals were at least somewhat interested in purchasing one. This is compared to Democrats, with 48% somewhat or very interested. This data was collected via a survey of Americans conducted from April 28 to May 4, 2025. This suggests that “red states” will have lower numbers of EV registrations than “blue states.”

A look at gas tax revenue loss in key EV states

The states with the highest EV registration numbers per 100,000 residents have the most significant loss in gas tax revenue. The number of EV vehicles on the road compared to gasoline vehicles is still quite low, so impacts are not being strongly felt yet. However, many states are predicting substantial losses in their gas tax revenue over the next decade.

In California, for example, the Mineta Transportation Institute predicts that there will be a 64% loss in revenue from 2025 to 2040. In this study, researchers considered eight different scenarios, each with a different rate of how many EVs are purchased, how many people in the state drive, and how many personal vehicles get registered. Results used 2024 inflation-adjusted numbers.

Budget impacts on state transportation departments

Millions of dollars in losses will have a severe impact on state highway and transportation departments if left unaddressed. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 2024 data pulled from the National Association of State Budget Officers states that gas tax revenue accounts for 35.9% of state transportation department revenue nationwide.

Without this revenue, several impacts will be felt:

Deficits in highway and road maintenance

Slower completion of infrastructure projects

Less development and expansion

Higher vehicle maintenance costs for the general population

How states are responding and planning for the future

States are recognizing that action needs to be taken to secure transportation budgets. Pew Research Center reports that many states are suffering from budget gaps and are having difficulty completing projects like bridge repairs.

To tackle the issue of reduced gas tax revenue, many states have begun taking measures and implementing programs that will generate revenue from electric vehicles instead.

EV registration fees

The most significant way that governmental bodies have buoyed transportation department revenue is with EV registration fees. These fees are charged at the initial time of registration and on an annual basis.

In Texas, for example, EV owners must pay $400 for the first-time registration and $200 each year, according to the Department of Energy.

Road usage charges

Other states are opting for a road usage fee. In Hawai‘i, EV owners are given the option to pay an annual, per-mile usage fee instead of a large registration fee. This is currently set at $0.08/mile, up to $50/year.

Oregon offers a similar program, called OReGO. California is also experimenting with its own pilot program.

What changes are needed on the road ahead?

It’s clear that policy change is needed to address the compounding loss in gas tax revenue as a result of widespread EV adoption. The amount of revenue that will need to be replaced is unclear, however, especially with an anticipated decline in EV demand due to the federal tax incentives ending.

Regardless, state agencies and the federal government will need to prioritize alternative methods for generating revenue. This could be through registration fees, road usage programs, or other revenue-generating systems that are put into place. It’s likely that the EV marketplace will continue to grow and that more households will begin replacing their gas vehicles, so prompt change is needed in the coming years.

Dive Brief:

General Motors’ Audit Committee approved a $1.6 billion impairment charge on Oct. 7 as part of a strategic realignment of its electric vehicle manufacturing capacity owing to slower-than-expected demand, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.

The charges include $1.2 billion in non-cash impairments and $400 million in cash costs for contract cancellations and settlements related to the automaker’s previous EV investment strategy.

In addition to slower-than-expected EV demand, GM cited recent changes to government policies, a rollback of emissions regulations and the Sept. 30 elimination of the federal EV tax credit as factors contributing to the impairment charge.

Dive Insight:

GM’s significant impairment charge highlights the auto industry’s vulnerability to sudden regulatory and policy shifts administered by the Trump Administration, including the impact of new tariffs on steel, aluminum and other auto parts that prompted GM and other automakers to reevaluate their supply chains. Earlier this year, GM revised its 2025 earnings guidance, which reflects an anticipated $4 billion to $5 billion impact in 2025 from tariffs on imported automobiles and parts.

GM also stated in its SEC filing that the reassessment of its EV manufacturing capacity, which includes battery component manufacturing in the U.S., is ongoing and may result in future cash and non-cash charges that may impact its revenue and cash flows. However, any changes to GM’s EV capacity will not affect the current retail portfolio of Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac EVs currently in production. The automaker expects that these models will remain available to consumers.

GM unveiled its redesigned Chevrolet Bolt on Oct. 9, with an MSRP of under $30,000, which may boost its appeal. The Bolt and Equinox EVs are expected to account for a majority of the brand’s EV volume in 2026, the automaker said in the release.

Previously, GM made significant investments in EV development to comply with emissions and fuel economy regulations that were scheduled to become increasingly more stringent through 2032.

In January 2022, GM announced it would invest $7 billion across four Michigan plants to expand production of battery cells and electric trucks. However, because of current market conditions, the automaker has revised those plans and is making investments to support production of its highly profitable truck and SUV portfolio.

In May, GM announced plans to invest $888 million in its Tonawanda Propulsion plant in Buffalo, New York, to support production of a next-generation V8 gas engine for its full-size trucks and SUVs. The planned investment is GM’s largest-ever commitment in an engine manufacturing plant.

In June, GM also announced plans to invest roughly $4 billion in its U.S. assembly plants in three states over the next two years, to boost domestic output of both gas and electric vehicles.

Yaw. “State mandates and artificial price controls distort those markets, discourage investment and ultimately drive-up costs. PJM should remain focused on preserving the current structure and reject these misguided and short-sighted recommendations that undermine reliability and affordability.""

The letter, addressed to PJM President and CEO Manu Asthana, responds directly to the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators’ September 29th letter, which called for PJM to accelerate the connection of wind and solar projects.

[Editor’s Note: The September 29 letter was signed by 107 state lawmakers from the PJM region. Read more here.

[Utility Dive reported Jeffrey Shields, a PJM spokesman, said in an email that PJM has testified to Congress twice this year that it will need all available capacity, including renewable energy, to meet its resource adequacy needs. Read more here.

[The Solar Energy Industries Association reported Congressional Republican cuts to federal funding for renewable energy projects has resulted in blocking 125 gigawatts of solar power from getting to the grid. Read more here.

[The only fuel promoted by PA Republicans has been natural gas which is already used to fire 60% of the state’s electric generation capacity. Read more here.

[The overreliance on this one fuel, instead of a diverse generation fuel mix, is causing steadily increasing electricity prices. Read more here.]

Sen. Yaw and his colleagues warn that favoring these intermittent sources over proven baseload generation resources like natural gas, coal and nuclear would jeopardize grid stability and increase costs for ratepayers.

[Editor’s Note: Rep. Thomas Mehaffie (R-Dauphin) said at a May House hearing-- “[Natural] gas is not baseload power. Read more here.

[“Baseload power means that you have ample fuel supply for over three months [on site]. So coal and nuke are the only two that are baseload power on demand.

[“And I get there's plenty of gas out there, but that's all on demand. They can shut it off and turn it on as they want, but that fuel supply is not there for them,” said Rep. Mehaffie, [As we have seen in multiple severe winter weather events.] Read more here.]

[Locking Up Existing Electric Generation

[Editor’s Note: Not addressed in the Senators’ letter is the fact that multiple, existing gas, nuclear and hydroelectric plants in Pennsylvania are being locked up for the exclusive use of A.I. data centers and effectively taken off the grid. Read more here.

[Power from all five Pennsylvania’s nuclear power plants is being locked up for exclusive use by A.I. data centers: Three Mile Island (the project that started the data center “power stampede”), Beaver Valley, Peach Bottom, Susquehanna Station and Limerick.

[The July Pittsburgh A.I. Summit alone included announcements of multiple power plant deals for existing power plants and announcements of new power plants being developed exclusively for data centers, not “ordinary people” and the grid. Read more here.]

Human activities, mainly the burning of coal, oil and gas for energy, have been driving carbon dioxide concentrations higher and higher for more than half a century. This has warmed Earth rapidly, as carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases cause energy from the sun to remain trapped near the planet’s surface. Last year was Earth’s hottest year in recorded history.

Human-caused emissions remained the major driver of the record recent jump in carbon dioxide levels, the largest since modern measurements began in 1957, according to the organization, which is the weather and climate agency of the United Nations.

In 2024, the atmosphere’s average concentration of the gas reached 423.9 parts per million, an increase of 3.5 parts per million from the year before. That edged out a 3.3 parts per million increase in 2016 that was previously the largest ever measured. Year-to-year rises in carbon dioxide concentrations have accelerated since the 1960s, when the average pace of increase was 0.8 parts per million.

An uptick in emissions from wildfires was likely to have played a role in 2024’s record jump, as was decreased absorption of carbon dioxide by the land and the ocean, the agency said. Severe drought and forest fires can degrade the ability of soil and plants to draw down carbon dioxide from the atmosphere while rising ocean temperatures lessen seawater’s capacity to harbor the gas.

Carbon dioxide that is not absorbed by the land or by the seas can remain in the atmosphere for centuries, influencing the climate long after its original release into the skies.

The U.S. Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office said Thursday it has closed a $1.6 billion loan guarantee to a subsidiary of American Electric Power to reconductor and rebuild around 5,000 miles of transmission lines across Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, and West Virginia.

The conditional loan commitment was announced in January as part of $23 billion in assistance DOE offered to eight utilities for investments in transmission, energy storage, grid modernization and gas pipelines.

The Trump administration has been reviewing loan commitments and grants finalized in the waning days of the Biden administration, charging that many were rushed through with inadequate review. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the AEP loan will bolster reliability and “ensure lower electricity costs across the Midwestern region of the United States.”

Dive Insight:

DOE did not immediately respond to questions about the status of other loan guarantees announced in January. AEP is the first company to close a loan guarantee under the Energy Dominance Financing Program created by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. President Trump signed the legislation into law earlier this year.

The guarantee “was carefully evaluated” under new LPO guidance and “delivers on the Trump administration’s promise to responsibly steward taxpayer dollars and unleash American energy dominance,” DOE said in a statement.

AEP is “experiencing growth in energy demand that has not been seen in a generation,” President, CEO and Chairman Bill Fehrman said in a statement.

Customers have committed to 24 GW of electricity demand by the end of the decade, AEP said, and necessary upgrades have been identified to support data center, artificial intelligence and manufacturing development.

Approximately 100 miles of transmission line across Ohio and Oklahoma are the first projects supported by the loan guarantee, AEP said; additional funding and projects will follow.

“This loan saves our customers money and improves reliability while supporting economic growth in our states,” AEP said. “The funds we will save through this program enable us to make additional investments to enhance service for our customers.”

Electric utilities receiving an Energy Dominance Financing loan “must provide assurance to DOE that financial benefits from the financing will be passed on to the customers of that utility,” DOE said.

The loan guarantee, to AEP Transmission, will save customers “an estimated $275 million in financing costs over the life of the loan,” the company said. The company estimated about 1,100 construction jobs will be created through the projects.

“Seeking federal funding opportunities and implementing rate structures that ensure new large customers are supporting infrastructure investment are some of the ways AEP is working to reduce rate impacts for customers,” the company said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/nSSb2mX-b_TcZrFo234vB_X6Jnajdx3wt06w539wyXM/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy05MDY2MTk0MS5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-10-16 12:12:03.099159

Data centers in other parts of the country have already skyrocketed some Americans’ electric bills, as utilities must rapidly build more power plants and transmission lines to compensate for the soaring demand. The issue has come up as part of the complex rate case of Florida Power & Light, giving state utility regulators the chance to set guardrails that could set a precedent for Duke Energy Florida and Tampa Electric.

When Florida Power & Light first filed its request to hike base rates, it asked to collect nearly $10 billion more from customers over the next four years. Embedded in that petition was also how it proposed to address data centers: It would require tech companies to pay a minimum bill representing 90% of their expected energy costs. That way, if a data center’s consumption fell short, residents wouldn’t be required to cover the gap incurred by the utility building up its infrastructure to accommodate the facility.

But consumer advocates have fiercely fought the overall proposal, which is believed to be the largest rate hike request in American history. In response, Florida Power & Light, along with other parties in the case — many of them business interests, like a federation of retail companies, industrial corporations and Walmart — proposed a settlement deal that would lower the overall rate increase to around $7 billion. It would also reduce the minimum bill requirement for data centers to 70% of their expected energy costs.

The utility’s chief executive officer, Armando Pimentel, said during the hearings that having data centers come to Florida could benefit all customers, because costs would be spread out among more users.

“We wanted to provide something that was attractive enough to data centers ... so they would take a look at Florida,” he said, adding he didn’t think the change sacrificed customer protections.

James Wilson, an economist and business consultant specializing in data centers, testified Wednesday that the fact Florida Power & Light is proactively proposing data center tariffs is “really a good thing.”

But Wilson told regulators that the company should raise the minimum bill back to 90%, or at least 80%, to mirror what other utilities are doing nationwide. Wilson testified on behalf of the Legislature-appointed consumer advocate, the Office of the Public Counsel, which is opposed to the company’s proposed settlement. Two other groups representing residential customers are also against the deal, saying it caters to big business.

“I think the question you have to ask is, ‘Why?’” Wilson said. “‘Why would prospective data center customers be pushing for 70%?’”

He added that major tech companies like Google, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon work hard to maintain their public image and are unlikely to “push for shifting a lot of the cost and risk of what they’re doing to residential customers,” raising questions about which companies are participating in this case.

Supporting the deal is the Florida Energy for Innovation Association, which its lawyer, D. Bruce May, said represents companies that have signed confidential agreements with Florida Power & Light to explore building data centers in the state. He has not publicly disclosed the names of the companies.

May said that the group supports the 70% minimum bills, adding that they will still “ensure the integrity of our grid and protect the general body of ratepayers from having to subsidize data centers.”

Gov. Ron DeSantis, who appointed all of the utility regulators on the Florida Public Service Commission, recently opined about who should bear the costs of data centers’ resource needs.

“I’m on the side of protecting the hardworking people of this state,” DeSantis said at an event last month. “If someone wants to build a business or build something like that, they’ve got to do it on their own dime. It should not be subsidized by everybody else having to pay up the nose for the necessities of life.”

Lawyers and utility regulators have gathered for grueling, all-day hearings in the Florida Power & Light rate case for the past week and a half. The proceedings resemble a court trial, with company executives providing sworn testimony on the witness stand.

Those hearings are scheduled to end Friday, with regulators expected to make a final decision on the rate hikes around the end of the year.

The Trump administration has now finalized that loan in a rare example of continuity between the administrations on energy policy.
“The President has been clear: America must reverse course from the energy subtraction agenda of past administrations and strengthen our electrical grid,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a press release.
The Trump administration has slashed far more than just the Grain Belt Express’ funding.
Since taking office, Trump has yanked billions in Biden-era loans and grants for clean-energy projects and clawed back incentives for the sector in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.","The Department of Energy has closed a $1.6 billion loan guarantee for transmission upgrades in the middle of the country — a move that comes as the Trump administration slashes funding for other grid improvements, including a separate transmission megaproject in the Midwest.

The financing from the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office will go to a subsidiary of utility giant American Electric Power to overhaul around 5,000 miles of power lines across Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, and West Virginia. The agency called the deal ​“the first closed loan guarantee” under a new ​“Energy Dominance Financing Program” established by President Donald Trump’s landmark tax law, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

Despite the Energy Dominance branding, the loan guarantee was originally announced in mid-January by the Biden administration as part of a broader $22.4 billion push to strengthen the grid using LPO funding. The Trump administration has now finalized that loan in a rare example of continuity between the administrations on energy policy.

In a statement, the Energy Department said that ​“all electric utilities receiving an EDF loan must provide assurance to DOE that financial benefits from the financing will be passed on to the customers of that utility.” A spokesperson for the agency did not immediately respond to Canary Media’s email requesting comment on how those assurances will be monitored and enforced.

“The President has been clear: America must reverse course from the energy subtraction agenda of past administrations and strengthen our electrical grid,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a press release. ​“This loan guarantee will not only help modernize the grid and expand transmission capacity but will help position the United States to win the AI race and grow our manufacturing base.”

The United States needs more transmission lines to upgrade the aging grid, create room for additional power generation, and increase reliability by making it easier to share electrons across regions. Much of the U.S. grid was built in the 1960s and 1970s, and about 70% of existing transmission lines are over 25 years old and approaching the end of their typical life cycle.

Despite this, the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office canceled a $4.9 billion loan guarantee in July to finance construction of the Grain Belt Express, a major transmission project more than a decade in the works and designed to channel power from wind and solar farms in the Great Plains to cities in more densely populated eastern states.

The termination came a week after Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, told The New York Times that he had made a personal appeal to Trump to block the project.

“He said, ​‘Well, let’s just resolve this now,’” Hawley told the newspaper. ​“So he got Chris Wright on the line right there.”

Hawley’s hostility to the Grain Belt Express followed a playbook that has long been deployed by actors across the political spectrum to block transmission projects, amplifying not-in-my-backyard opponents’ anger over seizures of land through eminent domain. In this case, Missouri farmers balked at the transmission route running through their land without, in their view, providing enough direct benefits.

A similar dynamic tanked construction of the 700-mile-long transmission project that Clean Line Energy Partners wanted to build to connect wind farms in Oklahoma to energy users in Tennessee nearly a decade ago, as chronicled in journalist Russell Gold’s book, ​“Superpower: One Man’s Quest to Transform American Energy.” In Maine, meanwhile, environmental groups teamed up with fossil-fuel companies to pass a 2021 referendum banning construction of a power line connecting New England’s electricity-starved grid to Quebec’s almost-entirely carbon-free hydroelectric system.

The Trump administration has slashed far more than just the Grain Belt Express’ funding. Since taking office, Trump has yanked billions in Biden-era loans and grants for clean-energy projects and clawed back incentives for the sector in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. One of the few projects to receive steady funding under Trump’s Loan Programs Office has been nuclear developer Holtec International’s bid to restart the Palisades plant in Michigan, which aims to come back online before the end of the year.

The administration also in early October announced a list of billions of dollars more in clean-energy funding cuts targeted primarily at blue states — a list that included 26 grants from the DOE’s Grid Deployment Office, most of which are meant to expand the grid and boost its reliability.

(Hartford, CT) – Attorney General William Tong announced today Connecticut, 21 other states and the District of Columbia are suing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin for illegally ending a $7 billion program that lowers energy costs and pollution by bringing solar energy to more than 900,000 households in low-income and disadvantaged communities across the country.

Connecticut and 23 other grant recipients also filed suit yesterday in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims to recover damages for EPA’s unlawful breach of the grant agreements that were executed under this program.

Congress created the Solar for All program in 2022 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, directing EPA to make competitive grants to states and other entities to deploy solar projects in low-income and disadvantaged areas. EPA selected recipients and awarded all of the program funds to plaintiff states and other grant recipients by August 2024. Connecticut and the other plaintiffs moved forward with planning projects and working with stakeholders to develop their solar programs.

But EPA abruptly and unlawfully terminated the program two months ago and clawed back the vast majority of the money already awarded. That has left Connecticut and the other plaintiffs without access to the funds to proceed with their solar programs, after the states spent significant time planning and launching programs and committing state funds.

Connecticut was awarded and received $62.45 million in Solar for All funding in 2024 to increase access to solar and energy storage technologies for low-income and disadvantaged communities, including multifamily affordable housing. Working with the Connecticut Green Bank and the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority, the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection expected to assist 7,400 households through increased incentives, new loans and lease programs for residential solar and energy storage. The work would save $76.2 million for participating households.

On August 7, 2005, EPA liquidated the DEEP account that had contained the full remaining $62 million balance of the grant and suspended Connecticut’s access to the grant account. Later, with no explanation, the account balance was changed to $4.34 million. To date, EPA has yet to provide DEEP with any explanation regarding the changes to the grant.

“Donald Trump’s irrational fixation on renewable energy is costing all of us. Just like with Revolution Wind, Trump is trying to tank our opportunities to secure clean, affordable energy and keep us dependent on fossil fuels and foreign oil. Congress created the Solar for All program, and EPA awarded these funds so that Connecticut could help low-income residents save millions of dollars on their energy bills. Trump cannot unilaterally reverse course now, and we’re suing to make sure Connecticut gets every penny we are owed,” said Attorney General Tong.

“The Trump EPA’s attempt to cancel the Solar For All program reduces access to clean, affordable solar energy for thousands of Connecticut residents,” DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes said. “Connecticut’s Solar for All program would help residents, particularly those in multi-family affordable housing, and communities, access the benefits of clean solar energy and the much-needed cost savings it can provide. This program would also help us improve our air quality, which is among the worst in the nation, and make our electric grid more resilient. EPA’s action runs completely counter to our efforts to bring affordable, clean, and reliable energy to Connecticut residents.”

When President Trump took office this past January, he prioritized fossil fuel extraction to address an alleged “energy emergency” while arbitrarily excluding solar power as a resource that can be tapped to meet the country’s energy needs. In July, Congress passed the president’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” rescinding funds for the Solar for All program that were unobligated as of July 3. The effect of that move was small, given that EPA had obligated all of the $7 billion for the program nearly a year earlier.

But instead of following that newly passed law, EPA and Zeldin illegally terminated the program on August 7. On social media, Zeldin made baseless accusations, calling Solar for All a “boondoggle.” The agency then sent memos to all recipients, including the plaintiffs, saying EPA no longer has a “statutory basis or dedicated funding” for the program, even though Congress never directed EPA to cancel funds that had already been awarded. In fact, Congress did the opposite by only rescinding unobligated funds for Solar for All.

Attorney General Tong and a multistate coalition are filing a lawsuit today in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, alleging, among other things, that the EPA violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the U.S. Constitution’s Separation of Powers Doctrine in unlawfully canceling the program.

The attorneys general of Arizona, Minnesota, and Washington are leading the complaint, which was joined by the attorneys general of California, Colorado, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Hawaiʻi, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Vermont. Also joining the complaint are the governors of Kentucky and Pennsylvania, as well as the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation.

Separately, Connecticut joined a lawsuit that was filed yesterday in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. In that complaint, the states and other entities argue the EPA breached the clear terms of the agreements and violated the duty of good faith and fair dealing in canceling their Solar for All grants. They’re asking the court to award the plaintiffs money damages, interest, and fees.

One of the unintended consequences of this consumer trend is the effect on gas tax revenue.

Every gasoline and diesel sale in the U.S. includes a small added tax. This tax is used to fund state transportation budgets, highway maintenance, and infrastructure projects. As a result of more EVs on the road, the amount of revenue generated by the gas tax is decreasing. This has created interesting financial repercussions, and a variety of solutions are being adopted to help.

Using state-by-state fuel tax data from the Department of Energy and consumer EV trends from the Alternative Fuels Data Center, CheapInsurance.com analyzed the economic impact of the changing transportation landscape and what’s being done to remedy the situation.

Nationwide EV adoption trends

Millions of Americans are choosing to purchase electric vehicles over traditional gas ones. The reasons include reduced charging costs compared to gas, lower emissions, and tax incentives.

The Bureau of Transportation Statistics reported that, in 2024, there were 1.2 million electric vehicle sales and 1.6 million hybrid electric vehicle sales. This is up from 238,000 EV sales and 455,000 hybrid-electric sales in 2020. This upward trend is likely to continue.

New EV registrations by state

The rate at which EVs are being bought and put on the road differs by state. This is mainly influenced by government policies, cultural attitudes, and economic factors.

For example, California has recently tried to enact an EV mandate that requires a certain percentage of new vehicle sales to be fully electric. This plan was then adopted by 11 other states. Although later blocked by the Senate, this prompted many consumers to transition to EVs.

Culturally, many Americans across the country do not want EVs, which explains lower purchase numbers in some states. The Pew Research Center found that, in May 2025, only 18% of Republicans and Republican-leaning individuals were at least somewhat interested in purchasing one. This is compared to Democrats, with 48% somewhat or very interested. This data was collected via a survey of Americans conducted from April 28 to May 4, 2025. This suggests that “red states” will have lower numbers of EV registrations than “blue states.”

The states with the highest EV registration numbers per 100,000 residents have the most significant loss in gas tax revenue. The number of EV vehicles on the road compared to gasoline vehicles is still quite low, so impacts are not being strongly felt yet. However, many states are predicting substantial losses in their gas tax revenue over the next decade.

In California, for example, the Mineta Transportation Institute predicts that there will be a 64% loss in revenue from 2025 to 2040. In this study, researchers considered eight different scenarios, each with a different rate of how many EVs are purchased, how many people in the state drive, and how many personal vehicles get registered. Results used 2024 inflation-adjusted numbers.

Budget impacts on state transportation departments

Millions of dollars in losses will have a severe impact on state highway and transportation departments if left unaddressed. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 2024 data pulled from the National Association of State Budget Officers states that gas tax revenue accounts for 35.9% of state transportation department revenue nationwide.

Without this revenue, several impacts will be felt:

Deficits in highway and road maintenance

Slower completion of infrastructure projects

Less development and expansion

Higher vehicle maintenance costs for the general population

How states are responding and planning for the future

States are recognizing that action needs to be taken to secure transportation budgets. Pew Research Center reports that many states are suffering from budget gaps and are having difficulty completing projects like bridge repairs.

To tackle the issue of reduced gas tax revenue, many states have begun taking measures and implementing programs that will generate revenue from electric vehicles instead.

EV registration fees

The most significant way that governmental bodies have buoyed transportation department revenue is with EV registration fees. These fees are charged at the initial time of registration and on an annual basis.

In Texas, for example, EV owners must pay $400 for the first-time registration and $200 each year, according to the Department of Energy.

Road usage charges

Other states are opting for a road usage fee. In Hawai‘i, EV owners are given the option to pay an annual, per-mile usage fee instead of a large registration fee. This is currently set at $0.08/mile, up to $50/year.

Oregon offers a similar program, called OReGO. California is also experimenting with its own pilot program.

What changes are needed on the road ahead?

It’s clear that policy change is needed to address the compounding loss in gas tax revenue as a result of widespread EV adoption. The amount of revenue that will need to be replaced is unclear, however, especially with an anticipated decline in EV demand due to the federal tax incentives ending.

Regardless, state agencies and the federal government will need to prioritize alternative methods for generating revenue. This could be through registration fees, road usage programs, or other revenue-generating systems that are put into place. It’s likely that the EV marketplace will continue to grow and that more households will begin replacing their gas vehicles, so prompt change is needed in the coming years.

The planned Cascade Advanced Energy Facility in Washington, which will be built by Energy Northwest with funding from Amazon, will deploy 12 small modular reactors, Amazon said in a Thursday release.

The “modular nature” of the plant means that three 320-MW sections will together comprise a 960-MW plant within the space of a few city blocks, in contrast to “traditional nuclear power facilities whose single GW plant can take up more than a square mile of land,” Amazon said.

The SMRs will be supplied by X-energy, which received $500 million in Series C funding from Amazon last year, using X-energy’s advanced nuclear reactor design. The Cascade facility will be built outside Richland, Washington, near Energy Northwest’s Columbia Generating Station.

X-energy’s “advanced reactor design, the Xe-100, will be used in Amazon’s partnership with Energy Northwest to develop four SMRs in the first phase of Cascade, with an initial capacity of 320 MW and the option to expand to 12 units with a capacity of 960 MW,” Amazon said in its release.

Construction is expected to start at the end of the decade, “with operations targeted to start in the 2030s,” Amazon said.

Energy Northwest, a consortium of 29 public utility districts and municipalities across Washington, said in 2024 that the deal with Amazon would meet an “urgent need to develop advanced technologies in the Pacific Northwest that provide reliable, carbon-free and sustainable energy generation.”

“The SMRs will be the Xe-100 design, a high-temperature gas-cooled reactor developed by X-energy ... Each Xe-100 module can provide 80 megawatts of full-time electricity,” Energy Northwest said.

Amazon’s Thursday release said the energy will help power AI and other digital tools.

X-energy and Amazon, along with Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power and Doosan Enerbility, also signed a strategic collaboration agreement in August to “accelerate the deployment of new Xe-100 advanced nuclear reactors in the United States to meet increasing power demands by data centers, advanced manufacturing, and electrification,” according to a release from X-energy.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/p7XAZXjpoxOtTWHqsNXTkdm6r1slpbXYZCR5n3Gtq_Q/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9jYWVmLTdfMS5wbmc=.webp,N,,2025-10-16 12:11:46.518215

The EPA’s report on a PFAS compound called Perfluorononanoic Acid (PFNA) concluded that PFNA can cause developmental, liver, and reproductive harm, including lower birth weights and reduced testosterone and sperm levels. According to ProPublica’s reporting, internal EPA documents and agency scientists confirmed that the report was “completed and ready to post” in April, needing only final briefings to leadership.

In a letter to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, Pingree said the delay is part of a “growing pattern of interference with the Agency’s scientific work.”

“The delay in issuing the PFNA report coincided with EPA’s decision, in May of this year, to rescind some PFAS Safe Drinking Water Act regulations, one of which happens to be PFNA,” Pingree said. “This seems to be more than coincidence given that there has been strong industry pushback on regulating PFAS.”

“We both know that PFAS poses a significant public health threat to our water, food supply, and farming communities. It is necessary to take steps to combat PFAS contamination, yet this delay and erosion of capacity directly contradict your repeated public statements about both transparency and the need for strong, science-based PFAS policies,” she continued.

Pingree called on Zeldin to explain the delay—including who directed it—and asks when he will commit to releasing the PFNA assessment and ensuring future IRIS reports are free from political interference.

The letter is available here and copied below.

Background

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are dangerous man-made “forever chemicals” that pose serious risks to public health and the environment, appearing at our former military installations, farms, and water systems. PFAS chemicals are persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic. These chemicals have been linked to harmful human health effects, including cancer, reproductive and developmental harms, and weakened immune systems.

This is an urgent public health and environmental threat, and it’s growing at an alarming rate—in Maine, there have been more than 30,000 records of PFAS at close to 250 sites across the state.

Earlier this year, the EPA announced plans to rescind and reconsider limits on four “forever chemicals”—weakening landmark drinking water standards implemented under President Biden.

In July, Pingree and David Rouzer (R-N.C.) reintroduced the bipartisan Healthy Drinking Water Affordability Act, or the Healthy H2O Act, to help make water testing and treatment technology more accessible by providing grants for water testing and treatment technology directly to individuals and nonprofits in rural communities.

In both the Fiscal Year 2023 and Fiscal Year 2024 government funding bills, Pingree secured $8 million for the EPA to work to further research on PFAS contamination in agriculture, and EPA awarded $15 million in grant funding to ten institutions last September to research and reduce exposure to PFAS in agriculture.

Dear Administrator Zeldin,

I write to you today regarding reports that your Agency is withholding a scientific assessment on Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) and a growing pattern of interference with the Agency’s scientific work, especially towards the Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) program. A recent article states that the EPA is delaying the release of a report on a PFAS compound called Perfluorononanoic Acid (PFNA) that was due out in April of this year.

The delay in issuing the PFNA report coincided with EPA’s decision, in May of this year, to rescind some PFAS Safe Drinking Water Act regulations, one of which happens to be PFNA. This seems to be more than coincidence given that there has been strong industry pushback on regulating PFAS. The Trump Administration, Republicans in Congress, and industry have been hostile to the IRIS program which conducts these assessments. IRIS has consistently been a target with repeated attempts to weaken or dismantle its ability to perform independent scientific reviews of chemicals, like PFNA.

We both know that PFAS poses a significant public health threat to our water, food supply, and farming communities. It is necessary to take steps to combat PFAS contamination, yet this delay and erosion of capacity directly contradict your repeated public statements about both transparency and the need for strong, science-based PFAS policies. You recently announced the PFAS OUTreach Initiative to help protect communities and ensure water systems are in compliance with PFAS drinking water standards by providing resources, tools, and technical assistance. But by not releasing this report you are limiting the Agency’s ability to provide that assistance and ultimately protect communities from PFAS contamination.

I request clear answers to the following:

Why has the PFNA toxicity assessment not been released? Who directed its delay?

Have IRIS staff been reassigned or reduced under your leadership, if so, why?

When will you commit to releasing the PFNA assessment publicly and ensuring that future IRIS reports are published without political interference?

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter that concerns the health of millions of Americans.

The head of Imola Automotive USA — the startup that promised to create 45,000 electric vehicle jobs in struggling U.S. towns — acknowledged Tuesday that the company has been unable to secure land in two of the communities where it had proposed building manufacturing plants.

Still, he said, Imola hopes to break ground on a plant in Fort Valley, Georgia, within nine to 12 months.

During a press conference there on Tuesday, Imola CEO Rodney Henry said the company plans to build a 40-acre solar farm to help power the plant. Henry was joined by Fort Valley Mayor Jeffery Lundy, who said the project would include a 500,000-square-foot manufacturing plant along with retail development and housing for workers.

""We're here to create jobs,"" Henry told reporters. ""We're here to help the community.""

Said Lundy: ""Imola is coming to Fort Valley.""

Company representatives said Imola has received zoning approvals in Fort Valley but still needs to secure financing and obtain final design approval.

In January 2024, Imola announced plans to build six EV plants in the United States. But more than 18 months later, the company has yet to break ground on a single site, Floodlight reported in a story published in August.

Jay Taylor, an attorney representing Imola, acknowledged in a Friday letter to Floodlight that ""while the projects have most certainly experienced material delays, the plans and the commitment to see them to fruition remain in effect.""

In early 2024, Imola Automotive USA and the Tazzari Group — an Italian firm best known for its electric two-seater micro cars — jointly announced plans for a partnership.

The EVs that Tazzari makes in Italy aren't designed for highway driving. Top speed on the company's Opensky Sport model is about 56 miles per hour, while maximum speed on the Opensky Limited is about 37 mph, according to the company's website.

In response to a question from a reporter about the highway worthiness of the EVs, Henry responded the company plans to modify those cars so they can go up to 80 miles per hour.

Henry said Fort Valley is now the company's top priority. He was less definitive about the future of proposals to build Imola plants in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, and Langston, Oklahoma.

In Fort Valley, officials initially backed a plan for an EV facility expected to employ 7,500. But with no visible progress a year later, the company returned with a new pitch — a 99-year lighting contract. One council member called it a ""bait and switch.""

Pierre Turner, Imola's in-house counsel, said Tuesday that he has advised the company to drop the lighting project because ""it wouldn't be a good investment.""

Turner stressed that while Imola hopes to break ground on the EV factory in nine to 12 months, the company doesn't know how tariffs and the global economy will affect its plans so ""we're not promising.""

Officials in Pine Bluff last year pledged land and infrastructure for a plant that was supposed to bring 8,000 jobs. But a year later, former Mayor Shirley Washington told Floodlight: ""We never did get off the ground with that.""

Henry said on Tuesday that the town wasn't able to provide the land needed to build a plant there.

In Langston — where over a third of residents live in poverty — an Imola representative cited problems acquiring land. The company had asked the city to transfer vacant property and issue bonds. City council member Magnus Scott told Floodlight that the deal was canceled before anything moved forward.

Henry said the company never canceled its plans in Langston. Property that Imola had hoped to build on in Langston became ""unsecured,"" Henry acknowledged. ""So we didn't have property to continue the project.""

Scott could not be reached for comment on Tuesday.

Henry, who lives in Florida, has no prior experience in auto manufacturing. His background includes work as a television executive producer and the founder of an athletic footwear brand.

In July, he declined to speak with Floodlight, instead issuing a brief statement saying the company's timetable ""has been modified due to matters outside of our control,"" and that it remains ""highly focused on bringing our goals into alignment.""

Floodlight submitted detailed questions to Henry and Taylor on Friday, requesting, among other things, details on the status of each proposed EV plant. Taylor responded on Monday night, writing, ""Mr. Henry has agreed to provide responses at his earliest convenience.""

As of Tuesday evening, Henry had not responded.",https://scalawagmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/250902_KAT_ImolaFortValleyPressConference_001-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 11:18:03.587062

Strategic investments in the US market The company’s commitment to the US market is evident in its substantial investments and strategic partnerships.
“It’s not insignificant—$12 billion is a big investment, and it really shows our commitment to being here in the U.S. and supporting this market,” Schnell emphasized.
“Their team even traveled to our Suwon plant in Korea to study operations and bring some best practices back to Georgia,” Schnell noted.
SK Battery America’s facility in Georgia spans 2.7 million square feet across two plants, with a production capacity of 22 gigawatt-hours per year.","At the Battery Show North America, Rob Schnell, President North America at SK On, presented “The New Battery Frontier: Growth, Innovation, and Opportunity in North America.” During his presentation, Schnell outlined SK On’s approach to addressing the evolving needs of the battery industry. He discussed the company’s investments, technological advancements, and efforts to support the growing demand for electric vehicles (EVs) and energy storage systems (ESS).

Strategic growth pillars

In his speech, Schnell outlined the company’s innovation strategy, highlighting its dedication to advancing the future of electrification through the following four strategic growth pillars:

1. Product innovation at the cell level: SK On is pushing the boundaries of battery technology by focusing on energy density, charge speed, and safety. Schnell highlights the company’s efforts to expand form factors, advance chemistries, and accelerate research and development (R&D).

SK On has also relied on partnerships. For example, the company partnered with L&F to establish a foundation for producing US-made lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries. Schnell emphasized, “We know the market will need more than just high nickel, and we will be there to supply it.”

Youngkee Shin (L), Head of Procurement at SK On, and Byunghee Lee, Chief Operating Officer of L&F, pose for a photo after signing a memorandum of understanding on the supply of LFP cathode materials at SK On’s Green Campus in Seoul on July 10. Courtesy of SK On..

Additionally, he said that the battery builder is exploring next-generation technologies such as cell-to-pack integration, dry coating, thermal propagation prevention, and solid-state batteries, aiming to reduce costs, improve safety, and scale production efficiently. He continued, “We launched a pilot facility in South Korea with our partner, Solid Power, to commercialize an all-solid-state battery by 2029 with a long-term target energy density of 1000 watt hours per liter (Wh/L).”

2. Factory innovation (Industry 4.0):

SK On is embracing Industry 4.0 principles by deploying advanced AI, automated equipment, and smart factory technologies. “We’re deploying advanced AI, significantly automated equipment, and smart factories to help us scale efficiently and reduce costs,” Schnell noted.

SK Battery America in Georgia, a 2.6 billion-dollar investment, exemplifies this approach. The facility produces 22 gigawatt-hours annually and employs over 3,000 people, leveraging cutting-edge automated equipment and strict quality control measures.

3. Expansion into new applications: The company is diversifying its business by expanding into energy storage systems (ESS) and other applications such as commercial vehicles, construction, and agriculture. “We already started in energy storage with our Flatiron partnership, and we’re continuing to explore different sectors within e-mobility,” Schnell said. According to him, the ESS market is growing rapidly, with US demand expected to exceed 100 gigawatts by 2030 from 40 gigawatts.

4. Value chain expansion: SK On is actively expanding its value chain by focusing on battery recycling, leveraging end-of-life battery technologies, and pursuing vertical integration. “We’re focusing on leveraging scrap and end-of-life batteries,” Schnell explained.

The company is also making strategic investments in energy sector businesses, such as its acquisition of SK Signet, a company specializing in EV charging technology. “We’re making strategic investments in other businesses within the energy sector,” Schnell said, emphasizing the importance of vertical integration in maintaining competitiveness.

Strategic investments in the US market

The company’s commitment to the US market is evident in its substantial investments and strategic partnerships. The company has contributed or committed approximately $12 billion in capital in the US, establishing a strong presence in key battery belt states such as Georgia and Kentucky. “It’s not insignificant—$12 billion is a big investment, and it really shows our commitment to being here in the U.S. and supporting this market,” Schnell emphasized.

Georgia serves as a critical hub for SK On’s operations in the US, offering logistical advantages, state partnerships, and access to top talent. Schnell explained, “Georgia is a global hub for EV manufacturing. It offers direct access to the interstate and rail corridors, proximity to the Savannah and Brunswick ports, and clean energy from the Vogtle nuclear power facility.”

The state’s Quick Start Program has been instrumental in hiring and training employees. “Their team even traveled to our Suwon plant in Korea to study operations and bring some best practices back to Georgia,” Schnell noted. Additionally, partnerships with institutions like Georgia Tech and the University of Georgia have helped build a pipeline of skilled technicians and engineers.

SK Battery America’s facility in Georgia spans 2.7 million square feet across two plants, with a production capacity of 22 gigawatt-hours per year. Schnell described the scale of the facility: “Each plant is nearly half a mile long, roughly the length of 10 football fields played end to end. It’s hard to put your head around unless you’ve been there.”

In Kentucky, SK On has partnered with Ford to develop the BlueOval site, further solidifying its presence in the US market. This joint venture aims to secure long-term supply for customers, localize high-value manufacturing, and create capacity to scale advanced chemistries and cell technologies. “We want to secure long-term supply for our customers and localize high-value manufacturing to reduce logistics and tariff exposure,” Schnell explained.

The Future and challenges of battery manufacturers

Schnell stated that despite slower-than-anticipated growth in EV adoption, the market is expanding steadily. By 2025, EVs are expected to account for 8-9% of new vehicle sales in the US, reaching 19-23% by 2030 and 35% by 2035, where he acknowledged, “EV adoption is growing slower than early forecasts suggested, but let’s not forget, it’s still growing.”

The future for battery manufacturers is marked by complexity, with challenges such as policy shifts, cost pressures, and fluctuating demand signals shaping the industry landscape. As he acknowledges, “This is a long journey, but we are prepared.” SK On is focused on strategic areas that ensure it remains competitive, adaptable, and well-positioned across diverse markets, not just mobility.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltb299798942522069/bltac869ddb4670d4f3/68f10285ae6223c276af81a6/Schnell_SKOn.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-16 11:15:36.351425

With geopolitical competition reshaping global energy flows, Africa’s role as a supplier of hydrocarbons, LNG and transition minerals has taken on new significance – positioning the continent as a critical arena for energy security, supply diversification and investment competition among major powers.

The United States: Driving Upstream Exploration and Infrastructure

At AEW, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz called for a revitalized American energy presence in Africa, emphasizing exploration, production and midstream infrastructure as the foundation for future engagement, reinforced by a dedicated U.S.-Africa Roundtable. U.S. companies such as ExxonMobil, Kosmos Energy and Chevron are expanding their exploration portfolios in West and East Africa – including deepwater projects in Namibia, Mozambique and Equatorial Guinea.

The U.S. approach reflects a broader strategy to diversify global energy supplies and counterbalance rival influences, particularly from China and Russia. Washington is leveraging private capital alongside technical partnerships, focusing on high-return exploration and LNG development opportunities under a pro-oil administration and a commercially driven diplomatic strategy.

Looking ahead to Invest in African Energy (IAE) 2026 in Paris – a key forum where African governments, investors and industry leaders converge to negotiate new projects and structure strategic partnerships – heightened American participation is expected. Delegations are likely to spotlight new acreage bids, innovative project financing models and joint venture opportunities with African national oil companies.

Russia: Expanding Energy Diplomacy through Technology Transfer

Russia, meanwhile, is advancing a more holistic African energy agenda. During a Russia-Africa Roundtable at AEW, Russian officials underscored partnerships with Equatorial Guinea and the Republic of the Congo, as well as ongoing collaboration through Rosatom, which is leading the country’s nuclear engagement on the continent. Rosatom is working with Rwanda to establish a nuclear science and technology center and has signed cooperation agreements with Mali and Guinea-Conakry.

Floating nuclear power units, small modular reactors and integrated gas infrastructure form the backbone of Russia’s energy offering. By pairing commercial energy solutions with technology transfer, Moscow aims to help African nations meet growing domestic demand while deepening political and trade ties. At IAE 2026 in Paris, Russia is expected to pursue further cooperation agreements in nuclear and gas-to-power development, reinforcing the country’s ambition to secure a lasting role across Africa’s energy value chain.

The UAE: Deploying Sovereign Capital for Scale and Integration

The United Arab Emirates is taking a long-term approach to Africa’s energy and infrastructure development. Emirati sovereign wealth funds, development agencies and energy majors are expanding their footprint across oil and gas, solar, hydrogen and integrated energy logistics. At AEW, Sharif Al Olama, Under-Secretary for Energy and Petroleum Affairs at the Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure, invited African nations and energy companies to join the Global Energy Efficiency Alliance, an initiative launched by the UAE to double energy efficiency rates and accelerate the transition to clean energy. Through companies such as ADNOC, Masdar and AMEA Power, the UAE is financing large-scale solar and hydrogen projects across North and West Africa.

Something else happened in the world of electrification in September, and while it may not be as thrilling, it’s still a major milestone.

According to the UK-based research firm Rho Motion, which specializes in EV-related data, global sales of electrified light vehicles – including battery-electric vehicles (BEV) and plug-in hybrids (PHEV) – set a new monthly record in September, surpassing 2.1 million units. That figure represents a 26% increase compared to the same month last year.

China Leads The Charge

Unsurprisingly, China continues to dominate the global EV market by a significant margin. The country accounted for the majority of global sales, with more than 1.3 million electrified vehicles sold in September alone. Of those, just over 800,000 units were BEVs – an impressive 28% increase year-on-year and a new record for China. PHEV sales, however, dipped slightly to just under 500,000 units, marking a 2% decline. Despite that, China’s performance remains unmatched. Over the first nine months of 2025, Chinese consumers purchased nearly nine million electrified vehicles, representing a 24% rise compared to the same period in 2024.

Europe ranked as the second-largest market for electrified vehicles. According to Rho Motion’s data, European consumers bought approximately 427,000 electrified vehicles in September – a 36% year-on-year increase. Demand continues to strengthen thanks to various incentive programs rolling out across key countries such as the UK and Germany. Unlike China, Europe’s growth leans more heavily toward PHEVs. In the UK, for instance, BEV sales in September rose 30%, while PHEV sales surged nearly 60% compared to the previous year. This trend suggests that many European buyers still value the flexibility of hybrid technology as charging infrastructure expands.

Across the Atlantic, the US also posted record figures. Electrified vehicle sales jumped 66% year-on-year in September, reaching about 215,000 units. It marked the second straight month of growth and capped off a record-breaking third quarter. According to Cox Automotive, US BEV sales totaled 438,487 units in the third quarter – up 20% from the same period in 2024, which had previously been the record high. BEVs made up roughly 10.5% of total US vehicle sales during the quarter, underscoring their growing footprint in the market. However, this record demand may prove short-lived.

A Slowdown Looms In The US

Analysts attribute the surge in US BEV sales not to a fundamental market shift but to buyers rushing to purchase vehicles before federal tax credits expired on September 30. While most automakers saw higher BEV sales during the rush, some brands – including BMW, Nissan, and Toyota – recorded declines.

With the federal incentives now gone and states such as California backing out of offering alternative programs, industry experts expect BEV demand in the US to drop sharply in the fourth quarter. In anticipation, automakers like General Motors, Mercedes-Benz, and Volkswagen have already scaled back production. Others – including GM, Hyundai, and even Maserati – have introduced discounts and promotional offers to help offset the loss of federal tax credits and maintain sales momentum.",https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cropped-p90422144_highres_v2.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-16 13:03:44.779805

“If you don’t get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail,” he told the world leaders in attendance.
Studies have shown that fake news about climate change is more compelling to people than scientific facts.
Climate advocates are increasingly connecting climate change to inflation and the rising cost of living, in an effort to reach Americans struggling with high electricity bills.
“We can’t help but be exposed to propaganda,” Hobbs said, “but how we react to it is up to us.”","The phrase that has come to define the Trump administration’s message on climate change was born in Durham, New Hampshire, on December 16, 2023.

Flanked by flannel-clad supporters holding “Live free or die” signs, then-candidate Donald Trump wished the crowd a Merry Christmas before launching into what he saw as the biggest faults of the current administration. He swung at President Biden himself (“crooked Joe”) and the state of the economy (“Bidenomics”). About 10 minutes in, he arrived at Biden’s climate policies, which he said were “wasting trillions of dollars on Green New Deal nonsense.”

But Trump wasn’t satisfied with his choice of insult, perhaps recognizing that echoing “Green New Deal” served to amplify his opponents’ pro-climate action rallying cry. So in front of the crowd, he began riffing on ways to undermine it in real time.

“They don’t know what they’re doing, but you’re going to be in the poorhouse to fund his big government Green New Deal, which is a socialist scam. And you know what? You have to be careful. It’s going to put us all in big trouble,” he said. “The Green New Deal that doesn’t work. It’s a Green New Scam. Let’s call it, from now on, the ‘Green New Scam.'”

The crowd roared, shaking their signs in approval. “I do like that term, and I just came up with that one,” Trump said. “The Green New Scam. It will forever be known as the Green New Scam.”

There’s been plenty of attention on Trump’s purge of climate change language, and for good reason: Government workers are tiptoeing around vocabulary they once used freely. “Clean energy,” “climate science,” and “pollution” are on the list of “woke” words federal agencies have told employees to avoid. Recently, a memo circulated at the Department of Energy’s renewable energy office advised employees to remove or rephrase basic terms including “climate change,” “emissions,” and “green.” But the administration is doing more than making these phrases disappear. It’s also introducing new language designed to undermine the foundations upon which trust in climate science and policy is built.

In the nine months since Trump began his second presidency, the phrase “Green New Scam” — always capitalized — has appeared in White House fact sheets and press statements, echoed across federal agencies and by Republicans in Congress.

“He’s quite effective at creating sticky phrases and using repetition to amplify them,” said Renee Hobbs, a communications professor at the University of Rhode Island who wrote a book on modern propaganda. “That’s the classic propaganda strategy, right? You repeat the phrases that you want to stick, and you downplay, ignore, minimize, or censor the concepts that don’t meet your agenda.”

It’s part of a broader effort to erase information about how the planet is changing. In recent months, the administration has axed entire pages about climate change and how to adapt to it, said Gretchen Gehrke, who monitors federal websites with the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative. The 400 experts working on the government’s next official climate report were dismissed, then all the past reports vanished, too. The administration has proposed stopping long-running projects that monitor carbon dioxide levels, and the Environmental Protection Agency is no longer collecting greenhouse gas emissions data from polluting companies.

You could see it as a three-pronged strategy. First, erase language related to climate change. Second, dismantle the scientific foundation supporting it. Third, fill the void with a message that matches Trump’s political priorities — like the “Green New Scam.”

“We’ve always understood language shapes reality, and language can create unreal realities,” Hobbs said. “And I think that’s what Trump is doing with his language of climate change.”

In Trump’s growing arsenal of anti-climate catchphrases, “Green New Scam” remains a go-to weapon. The Green New Deal concept was a ripe target for Trump because it serves as a catch-all for progressive positions, said Josh Freed, senior vice president for climate and energy at the think tank Third Way. “That was the target that I think Trump honed in on and flipped the script on, and turned it into a vulnerability and catchphrase for what he felt the public would see as positions that were extreme,” he said.

Trump has taken the idea to an international audience. In his speech to the United Nations General Assembly last month, he spent a full 10 minutes ranting off-script about climate policy, deriding renewables and international efforts to address climate change. “If you don’t get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail,” he told the world leaders in attendance.

In the same speech, he went on to call climate change “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.” He also claimed that “the carbon footprint is a hoax made up by people with evil intentions.”

Conspiracy theories are a common tool in propaganda, according to Hobbs. “Conspiracy theories are catnip because they postulate this malevolent actor who’s doing something secretly to hurt people, and humans are hardwired to pay attention to stuff like that,” she said. Studies have shown that fake news about climate change is more compelling to people than scientific facts.

Still, Trump is fighting an uphill battle trying to paint climate change as fake. About 70 percent of Americans acknowledge that global warming is happening. Meanwhile, recent polling found that most Americans don’t trust Republicans on the environment, with only 23 percent preferring the party’s plan for tackling environmental issues.

But if a phrase gets repeated often enough, it can begin to bend reality, even if it’s inaccurate. It’s a rule that Trump intuitively understands, and a driving force behind his linguistic prescriptions. “I have a little standing order in the White House — never use the word ‘coal,’ only use the words ‘clean, beautiful coal,’” Trump said in his speech to the U.N. “Sounds much better, doesn’t it?”

Coal may be dirty by basically every yardstick people use to decide whether something is clean, but the phrase “clean coal” could still change people’s associations with the fuel. “If you can control vocabulary, you’re controlling thought,” said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a professor of communication at the University of Pennsylvania who has spent decades studying campaign messaging. Once we adopt a new set of terms, those words start doing the thinking for us, she said. People absorb the assumptions that are baked into them, often without even noticing.

Jamieson says it’s part of a broader strategy to boost fossil fuels over renewable energy sources like solar and wind. The Trump administration has canceled billions of funding in clean energy projects while simultaneously fast-tracking permits for new pipelines and other fossil fuel infrastructure. Last month, the Energy Department announced it would pour $625 million into rescuing the coal industry, which has been dying as natural gas and renewables have taken off.

“The administration is trying to align the vocabulary through which we talk about the environment with policies that are consistent with increased drilling,” Jamieson said. “You don’t have to do much work to see the relationship between the policies and the language.”

As for how to respond to propaganda, Hobbs said that turning to facts — like scientists and journalists often do — is not the most effective strategy. Research has long shown that feelings are more important than facts in changing people’s minds. “You fight propaganda with propaganda, right?” she said. Climate advocates are increasingly connecting climate change to inflation and the rising cost of living, in an effort to reach Americans struggling with high electricity bills.

On the micro level, Hobbs said she’s seen success in online experiments where people engaged in genuine, open conversations about different propaganda topics, from free speech rights to the role of social media influencers. The format prompted people to talk about conspiracy theories they’ve encountered, what feelings those stories evoked, and which ones were harmful. Participants were encouraged to open up about their uncertainties and where they were coming from — and in doing so, they often came to their own realization that their beliefs might be influenced by propaganda. Hobbs said that people decreased their fear of others who thought differently and became more critical about the information they were receiving.

“We can’t help but be exposed to propaganda,” Hobbs said, “but how we react to it is up to us.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Trump-microphones.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-10-16 13:04:05.685183

That has left Washington and the other plaintiffs without access to the funds to proceed with their solar programs.
In Washington, for example, EPA’s illegal move jeopardizes $156 million for qualifying solar projects in the state.","Washington and 22 other plaintiffs are suing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin for illegally ending a $7 billion program that lowers energy costs and pollution by bringing solar energy to more than 900,000 households in low-income and disadvantaged communities across the country.

Washington and 23 other grant recipients also filed suit yesterday in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims to recover damages for EPA’s unlawful breach of the grant agreements that were executed under this program.

Congress created the Solar for All program in 2022 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, directing EPA to make competitive grants to states and other entities to deploy solar projects in low-income and disadvantaged areas. EPA selected recipients and awarded all of the program funds to plaintiff states and other grant recipients by August 2024. Washington and the other plaintiffs moved forward with planning projects and working with stakeholders to develop their solar programs.

But EPA abruptly and unlawfully terminated the program two months ago and clawed back the vast majority of the money already awarded. That has left Washington and the other plaintiffs without access to the funds to proceed with their solar programs. In Washington, for example, EPA’s illegal move jeopardizes $156 million for qualifying solar projects in the state. The Washington State Department of Commerce invested more than 5,000 employee hours in developing Solar for All programming and was hoping to launch its programming in late 2025 or early 2026. Now, the Department of Commerce has no path forward.

“The administration is again targeting people struggling to get by in America, this time by gutting programs that help low-income households afford electricity,” Washington State Attorney General Nick Brown said. “Congress passed a solar energy program to help make electricity costs more affordable, but the administration is ignoring the law and focused on the conspiracy theory that climate change is a hoax.”

When President Trump took office this past January, he prioritized fossil fuel extraction to address an alleged “energy emergency” while arbitrarily excluding solar power as a resource that can be tapped to meet the country’s energy needs. In July, Congress passed the president’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” rescinding funds for the Solar for All program that were unobligated as of July 3. The effect of that move was small, given that EPA had obligated all of the $7 billion for the program nearly a year earlier.

But instead of following that newly passed law, EPA and Zeldin illegally terminated the program on August 7. On social media, Zeldin made baseless accusations, calling Solar for All a “boondoggle.” The agency then sent memos to all recipients, including the plaintiffs, saying EPA no longer has a “statutory basis or dedicated funding” for the program, even though Congress never directed EPA to cancel funds that had already been awarded. In fact, Congress did the opposite by only rescinding unobligated funds for Solar for All.

Washington and a multistate coalition are filing a lawsuit today in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, alleging, among other things, that the EPA violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the U.S. Constitution’s Separation of Powers Doctrine in unlawfully canceling the program.

Brown and the attorneys general of Arizona and Minnesota are leading the complaint, which was joined by the attorneys general of California, Colorado, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Hawaiʻi, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Vermont. Also joining the complaint are the governors of Kentucky and Pennsylvania, as well as the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation.

Separately, Washington joined a lawsuit that was filed yesterday in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. In that complaint, the states and other entities argue the EPA breached the clear terms of the agreements and violated the duty of good faith and fair dealing in canceling their Solar for All grants. They’re asking the court to award the plaintiffs money damages, interest, and fees.

The attorneys general of Maryland and Arizona are leading the complaint, which was also joined by the attorneys general in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaiʻi, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and the District of Columbia.

CHICAGO, IL / ACCESS Newswire / October 16, 2025 / Authored by Baker Tilly's Gideon Gradman, Michelle Isenhouer Hanlin, Shristhi Negi, Valerie Nubbe

Explore how the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) reshapes IRA tax credit access and accelerates the timeline for action for your campus.

As higher education institutions across the country continue to grapple with aging infrastructure and sustainability commitments, the energy incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) have been a vital tool in making clean energy projects financially feasible. By reducing upfront costs for solar, battery storage, central utility plants and other clean energy technologies, the IRA has helped institutions improve infrastructure resiliency and advance sustainability goals while preserving capital. The IRA made sure these benefits were accessible to tax-exempt institutions through the direct pay provision of the law, allowing not-for-profits to receive the Investment Tax Credits and/or Production Tax Credits (ITC/PTC) as a refundable cash payment not previously available to tax-exempt organizations, a game changer for higher education.

What is the One Big Beautiful Bill Act?

On July 4, 2025, President Trump signed the sweeping tax reform and spending reconciliation bill known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) into law. While the legislation addresses a broad range of issues, it notably revises several energy tax incentives introduced under the IRA. As one of the most consequential amendments to the IRA, future credit claimants have been busy trying to understand how these statutory changes interact with existing guidance.

The OBBBA preserves the direct pay option, ensuring that colleges and universities can still access clean energy incentives directly. However, it also accelerates the phase-out of certain tax credit funding provisions for clean energy power generation projects, narrowing the window for higher education institutions to benefit. Institutions can still take advantage of funding opportunities for projects like solar energy and geothermal energy installations, but timing is critical. Those institutions with projects underway should move quickly, while others may need to identify new clean energy projects this year if they want to utilize their benefits.

Furthermore, the legislation narrows access to certain benefits by imposing more restrictive rules on involvement with foreign entities of concern, setting new qualification deadlines and gradually phasing out select provisions. Many clean energy incentives remain in place, but with more limited windows of opportunity and stricter compliance standards. As a result, the urgency for educational institutions to start is great than ever.

How does the OBBBA affect higher education energy projects?

Solar

The Commercial Solar ITC under IRC Section 48E imposes a tighter construction window: schools must break ground by July 4, 2026, or bring systems online by Dec. 31, 2027, to secure funding. Fortunately, opportunities remain, but you need to get started to secure the solar tax credit funding.

Energy storage

A bright spot for institutions is in energy storage, an area that remains favorably treated under the OBBBA. The full ITC is still available for standalone battery storage systems through 2033, giving institutions ample time to plan campus-scale installations with robust federal backing. Even as solar incentives phase out, pairing energy storage with leased or safe-harbored solar systems may help offset cost impacts and sustain long-term sustainability goals.

Fuel cells and linear generators

Fuel cells, including linear generators offer a compelling opportunity under OBBBA as the incentives are built to last. Eligible fuel cell and linear generator systems that generate electricity now qualify for a base 30% ITC, offering a new option for distributed generation on campus with heat recovery where needed. Unlike solar and wind technologies facing early sunsets, fuel cells and linear generator projects remain federally supported if projects begin construction after Dec. 31, 2025, through the end of 2035.

Electric vehicles (EVs) and EV chargers

Colleges and universities considering alternative fuel vehicles to add to their fleet must move swiftly. Federal credits including the Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit (45W) and EV incentives (30D and 25E) expire after Sept. 30, 2025, while refueling infrastructure support under Section 30c ends by June 30, 2026.

Incentives in action: Our work on campuses

Baker Tilly has worked with numerous colleges and universities over the past few years, helping them take advantage of clean energy incentives for campus projects. Our energy and infrastructure team has helped these institutions understand their eligibility for clean energy tax credit funding and comply with myriad requirements needed to earn and keep these credits. This includes compliance with the prevailing wage and apprenticeship bonus credits (PW&A) requirements, domestic content bonus credit requirements and energy community bonus credit compliance requirements. Baker Tilly also helps guide institutions through the direct pay election process, allowing them to monetize tax credits as tax-exempt organizations. Our team also performs energy feasibility studies and cost segregation analyses to determine eligible property costs and optimize credit values. For example:

Baker Tilly is engaged with a major private university in the Northeast to secure federal clean energy tax credits for over $1 billion in energy initiatives, including geothermal and solar projects. Their planned solar installation generates approximately 1.9 megawatt-hours annually, covering around 17% of a key campus building's energy needs. Their campus-wide geothermal heating and cooling project will deliver ground-source thermal energy to meet more than half of the heating and cooling requirements for current and future buildings for a portion of the campus. These efforts support the university's sustainability and climate goals while enhancing energy infrastructure and reducing emissions by over 15%.

Baker Tilly is helping a private college in the Midwest to secure federal clean energy tax credits for a roughly $7 million thermal energy storage initiative. The project involves installing a thermal storage tank to shift electricity usage from daytime to nighttime, which helps reduce costs and lower demand charges by balancing energy consumption. Baker Tilly is supporting the college through the pre-construction phase by evaluating eligibility and ensuring compliance with tax credit requirements. The team will continue assisting through commissioning to help maximize and substantiate the credit, including adherence to PW&A standards for final tax filings.

Act now! What should your institution do next?

The maximum award amount will be $150 million per eligible applicant, with no minimum award amount, and it can award up to 25% of a project’s total capital investment.

When reviewing applications, NJEDA will consider the number of new jobs created (minimum 20), where the jobs are primarily located (80% in-state), and prevailing wage requirements. Successful projects will have a contractual agreement with at least one NJ-based partner investing at least $10 million at an eligible participant facility. Examples include a public/private college or high school, workforce development organization, vocational/technical school, labor organization, employer association, or nonprofit that provides training/apprenticeships.

NJEDA opened applications last week on September 25th, and applications will remain open until the funds are fully committed. Priority industries include:

Energy/clean energy: components for offshore wind, energy storage, and electrification equipment that can help companies in the energy supply chain locate or scale in New Jersey.

Construction and equipment manufacturers: large projects requiring significant capital investment and construction activity, such as new facilities and expansions, will generate demand for construction trades, materials suppliers, and equipment manufacturers.

Agriculture: although the program excludes primary agriculture operations, non-retail food and beverage manufacturers are eligible. These investments will strengthen the local agricultural processing and supply chains, increasing demand for processing and production equipment.

NJEDA is accepting applications through its main portal (www.njeda.gov/nextnjai/), and applicants are encouraged to complete required forms and submit the documentation listed with a detailed capital budget, job projections, wage schedules, evidence of the required collaborative relationship, environmental and labor compliance documentation, and a project timeline. The link provided above also includes a sample packet that can be used to help streamline and clarify the process.

The company will invest more than $23.7 million to expand its Kinston dishwasher production facility and Manufacturing Center of Excellence for dish production in North America.
“I am pleased that Electrolux chose to expand its operation in eastern North Carolina – the second job announcement for Lenoir County this week,” said Governor Josh Stein.
A performance-based grant of $200,000 from the One North Carolina Fund will help the company’s expansion in North Carolina.
“We are delighted to welcome Electrolux and the additional jobs and investment it brings to Lenoir County,” said Senator Bob Brinson.","Today Governor Josh Stein announced household appliance company Electrolux Consumer Products, Inc., will add 74 new jobs in Lenoir County. The company will invest more than $23.7 million to expand its Kinston dishwasher production facility and Manufacturing Center of Excellence for dish production in North America.

“I am pleased that Electrolux chose to expand its operation in eastern North Carolina – the second job announcement for Lenoir County this week,” said Governor Josh Stein. “Our state is a great place to do business thanks to our highly skilled manufacturing workforce and the business-friendly climate we have cultivated. I look forward to watching the company continue to grow and thrive in Kinston.”

Electrolux is a globally recognized appliance company that has produced household products for more than 100 years. The Kinston location opened in 1989, manufacturing plastic tub dishwashers for the company’s North American market. This expansion will add 30,000 square feet to its existing footprint to manufacture stainless steel tub dishwashers in the United States.

“This expansion is a testament to our commitment to U.S. manufacturing and our belief in the strength of the Kinston workforce,” said Ricardo Cons, president and CEO of Business Area North America for Electrolux Group. “We’re proud to continue investing in a community that has supported us for more than three decades, and to do so in North Carolina - a state with a pro-business climate that prioritizes and champions manufacturing.”

“Companies already operating in our state are some of the best recruiters,” said Commerce Secretary Lee Lilley. “When innovative manufacturers like Electrolux reinvest in North Carolina, it’s a powerful signal that our state is indeed the best place to do business in America because we are home to the largest manufacturing workforce in the Southeast, strong manufacturing partnerships, and a robust transportation system to help them get products to market faster.”

While wages for assemblers, handlers, machine operators, technicians, and engineers vary, the annual average salary for the new positions will be $48,807, which exceeds the Lenoir County average of $48,683. These new jobs could potentially create an annual payroll impact of more than $3.6 million for the region.

A performance-based grant of $200,000 from the One North Carolina Fund will help the company’s expansion in North Carolina. The OneNC Fund provides financial assistance to local governments to help attract economic investment and to create jobs. Companies receive no money upfront and must meet job creation and capital investment targets to qualify for payment. All OneNC grants require matching participation from local governments, and any award is contingent upon that condition being met.

“We are delighted to welcome Electrolux and the additional jobs and investment it brings to Lenoir County,” said Senator Bob Brinson. “Eastern North Carolina has always provided growing companies with a great business environment, an excellent quality of life, a diligent labor pool, and a partnership as a member of our community.”

“This is outstanding news for Kinston, Lenoir County, and the entire state,” said Representative Chris Humphrey. “Electrolux has been a phenomenal corporate citizen for more than three decades, and we’re grateful to the economic development professionals as well as the state and local officials who helped them make their decision to expand here.”

In addition to the North Carolina Department of Commerce and the Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina, other key partners in this project include the North Carolina General Assembly, North Carolina Community College System, Lenoir Community College, North Carolina’s Southeast, North Carolina Global TransPark Economic Development Region, Lenoir County, and Lenoir County Development Alliance.",,N,,2025-10-16 11:16:05.062488

The John Locke Foundation has proposed a working group to examine the guest worker visa program and identify areas for improvement.

H2A workers place a significant burden on small to mid-sized farmers, who must shoulder the costs of housing and transporting guest workers, in addition to paying their wages, according to “Harvest on Hold,” a report out earlier this year by Kelly Lester, policy analyst for the John Locke Foundation.

“As the availability of farm labor has declined, wages have increased in response to the dynamics of supply and demand, while some argue this is a natural market correction, others point out that wage increases in agriculture often do not translate to long-term solutions,” said the report. “Many small and mid-sized farms operate on tight margins and cannot easily absorb high labor costs without raising prices or reducing their workforce.”

The proposed working group would consist of 13 members, including representatives from the US Department of Agriculture, Department of Commerce, and Department of Labor; representatives from the Farm Bureau and Growers Association; state lawmakers and owners of small to mid-sized farms; labor contractors, academics, and nonprofit reps serving immigrant and seasonal workers.

“The H-2A visa program is critical to North Carolina agriculture, but it’s overly complicated, expensive, and slow to adapt to modern farm realities,” Lester, who authored the proposal, told the Carolina Journal. “Right now, farmers face layers of bureaucracy that drive up costs and make it harder to bring in workers when they’re actually needed. While the federal government has started discussing some reforms to the program, it is vital for North Carolina to have a voice. By creating a working group focused on real-world reforms — like streamlining applications, cutting compliance delays, and making the program more flexible for year-round operations — we can help farmers lower their input costs in a time when it is desperately expensive to operate a farm.”

The purpose of the working group would be to examine how the program currently operates within North Carolina, identify areas for improvement, and determine the best practices being implemented in neighboring states. Based on these examinations, the group would develop recommendations for policymakers at the federal level, including streamlining the application process, adjusting housing and wage requirements, and increasing flexibility for farms that need laborers on a year-round basis.",https://www.carolinajournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/47075383914_5292d4a061_k.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 13:04:59.833543

Summary

Between January and September 2025, companies announced over $1.2 trillion in investments towards building out U.S. production capacity – led by electronics, pharmaceuticals, and semiconductors.

The increase in planned U.S. production investments could lead to another period of accelerated construction manufacturing spending.

Building out U.S. manufacturing capacity across industries will likely create significant opportunities for U.S. infrastructure developers, as the construction and operation of large-scale manufacturing facilities requires significant materials, labor, and power.

The United States is experiencing a manufacturing resurgence, facilitated by a changing federal policy landscape and a shift to companies prioritizing supply chain resilience. Over the first eight months of the second Trump Administration, companies announced over $1.2

Stephanie Valdez Streaty, Cox director of industry insights, said in a report EVs could account for one quarter of all new U.S. car sales by 2030.
The company captured 15% of EV sales in the quarter, led by its new Chevrolet Equinox, the third best-selling battery-powered machine.
In the current quarter, S&P Global expects EVs to comprise less than 7% of new car sales.
BloombergNEF expects at least nine new electric cars and trucks priced below $40,000 in the next three years.","Americans bought 438,500 electric cars and trucks in the third quarter, as drivers raced to grab federal incentives before they expired Sept. 30.

Those transactions, the highest number in a single quarter, comprised 11% of all new car sales, eclipsing the previous high point of 8.7%, according to Cox Automotive, a services and technology company.

A crowd of more affordable cars next year could help maintain the momentum, but analysts expect EV transactions to dip in the months ahead without federal tax credits.

Stephanie Valdez Streaty, Cox director of industry insights, said in a report EVs could account for one quarter of all new U.S. car sales by 2030. That’s “well short of the 50% once envisioned, but certainly moving out of the ‘niche’ category.”

The sales tally underscores a tricky dynamic for auto executives and clean-air advocates: Millions of Americans want electric vehicles, but relatively high prices remain a speed bump to adoption.

Tesla Inc. still dominates the U.S. market for EVs and managed a small sales gain in the recent quarter after months of skidding results. However, a crowd of rivals is closing the gap quickly, shrinking Tesla’s share of the EV pie to 41% from 80% four years ago.

General Motors Co., in particular, is gaining electric speed. The company captured 15% of EV sales in the quarter, led by its new Chevrolet Equinox, the third best-selling battery-powered machine. That’s up from 10% in the year-earlier period.

Nearly half of U.S. EV purchases in the first half of the year were made without any federal incentive, according to BloombergNEF. And there are now at least 11 EVs in the United States with starting prices below that of the average car purchase. Chevrolet’s Equinox can be had for about $35,000, for example, and the brand just released a new version of its Bolt with a price tag of $29,000.

Emily Almaer, a mother of three in Boulder, Colo, is paying $250 a month for the Volkswagen ID.4 she picked up in August. At least three of her friends also recently ponied up for EVs: another Volkswagen, a Nissan Leaf and a Hyundai Ioniq 9.

“You look at some of these (monthly payments),” her husband, Dion Almaer, said, “and it’s like ‘Wait, this is like one family meal out.’”

The road ahead for EVs, however, looks rocky, at least for a little while. Without federal credits, BloombergNEF forecasts 27% of the U.S. market will be electric by 2030, down from the 48% share it estimated a year ago. In the current quarter, S&P Global expects EVs to comprise less than 7% of new car sales.

“The affordability issue is going to be exacerbated,” said Peter Nagle, an associate director at S&P. “It’s really going to be a sink or swim moment.”

Meanwhile, the market for used EVs is booming and more affordable EV models are heading to production. BloombergNEF expects at least nine new electric cars and trucks priced below $40,000 in the next three years.

Volvo Car AB Chief Executive Officer and President Hakan Samuelsson said his company will take a “huge step” next year in offering EVs with longer driving ranges and lower prices.

“The industry will be electric — there’s no turning back,” he told Bloomberg recently. “It may take a bit longer in some regions, but the direction is clear.”","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/16/PDTN/86723815007-uscarsbg-y-5-tmpp-7-thzaktcp-3-lht-7-laxici.jpg?crop=3995,2249,x0,y204&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-10-16 11:15:40.869042

“This is one of the most forward-thinking site development models in the country,” said LED Chief Economic Competitiveness Officer Ileana Ledet. “FastSites aligns government efficiency with private-sector speed, ensuring Louisiana can meet the demands of global investment while strengthening our communities and infrastructure.”

FastSites is built around a new model of velocity and accountability. Projects must demonstrate measurable returns, leverage private capital, and begin construction activities within nine months. Funding can be structured as forgivable loans, performance-based partnerships, or infrastructure investments, allowing the state to adapt to each project’s strategic potential.

Through targeted investment in infrastructure such as roads, utilities, and rail, FastSites transforms land into high-performance economic platforms, ready for immediate investment and scalable growth.

The application period for the inaugural round of funding opens October 30 and closes December 15. FastSites is open to public entities such as economic development organizations, municipalities, redevelopment authorities and political subdivisions. Privately owned sites may also qualify if they meet additional requirements designed to promote strong local investment and sustained growth.

To help potential applicants learn more about the program and application process, LED will host a webinar on Monday, October 27, at 2:00 p.m. Registration is available in advance here. After registering, attendees will receive a confirmation email with details about joining the meeting.

For many of our reshoring manufacturers, especially those racing to meet incentive deadlines or counter competitors, it’s a trade worth making.
In an era when speed and flexibility rival cost of capital in importance, private credit may well become the financial engine behind America’s manufacturing resurgence.","Key Takeaways

Private credit is emerging as a key reshoring enabler, offering manufacturers faster and more flexible access to capital than traditional syndicated loans—critical for meeting government incentive deadlines and outpacing competitors.

Flexibility and customization are major advantages, as private lenders can tailor repayment structures, drawdowns, and equity participation to match the long timelines and capital intensity of reshoring projects.

The trade-off comes with higher costs and tighter oversight, but for manufacturers prioritizing speed, adaptability, and strategic execution, private credit often justifies the premium as a catalyst for U.S. manufacturing growth.

The push to return manufacturing to U.S. shores, driven by fragile supply chains, shifting geopolitics, and ambitious domestic industrial policy, has shifted from boardroom talk to a surge of reshoring projects. From precision components to semiconductors, plants are breaking ground at a pace not seen in decades. But amid the strategy lies a pressing question: how to finance construction, workforce development, and other reshoring operations quickly and flexibly enough to seize the moment.

While syndicated loans remain a staple for large-scale borrowers, private creditis emerging as a decisive enabler for reshoring. Once a niche alternative, it has grown into an over $1.5 trillion global market with clear benefits for manufacturers of all sizes seeking financing options that align with the particular financing needs of reshoring.

Why Private Credit Fits the Reshoring Agenda

Speed and certainty are the most immediate advantages. Manufacturing development is often tied to government incentives—such as the CHIPS and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act, and state subsidy programs—which can impose strict timelines or otherwise be subject to phase-outs and volatile political headwinds. Private credit can close in weeks as opposed to months for a syndicated process. That can determine whether a grant is secured or lost—or whether a manufacturer can outrace its competitors competing for specialized domestic workforces, favorable new supply chains, and government contracts prioritizing domestic production.

Structural flexibility is equally vital. Reshoring projects often require heavy upfront investment, years before steady cash flow. Private lenders can tailor repayment to project realities, such as milestone-based drawdowns, long interest-only periods, or cash sweeps post‑production ramp-up, in contrast to the more rigid amortization and covenant demands common in syndicated loans. Furthermore, while prospective borrowers should carefully consider the costs and benefits of such approaches, private lenders are often more receptive partners to creative equity structures as a portion of their anticipated return on financing transactions than traditional bank lenders.

Specialized risks also make private credit attractive. Projects may involve advanced robotics, energy‑intensive methods, or other niche exposures and regulatory risks that traditional lenders may approach with skepticism. Private credit funds often field sector-focused teams capable of underwriting such risks without imposing prohibitive equity demands or overly restrictive covenants.

The Trade-offs: Cost, Liquidity, and Governance

Private credit is not cheap. Higher interest rates and fees, and the possible addition of equity compensation for the lender, reflect the lender’s concentrated risk and bespoke structuring. Borrowers must weigh whether the premium is justified by, among other things, speed and flexibility.

Liquidity is another consideration. Private loans are not broadly tradable; refinancing can be difficult, particularly when options were not plentiful to begin with or when a project encounters delays, increased costs, or other obstacles to profitability. If market conditions or project economics change, this lack of optionality can be constraining.

The close relationships that make private credit adaptable can also bring potentially intrusive governance. Enhanced reporting, board observer rights, and other operational oversight are common. Some management teams value the dialogue; others may resist the visibility granted to lenders.

Strategic Financing in a Strategic Moment

For manufacturers looking to reshore, capital constraints, bureaucracy, and inflexible financing can derail projects with long‑term strategic value for their businesses and the U.S. industrial base. Private credit can sidestep these obstacles by offering rapid, customized capital focused on the particular business, and execution of the particular reshoring project rather than market convention.

The trade-off is clear: higher costs in exchange for faster, more flexible capital. For many of our reshoring manufacturers, especially those racing to meet incentive deadlines or counter competitors, it’s a trade worth making. In an era when speed and flexibility rival cost of capital in importance, private credit may well become the financial engine behind America’s manufacturing resurgence.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.14205_3939.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 11:15:55.573022

2023), rejected the EPA's application of the Reactivation Policy to require the owners of an inactive refinery to obtain an NSR permit before restarting the operations of the refinery.
The Third Circuit reasoned that the CAA ""unambiguously limits"" the application of the NSR program to ""newly constructed or modified facilities,"" and that the EPA's Reactivation Policy extends the NSR program ""beyond those limited circumstances.""
Accordingly, ""EPA will no longer apply the Reactivation Policy to classify resuming operation of a stationary source as construction of a new source in EPA permitting and enforcement actions on a national basis.""
The recission of the Reactivation Policy is the latest in a series of EPA actions reforming the NSR program, following closely after the agency's new interpretation of ""Begin Actual Construction"" and reinstatement of its ""no second-guessing"" policy.","On September 18, 2025, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced a nationwide recission of its ""Reactivation Policy,"" which it had historically applied to determine whether a New Source Review (NSR) permit was required in order to resume the operation of an idle stationary source.

The Clean Air Act's (CAA) NSR provisions require the owner or operator of a facility to obtain a permit before constructing a new major stationary source or making a major modification at an existing major stationary source. Under the Reactivation Policy, EPA maintained that resuming operation of an idle facility that was determined to be ""permanently shut down"" constitutes the construction of a new stationary source, thereby triggering the requirement to obtain an NSR permit. EPA considered the intention of the owner or operator at the time of shutdown when determining whether the shutdown should be treated as permanent, examining factors such as the reason for the shutdown and the cost and time to reactivate the facility, among others. Additionally, EPA presumed that a major stationary source that was idle for two or more years was permanently shut down.

However, on July 25, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Port Hamilton Refining and Transportation, LLLP v. U.S. EPA, 87 F. 4th 188 (3d Cir. 2023), rejected the EPA's application of the Reactivation Policy to require the owners of an inactive refinery to obtain an NSR permit before restarting the operations of the refinery. The Third Circuit reasoned that the CAA ""unambiguously limits"" the application of the NSR program to ""newly constructed or modified facilities,"" and that the EPA's Reactivation Policy extends the NSR program ""beyond those limited circumstances.""

EPA relies on this Third Circuit decision in justifying its recission of the Reactivation Policy, stating that although the ""Third Circuit did not vacate the Reactivation Policy itself, the court's reasoning leads to the inescapable conclusion that it is not permissible for EPA to apply that policy to require existing stationary sources to obtain a permit based solely on resuming operation of the source after a period of inactivity."" Accordingly, ""EPA will no longer apply the Reactivation Policy to classify resuming operation of a stationary source as construction of a new source in EPA permitting and enforcement actions on a national basis."" However, EPA stresses that it will continue to enforce the NSR applicability provisions relating to the modification of existing facilities in accordance with the CAA. That is, the ""restart of an idled facility involving a physical change (or a change in the method of operation at the source other than simply restarting) will still require [an NSR] permit if it qualifies as a 'major modification' by virtue of the nature of the change and the degree to which it results in an increase in regulated NSR pollutant emissions.""

The recission of the Reactivation Policy is the latest in a series of EPA actions reforming the NSR program, following closely after the agency's new interpretation of ""Begin Actual Construction"" and reinstatement of its ""no second-guessing"" policy. These recent changes mark a significant shift in EPA's application of the NSR program, and industry stakeholders should be on the lookout for more updates in this area.

State of play: The project will upgrade lines in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, and West Virginia, per AEP and DOE.
AEP claimed that financing at a ""preferred interest rate"" will save its customers roughly $275 million over the life of the loan.
""This one started under the Biden administration, but it's a good project,"" Wright told reporters.
What's next: ""Approximately 100 miles of transmission lines across Ohio and Oklahoma are the first projects to be supported by the loan guarantee,"" AEP said.","The Energy Department just finalized a $1.6 billion loan guarantee for American Electric Power to optimize and rebuild around 5,000 miles of transmission lines across five states.

Why it matters: Getting new interstate lines approved is really hard even as power demand rises, and grid analysts see lots of potential in boosting capacity along existing infrastructure and corridors.

State of play: The project will upgrade lines in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, and West Virginia, per AEP and DOE.

The financing will support the replacement of lines in existing rights-of-way with new lines that can transmit more power, the company said.

AEP claimed that financing at a ""preferred interest rate"" will save its customers roughly $275 million over the life of the loan.

""This loan guarantee will not only help modernize the grid and expand transmission capacity but will help position the United States to win the AI race and grow our manufacturing base,"" Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement.

The intrigue: Republicans once assailed loan guarantees (see Solyndra) but have come to embrace them for preferred projects.

DOE, in Thursday's announcement, credited changes to the program in the GOP budget law.

Flashback: The Biden administration announced the conditional commitment of this loan just days before President Trump took office earlier this year.

""This one started under the Biden administration, but it's a good project,"" Wright told reporters. ""Not all of them are nonsense.""

Zoom in: Wright compared this project to another loan guarantee the department canceled for what would have been for a wholly new power line — Invenergy's Grain Belt Express — connecting renewable energy in the Great Plains to other parts of the country.

Wright said it was a lot more expensive (because it was a new power line) and was capitalizing on an ""arbitrage"" of stranded renewable energy.

""Most private energy development is funded by private capital, as it should be,"" Wright said. ""We're looking for those cases where bringing in government capital is necessary.""

What's next: ""Approximately 100 miles of transmission lines across Ohio and Oklahoma are the first projects to be supported by the loan guarantee,"" AEP said.

Court dismisses suit against EPA

A federal court has dismissed a lawsuit brought by farmers who claimed the Environmental Protection Agency failed to regulate per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, known as ""forever chemicals.""

The plaintiffs have a 60-day window to appeal the decision, which was handed down Sept. 29. The plaintiffs included farmers from Johnson County, Texas; Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association; and Potomac Riverkeeper Inc., according to a news release from the University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture.

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, refer to a large family of chemicals that break down very slowly, earning their moniker ""forever chemicals."" PFAS became widespread in the mid-20th century due to their water- and grease-resistant properties. They have been used in a variety of consumer products from cookware to food packaging and fire extinguishing foam.

In the last few decades, research has linked PFAS with several health risks including developmental delays in children and cancer. Because PFAS takes such a long time to break down and were so widely used, they can be present in water, soil, air and food.

""Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that EPA had failed to perform its mandatory Clean Water Act or CWA, duty to identify and regulate at least 18 distinct PFAS pollutants in the sewage sludge that plaintiffs and others use as fertilizer on their farming operations,"" said Brigit Rollins, attorney with the National Agricultural Law Center. ""Additionally, the plaintiffs claimed that EPA failed to adopt regulations that provide restrictions on additional PFAS pollutants that the agency had previously identified.

""However, a federal court has disagreed, finding that the EPA did not violate its CWA duties,"" Rollins said. ""While the court ultimately dismissed the case, it did indicate what future actions the plaintiffs might take to prompt EPA to adopt stricter PFAS regulations.""

In its 10-page decision, the court explained that the EPA had not violated the Clean Water Act either by failing to identify the pollutants in its most recent biennial sewage sludge report or by failing to adopt regulations to manage the pollutants it has already identified as present in sewage sludge known as biosolids.

The court said that the plain language of the act requires the EPA to review its existing sewage sludge regulations every two years in order to ""facilitate the subsequent identification and regulation of pollutants,"" Rollins said. For that reason, the court found that the EPA had not violated the act by failing to identify the 18 PFAS pollutants in its most recent biennial report.

""The court dismissed the case without prejudice, leaving open the possibility that the plaintiffs could refile the claims on a later date,"" she said. ""Additionally, the court suggested other avenues that the plaintiffs could pursue to prompt EPA to more strictly regulate PFAS.""",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/static-4/teaser_images/www.pbcommercial.com_default.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 11:15:32.456725

But there’s still a risk that action to curb climate change will remain the scapegoat, even as its consequences have long since arrived.","“It’s an issue that I think we need to continue to engage on and speak out on and work to legislate on, but it’s not a top three issue right now,” Sen. Chris Coons, the Democratic co-chair of the Senate’s bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus, told me.

In a recent op-ed, Coons pinned Delaware’s rising electricity costs on Trump — and didn’t mention climate once.

Indeed, party leaders are trying a two-pronged affordability-centered strategy: tying higher electricity bills nationwide to Republicans’ dismantling of their signature climate package, while also downplaying climate policies within the states Democrats do control.

Coons, one of former President Joe Biden’s closest allies, added, “Let’s put it this way: American voters clearly didn’t give the Biden-Harris administration and Democrats the credit we hoped they would for transformational investments in energy, and that sent a signal to Trump that he could reverse, defund or cut lots of investments in new energy generation, grid stability, energy research, new energy sources for the United States.”

In other words: While climate legislation didn’t lose Democrats the election, it didn’t not lose it, either.

Sen. Brian Schatz, perhaps the Democrats’ most articulate orator on climate right now, is also preaching a message of affordability.

“The way to victory is to talk about price,” the Hawaii Democrat said at a New York Times event last month. “You could talk about the planetary emergency and mitigation and adaptation, and you could throw in some environmental justice rhetoric, and by the time you’re done talking, people think you don’t care about them.”

There will be plenty of opportunities to test out messaging. Electricity prices are projected to continue climbing, partly on the back of more and more AI data centers but partly on utilities’ increased spending to upgrade aging grid infrastructure.

It’s also notable that electricity tends to be cheaper in states with higher-than-average concentrations of wind and solar power, as my POLITICO colleagues Zack Colman and Catherine Allen reported. And Republicans’ repeal of much of the Inflation Reduction Act’s tax credits for renewable energy are estimated to raise electricity rates by 5-7 percent by 2030, according to the think tank Resources for the Future.

Democrats are already getting some wins under the affordability banner. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, a potential White House contender, signed a package of energy bills in May, including to speed up solar permitting, all while touting the ability to curb utility costs.

Sometimes climate can even slip in alongside affordability, as in a legislative package that California Gov. Gavin Newsom, another likely 2028 aspirant, signed last month at a podium emblazoned with “Cutting utility bills. Cutting pollution.”

“This is not an ideological endeavor,” Newsom said in signing the bills, which extend the state’s carbon-trading program and direct some of its proceeds to electricity bill rebates while also easing permitting for new oil wells. State Republicans voted for that part, but some also voted for another part that broadens the state’s electric grid to make it easier to trade power across state lines.

“We’re in the practical application business,” Newsom said. “We’ve got to manifest our ideals and our goals. And so this lays it out, but it lays it out without laying tracks over folks.”

California environmentalists say it’s an example of how to keep talking about climate change, particularly in the current political climate.

“Our position has always been that addressing climate change is the cost-effective path forward,” said Victoria Rome, director of California government affairs for the Natural Resources Defense Council. “I don’t think the answer is to stop talking about it. I think the answer is to show people how the solutions are actually good for them, for their health, for their pocketbook.”

No affordability discourse these days is complete without a discussion of power prices in the mid-Atlantic, which have risen by as much as 35 percent since last year and are feeding into New Jersey’s tight gubernatorial race.

The obscurity of the actual culprit — the regional electric grid operator’s lack of urgency in connecting new energy projects — is letting both candidates get in their hits, as POLITICO E&E News’ Adam Aton and Timothy Cama note. Energy policy may not have decided the presidential election, but it could determine the next governor of New Jersey.

Republican Jack Ciattarelli is blaming outgoing Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy for closing power plants, and he’s proposing to pull the state out of a regional carbon-trading program; Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill is blaming Trump and pledging to freeze utility rates and reform the regional grid operator. But she’s also engaged in some self-flagellating.

“Sometimes our messaging in the Democratic Party — not great,” Sherrill said in a March interview. “For years we’ve said, ‘We need to move into clean power.’ And there’s almost been this understanding, ‘It’s going to cost you an arm and a leg, but if you’re a good person, you’ll do it.’ So now that we’re actually in that place that we promised — it was going to be cheaper than any other source of power — people are skeptical.”

Ciattarelli weaponized that “arm and a leg” excerpt last month in ads that took Sherrill’s statement out of context.

Slightly removed from the heat of the campaign, there’s actually bipartisan agreement that the grid operator needs fixing. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Democrat and Republican, respectively, who both might be eyeing 2028, are both threatening to pull their states out of the organization that currently operates their electric grid.

But there’s still a risk that action to curb climate change will remain the scapegoat, even as its consequences have long since arrived.

David Hill, executive vice president of the energy program at the Bipartisan Policy Center, noted that when electricity supplies were ample, there was less of a need to focus on reliability and affordability when talking climate. Now, those are the public’s key concerns and so climate advocates are facing “some pretty severe pushback,” even as there’s only so much they can do.

“In the end,” Hill said, “power flows according to the laws of physics, not according to the laws of politics or economics.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F89%2Fbc%2F67a52c8945689e2113cf9c81d890%2Fbiden-renewable-energy-transmission-68233.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 11:14:34.946740

The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) grid saw 7.6GW of new utility-scale PV capacity in 2024, followed by the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) grid (6GW) and the non-ISO grids in the West and Southeast (largely Florida), both with 4.7GW of new utility-scale solar capacity.

The report provides a range of granular data on utility-scale PV deployments and the market at large.

Utility-scale solar costs

Berkeley Lab’s report showed that the average capacity-weighted cost of installed utility-scale solar rose fractionally from 2023 to 2024; from US$1.59/Wac to US$1.61/Wac. The “robust” 2024 data is based on records from 425 projects, which Berkeley said was 92% of new projects.

However, the cost of utility-scale PV varied significantly by region and grid. ERCOT saw the lowest prices, under US$1.5/Wac, while most other ISOs saw prices around the US$1.5/Wac mark. The outlier was the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO), which saw prices over US$2/Wac.

Berkeley Lab said this variation was due to land availability, prevailing labour rates and transmission network upgrade costs

The national average levelised cost of energy (LCOE) for utility-scale PV rose by 13% last year, from US$53/MWh to US$60/MWh without tax credits, and from US$36/MWh to US$41/MWh with Investment or Production tax credits. Higher financing costs, increasing capex and slightly lower estimated performance pushed the national average LCOE up, the report said.

Single-axis trackers dominate, c-Si grows

Almost all (99%) new utility-scale solar projects deployed single-axis trackers instead of fixed-tilt mounts last year. Just 12 projects deployed fixed-tilt racking in 2024, compared with 236 tracker-mounted installations.

The cost of tracker systems fell in 2024, which, combined with the tracker projects’ higher energy yield per installed capacity, made tracker systems far more attractive to project owners. Fixed-tilt systems are only now found in “challenging” environments, such as areas with extreme terrain or high risk of adverse weather.

Last year also saw a significant expansion in the deployment of c-Si solar technology at utility-scale. Annual c-Si solar capacity almost doubled in 2024, reaching 23.4GW compared with around 13.3GW in 2023.

By contrast, thin-film deployments remained fairly constant, rising by under 1GW from 5.24GW in 2023 to 6.13GW in 2024. This is likely because the US only has one major thin-film module producer, First Solar.

The US had 79.19GW of utility-scale c-Si solar capacity and 30.74GW of utility-scale thin-film capacity as of the end of 2024.

Corporate offtakers surge

Corporations were the biggest buyers of utility-scale solar power in the US last year, a first for the industry.

Corporate offtakers signed power purchase agreements (PPA) for 9.8GW of utility-scale solar power in 2024, representing 33% of all deals signed. Investor-owned utilities signed PPAs for 5.4GW, monopoly investor-owned utilities 5.2GW and public utilities 4.6GW.

This marks the first time that corporations have led the offtake figures, according to Berkeley Lab’s publicly available data, and 2024 also saw corporate PPA capacities more than double. Last year, corporate PPAs amounted to 4.7GW, trailing the 6GW agreed by investor-owned utilities.

The corporate solar PPA sector really kicked off in 2020, when annual deals rose from 684MW to over 2.2GW. Barring a slump in 2022 it rose gradually, by around 1GW a year, before jumping substantially in 2024.

Explore how the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) reshapes IRA tax credit access and accelerates the timeline for action for your campus.

As higher education institutions across the country continue to grapple with aging infrastructure and sustainability commitments, the energy incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) have been a vital tool in making clean energy projects financially feasible. By reducing upfront costs for solar, battery storage, central utility plants and other clean energy technologies, the IRA has helped institutions improve infrastructure resiliency and advance sustainability goals while preserving capital. The IRA made sure these benefits were accessible to tax-exempt institutions through the direct pay provision of the law, allowing not-for-profits to receive the Investment Tax Credits and/or Production Tax Credits (ITC/PTC) as a refundable cash payment not previously available to tax-exempt organizations, a game changer for higher education.

What is the One Big Beautiful Bill Act?

On July 4, 2025, President Trump signed the sweeping tax reform and spending reconciliation bill known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) into law. While the legislation addresses a broad range of issues, it notably revises several energy tax incentives introduced under the IRA. As one of the most consequential amendments to the IRA, future credit claimants have been busy trying to understand how these statutory changes interact with existing guidance.

The OBBBA preserves the direct pay option, ensuring that colleges and universities can still access clean energy incentives directly. However, it also accelerates the phase-out of certain tax credit funding provisions for clean energy power generation projects, narrowing the window for higher education institutions to benefit. Institutions can still take advantage of funding opportunities for projects like solar energy and geothermal energy installations, but timing is critical. Those institutions with projects underway should move quickly, while others may need to identify new clean energy projects this year if they want to utilize their benefits.

Furthermore, the legislation narrows access to certain benefits by imposing more restrictive rules on involvement with foreign entities of concern, setting new qualification deadlines and gradually phasing out select provisions. Many clean energy incentives remain in place, but with more limited windows of opportunity and stricter compliance standards. As a result, the urgency for educational institutions to start is great than ever.

How does the OBBBA affect higher education energy projects?

Solar

The Commercial Solar ITC under IRC Section 48E imposes a tighter construction window: schools must break ground by July 4, 2026, or bring systems online by Dec. 31, 2027, to secure funding. Fortunately, opportunities remain, but you need to get started to secure the solar tax credit funding.

Energy storage

A bright spot for institutions is in energy storage, an area that remains favorably treated under the OBBBA. The full ITC is still available for standalone battery storage systems through 2033, giving institutions ample time to plan campus-scale installations with robust federal backing. Even as solar incentives phase out, pairing energy storage with leased or safe-harbored solar systems may help offset cost impacts and sustain long-term sustainability goals.

Fuel cells and linear generators

Fuel cells, including linear generators offer a compelling opportunity under OBBBA as the incentives are built to last. Eligible fuel cell and linear generator systems that generate electricity now qualify for a base 30% ITC, offering a new option for distributed generation on campus with heat recovery where needed. Unlike solar and wind technologies facing early sunsets, fuel cells and linear generator projects remain federally supported if projects begin construction after Dec. 31, 2025, through the end of 2035.

Electric vehicles (EVs) and EV chargers

Colleges and universities considering alternative fuel vehicles to add to their fleet must move swiftly. Federal credits including the Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit (45W) and EV incentives (30D and 25E) expire after Sept. 30, 2025, while refueling infrastructure support under Section 30c ends by June 30, 2026.

Incentives in action: Our work on campuses

Baker Tilly has worked with numerous colleges and universities over the past few years, helping them take advantage of clean energy incentives for campus projects. Our energy and infrastructure team has helped these institutions understand their eligibility for clean energy tax credit funding and comply with myriad requirements needed to earn and keep these credits. This includes compliance with the prevailing wage and apprenticeship bonus credits (PW&A) requirements, domestic content bonus credit requirements and energy community bonus credit compliance requirements. Baker Tilly also helps guide institutions through the direct pay election process, allowing them to monetize tax credits as tax-exempt organizations. Our team also performs energy feasibility studies and cost segregation analyses to determine eligible property costs and optimize credit values. For example:

Baker Tilly is engaged with a major private university in the Northeast to secure federal clean energy tax credits for over $1 billion in energy initiatives, including geothermal and solar projects. Their planned solar installation generates approximately 1.9 megawatt-hours annually, covering around 17% of a key campus building's energy needs. Their campus-wide geothermal heating and cooling project will deliver ground-source thermal energy to meet more than half of the heating and cooling requirements for current and future buildings for a portion of the campus. These efforts support the university's sustainability and climate goals while enhancing energy infrastructure and reducing emissions by over 15%.

Baker Tilly is helping a private college in the Midwest to secure federal clean energy tax credits for a roughly $7 million thermal energy storage initiative. The project involves installing a thermal storage tank to shift electricity usage from daytime to nighttime, which helps reduce costs and lower demand charges by balancing energy consumption. Baker Tilly is supporting the college through the pre-construction phase by evaluating eligibility and ensuring compliance with tax credit requirements. The team will continue assisting through commissioning to help maximize and substantiate the credit, including adherence to PW&A standards for final tax filings.

Act now! What should your institution do next?

Assess your energy project pipeline

Identify capital projects that could qualify for OBBBA-related credits, grants or financing mechanisms

Update your facilities and finance teams on funding opportunities

Ensure that key internal teams are informed about the OBBBA provisions and prepared to act quickly as funding opportunities and compliance requirements emerge

Letting electric vehicles strategically charge from and discharge to the grid could spark environmental and public health benefits for Americans, according to a new study from the University of Michigan and Carnegie Mellon University.

For one, it could reduce greenhouse gas and other air emissions in a way that would more than offset what’s produced when charging EVs. In addition to mitigating climate change, this reduction in emissions would help alleviate some of the damaging health impacts and costs.

Furthermore, it could also help drivers sell stored energy to the grid and recoup some of their charging costs while incentivizing the construction of more renewable energy generators.

“These new installations would decarbonize not only EVs, but other parts of the whole power system,” said Jiahui Chen, a lead author of the new study and U-M doctoral student in environment and sustainability. “By adding EV flexible loads, you actually reduce emissions from the entire grid.”

The project was funded by U-M’s School for Environment and Sustainability, as well as Carnegie Mellon’s Department of Engineering and Public Policy and Department of Mechanical Engineering.

After solar panels and wind turbines are built, they provide nearly free energy without any greenhouse gas emissions. Unfortunately, nature doesn’t work on our schedules. Without robust storage solutions, the clean energy that’s made when the sun’s shining and the wind is blowing is wasted when its supply exceeds the demand.

Companies are starting to roll out new large-scale storage technologies to try and change that. But researchers have also realized a growing number of Americans could have another established solution sitting in their garages: electric vehicles. By strategically charging EVs and enabling them to send their stored energy at appropriate times to the grid, Americans could access more affordable energy with less emissions.

“You’d think if you’re buying more electricity, you’d be creating more emissions, but it turns out you can actually reverse it, if you charge your vehicle at the right time. We call it ‘negative vehicle emissions,'” said study senior co-author Jeremy Michalek, professor of mechanical engineering and of engineering and public policy at Carnegie Mellon.

Central to these gains are two intertwined ideas that aren’t brand new, but also aren’t yet widely implemented in the U.S. The first is this idea of charging at the right time, or smart charging, when the grid is flush with energy from renewable sources.

The second key component is what’s referred to as vehicle-to-grid, or V2G. With V2G, EV drivers could sell their stored clean energy to the grid when demand is high, instead of power plants needing to burn more fossil fuels to meet energy needs.

“There are times when wind and solar are generating so much power that it cannot be consumed and, sadly, we have to waste that,” Chen said. “We can use EVs to absorb that otherwise wasted very cheap, very clean energy. We can then use that energy at a later time, when it would cost more, and avoid burning fossil fuels to make it.”

The combination of smart charging and V2G would support a system that incentivizes the building of more renewable energy plants. Once they are built, these resources can inject clean energy into the grid whenever they produce it, because wind and sunshine are free while oil and gas are not.

“Once you have that wind and solar in place, it generates first. It displaces coal and natural gas even when EVs aren’t charging. It’s like the EVs trigger the building of these plants that then can run and displace fossil fuels all the time,” Michalek said. “This low carbon infrastructure can supply everybody else who uses electricity as well.”

The team is not the first to consider the ramifications of V2G and smart charging. But it is the first to model their impacts in a more comprehensive manner that accounts for their influence on the evolution of renewable energy in the country.

“We tend to think of these things as separate and static. For example, there’s a bunch of studies—including ones that I’ve done and Jeremy has done—that try to figure out whether electric vehicles cut emissions or not with a static grid,” said Parth Vaishnav, senior co-author of the study and U-M professor of environment and sustainability.

“But as things start electrifying and start interacting, it’s incomplete to answer questions about one system without accounting for how it might change how another system is built and operated.”

This modeling also used a fairly conservative outlook, Chen said. For example, it did not assume federal incentives, like the recently expired tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act for renewable energy. The researchers also considered scenarios that allowed for the deployment of large, stationary battery banks to store energy from the grid. While the details varied in those scenarios, the take-home messages remained the same, the authors said.

“EVs could still produce a lot of substantial benefits,” Chen said. “You could say there is an additive relationship.”

Michael Craig, U-M associate professor of environment and sustainability and of industrial and operations engineering, also contributed to the study, as did Matthew Bruchon, who worked on the project as a doctoral student at Carnegie Mellon.",https://news.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/mc-image-cache/2025/10/letting-evs-take-a-load-off-the-grid-could-result-in-negative-emissions-while-saving-drivers-money-v2g_illustration.png,N,,2025-10-16 11:16:02.170024

There are 5 permits currently under review in the SPEED program.

DEP is modernizing its permitting process by investing in new technology and reviewing processes to identify and eliminate bottlenecks.

In January, DEP launched a Permit Tracker to allow applicants and residents to monitor the progress of permits as they move through the review process.

Since 2023, DEP has also added 225 employees to carry out critical functions like public health and safety inspections and permit application reviews.

DEP has also implemented the PAyback program, which went into effect in November 2023 that assures a moneyback guarantee for permit applicants if their application is overdue for review by DEP.

Since the PAyback program was implemented, DEP has evaluated and decided on more than 76,000 permits without having to refund a single application fee.

DEP reviews more than 45,000 permit applications every year.

These include permits for land clearing activities for construction projects, air quality permits for factories and power plants, permits to upgrade drinking water systems to remove chemicals like PFAS ‘forever chemicals,’ mining activity, and permits for oil and gas wells.

With more efficient permit review from DEP, businesses in Pennsylvania can put shovels in the ground more quickly while still ensuring their projects meet standards to protect clean air and clean water.

The first test was the planned construction of a $3.5 billion power plant called Kaiparowits.
It would have been located in southern Utah, right in the middle of several parks, including Bryce Canyon, Zion, Grand Canyon, and Capitol Reef.
Redford began his journey as an environmental activist opposing Kaiparowits, and he very much had Stegner on the brain.
Redford’s appearance on 60 Minutes resulted in more than 6,000 letters to the show, most opposing the plant.","On April 17, 1976, over 500 residents of the small town of Kanab, Utah, cheered as they set fire to an effigy of a movie star wearing a blond wig.

To understand why, back up 22 years before then, to a time when a teenager named Charles Robert Redford Jr. made a detour on a road as he drove back from college in Boulder, Colorado, to his home in Los Angeles. A small ski resort, Timp Haven, occupied the spot he would later call Sundance.

“When I left, I couldn’t shake it off,” he said in Michael Feeney Callan’s biography, Robert Redford. “I lay in bed and thought about it. And whenever I had the chance to go back, I did. It became my favorite long shortcut, the only way to go home. I have a clear recollection of thinking, 'Someday I’d like to put a stake down here.’”

He did just that a few years later when he paid $500 for two acres. The land he found that day, in the shadow of Mount Timpanogos, would change his life. It was there that his love of the West would deepen, and out of that love grew his desire to fight for and protect it.

The first test was the planned construction of a $3.5 billion power plant called Kaiparowits.

*

Robert Redford knew the West.

He had rafted on the Colorado River, trekked into canyons, and, while shooting the timeless classic Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, first encountered the Kaiparowits Plateau.

“Having experienced the beauty and fragility of the area during filming for Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, I just couldn’t accept the idea that constructing a power plant in that location was a good one,” he said to his grandson Conner during one of his very last interviews in Orion magazine.

The Kaiparowits coal-fired plant was first proposed by Southern California Edison in 1965—a massive 3,000-megawatt installation slated to be the largest coal-fired plant in the world. It would have been located in southern Utah, right in the middle of several parks, including Bryce Canyon, Zion, Grand Canyon, and Capitol Reef. The plant, if it had been built, would have polluted both the water and air, emitting sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, as well as potential mercury poisoning. The plant was conceived as a source of power for California markets, a kind of electrical Chinatown.

At the time, Redford was not only exploring the West, he was reading it. Wallace Stegner, who wrote of the region as an arid, vulnerable, and threatened place, was among his favorite writers. Redford began his journey as an environmental activist opposing Kaiparowits, and he very much had Stegner on the brain.

“It was my first major conservation issue,” he told Callan, “and what I discovered very quickly was the mass of ignorance out there. It’s not just the greed of industrialists. It’s the lack of fundamental awareness, a mindset created over 150 years that says Manifest Destiny allows us to do what we will with the land. My passion came from the pages of Wallace Stegner, who prided himself on attachment to the land. We flew over the Escalante rocks, this paradise that had been untouched for millennia, and I thought about what Stegner had written: that here was a place where the silence allows you to hear the swish of falling stars.”

To his credit, Redford did not just lend his famous face to these environmental efforts. As Stegner once wrote, “Environmentalism or conservation or preservation or whatever it should be called, is not a fact, and never has been. It is a job.”

The job required sitting through dull meetings and the dirty work of lobbying. Right away, Redford took to it like an avid student. He did the boring stuff. He worked closely with the Natural Resource Defense Council, learning directly from John Adams, the president of the NRDC, who taught him the sometimes frustrating art of talking to members of Congress, trying, often futilely, to keep them to their words. It turned out they were willing to give some of their time to a movie star, but they could also say one thing to his face and another when it came time to vote.

Of course, he could get some things done many environmental activists could not, such as calling up 60 Minutes, which offered him a national forum to explain how the Kaiparowits plant would destroy the air and water in southern Utah. Redford’s appearance on 60 Minutes resulted in more than 6,000 letters to the show, most opposing the plant.

“I had to be careful,” he told the Deseret News. “I was very much aware of the double-edged sword of being a celebrity because there are a lot of people who resent you speaking out, who feel you have not earned the right, that you do not have the credibility and so forth. So I decided to really look at this plan because, in my gut, I felt it would be a terrible mistake. It was right in the middle of five contiguous national parks and monuments. We already had demonstrations of what other power plants had done to the quality of life in other areas.”

In his fight against Kaiparowits, Redford “requested the assistance of environmental groups, raised money to open an office in Salt Lake City, and hired a small staff to investigate the environmental and economic ramifications of the project.”

In large part thanks to Redford’s efforts and a coalition of environmental organizations, including the Sierra Club, Southern California Edison abandoned its plans to develop the plant.

It was a big victory for the environmental movement, but not everyone was pleased. After the news that the plant would not be built, hundreds of people in Kanab, where many believed the power plant would have been an economic boon, hung an effigy of the actor in protest.

“This is the time and day that we, the people of Kane County, have chosen to put a torch to skunkman Redford, self‐proclaimed voice of the hypocritical obstructionists,” John Nelson, the county engineer, told The New York Times at the time.

Redford was nonplussed. From Stegner, he had learned the timeworn ideal of stewardship of the land. Adams believed that the experience taught him a valuable lesson. In his autobiography, A Force of Nature, Adams remembered: “In Kanab, Utah, Bob was burned in effigy by people who blamed him for the loss of jobs and cheap energy. They called him an extremist and a backpacking kook. His family received threatening letters. He had been in the lion's den. One was that the bitterness that had marked the fight against Southern California Edison was something to be avoided, if possible. Perhaps there was a way to bring all parties in a dispute to the table and see what common ground existed to pursue this idea.”

The rest of Redford’s career as an environmentalist would be marked by a search for that common ground.

*

As for Kaiparowits, in 1996, Redford celebrated the creation of Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, which included the land where the Kaiparowits power plant would have been built. He’d fought hard for Grand Staircase, a then 1.7-million-acre expanse of land, with President Clinton singling him out as a key influence in the effort to create the monument. He stood beside Clinton during the official declaration.

Unfortunately, Clinton’s team decided to have the dedication ceremony not in Utah where the monument would be, but on the South Rim of the Grand Canyon in Arizona. No one, least of all Redford, understood why, perhaps out of a somewhat understandable fear of angry locals. This move was regarded as a perfect example of the hypocrisy of outsiders determining the fate of Utah’s land. Though Redford was far from an outsider at that point, having lived on and off in Utah for 35 years, he would always be regarded that way by some.

As for the small towns like Kanab bordering Grand Staircase-Escalante, the hotbeds of the anger about the declaration where the movie star was hung in effigy, the outrage gradually died down.

For now the wilderness protections are holding. But, as Redford would learn over the years, environmental victories can be tentative until there’s another reason to step forward and take a stand to protect our land, air, and water.

Robert Redford, during his life, did just that.",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootzine/favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-16 11:16:08.055953

“We’ll start to be able to go to electric fleets and reduce the cost straight up — no incentives, no tax breaks, no grants — versus a [gas-powered] fleet,” said CEO Rick Wilmer.
Charging networks have long angled to serve vehicle fleets, such as delivery companies, rideshare outfits and construction contractors, that typically have a large and predictable power demand.

For the past few years, charging networks, delivery fleets and retail hubs have been hustling to add infrastructure to provide juice to electric cars. The next step: helping drivers sell excess electrons back to the grid.

In August, ChargePoint Holdings Inc., a Silicon Valley-based company that operates roughly 35,000 fast-charging ports in the US, announced a new kind of station that will pump power to and from vehicles, as opposed to the vast majority of chargers, which simply take electrons from the grid.

ChargePoint hopes the system will win business from companies that operate large fleets of vehicles by providing the opportunity to sell the electrons sitting in idle cars and trucks.

“We’ll start to be able to go to electric fleets and reduce the cost straight up — no incentives, no tax breaks, no grants — versus a [gas-powered] fleet,” said CEO Rick Wilmer.

Charging networks have long angled to serve vehicle fleets, such as delivery companies, rideshare outfits and construction contractors, that typically have a large and predictable power demand. ChargePoint reckons the next phase of charging competition will be helping those companies monetize their vehicles. When the vehicles are idle and have extra electrons, they can uncork a tiny trickle of revenue, or at least help power nearby buildings. Often, these fleets are idle at the end of a work day, precisely when power demand is peaking on the typical grid.

“You’re ending up with a significantly better mousetrap,” Wilmer said.

At the same time, there’s a push among many companies to generate and store electricity onsite to safeguard against outages, arbitrage time-of-use power prices or get off the grid entirely. Those sites will now be able to tap into vehicles as part of their energy mix, according to Eaton Corp., a power management company that is partnering with ChargePoint on the new charging system. The stations, which ChargePoint has dubbed Express Grid, will also use electricity generated onsite, say from solar panels or wind turbines.

Companies are “adding distributed energy resources such as solar, storage and wind,” said Paul Ryan, vice president and general manager of energy transition at Eaton. “Now you have EVs that are battery assets.”

To be sure, not all utilities can or will accept electricity from anything that isn’t a power plant. Likewise, many of today’s EVs can only accept electrons, not feed them the other way, a process known as bi-directional charging. For example, Ford Motor Co.’s electric pick-up truck, the F-150 Lightning, can discharge its battery, but the company’s electric crossover, the Mustang Mach-E, doesn’t have that capability.

But many analysts expect so-called bidirectional charging will soon be ubiquitous in the EV market. And with more volatile weather and the rise of power-hungry data centers, US utilities are scrambling to get electricity wherever they can find it.

While ChargePoint and Eaton unveiled their new charging system on Thursday, they have yet to take orders. The companies expect to install the first such unit in the second half of next year.

Liberty Utilities, a gas utility with just over 60,000 customers in southeastern Massachusetts, is asking the state Department of Public Utilities to approve a 55.5% rate increase, on average, across all customers on a total bill basis. The proposed increase is far higher than typical rate hikes, and Liberty serves some of the most economically disadvantaged residents in Massachusetts. The company’s last rate case was in 2015.

Some customers in North Attleboro and Fall River would experience a monthly bill increase of approximately $78.86 (an approximate 37.0% increase in current rates) if the full rate hike is approved by regulators. Low-income residential customers in the area would be hit hard as well, experiencing a monthly bill increase of approximately $59.15 (a 37.0% increase), while low-income residential non-heating customers would experience a monthly bill increase of approximately $33.38, a staggering 80.9% increase.

Fall River has amongst the lowest median income per capita in the entire state at less than half the state average.

Currently, more than 1 in every 6 of Liberty’s residential customers (17%) are behind on paying their gas bills.

Removing Political Costs

Legislation introduced by State Senator Cynthia Creem and Representatives Steven Owens and Jennifer Armini this session would prohibit utilities from using ratepayer money for political, advocacy, and lavish expenses, which are unnecessary for the provision of safe and reliable service.

The bill prohibits utilities from charging their customers for lobbying; institutional or good will advertising, which is primarily designed to improve the image of the utility or the industry; litigation to influence, modify, or repeal existing federal, state or local regulations, legislation or ordinances; tax penalties or fines issued against a utility; travel, lodging, entertainment, gifts or food and beverage expenses for a utility’s board of directors and officers; aircraft for a utility’s board of directors; and investor relations.

The bill also prohibits utilities from using customer money to pay for attendance in contested proceedings conducted before the DPU, including rate case advocacy.

The legislation requires the state’s utilities to disclose those expenses annually and penalizes them for violations.

Portions of the legislation have been incorporated into Governor Maura Healey’s proposed package of utility affordability legislation.

Significant Savings

An analysis by EPI has found that in its current rate case, Liberty Utilities is seeking to recover from its customers some of the costs that would be prohibited by the utility accountability legislation. They include the following expenses:

Rate case expenses, which are the costs for the utility to submit its rate increase proposal to its regulator = $1,911,870 (to be recovered over the next 5 years, with a yearly recovery of $382,374). Over a third of those costs are for legal expenses.

Payments to trade associations and business groups = $124,376 ($112,414 industry + $11,962 non-industry)

Advertising = $24,884 (EPI removed over $19,000 in costs from an original sum submitted by Liberty as the utility marked them as “Regulatory Only” ads)

Investor Relations = $59,926

Board of Directors expenses = $82,901 (which Liberty says consist of “fees, benefits, and meeting costs”)

Together, these expenses total $674,461, on an annual basis.

With a total customer base of 60,976 (as of January 1, 2025), that would amount to over $11.06 in savings per customer, on average, per year.

Reached for comment, a Liberty Utilities spokesperson said via email: “As a matter of Company policy, Liberty does not comment on issues pertaining to on-going litigation.

If Massachusetts passes the accountability legislation, it would join a growing number of states who have taken similar action to rein in utility political cost recovery from customers. Most recently, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed such a bill into law this week. California joins Connecticut, Maine, and Colorado as states that have prohibited utilities from recovering expenses similarly to what legislators have proposed in Massachusetts.

Other states have passed laws prohibiting the recovery of narrower political costs such as lobbying and trade association dues, including New Hampshire, New York, and Maryland.",https://energyandpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Utility-Money-In-Politics.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 12:12:21.016688

A single data center can require over half the output of a nuclear reactor to power. Meanwhile, a typical facility may only employ around 50 full-time employees once constructed and increase power bills for ratepayers statewide in the long run.

With the rise of AI and other internet services driving up data center demand, North Carolina utility commissioner Tommy Tucker and the rest of the commission must determine how much ratepayers will subsidize the required grid upgrades.

“I’m just thinking about the guy out there in rural North Carolina [who] needs a good-paying job, why wouldn’t we go after that load and kind of side step some of the data centers?” Tucker asked during the hearing.

In addition to transmission improvements and tax revenue, Lucas Fykes, energy policy director for the Data Center Coalition, said data centers play a role in the broader economy:

“As you bring in data centers to North Carolina, you’re also going to bring in other operations that depend on data centers and that depend on reducing that latency, that data transfer time,” Fykes said.

Building beyond the next five years

Commissioners will use the information presented during this week’s hearing to inform their decision on Duke Energy’s 2025 resource plan. That plan forecasted an unprecedented rise in energy demand, which would grow at eight times the rate it had during the preceding 15 years.

“In the rush to meet customer demand, utilities may resort to resource portfolios that do not cost-efficiently serve the load that actually materializes and may hinder some long-term resource planning goals,” said Jeffrey Bower, a consultant with Daymark Energy Advisers.

Bower said utilities run the risk of building too much new infrastructure to serve data center projects that never come to fruition. The utility might also choose to invest in quickly buildable generators, like natural gas turbines, but ultimately won’t serve at their full capacity for the duration of their useful lifetime.

Commissioner Karen Kemerait echoed those concerns.

“We also want to make sure that we're not over-forecasting and then overbuilding the system for load that doesn't actually show up,” Kemerait said.

Fykes responded that utilities and state regulators should review companies’ histories to see if they have a track record of delivering on past projects.

“Utilities commissions should be required to publicly disclose the key assumptions, data sources and validation processes underlying both [their] base forecasts and the supplemental inputs,” Fykes said.

Building on spec

The North Carolina Utilities Commission does not directly forecast load growth. Duke Energy submits an energy demand forecast during the biennial resource planning process. The challenge for the utility and state regulators is to account for speculative development requests.

Some data center developers are exploring sites in multiple states for the same project, inflating nationwide energy demand forecasts. A Sierra Club analysis of 23 utilities found that the prospective data centers in their pipelines would require as much energy as the entire country currently generates.

“Clearly, there's a lot of speculation in that overall pipeline,” said Jeremy Fisher, principal advisor for climate and energy at Sierra Club. “It's the lack of transparency about what underlies those forecasts that actually creates the real risk on our system.”

That risk, he said, is building too much energy infrastructure and overbilling ratepayers to pay for ir. If utilities don’t publish what’s in their pipelines, then it can be challenging to account for speculative requests made across multiple states.

Some states have already taken action to improve transparency. The Georgia Power Company files a quarterly report that details the number of data center customers in the pipeline and their cumulative power demand.

“That allows the commission to understand who's joining the pipeline, who's leaving, why are they leaving, how is it affecting the megawatts,” Bower said.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/00777b9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1260+0+117/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F43%2Fa4%2Faac00466405ebc69d954944bb18d%2F2025-load-forecast-comparison-7percent.png,N,,2025-10-16 13:05:04.059708

The plan focuses on increasing clean energy production, improving energy efficiency and diversifying oil and gas supplies away from Russia.
Europe does appear to be gaining in one way from the U.S. pullback from clean energy.
Thirty years into global climate talks, the disconnect between promises and practices has never been so clear.","Fossil fuels still power much of the world, even though renewable energy has become cheaper in most places and avoids both pollution and the climate damage caused by burning coal, oil and natural gas.

To understand this paradox, it helps to look at how countries – particularly major greenhouse gas emitters, including the U.S., China and European nations – are balancing the pressures of rising electricity demand with the global need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that are warming the planet.

US embraces fossil fuels

The United States makes no secret of its fossil fuel ambitions. It has a wealth of fossil fuel reserves and a politically powerful oil and gas industry.

Since President Donald Trump took office in January 2025, his administration has been promoting oil and gas drilling and coal production, pointing to rising electricity demand to justify its moves, particularly to power artificial intelligence data centers.

Reviving the “drill, baby, drill” mantra, the Trump administration has now embraced a “mine, baby, mine” agenda to try to revive U.S. coal production, which fell dramatically over the past two decades as cheaper natural gas and renewable energy rose.

The Department of Interior on Sept. 29 rolled out a plan to “unleash American coal power” by opening 13 million acres of federal land to mining. The Department of Energy also pledged US$625 million to try to make coal competitive. It includes lowering the royalty rates mining companies pay and extending the operating lifespans of coal-fired power plants.

However, these initiatives further lock communities with coal plants into a carbon-intensive fossil fuel. Coal’s resurgence would also have public health costs. Its pollution is linked to respiratory illness, heart disease and thousands of premature deaths each year from 1999 to 2020 in the United States.

The Trump administration is also ceding the clean energy technology race to China. The administration is ending many renewable energy tax credits and pulling federal support for energy research projects.

I work in the Climate Policy Lab at The Fletcher School of Tufts University, where we maintain a suite of databases for analyzing countries’ energy research budgets. The Trump administration’s 2026 U.S. budget request would slash funding for energy research, development and demonstration to $2.9 billion — just over half the budget allocated in 2025. These energy research investments would fall to levels not seen since the mid-1980s or early 2000s, even when accounting for inflation.

China’s clean energy push – and coal expansion

While the United States is cutting renewable energy funding, China is doubling down on clean energy technologies. Its large government subsidies and manufacturing capacity have helped China dominate global solar panel production and supply chains for wind turbines, batteries and electric vehicles.

Cheaper Chinese-manufactured clean energy technologies have enabled many emerging economies, such as Brazil and South Africa, to reduce fossil fuel use in their power grids. Brazil surged into the global top five for solar generation in 2024, producing 75 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity and surpassing Germany’s 71 TWh.

The International Energy Agency now expects global renewable energy capacity to double by 2030, even with a sharp drop expected in U.S. renewable energy growth.

However, while China expands clean energy access around the world, its production and emissions from coal continue to rise: In the first half of 2025, China commissioned 21 gigawatts (GW) of new coal power plants, with projections of over 80 GW for the full year. This would be the largest surge in new coal power capacity in a decade for China. Although China pledged to phase down its coal use between 2026 to 2030, rising energy demand may make the plan difficult to realize.

China’s paradox — leading in clean energy innovations while expanding coal — reflects the tension between ensuring energy security and reducing emissions and climate impact.

Europe’s scramble for reliable energy sources

The European Union is pursuing strategies to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels amid the ongoing geopolitical tensions with Russia.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine exposed many countries to supply disruptions and geopolitical turmoil, and it triggered a global energy crisis as countries once reliant on Russian oil and gas scrambled to find alternatives.

In June 2025, the European Commission proposed a regulation to phase out Russian fossil fuel imports by the end of 2027, aiming to enhance energy security and stabilize prices. This initiative is part of the broader REPowerEU plan. The plan focuses on increasing clean energy production, improving energy efficiency and diversifying oil and gas supplies away from Russia.

Renewables are now the leading source of electric power in the EU, though natural gas and oil still account for more than half of Europe’s total energy supply.

The EU’s fossil energy phaseout plan also faces challenges. Slovakia and Hungary have expressed resistance to the proposed phaseout, citing concerns over energy affordability and the need for alternative supply sources. Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orbán said Hungary would continue importing Russian oil and gas. Cutting off these supplies, he asserted, would be an economic “disaster” and immediately reduce Hungary’s economic output by 4%.

The path to reducing Europe’s dependence on fossil fuels thus involves navigating internal disagreements and incentivizing long-run sustainable development. Europe does appear to be gaining in one way from the U.S. pullback from clean energy. Global investment in renewable energy, which hit a record high in the first half of 2025, increased in the EU as it fell in the U.S., according to BloombergNEF’s analysis.

Brazil: Torn on fossil fuels as it hosts climate talks

In November 2025, representatives from countries around the world will gather in Brazil for the annual United Nations climate conference, COP30. The meeting marks three decades of international climate negotiations and a decade since nations signed the Paris Agreement to limit global temperature rise.

The conference’s setting in Belém, a city in the Amazon rainforest, reflects both the stakes and contradictions of climate commitments: a vital ecosystem at risk of collapse as the planet warms, in a nation that pledges climate leadership while expanding oil and gas production and exploring for oil in the Foz do Amazonas region, the mouth of the Amazon River.

Thirty years into global climate talks, the disconnect between promises and practices has never been so clear.

In a new policy report, Clean Air Task Force (CATF) offers a menu of state policy options —adaptable to states’ energy and economic priorities—to create the conditions needed to attract and deploy future fusion energy projects.

Fusion energy refers to the release of energy from the fusing of two atomic nuclei–the same reaction that powers the Sun. The fusion industry has entered a new era of rapid progress. In the last few years, the number of fusion energy companies worldwide has more than quadrupled, driven by record levels of private capital and breakthroughs in enabling technologies such as industrial scale production of high-temperature super conductors and artificial intelligence. Multiple private developers are now putting forward credible plans to connect fusion energy machines to the power grid by the early 2030s.

States can expect an array of benefits from the deployment of future fusion energy machines. Their production of clean, firm power may enable the replacement of retiring fossil fuel infrastructure and increase generation to meet load growth. Fusion energy machines could also complement intermittent renewable energy resources to lower energy system costs and improve grid reliability. The abundant availability of fusion fuel can enhance energy security by reducing reliance on imported or constrained resources, while the operational profile of fusion energy machines could make them well suited to power data centers. Beyond energy benefits, fusion energy deployment may drive economic growth—spurring job creation across construction, manufacturing, and supply chains—and position early-mover states as leaders in a globally competitive clean energy market.

The current landscape of state fusion energy policy

Although the first commercial fusion energy machine has not yet been connected to the grid, the state policy and regulatory environments of today will determine where companies puts their machines on the grid tomorrow. Over the course of the past year, multiple states took steps to create an enabling policy environment for fusion energy deployment.

Connecticut became the fortieth Agreement State on September 30th “Agreement States” are states with delegated authority from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to regulate most uses of radioactive materials (including fusion energy machines, but also other industrial and medical uses of radioactive materials). Becoming an Agreement State gives a state significantly more control over regulatory readiness and responsiveness than a state that defers radiological licensing authority over fusion energy to the NRC.

Virginia explicitly defined fusion energy in statute, explicitly classifying fusion energy as a “carbon-free” or “clean energy” source. This put fusion alongside solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and nuclear in the state’s definitions, providing legal clarity for fusion energy projects.

Washington passed legislation allowing fusion energy projects to utilize permitting reforms available to other clean energy sources.

Wisconsin passed legislation to enable a study identifying possible sites in the state for deployment of fusion energy machines.

As more states consider how to position themselves for a fusion energy future, the focus will increasingly turn to aligning existing clean energy policies—such as siting processes, permitting requirements, and electricity procurement standards—to include fusion energy as an eligible technology for support.

State policy options to support fusion energy deployment

While fusion energy is a new energy technology, states do not need to reinvent the wheel to create an effective policy environment for its commercial deployment. In some areas, fusion energy may require tailored policies, but in most cases, the priority will be ensuring that broader state-level clean energy tools apply to fusion energy.

Clean Air Task Force’s new policy brief offers 10 options states can use to support fusion energy deployment:

Strengthen State Regulatory Capacity: States can strengthen their regulatory readiness and responsiveness by becoming Agreement States, and if already Agreement States, by ensuring their respective implementing agency is adequately resourced to effectively engage with fusion energy developers throughout the licensing process for fusion energy machines to allow for an efficient and thorough licensing process based on based on proportional, technology-inclusive, and performance-based principles.

Expedite Permitting: Efficient permitting processes for the eventual commercial deployment of fusion energy machines will reduce uncertainty for fusion energy developers.

Ensure Efficient Siting Processes: States can ease siting processes for fusion energy machines using typical steps used to incentivize other large projects, such as feasibility studies, site certification programs, reduced property taxes, and waived permitting fees. Former fossil fuel sites also present strong opportunities for fusion energy development by offering existing high-capacity grid connections for reuse. States can support such “fusion brightfields” projects with build-ready programs, brownfield remediation incentives, and liability protections.

Clearing Interconnection Queues: States can press for progress at the grid operator level to clear interconnection backlogs so fusion energy machines can deliver power when commercially ready.

Defining Fusion Energy Explicitly in State Statutes: States can define fusion energy in statutes to reduce uncertainty and to clarify which state policies apply to fusion energy. Furthermore, defining fusion energy in state statutes as a clean energy source can further enable fusion energy to benefit from broader clean energy incentives.

Including Fusion Energy in Clean Energy Standards (CES) and Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS): States can adopt or amend electricity standards to qualify fusion energy as an eligible energy source.

Creating Fusion Energy Tax Incentives: Offering targeted or technology-neutral tax credits can de-risk private investment and help to attract and retain fusion energy startups and component manufacturers.

Funding and Financing Tools for Fusion Energy: Ensuring fusion energy developers have access to financing tools to bridge early-stage commercialization gaps may encourage them to site in a state.

Establishing Innovation Hubs and Cultivating a Fusion Energy Workforce: Concentrated “fusion hubs” around universities and national laboratories can foster entrepreneurship, strengthen supply chains, and develop the skilled workforce fusion energy ecosystems will require.

Promoting Public Acceptance: Clear communication of fusion energy’s anticipated benefits and operational safety profile as well as active community engagement will be important to ensure public support for fusion energy deployment.

The road ahead for fusion deployment in states

As fusion energy moves closer to commercial reality, states have a window of opportunity to prepare. Proactive policy design today can help states position themselves to create an effective environment for fusion energy deployment tomorrow.

There is no single policy approach that will work for every state, nor do states need to adopt every option outlined in the brief. Instead, the most effective strategy is to support innovation and engage communities, while selecting the policies that best fit each state’s unique circumstances and energy goals. By doing so, and by engaging early with the fusion industry, electric utilities, developers, and other stakeholders, states can position themselves as leaders in the commercial deployment of fusion energy in the coming years.",https://cdn.catf.us/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/15132901/StatePolicyOptions.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 11:13:36.588925

Background: Facilitated by NASEO, Idaho National Laboratory, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and the Department of Energy’s Gateway for Accelerated Innovation in Nuclear, the Advanced Nuclear First Mover Initiative is being led by state cochairs New York, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Wyoming, with participating states Louisiana, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Utah, Virginia, and West Virginia.

According to NASEO, the governors of these states are committed to working with the private sector, the DOE, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to accelerate advanced nuclear projects and bring more power to the electric grid for reliability, sustainability, and economic growth.

On September 16, NASEO issued a request for information on the initiative to provide the organization and first mover states with information on a potential structure for an advanced nuclear project orderbook strategy, status and use cases for different nuclear technologies, and investment and coordination models.

“The orderbook approach moves away from one-off demonstrations to propel widespread market adoption by building a robust demand signal for the most viable advanced nuclear technologies,” NASEO said.

The deadline for the RFI was recently extended from October 10 to October 17.

Recommendations: Noting that the lack of a safe, permanent waste solution remains one of Americans’ top concerns about nuclear power, Deep Isolation said its recommendations draw on consensus across the advanced reactor industry, as reflected in the U.S. Nuclear Industry Council’s “Action Plan for Transforming the Back End of the U.S. Nuclear Fuel Cycle.”

“Deep Isolation calls on NASEO to integrate USNIC’s recommendations into its orderbook strategy: working collaboratively with communities to accelerating innovative disposal technologies, launching near-term demonstrations, and mobilizing private investment through public-private partnerships and legislative reform,” the company said.

Deep Isolation’s submission highlights three specific calls to action for participating states:

Join the Deep Borehole Demonstration Center, a Cameron, Texas, nonprofit where the company plans to conduct a full-scale nonradioactive deep borehole disposal pilot with initial canister emplacement targeted for 2027.

Support early borehole demonstrations in their states, including via joint initiatives with the DOE at federal laboratories such as INL or ORNL (consistent with President Trump’s Executive Order 14302 to leverage these sites for innovative nuclear demonstrations).

Tesla now holds 41% of the EV market, down from 80% four years ago as competitors rapidly gain ground.

General Motors has emerged as a strong competitor, capturing 15% of EV sales in the quarter, up from 10% in the same period last year. The company’s growth was driven largely by its new Chevrolet Equinox, which ranked as the third best-selling electric vehicle.

According to BloombergNEF data, nearly half of US electric vehicle purchases in the first half of 2025 were completed without any federal incentives.

Thanks to federal tax credits, biofuel producers will be able to pay farmers at least two times more an acre for crops than most food companies, finds a study by management consultancy Bain & Company — with the potential to disrupt agricultural markets.

The 45Z clean fuel production credit was introduced in 2025 under the Inflation Reduction Act to incentivise the domestic production of low-carbon transport fuels, including sustainable aviation fuel and biomass-based diesel.

While the Donald Trump administration revoked many of the IRA’s key tax credits in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, it extended the 45Z credit, which was set to expire in 2027, to 2029.

There will be “much greater competition” between food and fuel producers, particularly for major crops such as corn and soya, Bain partner Andrew Keech said in a statement.

This is not the first time US federal policy has reshaped agricultural markets, the report notes. Between 2005 and 2012, inflation-adjusted corn prices leapt up by 193 per cent, driven in part by a government mandate to blend gasoline with ethanol.

“Today’s potential biofuels boom may not unfold in the same way, but the strategic risks are familiar,” the report says.

Global demand for biofuels is set to rise exponentially in the coming years as hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation and shipping work to decarbonise.

More pressure on food companies

This comes as food companies are already facing pricing pressures, reduced supply chain resilience, and greater difficulty obtaining key ingredients, the report notes.

As biofuel producers are able to bid more aggressively for farmland acres, food companies could face “higher input prices, reduced access to sustainable ingredients, and challenges in meeting both sustainability commitments and supply chain ambitions”, it says.

Bain estimates that biofuel producers will be able to pay up to $180 an acre thanks to the tax credits. It contrasts that with the $15–$35 an acre food companies typically offer.

In 2025, just 9 per cent of US-grown corn is expected to enter the human food supply, compared with 38 per cent for animal feed, 35 per cent for ethanol production, and 18 per cent for exports, says the report. Eight per cent of US-grown soya will be used for human consumption this year.

Remedies available

Bain recommends that food companies start by mapping their most critical ingredients and where they are sourced from, quantifying how overlaps with biofuel demand could affect their ability to secure a sustainable supply. It also suggests that companies explore sourcing alternatives and develop contingency plans before problems emerge.

“As extreme weather events increase and temperatures rise, supply chain resilience will be mission critical,” says the report. “The food industry’s resilience will depend on how quickly companies adapt to this new reality.”",https://d2iztrg3kgqpue.cloudfront.net/production/c01d6497-e6da-405a-a779-d0a5fad456f0.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 09:00:01.265043

By then, Tesla had a 63% market share in the electric segment in the US, while GM represented 10%.

Back in 2021, CEO Mary Barra told CNBC she was “absolutely” convinced that GM would surpass Tesla as EV leader within four years.

By then, Tesla had a 63% market share in the electric segment in the US, while GM represented 10%.

Questioned by reporter Phil LeBeau if the CEO thought they could “catch Tesla by 2025,” Barra said “absolutely.”

In the same interview, the chief executive added that GM would “keep working until we have number one market share in EVs.”

Tesla‘s market share has declined over the past four years, as competition from both legacy automakers entering the segment and new pure EV makers rose.

However, it still remains at least three times larger than the combined market share of all General Motors‘ brands.

In the first nine months of 2025, and according to data from Cox Automotive, Tesla held a 43.2% share of the EV market.

GM, on the other hand, totaled 13.9%, combining Chevrolet‘s 8.3%, Cadillac‘s 3.7% and GMC’s 1.9%.

The Detroit automaker set several ambitious goals when it comes to electric vehicle production in 2021, as CEO Mary Barra targeted GM to be electric-only by 2035.

The company also planned for half of its North American and China factories be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030.

Four years ago, GM announced that it was investing $35 billion on both electric and autonomous vehicles — including battery development, new models and converting its plants to accommodate EV production.

But as of 2025, these plans have been dramatically scaled back and will cost the company $1.6 billion in the third quarter.

General Motors said earlier this week that it expects “the adoption rate of EVs to slow,” following “recent US Government policy changes,” referring to the end of the $7,500 consumer credit on EV purchases and leasing.

In August, the company had already stated that “we will almost certainly see a smaller EV market for a while, and we won’t overproduce.”

Still, GM believes that its brands can “continue to grow EV market share” after the deadline.

In the third quarter, the company delivered a record 66,501 EVs, as demand rose ahead of the credit deadline.

Tesla, on the other hand, delivered an all-time record 497,099 electric vehicles in the July-September period.

Earlier this year, General Motors announced that it was investing $4 billion to expand production of petrol-powered vehicles in several of its US factories.

It included its plants in Orion, Fairfax and Spring Hill — which were all producing electric vehicles.

Telling its employees it would produce internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles as demand was higher, GM halted its plans to produce EVs in Orion,

Last month, Reuters also reported that the company is ending production of two electric Cadillac SUVs in Spring Hill by the end of this year.

According to X user ‘alojoh,’ GM has booked over $7.1 billion in write-offs and restructuring charges in the past twelve months, according to SEC filings.

These include not only the $1.6 billion charges from its EV business slowdown, but also $4 billion for reorganizing its joint venture in China with state-owned SAIC Motor.",https://i0.wp.com/eletric-vehicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GM_Barra.jpeg?fit=1200%2C676&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-16 11:15:47.118237

As Industry Dive notes, this move is seen as a significant reversal and a signal of Stellantis’s renewed commitment to U.S. manufacturing.
The hope is that this new leadership, coupled with the massive U.S. investment, will help turn around the company’s fortunes.
Stellantis’s strategy also includes launching 19 refreshed products across its U.S. manufacturing facilities through 2029, many featuring updated powertrains.
GM, another major U.S. automaker, has also announced similar moves, committing $4 billion earlier this year to expand its own U.S. manufacturing capabilities.","Stellantis, one of the world’s largest automakers, has announced a sweeping $13 billion investment plan to revitalize and expand its manufacturing presence across the United States—a move that stands as the largest single outlay in the company’s 100-year history. The announcement, made on October 15, 2025, marks a pivotal moment for Stellantis as it seeks to boost domestic vehicle production by 50% over the next four years, launch five new vehicles, and create over 5,000 new jobs across key Midwestern states.

According to Automotive News and confirmed by a company press release on October 14, the investment will be distributed among four major manufacturing hubs: Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana. The plan includes reopening the once-shuttered Belvidere Assembly Plant in Illinois, launching a new midsize pickup in Ohio, producing a next-generation Dodge Durango in Detroit, and rolling out a new four-cylinder engine in Indiana. The company’s leadership, now under CEO Antonio Filosa, is betting big on a resurgence in the American auto market—and on the enduring appeal of its Jeep, Dodge, and Ram brands.

""This investment in the U.S. — the single largest in the Company’s history — will drive our growth, strengthen our manufacturing footprint and bring more American jobs to the states we call home,"" said Filosa in a statement reported by Industry Dive. He emphasized that accelerating growth in the U.S. has been a top priority since his first day as CEO. ""Success in America is not just good for Stellantis in the U.S.—it makes us stronger everywhere,"" Filosa added.

The centerpiece of the initiative is the $600 million reopening of the Belvidere Assembly Plant in Illinois, which Stellantis had closed in February 2023 as part of a cost-cutting effort. Now, the plant is poised for a comeback, with plans to expand production of the Jeep Cherokee and Jeep Compass SUVs for the U.S. market. The facility is expected to create roughly 3,300 jobs and begin producing vehicles in 2027. As Industry Dive notes, this move is seen as a significant reversal and a signal of Stellantis’s renewed commitment to U.S. manufacturing.

Meanwhile, in Ohio, Stellantis will invest $400 million into its Toledo Assembly Complex to build an all-new midsize pickup. Production is scheduled to start in 2028 and is expected to add about 900 jobs. The Ohio plant will continue to produce the Jeep Wrangler and Gladiator, two of the company’s most iconic models.

Michigan is also set to benefit from the investment. Stellantis plans to pour $100 million into its Warren Truck Assembly Plant to produce an all-new range-extended electric vehicle (EV) and a new full-size SUV with an internal combustion engine. Production at this plant is expected to start in 2028. The Warren facility currently manufactures the Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer, and Stellantis recently unveiled the redesigned 2026 Grand Wagoneer, which will be offered with two powertrain options: a range-extended version and a 3.0-liter Hurricane twin-turbo engine.

Detroit’s Assembly Complex will see $130 million invested to prepare for the next-generation Dodge Durango SUV, with production targeted to begin in 2029. Over in Indiana, the Kokomo plant will start producing the all-new four-cylinder GMET4 EVO engine in 2026, backed by an investment of over $100 million and expected to add more than 100 jobs.

Unlike many recent auto industry investments, Stellantis’s plan is not focused primarily on electrification. Only one of the five new vehicles will be a range-extended EV, with the rest being traditional or hybrid internal combustion models. This approach reflects a strategic decision to balance consumer demand for both electric and gasoline-powered vehicles, especially as the U.S. market remains divided on the pace of EV adoption.

Stellantis’s investment comes at a time of significant transition and challenge for the company. After years of declining sales and profits in North America and Europe, the automaker is working to regain its footing. In July 2025, Stellantis reported that its first-half revenues had fallen 13% compared to the previous year, resulting in an operating loss of 2.3 billion euros. Net revenue for the first six months of 2025 dropped to 74.3 billion euros, which Stellantis attributed mainly to sales declines and a loss of market share.

The shakeup at the top was swift. Antonio Filosa, who took over as CEO on June 23, 2025, after the resignation of Carlos Tavares in December 2024, quickly announced a new leadership team. According to Industry Dive, Filosa described his new executive team as individuals who ""bring an entrepreneurial spirit and profound understanding of the company’s brands."" The hope is that this new leadership, coupled with the massive U.S. investment, will help turn around the company’s fortunes.

Stellantis currently operates 34 manufacturing facilities, distribution centers, and research and development sites in the U.S., supporting more than 48,000 employees. The new investment is expected to add over 5,000 jobs, a significant boost for communities across the Midwest. The reopening of the Belvidere plant alone is projected to have a major economic impact on the region, which has faced job losses and uncertainty since the facility’s closure.

The timing of Stellantis’s move is not accidental. The announcement follows the imposition of tariffs that have made importing vehicles from regions like Mexico, Canada, and Europe—where Stellantis also operates—considerably more expensive. There is also political pressure: former President Donald Trump has repeatedly called for more auto manufacturing to return to the U.S., and the current economic climate has made domestic investment more attractive for global automakers.

Investors responded positively to the news. Stellantis stock climbed more than 5% in after-hours trading following the announcement, and shares continued to trade about 1% higher in midday trading the next day, as reported by Automotive News.

Stellantis’s strategy also includes launching 19 refreshed products across its U.S. manufacturing facilities through 2029, many featuring updated powertrains. ""As we begin our next 100 years, we are putting the customer at the center of our strategy, expanding our vehicle offerings and giving them the freedom to choose the products they want and love,"" Filosa said, underscoring the company’s focus on consumer choice and flexibility.

GM, another major U.S. automaker, has also announced similar moves, committing $4 billion earlier this year to expand its own U.S. manufacturing capabilities. This trend signals a broader industry shift toward strengthening domestic production in response to global supply chain disruptions, shifting consumer preferences, and evolving trade policies.

The pattern is the same: when selfishness is unconstrained, private wealth bends public institutions toward private ends.","Recently, ICE used tear gas, shot pepper spray bullets and flash bang grenades, and arrested protestors outside the ICE facility in Broadview, just outside of Chicago. On the second day of protests, my husband and I, who have lived in Chicago for 35 years, joined the protesters who gathered.

Witnessing van after van pulling into the Broadview facility with heavily armed and fully masked ICE workers pulling out of the van, young men, teens, and older adults was frightening.

This action came slightly more than a week after ICE agents in Franklin Park, a Chicago suburb, killed a restaurant worker and father of two, Silverio Villegas-Gonzales, who had no criminal record, after a vehicle stop.

The scale of these attacks risks erasure of a profoundly important cultural presence. Contrary to the promise to rid the country of what President Donald Trump calls the “worst of the worst,” including drug dealers, murderers, and rapists, this is an attack on vulnerable workers who have migrated for work to advance their own and their families’ futures and find themselves in informal work situations.

As a public health professor and community-based participatory researcher, for more than a decade, I have explored community-led solutions to occupational health concerns in Chicago neighborhoods with high proportions of informal workers.

Their work is outside of formal employment structures with standardized pay and worker protections. Informal workers’ work conditions are generally considered precarious as they are exposed to unique physical, social, and environmental hazards. Workers typically engage in informal work because formal work is not often available due to citizenship status, language, ability, or related contextual factors.

People migrate for work as pay allows for basic needs to be met. It is a protected human right to seek safety, refuge, and the opportunity to work.

Informal workers often engage in work outside, in public spaces. They are exposed to unsafe environmental conditions, police and public harassment, and lack standard work conditions, such as access to a bathroom.

Well-recognized in their urban neighborhoods, these workers include street food vendors selling tamales, shaved ice, and nopales, and day laborers who stand in the parking lots of Home Depot or Menards, waiting for a work opportunity.

In order to make a living for themselves and their families (much of their pay is sent to family members in their country of origin), day laborers get into cars or vans, not knowing where they are being taken, what the work will be, if they will get paid, and when they will return.

The work is often extremely precarious and hazardous, and there is a high rate of exploitation in which day laborers engage in work that goes unpaid, knowing they have no recourse.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recognize work as a social determinant of health. Work typically impacts health through three pathways: hazardous working conditions (physical, chemical, biologic, and psychosocial), work-stressors, and risks to material deprivation (income, wealth, housing, or neighborhood hardship).

Little is known about the impacts of the work conditions of these informal workers on their health. However, our research found that among a sample of precariously employed workers in a neighborhood, those in the highest precarity category were Latinx and born outside the United States.

The research found that the most employment precarity experienced is significantly associated with self-reported exposure to chemical and biological hazards, physical hazards, and slip, trip, strike, fall, trap, or crush hazards at work.

To be sure, undocumented immigrants face social and economic challenges in the United States. However, undocumented immigrant workers such as street vendors and day laborers play a critical role in the day-to-day lives of neighborhoods.

Street vendors are often up by 3 a.m. and on the street by 4 a.m. to provide breakfast (tamales) for their neighbor workers headed to factory work. They are still on the street when these workers head home for dinner, more than 12 hours later.

They anticipate their customers and have their orders prepared in advance. They are a constant presence in their communities, serving as the neighborhood’s eyes and ears, assuring students get safely to and from school. Their false criminalization and the violent extraction of their lives from the fabric of our communities will have lasting harm.

Undocumented immigrants contribute to the economy as they pay taxes. In Illinois alone, in 2022, undocumented immigrants paid an estimated $1.55 billion in federal, state, and local taxes, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.

This past month, many informal workers have been unable to work, given the administration’s attack on immigrants. These workers work hand to mouth. A workday lost impacts the family concretely—a loss of food for family meals, not being able to afford school supplies, and/or a risk of loss of housing.

Research has shown that immigrants, including undocumented immigrants, are less likely than those born in the U.S. to commit violent crime. Waves of higher immigration have not seen increases in crime rates but rather reduced crime rates.

The tragic shooting recently at an ICE facility by a sniper in Dallas, killing two detainees, is being blamed by the administration on “rhetoric” opposing ICE. These acts, plus amped up immigration raids across the country, contribute to heightened fear and uncertainty.

Neighborhoods across the country are under attack. Those who support this vicious assault on communities have been misguided. Immigrants are core to the American story. This is an assault on the fabric of our communities.

Adams distinguished between subjects and citizens. Subjects were ruled. Citizens participated. But citizenship required more than casting a vote. It demanded habits that sustain a free society: honesty, moderation, service, and fairness. A republic cannot rest on the hope that enough citizens will voluntarily restrain themselves. History shows that when virtue fails, only clear rules—laws that promote fairness and institutions that protect the public good—can prevent private power from overwhelming democracy itself. Without these guardrails, inequality grows unchecked, cynicism deepens, and democracy itself becomes vulnerable to collapse.

That lesson feels urgent in an age when material success is celebrated as the highest good. Wealth today buys more than comfort—it buys political influence and cultural authority. Since Citizens United v. FEC in 2010, billionaire political spending has exploded. In 2024, just 100 families spent $2.6 billion on elections—more than millions of small donors combined. Pharmaceutical companies spend millions to block reforms that would make medicine affordable. Tech companies lobby against rules designed to keep markets fair. Defense contractors protect massive budgets, even for weapons the military no longer wants. The pattern is the same: when selfishness is unconstrained, private wealth bends public institutions toward private ends.

Adams foresaw this danger. In his 1776 letter to Warren, he warned that “the spirit of commerce…is incompatible with that purity of heart, and greatness of soul which is necessary for a happy Republic.” He did not reject commerce. He saw its energy as essential. But he feared what happens when wealth becomes the only measure of worth and when no boundary—internal or external—checks its pursuit.

The problem, then, is not wealth itself. It is selfishness without limits. Private virtue can restrain it, but when virtue fails, public rules must step in. A healthy republic cannot depend on individual moderation alone. It needs laws that channel economic energy toward the common good: rules that protect fair competition, transparency that exposes corruption, and institutions that reward service over greed.

As I explored in “American Whiplash: A Republic in Cycles”, the United States has repeatedly gone through periods of excess followed by correction. The Progressive Era curbed monopolies. The New Deal built protections in the midst of a crisis. The Civil Rights Movement expanded freedom by forcing the nation to honor its promise of equality. In each case, selfishness was constrained by citizens insisting on fairness and leaders willing to act.

The question now is whether we still have the will to repeat that work. A republic cannot survive if selfishness is allowed to rule unchecked. Adams’s warning was plain: liberty itself will wither when wealth is prized over character. Some may grow very rich, but few will remain free. The true test of the republic is whether it can summon both private virtue and public courage to place the common good above private gain.

The canceled $464 million federal award would have helped pay for the $1.8 billion cost of building power lines to connect two regional grids spanning much of middle America — a project meant to move wind power across state lines and eliminate bottlenecks that are contributing to rising electricity prices.

Seen through the lens of President Donald Trump’s priorities, the power lines would appear to be just the kind of federally backed conduits for wind power that he and his closest advisers abhor. Seen through another lens, the canceled DOE grant threatens a grid expansion that should fit squarely inside the White House’s “energy dominance” agenda, grid officials say — bolstering infrastructure to move more electrons from all sources onto U.S. power grids.

The decision to kill funding for the Minnesota-based effort to build the power lines comes after DOE in July stripped another giant electricity project of federal financial support: a $4.9 billion loan guarantee for the Grain Belt Express, a 780-mile, extra-high-voltage line that would bring massive amounts of wind power from Kansas to the eastern grid, PJM.

In Minnesota, a planning process called the Joint Targeted Interconnection Queue is conceived as a first-of-a-kind partnership between two big regional grid operators: Midcontinent Independent System Operator and Southwest Power Pool. MISO runs the high-voltage grid in all or parts of 15 states from Minnesota to Louisiana, and SPP flanks MISO’s western border and delivers power from the Dakotas to Texas.

Rather than investing in one or two supersized transmission projects, JTIQ planners pinpointed choke points that restrict power flows along the two systems’ common boundary and leave both grids less secure. The DOE grant would have shifted some of the upfront investment in new transmission to federal taxpayers.

“Without these investments, Minnesota could face higher energy prices, slower infrastructure development, and increased burdens on low- and middle-income households — all while demand for clean, affordable energy continues to grow,” the Minnesota Department of Commerce protested after the White House lumped the grant cancellation in with $8 billion in cuts announced on Oct. 1.

At the project’s beginning in 2020, planners assumed that wind and solar power would be the main beneficiaries of greater transmission capacity, documents show. It was primarily clean energy projects that were requesting entry onto regional grids, and the most expansive scenario envisioned the doubling of wind and solar output in the central U.S.

So far, it’s unclear whether the funding reversal puts the entire project at risk.

There is no public analysis from DOE explaining why this grant and more than 300 others on DOE’s list were killed, except for the broad-brush denunciations this month from DOE Secretary Chris Wright and Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought.

“Nearly $8 billion in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled,” Vought celebrated on X.

Wright concluded in a statement that the canceled projects “were not economically viable and would not provide a positive return on investment.” House Democrats, noting that projects in blue states had been singled out, shot back, “That is a pretext for cancellations that track political talking points, not facts.”

In May, Wright released a memorandum outlining DOE’s criteria for reviewing projects.

The canceled DOE projects, and those on a longer DOE target list not confirmed by the department with $23 billion in awards tentatively listed as “terminated,” stand as a test of how the Trump administration will address unprecedented pressures that are mounting on the nation’s aging, stressed power systems.

‘Flowing across the seams’

Meanwhile, the need for the projects linking the regional grids and their value to consumers continue to grow, according to a pair of voluminous analyses, one the DOE Transmission Needs study in 2023 and the other by the grid’s security monitor, the North American Electric Reliability Corp.

As the JTIQ plan was being prepared, in 2021 and 2022, two huge Arctic storms swept through the Midwest. Winter Storm Uri paralyzed large parts of Texas and caused billions of dollars in windfall energy charges. Winter Storm Elliott triggered rolling blackouts in the Carolinas and the Tennessee Valley Authority.

Stronger links between MISO and SPP would have permitted more power to flow in these emergencies, contributing to a network that was “bigger than the weather,” as grid planners are urging.

In extreme weather onslaughts, scarce power supplies have caused spot electricity prices to erupt from hundreds of dollars per megawatt-hour to thousands of dollars, according to the 2023 DOE Needs study.

Grid Strategies, a research firm supporting transmission expansion, estimated that every dollar invested in stronger ties between MISO and SPP would pay $7-10 in benefits in weather emergencies, primarily by reducing overcrowding on lines that produce price surges.

“Consumers in the Great Plains [in SPP], and those in the Gulf Coast states [in MISO], each could have saved in excess of $100 million with an additional 1 GW of transmission ties,” Grid Strategies estimated.

Now, the surge in development of artificial intelligence data centers — a top Trump priority — is adding even more urgency to grid expansion.

By 2031, when the JTIQ projects are scheduled to come online, the biggest need for grid capacity in the central U.S. may come from data centers.

Strengthening transmission capacity along the MISO-SPP seam supports the connection of all types of new generators, and all new power users, whether data centers, factories or shale oil production, said Michael Goggin, executive vice president of Grid Strategies, in an interview.

“Generation from all energy sources flows across that seam, and all benefit from reduced congestion,” Goggin said.

Wrench in the innovation pipeline

Some grant recipients say they will challenge DOE actions. Others promise to go on even without DOE.

The Solar and Storage Industries Institute, the research and education unit of the Solar Energy Industries Association, noted in a statement that two of the institute’s grants are on the longer list of targeted projects. Both aim to increase public understanding and engagement in new power project development.

“While it is unclear if these proposed cancellations are final, there is no doubt that in cancelling grants like these, the administration would make it harder to build the energy infrastructure Americans rely on,” Institute Executive Director David Gahl said. “We will use every tool in our toolbox to defend them.”

California was a major target in the first $8 billion in cancellations.

For example, the Imperial Irrigation District has delivered hydropower electricity to people in Southern California for nearly a century. It was in line for a $18.3 million grant, which it would match, to install a system to help streamline operation, speed outage recovery, and aid in connecting renewable energy. It would directly aid disadvantaged, “economically challenged” communities in its region, potentially raising a red flag for Trump administration officials scrutinizing federal projects that benefit “woke” inclusion agendas.

“While we are appealing this, we remain focused on moving forward with the project,” said Imperial Irrigation District spokesperson Robert Schettler. “Since we won’t have the full $36.7 million that was planned for this project, we are seeing what we can trim from the original plan so that we can continue to make headway.”

Two companies on DOE’s longer list, Ascend Elements and American Battery Technology Co., also declared they will go ahead.

American Battery Technology Co. said in a filing Wednesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it is appealing an Oct. 9 DOE decision to terminate a $57 million grant to build a plant to manufacture lithium hydroxide for batteries. The company declined to comment, but said in the filing it would move forward with the project “regardless of the outcome of the appeal process,” noting it has raised $52 million in public markets.

The company’s stock fell sharply in after-hours trading after the filing

Ascend received two DOE grants totaling $480 million in 2022 funded by the Infrastructure and Investment Jobs Act, to manufacture components for lithium-ion batteries from recycled electric vehicle batteries at a planned $1 billion plant in Hopkinsville, Kentucky. The battery components would compete with supply that now comes primarily from China, the company said.

After Trump’s DOE took office, the company agreed with DOE to suspend the smaller, $164 million grant for one of its patented battery component products, because of “changing market conditions.”

According to the company, $206 million of the grant had already been disbursed, so the cancellation was essentially on the remaining $110 million.

DOE’s action “doesn’t change our trajectory,” Ascend Elements CEO Linh Austin said in a statement. “We will replace the terminated grant,” with private capital and investments by European partners, he added.

In a statement, DOE spokesperson Ben Dietderich said “no determinations have been made other than what has been previously announced. As Secretary Wright made clear, the Department continues to conduct an individualized and thorough review of financial awards made by the previous administration.”

If Ascend Elements’ plant opens in 2026, it would culminate development of a patented lithium recycling process that was conceived 14 years ago by scientists at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, a private Massachusetts research institute.

An unaddressed issue in the DOE cutback is the impact on the nation’s innovation pipeline that is deeply rooted in academic research centers, the path Ascend Elements followed.

University research was a primary target on the list of $23 billion DOE awards tentatively ticketed for termination. More than 70 colleges, universities and academic research institutes would lose $3 billion in DOE grants if the actions on the large termination list become final.

Speaking ‘Trump’

Some other recipients notified of canceled grants declined to comment on next steps, which could include filing an appeal with DOE, going to court, going on alone, or giving up.

The Electric Power Research Institute, the grid sector’s leading independent non-profit R&D organization, has 11 grants totaling $64 million on the large list, but EPRI’s spokesman said it was not commenting on DOE’s action.

Some companies that are trying to keep their DOE grants or get new ones have begun emphasizing Trump’s priorities in their pitches to the administration, according to people familiar with the process who were granted anonymity to discuss it.

In this dialogue, Trump is an audience of one, and his likes and dislikes rule, these sources say.

A possible example of alignment with Trump’s agenda comes from Avangrid, based in Orange, Connecticut. It is subsidiary of Spain’s multinational energy provider the Iberdrola Group, whose development of wind farms launched more two decades-plus of investment energy infrastructure. It operates in 23 U.S. states.

One of Avangrid’s major U.S. projects is a proposed power line in Maine that would connect 1,200 MW of renewable energy to the New England grid. The Biden administration’s DOE promised to purchase a key part of the power flowing through the future line, to a maximum of $425 million, through its Transmission Facilitation Program.

DOE is authorized to make such purchase commitments as an “anchor tenant” to give big competitive transmission projects more market credibility. DOE could resell any power it wound up with, but by the time the lines were built, all the capacity was expected to be purchased by utilities or customers, removing any financial commitment from DOE, planners predicted.

Avangrid’s purchase commitment is not on the DOE target list.

Although it still points out its clean energy investments, its statements this year herald support for data centers, aligning itself with Trump’s agenda.

Announcing the construction start of a solar project in northeast Oregon last month, the company noted it will help power a new data center “to support Meta’s operations.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/52/60/e6db85e2475dbcda9d7b9272a684/climate-wind-energy-40490.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 10:07:10.673985

SLINGERLANDS, N.Y., Oct. 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Plug Power (NASDAQ: PLUG), a global leader in comprehensive hydrogen solutions for the hydrogen economy, announces that CEO Andy Marsh will join U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy (R-LA) and national energy leaders today, Thursday, October 16, 2025, at the Louisiana Energy Security Summit, hosted by the American Council for Capital Formation (ACCF). Attendees are gathering to discuss how U.S. companies are strengthening energy independence and industrial competitiveness through clean hydrogen and domestic manufacturing.

Marsh will participate in the panel “Cracking Down on China — Addressing Risks to American Energy and Supply Chain Security”. The discussion will explore policy and investment strategies that safeguard U.S. manufacturing, reward clean production, and support fair competition in global markets. By combining innovation with strong domestic investment, Plug is proving that the U.S. can compete head-to-head with China, not through subsidies, but through productivity, reliability, and clean-energy excellence.

“America’s energy advantage is its competitive edge,” said Marsh. “By turning that power into hydrogen and liquid fuels here at home, we can out-innovate global competitors, secure supply chains, and build a stronger, cleaner economy. I want to thank Senator Cassidy for his leadership in advancing policies that protect U.S. manufacturers and reward environmental accountability.”

Plug has identified Louisiana as a strategic hub for its expanding hydrogen network. Earlier this year, Plug and Olin Corporation launched Hidrogenii, a 15-ton-per-day liquid hydrogen joint venture in St. Gabriel, one of the Gulf Coast’s first large-scale hydrogen plants. The facility anchors Plug’s vertically integrated hydrogen ecosystem, serving industrial and mobility customers across the Southeast and Gulf regions.

Marsh’s participation underscores Plug’s leadership in building a resilient U.S. hydrogen economy, driving domestic manufacturing, and supporting smart policy measures, such as Senator Cassidy’s Foreign Pollution Fee Act, that create a level playing field for clean, efficient American producers.

“We know the position that we are in today, where we have rising energy demand,” Sommers said. “The real question that I think policymakers are going to have to answer is where is that energy going to come from?”

As U.S. electricity demand is projected to rise more than 40% by 2040 — driven by AI, advanced manufacturing, and population growth — meeting rising demand will depend on the ability to build modern infrastructure.

“We’ve seen it time and time again. Pipelines canceled as a consequence of them no longer being economic because we can’t get them built in a timely manner,” Sommers said. “This is becoming a jobs issue. It’s becoming an economic issue. It’s becoming a consumer issue. And I believe that ultimately, it is about to become a political imperative.”

Through API’s America Builds, America Wins campaign, Sommers outlined concrete steps to unlock the next chapter of energy progress: set deadlines and enforce them; stop lawsuits and start building; and ensure targeted reviews and swift decisions.

Barra also called for a National Zero Emission Vehicle program to help electrify the entire U.S. auto fleet.
The EV push was supercharged during the Biden administration, which introduced tough new emissions standards designed to boost EV sales alongside the EV purchasing tax credit.
In its latest filing, GM said the review of its future EV output is “ongoing” and signaled additional charges could be announced in future quarters.
The entire U.S. auto market also remains challenged by affordability issues.","U.S. automakers are trimming their outlook for electric vehicles amid lingering consumer doubts, a pullback in federal support and a challenging economic landscape that is affecting all auto sales.

On Tuesday, General Motors reported it was taking losses totaling $1.6 billion related to planned changes to its EV rollout. The company attributed some of the change to President Donald Trump’s elimination of the $7,500 in EV purchasing incentives enacted by President Joe Biden. The credit officially expired Sept. 30.

“Following recent U.S. government policy changes, including the termination of certain consumer tax incentives for EV purchases and the reduction in the stringency of emissions regulations, we expect the adoption rate of EVs to slow,” GM said in a filing.

Rival Ford has delayed plans to build out an EV plant in Tennessee. It told Reuters last week it would be “nimble in adjusting our product launch timing to meet market needs and customer demand while targeting improved profitability.”

Plunging sales at Tesla — still the U.S. leader in EV sales — are also contributing to the weakening outlook. Its second-quarter sales dropped almost 13%, and CEO Elon Musk has warned of some “rough quarters” ahead for the company.

The changes threaten to leave the United States behind in what many still consider the future of automobiles. In July 2024, EV sales officially overtook sales of conventional autos in China. There and in nearby countries, the cost of an electric vehicle has been falling more rapidly than in the United States, thanks largely to increased competition from the Chinese manufacturers that now dominate the global EV market. However, other Western countries are also rethinking previous EV commitments, including Canada and the United Kingdom, both of which have signaled relaxing electrification targets, partly in response to new pressures sparked by Trump’s trade war.

The retreats are a turnabout from the heady ambitions for EVs that U.S. automakers signaled less than a decade ago. The highest-profile push came from General Motors CEO Mary Barra, who committed the storied automaker to a “zero emissions” future in 2017.

“No more gas. No more diesel. No more carbon emissions,” she wrote at the time.

But a series of challenges — cost concerns, sluggish adoption and the reversal in support in Washington — has left the U.S. auto industry with greater uncertainty about its EV future.

“Penetration has stalled,” said David Whiston, a senior analyst at Morningstar investment research company who covers autos.

Even before Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” ended the tax credit, signs of resistance to EVs among U.S. consumers had begun to show. A survey published in August 2024 by Edmunds automotive information group showed concerns about finding charging stations and charging times, availability and reliability as the top reasons consumers would not purchase EVs.

“They said they don’t want the hassle or don’t feel like learning something new,” said Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at Edmunds.

In the second quarter of 2025, new EV sales declined by 6.3% year on year, according to Cox Automotive, which said the growth trajectory for EVs “has been curbed.” EV sales got a boost in the third quarter, but analysts said that was most likely the result of the looming expiration of the tax credit.

“The federal tax credit was a key catalyst for EV adoption, and its expiration marks a pivotal moment,” Cox Automotive’s director of industry insights, Stephanie Valdez Streaty, said in a release. “This shift will test whether the electric vehicle market is mature enough to thrive on its own fundamentals or still needs support to expand further.”

For a time, EVs seemed poised to take over the U.S. market. Following the lead of Barra of GM, Ford announced in 2018 that it planned to nearly triple its investments in electric and hybrid vehicles by 2022, with plans for 40 new such models. Barra also called for a National Zero Emission Vehicle program to help electrify the entire U.S. auto fleet.

Meanwhile, sales at Tesla, which exclusively manufactures EVs, began to accelerate, turning the groundbreaking automaker into one of the most valuable companies in the world and giving it a dominant position in the electric market.

The EV push was supercharged during the Biden administration, which introduced tough new emissions standards designed to boost EV sales alongside the EV purchasing tax credit.

But last year, Barra told NBC News that GM’s all-electric future would now play out “over decades,” though the company said it continued to target 2035 to fully electrify its fleet. In its latest filing, GM said the review of its future EV output is “ongoing” and signaled additional charges could be announced in future quarters. A GM spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.

Last month, The Wall Street Journal reported that GM had spent more to lobby the federal government in 2025 to fight clean air and fuel economy rules than any company other than Facebook parent Meta.

“What we’re committed to is the customer,” Barra said about the shift away from EVs at a Wall Street Journal event in May, the paper reported. “The customer was telling us they weren’t ready.”

Ford CEO Jim Farley said this month that EV sales could fall by around 50% after the EV tax credits expire. A Ford spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.

The entire U.S. auto market also remains challenged by affordability issues. The average price of a new car surpassed $50,000 for the first time last month, Kelley Blue Book reported Tuesday. The average monthly auto payment in the United States is now $749 for new vehicles and $529 for used vehicles, according to the credit reporting agency Experian. U.S. households in general continue to struggle with stubborn inflation and an increasingly shaky jobs market, which has left the pace of overall monthly auto sales below pre-pandemic levels.

EVs currently cost about $7,000 more, according to Kelley Blue Book data.

Anna Vanderspek, electric vehicle program director at the Green Energy Consumers Alliance, an environmental advocacy group, said she is hopeful that the global shift toward EVs will eventually rebound to U.S. automakers as they look to stay competitive and thus filter down to U.S. consumers.

But she acknowledged the timetable for adoption has shifted.

“There’s good reason to think that this transition will continue to happen,” she said. “But now it will just happen more slowly.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251014-Taicang-port-in-Suzhou-china-BYD-evs-other-brands-ready-for-export-ac-1053p-20a043.jpg",N,,2025-10-16 07:59:33.336734

Global energy intensity improved by just 1% in 2024, far below the 4% annual gains needed to meet the UAE Consensus goal and keep the 1.5°C target alive.

The report calls for urgent action to:

• integrate renewable targets into national climate plans (NDC 3.0) ahead of COP30 in Belém;

• double collective NDC ambition to align with the global renewables goal; and

• scale investment in renewables to at least USD 1.4 trillion per year in 2025–2030 –- more than doubling the USD 624 billion invested in 2024.

In light of the report findings, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said: “The clean energy revolution is unstoppable. Renewables are deployed faster and cheaper than fossil fuels – driving growth, jobs, and affordable power. But the window to keep the 1.5°C limit within reach is rapidly closing. We must step up, scale up and speed up the just energy transition – for everyone, everywhere.”

Francesco La Camera, Director-General of IRENA added: “The world has broken renewable capacity records, but records alone will not keep 1.5°C alive. Renewables are not just the most cost-effective climate solution; they are the biggest economic opportunity of our time. This report shows the path: accelerate deployment, modernise grids, scale clean-tech and strengthen supply chains. Every dollar invested brings growth, jobs and energy security. As the custodian agency tracking progress toward the global renewables goal, we call for greater ambition. By raising targets, mobilising finance and deepening cooperation, major economies can lead the energy transition and make COP30 a milestone.”

Ben Backwell, Chair of the Global Renewables Alliance, said: “The private sector is driving the energy transition, providing three-quarters of global clean energy investment. Our industries, led by wind, solar and hydropower, are already delivering growth, jobs and security. What we need now are long-term government plans that match national ambitions; we need pipelines that deliver projects. Plans must deliver enabling action on grids and storage and help maximise the benefits of the energy transition. This report shows that the march to renewable energy abundance is underway – and it’s time for us to accelerate.”

The world’s major advanced and emerging economies must take the lead, according to the recommendations of the new report. G20 nations are projected to account for over 80% of global renewables by 2030, with the richest developed economies of the G7 expected to shoulder a leadership role by raising their share to around 20% of global capacity within this decade.

Major global economies must also deliver on climate finance, meeting the USD 300 billion annual floor of the new collective quantified goal (NCQG) and scaling up towards the aspirational USD 1.3 trillion confirmed at COP29 in Azerbaijan.

Beyond renewables, the report underlines the urgent need for investment in grids, supply chains, and clean-tech manufacturing for solar, wind, batteries and hydrogen.

While renewable energy investments grew by 7% in 2024, actual disbursements remain far below the levels required to build robust project pipelines and accelerate construction. As to supply chains, fair and transparent trade practices must be ensured for critical renewable energy technologies and international co-operation pursued to safeguard trade corridors for key materials and components.

Furthermore, strategic investment in modernising and expanding electricity grids is the essential foundation for integrating new capacity and strengthening energy security. Between now and 2030, an estimated USD 670 billion must be directed each year towards grids, with further investment required to rapidly scale up energy storage solutions, facilitate renewable integration and safeguard grid stability.",https://strategicenergy.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/PPAs-are-transforming-the-renewable-energy-sector-in-Portugal.png,N,,2025-10-16 11:13:46.603713

The initiative marks the company’s largest-ever commitment in its 100-year U.S. history and strengthens its position in the race toward electrification and sustainable mobility. Here are 10 key facts about the investment and what it means for the EV market, jobs, and U.S. manufacturing.

Antonio Filosa, Stellantis CEO and North America COO, said: “As we begin our next 100 years, we are putting the customer at the center of our strategy, expanding our vehicle offerings and giving them the freedom to choose the products they want and love.”

1. Stellantis Commits $13 Billion Over Four Years

Stellantis will invest $13 billion between 2025 and 2029 to expand its U.S. operations, focusing on electric and hybrid vehicle production, new powertrains, and advanced manufacturing capabilities. This is the company’s biggest U.S. investment ever.

2. Focus on Electric and Hybrid Vehicles

A significant portion of the investment targets EV and range-extended hybrid vehicle development. Stellantis plans to launch an all-new range-extended electric SUV at the Warren Truck Assembly Plant in Michigan by 2028—reinforcing its EV roadmap under the Dare Forward 2030 strategy.

3. Five New Models for the U.S. Market

The company will roll out five brand-new models across Jeep, Dodge, and other Stellantis brands. These models will include next-generation EVs and electrified SUVs designed to compete in high-demand American segments.

4. 5,000 New Jobs Across Four States

The investment will create over 5,000 new jobs in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana, strengthening Stellantis’ manufacturing footprint and supporting local economies tied to the clean mobility transition.

5. Illinois Plant to Produce Electric Jeeps

Stellantis will reopen the Belvidere Assembly Plant in Illinois with a $600 million investment to produce Jeep Cherokee and Jeep Compass models, expected to include electric and hybrid variants. The reopening will create around 3,300 jobs and revive a key facility that was shuttered in 2023.

6. Michigan to Host a New Range-Extended EV SUV

In Michigan, the automaker will retool its Warren Truck Assembly Plant with nearly $100 million to produce a large range-extended electric SUV starting in 2028—adding about 900 jobs. This underscores Stellantis’ commitment to electrified SUVs, one of the fastest-growing automotive categories.

7. Indiana to Build the New Four-Cylinder EV-Capable Engine

Indiana will produce the GMET4 EVO, a next-generation four-cylinder engine optimized for both traditional and electrified powertrains. This $100 million investment ensures the U.S. remains a key base for Stellantis’ future hybrid and EV components.

8. Toledo to Build a New Midsize Truck

In Ohio, Stellantis will invest $400 million to produce a new midsize truck, possibly featuring electrified variants, at the Toledo Assembly Complex, where the Jeep Wrangler 4xe (a leading plug-in hybrid SUV) is already manufactured.

9. Strategic Move Amid U.S. Tariffs

The investment may also serve to mitigate the impact of U.S. tariffs on imported vehicles. By localizing EV and hybrid production, Stellantis can reduce costs and maintain competitiveness in its critical North American market.

10. Strengthening Stellantis’ EV Strategy in the U.S.

This expansion supports Stellantis’ Dare Forward 2030 vision, which targets 50 percent EV sales in North America by 2030. The new plants and product launches position the company to better compete with Tesla, GM, Ford, and BYD in the growing U.S. EV market.

Earlier, Stellantis announced that it is accelerating its transition to electric mobility through its “Dare Forward 2030” strategy. The company targets 100 percent battery-electric sales in Europe and 50 percent in the U.S. by 2030, with plans to launch 75 BEV models across brands such as Jeep, Fiat, Peugeot, and Dodge. It aims to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2038.

To support this shift, Stellantis is investing over €30 billion by 2025 in electrification and software development. Its expanding EV lineup includes the Jeep Recon, Wagoneer S, Fiat 500e, Peugeot e-208, and Ram 1500 REV. The company is also establishing five gigafactories in Europe and North America to secure battery supply for its growing range of electric vehicles.",https://greentechlead.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Stellantis-EV-Michigan-facility.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 11:17:49.677378

Cybertruck was well on its way to flop status before these sales numbers.
Still, the vehicle’s third-quarter performance is particularly damning in comparison to nationwide EV sales, where the tax credit’s demise ignited a fire sale.
Those two vehicles remained the two best-selling EVs in America, with Tesla selling more than 114,000 Model Ys and more than 53,000 Model 3s.
Now that Cybertruck has become Elon’s Edsel, Tesla’s hopes for an EV sales revival lie largely with the new “Standard” versions of its two best-sellers.","Americans certainly got the message about the end of the EV tax credit. With the $7,500 benefit set to disappear at the end of September, electric vehicle sales surged to record numbers in the third quarter of 2025 as buyers raced to beat the deadline.

The rising tide lifted just about all EVs — but not the struggling Tesla Cybertruck. According to new numbers from Kelley Blue Book, Tesla sold just 5,385 Cybertrucks from July to September, less than half as many as it delivered during the same period in 2024. The company is now expected to sell around 20,000 of the metal EVs this calendar year. That’s down from around 50,000 last year, and less than 10% of the 250,000 total Elon Musk once predicted as the truck’s annual sales figure.

Cybertruck was well on its way to flop status before these sales numbers. With its purposefully jarring aesthetic, the EV for edgelords was never going to be as popular as Musk proclaimed, and that was before his relationship to Donald Trump and online provocations pushed many more people away from the Tesla brand. Cost didn’t help, either. Tesla once said it would sell a $40,000 basic version of Cybertruck, a price point that might have enticed some buyers beyond the Musk fanboys who became early adopters, but the cheapest one you can actually buy today is around $60,000.

Still, the vehicle’s third-quarter performance is particularly damning in comparison to nationwide EV sales, where the tax credit’s demise ignited a fire sale. Americans bought more than 430,000 EVs during the quarter, an increase of about 40% from the second quarter of 2025 and about 30% from the third quarter of last year. Popular vehicles including the Chevy Equinox EV, Hyundai Ioniq 5, Ford Mustang Mach-E, and Honda Prologue surged to sales of more than 20,000 during the quarter. Electric trucks including the Rivian R1T, Ford F-150 Lightning, and GMC Hummer EV saw sales increases despite having high prices that rival the Cybertruck’s.

Tesla itself, despite months of bad press, did well, too. The brand’s share of the overall EV market continues to wane, reaching a new low of 41%. But the surge temporarily stabilized its tumbling sales, with plenty of people snatching up Model 3s and Model Ys while the getting was good. Those two vehicles remained the two best-selling EVs in America, with Tesla selling more than 114,000 Model Ys and more than 53,000 Model 3s.

Yet the good times did nothing to spur driver interest in Cybertruck. In fact, public enthusiasm for the vehicle might be even lower than it seems, because it turns out that one of the top customers for Musk’s electric tank is Musk himself. Electrek reports that his other companies, such as SpaceX and xAI, have been accumulating Cybertrucks as their company cars. Tesla is replacing some of its own fleet with Cybertrucks, as well.

The move makes sense for Musk. Because of weak overall demand, Cybertrucks are sitting idle on lots; selling them to his businesses at least puts them to work. The scheme also might improve the appearance of Tesla’s sales numbers, Electrek speculates. By locking in some of these sales with a downpayment before the end of September, Tesla can deliver Cybertrucks to Musk’s other business in the weeks to come and still get the tax credit on them. The approach could boost sales numbers for a fourth quarter that’s likely to be difficult with the disappearance of the federal incentive.

Now that Cybertruck has become Elon’s Edsel, Tesla’s hopes for an EV sales revival lie largely with the new “Standard” versions of its two best-sellers. These trim levels strip away some of the amenities from the Models 3 and Y to bring their starting prices down to $37,000 and $40,000, respectively. It’s far from clear that this will succeed. Anyone shopping for an EV solely on price could wait for the upcoming new versions of the Nissan Leaf and Chevy Bolt, which are expected to come in at $30,000 or less. The Equinox’s $35,000 starting price, five-grand less than even the budget Model Y crossover, has spurred its recent success.

Still, with 320-plus miles of estimated range and at least some of Tesla’s best features, the budget versions could be compelling cars at those prices. At the very least, they’ll speak to more drivers than the Cybertruck does.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTc1NTY1NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTgwNjk3MTA0OH0.ZiBrkrbxuXdBl0oB6RzDxyNLXOJL8NHI3haFkBvZtmY/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-10-16 11:17:02.855454

A new report from the group Clean Energy Economy Minnesota showed 2024 was another banner year, with nearly 64,000 people working in renewable energy fields. The job growth rate for people doing things like installing solar panels was twice that of the state’s overall workforce. However, the numbers do not factor in more recent moves by the Trump administration and Congressional Republicans to unravel federal incentives.

Cathy Liebowitz, senior manager of membership engagement for the group, said given the major policy shift, they cannot guarantee some jobs will stick around, although it does not mean the wheels are falling off, either.

“We are not predicting that record-breaking growth in the following year,” Liebowitz acknowledged. “But we’re also not predicting significant reversals.”",https://media-cdn.socastsrm.com/wordpress/wp-content/blogs.dir/2404/files/2025/10/adobestock-328673896-1.jpeg,N,,2025-10-16 11:13:51.617302

The move looks set to reshape sourcing and supplier relationships as the automaker counters disruption from US President Donald Trump’s tariffs, which are already impacting competitors’ manufacturing and supply chains.

Antonio Filosa, CEO at Stellantis, says the plan supports a customer-first approach and ensures Stellantis strengthens its position in one of its most important global markets.

""This investment in the US – the single largest in the company’s history – will drive our growth, strengthen our manufacturing footprint and bring more American jobs to the states we call home,"" he says.

""Accelerating growth in the US has been a top priority since my first day. Success in America is not just good for Stellantis in the US – it makes us stronger everywhere.""

Impact on sourcing and supply

The US$13bn programme is the largest in the company’s 100-year US history.

Stellantis is targeting a 50% uplift in annual vehicle production and the creation of more than 5,000 jobs across Illinois, Ohio, Michigan and Indiana. It is funding five all-new vehicle launches in key categories, a full new four-cylinder engine and ongoing powertrain updates.

Nineteen refreshed models are scheduled across the US assembly network through to 2029.

For procurement, this unlocks multi-year waves of capex sourcing for plant retooling, automation, dies and moulds, test equipment, as well as serial production awards for engines, driveline, chassis, body, interiors, electronics and software-enabled features.

Volume ramp-ups require strategic material strategies across steel, aluminium, polymers and semiconductors, alongside capacity assurance with tier-1 and tier-2s.

Localisation as a tariff shield

The strategy doubles down on domestic manufacturing to mitigate tariff exposure and logistics risk.

With 34 US sites across 14 states and a network of more than 48,000 employees, 2,600 dealers and almost 2,300 suppliers, Stellantis is using local content and shorter supply lines to protect cost, service and speed to market.

The expectation is that localisation clauses, origin tracking and revised terms wll feature in new contracts as the company balances internal combustion and electrified portfolios.

Illinois: Belvidere reboot

Stellantis will invest more than US600m to reopen Belvidere Assembly in 2027, focused on Jeep Cherokee and Jeep Compass for the US market, creating 3,300 jobs.

The restart anchors a regional Jeep footprint and will drive fresh RFQs for final assembly tooling, supplier park services and inbound logistics.

The investment also supports expanded R&D tied to the broader plan, signalling demand for engineering services and prototype parts.

Ohio: Midsize truck shift concentrates know-how in Toledo

Nearly US$400m is going to the Toledo Assembly Complex to build an all-new midsize truck from 2028, moved from Illinois to sit with Jeep Wrangler and Gladiator.

The model, previously designated for Illinois, has been shifted to the Toledo Assembly Complex where it will sit alongside the Jeep Wrangler and Jeep Gladiator.

Production is expected to launch in 2028, with Stellantis estimating the move will create more than 900 new jobs.

Michigan & Indiana: Flexible supply

Two moves reshape Michigan sourcing. Warren Truck Assembly will be retooled to produce a range-extended EV and an ICE large SUV from 2028 with a US$100m investment and 900 plus roles.

Stellantis has confirmed a US$130m investment to prepare the Detroit Assembly Complex – Jefferson for the next-generation Dodge Durango launching in 2029.

Continuity for legacy lines alongside new alternatives means procurement will juggle end-of-life buys with ramp plans to avoid obsolescence and service gaps.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/e5dd6c2b1878f81371cd7ef570e793d8:6f5243ae9d2c7e2f499f86d24da4f666/gettyimages-2177457677.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 09:00:09.533301

Should You Invest $1,000 in General Motors Right Now?
Before you consider General Motors, you'll want to hear this.
While General Motors currently has a Moderate Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.","General Motors NYSE: GM announced on Oct. 14 that it will take a significant $1.6 billion charge in its third-quarter earnings report results, a move directly tied to a strategic realignment of its electric vehicle (EV) production plans. On the surface, a billion-dollar write-down often signals trouble, and the news caused initial hesitation among investors.

However, the story runs much deeper for a company trading at a modest nine times trailing earnings with a steady 1.05% dividend yield.

This move is not a sign of failure but a display of proactive leadership, adapting to a fluid market. Investors should consider this a hallmark of a resilient and well-run company. While the headline number is substantial, the logic behind it suggests a disciplined pivot toward profitability that benefits shareholders in the long run.

For investors, understanding the reason behind this charge is key to recognizing the opportunity this strategy change presents.

A Strategic Retreat: Prioritizing Profit Over Production

The $1.6 billion charge is a calculated business decision, not an unexpected loss. The figure has two main components: a non-cash impairment of approximately $1.2 billion for underutilized EV-related assets and about $400 million in cash costs to exit specific supplier contracts.

This action directly and logically responds to two key market shifts impacting the entire auto industry. First, the rapid, government-incentivized growth in EV adoption has begun to moderate to a more sustainable, albeit slower, pace.

Second, the expiration of federal EV tax credits had removed a significant purchasing incentive for many consumers in the near term.

Faced with these realities, GM is choosing fiscal discipline over blind ambition. Instead of building vehicles at a loss simply to meet previous volume targets, the company is adjusting its production schedule to match actual consumer demand.

This strategic pivot prevents the costly mistake of overproducing vehicles that could end up sitting on lots, eroding margins and tying up valuable cash. By taking this charge now, GM is effectively prioritizing the long-term profitability of its EV division over short-term production numbers.

The ICE Business Powering the Pivot

General Motors' ability to make such a significant strategic adjustment in its emerging EV business is underwritten by its core operations' immense and consistent power. The company's portfolio of traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles remains dominant, generating the cash flow needed to fund its future and reward its shareholders. The strength of this profit engine was on full display in the most recent sales data.

Powerful Sales Momentum: In the third quarter, GM's U.S. vehicle sales surged by 8% year-over-year. Through the first nine months of 2025, sales are up 10% to 2.2 million vehicles, demonstrating powerful and sustained consumer demand.

Dominance in High-Margin Segments: GM continues its decades-long reign in the most profitable corners of the auto market. It is on track to lead the U.S. full-size pickup market for the sixth consecutive year, commanding roughly 40% of the market. Its leadership in the full-size SUV segment is even more pronounced, where it is poised to top the market for an incredible 51st consecutive year with approximately 60% market share.

Broad-Based Brand Strength: This success is not limited to trucks. Buick was the fastest-growing mainstream brand through the first three quarters, and Cadillac recorded its best Q3 sales since 2013.

Building Value Through Discipline and Partnerships

This pivot toward EV profitability is part of a broader corporate strategy focused on fiscal discipline and efficient growth. This is evident not only in how the company is managing its EV transition but also in how it deploys capital globally and returns it to shareholders.

In a forward-thinking move demonstrating capital efficiency, GM recently partnered with Hyundai to co-develop five new vehicles for key markets in the Americas. This collaboration allows both automakers to share development costs and platforms, targeting a combined 800,000 annual vehicle sales once fully scaled. This is an innovative, low-cost strategy to expand market presence.

This operational excellence extends to challenging international markets. In China, GM's joint ventures saw sales increase by 10.1% in Q3, driven by a popular NEV lineup. This success proves the company can compete and win where many rivals have stumbled.

This global profitability translates directly into shareholder value. Management is signaling strong confidence in the company's earnings power by actively returning capital through an ongoing share repurchase program with $4.3 billion in remaining authorization and a consistent, recently increased quarterly dividend.

Opportunity in the Oversell: Why GM's Stock Looks Attractive Now

For investors, the $1.6 billion charge should be viewed not as a liability, but as an investment in a more efficient and profitable future. GM is carefully tuning its EV growth engine for the long haul, powered by the immense cash flow of its ICE business.

This disciplined approach strengthens the company's financial resilience. GM’s analyst community appears to be recognizing this, with analysts at Evercore ISI recently raising their price target on GM stock to $68. Investors should look for further confirmation of this underlying strength during the company's third-quarter earnings call on Oct. 21.

Key items to monitor are the company's full-year guidance, commentary on EBIT-adjusted margins, and the outlook for adjusted automotive free cash flow.

The market's short-term focus on the headline charge may obscure the business's long-term strength, creating what appears to be a compelling entry point for those with a long-term investment horizon.

Abu Dhabi is home to the world’s second-largest dugong population after Australia, which feeds exclusively on seagrass. This makes protecting, conserving, and developing seagrass meadows vital for their survival.

The project has successfully planted 10,000 square metres of seaweed, capable of storing 52 tonnes of carbon, equivalent to 23 flights from Abu Dhabi to London, in alignment with the “2030 Seagrass Breakthrough of the UN Ocean Decade of Ocean Science”. It relies on the use of the most widespread seagrass species in the emirate, ‘Halodule uninervis’, and incorporates the latest technology and innovations for post-cropping monitoring and follow-up.

Since 1999, TotalEnergies has partnered with EAD to protect Abu Dhabi’s ecosystems – supporting dugong conservation, protecting flamingo habitats, conducting research on coastal resilience to climate change, and promoting biodiversity research at Al Wathba. Their work promotes initiatives focused on nature-based solutions, improving soil and air quality in mangrove forests, seagrass and salt marshes. A key outcome is the dugong and Seagrass Research Toolkit, now used in over 40 dugong and 80 seagrass range states.

Samir Oumer, President TotalEnergies EP UAE and TotalEnergies Country Chair, said: “Our collaboration with the Environment Agency – Abu Dhabi (EAD) reflects our deep commitment to marine biodiversity and ecosystem restoration. The dugong and seagrass restoration project is a cornerstone of this partnership, aiming to rehabilitate vital coastal habitats and ensure the long-term survival of dugong populations. Through targeted conservation efforts, habitat restoration, and community engagement, we are working to reverse the decline of these critical ecosystems. This initiative not only supports biodiversity but also strengthens the resilience of coastal communities that depend on healthy marine environments.”

The Environment Agency – Abu Dhabi will also host, for the first time in the Middle East, the 16th International Seagrass Biology Workshop (ISBW) and the World Seagrass Congress in 2026.

The announcement was made by the World Seagrass Association (WSA) and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) at the end of August 2024. This event will serve as a platform that brings together governments, scientists, researchers, and specialists in coastal and marine environments, highlighting global seagrass issues, enhancing our knowledge about them, while also developing support and protection networks.",https://www.mediaoffice.abudhabi/assets/resized/sm/upload/p1/rq/ti/vx/Thumb-0-0-0-0.webp?k=74d388eb2a,N,,2025-10-16 11:14:54.092358

The move came amid rising tensions in EU–China trade relations, with Brussels accusing Beijing of distorting global competition through heavy state support. Since then, the issue has only intensified. China has filed a formal complaint at the World Trade Organization, threatened retaliatory measures on European wine and dairy products, and EU member states remain divided over whether the tariffs should be softened or upheld. With the important global summit COP 30 approaching, Europe has a chance to show whether it will lead the green transition through cooperation or undermine its own decarbonisation goal with the trade barriers. The decision has sparked a heated debate across Europe: is the EU defending fair competition or jeopardizing its own green transition?

Europe is sabotaging its own climate goals, because it is prioritizing the protection of its car industry over allowing affordable Chinese electric vehicles. It turns the green transition into a trade fight with China and risks slowing the green transformation it urgently needs.

Europe doesn’t need a trade war, it needs a strategy. Instead of raising tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, the EU should establish a Green Trade Truce based on transparency, cooperation and fair competition. Brussels could invite Chinese and European producers to adhere to strict and verifiable standards on battery carbon footprints and recycled material content. In exchange, tariffs could be reduced for companies that comply. This approach would protect Europe’s interests, maintain affordable EVs for consumers, and advance climate goals.

The Commission’s new duties on Chinese EVs are trying to protect European industry from unfair subsidies and overcapacity. However, they may have the opposite effect by slowing electrification and raising costs for households. Chinese models are often 20–30 percent cheaper and are more advanced, not only because of state support. Over the past decade, China has built a tightly integrated EV ecosystem, due to their battery manufacturing, refining key materials like lithium and scaling production quickly. Furthermore, its carmakers benefit from strong domestic demand, lower labour costs, and direct access to the entire supply chain. Europe in contrast faces fragmented production, higher energy costs and a complex regulatory framework, which makes it hard to compete. Even tough tariffs may temporarily hide these weaknesses, but they do not address the underlying issues.

The irony is that Europe’s challenge is not insufficient protection, but to be innovative and be proactive. Approving new gigafactories can take years and the charging infrastructure remains underdeveloped in many areas, like Hungary or Ireland. Additionally, the high power prices for the industry in comparison to the U.S. or China, makes It difficult to match the prices. Tariffs will not fix any of these bottlenecks. A smarter policy would focus on accelerating domestic competitiveness. With faster approvals, cheaper green power and coordinated incentives for battery innovation. This approach has proven effective elsewhere: China’s rise in the EV sector was built on clear industrial targets, massive R&D support, and scale-oriented subsidies, while the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act shows how targeted incentives can mobilize private investment. Europe can succeed the same way, by designing incentives that reward innovation and scale, rather than defaulting to protectionism.

Of course, Europe shouldn’t just accept unfair trade, because Chinese EV makers benefit from extensive state subsidies, cheap credits, and below-market access to raw materials, which gives them an artificial cost advantage that undermines free competition. That is precisely what the Commission’s 2023 anti-subsidy probe wants to address. If the Commission can prove that certain Chinese carmakers benefit from heavy state subsidies, then a measured response with for example targeted tariffs is a legitimate option. However, just using duties on every import is a naïve weapon, which invites retaliation, disrupts global supply chains, and undermines Europe’s image as a defender of fair and open trade. Moreover, it exposes a double standard: Europe wants to claim climate leadership and demands global cooperation on carbon reduction, yet at the same time uses tariffs on affordable electric cars from China, which reduces their availability and slows EV adoption.

An approach which prioritizes standards would turn Europe’s regulatory strength into a competitive advantage. Without protectionism Brussels can raise the bar for everyone with transparent rules for battery sourcing and recyclability. Countries that meet those rules can access the European market freely; those that don’t would face penalties based on measurable environmental criteria. This model rewards innovation and compliance rather than political leverage and supports the desired climate goals.",https://katoikos.world/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Picture-1-e1760604177570.png,N,,2025-10-16 11:13:08.150789

Stellantis is making a decisive move to strengthen its presence in the US auto market, committing $13 billion to expand its domestic production footprint. The investment is the largest in the company’s 100-year US history and reflects a strategic bet on American manufacturing as the industry enters a pivotal phase of transformation.

The four-year plan includes five new vehicle launches, 19 refreshed models and the creation of more than 5,000 jobs across facilities in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan and Indiana. Stellantis expects to boost annual vehicle production in the US by 50 percent, reinforcing its long-term strategy to compete in high-demand segments and deliver new technologies to market.

Jeep factory reopens in Illinois

A centerpiece of the plan is the reopening of the Belvidere, Illinois, plant. Once idled in 2023, the facility will resume production with two key Jeep models, the Cherokee and Compass, beginning in 2027. The Jeep factory reopening will create about 3,300 jobs and signals a renewed commitment to domestic assembly.

In addition, the Toledo, Ohio, plant will receive nearly $400 million to support the production of a new midsize truck. Originally designated for Belvidere, the program has been reassigned to Toledo, where the Jeep Wrangler and Gladiator are currently built. Stellantis says the investment will generate more than 900 jobs at the complex.

EV and engine production expands

The company is also preparing for a more electrified product line. In Warren, Michigan, Stellantis plans to retool its plant to build a large SUV powered by both a range-extended electric system and a traditional internal combustion engine. Production is expected to begin in 2028 and add more than 900 jobs. In Detroit, the company will invest $130 million to launch the next-generation Dodge Durango by 2029.

In Indiana, more than $100 million will go toward expanding Stellantis’ powertrain output. The Kokomo facilities will become the production hub for the new GMET4 EVO four-cylinder engine starting in 2026. The expansion is expected to create over 100 jobs and anchor Indiana’s role in advanced engine manufacturing.

A shift in US car manufacturing

This move by Stellantis reflects a growing trend in US car manufacturing growth. As automakers respond to shifting consumer preferences and federal incentives, domestic investment is becoming critical to long-term competitiveness. The US electric vehicle market is expanding, and companies like Stellantis are adopting flexible production strategies that support both electric and gasoline-powered models.

The $13 billion Stellantis US investment is not only a show of confidence in American manufacturing, it is also a response to rising pressure to localize production. As federal policies reward homegrown development, Stellantis appears well positioned to lead the next phase of automotive growth.

Trump said Wednesday that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had personally assured him his country would stop buying Russian oil, in a move that might add to pressure on Moscow to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine.

“There will be no oil. He’s not buying oil,” Trump said. The change won’t take immediately, he said, but “within a short period of time.”

India is the second biggest buyer of Russian oil after China. Trump cited its purchases from Moscow when he announced 50% tariffs on imports from India in August.

A statement Thursday by India’s foreign ministry did not address Trump’s remarks directly. It said the government’s consistent priority was to safeguard the interests of Indian consumers in a volatile energy environment.

“Ensuring stable energy prices and secured supplies have been the twin goals of our energy policy. This includes broad basing our energy sourcing and diversifying as appropriate to meet market conditions,” said Randhir Jaiswal, a ministry spokesman.

He said the Trump administration had shown interest in deepening energy cooperation and talks on that were underway.

Expanding India’s energy dealings with the U.S. could help India mitigate supply disruptions and align with Washington’s push to reduce global dependence on Russian oil.

India’s Trade Secretary Rajesh Agarwal said Wednesday that India was willing to increase its purchases of American oil and natural gas if prices were competitive.

Agarwal told reporters India has been buying around $12-$13 billion worth of crude oil and gas from the U.S. annually and there was room to nearly double that without causing disruptions for Indian refiners.

A team of Indian government officials was visiting the U.S. to discuss a bilateral trade agreement that includes energy cooperation, he said.

“In discussions we are in, we have indicated very positively that India as a country would like to diversify its portfolio as far as energy imports are concerned. That’s the best strategy for a big buyer like India,” said Agarwal.

In February, Modi and Trump set a target of finalizing the first tranche of a trade agreement by autumn. Talks were suspended after five formal rounds of negotiations after Trump expressed displeasure over India’s continued purchases of Russian oil. He said that was helping to fuel Moscow’s war against Ukraine.

Trump has been frustrated by his inability to force an end to the war in Ukraine, which began with Russia’s invasion almost four years ago. He’s expressed dissatisfaction with Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom he increasingly describes as the primary obstacle to a resolution, and he’s scheduled to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday.

In recent weeks, Modi has engaged positively on Trump’s social media posts, including the one about first stage of a peace deal between Israel and Hamas, suggesting New Delhi is keen to expand cooperation with the U.S. In turn, Trump called Modi his “friend” and wished him well on his birthday last month.",https://www.greenfieldreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/preview-1190.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 06:59:45.859443

AI data centers, which depend on GPUs and other advanced computing systems for processing, require far more electricity than traditional facilities.","Pennsylvania is positioning itself as a rising contender in the competitive race for AI data centers. With its abundant natural gas reserves and strategic location, the state is pursuing an ambitious $70 billion initiative to attract major data center investments and transform its economic landscape.

Announced in July at the Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit, held at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, the plan includes a series of high-profile projects aimed at bolstering infrastructure and energy capacity. Unlike federally backed efforts such as the CHIPS Act, Pennsylvania's initiative relies entirely on state-level coordination and private investment.

A Comprehensive Infrastructure Approach

Pennsylvania’s initiative supports a wide range of projects tied to data center operations. These efforts include supplying energy to data centers, enhancing the power grid, and training workers for industry demands. Interestingly, direct investments in data centers themselves are a smaller portion of the plan. The majority of the projects focus on improving power delivery, which has bottlenecked data center expansion and construction.

Pennsylvania’s Energy Advantage

Pennsylvania’s energy resources play a key role in its strategy to attract data center investments. The state is rich in coal and natural gas, with natural gas as the largest source of in-state electricity generation, according to the US Energy Information Administration.

Pennsylvania’s location atop the Appalachian Basin, home to some of the nation’s richest shale gas reservoirs, further strengthens its energy profile. The state is the second-largest natural gas producer in the United States, trailing only Texas, and ranks as the third-largest coal-producing state, following Wyoming and West Virginia.

These abundant energy resources position Pennsylvania as a prime location for power-hungry AI data centers.

Major Projects and Investments

The state has secured commitments from major technology companies and investors across multiple high-value projects.

One of Pennsylvania’s most ambitious projects under the $70 billion initiative is converting an abandoned Aliquippa, Pa., steel mill into a high-density data center complex. This $25 billion redevelopment effort is backed by investment giant Blackstone, which is also partnering with PPL Corp. in a joint venture focused on power generation. Additionally, CoreWeave announced a $6 billion investment to develop a data center with up to 300 MW of capacity in Lancaster, Pa., representing one of the largest single data center investments in the region. Energy Capital Partners also announced a $5 billion plan to build a data center at the York II Energy Center in Delta, Pa.

Google has committed to a 20-year deal with New York-based Brookfield Asset Management to repower two Pennsylvania hydropower facilities – Safe Harbor Hydro Facility and Holtwood Hydro Facility – resulting in 670 MW of power generation. Meanwhile, PA Data Center Partners and Powerhouse Data Centers revealed a $15 billion plan to develop a three-campus data center hub near Carlisle, Pa., with a total capacity of 1.3 GW.

Beyond infrastructure, the initiative includes workforce development through the Energy Innovation Center Infrastructure Academy, a first-of-its-kind regional training facility for energy and AI infrastructure workers. Meta has also joined the effort with a $2.5 million investment in partnership with the Schwartz Center for Entrepreneurship at Carnegie Mellon University to support rural Pennsylvania startups, along with community accelerator training for small businesses.

Meeting AI’s Massive Power Demand

Pennsylvania emphasizes its ability to meet the substantial energy demands of AI data centers. AI data centers, which depend on GPUs and other advanced computing systems for processing, require far more electricity than traditional facilities. Pennsylvania’s natural gas reserves provide a reliable energy supply and offer cost advantages compared to other states reliant on renewable energy or imported resources.

Industry analysts see Pennsylvania’s approach as game-changing. “Many states like Virginia, Oregon, and Texas have created incentive programs, but the number of recent announcements in Pennsylvania … is unprecedented,” said Alvin Nguyen, Senior Analyst with Forrester Research. “They have made an impressive push.”

Nguyen highlighted Pennsylvania’s advantages, including ample land, abundant water resources, and a skilled workforce, making it an ideal location for AI data centers and factories. “Pennsylvania’s push can definitely take away business from Northern Virginia and other existing data center markets,” he noted.

Overcoming Historical Challenges

The transformation represents a dramatic shift for a state once overlooked by the data center industry. Bob Ricci, President of DVM Power + Control, a West Chester, Pa.-based infrastructure supplier for data centers, explained that Pennsylvania was not considered ideal for data centers due in part to high utility costs. “Recently, because of the amount of natural gas and utility available in the state, it's become sort of a statewide effort to … develop data centers,” he said.

Ricci noted the bipartisan appeal of Pennsylvania’s potential billions in data center construction. Pennsylvania mirrors Texas by using abundant energy resources to create jobs and attract businesses. “[Pennsylvania] is really leveraging that energy supply to create great jobs and bring businesses in,” Ricci said.

The Power of State-Level Support

Data center operators are particularly enthusiastic about Pennsylvania’s coordinated state-level approach. Joe Minarik, COO of DataBank, a Dallas-based data center operator, cited the benefits of state-level support for these initiatives. Typically, data center operators work with municipalities to secure incentives – a complex and time-consuming process. Pennsylvania’s statewide effort simplifies this. “When you have the state backing it, it really helps get through those regulatory hurdles a lot better,” Minarik said.

Minarik emphasized the need for collaboration between municipalities and state governments in data center projects. “You need the local support to manage through it, because that's where a lot of the constituents are that are going to want to know what's going on in their community,” he said.

He also noted the state’s critical role in managing power distribution from major plants. “You need the state to back it, because that's where a lot of the distribution levels come in at the larger power [plants]. … You need both to be able to work hand in hand,” he explained.

Minarik praised Pennsylvania’s approach: “I like the idea of what they're doing. I think it'll bring a lot of ease of doing business through efforts for the local government.”",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt8eb3cdfc1fce5194/bltdeb2bf64da3922b3/68f015922cba580bc92cfe38/battery_icon_charging_on_an_abstract_tech_background.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-16 07:59:50.928970

The cap is lower when it’s hot out because power lines can easily overheat; conversely, power lines can carry more electricity when it’s cold or windy.
Those assumptions can result in a fixed rating for how much power a transmission line can handle without overheating.
While hurricane-force gusts are damaging to power lines, a moderate breeze can cool them enough to increase how much power they can carry.
The software combines terrain maps around power lines with detailed weather forecasts and utilizes artificial intelligence to predict the temperature of transmission lines.","The U.S. power grid has an efficiency problem. But software upgrades and introducing specialized data could provide relief to strained and congested power lines, according to a new study from the company Gridraven.

The transmission lines that connect generation resources like wind farms and power plants to cities and suburbs are limited by the maximum amount of electricity they can carry. That capacity often depends on the weather. The cap is lower when it’s hot out because power lines can easily overheat; conversely, power lines can carry more electricity when it’s cold or windy.

Gridraven has offices in Estonia and Austin, Texas, and the company’s team is composed of software engineers and weather data scientists. In an interview with Straight Arrow News, Gridraven CEO Georg Rute said, “we help existing power lines carry more energy.”

In a report released Tuesday, the company examined the effects of applying Gridraven software known as Claw to a transmission line in South Texas. The report found Claw software could have allowed 30% more power to flow through the transmission line and saved ratepayers about $2.5 million over the summer months, the company said.

Gridraven is one of several companies at the forefront of Dynamic Line Rating (DLR), the name for optimizing how much power can be sent through transmission lines based on changing weather conditions. As electricity demand increases, energy analysts are looking to solutions beyond building new power plants. DLR has emerged as a promising technology for increasing the gird’s capacity, potentially saving consumers money at a time when utility bills are going up.

How can dynamic line rating help the grid?

A 2019 U.S. Department of Energy study described how grid operators typically make a series of “conservative assumptions” to determine how much power they can send through transmission lines. Those assumptions can result in a fixed rating for how much power a transmission line can handle without overheating.

DLR software works by integrating weather forecasts and adjusting line ratings. Gridraven uses software only, but some DLR solutions involve adding sensors to power lines.

The company focuses on wind. While hurricane-force gusts are damaging to power lines, a moderate breeze can cool them enough to increase how much power they can carry.

“If you have a hot wire, then it’s cooled twice as much if there’s a bit of wind,” Rute said.

Fixed line ratings become a problem for the grid when the amount of power generated exceeds a transmission line’s limit, and power is wasted. In Texas, lower-cost power sources — often wind and solar — are curtailed when transmission lines reach capacity, but the additional power may still be needed. To keep supply steady, a power plant somewhere else in the state will ramp up and send power through a non-congested line.

On the grid run by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), congestion costs from turning on expensive power sources while cheaper ones are curtailed adds up to between $1 and $2 billion annually. Utility companies generally pass congestion costs on to ratepayers.

Although DLR cannot eliminate congestion, especially in hot conditions, proponents of grid enhancing technology say it can spot when curtailment is truly necessary, versus when it’s based on assumptions that do not reflect actual weather conditions.

In many cases, Rute said, “there’s actually more capacity in that line, so there is no congestion, therefore the prices can be evened out.”

A 2025 pre-print study from researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology simulated the effects of DLR on the Texas grid. The study found that the average transmission capacity on the entire grid could increase by 43% in the summer and 52% in the winter by utilizing DLR on only the most thermally constrained power lines.

How does Gridraven’s software work?

While the MIT researchers’ results are based on a system-wide simulation, Gridraven’s new study simulates the effects of its software on one congested transmission line southeast of San Antonio.

The Gridraven Claw uses satellite data and LIDAR scans from the U.S. Geological Survey to create detailed 3D terrain maps. Rute said the system accounts for every tree, building and landscape feature that affects wind patterns at a local level.

The software combines terrain maps around power lines with detailed weather forecasts and utilizes artificial intelligence to predict the temperature of transmission lines.

“Grid operators need to have full resolution about what the wind is doing everywhere on the lines before they can push more [power] through,” Rute said.

And Gridraven’s innovation is allowing grid operators to do this without making any physical changes to power lines.

Several companies are actively deploying DLR technology in the U.S.

Heimdall Power has a software platform; the company also uses drones to install sensors on power lines. The company deployed these sensors on the grid run by an electric cooperative in Minnesota, and found that it increased transmission capacity by 63% during peak power demand, according to a company white paper.

Massachusetts-based LineVision uses LIDAR sensors installed on transmission towers to gather real-time data. That data is combined with AI and weather forecasts. The company said deployment of 42 sensors in Indiana and Ohio helped yield a 40% increase in transmission capacity.

What are the barriers to adopting dynamic line rating?

Rute told SAN he anticipates that incentivizing utility companies to adopt DLR will be the primary barrier to growth.

“[Utilities] don’t have congestion costs on their balance sheet,” Rute said.

Instead, those costs are passed to consumers, so in most cases, installing a DLR solution will not directly lead to increased utility company profits. Additionally, the utility companies need to be motivated by goodwill to save customers money and increase the overall system efficiency.

Demand for power continues to grow, driven largely by the electricity needs of artificial intelligence data centers. While growing demand puts upward pressure on the price paid for electricity, Rute said, “there’s a lot of public pressure for utilities to not raise rates.” And making decisions that keep costs low will lead to greater “social capital” for utility companies.

Making his pitch to utilities, Rute added that Gridraven is “available at the cost of a weather forecast that you already have anyway.”",https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/gridraven_Getty_Images_clean.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 11:14:21.946093

The project aims to divert billions of gallons of wastewater annually from Hoosier rivers and streams, and fulfills plans to address nearly all combined sewer overflows in Central Indiana.

DigIndy was completed after a 14-year construction process and will bolster Indiana’s progress in reducing sewage overflow events into Indiana’s waterways. A combined sewage overflow (CSO) is a utility wastewater discharge that occurs when rainfall or snowmelt exceeds the system’s capacity, causing it to be overwhelmed and discharge untreated sewage into rivers and streams, potentially posing a threat to human health and the environment.

In 2008, more than 35 billion gallons of untreated sewage were released from CSO events across Indiana. By 2024, that figure dropped to 10.2 billion gallons, a 71.3% reduction. IDEM tracks CSO volumes through required monthly discharge monitoring reports from utilities, field inspections, and data analysis, one of the most robust assessment programs in the U.S. These tools allow IDEM to assess compliance, measure progress, and ensure that communities are meeting commitments to protect water quality.

The $2 billion DigIndy Tunnel system covers 28 miles, with tunnels around 20 stories below the city. The system’s job is to collect sewage and stormwater overflows during heavy rains, treat it and then release it. The massive project is one of the largest public works projects in Indianapolis history, with 8 tunnels running through all parts of the city, including Irvington, Fountain Square, and Garfield Park.

Citizens Energy Group said it will divert at least 95% of sewage and stormwater so it can protect rivers and prevent flooding. Planning for the project began in 2006, after the city entered into the consent decree with the EPA that work must be completed by 2025.",,N,,2025-10-16 08:00:10.476850

Orsted operates a large portfolio of offshore wind farms and is building six more.
Since then, Orsted has led the way in building wind farms in waters off Europe and elsewhere, including Taiwan.
Not all of the Danish wind industry is struggling.
The Trump administration has taken several steps to curb offshore wind, including halting construction on two wind farms off the East Coast of the United States.","For the Danish wind farm developer Orsted, the bad news has not stopped. Once on its way to becoming a giant of renewable energy, the company is now shrinking in everything from stock market value to ambition.

The reversal of fortune comes amid a broad downturn in the offshore wind industry set off by rising construction costs and interest rates after the pandemic and exacerbated by President Trump’s dislike of wind farms.

Orsted, which helped create and dominated the offshore wind industry, has felt a huge impact from these setbacks. The company said last week that it would lay off 2,000 people, or 25 percent of its staff, over the next two years.

Rasmus Errboe, the company’s president and chief executive, offered a blunt explanation for the job cuts: Orsted was narrowing its focus and dialing back its aspirations.

Instead of lining up new, multibillion-dollar wind farms to build in shallow waters around the globe, Orsted will mainly focus on finishing those it has under construction and managing them or selling them off.

The company will complete “our large construction portfolio in the coming years, which is why we’ll need fewer employees,” Mr. Errboe said in a statement.

Orsted operates a large portfolio of offshore wind farms and is building six more. These arrays of enormous turbines produce the bulk of the company’s revenue, close to $7 billion this year, according to analysts’ estimates.

The reshaping of Orsted is rippling across its home country, Denmark, which for half a century has been a nurturing ground of the contemporary wind industry.

A predecessor of Orsted built the world’s first offshore wind farm, Vindeby, in 1991 in Denmark. Since then, Orsted has led the way in building wind farms in waters off Europe and elsewhere, including Taiwan. Europe now has more than 3,600 offshore wind turbines, many of them developed by Orsted.

Not all of the Danish wind industry is struggling. Vestas Wind Systems, the leading maker of wind turbines, looks better positioned for the current environment because it is largely focused on land-based equipment rather than offshore machines and has factories in Colorado that should help buffer any impact from Mr. Trump’s tariffs.

Orsted said 235 of the 500 layoffs planned for this quarter would be in Denmark, where some 33,000 people work in the wind industry, according to Green Power Denmark, an industry group.

The wind industry employs roughly 370,000 people in Europe and accounts for around 20 percent of the region’s electricity generation, according to WindEurope, a trade body.

As much as any country, Denmark has embraced a vision of a future in which much of the global economy runs to a great extent on electricity generated from green sources.

Recent developments, though, including rising costs and the Trump administration’s efforts to stymie renewable energy, have prompted a reassessment of some of the goals that the European Union and national authorities have set for the industry.

Wood Mackenzie, an energy consulting firm, forecast that less than 50 percent of the cumulative targets set by national governments, excluding China, for offshore wind for the end of the decade will be achieved.

“I think, in terms of electrification, there are certainly warning signs,” said Anders Kronborg, senior economist at Copenhagen Economics, a research firm.

The Trump administration has taken several steps to curb offshore wind, including halting construction on two wind farms off the East Coast of the United States. It later allowed one, Empire Wind off New York, to move forward. A federal judge ruled that the other, Revolution Wind, a nearly completed Orsted project off Rhode Island, could continue.

Still, the intervention in projects where billions of dollars have already been spent has created uncertainty about investing in the United States.

“In the coming years, nobody will start any new projects in offshore wind in the U.S.,” said Anders Schelde, the chief financial officer of AkademikerPension, a Danish pension fund that invests in green energy. “I’m sure that it will probably also have some impact on other renewables,” he added.

Welcon, which fashions giant wind turbine sections called towers in the town of Give, in western Denmark, is supplying Orsted’s Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind projects but is not expecting any new business from across the Atlantic.

“I don’t believe in the U.S. before we have a new president,” said Carsten Pedersen, the company’s chairman.

Mr. Pedersen said that Welcon’s vast factory in the flatlands of the Jutland peninsula had orders through 2027 but that he worried about the stamina of weaker companies and the lost momentum toward cleaner energy.

“It’s so sad, I think, what’s happening now,” he said. “We had a chance to make the green transition.”

The Danish government, which owns a majority of Orsted’s shares, has had to come to the aid of the company and the wind industry it supports by putting around $4.7 billion into a recent offering to shareholders.

“In my view, this is a business that is going to be around,” said Charles Lemonides, founder of ValueWorks, a New York-based fund management company that increased its stake in Orsted to about $15 million. “The world’s not using less electricity,” he added.

Analysts, though, say that in the coming years, Orsted is likely to be diminished as an instrument for expanding wind power. The company has been forced to concentrate on survival.

“After these assets are built, they don’t really have any other live projects,” said Deepa Venkateswaran, a utility analyst at Bernstein, a Wall Street research firm.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/16/multimedia/16biz-renewable-europe-01-zgbt/16biz-renewable-europe-01-zgbt-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 04:58:28.599666

Preskill says action at the state level is key. “This report shows that clean energy is a bright spot in the Midwest economy,” Preskill said, “and the future of the Midwest’s clean energy economy depends on state leaders acting with urgency.” The group’s report says Iowa lawmakers should fast-track renewable energy deployment before the federal solar and wind tax credits expire and enact state tax incentives that help fill some of the void when the credits do go away.

The group says the rapid rise in data centers is contributing to unprecedented demand for electricity and states like Iowa should prioritize low-cost, clean options like solar and wind power to meet that demand.

Sign up for their newsletter here.

During a recent visit to a Long Island power station, U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright criticized Biden-era policies that supported the development of renewable energy sources.

“There was a lot of that money allocated under the Biden administration that was to encourage business and utilities to … spend money to make electricity more expensive and less reliable,” Wright said during a press conference.

The next day, the Trump administration announced the termination of 321 awards, claiming $7.5 billion in cuts for clean-energy projects. Inside Climate News recently reported that many of these awards were already past their end date.

Empire Clean Cities, which promotes the advancement of alternative fuels and alternative-fuel vehicles to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, was among the organizations that had its funds cut.

The Manhattan-based nonprofit will lose more than 90% of the funds for its $1.7 million award. So far, Empire Clean Cities had received only $162,631 of its award for a project designed to reduce emissions in Hunts Point in the Bronx, according to federal spending data. Largely due to truck traffic, this neighborhood has an annual child asthma hospitalization rate double the citywide average.

“It’s where folks live and work, and so they see every day the impact of truck traffic emissions on their air quality, on their health,” said Joy Gardner, the executive director of Empire Clean Cities. ​“This was a real opportunity to make a drastic change in just the general quality of life.”

Hunts Point attracts a high volume of freight traffic partly due to its proximity to food centers, including the Hunts Point Food Distribution Center. The city estimates that the center distributes around 4.5 billion pounds of food every year.

Empire Clean Cities is on the cusp of publishing an electrification plan for Hunts Point, with engagement from local businesses, communities, and city agencies. The plan would offer a pathway to electrification for vehicles operating in the neighborhood—and subsequently help alleviate the health issues many residents face.

Though Gardner said the plan is likely to still be published, other aspects of the plan could be delayed or may not happen at all. The nonprofit planned to install six fast-charging electric ports in the neighborhoods, for personal and freight vehicles, according to Gardner.

Empire Clean Cities also planned to provide technical assistance to businesses looking to electrify their truck fleets and information sessions for community members who might want to buy an electric vehicle. According to federal spending data, the nonprofit would ​“undertake an extensive suite of community outreach activities designed to break down the knowledge barriers preventing [electric vehicle] adoption in the neighborhood.”

“It’s really disappointing not to be able to take this over the finish line, especially with just a year left on the grant,” said Gardner. ​“We would have been able to do a tremendous amount with that.”

In a statement about the grant cancellations, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) said, ​“These cuts directly impact local businesses and major companies, putting workers out of jobs, shuttering factories, and slowing our state’s economic progress.”

In response to questions from Inside Climate News, Ken Lovett, Hochul’s senior communications advisor on energy and environment, wrote that the announcement ​“came as no surprise given the Trump administration’s full-on assault on clean energy.”

The Trump administration announced the termination of 321 grants on Oct. 2. An Inside Climate News analysis of federal government spending data for the awards found that only 188 were still active, according to their stated end dates, at the end of September.

ICN subtracted money already sent to recipients from the sums obligated to be spent, calculating a total of $4.87 billion in cuts, roughly two-thirds of the dollar amount announced by the Department of Energy.

For recipients based in New York state, 20 awards were still active when the Trump administration announced the cuts. After accounting for the money already distributed, the state lost out on about $146 million.

But for Hochul, the grant cuts seem to be just the latest setback to her plans to deliver on the state’s lofty climate goals and address energy concerns. She has recently admitted that New York is unlikely to meet its climate targets, drawing the ire of many residents.

Hochul says she remains committed to reducing emissions in the state and has invested considerable funds toward that goal. She recently allocated $1 billion to clean-energy projects and emissions-reduction efforts and has directed the state-owned utility, the New York Power Authority, to build at least one new nuclear plant by 2040.

Hochul’s predicament

At a Brooklyn church in early September, the advocacy group Public Power NY hosted a People’s Hearing for Public Renewables, where officials, environmentalists, and a few dozen New York residents discussed the state’s renewable-energy plans and expressed disappointment with Hochul’s progress.

“We have a movement behind us that is fighting for something better,” said state Sen. Jabari Brisport, a Democrat who represents a district in Brooklyn. ​“We have a governor who wants to drag her feet.”

New York’s Climate Act requires the state to achieve a 40% reduction from 1990 levels in economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and an 85% reduction by 2050. The act also requires that 70% of the state’s electricity come from renewable sources by 2030.

Residents were advocating for the New York Power Authority to build 15 gigawatts of renewable energy by 2030, which they view as necessary to meet the state’s goal of net-zero emissions from the electricity grid by 2040. Currently, the utility plans to build 7 gigawatts of renewable energy, despite state law requiring it to fill all gaps in electricity generation left by the private sector.

“Hurricane Ida completely destroyed my district,” said former Democratic U.S. Rep. Jamaal Bowman, whose district included White Plains and Yonkers. ​“We need a governor with human-centered leadership … and if not, we need a new governor.”

Much of the focus on achieving these climate goals has been on electrifying building heating and cooling with heat pumps and moving away from gas systems. In 2023, the state passed the All-Electric Building Act, which mandated that most buildings use electric appliances, and the all-electric standard was written into the state building code in July.

The legislation effectively requires most new buildings to be completely electric — so no gas heating or cooking. A similar law was passed in New York City in 2021.

At a recent press conference, Wright, the federal energy secretary, alluded to the ​“many productive dialogues” he has had with the governor, and said that two proposed gas pipelines, which would pass through the state and which state officials have rejected in the past, were ​“already planned” and would ​“lower the cost of heating.”

There has been speculation, fueled by a May post on X by Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, that Hochul ​“would move forward on critical pipeline capacity.” The implication was that this was a trade-off for allowing the Empire Wind offshore wind project south of Long Island in the Atlantic Ocean to proceed after the administration halted construction.

Within a month, two previously rejected gas pipelines — the Constitution pipeline and the Northeast Supply Enhancement pipeline, or NESE — entered the regulatory process once again. Hochul has denied that she made a deal with the White House, but the Trump administration has said that she ​“caved” and agreed to allow the pipeline construction, according to Politico’s E&E News.

The Constitution pipeline, which the state rejected in 2016, would run from Pennsylvania’s Marcellus shale fracking sites to upstate New York. The NESE pipeline would extend an existing pipeline, building off the coast of New Jersey and Staten Island to eventually connect with existing pipes in Queens, and add gas infrastructure to Pennsylvania. The state has rejected it three times.

In July, National Grid, the gas utility that serves Staten Island, Long Island, and parts of Brooklyn and Queens, added the NESE pipeline to its long-term gas plan as an addendum.

The utility has to file a long-term gas plan as a result of a dispute with former Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D). The heart of the 2019 dispute was, ironically, an earlier proposal for the NESE pipeline, which the Department of Environmental Conservation had rejected due to its potential impacts on water quality.

The rejection led to a standoff between the utility and state officials, with National Grid refusing to connect customers to gas lines. The dispute only ended because Cuomo threatened to suspend the utility’s license to operate in the state. In the end, National Grid agreed to periodically file a long-term gas plan for review by the state’s Public Service Commission, which regulates utility rates.

The NESE pipeline resurfaces

While reviewing the utility’s plan for the future last month, members of the Public Service Commission found that the NESE project would help the state meet the energy needs of its residents and businesses, particularly in the wake of Winter Storm Elliott in 2022. A report by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission found that some areas of New York were at extreme risk of experiencing gas shutoffs at one point during the storm.

But many New Yorkers were dismayed by the commission’s choice, which has no regulatory authority over the pipeline, but which many believe could signal to the Department of Environmental Conservation that the pipeline is necessary and that it should approve its water permit.

“We are in a week-by-week, hour-by-hour, fight to hold [Hochul] off and keep her from approving this thing,” Pete Sikora, the climate and inequality campaigns director with New York Communities for Change, said about the fight to stop the NESE pipeline.

Several public officials, including Staten Island Borough President Vito Fossella (R) and U.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D), spoke out against the pipeline, as did the city of New York. Water-quality concerns and fears of substantial rate increases abound.

“The governor is willing to put the law off to the side in order to appease fossil-fuel interests, big private business interests … and for New York families to foot the bill for that,” said Kim Fraczek, the executive director of Sane Energy, a nonprofit organization that is advocating for the replacement of gas infrastructure with renewable energy. ​“Our costs will only increase, and that’s for ratepayers and for businesses.”

A report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, an energy-research think tank, estimated that the pipeline would cost $1.25 billion — almost $200 million more than what National Grid had said — due to construction inflation. Even if National Grid’s figures are correct, ratepayers would suffer a substantial monthly increase.

Hochul is also experiencing pressure from the other side of the aisle. Energy Secretary Wright recently criticized the state’s Climate Act, which requires the state to have a net-zero-emissions electricity grid by 2040, calling it ​“totally nuts.”

“The longer and more aggressively [net-zero] is pursued, the more you elevate your energy prices and impoverish your citizens,” Wright told journalists at the press conference in Long Island earlier this month. ​“Let’s build more energy infrastructure to drive down the cost of energy here in New York state, across New England, and across our country.”

Whether the Climate Act drives the state’s high energy prices remains a subject of debate. A recent Public Service Commission report found that cost recovery for Climate Act measures accounted for anywhere from 5% to 9.5% of a residential customer’s monthly electric bill — but consistently 2% or less of their gas bill — in 2024.

Another factor contributing to higher rates has been large-scale improvements in gas infrastructure. Last year, residents in downstate New York experienced rate hikes when National Grid began a $5 billion system upgrade, which included replacing ​“leak-prone” pipes across the region.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-2203085341.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=a990d02fba6305386b51364ddd7350d3,N,,2025-10-16 04:58:40.271173

READ: AI Data Centers Are Sending Consumer Electric Bills Soaring

Utility bills across the country have already been on the rise as the proliferation of AI data centers fuels a demand surge that’s raising prices for all consumers. In some regions, the cost of rebuilding infrastructure after extreme weather events is also driving up expenses.

The biggest increase is expecting in the South Atlantic region spanning Delaware to Florida, followed by New England. The rise in power costs come as households using propane or heating oil see some relief: Spending on propane is projected to fall 9%, and heating-oil expenditures 8%, supported by ample inventories and lower crude prices.

The U.S electric vehicle market size was valued at USD 48.03 billion in 2024 and is anticipated to reach USD 60.26 billion in 2025 to USD 369.88 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 25.46% during the forecast period from 2025 to 2033.

The electric vehicle is a structural reconfiguration of mobility, infrastructure, and industrial identity. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, EVs accounted for 11.2% of all new light-duty vehicle sales in 2023, up from just 4.6% in 2020, yet only 38% of American households live within five miles of a DC fast charger, as mapped by the Department of Transportation’s National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program.

MARKET DRIVERS

Corporate Fleet Electrification as a Supply Chain Imperative

The acceleration of EV adoption is orchestrated by corporate logistics and procurement mandates that treat electrification as an operational necessity, which is augmented in propelling the growth of the U.S. electric vehicle market. In 2023 alone, these fleets ordered more than 150,000 electric vans and trucks, surpassing retail EV sales in several months, as documented by the Electrification Coalition’s Fleet Adoption Tracker. These fleets operate on fixed routes, predictable schedules, and centralized charging hubs, making them ideal candidates for electrification long before individual buyers overcome range anxiety.

State-Level Zero-Emission Vehicle Mandates Reshaping Dealer Networks

California, New York, and Washington now enforce Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandates requiring automakers to sell increasing percentages of EVs or face financial penalties, which is leveraging the growth of TheS. Electric vehicle market. Automakers are responding not by expanding retail offerings, while Ford redirecting F-150 Lightning production to prioritize regions where compliance incentives outweigh federal tax credit delays. These mandates bypass consumer hesitation entirely, forcing manufacturers to build EVs even when demand lags.

MARKET RESTRAINTS

Charging Infrastructure Disparities and Grid Strain in Rural and Low-Income Communities

The EV charging in affluent urban corridors, which is leaving rural and low-income communities behind, is restricting the growth of the U.S. electric vehicle market. Simultaneously, grid operators in areas like Arizona and Texas report transformer overloads caused by clusters of home EV charging during evening peaks, prompting utilities to impose “EV connection moratoriums” in neighborhoods without substation upgrades. The EV transition risks deepening mobility inequality, which is turning clean transportation into a privilege of zip code rather than policy.

Battery Raw Material Dependency and Supply Chain Fragility

The dependence on foreign-sourced minerals is undermining its claim to energy sovereignty, which is quietly inhibiting the growth of the U.S. electric vehicle market. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, 78% of lithium and 62% of cobalt used in U.S.-assembled EV batteries are imported from China, Australia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, while less than 1% of lithium refining occurs domestically. Even recycling infrastructure lags, as only 5% of end-of-life EV batteries are currently processed domestically, per the ReCell Center’s 2023 Recovery Report.

MARKET OPPORTUNITIES

Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) Integration as a Distributed Energy Resource

The electric vehicles are evolving from passive consumers into active grid assets through bidirectional charging systems that allow EVs to discharge stored energy back into homes or the grid during peak demand. The growing demand is ascribed to boosting the growth of the U.S. electric vehicle market to some extent. According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, pilot programs in California and Vermont demonstrated that a single V2G-enabled EV can provide up to 8 kWh of backup power, enough to sustain a household for six hours during an outage. Meanwhile, Ford’s F-150 Lightning, now sold with Home Power Backup capability, has been integrated into utility demand-response programs in Texas, where owners earn $150/month for allowing their vehicles to feed power back during emergencies.

Industrial-Grade Charging Hubs as Economic Anchors in Declining Regions

The deployment of high-capacity EV charging stations along major freight corridors is becoming a catalyst for regional revitalization in economically distressed communities. Similarly, in Detroit, the city partnered with Electrify America to install 120 charging ports across abandoned auto plants, transforming shuttered industrial sites into mobility innovation zones with training centers for EV technicians. These hubs serve not just passenger vehicles, but delivery fleets, transit buses, and heavy-duty trucks sectors that are rapidly electrifying under federal mandates.

MARKET CHALLENGES

Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities in the Connected EV Ecosystem

GA's growing number of cyber threats, with the penetration of internet connectivity with EEVs, is merely a challenging factor for the growth of the U.S. electric vehicle market. According to the SAE International Cybersecurity Benchmark Report, 89% of EV models tested in 2023 had exploitable vulnerabilities in telematics systems, including unencrypted communication channels, default passwords in firmware, and remote access flaws that could allow hackers to disable brakes, lock doors, or drain batteries remotely. The threat is not theoretical, but a coordinated cyberattack targeting EV charging networks could trigger cascading grid failures, especially during peak demand events. The future of mobility is being wired without armor.

Consumer Perception Gap Between Cost of Ownership and Upfront Price

The persistent consumer resistance from the psychological dissonance between upfront price and long-term savings is expected to slow the growth of the U.S. electric vehicle market. Meanwhile, insurance premiums for EVs remain 18–22% higher than ICE vehicles due to repair complexity and parts scarcity, further eroding perceived value. The car may be cheaper to run, but the story hasn’t been told right.

REPORT COVERAGE

SEGMENT ANALYSIS

By Vehicle Insights

The passenger electric cars segment was the largest and held a dominant share of the U.S. EV market in 2024, with the environmental idealism, but in cultural familiarity and infrastructure accessibility, passenger EVs leverage existing residential charging networks and benefit from decades of automotive branding that equates ownership with personal identity. Tesla’s Model Y became the best-selling vehicle in America across all fuel types in Q4 2023, per Cox Automotive data, while Ford Mustang Mach-E and Chevrolet Bolt EV gained traction among middle-income households seeking tech-forward alternatives to gasoline sedans.

The commercial electric vehicles segment is likely to grow with a significant CAGR of 58.7% from 2025 to 2033. The U.S. Postal Service ordered 10,000 Oshkosh-built electric delivery vans in 2023 alone, which is a program that will replace 16% of its entire fleet by 2026, according to USPS Office of Inspector General reports. Walmart, FedEx, and UPS have collectively committed to over 200,000 EVs by 2030, creating predictable, large-scale demand that automakers prioritize over consumer models. These fleets operate on fixed routes, centralized depots, and predictable usage cycles by making them ideal candidates for electrification long before individual consumers overcome range anxiety. California was the top performer of the U.S. EV market by capturing 39.3% of share in 2024, with the nation’s most populous state and regulatory laboratory, making it the de facto proving ground for electrification policy.

COUNTRY ANALYSIS

Texas Market Analysis

Texas's electric vehicle market was positioned second by accounting for 11.4% of share in 2024. The state’s lack of income tax and expansive road networks make long-haul freight electrification economically viable, which is prompting companies like Lone Star Logistics to retrofit 500 electric semi-trucks for regional hauls, as noted by the Texas Clean Energy Coalition.

India’s Robust Push Toward Electric Mobility India EV market is growing at unprecedented speed.","China has officially filed a complaint against India at the World Trade Organisation (WTO), alleging that New Delhi’s electric vehicle (EV) and battery manufacturing subsidies give domestic companies an unfair advantage over global competitors. The dispute marks a new flashpoint in the fast-growing global EV industry. The use of WTO mechanisms by China, ironically seen as one of the biggest backers of subsidies for domestic industry will not be missed by anyone.

China’s Complaint and Its Concerns

According to reports, China’s Ministry of Commerce has warned that it will take “firm measures” to protect the rights of Chinese EV manufacturers. Beijing claims that India’s extensive incentive programmes - ranging from EV production subsidies to concessional tax benefits - distort the playing field for Chinese automakers considering entry into the Indian market.

The complaint comes at a time when India is planning to create a National Critical Mineral Stockpile (NCMS). The NCMS aims to secure long-term access to essential rare earth elements used in EV batteries, solar panels, and wind turbines. This initiative follows China’s recent restrictions on exporting key minerals, a move that has intensified global efforts to diversify supply chains away from Beijing.

Under WTO rules, India now has 30 days to enter consultations with China to resolve the issue. If both nations fail to reach an agreement, China can request the formation of a dispute settlement panel to adjudicate the case.

EV Overcapacity and China’s Expanding Push Abroad

China’s EV industry has developed rapidly over the past decade with strong state support, including subsidies, tax rebates, and consumer incentives. In a now familiar templete, domestic capacities have been bult to serve the global market, leading to serious overcapacity issues as countries have sought to block cheaper Chinese entrants. On top of that , as China's domestic market slows and production capacity outpaces demand, many Chinese automakers, such as BYD, face a massive challange without access to newer, significant markets. Interestingly, the recent report by AlixPartners noted that only 15 out of the 129 electric vehicle (EV) and plug-in hybrid brands currently operating in China are expected to remain financially viable by 2030.

India, with its vast consumer base and growing clean mobility ecosystem, presents an attractive opportunity. However, India’s increasing protection for domestic manufacturing and preference for local value addition have raised concerns for foreign firms attempting to compete on equal terms.

India’s Robust Push Toward Electric Mobility

India EV market is growing at unprecedented speed. In FY 2024–25, electric two‑wheeler sales reached 11.49 lakh units, up 21 percent from the previous year. This expansion is being built on the back of several government schemes designed to make India a hub for clean transportation and advanced battery manufacturing.

Government Incentives Driving Growth

FAME Phase-I & National Electric Mobility Mission Plan (NEMMP) 2020:

FAME India Scheme (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles) was implemented from 2015 to 2019 to encourage the adoption of electric and hybrid vehicles. Under the first phase of FAME (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles), more than 2.55 lakh EVs were supported, along with the development of essential charging infrastructure.

National Electric Mobility Mission Plan (NEMMP) 2020 was launched to accelerate EV production and adoption.

FAME India Phase‑II:

Furthermore, the group notes that hundreds of energy storage projects are currently stalled in PJM’s interconnection queue, with regulatory, permitting, and market design barriers delaying critical deployment.

Energy storage is positioned as a bridging technology that complements most renewable generation by delivering dispatchable power during peak demand, smoothing variability, and helping avoid costly infrastructure overbuild. The report urges state and PJM policymakers to streamline interconnection processes, reform market rules to properly value storage services, clarify transmission charge allocations, and modernize permitting standards.

For Maryland counties, the expansion of energy storage carries direct and growing implications. Storage projects can help stabilize local grids and reduce strain on distribution infrastructure. Still, these systems come with new public safety risks, and should they fail, they can create a serious local or regional crisis.

Here's What We Got Instead - InsideEVs,Kevin Williams,,,,,https://insideevs.com/news/775910/nacs-story-experience-kia-leaf/,"This is kind of the whole reason why we’ve got a switch en masse to Tesla’s power plug, known as the North American Charging Standard (NACS).

“If you look at Level 1, Level 2 charging, the most common ports are the J1772.
Sure, thousands of drivers now have access to Tesla Supercharging, but I’d wager that most real EV drivers won’t really ever use them.","For years, it was assumed by many in the car industry that concerns about the charging network were the sole reason why Tesla was seeing such runaway success. After all, Tesla had successfully convinced its customers that its cars and charging network came with almost no compromises—that they could be used just like gas vehicles. And if other EVs couldn’t offer the same experience, they were essentially destined to fail.

This is kind of the whole reason why we’ve got a switch en masse to Tesla’s power plug, known as the North American Charging Standard (NACS). A few deals and handshakes a couple of years ago, and now virtually every EV brand has made the switch to the plug, with the goal of gaining access to Tesla’s Supercharger network.

Charging could then be seamless, everywhere, powered by a slimmer plug instead of a bulky CCS unit, and actually work on the first attempt. Finally, I wouldn’t have to hear anyone say they’d never buy an EV until they could use the “Tesla Plug”. Here you go, damn you, every collective automaker told consumers who were on the fence about buying an EV. We even gave it a big award here at InsideEVs last year.

And yet, as the initial crop of NACS-equipped cars makes their way to roads, and we get our hands on them for more than just an afternoon drive, I don’t know if the change was as dramatic as everyone insisted it’d be. This month, I’ve driven three cars with native NACS plugs: the Lucid Gravity, the 2026 Nissan Leaf and the updated Kia EV6. And I am not convinced that NACS is the lifesaver we thought it would be.

In fact, it made things a bit harder.

My first run-in with native NACS outside of Tesla came via the new Kia EV6 facelift. It’s not just a new plug, either. Kia went out of its way to make sure it’s Tesla Supercharger-ready, moving the rear-mounted port from the passenger side to the driver’s side, like on a Model Y or a Model 3.

I had the EV6 press tester delivered from Detroit to Ohio, where I live. And as I usually do, I asked the fleet drivers not to recharge it during the trip so I could do my own 10% to 80% charging test later.

Kia EV6

Yet, about 45 minutes before the EV6 was to show up at my door, I got a call.

The driver of the EV6 got nervous. About 30 miles away from my house, he called asking if I knew of a place where he could charge. He was at about 21%, enough to make it to my front door, but I can understand why the lack of range would cause trepidation for a fleet driver driving freeway speeds.

After a short conversation, I ascertained that either Kia or the fleet company itself had only given him a NACS to J1772 charging adapter. That would allow him to plug the EV6 into any slower, Level 2 charger, but he’d need a different adapter to use a non-Tesla DC fast-charger—and he didn’t have one.

There was a Tesla supercharging station somewhat on his journey, but he had no Tesla app account and would have needed to pay with a special corporate card that wasn’t set up for Tesla Supercharging.

I told him to take it slow and continue to drive. With luck, he got the EV6 to me at 8%; not bad, but I can only imagine how nerve-racking that was.

This may sound like a narrow and very specific use case, the kind of thing that won’t happen to most EV drivers. In reality, it’s more of the same: be prepared. Know where your stations are. Make sure you have the right equipment, which in this case is various adapters. Is that really any easier than before? Plus, there’s the fact that not all Tesla Supercharger stations are open to all non-Tesla EVs; you won’t know this until you fire up the app, but many stations remain exclusive to the home team.

While in my possession, the EV6 was locked out of all my traditional DC fast charging test spots, forcing me to either go significantly out of my way to a new Ionna charging station or use a Tesla Supercharger. Also, the EV6’s famously high charging speeds are limited when using the Supercharger; tack on an extra 10 to 15 minutes of charging time if you do.

Most drivers do (and should) use Level 2 charging, either at home or in public, and reconfiguring a car’s charging port to cater to what is kind of a niche experience for most EV owners seems weird. I shudder to picture the confusion of a NACS-native car that pulls up to a J1772 Level 2 charging station from ChargePoint or something, only to realize they can’t plug in.

It sounds silly, but stuff like this adds friction and points of pain and confusion for drivers. We’re already having issues getting people to buy these things in the first place, so this just seems like it would make it worse.

It appears that on some level, Nissan agrees with me, too. The latest 2026 Nissan Leaf famously has two ports: a Tesla NACS-port for DC fast charging on one side, but also a J1772 port for Level 2 charging on the other side. It’s weird, and clearly a stopgap meant to satiate the new NACS-native push that came as a prerequisite for access to the Tesla Supercharging network.

But Nissan kept the standard port on purpose. “If you look at Level 1, Level 2 charging, the most common ports are the J1772. So instead of delaying the vehicle to be able to have AC and DC commonized into one port, we decided that in this transition period that it would be best for the customer to just have both,” said Jeff Tessmer, a senior R&D engineer at Nissan.

And he’s right. I miss my Mitsubishi i-MiEV, but my example famously did not have any DC fast charging. (Believe it or not, that was an optional add-on, once.) Before my car went to the great big graveyard in the sky, it did 75% of my daily driving. I had a routine of known charging stations that I’d frequent; Level 2 was always enough for my driving needs, since the car would be sitting for hours. I’d wager that smartly-placed Level 2 charging stations would be all anyone ever needs, save for the one-off road trip where DC fast charging would come into play.

Now, this isn’t just me deriding NACS. I think the plug shape itself has a significantly more ergonomic design compared to the bulky and unwieldy CCS. Most NACS plugs I’ve used are dead simple and easy to plug in.

And this also, unfortunately, highlights the advantage Tesla still has with charging. It’s one plug that does it all, from Destination to Superchargers. I suspect the vast majority of Tesla owners only really ever mess with J1772 adapters sometimes. Why bother with CCS when you have Superchargers everywhere? For the rest of us, we’ll still be stuck in App and Adapter Hell a bit longer.

I just am not convinced this will be the industry-saving innovation that brands and EV enthusiasts really think it will be. Sure, thousands of drivers now have access to Tesla Supercharging, but I’d wager that most real EV drivers won’t really ever use them. Because you kind of don’t need it.
