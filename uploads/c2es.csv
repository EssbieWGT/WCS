With all the challenges facing private companies this year, they must leverage every available tax benefit.

Fortunately, lawmakers have packed the federal tax code with credits and incentives to reward taxpayers for specific activities and investments.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act made significant revisions to energy credits, imposing new restrictions and phasing out many of the credits early.

Despite the changes, there is still considerable runway for many projects, and both the tax equity financing and credit transfer markets should remain robust over the next several years.

In addition, the OBBBA enhanced existing incentives, offering new opportunities for tax-efficient structuring.

Energy Provisions

The OBBBA has reshaped the energy credit landscape. Several credits were extended or enhanced, while many others are subject to new sourcing and investment requirements or are phasing out early.

The legislation does not affect the ability to transfer or claim refundable payments for specified credits.

Consumer Credits: The OBBBA repeals several energy-related tax credits directed to consumers, each with distinct effective dates:

Section 25E—Previously Owned Clean Vehicle Credit: Repealed for vehicles acquired after Sept. 30, 2025.

Section 30D—Clean Vehicle Credit: Repealed for vehicles acquired after Sept. 30, 2025.

Section 45W—Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit: Repealed for vehicles acquired after Sept. 30, 2025.

Section 30C—Alternative Fuel Refueling Property Credit: Repealed for property placed in service after June 30, 2026.

Section 25C—Energy-Efficient Home Improvement Credit: Repealed for property placed in service after Dec. 31, 2025.

Section 25D—Residential Clean Energy Credit: Repealed for expenditures made after Dec. 31, 2025.

Section 45L—New Energy-Efficient Home Credit: Repealed for property acquired after June 30, 2026.

Depreciation: The bill eliminates the five-year depreciable life for qualified energy property, and the Section 179D deduction is repealed for construction beginning after June 30, 2026.

Investment, Production Tax Credits

The OBBBA accelerates the phaseout of the investment tax credit under Section 48E and the production tax credit under Section 45Y.

Projects that begin construction after 2033 will generally no longer qualify for these credits, with solar and wind facilities facing even earlier deadlines. To remain eligible, solar and wind projects that begin construction after July 4, 2026, must be placed in service by the end of 2027.

The legislation also introduces new restrictions related to prohibited foreign entities. Facilities beginning construction after Dec. 31, 2025, may not receive material assistance from such entities.

Material assistance is determined based on a cost ratio tied to the sourcing of eligible components. In addition, Section 48E now includes stricter domestic sourcing requirements to obtain the 10% bonus credit, reflecting a broader policy shift toward supply chain security and energy independence.

Importantly, the IRS has tightened the rules for establishing that construction has begun for purposes of the July 4, 2026, deadline for solar and wind facilities.

Under Notice 2025-43, the 5% safe harbor method is available only if taxpayers can use it to establish that construction began by Sept. 1, 2025.

Starting Sept. 2, the physical work test is the sole method for establishing the beginning of construction for wind and solar projects for purposes of the July 4, 2026, deadline.

This change applies to the credit phaseouts under the OBBBA, but not to the foreign entity of concern rules.

For FEOC exemption purposes, facilities may still use the 5% safe harbor to establish that construction began by Dec. 31, 2025.

Additionally, low-output solar facilities (≤1.5 MW AC) may continue to use the 5% safe harbor beyond that date. The four-year continuity safe harbor remains in place for projects that meet BOC requirements.

Historically, taxpayers could rely on either the physical work test or the 5% safe harbor. Notice 2025-42 now limits this to the physical work test, which requires significant physical work related to the energy property, either on-site or off-site, under a binding contract. Preliminary activities, such as design or site clearing, do not qualify.

To maintain credit eligibility, taxpayers must also meet the continuity requirement, which is satisfied if the facility is placed in service within four years of the BOC year.

Advanced Manufacturing Credit

The advanced manufacturing credit under Section 45X has been modified significantly.

While the credit is repealed for wind energy components sold after 2027, it remains available for other eligible components before a phasedown begins in 2031.

Components sold in 2031 will qualify for a 75% credit, decreasing to 50% in 2032 and 25% in 2033.

The credit is fully repealed for sales occurring in 2034 or later. Notably, the scope of the credit has been expanded to include metallurgical coal.

As with other energy provisions, the material assistance restrictions for prohibited foreign entities apply to all qualifying components.

Clean Fuel Production Credit

Under the OBBBA, the clean fuel production credit under Section 45Z has been extended through 2031.

The bill also reinstates the small agri-biodiesel credit under Section 40A, which can now be stacked with the 45Z credit.

A new geographic restriction has been added, disallowing the credit unless the feedstock is produced or grown in Canada, Mexico, or the U.S.

Additionally, the methodology for calculating greenhouse gas emissions has been revised to exclude indirect land use changes.

Prohibited foreign entity rules have also been extended to apply to clean fuel production facilities.

Planning considerations: Facilities must establish BOC by Dec. 31, 2025, to avoid FEOC restrictions beginning in 2026, and can continue to rely on the 5% safe harbor specifically to meet this deadline through the end of 2025.

Solar and wind projects beginning construction more than 12 months after the OBBBA enactment must be placed in service by the end of 2027 to qualify for Section 48E or 45Y credits.

Facilities that establish BOC by the deadline can rely on the four-year continuity safe harbor to place in service and preserve credit eligibility.

Other Energy Provisions

The clean hydrogen production credit under Section 45V is repealed for construction beginning after 2027—two years later than previously proposed.

Section 45Q credit rates for carbon capture used as a tertiary injectant or for productive use are increased to match those for permanent geologic storage, subject to new foreign-entity restrictions.

Publicly traded partnership rules now include income from carbon capture; nuclear, hydropower, and geothermal energy projects, as well as the transport or storage of sustainable aviation fuel or hydrogen.

The nuclear production credit under Section 45U is also subject to foreign entity restrictions.

Planning considerations: Taxpayers should assess project timelines and sourcing strategies in light of phaseouts and new restrictions. For Sections 45Y and 48E, construction must begin within eligibility windows—especially for solar and wind projects facing a 2027 placed-in-service deadline.

Supply chain planning is critical to avoid disqualification under foreign entity rules. Manufacturers of wind property eligible for Section 45X should consider accelerating production before the phaseout in 2027.

Clean fuel producers must ensure feedstock sourcing complies with geographic limits and updated emissions rules.

Entities pursuing carbon capture, hydrogen, or nuclear projects should factor in expanded PTP eligibility and foreign entity restrictions when structuring financing and partnerships.

Early action can help preserve credit eligibility and provide long-term benefits.

State Tax Credit Transfers

Following the enactment of the OBBBA, many states have expanded or introduced transferable tax credit programs, particularly in clean energy, affordable housing, and infrastructure.

These programs allow taxpayers to sell unused credits to third parties, creating liquidity and broader access to state-level incentives.

Transfer mechanisms vary by state, with some requiring pre-approval, certification, or registration, while others impose annual caps or limits on transfer volume.

The trend mirrors federal credit transferability under Section 6418 and reflects growing interest in flexible credit monetization strategies.

States are also beginning to adopt market infrastructure—such as broker platforms and insurance products—to support credit transfers and mitigate buyer risk.

As more jurisdictions adopt these frameworks, taxpayers with multistate operations should monitor developments closely to identify new opportunities.

Planning considerations: Taxpayers should assess eligibility and timing for generating transferable credits, especially in states with strict certification or sourcing requirements.

Early coordination with legal and tax advisors is essential to confirm compliance with documentation and reporting rules. Buyers should conduct due diligence on project qualification, transfer terms, and potential recapture risks.

Engaging with credit brokers or marketplaces may help improve pricing and identify reliable counterparties.

Additionally, taxpayers should consider how state credit transfers interact with federal incentives, particularly in structuring financing and partnership arrangements.

Strategic planning now can help enhance credit value and avoid missed opportunities as state programs continue to evolve.

New Markets Tax Credit Program Permanent

The New Markets Tax Credit program supports capital investments in low-income communities by offering tax credit-subsidized loans to eligible businesses for use toward eligible costs (e.g., real estate and furniture, fixtures, and equipment).

These loans often feature interest-only terms, below-market rates, and principal forgiveness after seven years, providing businesses with a permanent cash benefit.

Previously set to expire at the end of 2025, the NMTC program was made permanent by the OBBBA, with a continued annual allocation authority of $5 billion.

Eligible businesses—both for-profit and nonprofit—can apply for NMTC financing for capital expenditure projects in qualifying census tracts.

The program supports a wide range of sectors, including manufacturing, healthcare, education, renewable energy, and retail, though it excludes farming and residential rental activities.

Each year, certified Community Development Entities apply to the CDFI Fund for NMTC allocations.

If awarded an allocation, CDEs raise equity from tax credit investors and deploy capital to eligible businesses (otherwise known as Qualified Active Low-Income Community Businesses) based on community impact and strategic priorities, which may vary by geography or industry.

Planning considerations: The NMTC program remains highly competitive. Early engagement with CDEs and timely application are critical to securing financing.

Businesses should prepare detailed project plans that demonstrate substantial community impact and align with CDE priorities.

Acting early improves the likelihood of receiving funding and may unlock additional benefits.

Work Opportunity Tax Credit Set to Expire

The OBBBA did not extend the work opportunity tax credit, which is now set to expire for any individuals who begin work after Dec. 31, 2025.

The WOTC provides a valuable incentive for employers who often hire workers from specific targeted populations, including veterans, people with disabilities, people on food assistance, certain youth employees, and ex-felons.

Employers who frequently screen for qualified individuals as part of their hiring process should monitor the legislative process for a potential extension of the credit.

Pass-Through Deduction

The OBBBA makes permanent the 20% deduction for qualified business income under Section 199A and favorably adjusts the phaseout of the deduction for taxpayers who do not meet the wage expense and capital investment requirements or who participate in a “specified service trade or business.”

Planning considerations: The permanence of this provision provides welcome certainty for private companies engaged in qualifying activities.

The deduction is not available for a range of specified service businesses. There may be opportunities to segregate activities and to increase or allow deductions.

The safe harbor for rental activity to qualify as a Section 199A trade or business under Rev. Proc. 2019-38 remains in effect.

R&D Credit Opportunities

The research credit remains one of the most powerful incentives in the tax code, and the IRS continues to receive a high volume of claims, straining examination resources.

To improve administration and reduce improper claims, the IRS recently made several changes to Form 6765, clarifying documentation requirements for claiming the credit.

The revised Form 6765 was partially finalized for tax year 2025, with the IRS making the mandatory reporting of qualified research expenses by business component optional in Section G.

When Section G becomes mandatory for the 2026 tax year, taxpayers will be required to disclose the top 80% of QREs, with controlled group members required to attach detailed entity-level breakdowns.

Section E is currently mandatory and includes new questions related to officer wages, acquisitions, and use of the ASC 730 directive.

These updates reflect the IRS’s ongoing efforts to enhance transparency and strengthen audit readiness.

In response to ongoing compliance concerns, the IRS has increased scrutiny of research credit filings, including more frequent audits.

However, due to temporary resource constraints, some IRS Exam functions are operating at reduced capacity, which may delay enforcement actions.

Taxpayers should confirm that they are properly documenting claims and exploring state credit opportunities.

State Credit Changes

Over the past year, several states have enacted or revised legislation related to research and development tax credits. These changes reflect a growing trend to incentivize innovation and attract high-tech investment.

These states include:

Arizona: Arizona now permits the use of the alternative simplified credit (ASC) method for computing its credit for increased research activities. This provides greater flexibility and may lead to greater benefits. Refundable credits are available for small businesses with fewer than 150 employees, subject to pre-approval from the Arizona Commerce Authority.

Arkansas: Arkansas expanded its credit options, offering up to 33% for strategic research areas and university partnerships. Credits are nonrefundable but can offset 100% of state tax liability and be carried forward for up to nine years.

Connecticut: Connecticut expanded its R&D and R&E credits under H.B. 7287. Single-member LLCs may now qualify if they meet specific criteria. Refundability increased to 90% for small biotech firms and 65% for other small businesses, capped at $1.5 million per company annually.

Iowa: Iowa enacted Senate File 657, replacing its research activities credit with a targeted R&D tax credit program effective Jan. 1, 2026. Eligibility is limited to sectors such as advanced manufacturing, bioscience, finance, insurance, and technology. Credits are capped at $40 million annually and require CPA-verified QREs and a competitive application process through the Iowa Economic Development Authority.

Massachusetts: Massachusetts increased the maximum allowable credit for certain industries and introduced new documentation requirements for software development and AI-related R&D.

Michigan: Effective Jan. 1, 2025, Michigan reintroduced its R&D tax credit. Large businesses may claim 3% of qualifying expenses up to a base amount and 10% above it, capped at $2 million. Small businesses may claim 15% above the base amount, capped at $250,000. An additional 5% credit is available for university collaborations, capped at $200,000. The credit is refundable and subject to an annual cap of $100 million.

Minnesota: Minnesota introduced partial refundability for its R&D credit: 19.2% for 2025, increasing to 25% for 2026–2027.

Oklahoma: Oklahoma revised its R&D credit to align more closely with federal QRE definitions and introduced a new pre-approval application process.

Texas: Texas enhanced its franchise tax R&D credit via SB 2206 and repealed the R&D equipment sales tax exemption effective Jan. 1, 2026.

Planning considerations: Navigating the R&D credit has become more complex amid heightened review, evolving case law, and new compliance measures.

Taxpayers should make sure claims are well-supported and consistent with updated guidance to reduce audit risk and avoid delays.

Taxpayers should carefully assess eligibility for both federal and state research credits, maintain contemporaneous documentation, and prepare to defend claims under examination.

Strategic planning is essential to leveraging available incentives, especially given the complexity and variability of state-level programs.

Using a trusted tax advisor can help taxpayers maintain compliance with IRS and state regulations and effectively substantiate research credit claims.

Rules Changed for Qualified Small Business Stock

The OBBBA significantly enhances a tax-efficient structuring option for private companies. Qualified small business stock under Section 1202 offers tax-free appreciation and has been increasingly used by private equity in recent years.

Enacted in 1993, Section 1202 generally allows a non-corporate taxpayer to exclude a percentage of the gain from the sale or exchange of QSBS held for more than five years.

The eligible gain exclusion percentage is based on the date the stock is issued.

For stock issued before July 5, 2025, the maximum amount of gain on QSBS that can be excluded for any tax year by each taxpayer with respect to each issuing C corporation is generally limited to the greater of: (i) $10 million, minus the amount of gain excluded by that taxpayer in prior years with respect to the same issuing corporation; or (ii) 10 times the taxpayer’s aggregate adjusted basis in the QSBS sold during the tax year.

For stock issued after July 4, 2025, the OBBBA increases the $10 million limit to $15 million and adjusts this limit for inflation beginning in 2027. In addition, the OBBBA creates new 50% and 75% gain exclusion categories for QSBS held for at least three and four years, respectively.

The various QSBS exclusion percentages, exclusion limits, and required holding periods by stock issuance date are set out in the table below.

The OBBBA also increases the limit on aggregate gross assets to satisfy the qualified small business test for purposes of Section 1202. These thresholds are now as follows:

At all times through the date of issuance, the corporation’s aggregate gross assets must not have exceeded $50 million for issuances before July 5, 2025, or $75 million for issuances after July 4, 2025; and

Immediately after the date of issuance (and after considering amounts the corporation received in the issuance), the aggregate gross assets of the corporation must not exceed $50 million or $75 million for issuances before July 5, 2025, or after July 4, 2025, respectively. Aggregate gross assets are defined as cash plus the aggregate adjusted tax basis of the corporation’s other assets.

Planning considerations: After an issuance is deemed to be QSBS under Section 1202, the corporation’s gross assets can exceed the applicable threshold (either $50 million or $75 million) at a later date without prohibiting the previously issued stock from receiving Section 1202 treatment.

By increasing the threshold, the OBBBA renews an existing corporation’s ability to issue QSBS if their aggregate gross assets have exceeded $50 million in the past but have never exceeded $75 million.

This higher threshold also expands the potential QSBS benefits for private equity firms when acquiring target businesses with enterprise values of up to $75 million.

Opportunity Zone Extension

The OBBBA made the qualified opportunity zone program permanent, preserving one of the most generous tax incentives ever offered by Congress.

The provision can offer benefits to investors looking for tax-efficient returns, individual private companies investing in specific geographies, or asset managers setting up funds.

The OBBBA not only makes the program permanent, but it also changes the rules in essential ways. Funds and investors should consider the implications for their planning strategies.

The changes could affect the timing of gain transactions and capital contributions, the location of investments, and the compliance burdens for funds.

The current QOZ designations will expire at the end of 2026. New zones will be designated in rolling 10-year designation periods under new criteria that are expected to shrink the number of qualifying zones.

Under the current program, taxpayers can defer capital gains by investing in a qualified opportunity fund.

For investments made after 2026, taxpayers will be required to recognize the deferred gain five years after investing, but will receive a 10% increase in basis for holding the investment for five years. For QOFs operating in a new category of rural opportunity zones, this basis increase is 30%.

Taxpayers who make investments before the end of 2026 must still recognize the deferred gain at the end of 2026.

The more powerful tax benefit may be the tax-free appreciation on the underlying investment itself. Taxpayers will still receive a full basis step-up to fair market value for property held 10 years, but the OBBBA added a rule freezing the basis step-up to the FMV at 30 years after the date of the investment.

The operational rules for QOFs and qualified opportunity zone businesses are generally unchanged, except for property held in a rural opportunity zone.

The threshold for establishing the substantial improvement of qualifying property in a rural opportunity zone will be 50% of the basis rather than 100%, effective for any determinations after July 4, 2025.

QOFs and QOZBs will both be subject to increased reporting requirements.

Companies looking for new tax-efficient investing opportunities and gain deferral strategies should reassess their investment options, paying particular attention to which geographies are likely to qualify in 2027.

Planning considerations: The timing of capital gains transactions will be important. Delaying a capital gain transaction could allow taxpayers to make a deferral election in 2027 and defer recognizing the gain until well after the current 2026 recognition date.

Conversely, taxpayers planning investments in geographic areas that are unlikely to be redesignated may need to make the investments before the end of 2026.

Existing QOFs and QOZBs should consider their long-term capital needs because it is not clear whether any “grandfathering” relief will allow additional qualified investments in funds operating in QOZs that are not redesignated.

The new reporting rules will apply to both new and existing QOZs and QOZBs for tax years beginning after the date of enactment, and those entities will need to collect and report substantial new information that has never before been required.

REIT Structuring, Real Estate Benefits

The real estate investment tax structure remains an effective way to structure certain real estate activities with only one layer of tax.

The OBBBA raises from 20% to 25% the portion of the gross asset value of a REIT that may be attributable to equity and debt securities of taxable REIT subsidiaries, effective for tax years beginning after 2025. The change should provide added flexibility.

In addition, the OBBBA allows the completed contract method of accounting for many residential condominium, construction, and sale projects, effective for contracts entered into after July 4, 2025.

For residential developers that meet the average annual gross receipts test under Section 448 ($31 million in 2025), the maximum estimated contract length is increased from two to three years to qualify for the exception from the UNICAP rules under Section 263A.

Planning considerations: This provision provides much-needed tax relief to condo developers who had to report income under the percentage-of-completion method, which often required reporting income before receiving payment.

Allowing the use of the completed contract method of accounting allows better matching of reporting taxable income with the receipt of cash by the developer.

Unfortunately, the relief is provided only prospectively for contracts entered into after the July 4, 2025, enactment date.

Therefore, taxpayers with contracts entered into before the enactment date will continue to be subject to the old rules.

Moreover, reporting income for projects begun in prior years may be bound to the prior method of accounting.",https://www.cbia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Tax-Analysis_092518.png,N,,2025-12-29 11:58:57.160395

The company is studying the ways that its EVs can support the electric grid better, especially during emergencies.

While Toyota does not yet offer EVs with bidirectional charging, it says the technology has immense potential to ""transform the broader energy ecosystem.""

Blame AI data centers, or an outdated power grid, or extreme temperatures, or all of the above. However, one thing is clear as we head into 2026: the United States is on track for unprecedented electricity demand.

That might sound like an argument against electric vehicles. After all, why unleash an entire fleet of cars on this country that could further drain our already shaky electric grid? But that's only because most people don't know about bidirectional charging: an EV's ability to charge other devices using its battery, or power entire homes, or even put energy back into the grid.

Stay informed with our newsletter every weekday

For more info, read our Privacy Policy & Terms of Use.

Several EVs already offer this capability, and it's increasingly becoming a standard feature for these cars. Meanwhile, many automakers are working with electric utilities on vehicle-to-grid (V2G) pilot programs that could more directly support local power networks using energy from EV batteries.

The latest one to step up is Toyota. The automaker recently announced that it's entering a new phase of a longstanding V2G pilot program at its North American headquarters in Plano, Texas. Working with Oncor, a huge energy utility in the Lone Star State, and using Fermata Energy's bidirectional EV charger, a Japanese-spec bZ4X test vehicle is currently putting energy back into the grid. The charger ""enables bidirectional energy flow by analyzing price signals and grid conditions to determine the optimal times to charge the vehicle and discharge stored energy back to the grid,"" the automaker said.

Toyota is also running similar pilot programs with other utilities across the country, including San Diego Gas & Electric and Pepco in Maryland. In doing so, the company is monitoring what those local energy markets' needs actually are, and what customers will need as well.

Generally, with V2G programs, EV drivers hook their cars up to a special charger like this one that is designed to send energy back into the grid. The local electric utility itself must also be set up to do this. When deemed necessary, energy from a car will be transmitted into the grid to support area power, and drivers often get a credit for helping out—and they can opt out or unplug at any time.

It would be a sea change for power in the U.S. if every EV were to be V2G-enabled, and if every electric grid was set up to work with them in this way. But Toyota offered a startling statistic about the potential of this technology: ""Currently, more than 4 million battery electric vehicles are on U.S. roads. If all were equipped with bidirectional charging, they could collectively contribute approximately 40,000 megawatts to the grid—a power output similar to that of 40 nuclear power reactors,"" the automaker said.

While gasoline-powered cars can only send energy in one direction—into the wheels of the car itself—an EV's ability to share power could be a huge boon to the grid as energy demand rises and costs rise along with it. According to the Wall Street Journal, the U.S. Energy Department expects the average residential electricity rate to jump 4% next year, even after a 4.9% increase in 2025.

Clearly, EVs alone can't solve that problem. And Toyota itself does not currently offer any EVs with V2G or V2L capability, unlike Hyundai, Nissan, Ford, General Motors and others. But it seems inevitable that Toyota will jump in eventually.

And as this scales, it could be more beneficial than many people realize. “By enabling bidirectional charging, we’re exploring how we can help customers potentially save money while also reducing carbon emissions from the grid,"" Christopher Yang, senior vice president of Enterprise Strategy & Solutions at Toyota Motor North America, said in a statement. And that, he said, is ""a win-win for drivers and the environment.”

Wind + solar represent almost one-fifth of total US electrical generation – a larger share than that provided by either coal or nuclear power.
Between January 1 and October 31, 2025, utility-scale solar capacity grew by 19,477.6-MW while an additional 4,837.7-MW was provided by small-scale solar.
EIA foresees continued strong solar growth, with even more utility-scale solar capacity - 36,071.9-MW - being added in the next twelve months.
Moreover, the installed capacity of utility-scale and small-scale solar combined (244,308.6-MW) would surpass that of wind (166,260.3-MW).","During the first ten months of 2025, solar and battery storage dominated growth among competing energy sources. Moreover, all net new generating capacity in 2026 is forecast to be provided by renewable energy sources and batteries.

EIA’s latest monthly “Electric Power Monthly” report (with data through October 31, 2025), once again confirms that solar is the fastest growing among the major sources of US electricity.

In October alone, electrical generation by utility-scale solar (i.e., >1-megawatt (MW)) expanded by 23.3 percent compared to October 2024 while “estimated” small-scale (e.g., rooftop) solar PV increased by 12.6 percent. Combined, they grew by 20.6 percent and provided 9.1 percent of the nation’s electrical output during the month, up from 7.8 percent a year ago.

Moreover, utility-scale solar thermal and photovoltaic expanded by 34.5 percent while that from small-scale systems rose by 11.3 percent during the first ten months of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. The combination of utility-scale and small-scale solar increased by almost a third (28.1 percent) and produced a bit over 9.0 percent (utility-scale: 6.86 percent; small-scale: 2.16 percent) of total US electrical generation for January-October - up from 7.2 percent a year earlier.

Similarly, solar-generated electricity year-to-date (YTD) easily surpassed - by over 67 percent - the output of the nation’s hydropower plants (5.4 percent of total generation). In October alone, solar-generated electricity nearly doubled hydro’s output. In fact, in both October and YTD, solar produced significantly more electricity than hydropower, biomass, and geothermal combined.

Wind continues to hold the lead among renewables. Wind turbines across the US produced almost a tenth (9.9 percent) of US electricity in the first ten months of 2025 – an increase of 1.1 percent compared to the same period a year earlier and 84 percent more than hydropower.

Wind + solar represent almost one-fifth of total US electrical generation – a larger share than that provided by either coal or nuclear power.

During the first ten months of 2025, electrical generation by wind plus utility-scale and small-scale solar increased by 12.4 percent and provided almost a fifth (18.9 percent) of the US total, up from 17.3 percent during the first ten months of 2024.

Further, the combination of wind and solar provided 16.6 percent more electricity than did coal during the first ten months of this year, and 10.8 percent more than the nation’s nuclear power plants. In fact, while solar and wind expanded, nuclear-generated electricity experienced zero growth.

Electrical output YTD by the mix of all renewables was almost 26 percent of total US generation.

The mix of all renewables (i.e., wind and solar plus hydropower, biomass and geothermal) produced 8.6 percent more electricity in January-October than they did a year ago and provided (25.7 percent) of total US electricity production compared to 24.3 percent twelve months earlier.

Renewables’ share of electrical generation is now second to only that of natural gas whose electrical output actually dropped by 3.6 percent during the first ten months of 2025.

During the past year, solar and battery storage have dominated capacity additions, coupled with a strong showing by wind.

Between January 1 and October 31, 2025, utility-scale solar capacity grew by 19,477.6-MW while an additional 4,837.7-MW was provided by small-scale solar. EIA foresees continued strong solar growth, with even more utility-scale solar capacity - 36,071.9-MW - being added in the next twelve months.

Explosive growth was also experienced by battery storage, which grew by 45.0 percent since the beginning of the year and added 12,150.3-MW of new capacity. EIA also notes that planned battery capacity additions during the next 12 months total 21,940.4-MW - a further increase of 56 percent.

Wind also made a strong showing since January 1, adding 3,796.0-MW, while planned capacity additions over the next year total 9,567.0-MW (on-shore) plus 800.0-MW (off-shore).

On the other hand, during the past ten months, natural gas capacity increased by only 3,479.6-MW and nuclear power added a mere 46.0-MW. Meanwhile, coal capacity plummeted by 3,241.1-MW and petroleum-based capacity fell by an additional 476.3-MW.

Thus, since January 1 - roughly the beginning of the Trump Administration, renewable energy capacity, including battery storage, small-scale solar, hydropower, geothermal, and biomass ballooned by 40,174.4-MW while that of all fossil fuels and nuclear power combined actually declined by 218.0-MW.

In 2026, all net new generating capacity is projected to come from renewables and battery storage.

EIA forecasts the trends seen in 2025 YTD to continue and accelerate during the coming 12-month period.

Utility-scale renewables plus battery storage are projected to increase by 68,528.0-MW (EIA does not provide a forecast for small-scale solar, but the SUN DAY Campaign estimates it will provide an additional 7,200-MW).

Meanwhile, natural gas capacity will have a net increase of only 4,167.4-MW, which will be completely offset by a drop of 4,287.0-MW in coal capacity. Petroleum and “other gases” will decrease by 42.2-MW. In addition, EIA does not project any new growth for nuclear power in the coming year.

Thus, in 2026, all net new capacity growth will be attributable solely to renewables and battery storage.

Should that forecast materialise, by October 31, 2026, the mix of all renewables, including small-scale solar, would reach 504,634.6-MW - almost equal to that of natural gas (514,018.2-MW) - and account for over 36 percent of US generating capacity.

Moreover, the installed capacity of utility-scale and small-scale solar combined (244,308.6-MW) would surpass that of wind (166,260.3-MW). Solar capacity would also handily exceed that of coal (166,649.5-MW) and more than double that of nuclear power (98,437.2-MW) although the latter two sources would still have significantly higher capacity factors.

“As 2025 draws to a close, it is clear that - notwithstanding the roadblocks created by the Trump Administration - growth by renewable energy sources and battery storage has greatly outpaced fossil fuels and nuclear power” said the SUN DAY Campaign's executive director Ken Bossong. “Moreover, it now appears highly possible that renewables and batteries could account for 100 percent of net new capacity additions in 2026.”

The SUN DAY Campaign is a non-profit research and educational organization founded in 1992 to support a rapid transition to 100 percent reliance on sustainable energy technologies as a cost-effective alternative to nuclear power and fossil fuels and as a solution to climate change.

,Texas Environment,2025-12-29 15:43:50+00:00,Deceleration,"Feds Still Ignoring Rio Grande LNG Air Pollution and Health Impacts, New Lawsuit Claims","Gaige Davila, Deceleration Staff, Greg Harman, Marisol Cortez",,,,,https://deceleration.news/rio-grande-lng-air-pollution-and-health-impacts-new-lawsuit/,"Federal regulators overseeing the Rio Grande LNG project outside of Port Isabel and Brownsville, Texas, are still failing to consider the operation’s anticipated air pollution and the resulting impact on public health, according to a new lawsuit.
Circuit Court, the same court that canceled Rio Grande LNG’s FERC approval last year.
That’s still the case, according to this new lawsuit, even after FERC completed a court-ordered supplemental environmental impact statement (SEIS) of the Rio Grande LNG project this summer.
What FERC didn’t include, as noted in the lawsuit, was Rio Grande LNG growing from a 5-train to a 6-train facility, possibly even larger.
FERC says that the Rio Grande LNG project complies with the Clean Air Act.","Federal regulators overseeing the Rio Grande LNG project outside of Port Isabel and Brownsville, Texas, are still failing to consider the operation’s anticipated air pollution and the resulting impact on public health, according to a new lawsuit.

Earthjustice, the Sierra Club, the City of Port Isabel, and the South Texas Environmental Justice Network sued the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) earlier this month for approving the Rio Grande LNG project.

The Laguna Madre area is the last region of the Texas coastline without an operating LNG plant. It has thereby avoided the pollution and environmental damage seen across the wider Gulf Coast from such facilities.

All of the operating LNG plants have violated the Clean Air Act at least once, as Deceleration has reported. Some have also violated the Clean Water Act. They often release emissions imperceptible to the human eye.

This is the third time FERC has approved the project, once again after being sued for not properly measuring how the project will impact nearby lower-income communities of color. The first lawsuit was filed in 2021.

The groups filed their lawsuit in the D.C. Circuit Court, the same court that canceled Rio Grande LNG’s FERC approval last year. The court at that time said that FERC’s environmental analysis was “deficient” under the National Environmental Policy Act.

That’s still the case, according to this new lawsuit, even after FERC completed a court-ordered supplemental environmental impact statement (SEIS) of the Rio Grande LNG project this summer. FERC approved the project again in August 2025.

“FERC has given its third attempt to reapprove the project, and they still haven’t fixed the problems the court identified the first time,” Nathan Matthews, senior attorney at Earthjustice and representing the groups and city in the lawsuit, told Deceleration.

Those problems, according to the lawsuit, include FERC not thoroughly investigating how Rio Grande LNG’s pollution would impact regional air quality and not incorporating Rio Grande LNG’s supposed carbon capture system into its analysis, despite the company saying it is still pursuing one.

What’s notable this time around is FERC’s claim that it is no longer obligated to consider how Rio Grande LNG could harm the low-income communities of color near it. Nearly all LNG facilities across the U.S. Gulf Coast are in communities with high poverty rates, according to U.S. Census data.

FERC cited the Trump administration’s executive orders to “unleash” the oil and gas industry and end “illegal discrimination” as its reason for not considering how nearby “environmental justice communities,” or lower-income communities of color, would be harmed by the project.

In approving the project for a third time, FERC said the project’s economic benefits outweigh the negatives, the latter of which, according to the regulator, include people being able to see the facility and an increase in particulate matter drifting into a nearby wildlife refuge.

What FERC didn’t include, as noted in the lawsuit, was Rio Grande LNG growing from a 5-train to a 6-train facility, possibly even larger. (An LNG “train” is a liquefaction unit that produces LNG. The sixth proposed Rio Grande train, for which NextDecades anticipates requesting a permit in 2026, would increase production by 6 million tons of LNG per year—allowing for a total of 426 LNG tanker visits to the site per year.)

FERC says that the Rio Grande LNG project complies with the Clean Air Act. But that doesn’t mean that operations will stay within the limits of its state-issued air permit or federal standards.

As Deceleration wrote last month, the Environmental Integrity Project recently used regulator data to show how every operating LNG facility in the U.S. has violated its air permit at least once; one Louisiana facility did so thousands of times in a year. Optical gas imaging cameras have shown facilities emit from more than just their flare stacks.

“Even if the terminal doesn’t violate any of the Clean Air Act standards, said Earthjustice’s Mathews, “it’s still going to be a lot more pollution in the surrounding communities, and that’s going to cause harm to those communities, regardless of whether we look at who those communities are.”

Matthews said the groups have not decided whether they will pursue an order to stop construction at the site. A similar request last year was denied by the court. Though it could be months before the federal court takes up the new lawsuit, Matthews said. Last year’s court ruling came a little more than a year after the groups appealed FERC’s second approval.

NextDecade did not respond to a request for comment.

The groups’ lawsuit also names the Rio Bravo Pipeline, a portion of which runs through or near land owned by the Carrizo/Comecrudo Tribe of Texas.

“Once again, the FERC is not doing a full environmental review nor consultation with our Tribe, doing everything they can to give the LNG companies anything they want at the expense of our Tribe and our people,” Tribal Chairman Juan Mancias said in a press release.

NextDecade also has a storage site near the tribe’s land just outside of Brownsville, much of it filled with pipeline segments and construction machinery.

Similarly, Commonwealth LNG in Hackberry, Louisiana, which is owned by a Houston-based company, had their state-level authorization revoked by a local court in October for failing to consider its environmental justice impacts. But last month the state issued another permit, saying that “the benefits of this project outweigh the costs to the community.”

NextDecade says it expects to ship out its first gas cargoes from its three-train facility by 2027. The project is already affecting traffic on Highway 48. Locals complain of fast drivers and congestion.

The City of Port Isabel has vocally opposed LNG projects since the companies started scoping out the area more than a decade ago, with resolutions against their development and against granting them tax abatements.

Port Isabel’s City Manager, Jared Hockema, who has been with the city since it started opposing LNG development, says delaying the project has been worth it.

“That’s a generation of kids that grew up without air pollution because of those efforts. And that’s certainly worthwhile,” Hockema told Deceleration. “And what it reminds us of is that in life, there’s always struggle and progress is not permanent. You have to fight to keep it.”",https://d3l0i86vhnepo5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/28214757/rio-grande-lng-feature-1024x576.png,N,,2025-12-29 11:59:13.891587

,North Carolina and Evs,2025-12-29 15:24:52+00:00,The State,EV sales are way down. Here's why that might not be a big deal. | The State,Tik Root for Grist,,,,,https://www.thestate.com/news/business/article314030303.html,"Across the country, dealers sold about 20 percent fewer used electric cars in October than in September and saw a staggering 50 percent drop for new ones, according to the latest data.
""We're definitely gonna see a slowdown,"" Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive, told Grist.
In China, Valdez Streaty said, electric versions of cars often already cost less than their conventional counterparts.
And, like Valdez Streaty, she points to continued downward pressure on used prices expanding adoption of the technology.
In total, Valdez Streaty said, 17 states offer EV purchase incentives.","Electric vehicle sales have cratered.

Across the country, dealers sold about 20 percent fewer used electric cars in October than in September and saw a staggering 50 percent drop for new ones, according to the latest data. No one was surprised. Congress voted in July to end the federal tax credits that helped consumers afford them on Sept. 30, years before they were supposed to expire. That led to a rush of purchases before the deadline and a precipitous drop afterward.

The question now is whether this dip is a sign of a prolonged slump or a mere blip in an otherwise upward trajectory. While only time will tell, many analysts believe that electric vehicle adoption in the United States will continue to grow - albeit maybe not at the same pace seen before Congress killed the credits and automakers started second-guessing themselves.

""We're definitely gonna see a slowdown,"" Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive, told Grist. Eliminating the federal credit of $7,500 on new EVs and $4,500 on used ones is certainly taking a toll. But the price of batteries, and thus cars, also continues to come down. Used models are becoming more of a bargain, too. As of this fall, the price gap between used EVs and their gas-powered equivalents had narrowed to just $900. In China, Valdez Streaty said, electric versions of cars often already cost less than their conventional counterparts.

""It's not going to just stop,"" she said of momentum in the United States. ""It's going to be gradual adoption, but I still think we're going forward.""

Even with the decline, EVs are on pace for record sales this year and make up around 8 percent of the overall market. That is up from around 2.3 percent five years ago and a meager 0.66 percent a decade back. Valdez Streaty expects this trend to continue, as does Liz Najman, director of market insights at Recurrent, a company that provides data about EVs. She said that there are a slew of new, more affordable models, including revamped versions of the Nissan Leaf and Chevrolet Bolt, coming to market over the next year that should help drive demand.

By the end of 2026, there will be around 16 electric models available for less than $42,000 new, compared to half that this year, Najman said. And, like Valdez Streaty, she points to continued downward pressure on used prices expanding adoption of the technology. Most notably, dealerships offered a glut of lease deals on EVs in recent years, and many of those cars are approaching the end of their terms and will soon hit used lots.

""There are a lot of options for people,"" said Najam, who is optimistic about the industry's prospects. Kathy Harris, with the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council, notes that EV owners don't need to buy gas, and they avoid some basic maintenance, like oil changes. That makes cars with cords more attractive. Overall, she said, ""there are significant total cost of ownership benefits even with the higher upfront price.""

That said, the market is certainly fighting headwinds.

In addition to rescinding consumer tax credits, Republicans in Congress also stripped away many manufacturing and other corporate incentives for battery or vehicle manufacturing. They have also attempted to undercut federal fuel economy and pollution standards, which incentivize production of low- and zero-emissions vehicles. In that same bill, for example, Congress eliminated the penalties for manufacturers that violate the Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, standards. This allows companies to produce more profitable yet less fuel-efficient vehicles, like SUVs and pickup trucks, without worry of being fined. Under President Donald Trump, the Environmental Protection Agency also revoked California's waiver to set its own emissions standards.

A number of these changes are currently the subject of litigation (California, for example, has sued the Trump administration to preserve its tailpipe rules), and analysts are watching these cases closely. The same goes for Trump's sweeping tariffs, which have also put upward pressure on the cost of all new vehicles. EVs could be particularly hard-hit, as batteries generally come from abroad and can make up as much as 40 percent of the value of the car.

All of this uncertainty has led several manufacturers to announce rollbacks in their EV plans. But Najman points out that many have stood their ground, too; she called out Hyundai in particular for expanding its EV offerings. ""These are companies that have already made their commitment to electric vehicles clear both in terms of words and actions,"" she said. This blip is ""not really going to slow down their success.""

Some states are trying to step in to fill the void the federal government has left. Since those credits went away, Colorado and Connecticut have raised their credits or rebates (by $3,000 and $500, respectively). In total, Valdez Streaty said, 17 states offer EV purchase incentives. And, the United States aside, Harris believes that manufacturers will keep producing more, and cheaper, EVs, because that's what customers in the rest of the world want as well.

""It's quite clear that this is still where the market is going,"" she said. ""I'm hopeful.""

Released this month, the biennial report, known as a greenhouse gas inventory, is the first to estimate the effects of the recent federal rollbacks on Colorado’s climate action plan.
“In terms of our GHG emissions trajectory, the impact is not as large as I feared it might be,” Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office, said in an interview.
Its trajectory towards the next target, a 50 percent cut by 2030, is similarly about two years behind schedule, at least for now.
While the rate of growth has slowed, annual carbon emissions have continued to rise globally, reaching another all-time high in 2024.","When Colorado Democrats took full control of state government nearly seven years ago, one of the party’s top priorities in the General Assembly was the passage of a climate action plan that would commit the state to the ambitious cuts to greenhouse gas emissions recommended by climate scientists.

House Bill 19-1261, signed by Governor Jared Polis in 2019, marked the first time Colorado had codified greenhouse gas targets in state law — and the end of calendar year 2025 is the deadline to meet the first of the goals, a 26 percent reduction in statewide emissions compared to 2005 levels.

Colorado will fall short of that goal.

That outcome has been all but certain for the last few years, as the state struggled to achieve the needed cuts, especially when it came to vehicle emissions, and state officials have previously acknowledged their efforts to meet the 2025 goal were at least a year behind schedule. The target slipped further out of reach this year as President Donald Trump’s administration and Republicans in Congress rolled back an array of clean energy incentives, including tax credits for electric cars and home heating upgrades.

Still, Colorado’s top energy official said he was “pleasantly surprised” by the findings of the state’s latest comprehensive emissions report. Released this month, the biennial report, known as a greenhouse gas inventory, is the first to estimate the effects of the recent federal rollbacks on Colorado’s climate action plan.

“In terms of our GHG emissions trajectory, the impact is not as large as I feared it might be,” Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office, said in an interview. “What the latest inventory shows is that it basically pushes us back (another) year.”

That means the state now expects to meet its 2025 target — about 103 million tons of carbon emissions, a 26 percent cut from about 140 million tons two decades ago — in 2027. Its trajectory towards the next target, a 50 percent cut by 2030, is similarly about two years behind schedule, at least for now.

“There’s a lot of uncertainty about what the federal government is going to do in the future,” Toor cautioned. “There is a lot more work that we’re going to need to do to make sure that we are accurately capturing the effects of all of the attacks on clean energy…from the Trump administration.”

Colorado’s Approach

Climate scientists have warned that to avert the most catastrophic impacts of global warming, governments around the world must cut greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030 and reach net-zero emissions by midcentury.

The world is badly off track to meet those targets. While the rate of growth has slowed, annual carbon emissions have continued to rise globally, reaching another all-time high in 2024.

Colorado’s emissions peaked around 2010 and had declined by about 16 percent from 2005 levels as of 2023, the latest year for which historical estimates are available, according to the new inventory.

Polis’ administration has embraced what it describes as a “whole-of-government approach” to climate action, pursuing a wide range of policies across different emissions sectors and regulatory bodies, including the Public Utilities Commission, the Department of Transportation, the Air Quality Control Commission and the Energy and Carbon Management Commission.

That approach hasn’t been without its critics among climate and environmental advocates, who warned as early as 2020 that the state wasn’t doing enough to meet its 2025 and 2030 goals. Advocates have been repeatedly left frustrated by the scope and ambition of the Polis administration’s climate regulations, especially at the AQCC.

U.S. Senator Michael Bennet, a Democratic candidate for governor in 2026, on December 9 announced a climate plan centered on a “cap-and-invest” program, reviving a proposal that some influential advocacy groups had hoped to enact through the AQCC after HB-1261’s passage seven years ago.

A separate report released this month by a coalition of Colorado environmental groups emphasized the need for the state to make “strategic near-term capital investments” to get back on track with its emissions goals.

“Coloradans see the impacts of climate change firsthand, in the form of more intense drought, more frequent wildfires and longer hotter summers,” Stacy Tellinghuisen, deputy director of policy development with Western Resource Advocates, said in a briefing on the new report. “Those impacts translate into real costs, but taking action — enacting forward looking policies to address climate pollution — has benefits for equity, for affordability and for air quality.”",https://www.westword.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/xcel-comanche-station-woodruff-e1767020717251.jpeg,N,,2025-12-29 10:59:49.918932

Every passing day reveals a fresh crop of news that touches our city, our region and our lives. And rest assured, the Free Press remains “On Guard” to keep you, our valued readers, informed.

I began writing this note as Free Press health reporter Kristen Jordan Shamus rushed off to 52-4 District Court in Troy to cover the preliminary hearings of four people charged in the death of 5-year-old Thomas Cooper inside a hyperbaric oxygen chamber.

Days passed, and more news followed: JC Reindl looked into a proposed data center in Southfield – one of many popping up across the state. Meanwhile, Lansing Bureau Chief Paul Egan reported on the impact of the House Appropriations committee vote to reject $645 million in ""work project"" requests from the State Budget Office to carry over funding into the 2026 fiscal year.

Later in the month, sports reporter Tony Garcia and investigative reporter Dave Boucher teamed up to stitch together what led to the dramatic firing and arrest of U-M football coach Sherrone Moore.

And on … and on.

Our Free Press team stands firmly ready to tackle the never-ending news cycle. But covering the news with urgency and persistence on all platforms is not our only objective. Our aim is to also tell the full and diverse story of our region and our time; we strive to shine a light in dark corners, to decode the indecipherable, and to inspire and entertain along the way.

For many, 2025 has been a year of tremendous change – especially in the national political sphere. As President Donald J. Trump launched his second-term agenda, the Free Press newsroom led a statewide initiative – “100 Days, 100 Michigan Voices” — seeking to elevate the voices of Michiganders. We partnered with the Lansing State Journal and Michigan’s Center for Community Journalism to conduct more than 100 face-to-face interviews, asking Michiganders their opinions of Trump’s second term in the White House, and how those opinions intersected with how they voted. We shared a robust range of their thoughts in text and on video to deepen our relationship and conversation with the audiences that we cover.

Next year, expect the Free Press to continue to seek out innovative ways to center our audiences and their diverse stories, lifestyles and opinions within our coverage. In this digital media era of hot takes and loose facts, it is vital for trusted local news sources like the Free Press to be informed by the lived experience of real people.

As we tick down to the end of the year, we must acknowledge the sunset of the Joint Operating Agreement between the Detroit Free Press and The Detroit News. While the newsrooms were always separate and competitive, the decades-long agreement allowing combined business functions ends this month.

In mid-January, the Homestyle section and the News’ opinion section will no longer be available in the Free Press print and e-newspapers. However, starting in February, Free Press subscribers will enjoy an enhanced Sunday news product, which will include more suburban news, new home and garden content, more entertainment, an expanded editorial section and the Free Press’ trademark investigative journalism. We look forward to sharing a fresh approach and providing readers with more of the content that matters to them.

I started this note in the midst of news. And as I close, news still swirls: Investigative journalist Violet Ikonomova covered a news conference where Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan said the Detroit Police Department and state environmental regulators are looking into two companies believed to have dumped toxic dirt into Detroit neighborhood demolition sites. Auto critic Mark Phelan put the finishing touches on his picks for the annual Car, Truck and Utility vehicle of the year, while autos team newbie Liam Rappleye waxed poetic about a custom Chrysler mash-up of minivans whose frontend and backend are mirror images.

And on and on ...

That’s all the time Donald Trump needed to crush the only major climate law the United States ever managed to pass. It was swift work, using a sledgehammer and not a scalpel, and now the energy transition will have to make do with the fragments of the law that remain.

The words bleak and dispiriting come to mind. How else to describe the fact that the U.S. entered the year implementing an ambitious if inadequate decarbonization law, and is now exiting 2025 with that law all but repealed?

But there were also some reasons to be hopeful about the energy transition this year — if you knew where to look.

Let’s start with the numbers. During a year full of headline-grabbing destruction of U.S. clean energy policy, renewables still led the way. Through November, a whopping 92% of all new electricity capacity built in the U.S. came in the form of solar, batteries, and wind power. Electric vehicle sales hit a record, too — nearly 440,000 in the third quarter of the year — though the surge was driven in large part by consumers rushing to buy EVs before the disappearance of a federal tax credit axed by Trump.

There were also intriguing moments of alignment between Trump’s “energy dominance” agenda and the transition away from fossil fuels. Geothermal and nuclear are two sources of carbon-free energy that the administration has, for whatever reasons, deemed desirable. So while the One Big Beautiful Bill Act eviscerated much of President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, it spared tax credits for geothermal systems. And Trump has not only preserved Biden-era funding for nuclear projects but expanded it — possibly by orders of magnitude if an $80 billion plan for partially state-owned nuclear reactors actually happens.

The most important thing we saw this year is that Trump simply can’t stop the energy transition. Sure, he can slow it. He already has. But try as the administration might, there are forces at play bigger and more stubborn even than politics.

To be specific: Electricity demand is growing quickly in the U.S., and clean energy is the least expensive and most readily available way to keep pace.

The Trump administration would certainly prefer to meet rising demand with coal and gas, but in many cases it’s simply impractical.

Coal is increasingly the most expensive form of electricity. Gas, for better or for worse, certainly will help meet some of this new demand — but it faces very real supply-chain constraints. Gas turbines are sold out among major manufacturers, with wait times stretching as long as seven years.

When the country is clamoring for more electrons and voters are increasingly upset about rising power bills, and the only thing that can be built quickly is solar and storage, renewables will simply have to be built. (They’ll just cost more than they would have without Trump.)",https://media.zenfs.com/en/canary_media_articles_453/6f3dc22dfd913cc623114badf7171a4f,N,,2025-12-29 11:59:09.425898

While fully electric cars and trucks made up 10% of all auto sales in the United States in the third quarter, another 15% of transactions were for hybrid vehicles.
Kunes is even more bullish; he figures in the near future, more than half of his business will be hybrid vehicles.
Ultimately, hybrid cars and trucks may prove to be as powerful as federal incentives in fueling EV sales.
In September, some 57% of car shoppers were considering a fully electric auto, according to JD Power.","Like most U.S. car dealers, Scott Kunes has some electric vehicle whiplash.

In the third quarter, he sold EVs like ice cream at the beach. However, after federal purchase incentives expired at the end of September, those models have been tough to move at his company’s 50 or so Midwest stores selling about 20 different brands, from Mitsubishi to Mercedes-Benz.

But buyers aren’t necessarily turning to gas guzzlers. On Kunes’ lots, hybrid vehicles are in high demand, a preference that’s playing out across the country. While fully electric cars and trucks made up 10% of all auto sales in the United States in the third quarter, another 15% of transactions were for hybrid vehicles.

The EV market is slowing in the United States, but analysts expect hybrid sales to continue accelerating. CarGurus Inc., a digital listings platform that covers most of the U.S. auto market, predicts nearly one in six new cars next year will be a hybrid, as automakers greenlight more and better machines with the technology. And though these cars and trucks will still burn gas, they will quietly move the needle on both transportation emissions and the transition to fully electric cars and trucks.

Kunes is even more bullish; he figures in the near future, more than half of his business will be hybrid vehicles. “We have so much investment in EV and battery technology, and we need to figure out the best possible use of it,” he said. “There’s a lot to be said for hybrids becoming the most dominant powertrain out there and real soon.”

With federal purchase incentives worth up to $7,500 wiped out by the Trump administration, EV sales were expected to plunge 30% in the fourth quarter and remain flat through much of next year. But Americans worried about affordability see hybrids as a pragmatic way to cut fuel expenses and emissions.

“They offer consumers a little bit of everything,” said Peter Nagle, associate director of Americas demand forecasting at S&P Global Mobility. “I think the demand is only going to keep going from here. Their utilitarian nature “might appeal more to rural, red state customers,” he added.

CarGurus calls hybrids the success story of 2025. Indeed, the fastest-selling car in the country this year has been the Hyundai Palisade Hybrid; it sat on lots for fewer than 14 days on average.

Of the roughly 390 distinct car models on the U.S. market, roughly 87 are available with hybrid technology, nearly 50% more options than drivers had five years ago, according to Edmunds.com. While carmakers have struggled to turn a profit on fully electric vehicles, analysts say their investments in batteries and electric motors are helping them sell more and better hybrid machines.

It’s also increasingly difficult to discern a hybrid from a solely gas-powered model, said Scott Hardman, assistant director of the Electric Vehicle Research Center at the University of California at Davis. Carmakers today often don’t even label a hybrid as such. Consider Toyota’s RAV4, one of the best-selling vehicles in America. The 2026 version of the SUV comes in six different variants, all of which include an electric motor and a gas tank.

“A hybrid is just a regular car now,” Hardman said. “You can buy one by accident.”

Kunes, the Midwest dealer, said most of his customers don’t pay much attention to how the vehicle propels itself; they’re just looking for the most affordable option. “People don’t necessarily come in looking for a hybrid vehicle,” he explained, “but they don’t mind taking one.”

While not as clean as an electric vehicle, hybrids offer sneaky carbon cuts as well. Americans, on average, drive about 38 miles a day, which requires about one gallon of gas in most basic hybrids. Contemporary plug-in hybrids, which can run on all-battery power, can cover almost that entire range without the gas engine kicking in. And a small crowd of cars will do even better, stretching their batteries well over 40 miles per charge.

All told, hybridization can reduce the carbon dioxide emissions of a vehicle by roughly 20% to 30%, according to the International Council on Clean Transportation.

And Americans will soon have even more hybrids to choose from. As automakers retool their paths to electrification, many are doubling down on hybrids and acknowledging that they will be more than a brief stepping stone in the transition to full EVs.

This month, Ford Motor Co. said it would scrap its electric F-150 Lightning pickup and use its assembly lines to stamp out a new extended-range hybrid pickup, in part because it had invested so much in battery capacity. By 2030, Ford expects half of its global sales to be fully or partially electrified vehicles.

Toyota Motor Corp. is already at that level, in part thanks to all those hybrid RAV4s. Meanwhile, Honda Motor Co. Ltd. is steering for the same lane, basing its entire business on hybrids until at least 2030.

Ultimately, hybrid cars and trucks may prove to be as powerful as federal incentives in fueling EV sales. Around one-third of hybrid drivers transition to a fully electric vehicle when they next switch cars. In September, some 57% of car shoppers were considering a fully electric auto, according to JD Power. However, among hybrid households, that share was almost 70%.

“I don’t necessarily think you buy that car and fall in love with that tiny electric motor,” Hardman said. “But after a while, people think, ‘Actually, driving electric is pretty nice. One thing I don’t like about my hybrid is when the engine kicks on, or I have to go to a gas station.’”","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/02/04/PDTN/78220196007-ap-25023690791910.jpg?crop=3496,1966,x2,y290&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-29 11:00:26.774781

United States, a case that could further redefine the boundaries of federal agency authority and reshape how regulations affecting business, labor, and environmental compliance are crafted and enforced. While the dispute does not center on energy or environmental policy directly, its outcome could influence how future climate, labor, and ESG-related rules are challenged—and upheld.

At issue is whether federal agencies exceeded their statutory authority in issuing regulations that the Chamber argues impose obligations not clearly authorized by Congress. The case arrives amid broader judicial skepticism toward expansive administrative interpretation, continuing a trend that has already altered the regulatory landscape.

The Legal Question at the Center of the Case

The Chamber’s challenge focuses on whether agencies may rely on broad or implied statutory language to justify far-reaching rules, or whether Congress must speak with greater specificity when delegating regulatory power. The case builds on recent precedent signaling that courts may no longer defer as readily to agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes.

This framework places renewed emphasis on the “major questions” doctrine, under which courts require clear congressional authorization before allowing agencies to regulate issues of vast economic or political significance.

Why Business Groups Are Watching Closely

For business and industry groups, the case represents an opportunity to rein in regulatory expansion that has increasingly occurred through rulemaking rather than legislation. The Chamber argues that uncertainty around agency authority complicates compliance planning, increases litigation risk, and exposes companies to shifting obligations that can change across administrations.

A ruling favoring the Chamber could embolden additional challenges to federal rules across labor, environmental, financial, and disclosure regimes—particularly where agencies rely on long-standing but broadly interpreted statutory mandates.

Regulatory Implications

Although the case is not an environmental dispute on its face, the implications for sustainability-related regulation are significant. Many climate, emissions, and disclosure rules depend on agency interpretations of statutes enacted decades ago, often before modern ESG frameworks existed.

If the Court tightens limits on agency discretion, regulators may face higher hurdles when advancing new environmental or climate-related requirements without explicit congressional direction. That could slow the pace of regulatory change or shift responsibility back to lawmakers—introducing new uncertainty for companies attempting to plan long-term sustainability strategies.

What This Means for Compliance and Risk Teams

For corporate legal, compliance, and sustainability teams, the case underscores the importance of monitoring not just individual regulations, but the legal foundations underpinning them. A decision narrowing agency authority could:

Increase regulatory volatility as existing rules are challenged

Delay or invalidate forthcoming ESG or climate disclosures

Create uneven compliance environments across jurisdictions

At the same time, a ruling upholding agency authority would reaffirm the current regulatory model, reinforcing the role of federal agencies as primary drivers of policy implementation.

A Broader Signal from the Court

Taken together with recent administrative law decisions, Chamber of Commerce v. United States reflects a judiciary increasingly willing to police the separation of powers between Congress and the executive branch. Regardless of outcome, the case adds another layer of legal context that businesses must factor into regulatory forecasting.

For now, the case serves as a reminder that regulatory risk is no longer confined to rulemaking dockets alone—it is increasingly shaped by the courts that determine how far agencies may go.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20251228-142146-411-The%20image%20depicts%20a%20gavel%20resting%20on%20top%20of%20a%20stack%20of%20legal%20documents%2C%20symbolizing%20the%20Supreme%20Court%27s%20role%20in%20determining%20federal%20agency%20authority..jpg,N,,2025-12-29 11:13:06.890782

Because renewable propane is chemically identical to conventional propane, ports can use it in existing propane engines, fueling dispensers, and storage systems.
Expanding access to renewable propane While renewable propane is already in use today, its production is growing rapidly to meet rising demand.
According to the World Liquid Gas Association, renewable propane could meet half the world’s demand for propane by 2050.
Researchers are investigating new renewable feedstocks and refining manufacturing techniques to make the production of renewable propane cleaner and more scalable.","With lower emissions and proven reliability, it’s the ready-now solution for cleaner port operations.

As demand for cleaner energy grows, port authorities and terminal operators face the challenge of finding environmentally friendly options without increasing budgets or sacrificing productivity. Propane has met these performance criteria at ports for decades, powering everything from terminal tractors and forklifts to shore power and generators. It reduces emissions while ensuring critical operational uptime, even when ports are experiencing peak volumes.

Now, renewable propane, an ultra-low-carbon energy source, is available to help ports reduce emissions even further. Renewable propane offers the same benefits as conventional propane — reliability, portability, and power — but with significantly fewer emissions when compared with other energy sources.

What is renewable propane?

Renewable propane is produced from feedstocks such as camelina plant oil, used cooking oil, vegetable oil, soybean oil, animal fats, and tallow. The result is the power and portability of conventional propane with a greatly reduced carbon footprint.

The carbon intensity of renewable propane — the amount of carbon emitted for every unit of energy produced — is up to four times lower than conventional propane and five times lower than diesel at the point of combustion. The fuel ranks among the lowest in carbon intensity, with a score between 20 and 43 (depending on the feedstock). Compare that with a score of 79 for conventional propane and natural gas — both of which are 20 percent cleaner than gasoline and diesel (each rated at 100). At 130, the average carbon intensity score of the U.S. electrical grid is the highest among all options when considering total lifecycle emissions.

Both renewable propane and conventional propane offer port authorities the benefit of reduced emissions beyond greenhouse gases. A real-world study conducted by PERC found propane port tractors produce 99 percent fewer nitrogen oxides and nearly eliminate particulate matter emissions compared with diesel. As port authorities look for ways to improve their sustainability, renewable and conventional propane are well positioned to provide fleets with the clean power they need without compromising reliability or performance.

Clean energy without tradeoffs

Ports operate on tight schedules and tighter margins. There’s little room for downtime or costly transitions to new fuel systems. That’s why port authorities and terminal operators need environmentally friendly solutions that don’t compromise performance or wipe out profits.

Because renewable propane is chemically identical to conventional propane, ports can use it in existing propane engines, fueling dispensers, and storage systems. For ports already using propane, adopting renewable propane is a seamless process that won’t pause operations and doesn’t require any new training, equipment, or infrastructure costs. For ports new to propane, setup is just a fraction of those associated with electric or other alternative fuel systems.

This also means port authorities experience all the same benefits of conventional propane when they upgrade to renewable, including reliability. Propane is stored on site, so it’s always ready when needed, even during grid interruptions. Refueling is fast and efficient, ensuring material handling equipment stays online during peak periods.

Most importantly, renewable propane allows ports to reduce emissions today without waiting for future technologies to catch up. It offers a realistic, cost-effective path to cleaner operations while maintaining the uptime, flexibility, and performance that port operators depend on every day.

Expanding access to renewable propane

While renewable propane is already in use today, its production is growing rapidly to meet rising demand. The U.S. produces more than 4.5 million gallons annually, and that number is expected to reach 100 million gallons within the next few years. As more production facilities come online and supply chains mature, renewable propane will become an even more accessible and cost-competitive option for ports. According to the World Liquid Gas Association, renewable propane could meet half the world’s demand for propane by 2050.

This growth is driven by market demand for cleaner fuels and technological innovation. Researchers are investigating new renewable feedstocks and refining manufacturing techniques to make the production of renewable propane cleaner and more scalable. Camelina, a non-food oilseed cover crop, is a particularly promising source for renewable propane.

Camelina produces 40 percent oil, twice that of soybeans, and the remaining meal and husks are used for mulch and livestock feed to maximize resource efficiency. Camelina-based renewable propane has one of the lowest carbon intensities, with studies showing it can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 60 percent compared to petroleum fuel.

Recent studies show that renewable propane can be produced from other nontraditional sources, including the breakdown of plastics such as polyethylene and polypropylene and the conversion of captured carbon dioxide. These methods create circular production pathways that further lower lifecycle emissions.

Moving to a clean energy future

Above all, port authorities are responsible for ensuring the continuity of global trade and operations. With renewable propane, they can make progress toward global emissions goals, too. Ports that want to lead the clean energy transition with confidence, performance, and reliability will find renewable propane ready when they are.",https://images.marinelink.com/images/maritime/w800/image-courtesy-166676.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 10:59:53.070976

On December 5, 2025, the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance (OECA) issued a memorandum that directs all EPA staff responsible for civil judicial and administrative enforcement activities to prioritize a ""compliance first"" approach to enforcement.

The memorandum criticizes previous enforcement approaches which pursued findings of violation or orders that prolonged negotiations and delayed actual compliance. Going forward, however, the EPA's primary focus in all inspection, investigation, and enforcement activities is ""achieving and ensuring timely compliance."" The memorandum outlines six key factors that will guide EPA staff in their compliance-first operating framework:

Compliance Assistance Toolkit. EPA will prioritize deployment of its ""compliance assistance tools,"" including proactive outreach, technical assistance, and training. EPA will also promote voluntary audits to encourage regulated entities to proactively identify and correct compliance issues.

State Partner Coordination. EPA will demonstrate ""proper deference and support"" to state and local leads who have primary jurisdiction over environmental programs, ensuring consistency in compliance determinations and in enforcement of federal environmental law.

Open Communication. EPA will maintain transparent communication with states, tribes, and regulated entities in order to avoid duplicative enforcement activities and unnecessary contradictions. EPA will also operate a ""no surprises"" framework by maintaining open communication with regulated entities throughout the inspection and enforcement process.

Finding of Violation. Findings of violation must be ""clear and unambiguous, well-tailored, and based on the 'best reading' of the relevant statute and regulation,"" which will expedite compliance and reduce time and expense in litigating interpretations that seek to broaden statutory or regulatory interpretations beyond plain meaning. If a regulated entity raises concerns regarding EPA's application of a statute or regulation to its specific case, ""such questions must be elevated immediately for further analysis.""

Compliance Requirements and Injunctive Relief. When formal enforcement is necessary, the primary focus of the strategic negotiations and litigation must be achieving timely compliance in the most efficient and economic means possible. In particular, the memorandum notes that injunctive relief provisions ""shall be based on the best, most defensible interpretation of the law,"" and rescinds previous guidance on expansive injunctive relief remedies. The memorandum also mandates a pause on the use of Supplemental Environmental Projects (SEPs) in settlements.

Reasoned Decision Making. When making decisions on noncompliance determinations and the appropriate means for achieving compliance, EPA must apply the ""LEAPS"" factors, using Law, Evidence, Analysis, Programmatic Impacts, and Stakeholder Impacts to ""ensure sound and responsive decisions.""

The memorandum is effective immediately and applies to all ongoing and future civil and administrative enforcement matters. Notably, the memorandum states that it is not legally binding but is rather ""intended to improve the internal management of EPA.""

""This policy reinforces prioritizing environmental compliance across all OECA civil judicial and administrative enforcement activities in the most efficient, most economical, and swiftest means possible, while ensuring that our actions align with the clearest, most defensible interpretations of our statutory and regulatory mandates.""

Thirty-seven per cent said it should support jobs and production specifically in Canada's auto parts industry.
More than half, 58 per cent, also supported diversification of auto manufacturing into defence manufacturing to save jobs.
""Canadians are calling for strategic investments that safeguard manufacturing jobs while strengthening the foundation for the entire automotive ecosystem.""
Meanwhile, 55 per cent of Canadians in the market for a new vehicle plan to buy an environmentally-friendly car next.","According to a survey by KPMG, six in ten Canadians plan to buy a vehicle in the next five years, and many prospective buyers aren't just paying attention to the model, but also where that vehicle was made.

The survey of 2,000 Canadians, taken between November 7 and November 17, suggests that 72 per cent believe it is either very or somewhat important to them that the vehicle is assembled or built in Canada.

""With U.S. tariffs disrupting the industry, Canadians in the market for a new vehicle are looking to the brands they trust at prices they can afford -- and increasingly, where those vehicles are built,"" said Partner and National Automotive Sector Leader at KMPG Canada, Dave Power. ""Car buyers are looking for vehicles that meet their lifestyle, are affordable, and have a positive economic impact on the country. It's not surprising that Toyota and Honda, which each have a large manufacturing presence in Ontario, resonate most with Canadian consumers.""

At the same time, Power said trust in the Detroit Big 3 is eroding as Canadians perceive a lack of commitment to keep jobs in Canada.

""As consumer concerns collide with ongoing trade tensions and tariffs threatening to upend decades of cross-border stability, Canada's automotive sector needs to carefully consider its future and what changes might be warranted,"" continued Power. ""Canadians are calling for a new automotive strategy, which prioritizes domestic manufacturing, secures jobs, provides long-term resilience, and positions Canada as a leader in electric vehicles and battery production.""

A majority of respondents stated they would support higher tariffs on Detroit 3 automakers who cut production in Canada.

Fifty-five per cent of those who responded to KPMG's survey believe Canada could become a world leader in electric vehicles, in a bid to reduce its reliance on the U.S. auto industry. Almost as many think governments should make it a priority.

""And with billions already committed to new battery and EV charging facilities in Ontario and Quebec, momentum is building toward a made-in-Canada ecosystem for cleantech exports in renewable energy, EVs, and electrification,"" added Power. ""We have everything to lead the EV transition, including critical minerals, innovation, talent, and manufacturing capacity. What is needed is a clear roadmap to accelerate Canada's leadership.""

The survey shows 60 per cent think governments should provide financial support and incentives to keep automakers building in Canada. Thirty-seven per cent said it should support jobs and production specifically in Canada's auto parts industry. Only seven per cent think jobs and production among Detroit automakers should be prioritized. Almost half of the respondents support removing tariffs on EVs from China.

More than half, 58 per cent, also supported diversification of auto manufacturing into defence manufacturing to save jobs.

""People want long-term strategy, not short-term patches,"" said Power. ""Canadians are calling for strategic investments that safeguard manufacturing jobs while strengthening the foundation for the entire automotive ecosystem.""

The survey also asked Canadians about next year's review of the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement. Seventy-two per cent fear vehicle prices will rise if Canada loses protections under the new agreement, while 51 per cent don't think Canada's automotive industry will survive without trade protections or a new trade agreement with the U.S.

KPMG's Partner, Trade and Customs, believes the review may also provide manufacturers with opportunities.

""If the CUSMA rules of origin change substantially to require even more North American content, this could have a dramatic impact on existing automotive supply chains,"" Joy Nott said. ""This disruption would require a search for new North American suppliers to replace overseas manufacturing. While disruptive and likely to increase costs, this change could also create opportunities for Canadian manufacturers to expand and diversify their business.""

Bringing new opportunities and challenges, the AI revolution is taking off and pushing power demand to new heights.
However, new natural gas plant development has slowed significantly in recent years for a variety of policy- and market-related reasons.
In the latest long-term demand outlook, PJM projects that overall power demand across its footprint will jump nearly 60 percent over the next decade.
That’s the biggest barrier to advancing American energy: permitting.","Today, our state and nation stand at a critical crossroads – one that will determine whether the U.S. continues to lead the world in affordable, reliable energy or falls behind due to bureaucratic red tape and gridlock.

Just 15 years ago, Pennsylvania produced less than 2 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas.

Now, Pennsylvania produces more than 20 billion cubic feet per day, enough to supply approximately 100 million U.S. homes with energy for one day. This surge has helped take America from a position of scarcity and dependence to one of abundance and global leadership.

In the Keystone State, natural gas and oil supports 400,000 jobs and adds $40 billion to the state’s economy every year.

Nationwide, the industry supports 10 million American jobs and contributes nearly $1.8 trillion to the U.S. GDP – about 8 percent of the entire economy. In testimony before the Pennsylvania House Republican Policy Committee’s recent public hearing on energy affordability and reliability, American Petroleum Institute‘s Vice President of Natural Gas Markets, Rob Jennings, referred to this as the “first 8 percent,” because “nothing else in the economy moves without energy.”

Energy is the foundation of our modern economy – from the days of the Industrial Revolution to the invention of the internet and now the AI era. Bringing new opportunities and challenges, the AI revolution is taking off and pushing power demand to new heights.

Many of the energy challenges we face in Pennsylvania mirror those in other regions of the country. Residential electric utility bills, for example, have risen far faster than inflation in recent years – and while some of the cost drivers are unavoidable, others are self-inflicted.

Between 2010 to 2020, gas-fired generating capacity in Pennsylvania and the rest of PJM Interconnection, the largest regional transmission organization in the U.S., surged as utilities and independent power producers responded to a tightening regional electricity market and leveraged abundant natural gas from the Marcellus shale basin. However, new natural gas plant development has slowed significantly in recent years for a variety of policy- and market-related reasons.

Although the impact of this slowdown in bringing new natural gas plants onto the grid didn’t have an immediate impact, that is changing fast amid forecasts of rapidly rising electricity demand, which is being driven by advancements in manufacturing, innovations in AI and electrification. In the latest long-term demand outlook, PJM projects that overall power demand across its footprint will jump nearly 60 percent over the next decade. Ninety-five percent of new power demand through 2030 is expected to come from data centers.

Across the Keystone State, including Cumberland, Dauphin and Lancaster counties, AI data centers and other power-intensive projects are being proposed and built, generating new economic opportunities and jobs for Pennsylvanians. But this progress also provides opportunities for Pennsylvania energy.

This growth in power demand is extraordinary, yet it is an indication of a growing economy and job creation – a generational opportunity to advance American energy and innovation.

Pennsylvania has and will continue to play a key role in powering our lives with its abundant supply of shale gas. The question is, can we build the infrastructure needed to move energy from where it’s produced to where it’s needed?

That’s the biggest barrier to advancing American energy: permitting. Meaningful, durable permitting reforms at the state and federal level are needed to allow for timely buildout of infrastructure, such as pipelines, transmission lines, natural gas storage, power plants – even roads and bridges.

Projects are often languishing in years of duplicative review or endless litigation. A pipeline that should take less than a year to permit can stretch to a decade, delaying the delivery of affordable, reliable energy that American consumers and businesses count on.

Congress must act on commonsense deadlines and predictable permitting processes to help ensure projects are built in years, not decades. Three key areas must be addressed: set deadlines and enforce them, stop endless lawsuits and limit reviews to direct project impacts.

Pennsylvania doesn’t just have the energy resources America needs – it has the leadership to show how responsible energy development powers prosperity.

Everything is pointing to the fact that we need more energy, and that requires more infrastructure. Permitting reform is the key to opening the door to energy abundance and prosperity. Because when America builds, America wins.

New Data from MRD Study Reinforces IMNN-001's Promise as a Potential Breakthrough Immunotherapy

LAWRENCEVILLE, N.J., Dec. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- IMUNON , Inc. (Nasdaq: IMNN )

Dear Valued Shareholders,

2025, A Year of Momentum: Advancing Toward a Potential Breakthrough in Ovarian Cancer Treatment

As we close out 2025, I am excited to reflect on a year marked by significant clinical progress, robust data validation, and strategic execution that has significantly strengthened IMUNON's position. Our focus on harnessing the power to activate the body's immune system against cancer has yielded compelling results, bringing us closer to delivering innovative therapies that could transform patient outcomes and create substantial value for you, our shareholders. Very importantly, we believe that we are well positioned for an equally successful 2026.

One Step Closer to BLA Filing: Strong Progress in the Phase 3 OVATION 3 Study

This year, we initiated and advanced our pivotal Phase 3 OVATION 3 Study evaluating IMNN-001 in combination with standard-of-care neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy for women with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer. Enrollment continues to generate strong interest, underscoring the enthusiasm from investigators and the medical community for this potential sea change in the standard of care for this underserved population. This momentum is another metric illustrating the meaningful clinical outcomes observed in our Phase 2 OVATION 2 Study, where IMNN-001 demonstrated a 13-month extension in median overall survival (OS) in the intent-to-treat population (hazard ratio of 0.70). In patients receiving PARP inhibitors as maintenance therapy, the median OS in the IMNN-001 arm has not yet been reached, with all patients having surpassed 31 months of follow-up and numerous patients progressing beyond five years (vs. 37 months in the control arm; hazard ratio of 0.42). These results, presented at ASCO and published in Gynecologic Oncology, continue to highlight IMNN-001's potential to redefine frontline treatment, where no meaningful advances have occurred in over 30 years.

Renewing the Promise of Immunotherapy: New Insights from the Ongoing MRD Study

Building on this foundation, new data from our ongoing minimal residual disease (MRD) study—conducted in partnership with Break Through Cancer—further renew the promise of a novel immunotherapy for frontline ovarian cancer. Translational data demonstrate IMNN-001's broad impact on the tumor microenvironment, with definitive evidence that treatment leads to IL-12 production by macrophages in tumor tissue, boosting T cell cytotoxic functions. Specifically:

Macrophage activation: IMNN-001 induces robust expression of IL12A and IL12B in macrophages of peritoneal fluid and tumor tissue, stimulating a cascade of anti-tumor cytokines, including interferon-gamma, and resulting in potent macrophage and T cell activation.

Tumor microenvironment remodeling: The tumor immune microenvironment becomes more inflamed following exposure to IMNN-001, effectively turning ""cold"" tumors ""hot"" by activating both innate and adaptive immune systems.

Preliminary clinical readouts from the MRD study are equally encouraging, showing a lower MRD positivity rate, a lower percentage of tumor-containing biopsies in MRD-positive patients, higher complete response scores (CRS) at cytoreduction, and a higher probability of progression-free survival (PFS) with IMNN-001 compared to the control arm. The positive tolerability profile of IMNN-001 continues, including in combination with standard-of-care chemotherapy plus bevacizumab and also in the maintenance setting, with no cytokine release syndrome, systemic toxicities, or serious immune-related adverse events observed.

The consistency of evidence across our trials—OVATION 1, OVATION 2, MRD and now OVATION 3 —with IMNN-001's favorable benefit/risk profile, gives us strong hope for a potential breakthrough in treating newly diagnosed ovarian cancer, a disease affecting 20,000 women annually in the U.S. and 300,000 worldwide, with high recurrence and low five-year survival rates.

TheraPlas Platform: Expanding Horizons Beyond Ovarian Cancer

Our TheraPlas platform, which enables localized, durable expression of interleukin-12 (IL-12) and other therapeutic payloads, continues to validate its potential. By targeting the tumor site directly, our unique approach avoids the toxicities of systemic immunotherapies while remodeling the microenvironment to generate anti-tumor responses. We have an extensive set of completed animal experiments with IMNN-001 in additional tumor types and TheraPlas for other DNA plasmid delivered payloads, which could unlock growth opportunities through partnerships, including potential licensing in Asia-Pacific regions.

Financial Discipline and Outstanding Execution

Throughout 2025, we maintained financial discipline, conserving cash while securing resources to support our pivotal trial. Our cGMP-compliant manufacturing has reduced costs significantly, which may position us for high gross margins upon potential FDA approval. The resiliency in our share price, even amidst what we believe to be extreme short positions, and interest from institutional investors reflect growing confidence in our science and strategy. We remain committed to strategic funding of the OVATION 3 trial, estimated at $30 million for the HRD+ subgroup focus, with options for expansion.

Looking Ahead: A Pivotal 2026 and Beyond

As we enter 2026, IMUNON is poised for key milestones, including continued enrollment in OVATION 3 with interim analyses potentially enabling early stopping and BLA filing in the HRD+ population. We anticipate additional data presentations at major conferences, further translational insights from OVATION 2 tumor samples, and progress on business development initiatives. With Fast Track and Orphan Drug designations in place, we are dedicated to bringing IMNN-001 to patients in need while driving sustainable shareholder value.

On behalf of the IMUNON team, thank you for your unwavering support. Together, we are on the cusp of redefining cancer care.

Sincerely,

Stacy R. Lindborg, Ph.D.

ATHENS, Greece, Dec. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Capital Clean Energy Carriers Corp. (the “Company”, “CCEC”, “we” or “us”) (NASDAQ: CCEC), an international owner of ocean-going vessels, today announced it has ordered three latest technology LNG carriers (“LNG/C”) to be built at HD Hyundai Samho Co., Ltd (“Hyundai”) in South Korea, scheduled for delivery in 2028 and 2029.

CCEC has secured three LNG/C berths at Hyundai, with one vessel scheduled for delivery in the third quarter of 2028 and two further deliveries in the first quarter of 2029. The en-bloc ship building price of these vessels is $769.5 million. The vessels have been designed to incorporate a number of upgrades in their specification and are expected to rank amongst the most efficient LNG/Cs in the global fleet in terms of fuel consumption and boil-off rates.

With its latest order for three additional LNG/Cs, the Company reaffirms its strategic position as the largest US listed LNG shipping company with 12 LNG/Cs currently in the water and nine LNG/Cs on order (“Newbuild LNG/Cs”). The Company’s newbuilding deliveries span from the third quarter of 2026 to the first quarter of 2029, which coincides with the anticipated expansion of LNG liquefaction capacity from 493 mtpa today to at least 649 mtpa by 2030. In addition, CCEC has on order an additional 10 gas carriers, including four handy LCO 2 /multi-gas carriers and six dual-fuel medium gas carriers (the “Gas Fleet”), with deliveries starting in the first quarter of 2026. The CCEC fleet benefits from approximately $3.0 billion of contracted revenue and an average remaining charter duration of 6.9 years, underpinning the Company’s ongoing fleet expansion strategy. The Company’s strategy is to create shareholder value through creating scarcity value, while retaining commercial optionality via a disciplined mix of contracted and open vessel capacity. CCEC has delivered on this strategy by securing long term employment during 2025 for three of its newbuilding LNG/Cs, whilst simultaneously improving the financial strength of the company by recycling capital from its legacy container fleet.

As a result of the contracting of the three additional LNG/Cs, our capital expenditure schedule (“CAPEX”) has been revised as follows:

CAPEX Schedule of CCEC in USD million, as of December 29, 2025:

2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 TOTAL Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Newbuild LNG/C - 61.9 51.2 393.7 - 702.2 24.7 - 49.3 24.7 24.7 211.0 - 372.8 1,916.2 Gas Fleet 7.8 74.0 105.4 115.4 47.7 89.3 46.9 35.9 - - - - - - 522.4 TOTAL 7.8 135.9 156.6 509.1 47.7 791.5 71.6 35.9 49.3 24.7 24.7 211.0 - 372.8 2,438.6

The Company has paid by December 29, 2025, $386.1 million in advance to shipyards towards the acquisition of its under-construction fleet.

Jerry Kalogiratos, CEO of CCEC, commented: “ This is an opportunistic transaction for CCEC, which closely aligns with our executed strategy and forward objectives. I believe that we have secured attractive pricing and payment terms for state of the art, high specification vessels, whose deliveries we expect to coincide with increased demand for LNG shipping from a number of LNG projects that are expected to come online in this timeline. Notably, this transaction allows CCEC to selectively contract the most attractive specification LNG/Cs for charterers, to be delivered at the most undersupplied part of the forward curve.”

About Capital Clean Energy Carriers Corp.

Capital Clean Energy Carriers Corp. (NASDAQ: CCEC), an international shipping company, is one of the world’s leading platforms of gas carriage solutions with a focus on energy transition. CCEC’s in-the-water fleet includes 14 high specification vessels, including 12 latest generation LNG/Cs and two legacy Neo-Panamax container vessels, one of which has been agreed to be sold. In addition, CCEC’s under-construction fleet includes nine additional latest generation LNG/Cs, six dual-fuel medium gas carriers and four handy LCO 2 /multi-gas carriers, to be delivered between the first quarter of 2026 and the first quarter of 2029.

That’s why an increasing number of transportation leaders are turning to cleaner, more reliable energy sources, namely compressed natural gas (CNG) and electric vehicles (EVs).
At ABC Companies, this shift isn’t just theoretical – it’s happening on the ground.
Because the future of transportation isn’t just about getting from point A to point B; it’s about how smartly, sustainably, and securely you get there.
As Chief Operating Officer at ABC Companies, Jay Oakman oversees operational strategy, execution, and government affairs across ABC’s North American footprint.","Editor’s note: This op-ed for Bus & Motorcoach News is written by Jay Oakman, chief operating officer at ABC Companies.

In today’s unpredictable energy landscape, stability has become the ultimate competitive advantage. Global fuel markets remain in constant flux, influenced by geopolitical tensions, supply disruptions, and price volatility that can swing overnight. I have seen firsthand how these fluctuations can have an outsized impact on profitability and long-term planning for fleet operators.

That’s why an increasing number of transportation leaders are turning to cleaner, more reliable energy sources, namely compressed natural gas (CNG) and electric vehicles (EVs). As both technologies evolve and infrastructure expands, companies like ours are recognizing the strategic, economic, and environmental benefits of diversifying beyond traditional fossil fuels.

At ABC Companies, this shift isn’t just theoretical – it’s happening on the ground. Through new facilities, partnerships, and vehicle innovations, ABC is helping operators navigate a smarter, more sustainable future for fleet operations.

Trade policy clarity strengthens fleet stability

While tariffs and trade policy can influence long-term planning, the industry is benefiting from much-needed clarity. The administration’s recent proclamation formally recognizing motorcoaches as a distinct vehicle classification creates a more predictable environment for manufacturers and operators. It helps ensure the industry isn’t unintentionally swept into policies designed for heavy- and medium-duty trucks, and it reinforces motorcoaches’ unique role within the broader transportation ecosystem.

This recognition strengthens the foundation for future investment, innovation, and adoption of cleaner propulsion technologies without placing undue emphasis on tariffs.

CNG: A practical bridge to energy security

While EV adoption continues to accelerate, CNG remains one of the most practical alternatives available today. The U.S. benefits from a robust domestic natural gas supply, meaning fleets that convert to CNG reduce their dependence on imported oil and are less exposed to global price swings. Unlike gasoline or diesel, CNG prices are largely determined by domestic production and pipeline infrastructure, rather than global oil markets, making fuel cost projections more predictable.

We have found that CNG also delivers immediate benefits, typically reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 13-17% compared to equivalent diesel engines. With renewable natural gas entering the market, emissions reductions can become even more significant.

Our Denver facility is a direct response to this demand for reliable CNG servicing in the Mountain West, with full CNG servicing capabilities for both motorcoaches and transit vehicles.

EVs: The long game for sustainability and innovation

While electric vehicles remain an important part of the industry’s future, today’s infrastructure is still largely built for passenger EVs, not full-sized motorcoaches. That’s why many operators and even public transit agencies continue to rely on CNG for dependable, lower-emission performance.

ABC has explored EV capabilities firsthand. In 2021, the company conducted a Zero Emissions Tour, logging real-world miles to understand operational challenges and opportunities. The key takeaway: EV coaches can be effective in certain applications, but widespread adoption depends on significant expansion of heavy-duty charging infrastructure, which varies widely by market. States like California are moving faster, while others face slower grid and charging development.

For operators evaluating long-term electrification, ABC provides planning and technical support, but recognizes that, for most fleets today, CNG remains the most practical and scalable path forward.

A balanced path forward

For most fleets, the smartest approach isn’t about choosing between CNG and EV, it’s about finding the right blend for today’s needs and tomorrow’s goals. CNG offers an immediate, scalable solution that reduces fuel costs and environmental impact without overhauling operational infrastructure. EVs, on the other hand, set the foundation for long-term sustainability, future regulatory compliance, and leadership in clean transportation.

ABC Companies sits at the intersection of both. Its nationwide service network is equipped to maintain diesel, CNG, and EV systems, ensuring operators can transition at their own pace, supported by a partner that understands the realities of fleet performance, uptime, and economics.

Looking ahead

Energy independence isn’t just a national objective – it’s a business strategy. As tariffs, Section 232 trade distinctions, oil supply risks, and global energy transitions continue to reshape the market, operators who diversify their fleets now will be best positioned to weather uncertainty and capture opportunity.

With decades of experience and a clear commitment to innovation, ABC Companies is here to help operators act decisively with the right mix of technology, support, and insight to improve efficiency.

Because the future of transportation isn’t just about getting from point A to point B; it’s about how smartly, sustainably, and securely you get there.

Bottom Line For 2026 EV registration fees are expanding.","Electric cars keep getting cheaper to drive and easier to live with. Charging at home cuts fuel costs. Maintenance stays simple. Quiet cabins make daily commuting calmer. Yet a new type of bill has started appearing in mailboxes across the country. Annual EV registration surcharges, highway use fees, and road user charges are now part of ownership.

By mid-2025, 39 states had already adopted some form of special registration fee for EVs, with most charges landing between $50 and $290 per year.

More changes are scheduled for 2026. Some states are raising existing fees. Others are switching formulas. A growing group is preparing per-mile alternatives that work like a modern gas tax.

EV ownership is still expanding. State transportation budgets are still shrinking. Registration fees have become the preferred pressure valve between those two forces.

Key Points

39 states had EV registration surcharges in place by mid-2025, with annual fees commonly ranging from $50 to $290.

Many states are raising fees for 2026 and shifting toward indexed or weight-based pricing models.

Flat EV fees of $200 to $250 often exceed the federal gas tax paid by average gasoline drivers.

Per-mile road usage charges are expanding, with Oregon setting a 2.3 cents-per-mile rate for 2026.

Why States Keep Adding EV Fees

Gas taxes have funded roads for decades. Electric vehicles use those same roads yet do not buy gasoline. That design choice bypasses the fuel tax system entirely.

At the federal level, gasoline is taxed at 18.4 cents per gallon and diesel at 24.4 cents per gallon, as per the Federal Highway Administration.

That revenue supports the Highway Trust Fund, the backbone of federal transportation spending.

Two problems now collide:

EVs pay no gas tax.

Even gas vehicles generate less fuel tax than before because modern engines use less fuel per mile.

Construction costs keep rising. Fuel tax revenue keeps weakening. The Highway Trust Fund has struggled with structural shortfalls for years.

Projections show that under the current law, federal funds will fall short of obligations by FY2028.

States have chosen the fastest administrative fix. They add an annual EV fee at registration time. Because registration systems already store detailed vehicle records, tools like vingurus.com plate lookup can surface that information instantly.

Plate lookup services matter because they allow buyers, insurers, lenders, and investigators to verify a vehicle’s identity, title status, accident exposure, mileage pattern,s and possible theft or fraud risks without waiting on manual records requests.

They reduce information gaps in used-car transactions, support pricing accuracy, and lower the risk of hidden defects that lead to financial loss.

The Policy Logic States Use

Public explanations usually fall into three categories.

Replacing Missing Fuel Tax Revenue

State agencies state the logic directly. Electric vehicles use little or no gasoline. That means less contribution to the fuel tax system, which remains a primary funding source for road maintenance.

Registration fees attempt to replace part of that missing revenue.

Accounting For Vehicle Weight

Battery packs add mass. Many EVs weigh more than similar gasoline models. More weight leads to more road wear. Several states use that argument to justify tiered pricing tied to vehicle weight classes.

Using Existing Collection Systems

Per-mile tracking systems require mileage reporting, data processing, compliance checks, and enforcement. Registration fees require none of that. States already collect registration payments every year. EV surcharges simply attach to that cycle.

What “EV Registration Fee” Really Means

The phrase sounds simple. In practice, states apply EV charges in several forms:

Flat annual surcharges added to standard registration

Tiered fees based on vehicle weight or powertrain type

Indexed fees that rise automatically over time

Per-mile road usage charges that may be voluntary or mandatory

For 2026, the major trend is movement away from flat pricing and toward weight-based or indexed formulas.

Pennsylvania

Pennsylvania wrote its EV fee increases directly into law.

2025 EV fee: $200

2026 EV fee: $250

Plug-in hybrid fee in 2026: $62.50

Indexing after 2026: CPI-based annual adjustments begin in 2027

NCSL information shows that the law applies the $250 rate to registrations or renewals submitted in 2026. Starting in July 2026, PennDOT will also allow monthly payment plans for EV and plug-in hybrid owners.

Practical impact:

Pennsylvania shows the future direction clearly. Fees are not static. They rise. They index. Payment systems adjust to normalize the cost as part of routine ownership.

Minnesota

Minnesota raised its EV surcharge effective August 1, 2025. CBS News reported the following:

Previous EV surcharge: $75

New EV surcharge: $150 minimum

New plug-in hybrid surcharge: $75

Indexing mechanism: tied to gasoline excise tax indexing adjustments

Owners renewing registrations in 2026 will feel the change directly. The structure also positions Minnesota fees to rise automatically over time.

Delaware

Delaware begins collecting Alternative Fuel Vehicle fees on October 1, 2025. That makes 2026 the first full year most owners experience the new charges.

Key context from Delaware’s own data:

57,500 alternative fuel vehicles were registered when the fee program was announced.

Delaware confirmed that 39 other states already had similar fees in place.

Delaware uses tiered, weight-based pricing. For example:

Plug-in electric vehicles 6,000 pounds or less face an $85 annual fee.

Heavier vehicles pay higher fees based on weight brackets.

Delaware signals where many legislatures are headed. Flat fees are being replaced by schedules that tie price to vehicle mass and class.

A Practical Snapshot Of EV Fees Going Into 2026

The following table shows well-documented examples with active change dynamics entering 2026. Amounts reflect special EV charges only.

Where Per-Mile Charges Fit

Vehicle miles traveled systems aim to charge drivers based on distance driven rather than flat annual fees. The concept tracks road use more precisely, yet the administration burden is heavier.

Estimated administrative and enforcement costs for VMT systems fall in the 5% to 13% range of total collection. Gas taxes cost far less to administer because they are collected upstream from fuel suppliers.

Oregon’s Role

Oregon remains central to the national conversation.

Starting in 2026, OReGO members pay 2.3 cents per mile.

Policy discussions in Oregon have included flat fees around $340 or per-mile charges near 3 cents per mile as budget solutions.

Utah and Virginia also offer voluntary road usage charge programs.

Even when optional, per-mile programs shape long-term fee design and normalize mileage tracking systems.

How EV Fees Compare To Gas Taxes

Drivers often ask if EV registration fees exceed what gasoline drivers pay.

A quick federal-only comparison shows why the debate exists. According to AP News:

Average annual miles per driver: 13,476

Gas vehicle efficiency: 30 mpg

Annual gallons: 13,476 / 30 ≈ 449 gallons

Federal gas tax: 449 × $0.184 ≈ $82.62

A flat $200 to $250 EV fee exceeds that federal gas tax alone. States counter that total fuel taxes include state and local levies and that heavier vehicles cause more road wear.

EVs and plug-in hybrids still represented only 1.7% of the total U.S. vehicle fleet in 2023, which limits how much revenue EV-only fees can raise in the near term.

Transportation funding gaps remain far larger. Projections show an average $41 billion annual Highway Trust Fund deficit for FY2026 to FY2035.

What “More States Are Planning To Add Charges” Means For 2026

The next phase is not about introducing EV fees from scratch. The next phase focuses on refinement.

Fee Schedules Become More Technical

Weight-based tiers, vehicle class categories, and powertrain distinctions are becoming standard legislative language. Delaware already models that approach.

Indexing Becomes The Default

Pennsylvania and Minnesota now rely on automatic adjustment mechanisms. Indexing reduces repeated legislative battles and steadily increases long-term costs to owners.

Payment Systems Are Being Normalized

Monthly payment options and streamlined collection systems make EV fees feel routine rather than exceptional. Pennsylvania’s 2026 monthly payment rollout illustrates that shift.

Per-Mile Charges Move Closer To Mandates

Oregon and Hawaii discussions show that per-mile models are no longer theoretical. They now tie directly into state budget planning.

How To Estimate Your 2026 EV Fee In Minutes

Use a short checklist.

Identify vehicle category: Battery electric, plug-in hybrid, or hybrid. Many states price them differently.

Confirm registration cycle: Annual or biennial terms change how fees are calculated.

Check vehicle weight: Weight-based tiers can raise or lower costs significantly.

Review scheduled increases: Look for increases that activate in 2026.

Check for per-mile options: Some programs allow mileage charges instead of flat fees.

The Debates That Will Shape Future Laws

Fair Share Versus Overcharge

Supporters argue EV drivers should contribute to road funding. Critics point out that flat fees can exceed fuel taxes paid by many gasoline drivers.

Flat Fees Versus Mileage Tracking

Flat fees are easy to administer. Mileage systems align cost with use yet raise privacy, enforcement, and administrative cost concerns.

State Fees Versus Federal Action

A 2025 federal proposal suggested national registration fees of $250 for EVs and $100 for hybrids, administered by states. The proposal did not pass.

Federal involvement would immediately change double-payment questions across states.

Bottom Line For 2026

EV registration fees are expanding. Scheduled increases, indexed formulas, weight-based tiers, and per-mile pilots define the next stage of policy.

Use your state’s DMV publications and statutory trackers to verify current amounts. Fees can change mid-year and can apply differently by registration cycle, vehicle class, and weight category.

For many owners, 2026 will feel less like a new rule and more like a normalization of annual EV charges as part of routine vehicle ownership.",https://freedomforallamericans.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Electric-vehicle-taxes-by-state.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 11:00:45.529782

“People in small towns and rural areas pay much bigger energy bills.
Together, the coalition set the goal of slashing energy bills for more than 17,000 families in the region through solar projects capable of generating over 100 megawatts of electrical power.
Should the Trump administration refuse to release the Solar for All money promised to Groundswell, Moore says her organization will explore other options to get the solar projects off the ground.
“People are struggling with high (energy) bills that are getting higher.","Clemetine Howard has spent the past year dreaming of bringing affordable solar energy to the Mississippi Delta.

Howard is executive director of the Clarence and Mary Lee Howard Foundation in Yazoo City, Mississippi—one of many locations previously set to benefit from a $7 billion federal program aimed at making solar power accessible to low-income households. The “Solar for All” program promised to lower energy bills and create jobs in places like the Delta, and Howard’s foundation had spent months setting up training and development courses to help local residents join the solar workforce.

Those efforts were suspended in August when the Environmental Protection Agency canceled the program, halting billions of dollars in solar funding bound for communities across the country. The termination is part of the Trump administration’s broader campaign to claw back clean energy investments and climate spending authorized under the previous administration.

Losing the Solar for All program was a gut punch for Howard, who saw it as a catalyst for improving conditions in Yazoo City and changing the career trajectory of some of its residents.

“It was truly devastating,” Howard told the Mississippi Free Press on Sept. 24. “We saw this as a way to make a life-changing difference to folks in the Mississippi Delta.”

The Solar for All program is part of the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund established under former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. Launched in 2023, the program awarded grants to 60 applicants working to expand access to solar power—a renewable energy increasingly seen as a cleaner, more cost-effective alternative to fossil fuels. Grant recipients ranged from state and municipal governments to tribes and nonprofits, and projects included solar panel leasing programs for homeowners and community solar initiatives for renters and multifamily properties.

The federal funds were meant to offset the initial cost of installing solar panel systems and related community projects, which typically carry price tags of tens of thousands of dollars. In 2025, a homeowner can expect to pay around $14,210 for a small residential solar panel system before factoring in financial incentives, one Consumer Affairs report found.

When fully executed, Solar for All was poised to deliver solar power to 900,000 households nationwide, many of them in rural and underserved areas, according to estimates from the Biden administration. Those homes were expected to save a collective $350 million in utility costs annually, with some families pocketing more than $1,000 each year.

“With the way this program was structured, the savings were massive,” said Emily Samsel, a spokesperson at Climate Power, a strategic communications organization focused on climate change. “President Trump said in his (2024) campaign that he would cut energy bills in half by the end of his first year in office, and we’ve already seen bills are up 10% nationwide. He’s actively raising energy costs by taking away programs like Solar for All.”

In a statement to the Mississippi Free Press, the EPA said it lacks the authority and funds to administer Solar for All following the passage of President Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” in July. The legislation revoked the appropriated money in Biden’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund—a move that many groups and lawmakers have blasted as illegal.

“​​The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law on July 4, 2025, rescinds both the authority and the appropriated funds to run the Solar for All program. EPA is working diligently to implement the law in accordance with congressional intent,” EPA Press Secretary Brigit Hirsch wrote in a Sept. 29 email.

Solar for All’s dissolution has drawn multiple legal challenges. On Oct. 16, more than a dozen state attorneys general sued the EPA over the canceled solar funds, asking a federal judge to direct the agency to reinstate the program. The lawsuit follows earlier litigation from a collection of labor groups and other nonprofits seeking to reverse the program’s termination.

Lawsuits challenging the elimination of separate Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund investments are still ongoing, though an appeals court ruled last month that federal officials can move forward with the cancellations.

Fighting for Energy Affordability

Among the 60 Solar for All grantees set to receive funding before the August termination was Groundswell, an organization dedicated to increasing energy resilience and efficiency across multiple regions. The nonprofit secured a five-year, $156 million contract from the EPA to build community solar projects across eight southern states, with more than $8 million earmarked for Mississippi ventures.

Though much of the discourse around Solar for All has centered on clean energy investments, Groundswell CEO Michelle Moore stressed that the program’s core objective was affordability.

“The primary goal of the program, and actually the statutory goal of the program, was to cut electricity bills,” she told the Mississippi Free Press in a Sept. 24 interview. “People in small towns and rural areas pay much bigger energy bills. It’s not because the electricity is any more expensive—it’s just that the housing is in such bad shape.”

To execute its contract with EPA, Groundswell has spent the past two years building a coalition of municipal utility providers and community organizations throughout the Southeast, including Clemetine Howard’s charitable foundation in Yazoo City. Together, the coalition set the goal of slashing energy bills for more than 17,000 families in the region through solar projects capable of generating over 100 megawatts of electrical power.

The same week that the EPA announced the termination of Solar for All, Groundswell received a bid for a solar and energy storage project in Yazoo City that would have helped 185 families save $1,170 annually on electricity, according to company estimates. The initiative was the first of several planned projects in Mississippi, which Groundswell projected would benefit over 1,200 households and deliver aggregate cost savings of nearly $30 million over 20 years.

The projects would also create solar and utility jobs that Moore and Howard stressed could help lift some residents out of poverty.

“You’re talking about individuals who would go from living in small quarters … to owning a home and building wealth,” Howard explained, noting that many solar installation jobs have annual salaries of around $60,000. “So you’re talking about economic development in a real sense.”

Charting A Path Forward

Moore isn’t willing to give up the Solar for All funding awarded to Groundswell without a fight. In late August, her organization filed a formal Notice of Disagreement with the EPA over the grant’s cancellation—the first step in an administrative dispute process that Moore hopes could spark renewed negotiations with the agency. This dispute process is separate from litigation challenging the EPA’s decision to withhold funds appropriated by Congress, Moore added.

“The ball is in EPA’s court,” she said, noting that she expects a response to her filing no later than February. “We would still welcome the opportunity to sit down with EPA officials (to talk) about a path forward, as well as continuing to pursue the administrative process.”

Groundswell is not the only Solar for All grantee with planned projects in Mississippi. The EPA also selected Hope Enterprise Corporation, a Jackson-based credit union and financial services institution, to receive more than $62 million in federal funds for a rooftop solar leasing program and various community solar initiatives, according to the company website.

The Mississippi Free Press reached out to Hope Enterprise Corporation several times to inquire about the grant and its cancellation, but did not hear back by press time.

Should the Trump administration refuse to release the Solar for All money promised to Groundswell, Moore says her organization will explore other options to get the solar projects off the ground.

“People are struggling with high (energy) bills that are getting higher. And not only that, our region is short on power,” she said. “So whether the federal government stands behind its contract or not, the facts don’t change, and neither does our commitment.”

Environmental protection was a bipartisan effort in the 1970s: The EPA was created by President Nixon, a Republican.
The Clean Air Act of 1970 was the first law to require the EPA to set uniform nationwide standards for air quality.
I could go on with photos and stories about laws from the 1970s that changed how Americans treat our lands and waters.","Growing up in the 1970s, I took for granted the trash piles along the highway, tires washed up on beaches and smog fouling city air.

Such scenes are why the first Earth Day — on April 22, 1970 — energized the nation. In the largest single-day public demonstration in U.S. history, roughly 10% of the population took to the streets to shout together: “Enough is enough!”

Republican and Democratic politicians alike listened. Over the decade that followed, all the nation’s foundational environmental laws were passed with strong bipartisan support, including the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act and Endangered Species Act.

These laws are taking a beating at the moment, including from the Environmental Protection Agency — the federal agency created in 1970 to protect the environment. The agency’s leader, Lee Zeldin, boasted of “driving a dagger straight into the heart” of environmental regulations. President Trump regularly derides environmental laws as job killers and government overreach.

The conditions that made these laws necessary have largely been forgotten, allowing critics to focus entirely on costs while ignoring the laws’ very real benefits and achievements.

That’s why I was excited to learn recently about the Documerica project: 20,000 photos taken from 1972 through 1978 that show in clear visual evidence how dirty the U.S. used to be. Looking back at it now should wake people up to how much better the environment is today.

Environmental protection was a bipartisan effort in the 1970s: The EPA was created by President Nixon, a Republican. The agency’s first leader was William Ruckelshaus, a Republican congressman from Indiana.

Inspired by the famous photographs of Depression-era farmworkers commissioned in the 1930s by the Farm Security Administration, Ruckelshaus’ EPA commissioned a nationwide photo record. The goal was to create a “visual baseline” that would demonstrate the agency’s future progress.

To say America’s landscape was littered in the 1970s is not merely poetic phrasing. Waste disposal was a matter of local law, and illegal dumping was commonplace. Drums of pesticides and chemicals could be sent to the local dump along with tires and just about anything else people and companies wanted to get rid of. When the dump was full, it was covered with topsoil and became open land, ready for recreation or building construction.

One place where this happened was Love Canal, a neighborhood near Niagara Falls, N.Y. A dump holding decades of chemical drums from the Hooker Chemical Co. was lightly covered and sold to the town for $1. A neighborhood was built on the land.

Only when people noticed high levels of miscarriages and cancer clusters among the residents — and saw waste oozing in through basement walls — did opinion change.

In 1976, Congress passed the Resource Conservation Recovery Act to track waste materials from their creation to their disposal and set tough standards for how to dispose of them. But by then, decades of unregulated waste disposal had contaminated sites all over the country. The contaminants, toxicity and people responsible were often unknown.

Four years later, the 1980 law known as “Superfund” set standards and assigned financial responsibility for cleaning up hazardous waste sites. The law created a multibillion-dollar fund that could pay for the cleanups and required potentially responsible parties to reimburse the government or clean up the sites on their own.

Suddenly, companies paid much more careful attention to their waste disposal.

Just as with dumps on land, all kinds of waste used to be disposed of in rivers, lakes and harbors. There was a federal law in place, but it was ineffective and relied on states to set limits and enforce them.

I had the misfortune in 1978 to capsize while sailing on the Charles River in Boston. My shame turned to a dermatologist’s visit when I broke out in rashes the next day. You fell in the Charles at your peril.

Environmental advocates weren’t kidding when, in the 1960s and 1970s, they declared “Lake Erie is a dead lake” because of all the industrial pollution pouring into its waters. An oil slick on Cleveland’s Cuyahoga River famously caught fire in 1969 — actually the 12th time the river had burned in a century.

The Clean Water Act of 1972 sought to create a national standard, requiring companies that wanted to discharge waste into waterways to get a federal permit and use the best available technology to reduce the amount and toxicity of what they did dump. The act also provided billions of taxpayer dollars to upgrade sewage treatment plants, so they didn’t just dump untreated sewage into the water.

The ambitious goal was to end water pollution entirely and make all of the nation’s waters safe for swimming and fishing within a decade. Those aspirational goals for the country’s waters still have not been fully met, though Ruckelshaus used to quip that at least they are not flammable. And by now, the Charles River and other urban waterways that people avoided in the 1970s boast all manner of recreation, with little or no risk of rashes even while swimming.

Perhaps the most obvious improvement since the 1970s has been in air quality around the U.S.

The horrible smog around Los Angeles is well known. But many other cities were blanketed in polluted air that led to respiratory illnesses and millions of early deaths across the nation over the decades. In Pittsburgh it was only half-jokingly said that you had to floss your teeth after breathing.

The Clean Air Act of 1970 was the first law to require the EPA to set uniform nationwide standards for air quality. In short order, lead was phased out of gasoline, catalytic converters were required on cars, acid rain was ended and the sources of smog were stringently regulated. An EPA study found that the benefits under the law exceeded costs by a factor of more than 30 to 1 and, in 2020 alone, prevented more than 230,000 early deaths.

I could go on with photos and stories about laws from the 1970s that changed how Americans treat our lands and waters. But it all boils down to two simple facts. First, with the exception of greenhouse gases, which have been in effect unregulated, every major measure of environmental health has improved significantly over the last five decades. And second, those improvements all occurred during times of strong economic growth, with inflation-adjusted gross domestic product increasing fivefold.

Calling these laws “job killers” misses the point entirely. They created jobs and stopped environmental killers. Regulations have their costs, to be sure, but the Documerica photographs show just how far the nation has come, and what is at risk if we forget.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8bde3be/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1183x621+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F54%2Fad%2F674cce504f4f8bf1210becbf60a8%2Flake.png,N,,2025-12-29 10:01:10.274726

Now, city officials are looking to evolve their city’s business footprint toward greener power. They’re not alone.

Opened in 1902, the refinery has led some to make concerted efforts to distance the city of more than 100,000 people from the fossil fuel industry, most recently through a short-lived ballot measure supported by activists who said funds would be needed to help envision a Richmond without a refinery.

A $550 million settlement between Richmond and the refinery, paid over a 10-year period, resulted in the measure being pulled from the November 2024 ballot.

Aside from charging one of the city’s largest taxpayers, some have also looked toward attracting clean energy businesses. The off-shore wind industry has risen as a potential option, with the city being awarded a $750,000 grant from the California Energy Commission in December to help with drafting an Offshore Wind Conceptual Planning Project.

“This planning effort represents a critical first step toward positioning the Port of Richmond as a potential host for future offshore-wind activities — an industry expected to generate thousands of high-quality jobs and substantial economic benefits,” read a staff report detailing the project.

Like Richmond, ports in Humboldt, Oakland, Benicia, Stockton, San Francisco and Redwood City, as well as private terminals in Antioch and Pittsburg, have also been identified in a study by the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management as potential offshore wind manufacturing and fabrication sites.

Companies like Viridi Parente, a bicoastal battery energy storage system manufacturer that opened in Richmond this past summer, have also been welcomed with open arms. With the support of a $9.3 million California Energy Commission grant, Viridi operates out of a 40,000-square-foot facility formerly home to its competitor Moxion Power, which laid off hundreds of employees and filed for bankruptcy in 2024.

Viridi offers battery energy storage system products that can either be installed in existing occupied facilities like industrial, medical, commercial, or municipal buildings, or trailered into temporary worksites or events.

Motivated by concerns for rising energy costs, stressed power grids and climate change, dozens of elected officials from across the country gathered in early December to tour the Richmond facility and learn more about what the technology can do.

“This is where the rubber meets the road. We’re the ones that have to manifest it,” said San Rafael Mayor Kate Colin, speaking to the pressure on city officials to implement state legislation, including renewable energy policies.

The road toward greener pastures is still unclear for Richmond and the greater region.

Viridi officials say the company plans to continue its expansion in Richmond, which will mean increasing staffing to meet growing demand for products.

Glydways, a company building small, electric, autonomous public transportation vehicles, is transforming an underutilized parking lot in Richmond into a testing ground. And renewable fuel company Raven SR plans to develop a plant in the city where organic waste will be converted into hydrogen fuel.

At the city government level, Colin and Esther Morales, director of innovation in Oakland Mayor Barbara Lee’s office, both said their respective cities are trying to understand how they can pursue renewable energy solutions while responsibly managing their budgets.

Meanwhile, the battle over state and federal government supported renewable energy projects continues with California officials and agencies supporting offshore wind initiatives while the Trump administration has taken steps to block wind energy projects through executive order and canceled grants worth $679 million, according to multiple news reports. Notably, those measures have been met by resistance and lost court battles.

For Richmond Mayor Eduardo Martinez, a world in which green businesses replace oil refineries is one to pursue. Martinez was a keynote speaker at the Dec. 3 Viridi event alongside Hawaii State Sen. Chris Lee and Viridi CEO Jon Williams.

“Chevron has shaped our economy and our neighborhoods for generations,” Martinez said. “Richmond is looking towards the future, where our economy is not dependent on a single fossil fuel employer. We are growing sectors that create cleaner hair, good jobs, and long term stability.”",https://www.siliconvalley.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/EBT-L-BESS-XX-5.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-12-29 10:00:41.530888

They’re preparing to push hard for bills that will advance solar energy and batteries amid Trump administration attacks that will end key subsidies for renewables in 2026.
“Climate is going to make a comeback this year in Maryland,” said Brittany Baker, Maryland director at the Chesapeake Climate Action Network.
“We have options that include renewables and natural gas,” Ferguson said.
“The way I feel, I think natural gas ought to be a part of this.” It’s clear, said Del.","In many ways, Maryland climate advocates felt “blindsided” by the 2025 legislative session, says Kim Coble, leader of the state chapter of the League of Conservation Voters.

Spurred by calls and emails from constituents complaining of high power bills, legislative leaders determined that increasing in-state energy generation was the solution, passing proposals to bolster solar panels and battery storage technology. But they also opened the door for expedited permitting of a new natural gas-fired power plant in Maryland — even though it would likely place the state’s ambitious climate commitments out of reach.

And in October — in response to the legislature’s new energy law — Constellation Energy proposed just that.

“When we would say: ‘How does this match with our climate goals?’” Coble said, “the response you’d get back is: ‘We have to generate more energy.’”

With the 2026 session approaching, climate groups say they are ready for round two. They’re preparing to push hard for bills that will advance solar energy and batteries amid Trump administration attacks that will end key subsidies for renewables in 2026.

And they’re better prepared to play defense, opposing new natural gas generation, and any efforts to mine environmental and energy funds to close another intimidating budget shortfall.

“Climate is going to make a comeback this year in Maryland,” said Brittany Baker, Maryland director at the Chesapeake Climate Action Network.

Climate promises a ‘heavy lift’

Judge denies US Wind request to halt Trump administration attacks

But at least one leading lawmaker, Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) said during a December interview that new natural gas remains on the table.

“We have options that include renewables and natural gas,” Ferguson said. “I think we have to have a really challenging conversation this session about the balance between the aggressiveness of our climate policies and the affordability for everyday Marylanders — and there’s a balance in between.”

Current law requires the state, in just five years, to have reduced its greenhouse gas emissions 60% from 2006 levels. And nine years from now, Gov. Wes Moore (D) has pledged that the state will use 100% clean energy.

State studies have shown that the two goals are going to be a challenge. A January 2025 report from the Maryland Energy Administration labeled Moore’s clean energy goal “incredibly difficult.” One potential roadmap included a massive 185% increase in nuclear power, along with big increases in solar, onshore and offshore wind.

Paul Pinsky, recently retired director of the Energy Administration, and the architect of the state’s climate mandates, said that both goals will be “a heavy lift.”

“There’s been some retreat, and that’s a problem,” Pinsky said. “We’ve got five years, and we have a fairly significant way to go. So I’m not sure: Are we going to put our shoulders on the grindstone and push forward, or will the government backtrack?”

Part of the problem, Pinsky said, is that no legislators back then expected power demand to rise so precipitously — largely because no one predicted the role of data centers and artificial intelligence.

“We didn’t think or talk about data centers,” said Pinsky, who represented Prince George’s County in the General Assembly for decades before taking over the Energy Administration. “It was not on our radar screen.”

If Pinsky knew then what he knows now, the Climate Solutions Now Act might have looked a bit different, he said.

“I would have said that any data center coming into the state has to bring additional energy, at a minimum — and maybe requiring clean energy,” Pinsky said.

Preventing a solar energy ‘valley of death’

Climate advocates plan to take advantage of the moment to promote renewables in Maryland, especially solar and storage, as Maryland’s offshore wind projects face an unabating assault from the White House.

“Our message to the General Assembly is: You wanted to see what all of the proposals would look like. Now you’re looking at them,” said Josh Tulkin, executive director of the Maryland chapter of the Sierra Club. “And we think that there’s a strong case that the clean energy and energy efficiency and battery storage options are providing the opportunities that Maryland needs.”

Perhaps aiding advocates’ argument is the fact that Constellation CEO Joe Dominguez has admitted the company’s proposal for a new gas plant in Harford County would be expensive — and likely require state assistance. Getting gas to the site could cost north of $800 million, he told a gathering of legislators in November. The company also offered a battery storage proposal for the expedited consideration before the Public Service Commission.

“We need to kind of make some decisions. We could be a state that has its own natural gas-fired generation, or we can continue to be a state that builds transmission lines in from Pennsylvania,” Dominguez said in November. “The way I feel, I think natural gas ought to be a part of this.”

It’s clear, said Del. Lorig Charkoudian (D-Montgomery), that gas couldn’t be built in Maryland “without some kind of state support.” But that money is better spent elsewhere, she said.

“Let’s figure out what additional supports are needed, and let’s use that to double down on renewables that are also good for our air, our land, our water and our climate,” she said.

Constellation targets Harford County for new gas plant, but pipeline costs could get in the way

Charkoudian said she is working on a bill that would direct funds that Maryland already collects from energy suppliers (and, by extension, ratepayers) and direct it to the winning bidders in a competitive procurement for new solar energy projects.

Currently, those funds — a specific type of “alternative compliance payments” — go into the Strategic Energy Investment Fund, which energy suppliers pay into when they do not meet the state’s renewable energy requirements. There, the funds can be deployed for a variety of uses, including solar projects but also energy efficiency upgrades for low-income households, EV chargers and more.

“Now, we’re taking that money and building solar with it,” Charkoudian said.

Evan Vaughan, executive director of MAREC Action, formerly the Mid-Atlantic Renewable Energy Coalition, said his members, which include solar developers and panel manufacturers, support the delegate’s proposal.

“These projects can come online faster than just about anything else,” he said. “But this is partially to prevent there from being a valley of death for the solar industry with the federal tax incentives going away.”

Del. David Fraser-Hidalgo (D-Montgomery) said he is focusing on minimizing “soft costs” for solar developers, particularly given that federal tax credits are set to lapse next summer, after President Donald Trump (R) signed the “One Big Beautiful Bill” into law.

“Every project just went up 30%, with the loss of that federal tax credit, which is concerning,” Fraser-Hidalgo said. “We don’t want to lose the solar industry in Maryland.”",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-101/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/iil-bw-xx-cb-ian-aj-0013_0-1-1024x6321767014703.jpg?h=3f82fd9e&itok=ZrFbNWpt,N,,2025-12-29 10:13:49.825930

“EPA released their volumes for 2026 and 2027 this year. So, ACE and others have been participating in that rulemaking process, and one of the things is that there’s a Small Refinery Exemption Program with the RFS, and the EPA this year proposed to reallocate gallons that they’ve been waiving for the small refinery exemption. So, we need those gallons reallocated, so demand destruction doesn’t happen, and we keep those renewable volumes whole. And so, we’re still waiting for the EPA here to finalize that rulemaking and give our farmers and biofuel producers some clarity here, and then they need to reallocate those gallons and follow through on what they propose by 100 percent reallocation.”

Katie Muckenhirn, vice president of public affairs for the American Coalition for Ethanol, says requiring fuel processors to blend in biofuels has always been a point of contention.

“That’s been a struggle throughout the years, and what the EPA has said, and what we know to be true, is that refineries can recover the costs of biofuel through the RINs. And so, yeah, there’s a cost to comply, but then they recover those costs through a RIN value, so the struggle is the play over market share.”

ACE is also pushing Congress to pass the Nationwide Consumer and Fuel Retailer Choice Act to secure year-round E15 access across all states, which is vital for utilizing the nation’s record corn crop.

“Absolutely, those eight Midwest states do have E15 year-round, but we need it nationwide, and there is bipartisan, bicameral legislation in Congress, the Nationwide Consumer and Fuel Retailer Choice Act, led by Nebraska Senator Deb Fisher. And we need that legislation to be passed to ensure that all states can sell E15 nationwide without waiting on those summer waivers that we’ve had to do for the last four summers. So, you know, the time is ripe for that, even more than ever now, with farmers having a record corn crop coming in. We need outlets. We need markets.”

Persistence and ingenuity over the decades across the world made the potential realization of solar energy a reality.","In 1839, a magical phenomenon was observed. ‘The Photovoltaic effect’ was discovered by a French physicist, Alexandre Edmond Becquerel. Being the first instance of light being converted to energy, it opened the doors to the field of solar power. Becquerel’s fascinating discovery has undergone a profound evolution from the singular curiosity of a scientist to the principle of an advanced solar industry. In 2025, the evolution of the industry has undergone a crazy transformation- to a singular millimeter.

Sphelar cells are pioneers in the world of solar technology and may reach mainstream tech status soon

Sphelar Power, a pioneer of solar technology, has, for the first time, designed spherical solar cells with a diameter of one millimeter. These, the Sphelar cells, are a game changer in the world of solar technology.

Unlike the conventional solar panel, which has a flat and rigid design, Sphelar cells are able to capture solar energy from any direction. As a result, they are able to provide energy from sun rays at any position in the solar cycle, which is something conventional solar panels are unable to dream of.

How do Sphelar cells work?

Why are Sphelar cells low-maintenance? They’re happy in shaded areas, urban landscapes, or even areas where sunlight is weak or indirect.

Their compact size opens new possibilities for integration into everyday objects.

Portable solar cells can be used to power windows, building facades, wearables, electric vehicles, and even solar-powered batteries.

Becquerel’s discovery: A testament to the evolution of solar technology

Becquerel’s discovery and Sphelar’s solar tech innovations are a true testament to how far solar technologies have come. At first, photovoltaic cells were costly, electrically inefficient, and capable of generating only a small fraction of a watt of power.

It was only after many years that advancements in the composition of semiconductors and the efficiencies in their construction resulted in the manufacture of solar cells and panels at the lowest prices in the market, yielding a highly efficient renewable energy source.

The renewable energy market would see solar power as one of the most rapidly advancing energy generation technologies and as one of the fastest growing of any energy source.

Even with the improvements, there would still be the inability to capture light energy in non-ideal conditions, aesthetic and spatial limitations, and poor versatility of designs.

Do you believe that one unique downsizing idea could change contemporary living?

Solar Power focused on innovative solar energized solutions and mitigating challenges. In this vein, the design of the cells was downscaled to millimeters in size. They were also integrated sedimentarily in microspherical structured eco cell clusters. These offer a seamless integumentary energy collection design, which is advantageous in that it’s suitable for all surfaces in contemporary living.

Microcells have the versatility to be mounted in clusters where large power generation is needed or scattered for borderless decentralized energy capture. Microorganisms have great adaptability, making them able to serve new, harsher environments, expanding the use of solar energy to new and borderless environments.

Sustainability and innovation

Sustainability goes hand in hand with innovation and advancement in technology. Sphelar cells assist in mobile solar energy harvesting in metropolitan areas. The technology assists in the harvesting of solar energy in congested urban areas. The cells also preserve the environmental footprint and allow conversion of solar energy with the deployed technology.

Persistence and ingenuity over the decades across the world made the potential realization of solar energy a reality. With the potential large-scale commercialization of Sphelar cells, we are now at a juncture of a new era in transforming technology and the solar energy system. The ability of the technology to economically decentralize mobile solar technology deployed in urban areas and to economically democratize renewable energy to consumers in the form of portable modern solar cells is revolutionary.",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/unnamed-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 08:58:08.118297

This includes 96 per cent of liberal Democrats, 86 per cent of moderate/conservative Democrats, 57 per cent of liberal/moderate Republicans, and 26 per cent of conservative Republicans.
However, the poll found that 77 per cent of registered voters support US participation in the Paris Climate Agreement, with 64 per cent opposing Trump’s decision to pull out of the commitment.
*The poll consists of 47 per cent Democrats, 42 per cent Republicans, 9 per cent Independents, and 3 per cent of registered voters who didn’t select any political party but are still registered to vote.","Most registered voters in the US lean favourably towards green energy investment and climate commitments, despite Donald Trump’s blistering attacks.

The POTUS has consistently worked to boost polluting fuels that fry the planet, describing wind and solar power as “the scam of the century” and vowing not to approve any new projects.

He previously argued the concept of global warming was “created by and for the Chinese” to make US manufacturing non-competitive, and referred to wind energy as a “con job” during his trip to Scotland - urging Europe to “stop the windmills”.

Earlier this month, theUS Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also removed all mention of fossil fuels – the main driver of global warming – from its popular online page explaining the causes of climate change. Now it only mentions natural phenomena, even though scientists calculate that the majority of the warming is due to human activity.

Despite the series of rollbacks, a new poll by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication shows that the climate crisis is still a key consideration for US voters.

Where do US voters stand on global warming?

The nationally representative survey, which consists of 990 registered voters, found that 59 per cent would prefer to vote for a candidate for public office who supports action on global warming.

This was spearheaded by liberal Democrats (95 per cent) and a large majority of moderate/conservative Democrats (82 per cent). However, 42 per cent of liberal/moderate Republicans also said they would prefer a candidate supporting climate action - as well as 21 per cent of conservative Republicans.

41 per cent of surveyed voters said they would like to hear from political candidates about efforts to reduce global warming more often, while 35 per cent said global warming will be a “very important” issue to them in deciding who they will vote for in the 2026 congressional election.

Most US voters support green energy

More than 60 per cent of registered voters also think developing sources of clean energy should be a “high or very high priority” for the President and Congress.

In fact, the majority of participants supported a range of policies to reduce carbon pollution, such as restoring soil healthand bolstering green energy.

Even Republicans supported funding more research into renewable energy sources – with 73 per cent of liberal-moderate Republicans and 47 per cent of conservative Republicans backing the drive.

Despite Trump often criticising the appearance of solar and wind farms, 66 per cent of registered voters support transitioning the US economy from fossil fuels to 100 per cent clean energy by 2050.

This includes 96 per cent of liberal Democrats, 86 per cent of moderate/conservative Democrats, 57 per cent of liberal/moderate Republicans, and 26 per cent of conservative Republicans.

Should Donald Trump have left the Paris Agreement?

In 2015, almost 200 nations, including the US, signed a legally-binding treaty to hold the “increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above preindustrial levels” and pursue efforts to “limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above preindustrial levels”.

Dubbed The Paris Agreement, the treaty is often seen as one of the biggest environmental commitments in history. However, just two years later, Trump initiated the process to withdraw from the treaty.

For the first time in 30 years, the US had no official representation at this year’s UN COP talks.

However, the poll found that 77 per cent of registered voters support US participation in the Paris Climate Agreement, with 64 per cent opposing Trump’s decision to pull out of the commitment.

While the majority of Republicans still support Trump’s controversial withdrawal, 35 per cent say they “somewhat” or “strongly” oppose the decision.

Why climate change is important to US voters

The survey shows there is still substantial support for climate-damaging activities such as drilling and mining fossil fuels on public land in the US (45 per cent) and drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (33 per cent).

However, a much larger proportion of the voter base is aware of the potential benefits of green energy. Almost half (49 per cent) think that renewables could improve economic growth and provide new jobs, while 65 per cent think global warming is affecting the cost of livingin the US.

You are a law professor, right?

Yes.

Do you remember you were my law professor at UChicago?

I do not remember that. I apologize.

The professor can certainly be forgiven given the vast number of students he taught corporate law, including this unmemorable author. The topic of discussion was the corporate veil-piercing doctrine, which is notoriously unpredictable and the source of much disagreement in the legal community.

Our client was a landlord who sued a co-working space tenant for failure to pay rent. And the case was also brought against the tenant’s parent company under an alter-ego theory — that is, alleging the parent company (that did not sign the lease) should be liable for the debt of the defunct subsidiary tenant (that did sign) such that the corporate veil should be pierced.

Corporate veil-piercing doctrine

The law treats entities as separate and distinct from their shareholders, related entities and affiliates. Generally, the debt or obligations of an entity cannot be imputed to others. This separation, commonly referred to as the “corporate veil,” allows entities to internalize both the benefits and burdens of corporate actions, such as signing contracts, suing (and being sued) and complying with the law. The protections offered by the corporate veil (very rightly) encourage and cordon off risk. That is, the only skin in the game is the entity’s assets.

Due to its vital role in corporate America, the corporate veil is very difficult to pierce. Though standards vary across jurisdictions, a party seeking to pierce the corporate veil must generally show that “the owners, through their domination [of the corporate entity], abused the privilege of doing business in the corporate form to perpetrate a wrong or injustice against the plaintiff such that a court in equity will intervene.” Plaintiffs often try to meet this standard by demonstrating that:

The owners or shareholders controlled the entity to such an extent that the corporation had no independent existence, and they were merely alter egos of the corporation.

The corporate form was used fraudulently or for an improper purpose.

Such improper or fraudulent use of the corporation caused harm to the plaintiff.

The corporate entity must be disregarded to prevent an injustice.

If this standard is met, assets other than the entity’s (such as personal assets) can satisfy a judgment. It is thus critically important to follow corporate formalities and not abuse the corporate form.

Case study: Stockbridge v. Industrious

In Stockbridge 600 West Jackson, LLC v. Industrious National Management Co. LLC, the Illinois appellate court held that corporate veil-piercing was appropriate.

In 2018, Industrious National Management Company, a co-working space provider (like WeWork), approached Stockbridge 600 West Jackson about renting space in a Chicago office building. After Industrious National produced documents and articles touting its financial strength, Stockbridge agreed to a lease, which Industrious National’s single-member subsidiary LLC executed.

In 2020, shortly after the Covid-19 virus first surfaced, Industrious Jackson defaulted on the lease. As was later discovered in the underlying litigation, Industrious National had already decided to end its lease due to underperformance and used Covid-19 as its partial cover story. Industrious National told Stockbridge it would exit the location and not pay future rent, despite years of future rent obligations. Unbeknown to Stockbridge, Industrious National planned to move its co-working members to its other co-working spaces miles away. In its efforts to quietly move its members to the new location, Industrious National went so far as to instruct movers to “wear plain clothing” and “be discreet” in executing their plan.

In late 2020, after resolution attempts failed, Stockbridge sued Industrious Jackson (the tenant that signed the lease) and Industrious National (the parent company) for breach of the lease and fraudulent transfer of assets. Among other claims, the complaint alleged that Industrious Jackson failed to observe corporate formalities and was merely an alter ego of its only LLC member, Industrious National. Industrious National denied any responsibility under the lease, saying it was not a party to the lease, and suggested that Industrious Jackson effectively had no assets.

Following a week-long bench trial, the court held the corporate veil should be pierced and assigned liability to Industrious National, the parent company, finding:

Industrious Jackson was a “mere instrumentality” of Industrious National.

Industrious Jackson was used to commit a wrong or fraud.

Stockbridge suffered an unjust injury.

The Illinois appellate court affirmed.

As to the first “mere instrumentality” factor, the court examined “(1) whether the corporation [was] undercapitalized, (2) whether separate books [were] kept, (3) whether there [were] separate finances for the corporation, (4) whether the corporation [was] used for fraud or illegality, (5) whether corporate formalities [had] been followed, and (6) whether the corporation [was] a sham.”

Trial testimony revealed that Industrious Jackson failed to follow corporate formalities. For instance, Industrious Jackson did not have its own employees or officers, did not conduct meetings and did not negotiate its own contracts. Testimony also suggested that “funds flowed freely” between Industrious National and Industrious Jackson. According to the court, “Industrious National … made the decisions which directly led to this litigation, including the decisions to not use available funds to pay rent to Stockbridge Jackson, to create and implement the plan to transfer members to other locations … and to ultimately close the … location.”

Second, the court addressed whether it was established “that Industrious National engaged in deliberate wrongful conduct that either was designed to or did produce injury to Stockbridge Jackson.” Trial testimony supported a finding of “obfuscation or deception vis-à-vis Stockbridge Jackson.” The court found Industrious National had falsely suggested that it would be the tenant on the lease because it provided Stockbridge with its own profit/loss statements and balance sheets, as well as news articles hailing its financial strength. When Stockbridge offered concessions to keep Industrious Jackson as a tenant, Industrious Jackson did not negotiate in good faith and instead used delay tactics to continue using the space without paying rent.

And though Industrious National had enough funds to pay rent in April 2020, the company decided that Industrious Jackson would not make the payment. Instead, Industrious National helped move that location’s members, Industrious Jackson’s primary source of revenue, to one of its other seven co-working locations in Chicago, effectively depriving Industrious Jackson of the ability to pay rent. These facts supported the court’s finding that Industrious National exercised its control over Industrious Jackson “in such a manner as to wrong” Stockbridge.

Lastly, the court determined that Industrious National’s deliberate wrongful actions via Industrious Jackson caused Stockbridge to suffer significant loss. The court noted that Industrious National’s president acknowledged in his testimony that “[Industrious Jackson’s members] were paying rent, Stockbridge was paying its mortgage on the building, and the only one not paying was Industrious Jackson during that time.”

As with most veil-piercing cases, the court focused on whether the parent, Industrious National, had instructed its subsidiary to act in a way that was dishonest and intentionally harmed Stockbridge. The court found that because it had, the corporate veil was pierced.

Other key veil-piercing cases

Below is a summary of other key veil-piercing cases for illustration purposes.

EPLET v. DTE Pontiac North

Courts often focus on ownership and control in veil-piercing cases, which can be particularly challenging when multiple entities are involved. Courts often try to answer the question of which entity is ultimately responsible for the harmful actions.

For instance, EPLET, LLC v. DTE Pontiac North, LLC was a breach-of-contract case arising from General Motors’s bankruptcy. There, GM leased land to DTE Energy Pontiac North (DTEPN). DTEPN agreed to maintain the plant according to specific criteria and to resolve any environmental issues. DTEPN’s parent company, DTE Energy, guaranteed that DTEPN would meet these responsibilities, or DTE Energy itself would step in to fulfill the obligations. But when the lease expired, GM discovered that DTEPN had allowed the plant to fall into disrepair, leading to contamination of the property. GM sued both DTEPN and DTE Energy for breach of contract.

The Sixth Circuit held that DTE Energy should be liable for DTEPN’s alleged wrongs because the decision “to cease maintenance and allow the operational and overall condition of the Leased Premises to deteriorate” was actually made by DTE Energy. This lack of maintenance harmed the grounds, ultimately leading to the contractual breaches, according to the court. Because DTE Energy “exercised its control over DTEPN in a way that wronged [the GM trust],” corporate veil-piercing was appropriate.

People v. V&M Industries

Courts also turn to the presence of corporate formalities to determine whether an entity was a “shell” for its shareholders, members or owners.

In People v. V&M Industries, the state of Illinois sued V&M Industries after over 40,000 tires caught fire on the company’s property and caused significant environmental damage. The Illinois appellate court pierced the corporate veil and held the owner of V&M Industries personally responsible.

In 1981, an individual (Leirer) purchased property in Illinois and incorporated V&M Industries for the sole purpose of renting the property out. One of V&M Industries’ tenants brought tires onto the property to start a tire-shredding operation with Leirer. The agreement eventually fell apart, and the tenant abandoned the tires on the property.

The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency negotiated a tire-removal agreement with Leirer. During the negotiations, Leirer signed all the documents as an authorized representative of V&M Industries and consulted no other corporate officers about the agreement. A corporate meeting never took place on this issue. Leirer never complied with the agreement, and in 1994 the tires on the property caught fire.

The Illinois agency sued Leirer for injunctive relief and civil penalties, arguing that Leirer’s dealings demonstrated that V&M Industries was not separate and distinct from him, and the court agreed.

In its decision, the court held “[a] corporate entity will be disregarded if it would otherwise present an obstacle to the protection of private rights or if the corporation is an alter ego or business conduit of the governing or dominant personality.” The factors the court considered included:

Inadequate capitalization

Failure to issue stock

Failure to observe corporate formalities

Payment of dividends

Insolvency of the debtor corporation at the time

Nonfunctioning of other corporate officers or directors

Absence of corporate records

Whether the corporation is a mere façade for the operation of dominant stockholders

Because those factors were present, the court held the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency could recover civil penalties from Leirer himself such that the corporate veil was pierced.

Waste Conversion Technologies. v. Warren Recycling

To be sure, cases that involve asset transfers from parent corporations to subsidiaries or vice versa, as in Stockbridge 600 West Jackson, do not always result in a piercing of the corporate veil.

In Waste Conversion Technologies, Inc. v. Warren Recycling, Inc., the Sixth Circuit did not find that the corporate veil had been pierced, calling the doctrine a “blunt instrument.” Instead, the court held that fraudulent conveyance law permits creditors to recover the exact value of the asset transferred, making it a more suitable remedy.

The case involved a breach-of-contract claim between Waste Conversion, a middleman between construction companies and landfills, and Warren Recycling, a landfill operation owned by Anthony DiCenso and Gilbert Reiger. Warren Recycling leased the property for its landfill operation from T&G Enterprises/Waste Transfer, a partnership that was also owned by DiCenso and Reiger.

After Waste Conversion filed its complaint for breach of contract, DiCenso and Reiger began negotiating a deal with an outside buyer to sell the landfill operations, which included permits held by Warren Recycling and the land owned by T&G Enterprises/Waste Transfer. Though the deal fell through, Waste Conversion alleged that DiCenso and Reiger tried to get rid of Warren Recycling’s assets — transferring permits to T&G Enterprises/Waste Transfer for no money in return and paying excessive salaries to themselves and their family members — so that recovery would be impossible.

The Sixth Circuit found that these facts did not favor veil-piercing. Though T&G Enterprises/Waste Transfer shared the same ownership as Warren Recycling, T&G Enterprises/Waste Transfer was a distinct entity. During contract negotiations with Waste Conversion, DiCenso and Reiger did not represent that Warren Recycling and T&G Enterprises/Waste Transfer were the same entity. In fact, the court said, the two entities held different assets and separately observed corporate formalities.

In the same vein, the court found that Waste Conversion could not hold Warren Recycling’s shareholders, DiCenso and Reiger, liable. Under Ohio law, plaintiffs seeking to pierce the corporate veil must demonstrate that “the individual shareholders exercised complete control over the corporation so that the corporation had no separate mind of its own” (an alter-ego test), “the control was exercised to commit fraud” and “injury or unjust loss resulted.”

The court held that Warren Recycling’s corporate form was not “a mere shell for DiCenso and Reiger” because they were paid salaries. Nor was there any evidence that DiCenso and Reiger held out or used Warren Recycling’s funds as their own, that they used the corporate form to commit fraud or that they siphoned corporate funds for personal expenses.

But this refusal to pierce Warren Recycling’s corporate veil did not leave Waste Conversion without recourse. The court noted that there may have been a fraudulent conveyance because assets were transferred to shareholders (high salaries) and T&G Enterprises/Waste Transfer (rent and the permits) without receipt of reasonably equivalent value. The equitable solution to this problem, the court said, would be for Waste Conversion to use the bankruptcy courts and “get in line with all the other creditors.”

Best practices to prevent veil-piercing

To minimize the risk of veil-piercing, businesses should rigorously maintain corporate separateness and adhere to the following best practices:

Maintain distinct operations. Ensure each entity has separate bank accounts, corporate documents, meeting minutes, office space and decision-making processes.

Avoid commingling funds. Do not mix funds between entities. Document any inter-entity transactions in writing, at market terms and at arm’s length.

Adequate capitalization. Each entity should be sufficiently capitalized to meet its obligations independently.

Independent decision-making. All business decisions should be made by authorized agents of the entity, with clear documentation.

Proper use of entity name. Use the full legal name of the entity on all contracts and documents and ensure signatures are made on behalf of the correct entity.

Observe corporate formalities. Hold regular meetings, maintain accurate records and ensure all required filings and formalities are observed.

Avoid abuse of the corporate form. Understand that courts are more likely to pierce the veil where there is evidence of fraud, unfairness or abuse of the corporate structure.",https://www.corporatecomplianceinsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/separation-of-entities-concept-converging-bodies-of-water.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 08:57:59.412289

It was also the year that a vast majority of Wyomingites woke up to climate change, according to a University of Wyoming survey that showed 86% believe it is happening and they are alarmed at what it portends for the state’s scant water resources.

But Wyoming’s most significant energy headlines of 2025 — even beyond the proliferation of data center plans that would double the state’s electrical demand and intense debate over nuclear energy projects — were President Donald Trump’s sweeping, incessant slashing of federal regulations to boost fossil fuels and orders to rebuff renewable energy.

Sweeping federal policy

On his first day back in the White House, Trump signed the “Unleashing American Energy” executive order, which, among other things, directed federal agencies to repeal “all ‘greenhouse gas’ emissions standards for the power sector,” as well as Biden-era Mercury and Air Toxics Standards. The order also directed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to “reconsider” the landmark 2009 endangerment finding that determined greenhouse gases cause harm and compelled past administrations to curb their emissions.

The president tapped Wyoming’s own Cyrus Western, a former Wyoming lawmaker, to lead the EPA’s Region 8 office overseeing much of the Rockies Region, including Wyoming.

“I think President Trump has been really clear that he wants to take a very different direction and work with the states, help encourage industry, but also simultaneously ensuring that the communities do have access to clean water, that their air is clean, that kind of stuff,” Western told WyoFile in March.

The GOP-led Congress followed Trump’s lead in prioritizing fossil fuels in July with provisions in the Big Beautiful Bill that slashed royalty rates for coal, oil and natural gas. While cheered by Wyoming’s extractive industries, WyoFile reported the cuts will choke the flow of federal dollars — a $50 million annual loss for the state on coal royalties alone.

Still, Trump’s efforts won praise from Wyoming’s congressional delegation and Gov. Mark Gordon, who celebrated the “immediate change in approach” to federal energy policies and described the new direction as “a win for U.S. energy and Wyoming.”

Wyoming conservation groups decried the moves, which included an overhaul of the planning processes for public lands. The sweeping changes, they said, are a threat to the state’s wildlife and an outdoor recreation economy that heavily relies on federal public lands, including the already climate-stressed Red Desert.

“The Trump administration has obviously led with prioritizing extractive industries over all other uses on public lands,” Wyoming Outdoor Council Conservation Director Alec Underwood told WyoFile in September.

Coal lease flop

Trump’s effort to “unlock” federal coal reserves in Wyoming and Montana failed spectacularly, at the hands of a coal mining company with operations in the Powder River Basin.

Based on the premise that a Biden-era ban on future coal leasing in the region hamstrings a soon-to-be resurrected industry, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management scoured the books for federal coal leases that had gone dormant and could be put up for sale. The agency cleared the decks for a 167 million-ton coal lease auction in Montana for a single, apparent bidder, Navajo Transitional Energy Company. Before that auction took place, the administration announced it would also revive a years-long lingering 441 million-ton federal coal tract in Wyoming for auction — again, enticing the single, apparent bidder NTEC, which had not asked for the opportunity, a company official told WyoFile.

When the Montana federal coal auction came on Oct. 6, NTEC — the lone bidder — offered just $186,000. In 2012, the last time the industry demanded a major federal lease sale in the region, the bid was $1.10 per ton. This time around, NTEC’s fraction-of-a-penny per ton bid spurred the administration to indefinitely postpone the 441-million-ton auction scheduled for days later in Wyoming.

“It tells you that there’s no competition for that coal in the ground, and it’s not worth very much money,” Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis Energy Data Analyst Seth Feaster told WyoFile.

Despite those results, Wyoming’s congressional delegation in November led an effort to bypass the enshrined public-input process for crafting BLM land management plans by invoking the rarely used Congressional Review Act. The move invalidated the agency’s Wyoming and Montana resource management plans for the sole purpose — according to the delegation — of overturning the ban on future leasing. Trump signed the law in December.

Nuclear contention

Growing interest in nuclear energy proved particularly divisive in Wyoming.

While the $4 billion Natrium “advanced” nuclear power plant continued construction near Kemmerer and notched permitting milestones — thanks in part to Trump executive orders to fast-track such endeavors — the towns of Bar Nunn and Gillette weighed other high-dollar nuclear proposals.

California-based Radiant Industries both enthralled and alarmed Bar Nunn and Natrona County residents with its proposal to manufacture nuclear microreactors for global deployment. The plan, however, would have required an exception to Wyoming’s partial ban on spent nuclear fuel waste storage. The issue ignited tensions that drew political divisions and, ultimately, led to Radiant scrapping its Wyoming plans in October.

Longtime U.S. Navy contractor BWXT, meantime, introduced its own plans in Gillette: a nuclear fuel manufacturing plant that does not involve spent nuclear fuel storage. In December, Gordon awarded BWXT a $100 million grant to support the project.

Both proposals came amid intense legislative debate and a Gordon-backed Wyoming-Idaho-Utah alliance to center America’s nuclear energy resurgence in the region.

Climate contention

A whopping 86% of residents (compared to 55% in 2014) believe climate change is happening, University of Wyoming researchers reported. And, researchers said, most respondents didn’t know their neighbors felt the same.

There was evidence, though, when a crowd of voters in Pinedale booed Rep. Harriet Hageman when she used the phrase “absolutely based on false science” to describe the 2009 endangerment finding — the federal doctrine to combat air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. And when Freedom Caucus members sought to make carbon dioxide great again with a bill to outlaw greenhouse gas reduction efforts, their legislative colleagues shot it down.",https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Dirt-shovel-Belle-Ayr-coal-mine-DBleizeffer.jpeg?fit=1200%2C905&ssl=1,N,,2025-12-29 07:12:32.443591

On December 11, 2025, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Air and Radiation (OAR), launched a new webpage entitled the Clean Air Act Resource for Data Centers. The site centralizes regulatory data, modeling tools, and permitting guidance. Designed to accelerate data center construction, the OAR staff is also available for case-by-case consultations with permit authorities and developers. The website has three primary categories:

Regulator Resources: Focuses on power sources, a major concern for planning data centers and AI infrastructure. Common sources of primary and backup power are subject to New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for certain air emissions and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP).

Air Permitting Resources: Aggregates guidance documents and historical interpretation letters to see how EPA has handled similar permitting requests in the past, offering a clearer picture of statutory obligations under New Source Review (NSR) requirements and federal regulations.

Modeling Guidance: Provides access to the EPA’s “Guideline on Air Quality Models,” offering technical methods for demonstrating Clean Air Act (CAA) and NO2 National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) compliance during planning.

The EPA initiative aims to help businesses and communities navigate federal air quality rules, specifically under the Clean Air Act (CAA) requirements that EPA acknowledges are essential for pollution control. Officials stated the webpage will be updated continuously as the agency moves to reform industry guidance for data center developers.

The EPA did not specify what it intends to change, but said it will clarify how the regulations apply to modern facilities. The administration contends that streamlined development will ultimately protect consumers from rising electricity rates and cost-of-living increases.

According to the Georgetown Law Review, Bloomberg, and Utility Dive, communities and states that allow data center growth are experiencing substantial increases in utility costs, up to 267% over five years [1].

While it is not unusual for local taxpayers to cover part of the infrastructure costs, many consumers were unaware of just how substantial those costs are for data centers [2].

According to the Georgetown Law Review, there is currently no concise federal framework for regulating data center development, leaving regulation largely up to the individual states. However, a bill introduced by Senators Whitehouse and Fetterman, the Clean Cloud Act of 2025, would amend the Clean Air Act to set emissions standards for servers and other equipment used in data centers or crypto-mining facilities, and to require data collection on energy consumption. The Senate read the proposed bill and then referred it to the Committee on Environment and Public Works [3].

Electrical systems and ongoing energy systems account for the lion’s share of capital expenses and operational costs. There is a cost of land, but companies are now seeking to use Brownfields to obtain parcels closer to urban areas with more infrastructure.

The environmental impacts discussed here affect air quality because the massive amounts of electricity data centers consume to crunch data and keep systems cool are primarily generated by fossil fuels. Total global consumption of electrical power by data centers is anticipated to jump, with AI-optimized centers expected to see demand quadruple; AI’s share of data center power could rise from 5-15% to 35-50% by 2030 [4].

Our dependence is driving up carbon emissions and exacerbating global warming issues. Developing greener cooling methods for data centers will help minimize environmental impacts on air quality and reduce strains on local water resources for cooling [5]. That’s where SCS Engineers can help.

And the Maricopa County Air Quality Department is urging residents to help keep skies clearer for New Year’s 2026.

The Valley is shaped like a big bowl, and in the winter, cooler weather creates a pressure change that pushes pollution lower to the earth, trapping it right over the city, said Maricopa County Air Quality Department spokesperson Ari Halpert.

On New Year’s Eve, at-home fireworks supercharge the problem.

“Jan. 1, 2025 we had the third-worst air quality in the world, the worst in the nation, and the main culprit for that were consumer fireworks,” Halpert said. “We ask everyone to celebrate in a different way.”

The smoke was so thick last New Year’s Day that some parts of the Valley saw “hazardous” air quality conditions — the most severe category on the Environmental Protection Agency’s Air Quality Index.

Halpert said Valley residents can do their part to improve air quality this year by skipping at-home fireworks displays, and leaving pyrotechnics to the professionals.

“Professional fireworks explode up in the atmosphere and have a chance to disperse all that pollution, so it doesn’t pose as big of a threat as these consumer fireworks,” Halpert said.

Halpert said another important way to keep pollution at bay is not to burn wood in your fireplace or outdoor fire pit.

Halpert said smoke from wood burning and fireworks can be harmful to everyone. Tiny particulates get deep into the lungs, which can worsen respiratory issues like asthma or bronchitis.

“They also carry toxins that can reach our bloodstream and exacerbate or pose a danger to our cardiac health,” Halpert said.

For some qualifying residents, the department offers up to $2,000 to cover the costs of converting wood burning fireplaces to gas models.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/68c70db/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1500x788+0+28/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Flegacy%2Fs3fs-public%2Ffireworks-2020.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 08:58:04.053024

That means that the global market for cars that run on gas or diesel is shrinking, while the market for battery-powered cars is expanding — and China is dominating it.","The electric vehicle industry has taken a pummeling this year. The Trump administration, as expected, reversed a whole suite of federal policies that promoted or encouraged EVs.

California's ability to require the sale of EVs: gone. Federal rules about emissions and fuel economy — being rewritten. Federal penalties for car companies that sell too many gas guzzlers: zeroed out. The $7,500 federal tax credit? Kaput.

Meanwhile, automakers delayed or canceled a host of unprofitable EV plans.

The all-electric Ram 1500 REV was canceled before a single one was built. The all-electric Ford Lightning was discontinued despite some glowing reviews. (Both pickups will be replaced with extended-range electric vehicles, which come with both a big battery and a backup gas tank.)

The buzzy Volkswagen Buzz is still available in other countries, but no longer in the U.S. The GM Brightdrop van is no more. The list goes on.

As for sales? ""It's a roller-coaster ride,"" says Stephanie Valdez Streaty, who monitors EVs for the data and services company Cox Automotive.

Sales spiked in August and September, during the last weeks that the federal tax credit was available, as buyers rushed to take advantage of the expiring opportunity. Cox estimated EVs hit an all-time high of 11.6% of the new vehicle market in September. Then sales crashed by 50% in October.

But here's a twist.

""Among U.S. shoppers who are in [the] market for new vehicles, the interest in electric vehicles actually ticked up a bit after the tax credit went away,"" says Brent Gruber, who runs the EV practice at consumer insights company J.D. Power.

It's the EV story you might not have heard this year: Despite the political and product planning whiplash, consumer appetite for EVs has been on a very smooth ride.

Overall, about 25% of new car shoppers are very interested in buying an EV, according to J.D. Power surveys. And with minor fluctuations, ""it's held pretty consistent,"" Gruber says, despite what he calls the ""turbulence"" of this year.

""There's still a tremendous amount of interest,"" he says. ""And from an EV owner perspective, we continue to see high levels of satisfaction once people do get into those products."" In fact, EV owners are 94% likely to repurchase another EV for their next vehicle, he says.

BJ Birtwell runs the Electrify Expo, a traveling festival dedicated to EVs. He says EVs have suffered from being politicized, with a lot of right-of-center Americans rejecting them out of hand.

""There's still a cloud of skepticism around EVs across some parts of the country,"" he says. But put a skeptic behind the wheel of a new EV, he says, ""and I'll tell you what I see: Smiles for miles."" Test drives reveal the cars are fun to drive, he says, and a little research can show that charging at home is easier and cheaper than they thought.

An American slowdown

Still, while Americans remain interested in EVs, it's undeniable that battery-powered vehicles are taking off more slowly than industry execs expected a few years ago. That's not just because of the policy reversal; it's also because of market realities. For example, while charging might be easy at home, it's a hassle for apartment dwellers who don't have that option. Meanwhile, vehicle prices — a challenge for the entire auto market — are even higher for EVs. Lower fuel and maintenance costs can't always overcome that up-front sticker shock, even for people who are hypothetically interested in buying.

This slowdown will have global consequences for the environment and for human beings: It locks in higher carbon emissions and air pollution for years to come.

The legacy automakers, of course, have lost billions of dollars on the EV designs they've canceled or postponed. But the delay hurts more than just the big-name auto brands. A whole network of suppliers sell parts to the automakers, and they also bear the burden when plans change.

Ken O'Trakoun of RPM Partners works with auto suppliers in distress. ""The whiplash,"" he says, ""between demand going up and demand receding, it has impacted a number of suppliers."" They made investments in factories to supply automakers for vehicles that either aren't being made, or are being made at much lower volumes. ""It's pretty disruptive.""

The ""ripple effect"" from those suppliers ""creates impacts on jobs,"" Valdez-Streaty notes.

Automakers, too, have laid off or reassigned employees away from battery plants and EV production lines as part of their adjusted timelines.

A clear global trend

But while automakers are slowing their EV plans down significantly, they're not giving up on them, either.

Partly that's because of the enduring consumer interest; as long as there's a market, the automakers want to serve it. And partly that's because the automakers are all global companies. They want to be able to sell to the rest of the world, too.

""On a global scale, internal combustion engine cars already peaked back, like, eight or nine years ago,"" says Huiling Zhou, U.S. EV analyst for the research group BloombergNEF.

About one in four cars sold worldwide this year was electric, Zhou says — driven by China's remarkably fast embrace of those vehicles. And China, increasingly, is exporting cars around the world.

That means that the global market for cars that run on gas or diesel is shrinking, while the market for battery-powered cars is expanding — and China is dominating it.

If automakers want to compete around the world, they simply can't afford to get off the EV roller coaster.

In 2025, Western rare earth strategy evolved from PowerPoints to funded infrastructure:

Upstream mines like MP Materials and Lynas became state-backed assets.

Midstream separation plants in the U.S., Europe, and Australia secured billions in financing and broke ground.

Downstream magnet facilities began commercial production for the first time this century.

Heavy rare earths (Dy/Tb) remain the critical bottleneck:

Malaysia emerged as a strategic battleground.

New processing facilities from ReElement, Ucore, Carester, and ANSTO raced to break China’s 85% control of global refining capacity.

Despite aggressive U.S. policy momentum and President Trump’s optimistic 2026 timeline:

Structural gaps in refining capacity, feedstock availability, and permitting suggest true supply-demand balance for non-China magnets won’t arrive until 2028–2030.

This leaves defense, EV, and clean energy sectors exposed to sustained supply risk.

In 2025, rare earths stopped being a niche “materials story” and became a full-spectrum industrial race. President Trump’s administration, while we suggest needs to do far more to accelerate the ex-China rare earth element (REE) supply chain, deserves credit for generating what is certainty substantial momentum. The first such president to do this since the entire value chain was outsourced overthe past couple decades. The year delivered a surge ofgovernment-initiated financings, offtakes, and build-and-buy partnerships designed to pry open supply chains long locked inside China’s midstream. The plotline wasn’t subtle: secure the mine, build the refinery, control the magnet. And if you couldn’t do all three, you partnered with someone who could.

Below is the year’s big picture—organized by the only structure that matters in rare earths: upstream mining, midstream processing, and downstream magnets. Importantly this was an exciting year, part of a great supply chain reawakening.

Upstream: Mines Become National Assets

MP Materials (NYSE:MP) went from “America’s only major rare earth mine” to a state-backed industrial anchor. The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD)struck a long-term partnership with a $110/kg NdPr price floor andsupport aimed at scaling magnet output and domestic capability. The Pentagon would have access to 15% of the national rare earth “treasure trove.” Then came the geopolitical flourish: MP and Saudi national mining company Ma’aden inked a term sheet for a Saudi refining joint venture, explicitly framed as de-risking reliance on China.

The catch remains execution: scaling is brutal, and heavy rare earth feed (Dy/Tb) is still the hard part. An early inning in a nine inning game at least. But has MP Materials emerged as too big to fail?

Lynas Rare Earths (LYX.AC), the world’s largest ex-China producer, raised A$750 million and continued to prove that ex-China production is possible—but not easy. Its U.S. heavy processing ambitions in Texas ran into uncertainty and cost pressure, reinforcing a core truth: midstream in the West is slow, capital-intensive, and politically exposed. Meanwhile, Lynas deepened the Malaysia footprint and backed a magnet plant partnership with Korea’s JS Link, making Malaysia not a footnote but a battleground. Lynas recently shipped some heavy rare earths to offtake partners in Japan.

Lynas and Sumitomo have a long-standing strategic partnership, backed by Japan's Organization for Metals and Energy Security (JOGMEC), to secure stable supplies of rare earths (both light REEs and increasingly heavy REEs like Dysprosium/Terbium) for Japanese industry, especially magnets for EVs and wind turbines, with Sumitomo acting as a key distributor, diversifying away from China's dominance. Sumitomo also partners with others like MP Materials and Victory for even broader HRE supply.

Arafura Rare Earths (ARU.AX) pushed its Nolans project toward the brink of full construction readiness,bolstered by major financing momentum and heavyweight backing. Thesignal for investors: Australia is trying to turn rare earths into an export-grade industrial platform, not just a quarry.

Arafura Rare Earths looks promising because it is advancing one of the few fully integrated rare earth projects outside China—again, the Nolans Project in Australia—with a clear pathway to produce NdPr carbonates and downstream separated oxides, supported by strategic offtake agreements, established funding, and strong technical progress; its combination of substantial, high-quality ionic clay resources, experienced management, and proximity to emerging refining infrastructure positions it to be a cornerstone supplier into Western magnet and EV supply chains. The company needs to improve education and awareness about its’ potential.

USA Rare Earth **(NASDAQ:USAR)**aims to create a domestic ""mine-to-magnet"" supply chainfor critical REEs for defense & green tech, leveraging its Round Topproject in Texas for resources and partnering for magnet production. The key risks involve significant capital needs, complex permitting, competition from China, delays in mine development (Round Top is still exploratory), technical hurdles in refining magnet making (the group acquired Less Common Metals to mitigate some risk) and overall market volatility, despite strong government interest and potential, making it a speculative venture.

Serra Verde (backed by Denham Capital and Energy & Minerals Group) in Brazil delivered one of the year’s sharpest strategic moves: it shortened long Chinese offtake commitments to free up supply for Western buyers as new separation plants come online. It also had the kind of financing stamp Western governments now reserve for strategic minerals: a $465 million DFC loan. The message was blunt: heavy rare earths outside China are scarce, and those who have them get courted.

Aclara Resources (ARA.TO) announced plans for a $277 million heavy rare earth separation facility in Louisiana, with a timeline targeting end-2027 construction and production ramp thereafter—an explicit attempt to end the U.S. heavy rare earth dependency trap.

And in Africa-to-Australia integration, Iluka Resources (ILU.AX) secured a binding deal with Lindian Resources (LIN.AX) for 6,000 tpa of concentrate for 15 years—a rare case of upstream being contractually snapped into a midstream refinery plan.

In 2025, Pensana Plc (PRE.L) accelerated its Longonjo rare earth project in Angola while pivoting hard toward a U.S.-aligned “mine-to-magnet” strategy: it advanced mine development and construction planning, announced downstream partnerships to anchor future demand (including an MoU with rare earth recycling and refining specialist ReElement Technologies tied to potential U.S. refining integration and large-volume mixed rare earth carbonate offtake discussions), pursued U.S. government-linked financing via EXIM under supply-chain resiliency frameworks (explicitly positioning Longonjo output to qualify for U.S.-backed debt support), signed a magnet supply-chain linkage through a VAC/eVAC-related arrangement to connect Longonjo product into U.S. magnet manufacturing, and capped the year by securing a US$100 million strategic equity investment to fund drilling, mine development momentum, and the broader U.S. supply-chain pivot—steps that collectively signaled Pensana’s shift from a UK-centered refinery narrative toward U.S.-supported industrial policy gravity.

In 2025, Brazilian Rare Earths (BRE.XA) made significant strides in advancing its Monte Alto rare earth project by securing approximately A$120 million in financing to fund exploration, development, and early works, bolstering its financial position as one of the better-capitalized rare earth juniors. A cornerstone of BRE’s year was a strategic long-term partnership with French processor Carester, under which BRE agreed to supply heavy rare earth concentrate (with a focus on dysprosium and terbium) to Carester’s new Caremag separation plant in France for up to 10 years, effectively anchoring future processing of Brazilian product into a European midstream facility and de-risking future offtake. In return, Carester agreed to assist BRE in advancing its own refinery plans in Brazil and provided technical and commercial collaboration across the value chain, positioning BRE as a key supplier into European and allied rare earth supply networks outside China.

A partially American-owned startup called DTEC MMT arrived in Malaysia to secure upstream product paired with innovative refining options. What plans will the venture disclose in 2026?

What about rare earth mining veteran James Kennedy and the Pea Ridge mine. Supposedly substantial heavy rare earth can be derived from the tailings. Can Caldera Holding secure the capital to exploit the asset?

Midstream: Separation Plants Finally Leave the PowerPoint Stage

2025’s defining shift: processing ceased to be a “someday” ambition and became funded steel, poured concrete, and signed feedstock.

In the U.S., the year’s most consequential announcements attached real money to real capacity: Vulcan Elements + ReElement Technologies landed a substantial public-private package (700 million in direct U.S. Department of War (OSC) loans, $50 million in Commerce CHIPS Act incentives, and over $550 million in private capital) aimed at building domestic NdFeB magnets and expanding recycling and processing—an industrial chain from scrap to magnet.

ReElement Technologies touts an advanced chromatographic separation and purification platform—derived from patented research at Purdue University—to refine rare earth elements and critical battery metals from both virgin ores and recycled feedstocks such as end-of-life permanent magnets, lithium-ion batteries, and manufacturing waste. If this works at scale, this chromatography-based process could replace traditional solvent extraction, enabling high-purity rare earth oxides and critical elements with higher efficiency, lower energy use, drastically reduced waste, and a smaller environmental footprint compared with conventional methods, while also purportedly being modular, scalable, and deployable on smaller footprints or co-located with mine or manufacturing sites.

MP Materials as cited above secured $150 million from the government to develop heavy REE processing.

In 2025, Energy Fuels (UUUU) achieved significant rare earth refining milestones at its White Mesa Mill in Utah, focusing on establishing a fully domestic supply chain for magnet materials. Key accomplishments include the pilot production and qualification of heavy rare earth oxides (HREEs) and the successful use of its light rare earth oxide (LREE) product in commercial magnets. While mostly focused on processing uranium, the company’s refining focus positions it well for organic American REE refining growth.

Ucore Rare Metals' major 2025 milestones centered on advancing its U.S. heavy rare earth processing in Louisiana, securing significant funding (including a $18.4M DoD award), breaking ground on the Strategic Metals Complex (SMC) in May, and achieving key technology validations with the US DoD for HREE separation. Is the company positioned to build one of North America's first HREE separation facilities based on their RapidSX™ (opens in a new tab) technology?

In 2025,European rare earth refining has seen notable developments involving Solvay and Carester, both working to strengthen Western processing capacity outside China. Solvay expanded and inaugurated a rare earth production line at its La Rochelle, France facility in April 2025, beginning commercial production of materials for permanent magnets and later securing contracts to supply key rare earth oxides to U.S. magnet makers, underscoring its growing role in Western supply chains.

Meanwhile, French start-up Carester’s Caremag project in Lacq secured €216 million in financing in March 2025 to build a large-scale rare earth recycling and refining plant that aims to produce significant volumes of heavy and light rare earth oxides by 2026, positioning Europe to capture a meaningful share of global refined output. The two companies previously signed a strategic memorandum of understanding to collaborate on rare earth permanent magnet value-chain activities, combining Solvay’s industrial processing experience with Carester’s recycling and upstream expertise to bolster European refining autonomy.

Canada based Neo Performance Materials (NEO.TO) has made significant strides toward regional supply chain independence from China (although they still have at least two plants in China). Neo already operates Silmet, the only commercial rare earth separation plant in the EU located in Sillamäe, Estonia, and in September 2025 officially opened a new permanent rare earth magnet manufacturing facility in Narva, Estonia, marking the first large-scale production of rare earth magnets in Europe for electric vehicles and wind turbines and receiving attention from European Commission leadership as part of broader EU industrial policy support.

The Saskatchewan Research Council (SRC) in Canada has made significant progress toward establishing a vertically integrated rare earth refining capability in North America by constructing and advancing its state-of-the-art Rare Earth Processing Facility in Saskatoon,Saskatchewan. Since the project’s launch in 2020 withsubstantial provincial and federal support, SRC has developed proprietary hydrometallurgical, solvent-extraction, and metal smelting technologies in-house and has already achieved commercial-scale production of rare earth metals, notably high-purity NdPr, with plans to scale output further toward annual targets in the 400–600 tonne range—enough to support hundreds of thousands of electric vehicles.

SRC’s facility, slated for full operation by early 2027, has secured major offtake partnerships and feasibility studies for an expanded processing and metallization complex, reinforcing Saskatchewan’s role as a growing possible global hub for rare earth supply chain development and helping reduce North American dependence on overseas processors.

In Australia, the Iluka refinery strategy hardened around one key point: refineries are only as real as their feed contracts—hence the Iluka Resources and Lindian supply agreement and broader feedstock hunt.

Australia is hopefully set to close a critical gap in the global rare earth supply chain with the opening of its first open-access rare earth processing facility in early 2026, built and operated by Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) at Lucas Heights. Taxpayer-funded and designed as shared national infrastructure, the facility directly tackles the long-standing contradiction that saw Australia—one of the world’s top rare earth producers—export 100% of its concentrates overseas, largely to China, for refining. Purpose-built for clay-hosted and ionic adsorption deposits, the plant will enable end-to-end pilot-scale processing from desorption through impurity removal to separated oxides, with Australian Rare Earths’ Koppamurra project as the first test case.

Strategically, the move reflects a clear policy shift: acknowledging that rare earth refining, unlike mining, rarely emerges without sustained state support—a reality underpinning China’s roughly 85% control of global processing capacity. While the ANSTO facility materially de-risks metallurgy and breaks the chicken-and-egg deadlock between miners and processors, social license, permitting, and commercial viability remain unresolved, underscoring that public infrastructure can enable—but not guarantee—the success of rare earth supply chains outside China.

And then there’s Malaysia, where the world learned (again) that rare earths don’t just run through geology—they run through chemistry and politics. Malaysia is pushing to keep value-add at home (including a ban on raw exports), while courting foreign partners and navigating public pressure around processing footprints. Alongside Lynas, Southern Alliance Mining’s (QNS.SI) strategic entry into rare earths via MCRE underscored Malaysia’s emergence as a contested node—complete with regulatory friction and scrutiny. Known as “SAM” much of its business today is with Chinese buyers. Will that change in 2026?

Ground breaking of a $400 million critical metals refinery purportedly commenced in Nigeria with privately held Hasetins Commodities Limited.

Downstream: The Magnet Renaissance Begins

If 2024 was about mines and 2025 about refineries, 2025 also quietly became the year magnets started shipping.

In 2025, the DoD struck a multibillion-dollar public-private partnership with MP Materials to accelerate a sovereign U.S. rare earth magnet supply chain anchored by a new “10X Facility,” a second domestic magnet plant expected to begin commissioning in 2028 and bring total U.S. magnet production capacity to about 10,000 metric tons per year if all goes according to plan. Apple piled on with a $500 million commitment tied to a U.S. magnet supply chain and a new recycling facility—rare earth circularity as industrial policy.

Germany’s VACUUMSCHMELZE (VAC), through eVAC Magnetics, shipped some of the first U.S.-made commercial NdFeB magnets in this century from South Carolina—symbolism with industrial teeth.

In 2025, American rare earth magnet makers have marked several key milestones as the U.S. works to build more resilient domestic supply chains: Permag emerged in June 2025 as a unified brand consolidating Dexter Magnetic Technologies, Electron Energy Corporation (EEC), and Magnetic Component Engineering (MCE), creating the only vertically integrated North American producer of high-performance magnets (especially Samarium-Cobalt) and advancing DFARS-compliance efforts for defense and aerospace applications. EEC, now a core part of Permag, doubled its SmCo manufacturing capacity at its Pennsylvania facility to bolster U.S. domestic production and reduce reliance on imports. Arnold Magnetic Technologies expanded strategic supply agreements in 2025 to secure rare earth materials outside China and is investing in supply chain continuity and compliance with upcoming DFARS standards for NdFeB and SmCo magnets.

Meanwhile, Noveon Magnetics continued scaling its Texas rare-earth magnet facility, exemplifying broader U.S. efforts to grow commercial magnet capacity. The company has been producing American-made NdFeB magnets at commercial scale in San Marcos since 2023, and continue to actively ship finished magnets to customers.

These developments reflect a concerted industry push in 2025 to strengthen domestic rare earth magnet manufacturing across defense, automotive, and industrial sectors.

South Korean cable giant LS Cable & System (LS C&S) has announced intention to invest in rare earth magnet production in the U.S. According to announcements a $689 million facility in Chesapeake, Virginia meant to secure supply chains for EVs, defense, and aerospace. This expansion builds on their existing cable ventures and aims to create a complete rare earth value chain, from securing oxides to final magnet manufacturing.

Vulcan Element’s planned 10,000-ton magnet facility (with federal loans and private capital) signaled a new doctrine: the U.S. doesn’t want “some” magnets; it wants a scale platform and this deal, while early stage, is meant to support such an endeavor.

POSCO International, a large steelmaker in Korea, and its partner Star Group Industrial Co looking to develop magnet making with Arafura feedstock.

In 2025, JS Link America—the U.S. subsidiary of South Korea’s JS Link—announced a $223 million investment to build a rare earth permanent magnet manufacturing facility in Columbus, Georgia, as part of broader efforts to diversify Western supply chains and reduce reliance on China. The planned 130,000 sq ft plant, to be located in Muscogee Technology Park, is expected to produce about 3,000 tons of permanent magnets annually and create over 520 jobs in engineering, production, and management, with operations slated to begin in late 2027.

The project underscores Georgia’s growing role in critical minerals and advanced manufacturing, and reflects JS Link’s strategy of linking U.S. production with its other facilities—including a magnet plant nearing completion in Yesan, Korea—while targeting supply to key sectors such as electric vehicles, wind energy, electronics, and defense systems

On the topic ofmagnets, the underlying truth is ruthless: magnets are the value capture point. Whoever owns magnets owns the downstream leverage over EVs, wind, drones, missiles, robotics—modern industry’s muscle memory.

While President Trump has publicly declared that the United States will soon have “more magnets than it knows what to do with” by the end of 2026, Rare Earth Exchanges’ modeling suggests a far more constrained reality. Even with accelerated mine development, new processing capacity, and a wave of announced magnet plants, the tightest bottleneck—ex-China rare earth refining and magnet-grade material availability—remains unresolved.

According to Rare Earth Exchanges’ simulations, persistent structural gaps in heavy rare earth separation, qualified feedstock availability, workforce readiness, and permitting timelines make true supply–demand balance for domestically produced, non-China magnets unlikely before 2028—and quite possibly not until 2030 or later—leaving U.S. automakers, defense contractors, clean-energy manufacturers, and fast-scaling sectors such as drones, robotics, and advanced electronics exposed to sustained supply risk well beyond today’s political timelines.

The Year-End Takeaway

In 2025, ex-China rare earth strategy moved from aspiration to architecture. Upstream projects secured lifelines. Midstream refineries stopped being theoretical. Downstream magnets began to ship. But the vulnerabilities didn’t disappear—they became clearer:

Execution risk is the tax on every Western project.

Heavyrare earths (Dy/Tb) remain the tightest choke point, extremely tight.

Malaysia is now a strategic arena, not a side plot.

Vietnam declared at end of year it’s treasure trove will not be available without processing investment

And industrial policy is back—not as ideology, but as emergency construction.

While President Trump’s administration gets a solid A for intent, initiation and leadership, the team, unfortunately still grades lower for the necessary rare earth and critical mineral industrial policy comprehensiveness and durability necessary for true resilience within the next several years. We need to work on Washington DC in 2026 to intensify and accelerate such efforts.

2025 didn’t end China’s dominance.

Grid connection limitations and their impacts on BESS development

With Clean Horizon, March 2025

One of the main limiting factors for BESS development in Europe is access to the grid. Indeed, with large amounts of renewable projects being deployed, the grid’s accommodation capacity is reaching saturation in almost all European countries.

Finding the correct grid connection option for a BESS project is therefore on the critical path of any BESS developer, typically with an even stronger priority than finding a suitable land plot. Clean Horizon’s expert team shares its observations and industry best practices used to continue developing storage projects.

Demystifying the BESS performance metrics that matter most: SoC, SoH, cell imbalance and RTE

With Wärtsilä, October 2025

In the rapidly evolving global energy landscape, battery energy storage has emerged as a cornerstone for ensuring grid stability and efficiency. From helping stabilise data centre loads, to being deployed as a means of grid modernisation, to supporting the proliferation of renewables, as the world transitions towards widespread electrification, the role of BESS becomes increasingly critical.

However, misunderstood metrics are quietly eroding the performance and profitability of these systems.

Wärtsilä battery analytics experts Andrea Meister and Steve Merrick present a critical session that cuts through the confusion surrounding state of charge (SoC), state of health (SoH), cell imbalance, and round-trip efficiency (RTE)—parameters that directly impact real-time operations and revenue.",https://www.energy-storage.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ESN-Virtual-BG-for-webinars_1280x720-1-flipped.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 10:01:00.808735
,Congress,2025-12-29 10:32:26+00:00,NOTUS,Senior Lawmakers Are Sprinting from 'Toxic' Congress. Why Are Freshmen Sticking Around?,Not Available,,,,,https://www.notus.org/congress/freshman-lawmakers-congressional-approval-ratings,"And as new members look on at the senior lawmakers sprinting from Capitol Hill, they sympathize.
But unlike the senior members who have been beaten down by those realities, the freshmen have chosen to jump into Congress — and stick around to repair it.
“Everyone hates Congress,” Rep. Suhas Subramanyam of Virginia told NOTUS, “and people feel the same frustration I feel about the institution.
“Things are slower,” Republican Rep. Julie Fedorchak told NOTUS.
But there are, of course, fundamental challenges with the premise that members of Congress can keep their heads down and form collegial relationships.","“One of the big reasons I wanted to run for Congress was to actually fight back against the toxic environment that is pervasive here,” Rep. Johnny Olszewski said from his office on Capitol Hill on a dreary December Wednesday.

“I joke with constituents back home,” he said. “They ask me, ‘Is D.C. really as bad as it seems?’”

“I say, ‘No. It’s worse.’”

Olszewski, a 43-year-old Maryland Democrat on the cusp of finishing out his first year in Congress, laughed in a way that made clear he had practiced the punchline. But over the course of an interview with NOTUS, it became apparent that the congressman wasn’t kidding.

The performative nature of national politics in 2025 has been more theatrical, and personal, than Olszewski had imagined. Getting to know Republican colleagues has been harder than he’d anticipated. Policymaking has been more dilatory than the local politics to which he had become accustomed. Commuting, even back to his district in Baltimore, is more taxing than expected. And, once, when Olszewski proposed what he thought was a common-sense amendment to a government funding bill — only one lawmaker showed up to a Rules Committee hearing to consider it.

“There’s a reason that Congress has a 13% — or whatever abysmal approval rating the institution has,” he said. “It’s deserved.””

And yet, as he relayed his myriad frustrations, Olszewski knew he would be running again. In fact, he had just filed for reelection.

“I believe nothing is beyond redemption,” he said. “I don’t think people are beyond redemption. I don’t think this institution is beyond redemption, because, at the end of the day, the institution is a reflection of the people.”

In offices throughout Capitol Hill, freshman lawmakers offered similar refrains. And as new members look on at the senior lawmakers sprinting from Capitol Hill, they sympathize.

Many lawmakers have decided that the legislative branch is beyond repair. Republican Rep. Andy Biggs, who is running for governor of Arizona, told NOTUS that Congress is “irredeemable.” Rep. Victoria Spartz, who has threatened to quit Congress, told NOTUS the House has “a lot of perverse incentives for people to govern and do politics.” Rep. Michael McCaul, who is retiring, described “partisanship, rancor, vitriolic debate, demonizing the other side of the aisle” as a motivator for his exit.

But unlike the senior members who have been beaten down by those realities, the freshmen have chosen to jump into Congress — and stick around to repair it.

“Everyone hates Congress,” Rep. Suhas Subramanyam of Virginia told NOTUS, “and people feel the same frustration I feel about the institution. But it’s also an opportunity right now to fix something that’s clearly broken.”

But this year’s momentous fights over the speakership, Medicaid, the bounds of executive authority, government funding and the release of the so-called Epstein files have tested even the most patient and optimistic lawmaker’s fortitude — especially given Republicans’ narrow majorities in the House and the Senate.

“Things are slower,” Republican Rep. Julie Fedorchak told NOTUS. “This is a numbers game, and I knew that coming in. But it just becomes more real when you’re super excited about policy ideas, and you think that they make so much sense that it’s just gonna, ‘Everybody should agree with this.’ And then you get to the like, ‘Oh, I gotta get 218,’ and it’s a lot harder than you thought.”

Five freshmen who spoke to NOTUS offered the same solution to make Congress a healthier place to work: prioritizing making relationships over making news.

Part of accomplishing that goal — both Republicans and Democrats say — will involve lawmakers getting to know members across the aisle. But doing so while balancing a commute between Washington and their districts requires extra effort.

Rep. Emily Randall, of Washington state, signed up for a fact-finding trip to Alaska with other members so she could spend time with her colleagues on the Natural Resources Committee.

“I wanted to have meals outside of C-SPAN cameras and get to know them,” Randall said. “And I’m really, really glad I went. We had some interesting policy discussions, but for the most part, it was about, like, getting to know about people’s families and, like, what inspired them to run in the first place. And how, if they’ve ever been fishing, and you know how they think about, like, our role alongside salmon in the world in like, a very touchy-feely way.”

Olszewski said one Monday Night Football pizza party with Republican Rep. Jeff Hurd and other freshmen served a similar purpose for him. Fedorchak brought up the bipartisan softball game as “probably the greatest tool I had to get to know members from the other party.”

“With our freshman class, you get a lot of people who are not looking to get in the news for the sake of getting in the news, not looking to stir up unnecessary issues or trouble. You get a lot of people who are looking to push the country in the right direction,” Rep. Brandon Gill, the freshman class president, told NOTUS.

“The more we get members who are willing to do that and ready to do the hard work, the faster we’re going to move the country in the right direction,” he said.

But there are, of course, fundamental challenges with the premise that members of Congress can keep their heads down and form collegial relationships. Gill — a staunch conservative — hasn’t been immune to attention-grabbing, provocative tactics. In February, he sent out a fundraising email that included a petition to “arrest and deport” progressive Rep. Ilhan Omar. He led the charge to add President Donald Trump’s face to the $100 bill. And he regularly appears on conservative media outlets.

And yet, even Gill professed a desire to get back to a Congress that rewards workhorses over partisan showhorses.

“I’m not willing to give up on the promise of our democracy and on our government,” Randall said. “I’m like, sort of a natural optimist. But I guess I believe in, like, the institution less than like, the power of people to build something good. I also believe in the power of people to like, do terrible things. But you know that there are enough people here who, I believe, believe that they are here for the right reasons.”

At least, for some members, complaining about the bleak reality of Capitol Hill is a first step toward healing.

“Has it gotten better since I got here? Probably not, but certainly we’re at least bringing awareness to how it’s dysfunctional,” Subramanyam said, “and hopefully we’ll start to make incremental changes in the right direction.”

In a world where technical competence is becoming a strategic weapon, knowledge will be the new fuel of economic independence.
Without a doubt, the battle for critical minerals is, in reality, a battle for the future.","The world is undergoing a tectonic shift in the economic and geopolitical balance, driven by a new global competition: access to critical minerals and rare earths – essential components for electric vehicle batteries, artificial intelligence chips, wind turbines, smartphones, drones and cutting-edge military technologies.

A world on the brink of a new race for resources

If oil was the fuel of the 20th century, lithium, cobalt, nickel, gallium, neodymium, and dysprosium are the ‘technological gold’ of the 21st century. Every gram of scarce material today equals a strategic advantage in the economy of the future.

Until recently, China controlled almost 90% of the world’s rare earths production and refining and has been accused of using this monopoly as a tool to pressure in trade negotiations with the West. The response was not long in coming: The United States and its allies have embarked on an economic offensive to break dependence on supply chains controlled by China.

The US and the new architecture of mineral alliances

After returning to the White House, President Donald Trump repositioned the issue of critical resources as an economic security priority. In just a few months, Washington has signed a series of strategic agreements aimed at diversifying its supply sources.

The US-Japan agreement, signed in Tokyo, establishes a framework for cooperation in the exploitation and processing of rare minerals essential to the high-tech and automotive industries. The aim is to protect supply chains and support joint investments in extraction and refining.

The US-Malaysia partnership, signed in Kuala Lumpur, guarantees Americans access to more than 16 million tons of Malaysian reserves. In return, Washington reduced customs tariffs and provided technological support for the development of local industry. Moreover, the US-Thailand protocol, a preliminary agreement, opens up a new area of cooperation for rare minerals in Southeast Asia.

The US administration did not stop at diplomacy, so Washington invested directly in mining companies in Canada and Australia (Lithium Americas, Trilogy Metals, Lynas), launched a strategic mineral reserve, and set a guaranteed minimum price for rare earths to reduce vulnerability to market fluctuations. In parallel, it relaxed environmental regulations to speed up the construction of mines and processing plants.

In just one year, the value of shares in US mining companies has doubled, a sign that the market is anticipating fierce competition and a resurgence of the Western extractive industry.

China strikes back: New export restrictions on sensitive technologies and materials

Beijing, feeling pressure to reorganize global supply chains, has introduced new restrictions on the export of sensitive technologies and materials. In July 2025, the Chinese government imposed special authorization for the export of magnets containing even trace amounts of rare earths. Five other strategic items have recently been added to the export control list. With these decisions, China is sending a clear message: “Without our resources, your technological progress will slow down.”

This strategy is not new, because in 2010 Beijing reduced exports to Japan following a maritime conflict, causing an industrial crisis. Today, however, the context is much more complex. Western countries try to develop alternatives, and the ‘geography of resources’ becomes a new map of global power.

A world divided into spheres of influence

Tensions between the US and China over access to raw materials risk fragmenting the global economy into two distinct blocs.

On the one side we have the Western Bloc (US, EU, Japan, Australia, Australia, Canada, South Korea) – based on joint investments, diversification, sustainability and partnerships with emerging economies, and on the other side the Euro-Asian Bloc (China, Russia, Iran, some African and Latin American countries) – focused on resource control and politically conditioned exports. This competition is reshaping trade routes and international alliances.

Amid conflicts and sanctions, Russia has repositioned itself as an alternative supplier of uranium and heavy metals, earning more than USD 1.2 billion from exports to the US in 2025. At the same time, Africa – from the Democratic Republic of Congo to Namibia – is becoming the terrain of the new ‘cobalt rush’, where Chinese, American and European investment intersects with local interests and geopolitical tensions.

So, it is no exaggeration to say that critical minerals have become a new strategic weapon, as important as technology or weapons.

Direct link to new industries: AI, automotive and IT

At the heart of this dispute is the revolution in artificial intelligence and emerging technologies. Every AI server, every high-performance processor, every electric car battery consumes impressive amounts of lithium, cobalt, graphite, gallium and neodymium. For example, a single electric car can require over 30 kg of rare earths, and a state-of-the-art AI data centre consumes critical materials equivalent to the output of a small mine!

Thus, the industry of the future is trapped by the resources of the present. Amid these tensions, global investors are reacting with caution. The volatility in US stock markets, recently reported by XTB Romania, reflects concerns that a protracted trade conflict could derail global economic growth and add to inflationary pressures. But behind all this friction, a clear reality is emerging; critical minerals are the key to the global energy and technology transition.

Romania and the expertise of the University of Petrosani – potential in a new global context

In this new economic order, Romania has significant strengths, but they are still insufficiently exploited. Romania has important mineral resources (copper, graphite, wolfram, molybdenum, lithium) and a solid university infrastructure in geology, mining and natural resources engineering.

A prime example is the University of Petrosani, an institution with over 75 years of tradition in training specialists in mining, energy, and geotechnics.

“At a time when the world is facing an urgent need for engineers, geologists and specialists in mining economics, graduates from Petrosani can play a strategic role. They can contribute not only to the reindustrialization of Romania, but also to the integration of the country in the European value chains for critical resources, promoted by the European Union through the European Critical Raw Materials Act,” says the Rector of the University of Petrosani Sorin Mihai Radu.

Amid geopolitical pressures and the need for energy autonomy, Europe is looking for domestic sources and local expertise. Romania, with its mining tradition and top technical schools, has the potential to become a regional centre of expertise in exploration, recovery and recycling of critical materials. From developing new clean extraction technologies, to research into the recovery of mining waste and training a new generation of engineers for the energy and IT industries, the potential is huge.

A delicate balance between resources, technology and power

At the moment, the critical resource crisis is not just an economic competition, but also a test of global vision and responsibility. In the years to come, the power of states will no longer be measured by GDP or military arsenal alone, but by their ability to ensure a steady flow of raw materials for the technologies of the future.

In this context, Romania must look to the future with clear-sightedness and ambition. The country has resources, industrial tradition and capable people. A coherent strategy sustained investment and an overall vision linking education, research and industry are still missing.

The University of Petrosani, through its specialists and graduates, can be one of the pillars of this reconstruction. In a world where technical competence is becoming a strategic weapon, knowledge will be the new fuel of economic independence.

Without a doubt, the battle for critical minerals is, in reality, a battle for the future. Whoever controls the resources controls the technology. And whoever controls the technology controls the world.

Romania should not be a mere spectator, as with intelligence, vision and investment in education it can become an active part of this new global order. Will it succeed?",https://energyindustryreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/european-battery-alliance-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 07:12:43.731344

About one in four cars sold worldwide this year was electric, Zhou says — driven by China's remarkably fast embrace of those vehicles.
That means that the global market for cars that run on gas or diesel is shrinking, while the market for battery-powered cars is expanding — and China is dominating it.","The electric vehicle industry has taken a pummeling this year. The Trump administration, as expected, reversed a whole suite of federal policies that promoted or encouraged EVs.

California's ability to require the sale of EVs: gone. Federal rules about emissions and fuel economy — being rewritten. Federal penalties for car companies that sell too many gas guzzlers: zeroed out. The $7,500 federal tax credit? Kaput.

Meanwhile, automakers delayed or canceled a host of unprofitable EV plans.

The all-electric Ram 1500 REV was canceled before a single one was built. The all-electric Ford Lightning was discontinued despite some glowing reviews. (Both pickups will be replaced with extended-range electric vehicles, which come with both a big battery and a backup gas tank.)

The buzzy Volkswagen Buzz is still available in other countries, but no longer in the U.S. The GM Brightdrop van is no more. The list goes on.

As for sales? ""It's a roller-coaster ride,"" says Stephanie Valdez Streaty, who monitors EVs for the data and services company Cox Automotive.

Sales spiked in August and September, during the last weeks that the federal tax credit was available, as buyers rushed to take advantage of the expiring opportunity. Cox estimated EVs hit an all-time high of 11.6% of the new vehicle market in September. Then sales crashed by 50% in October.

But here's a twist.

""Among U.S. shoppers who are in [the] market for new vehicles, the interest in electric vehicles actually ticked up a bit after the tax credit went away,"" says Brent Gruber, who runs the EV practice at consumer insights company J.D. Power.

It's the EV story you might not have heard this year: Despite the political and product planning whiplash, consumer appetite for EVs has been on a very smooth ride.

Overall, about 25% of new car shoppers are very interested in buying an EV, according to J.D. Power surveys. And with minor fluctuations, ""it's held pretty consistent,"" Gruber says, despite what he calls the ""turbulence"" of this year.

""There's still a tremendous amount of interest,"" he says. ""And from an EV owner perspective, we continue to see high levels of satisfaction once people do get into those products."" In fact, EV owners are 94% likely to repurchase another EV for their next vehicle, he says.

BJ Birtwell runs the Electrify Expo, a traveling festival dedicated to EVs. He says EVs have suffered from being politicized, with a lot of right-of-center Americans rejecting them out of hand.

""There's still a cloud of skepticism around EVs across some parts of the country,"" he says. But put a skeptic behind the wheel of a new EV, he says, ""and I'll tell you what I see: Smiles for miles."" Test drives reveal the cars are fun to drive, he says, and a little research can show that charging at home is easier and cheaper than they thought.

An American slowdown

Still, while Americans remain interested in EVs, it's undeniable that battery-powered vehicles are taking off more slowly than industry execs expected a few years ago. That's not just because of the policy reversal; it's also because of market realities. For example, while charging might be easy at home, it's a hassle for apartment dwellers who don't have that option. Meanwhile, vehicle prices — a challenge for the entire auto market — are even higher for EVs. Lower fuel and maintenance costs can't always overcome that up-front sticker shock, even for people who are hypothetically interested in buying.

This slowdown will have global consequences for the environment and for human beings: It locks in higher carbon emissions and air pollution for years to come.

The legacy automakers, of course, have lost billions of dollars on the EV designs they've canceled or postponed. But the delay hurts more than just the big-name auto brands. A whole network of suppliers sell parts to the automakers, and they also bear the burden when plans change.

Ken O'Trakoun of RPM Partners works with auto suppliers in distress. ""The whiplash,"" he says, ""between demand going up and demand receding, it has impacted a number of suppliers."" They made investments in factories to supply automakers for vehicles that either aren't being made, or are being made at much lower volumes. ""It's pretty disruptive.""

The ""ripple effect"" from those suppliers ""creates impacts on jobs,"" Valdez-Streaty notes.

Automakers, too, have laid off or reassigned employees away from battery plants and EV production lines as part of their adjusted timelines.

A clear global trend

But while automakers are slowing their EV plans down significantly, they're not giving up on them, either.

Partly that's because of the enduring consumer interest; as long as there's a market, the automakers want to serve it. And partly that's because the automakers are all global companies. They want to be able to sell to the rest of the world, too.

""On a global scale, internal combustion engine cars already peaked back, like, eight or nine years ago,"" says Huiling Zhou, U.S. EV analyst for the research group BloombergNEF.

About one in four cars sold worldwide this year was electric, Zhou says — driven by China's remarkably fast embrace of those vehicles. And China, increasingly, is exporting cars around the world.

That means that the global market for cars that run on gas or diesel is shrinking, while the market for battery-powered cars is expanding — and China is dominating it.

If automakers want to compete around the world, they simply can't afford to get off the EV roller coaster.

“The scale of cancellations shows how fragile this moment is for America’s clean energy economy,” says Michael Timberlake, director of research at E2.
The majority of the cancelled projects are factories, not clean energy generation plants, though some solar or wind farms may not show up on the list because their cancellations are harder to track.

Some companies are still announcing new projects, but lost investments are now outpacing them by three to one. “The scale of cancellations shows how fragile this moment is for America’s clean energy economy,” says Michael Timberlake, director of research at E2.

The list includes a new $4.3 billion General Motors EV plant in Michigan that’s being retooled to make gas-powered vehicles, a $3.2 billion Stellantis battery factory in Illinois that was cancelled, and a $2.6 billion battery factory in Georgia that was scrapped by a Norway-based manufacturer, among dozens of other projects. The majority of the cancelled projects are factories, not clean energy generation plants, though some solar or wind farms may not show up on the list because their cancellations are harder to track. (Though there is some evidence the administration is changing its mind about batteries, specifically.)

The cuts add up to nearly 40,000 lost jobs, according to E2. Republican congressional districts lost the most large-scale projects, 37 in total.

What’s harder to track than cancellations is how many projects might have been announced under different political conditions that now won’t ever break ground. Up until the 2024 election, Timberlake says monthly announcements consistently exceeded $1 billion in investment. Last month, that total was $550 million—less than the value of the cancelled battery project.

Cheaper than new nuclear reactors The total investment is estimated at $1.8 to $2.1 billion.
Converted per megawatt, that would be significantly cheaper than building a new nuclear power plant or even a modern small modular reactor.
It is precisely this cost advantage that makes the idea interesting for parties struggling with the rapidly increasing energy demand of hyperscale data centers.
The rise of AI is driving explosive growth in data centers, with traditional energy sources increasingly falling short.","A Texas-based energy company has come up with a striking proposal to meet the rapidly growing power consumption of AI data centers. The company wants to give decommissioned nuclear reactors from the US Navy a second life as an energy source for large-scale AI infrastructure.

As reported by SiliconANGLE , the plan comes from HGP Intelligent Energy, which is seeking financial support from the US Department of Energy through a loan guarantee. With this support, the company wants to launch a project aimed at providing continuous, sustainable power to data centers running heavy AI workloads.

This involves two nuclear reactors that previously served on US Navy aircraft carriers and submarines. These reactors would be installed at a special data center campus near Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, a location with a long history in nuclear research and technology.

The reactors HGP is targeting are known as pressurized water reactors, a type that has been reliably used by the Navy for decades. They are designed for long-term use and are known for their robust safety profile. According to the plans, together they would be able to supply between 450 and 520 megawatts of constant power, enough to support energy-intensive AI training and inference without interruptions.

Cheaper than new nuclear reactors

The total investment is estimated at $1.8 to $2.1 billion. Converted per megawatt, that would be significantly cheaper than building a new nuclear power plant or even a modern small modular reactor. It is precisely this cost advantage that makes the idea interesting for parties struggling with the rapidly increasing energy demand of hyperscale data centers.

Technically speaking, reusing these reactors does not seem to be an insurmountable problem. The biggest challenge lies in the regulations. Nuclear installations for military use fall outside the existing frameworks for civilian energy production. Moreover, the reactors are sealed and use highly enriched fuel, which does not comply with the current licensing procedures for commercial nuclear power plants in the United States.

Nevertheless, HGP is convinced that these obstacles can be overcome. The company argues that the necessary knowledge is already available and that it is working with investors and partners who have confidence in the safe and scalable implementation of the plan.

The proposal highlights the increasing pressure on the US power grid. The rise of AI is driving explosive growth in data centers, with traditional energy sources increasingly falling short. Large cloud and infrastructure companies are therefore looking to nuclear energy as a stable and emission-free solution, ranging from existing power plants to new reactor concepts and long-term power purchase agreements.",https://www.techzine.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Datacenter-op-kernenergie.png,N,,2025-12-29 04:13:16.240703

During a year full of headline-grabbing destruction of U.S. clean energy policy, renewables still led the way.
The most important thing we saw this year is that Trump simply can’t stop the energy transition.
To be specific: Electricity demand is growing quickly in the U.S., and clean energy is the least expensive and most readily available way to keep pace.
The Trump administration would certainly prefer to meet rising demand with coal and gas, but in many cases it’s simply impractical.","Five and a half months. That’s all the time Donald Trump needed to crush the only major climate law the United States ever managed to pass. It was swift work, using a sledgehammer and not a scalpel, and now the energy transition will have to make do with the fragments of the law that remain.

The words bleak and dispiriting come to mind. How else to describe the fact that the U.S. entered the year implementing an ambitious if inadequate decarbonization law, and is now exiting 2025 with that law all but repealed?

But there were also some reasons to be hopeful about the energy transition this year — if you knew where to look.

Let’s start with the numbers. During a year full of headline-grabbing destruction of U.S. clean energy policy, renewables still led the way. Through November, a whopping 92% of all new electricity capacity built in the U.S. came in the form of solar, batteries, and wind power. Electric vehicle sales hit a record, too — nearly 440,000 in the third quarter of the year — though the surge was driven in large part by consumers rushing to buy EVs before the disappearance of a federal tax credit axed by Trump.

There were also intriguing moments of alignment between Trump’s ​“energy dominance” agenda and the transition away from fossil fuels. Geothermal and nuclear are two sources of carbon-free energy that the administration has, for whatever reasons, deemed desirable. So while the One Big Beautiful Bill Act eviscerated much of President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, it spared tax credits for geothermal systems. And Trump has not only preserved Biden-era funding for nuclear projects but expanded it — possibly by orders of magnitude if an $80 billion plan for partially state-owned nuclear reactors actually happens.

The most important thing we saw this year is that Trump simply can’t stop the energy transition. Sure, he can slow it. He already has. But try as the administration might, there are forces at play bigger and more stubborn even than politics.

To be specific: Electricity demand is growing quickly in the U.S., and clean energy is the least expensive and most readily available way to keep pace.

The Trump administration would certainly prefer to meet rising demand with coal and gas, but in many cases it’s simply impractical.

Coal is increasingly the most expensive form of electricity. Gas, for better or for worse, certainly will help meet some of this new demand — but it faces very real supply-chain constraints. Gas turbines are sold out among major manufacturers, with wait times stretching as long as seven years.

When the country is clamoring for more electrons and voters are increasingly upset about rising power bills, and the only thing that can be built quickly is solar and storage, renewables will simply have to be built. (They’ll just cost more than they would have without Trump.)

So while it hasn’t been a good year for clean energy in the U.S., the transition now has enough momentum that even a terrible year amounts to more of a slowdown than a derailment. It’s a matter of inertia.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-2223602335.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=fd27af1ba68e7d0733eac7739d10114c,N,,2025-12-29 04:13:25.676763

It seemed as if every week brought a new, higher forecast of just how much electricity the data centers that run AI models will need. Amid the deluge of discussion, an urgent question arose again and again: How can we prevent the computing boom from hurting consumers and the planet?

We’re not bidding 2025 farewell with a concrete answer, but we’re certainly closer to one than we were when the year started.

To catch you up: Tech giants are constructing a fleet of energy-gobbling data centers in a bid to expand AI and other computing tools. The build-out is encouraging U.S. utilities to invest beaucoup bucks in fossil-fueled power plants and has already raised household electricity bills in some regions. Complicating things further is that many of today’s proposed data centers may never get built, which would leave the rest of us to foot the bill for expensive and unnecessary power plants that bake the planet.

It’s all hands on deck to find solutions. Lawmakers across every state considered a total of 238 bills related to data centers in 2025 — and a whopping half of that legislation was dedicated to addressing energy concerns, according to government relations firm MultiState.

Meanwhile, the people who operate and regulate our electric grid worked on rules to get data centers online fast without breaking the system. One idea in particular gained traction: Let the facilities connect only if they agree to pull less power from the grid during times of über-high demand. That could entail literally computing less, or outfitting data centers with on-site generators or batteries that kick in during these moments.

Even the Trump administration got in on the action, with Energy Secretary Chris Wright directing federal regulators in October to come up with rules that would let data centers connect to the grid sooner if they agree to be flexible in their power use. But this idea of ​“load flexibility” is still largely untested and has its skeptics, who argue that it’s technically unrealistic under current energy-market frameworks.

And then there are the hyperscalers themselves. Big tech companies with ambitious climate goals are signing power purchase agreements left and right for energy sources from geothermal to nuclear to hydropower. Google unveiled deals with two utilities this summer to dial down data centers’ power use during high demand. Texas-based developer Aligned Data Centers announced this fall that it would pay for a big battery alongside a computing facility it’s building in the Pacific Northwest, allowing the servers to get up and running way faster than if the company waited for traditional utility upgrades.

The problem has become even more acute at a time when the US president is openly hostile to the scientific consensus on climate change.
Why climate coverage is shrinking Still, Trump's return to office is not the only reason for a global dip in climate news coverage.
Climate coverage endures Despite the downturn, climate journalism has come a long way over the last few decades.
Back then, any story about climate change required both scientific voices and climate change deniers in the name of 'both-sidesism.'","Some 89% of people worldwide say they want more action on the climate crisis. Nearly seven in 10 note they would donate 1% of their income to help. In the US, two-thirds are at least somewhat worried about global warming.

And yet, Americans hear remarkably little about a crisis reshaping the global economy, displacing populations, worsening extreme weather, and affecting nearly every facet of daily life. More than half say they receive news about climate change several times a year or less, according to a 2025 Yale Program on Climate Change Communication report.

""If the media's not reporting the issue of climate change, it's out of sight and out of mind for people,"" said Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale program.

The problem has become even more acute at a time when the US president is openly hostile to the scientific consensus on climate change. Donald Trump and his allies have pushed misleading narratives about the trade-offs of green energy, drawing reporters into covering false controversies instead of facts and making the job of reporting harder.

""The Trump administration is playing reporters like a fiddle on the issue of trade-offs"" by bringing up red herrings and sending reporters down rabbit holes, Jael Holzman, a climate reporter at Heatmap News, told DW.

Trump administration spreading clean energy disinformation

Among President Trump's misleading claims is that offshore wind projects are ""driving the whales crazy"" and are the hidden cause of the marine mammals washing up dead.

Scientists, however, say there is no known link between the two, noting that vessel strikes and fishing-gear entanglements are the primary causes. Nonetheless, numerous stories still give airtime to unsubstantiated concerns from politicians and community groups, understandably worried about whales.

A similar dynamic emerged after the major fire at California's Moss Landing battery facility when Lee Zeldin, administrator of the EPA, the federal agency tasked with protecting the environment, visited Long Island to criticize New York's push for battery storage infrastructure.

But remarks by Trump-appointee Zeldin, and much of the subsequent reporting, omitted context that the incident likely stemmed from outdated technology, not representative of much of the country's newer battery-storage facilities.

""The impact of the Trump administration on the coverage is intentional,"" said Holzman, adding that tactics to delay progress on climate change have overtaken outright denialism.

""They don't need everyone to deny the existence of climate change — they just need enough people to deny the importance of dealing with it now.""

Scientific data missing, no longer updated

Beyond spreading misleading claims, the administration has made it harder for reporters to access the data needed to provide accurate context in the first place.

Holzman described how a government dashboard she used to track progress on environmental regulations mysteriously went dark for more than a month.

""There's just a lot of unexpected chicanery and shenanigans,"" she said.

The team behind climate.gov, a popular federal clearinghouse for climate information about weather, sea level and temperature rise, was fired this summer and users were redirected to a new site, which is no longer being updated. The previous team has since been attempting to relaunch the site.

The EPA has also erased references to human activity being the main driver of climate change, instead focusing on ""natural processes"" such as volcanic eruptions and variations in solar activity.

""Climate change has been scrubbed from government websites, they've taken down a number of major data sets, they are killing off programs at NASA that are devoted to climate change,"" said Leiserowitz at Yale, referencing the Orbiting Carbon Observatories, a pair of NASA missions that monitor greenhouse gas emissions, and which the administration wants to cancel.

""The US has been a major source of climate information, climate modeling, and so on, and that is having a chilling effect,"" he added.

Why climate coverage is shrinking

Still, Trump's return to office is not the only reason for a global dip in climate news coverage. It was on a steady-if-rocky incline throughout the 21st century before peaking in 2021 around the time the Biden administration was debating its landmark climate law.

But coverage fell precipitously the next year and has continued to slide downward, according to the Media and Climate Change Observatory, which monitors mentions of the issue in five major American newspapers, seven television stations, two radio networks and two wire services.

Several reasons are at play. Traditional media outlets have been in long-term decline over the last two decades, consistently losing money and readers. Since 2005, close to 3,500 local newspapers have vanished, according to a Northwestern University study.

Corporate consolidation and evaporating ad revenue have forced tighter budgets and repeated layoffs, squeezing coverage of complex beats like science and climate.

In 2023, CNBC laid off Cat Clifford, who helped found the network's climate desk and wrote that other layoffs had left it ""fundamentally dismantled"" with no dedicated staff covering the issue.

And even when the media does cover climate change, stories must navigate an algorithm-driven information ecosystem that filters news through partisan biases and amplifies disinformation before it ever reaches readers.

That ecosystem rewards Trump's stream of provocative statements — what reporters call a ""fire hose of attention"" strategy — frequently drowning out climate coverage.

Climate change is competing with ""news and entertainment and sports and your kid saying they want ice cream, and everything else going on in our lives that's demanding our attention,"" said Leiserowitz.

Climate coverage endures

Despite the downturn, climate journalism has come a long way over the last few decades.

Sadie Babits remembers the early years of climate journalism well. She filed her first environmental story in 2000 as an intern at Boise State Public Radio, reporting on Montana wildfires when the science linking extreme weather to human activity was still emerging. Back then, any story about climate change required both scientific voices and climate change deniers in the name of 'both-sidesism.'

Today, Babits is the senior supervising climate editor at NPR — a position that did not exist at the start of her career — joining legacy outlets like ​The New York Times, ​​The Washington Post and ​The Associated Press in building and maintaining dedicated climate desks. New niche outlets such as Holzman's ​Heatmap News, Canary Media, ​Latitude Media, ​​The Cool Down and more have sprouted up in the last five years.

""If people weren't interested in these topics, then I wouldn't have a job,"" Holzman said. ""I have readers so religiously interested in every word that I write that I have fans that come up to me in bars.""

Even in a year when Congress cut all federal support for NPR over accusations of liberal bias, Babits said the outlet has not changed its approach.

""We see this as a critical story of our time,"" she said. ""We have not backed down from the kind of work that we would be doing in any other year.""

At recent United Nations climate talks, South Korea’s new Ministry of Climate, Energy and Environment announced plans to retire most of the country’s coal-fired power plants by 2040 and to at least halve its carbon emissions by 2035.

Experts say this shows that South Korea, a major coal importer with one of the world’s largest fleets of coal plants, wants to speed up its renewable energy transition, which lags behind its neighbors and global averages.

But as part of trade deals with President Donald Trump, Seoul is raising imports of U.S. liquefied natural gas, or LNG. Climate activists contend such plans may conflict with the country’s pledges to help curb climate change and could lock South Korea into a fossil fuel-dependent future.

Talks are underway for South Korea to invest $350 billion in U.S. projects and purchase up to $100 billion worth of U.S. energy products, including LNG, a natural gas cooled to liquid form for easy storage and travel. It burns cleaner than coal, but still causes planet-warming emissions, especially of methane.

South Korea’s overall LNG imports may not increase if it offsets purchases of more U.S. natural gas by reducing imports from other sources such as Australia and the Middle East.

Still, it’s unclear how South Korea will “manage and consolidate all this somehow contradictory planning regarding its energy sector,” said Michelle Kim, an energy specialist for the U.S.-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

Power transition sparks

climate goals

South Korea’s liberal President Lee Jae Myung, who won a snap election in June, campaigned for stronger climate commitments. They had softened under his conservative predecessor Yoon Suk Yeol, who was ousted after a short-lived martial law declaration.

“As the global temperature rises, we all need to responsibly take climate action and Korea will have a stronger sense of responsibility in tackling the climate crisis,” Kim Sung-hwan, the inaugural Minister of Climate, Energy and Environment, said in an interview with The Associated Press.

South Korea’s goal to cut carbon emissions by 53% to 61% of its 2018 level, fell short of climate activists’ expectations. Business lobbies representing major manufacturers had proposed a 48% emissions reduction target.

“This range presents an effort by the government to accommodate two very different ways of thinking about the economic and climate future of the nation,” said Joojin Kim of the Seoul-based advocacy group, Solutions for Our Climate.

South Korea faces climate dilemma over U.S. deal

The South Korean government made the ambitious commitment to increase its clean energy use even after Trump’s sweeping ‘America First’ tariffs spurred energy negotiations between Seoul and Washington.

As part of its broader efforts to avoid higher tariffs, South Korea offered to import more LNG from the U.S., but the final trade deal has not been announced.

The agreement still under negotiation could last between three to 10 years, according to industry analysis and U.S. federal documents. Depending on the deal’s duration, South Korea may import between 3 million to 9 million tons of American LNG a year.

LNG made up almost a fifth of South Korea’s total energy supply last year, according to the International Energy Agency, or IEA. The government’s target was to cut that to 10.6% by 2038.

South Korea risks its climate goals if the pending trade deal increases the total volume of imported LNG, which will likely lead to an oversupply issue and the excess burning of gas to justify the deal, said Insung Lee, with Greenpeace in Seoul.

“If we just replace coal plants with LNG, that means the coal exit actually doesn’t lead to a green transition and merely shifts Korea’s addiction from coal to gas, which undermines the whole spirit of climate action,” Lee said.

South Korea’s energy mix

Renewable energy generated 7% of South Korea’s domestic power in 2022, according to the IEA. South Korean government data show that had increased to 10.5% last year, still one of the lowest levels among leading economies.

Japan, with an economy more than twice as big, generates 21% of its power from renewable sources. Spain, whose economy is about the same size as South Korea’s, gets 42% of its power from renewable sources.

Clean energy provided about 30% of global electricity production in 2023.

Nuclear power produces a major share of South Korea’s domestic energy, with government data showing that nuclear sources accounted for 31% of total electricity generation last year.

“We will transition into a new energy system that focuses on renewables and nuclear, while phasing out coal,” said Kim, the energy minister. He said South Korea will use LNG as a “complementary or emergency energy source” to make up for irregularities in renewable energy supplies.

In early December, South Korea set another goal of boosting its offshore wind power capacity to 4 gigawatts, about 10 times the current level.

South Korean companies that don’t cut back on carbon emissions may find that to be a competitive disadvantage, said Michelle Kim of the IEEFA.

Many global industries, including shipping and aviation, face pressure to reduce their emissions by providing incentives for low emitters and creating deterrents for high ones, she said.

“This is a lot of risk,” she said. “South Korea needs to speed up renewable energy deployment and come out from high dependency on the fossil fuel industry.”

Coal trade braces for South Korea cuts

At last month’s climate talks, South Korea joined the Powering Past Coal Alliance, a group of businesses, organizations and governments promoting the green energy transition.

That’s mainly a symbolic move, said Bruce Douglas, with the Global Renewables Alliance. “But it signifies very clear government intention to move away from fossil fuels and towards clean power.”

South Korea imports virtually all its coal, largely from Australia, Indonesia and Russia, and the switch to renewables is bound to impact regional markets.

The pledge to retire 40 of South Korea’s 61 coal sites by 2040 may be “an enforced transition” for coal exporters in the Asia-Pacific region, said James Bowen, with Climate Analytics. “It’s a reality that they’re going to have to face this downturn in the market.”

“The writing’s on the wall,” Bowen said. “One of the biggest importers in the world, one of the biggest customers, is starting to move away from coal.”

For the buyer T1 Energy, the strategic motivation focused on securing policy benefits and achieving rapid business transformation.","Trina Solar has officially completed the sale of its 5GW solar module manufacturing plant in Wilmer, Texas, US, to T1 Energy (formerly known as FREYR Battery). The transaction was initially announced in November 2024 and is expected to be fully completed by the end of December 2025, including the transfer of all equity and assets.

Through this transaction, T1 Energy has acquired domestic manufacturing capabilities in the US, making it eligible for the 45X Production Tax Credit under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Meanwhile, Trina Solar has repatriated funds through a ""light-asset"" model, mitigating geopolitical risks while retaining a minority stake (approximately 17.4%) in the company to maintain a strategic presence in the US market.

The 5GW module factory in Wilmer, Texas, serves as the strategic cornerstone for TrinaSolar to establish its core manufacturing capabilities in the US. Its development timeline is as follows:

According to the agreement signed at the end of 2024 and the final closing in 2025, the total transaction consideration was approximately $340 million (adjusted to about $380 million after certain adjustments), with the payment method being a combination of ""cash + debt notes + equity""：

1. Cash payment: $100 million.

2. Loan repayment: Repayment of intercompany loans of approximately $50 million.

3. Senior notes: Loan notes with a face value of $150 million.

4. Equity swap: Equity transfer conducted in two phases.

Phase 1 (end of 2024): TrinaSolar received $10 million in cash, $150 million in notes, and the first batch of T1 Energy ordinary shares (approximately 15.4 million shares).

Phase 2 (completed in December 2025): The remaining approximately 17.9 million ordinary shares were transferred.

Upon full completion of the transaction by December 2025, TrinaSolar held approximately 45.9 million shares of T1 Energy, representing a stake of about 17.4% (TrinaSolar's shareholding ratio was diluted from the initially projected 19% due to subsequent share issuance by T1 Energy).

For the seller Trina Solar, the core logic of this transaction lies in circumventing increasingly stringent trade barriers and optimizing its capital structure. In response to the escalating anti-dumping and countervailing duty investigations (AD/CVD) and tariff policies imposed by the US on Chinese PV enterprises, Trina Solar transferred assets to T1 Energy, which has European and American backgrounds. This move not only established the factory's products as ""Made in the USA"" to mitigate ownership risks but also successfully monetized the assets, recovering several hundred million US dollars in cash to significantly improve its balance sheet. More importantly, Trina Solar did not exit entirely; instead, by holding equity in T1 Energy and appointing executives such as Mingxing Lin and Dave Gustafson to T1's board and management, it maintained deep involvement and strategic influence in the US market.

For the buyer T1 Energy, the strategic motivation focused on securing policy benefits and achieving rapid business transformation. The primary driver of this acquisition was obtaining production tax credits under Section 45X of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which provides direct and substantial cash flow support. By taking over this operational high-quality asset, T1 Energy successfully overcame previous challenges in cell manufacturing, such as those faced in the Norwegian Giga Arctic project, transforming from a revenue-less cell startup into a solar manufacturer with positive cash flow. Furthermore, this factory (G1) will serve as a cornerstone, facilitating the construction of the Austin cell plant (G2) and helping T1 Energy build a complete, vertically integrated PV supply chain in the US, encompassing both modules and cells.",https://static.metal.com/common.metal.com/images/header-en/smm-logo.png,N,,2025-12-29 11:00:37.924163

U.S. Senator

Washington, D.C. – On September 19th, 1942, U.S. Army General Leslie Groves made a decision that would change the course of history. He approved the federal government’s acquisition of nearly 60,000 acres along East Tennessee’s Clinch River, establishing the central hub of the Manhattan Project.

At the site—soon known as Oak Ridge—tens of thousands of Americans worked together to pioneer uranium enrichment and plutonium production, ensuring America’s victory in the nuclear race against the Axis Powers.

Eighty-three years later, that extraordinary legacy lives on. Each day, scientists at Oak Ridge National Laboratory conduct cutting-edge nuclear research, including at the Y-12 National Security Complex, one of the original Manhattan Project facilities. More than 220 nuclear companies call Tennessee home, including 150 in the Oak Ridge area alone. Universities from Tennessee Tech to the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, lead the nation in nuclear engineering, educating the future leaders of this vital field.

As President Donald J. Trump works to usher in a “nuclear renaissance” to power 21st-century America—with the aim of quadrupling our nuclear capacity by 2050—no state is better prepared to lead than Tennessee. That leadership will prove vital to our nation’s security, safety, and prosperity.

The advantages of nuclear power are clear. Over the long term, it is the most reliable source of base load electricity, especially as emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and quantum computing require more and more energy. Nuclear plants operate 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, with remarkable efficiency. To produce the same amount of energy, solar power requires roughly 400 times as much land as nuclear, while wind requires 2,000 times as much land. Nuclear energy is also resilient, operating through natural disasters when reliable power can mean the difference between life and death.

For far too long, however, government red tape has made nuclear development unnecessarily difficult. Since the turn of the century, America has brought just three new nuclear reactors online. Over the same period, Communist China has constructed more than 50.

To make certain that the 21st century is an American century, the United States must lead in nuclear energy. That’s why, earlier this year, President Trump signed executive orders to support the industry, including to speed up approvals for new reactors and to strengthen domestic fuel supply chains.

To seize this opportunity, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) must lead the way. President Trump has taken decisive action to put the nation’s largest public utility on the right track, including last week’s Senate confirmation of four of his nominees to the TVA Board of Directors, where they will help guide the utility’s efforts to expand nuclear energy generation.

Central to this effort will be the TVA’s development of small modular realtors, or SMRs. While building traditional reactors can be expensive and time-consuming, SMRs offer a more flexible and affordable alternative. According to one estimate, SMRs can halve the costs associated with building and operating a large nuclear plant.

Tennessee is uniquely positioned to lead this effort. The Clinch River Site is one of the only federally approved locations in the country for SMR development. Earlier this month, the U.S. Department of Energy awarded TVA a $400 million grant to advance the project. In addition, as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill, I was pleased to secure a tax benefit for certain advanced nuclear facility projects—support that will directly benefit the Clinch River Site.

Eight decades ago, Tennessee helped America win the first nuclear race. With new challenges and opportunities before us, our state must once again rise to the moment—ensuring that America remains the global leader in nuclear energy and securing our freedom, safety, and sovereignty for generations to come.",https://www.clarksvilleonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Marsha-Blackburn-2.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 01:13:16.372615

The two groups are expected soon to publish their final figures for 2025, and based on sales data so far this year, there is almost no chance the American company led by Elon Musk will retain its leadership position.

At the end of November, Shenzhen-based BYD, which also produces hybrid vehicles, had sold 2.07 million EVs so far in 2025.

Tesla, for its part, had sold 1.22 million by the end of September.

Tesla's September figures included a one-time boost in sales, to nearly half-a-million vehicles in a three-month period, before the expiration of a US tax credit for buyers of electric vehicles -- which ended under legislation backed by President Donald Trump, a climate change skeptic.

But Tesla's sales in the coming quarter are expected to fall to 449,000, according to a FactSet analysis consensus. That would give Tesla about 1.65 million sales for all of 2025, a drop of 7.7 percent and well below the level BYD had attained by end November.

Deutsche Bank, which projects just 405,000 Tesla EV sales during the fourth quarter, sees the company's sales down by around one-third in both North America and Europe, and by one-tenth in China.

- Transition period -

Industry watchers say it will take time for EV demand to reach a level of equilibrium in the United States following the elimination of the $7,500 US tax credit at the end of September 2025.

Even prior to that, Tesla had seen sales struggle in key markets over CEO Musk's political support of Trump and other far-right politicians. Tesla has also faced rising EV competition from BYD and other Chinese companies and from European giants.

""We believe Tesla will see some weakness on deliveries"" in the fourth quarter, said Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities.

Sales of 420,000 would be ""good enough to show stable demand,"" with Wall Street ""laser focused on the autonomous chapter kicking off in 2026,"" Ives added, referring to plans for self-driving vehicles.

Even as it has grown quickly, BYD has faced challenges in its home market.

With profitability in China weighed down by price-wary consumers, the company has sought to strengthen its foothold in foreign markets.

BYD is ""one of the pioneers to establish overseas production capacity and supply chains for EVs,"" Jing Yang, Director of Asia-Pacific Corporate Ratings at Fitch Ratings, told AFP.

""Going forward, its geographical diversification is likely to help it to navigate an increasingly complicated global tariff environment,"" said Yang.

Overseas rivals to BYD have balked at Chinese state subsidies and other state supports that have allowed the company to sell vehicles cheaply.

Trump's predecessor Joe Biden imposed 100 percent tariffs on Chinese EV imports that could potentially go even higher under Trump. Europe has also imposed tariffs on Chinese imports, but BYD is building manufacturing capacity in Hungary.

While the chance of Tesla reclaiming its global leadership in EVs looks uncertain, the American company is also potentially positioned for growth.

Michaeli of TD Cowen sees autonomous technology playing an increasingly important role for Tesla, with breakthroughs in its ""full self-driving"" or ""FSD"" offerings potentially boosting sales.

""As Tesla really begins to roll out eyes-off features and expand FSDs capability, if they do that successfully, that should generate more demand for their vehicles,"" Michaeli said.

Musk has said the Cybercab, an autonomous robotaxi model, will begin production in April 2026. The company has also unveiled lower-priced versions of the Models 3 and Y that could boost sales.

Double production capacity

For over 40 years, Hitachi Energy’s Landskrona factory has manufactured and supplied advanced cooling systems for power transmission. These systems range from large HVDC converters to vehicle charging infrastructure, where deionized water safely removes heat during conversion between direct and alternating current.

Driven by the global shift toward electrification and the rising demand for transmission solutions, boosting cooling system manufacturing capacity has become essential. Earlier this month, Hitachi Energy announced a major expansion of its cooling systems factory in Landskrona, Sweden. To secure future operations, the company is acquiring the industrial property Björnen 12, which will become the central hub for its ongoing investment and development.

Investing approximately $77 million USD, the new facility enables Hitachi Energy to consolidate its current production and office spaces under one roof. Owning and developing the facility not only provides cost-effectiveness, and flexibility but also supports continued expansion in line with the business’s growth.

The electrical grid relies on cooling systems to maintain optimal operating temperatures. They are designed to extend equipment life, prevent damage, mitigate safety risks, and reduce inefficiency and load loss. As a leader in cooling system technology, Hitachi Energy’s portfolio serves a wide range of segments, including T&D facilities, renewables, energy storage, E-mobility, and much more.

Dr. Habre’s opinion (and, to a lesser extent, Dr. Mabe’s) credibly linked coal dust exposure to the disabling impairment.
As American Energy notes, in such cases, proof of legal pneumoconiosis may essentially resolve the causation element: the same disease (COPD/emphysema) both qualifies as legal pneumoconiosis and causes the disabling respiratory limitations.","I. Introduction

This unpublished Fourth Circuit decision, Clinchfield Coal Company v. Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs & Johnny L. Wallace, No. 24‑1875 (4th Cir. Dec. 23, 2025), arises under the Black Lung Benefits Act (BLBA), 30 U.S.C. §§ 901–944. The case concerns a miner, Johnny Wallace, who filed a subsequent claim for federal black lung benefits after his initial claim was denied. An Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) awarded benefits; the Benefits Review Board (BRB or Board) affirmed; and Clinchfield Coal Company petitioned the Fourth Circuit for review.

Although unpublished and therefore not binding precedent in the Fourth Circuit, this opinion is a detailed application of recent BLBA case law, especially Island Creek Coal Co. v. Blankenship, 123 F.4th 684 (4th Cir. 2024), American Energy, LLC v. Director, OWCP, 106 F.4th 319 (4th Cir. 2024), and Extra Energy, Inc. v. Lawson, 140 F.4th 138 (4th Cir. 2025). It reinforces several important principles:

The strong deference owed to an ALJ’s weighing of conflicting medical evidence in black lung claims, particularly in ""battle of the experts"" situations involving both coal dust exposure and long-term smoking.

The permissibility and scope of using the Department of Labor’s Preamble to the black lung regulations as scientific context when assessing medical opinions.

The doctrine of abandonment of issues based on inadequate briefing in the court of appeals and failure to raise arguments before the BRB.

How proof of legal pneumoconiosis can effectively satisfy multiple elements of entitlement, including disease, disease arising out of coal mine employment, and disability causation.

The Fourth Circuit ultimately denied Clinchfield’s petition for review, leaving intact the award of black lung benefits to Wallace.

II. Summary of the Opinion

The court’s disposition and principal holdings can be summarized as follows:

The Fourth Circuit reviews the BRB’s legal conclusions de novo but defers to the ALJ’s factual findings if supported by substantial evidence, consistent with Island Creek.

Under Fed. R. App. P. 28(a)(8)(A), Clinchfield abandoned its challenge to the ALJ’s finding of total disability by offering only a bare, conclusory assertion without developed argument or record citations.

Clinchfield likewise abandoned any challenge to the ALJ’s credibility findings regarding its own experts (Drs. Sargent and McSharry) by not properly raising that challenge before the BRB.

The ALJ’s finding that Wallace suffers from legal pneumoconiosis (COPD/emphysema/chronic bronchitis significantly related to coal dust exposure) is supported by substantial evidence, particularly the opinion of Dr. Habre, which was based on corrected and accurate coal mine and smoking histories.

The ALJ permissibly gave reduced weight to Dr. Mabe’s opinion because it relied on inaccurate exposure and smoking histories, and permissibly rejected key aspects of Drs. Sargent’s and McSharry’s opinions because they dismissed a valid, qualifying pulmonary function test (PFT) and over-relied on negative x-rays.

The ALJ properly relied on the regulatory Preamble as one factor in evaluating Dr. McSharry’s failure to address the additive effects of coal dust and smoking, consistent with American Energy and Extra Energy; the ALJ did not shift the burden of proof to Clinchfield.

Because ""legal pneumoconiosis"" by definition ""arises out of coal mine employment,"" establishing legal pneumoconiosis satisfied both the first (existence of pneumoconiosis) and second (arising out of coal mine employment) entitlement elements.

The ALJ’s finding that Wallace’s pneumoconiosis was a substantially contributing cause of his total disability is supported by substantial evidence, especially in light of American Energy and Toler v. Eastern Assoc. Coal Co., 43 F.3d 109 (4th Cir. 1995).

Because the BRB affirmed based on legal pneumoconiosis alone and did not rely on the ALJ’s clinical pneumoconiosis finding, the Fourth Circuit did not address Clinchfield’s x‑ray-based arguments; its review is limited to the grounds used by the BRB (Extra Energy).

III. Detailed Analysis

A. Factual and Procedural Background

Johnny Wallace originally filed a black lung claim in 2010. That claim was denied because he failed to prove:

that he had pneumoconiosis,

that he was totally disabled by a pulmonary or respiratory impairment, and

that any pneumoconiosis was caused by his coal mine work.

In July 2019, Wallace filed a subsequent claim. Under 20 C.F.R. § 725.309(c), a subsequent claim can be considered only if the miner proves a ""change in an applicable condition of entitlement""—meaning that at least one element of entitlement that was previously decided against the claimant is now proven. Here, Wallace’s later success in establishing total disability satisfied this threshold.

The ALJ made several key factual findings:

Wallace had 13.44 years of qualifying coal mine employment.

His usual coal mine work (roof bolter doing ""face work"" underground) required medium to heavy exertion and involved substantial coal dust exposure.

He had a smoking history of at least 30 pack‑years and was still smoking about one‑quarter pack per day.

The medical evidence came from four physicians:

Dr. Donovan Mabe (DOL-sponsored exam, Dec. 2019): diagnosed both clinical and legal pneumoconiosis; found total disability from pulmonary/respiratory impairment; attributed disability substantially to coal dust exposure.

Dr. Antoine Habre (claimant’s expert, two exams in Dec. 2021): likewise diagnosed clinical and legal pneumoconiosis; found total disability; and opined that coal dust exposure substantially contributed to the impairment, particularly by worsening emphysema and chronic bronchitis.

Dr. Jeffrey Sargent (employer’s expert, May 2020) and Dr. Roger McSharry (employer’s expert, Oct. 2021): both concluded that Wallace did not have clinical or legal pneumoconiosis, was not totally disabled by any significant pulmonary impairment, and that any impairment was attributable solely to cigarette smoking.

After hearing and weighing this evidence, the ALJ:

Found a valid and qualifying PFT (Dec. 14, 2021) supporting total respiratory disability.

Credited Drs. Habre and, to a lesser extent, Mabe on the existence of legal pneumoconiosis and causation.

Discounted key aspects of Drs. Sargent’s and McSharry’s opinions, particularly their rejection of the qualifying PFT and their failure to adequately consider coal dust as a causal or aggravating factor.

Found that Wallace had both clinical and legal pneumoconiosis and was totally disabled, with pneumoconiosis substantially contributing to that disability.

The BRB affirmed the ALJ’s findings on:

total disability,

legal pneumoconiosis, and

disability causation as to legal pneumoconiosis.

Crucially, the BRB did not reach or rely on the ALJ’s finding of clinical pneumoconiosis. Clinchfield then petitioned the Fourth Circuit for review.

B. Standard of Review and Administrative Law Framework

The court applied the standard articulated in Island Creek Coal Co. v. Blankenship, 123 F.4th 684 (4th Cir. 2024):

It reviews the BRB’s legal conclusions de novo.

It defers to the ALJ’s factual findings if supported by substantial evidence—that is, ""more than a mere scintilla"" and ""such relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.""

The court also stressed that the ALJ must:

analyze all relevant evidence; and

adequately explain the rationale for crediting or discrediting evidence.

At the same time, consistent with Island Creek, the ALJ’s ""duty of explanation is not intended to be a mandate for administrative verbosity."" The explanation is adequate if the reviewing court can understand what the ALJ did and why.

This framework is critical: it underscores that appellate courts, especially in BLBA cases, are not fact-finders. Their role is to ensure that the ALJ’s decision is both legally correct and supported by substantial evidence—not to re‑weigh competing medical opinions.

C. Precedents and Authorities Cited

The opinion relies heavily on the following authorities:

Island Creek Coal Co. v. Blankenship, 123 F.4th 684 (4th Cir. 2024)

Provides the standard of review in black lung appeals, emphasizing substantial evidence review of ALJ fact‑finding and the sufficiency of a clear, but not excessively verbose, explanation of reasoning.

Extra Energy, Inc. v. Lawson, 140 F.4th 138 (4th Cir. 2025)

Discusses the BLBA’s purpose (""to provide benefits to coal miners who are totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis""); elaborates on review of causation in the presence of smoking; underscores that appellate courts must not substitute their judgment for the ALJ’s in ""battle of the experts"" situations; and clarifies the permissible use of the Preamble to the black lung regulations.

Also important for the principle that the Fourth Circuit’s review is limited to the grounds relied upon by the BRB.

American Energy, LLC v. Director, OWCP, 106 F.4th 319 (4th Cir. 2024)

Sets out the four elements a miner must prove by a preponderance of the evidence:

Existence of pneumoconiosis (clinical or legal);

That the pneumoconiosis arose out of coal mine employment;

Total disability due to a pulmonary or respiratory impairment; and

Pneumoconiosis is a substantially contributing cause of total disability.

It also explains:

The distinction between clinical and legal pneumoconiosis;

The inclusion of COPD (chronic bronchitis, emphysema, asthma) in ""legal"" pneumoconiosis;

That once ""legal pneumoconiosis"" is shown, the ""arising out of coal mine employment"" element is automatically satisfied; and

That in some cases, establishing legal pneumoconiosis may effectively satisfy the causation element as well when the same condition causes the disability.

Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, 178 F.3d 231 (4th Cir. 1999)

Interprets Fed. R. App. P. 28(a)(8)(A) and holds that failure to develop an argument with reasons and supporting citations in an opening brief results in abandonment of that claim on appeal.

Toler v. Eastern Assoc. Coal Co., 43 F.3d 109 (4th Cir. 1995)

Holds that once an ALJ has found that a claimant has pneumoconiosis and is totally disabled, the ALJ generally may not credit a doctor’s opinion that pneumoconiosis did not cause the disability if that opinion rests on the premise that the miner does not have pneumoconiosis or is not disabled. To credit such an opinion, the ALJ must find ""specific and persuasive reasons"" showing the doctor’s causation analysis is independent of those erroneous premises.

Regulatory provisions

20 C.F.R. § 725.309(c): Defines what constitutes a ""change in an applicable condition of entitlement"" for subsequent claims.

20 C.F.R. § 718.201(a)(2), (b), (c): Defines ""legal pneumoconiosis"" as any chronic lung disease or impairment ""significantly related to, or substantially aggravated by,"" coal dust exposure, and recognizes pneumoconiosis as a latent and progressive disease that may first become detectable after coal dust exposure ceases.

20 C.F.R. § 718.204(b)(1)–(2), (c)(1): Defines ""total disability"" and sets out methods of proof (including qualifying PFTs and medical opinions) and when pneumoconiosis is a ""substantially contributing cause"" of disability.

Preamble to the Regulations Implementing the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, 65 Fed. Reg. 79920, 79941 (Dec. 20, 2000)

The Preamble summarizes the medical and scientific evidence underlying the regulations, including:

That coal dust exposure can cause COPD, even in the absence of radiographic evidence of clinical pneumoconiosis.

That the effects of coal dust and cigarette smoking on lung function are often additive or synergistic.

Fourth Circuit precedent permits ALJs to consult the Preamble as scientific context when evaluating medical opinions.

D. The Court’s Legal Reasoning

1. Total Disability: Abandonment Through Inadequate Briefing

The ALJ found total disability based on:

A valid, qualifying PFT performed on December 14, 2021 during Dr. Habre’s evaluation; and

Medical opinion evidence (Drs. Mabe and Habre) concluding Wallace could not perform his usual coal mine work or similar employment given his respiratory limitations.

Under 20 C.F.R. § 718.204(b)(2)(i)-(iv), total disability can be established through:

Qualifying PFTs,

Qualifying arterial blood gas studies,

Evidence of cor pulmonale with right‑sided congestive heart failure, or

Reasoned medical opinions.

Both Drs. Sargent and McSharry acknowledged that the Dec. 14, 2021 PFT was numerically ""qualifying"" but insisted it was invalid due to poor effort and that Wallace’s lung function was ""normal or close to normal."" The ALJ rejected that characterization and credited Dr. Habre’s view that the PFT was valid.

On appeal, Clinchfield offered only ""a single, conclusory statement"" that the ALJ’s total disability finding was erroneous, without any supporting argument. Citing Fed. R. App. P. 28(a)(8)(A) and Edwards, the court held that this failure to provide developed argument triggered abandonment:

""Failure to comply with the specific dictates of this rule with respect to a particular claim triggers abandonment of that claim on appeal.""

Thus, the total disability finding became effectively unchallenged and binding for purposes of the court’s review. This is significant: employers (and claimants) must fully brief any issue they wish to preserve.

2. Legal vs. Clinical Pneumoconiosis and Mixed Etiology

The court restated the distinction between:

Clinical pneumoconiosis: recognized medical conditions such as coal workers’ pneumoconiosis, usually shown by x‑ray or pathology, involving the deposition of coal dust particles and fibrotic reaction in the lungs.

Legal pneumoconiosis: a broader regulatory category that covers any chronic lung disease or impairment and its sequela ""significantly related to, or substantially aggravated by"" coal dust exposure. This expressly includes COPD, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and asthma.

Critically:

Coal dust need not be the exclusive cause of the impairment.

A miner may have a long and substantial smoking history and still establish legal pneumoconiosis if coal dust exposure is a significant contributor or aggravator of the disease.

It can be difficult—even for experts—to precisely differentiate between the effects of smoking and the effects of coal dust, but that difficulty does not defeat a legal pneumoconiosis finding.

The Fourth Circuit emphasized (following Extra Energy) that this area of law has generated repeated litigation, but the court has ""never deviated"" from its standard of review: the ALJ is the one who resolves the ""battle of the experts."" The appellate court defers to the ALJ’s weight-of-the-evidence determinations if properly reasoned and supported.

3. Crediting the Claimant’s Expert (Dr. Habre) on Legal Pneumoconiosis

Clinchfield’s principal attack on the legal pneumoconiosis finding was that the ALJ allegedly failed to recognize that Drs. Mabe and Habre used:

an overstated coal mine employment history, and

a minimized smoking history.

The court rejected this characterization. It carefully tracked the ALJ’s handling of each physician:

Dr. Mabe:

Believed Wallace had 16 years of coal mine work and only 5 pack‑years of smoking, both inaccurate.

The ALJ recognized this error and gave his opinions reduced weight on that basis.

Importantly, the ALJ did not rely primarily on Mabe’s opinion to establish legal pneumoconiosis.

Dr. Habre:

Initially recorded 16 years of coal mine employment and no smoking history in early reports, but was ""always aware"" of ongoing smoking based on arterial blood gas (ABG) findings.

Before rendering his final opinions, he was explicitly informed that:

the agency had calculated 13 years of qualifying coal mine employment; and

Wallace had a smoking history exceeding 30 pack‑years.

Dr. Habre then adjusted his analysis and expressly acknowledged both:

the significant smoking history; and

substantial coal dust exposure, including intensive ""face"" work as a roof bolter with high dust levels.

He diagnosed emphysema and chronic bronchitis, recognized smoking as a contributor, but concluded that coal dust exposure played a substantial role in the decline of lung function and the disabling impairment.

He reasoned that coal dust worsened Wallace’s emphysema and aggravated his symptoms, in line with the known synergistic impact of coal dust and smoking.

He grounded his conclusions in:

accurate occupational and smoking histories,

chest x‑ray findings,

PFT results (including the qualifying 2021 PFT),

chronic bronchitis and clinical symptom profile, and

accepted medical understanding of combined exposures.

On that basis, the ALJ gave probative and dispositive weight to Dr. Habre’s final, corrected opinion and found that Wallace established legal pneumoconiosis. The Fourth Circuit held that this reasoning was both:

accurately grounded in the record; and

adequately explained.

Thus, the court affirmed the ALJ’s choice to rely on Dr. Habre over Clinchfield’s experts regarding the existence of legal pneumoconiosis.

4. Discounting Employer’s Experts and the Role of the Preamble

Clinchfield argued the ALJ improperly discredited Drs. Sargent and McSharry and shifted the burden of proof to the employer to disprove legal pneumoconiosis.

Procedural abandonment at the BRB stage. The court first noted a procedural bar:

Clinchfield did not directly challenge the ALJ’s reasons for discrediting these experts before the BRB.

The BRB therefore affirmed the ALJ’s credibility findings on that basis.

On appeal, Clinchfield did not contend that it had properly raised this issue to the BRB or that the BRB erred in its approach.

Consequently, any challenge to the ALJ’s weighing of these experts was abandoned.

Substantive review (even if preserved). The court went on to hold that even if the issue were preserved, the ALJ’s treatment of employer’s experts was legally proper:

Drs. Sargent and McSharry:

Concluded Wallace had no significant pulmonary impairment and no legal pneumoconiosis;

Based this in part on their belief that there were no valid PFTs or ABGs showing significant lung disease;

Dismissed the Dec. 14, 2021 PFT as invalid, contrary to the ALJ’s now unchallenged finding that it was both valid and qualifying for total disability purposes;

Relied, at least partly, on the absence of positive x‑ray evidence; but negative x‑rays cannot rule out legal pneumoconiosis because legal pneumoconiosis does not depend on radiographic findings.

The ALJ’s decision to give limited weight to opinions that:

contradicted the ALJ’s own well-supported finding of a valid, qualifying PFT; and

placed undue weight on x‑rays in the context of legal pneumoconiosis

was fully consistent with substantial-evidence review and prior case law.

Use of the Preamble. Clinchfield further argued that the ALJ improperly relied on the Preamble, particularly in criticizing Dr. McSharry for not addressing whether coal dust played any role in Wallace’s pulmonary impairment.

The Fourth Circuit reaffirmed its holdings in American Energy and Extra Energy:

ALJs are permitted to consult the Preamble when evaluating the credibility of medical opinions on both:

the existence of pneumoconiosis; and

the cause of the miner’s disabling impairment.

ALJs may note ""tensions"" or inconsistencies between a physician’s reasoning and the medical-scientific principles reflected in the Preamble.

However, they may not mechanically discredit an opinion solely because it conflicts with the Preamble without proper explanation.

The court found that the ALJ’s use of the Preamble here was proper:

The ALJ did not discredit Dr. McSharry solely because he failed to consider coal dust or because his conclusions conflicted with the Preamble.

Instead, the ALJ:

identified several independent reasons for discounting his opinion (rejection of the valid PFT, overreliance on x‑rays, etc.); and

used the Preamble only as one additional factor to highlight his failure to consider the additive effects of coal dust and smoking.

Consistent with Extra Energy, this context-sensitive use of the Preamble was entirely permissible.

The court also rejected Clinchfield’s argument that the ALJ erred in crediting Habre over its experts based on the time gap between Wallace’s coal mine employment and the first abnormal PFT. Citing 20 C.F.R. § 718.201(c), the court reminded that pneumoconiosis is a latent and progressive disease and may become detectable only after coal dust exposure has ceased. The ALJ was entitled to prefer the experts who accepted this premise over those who did not.

5. Satisfying Multiple Elements Through Legal Pneumoconiosis

The Fourth Circuit underscored a doctrinally important point drawn from American Energy:

Once a miner proves legal pneumoconiosis—i.e., that his chronic lung disease is significantly related to or substantially aggravated by coal dust exposure—he automatically satisfies the requirement that the disease arose out of coal mine employment.

As the court put it:

""A miner who satisfies the first element of his claim by establishing legal pneumoconiosis necessarily satisfies [the] second element [because,] by definition, legal pneumoconiosis arises out of coal mine employment.""

Moreover, in some circumstances, such as where COPD itself both constitutes legal pneumoconiosis and is the cause of total disability, establishing legal pneumoconiosis may effectively satisfy the causation element as well.

6. Disability Causation and the Toler Constraint

The final element Wallace had to prove was that pneumoconiosis was a ""substantially contributing cause"" of his total disability, under 20 C.F.R. § 718.204(c)(1). This is satisfied if pneumoconiosis either:

has a material adverse effect on the miner’s respiratory or pulmonary condition; or

materially worsens a totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary impairment caused by another condition (e.g., smoking).

The ALJ found:

Wallace’s total disability resulted from COPD and emphysema.

Those conditions were made significantly worse by coal dust exposure—i.e., they constituted legal pneumoconiosis.

Dr. Habre’s opinion (and, to a lesser extent, Dr. Mabe’s) credibly linked coal dust exposure to the disabling impairment.

This reasoning ""dovetailed"" with the earlier legal pneumoconiosis finding. As American Energy notes, in such cases, proof of legal pneumoconiosis may essentially resolve the causation element: the same disease (COPD/emphysema) both qualifies as legal pneumoconiosis and causes the disabling respiratory limitations.

The ALJ then applied Toler:

Drs. Sargent and McSharry opined that pneumoconiosis played no role in Wallace’s disability—but their opinions were premised on the absence of legal pneumoconiosis and, in effect, on the absence of any significant pulmonary impairment.

Having found that Wallace does have legal pneumoconiosis and is totally disabled, the ALJ could credit those causation opinions only if she found ""specific and persuasive reasons"" showing that their no‑causation views did not rest on those erroneous premises.

The ALJ found no such reasons; instead, the record suggested that their causation analysis was inextricably tied to their rejection of pneumoconiosis itself.

The Fourth Circuit agreed that the ALJ properly applied Toler and that her causation finding was supported by substantial evidence.

7. Limited Scope of Review: Legal vs. Clinical Pneumoconiosis

Clinchfield also attempted to attack the ALJ’s finding that x‑rays showed simple (clinical) pneumoconiosis. However:

The BRB did not rely on that clinical pneumoconiosis finding; it affirmed solely on the basis of legal pneumoconiosis and its contribution to disability.

Under Extra Energy, the Fourth Circuit’s review is limited to the grounds actually relied upon by the BRB.

Therefore, the court declined to reach the clinical pneumoconiosis/x‑ray issue and found no reason to remand. The Board’s decision, grounded in legal pneumoconiosis and causation, was adequately supported by the ALJ’s record-based findings.

E. Impact and Practical Implications

1. For Claimants

This decision reinforces that miners with mixed etiologies (smoking plus coal dust) can still prevail if they show coal dust significantly contributed to or aggravated COPD/emphysema.

Independent medical opinions that:

use accurate exposure and smoking histories,

engage all objective testing (including PFTs and ABGs), and

explicitly address additive effects of coal dust and smoking

will carry significant weight with ALJs and withstand appellate review.

The decision shows that a prior denial is not the end: a miner who later demonstrates total disability can meet the ""change in an applicable condition of entitlement"" standard for a subsequent claim.

2. For Employers and Insurers

Experts must be prepared to:

engage with the Preamble’s medical principles (especially coal dust–related COPD and additive effects with smoking); and

offer a reasoned, scientifically grounded explanation when attributing disease solely to smoking in a miner with substantial coal dust exposure.

Attempts to discredit PFTs as invalid must be robustly supported; if the ALJ finds the test valid and qualifying, opinions premised on ""no valid PFT"" will be vulnerable to being discounted.

It is crucial to preserve issues:

Arguments not properly raised before the BRB may be treated as waived in the court of appeals.

Arguments that are presented in only skeletal form in the Fourth Circuit brief will be deemed abandoned.

3. For ALJs and the BRB

The case validates ALJs’ use of the Preamble as scientific guidance, provided they:

do not rely on it mechanistically; and

explain how tensions between a physician’s reasoning and the Preamble bear on credibility.

It confirms that ALJs may:

discount medical opinions based on inaccurate coal mine and smoking histories; but

credit opinions where the physician corrects those histories and updates their conclusions accordingly.

ALJs are reminded to:

give clear, organized explanations of why certain medical opinions are credited or discredited;

explicitly tie factual findings (e.g., validity of tests, years of exposure, smoking history) to their evaluation of expert opinions.

The BRB’s practice of declining to review arguments that were not adequately raised below is reinforced, as is the principle that appellate review is limited to the grounds on which the BRB relied.

F. Clarifying Key Legal and Medical Concepts

1. Clinical vs. Legal Pneumoconiosis

Clinical pneumoconiosis:

The traditional medical disease recognized as coal workers’ pneumoconiosis.

Usually diagnosed via chest x‑ray or pathology showing coal dust particles and fibrotic nodules.

Legal pneumoconiosis:

A regulatory concept encompassing any chronic lung disease or impairment ""significantly related to, or substantially aggravated by"" coal dust exposure.

Includes chronic bronchitis, emphysema, COPD, asthma, etc., when linked to coal dust.

Does not require x‑ray or pathological proof of classic ""coal workers’ pneumoconiosis.""

2. Substantial Evidence

""Substantial evidence"" is:

More than a ""mere scintilla"" of evidence; and

That which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion—even if another decision-maker might weigh the evidence differently.

This standard gives substantial deference to the ALJ’s factual findings, especially in technical, expert-heavy cases like BLBA claims.

3. Abandonment of Issues on Appeal

Under Fed. R. App. P. 28(a)(8)(A), an appellant’s brief must include:

contentions,

reasons, and

citations to authorities and parts of the record.

Failure to develop an argument with reasoning and support—such as offering only a conclusory sentence—results in abandonment of that issue in the appellate court.

Similarly, issues not raised (or insufficiently raised) before the BRB cannot ordinarily be raised for the first time in the court of appeals.

4. Qualifying Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs)

Under the BLBA regulations, PFT results are compared to regulatory tables that set threshold values (based on age, height, sex) to determine whether the test is ""qualifying"" for total disability. A test is:

Qualifying if the FEV1 and other relevant measures meet or fall below the table values, indicating significant impairment.

Valid if it meets technical and procedural quality standards (proper effort, cooperation, reproducibility, etc.).

An ALJ may accept one physician’s assessment of validity over another’s, provided the choice is reasoned and explained.

5. Latent and Progressive Nature of Pneumoconiosis

20 C.F.R. § 718.201(c) recognizes that pneumoconiosis:

may be latent (not clinically evident immediately); and

may be progressive (worsening over time),

such that it may first become detectable only after coal dust exposure has ended. Thus, a significant lapse of time between cessation of coal mine work and observed pulmonary impairment does not, by itself, refute pneumoconiosis.

6. ""Substantially Contributing Cause"" in BLBA Causation

Pneumoconiosis substantially contributes to disability if it:

has a material adverse effect on the respiratory condition; or

materially worsens an existing totally disabling impairment from other causes (like smoking).

This is a less demanding standard than sole causation or ""but-for"" causation. Coal dust need not be the only cause, but it must be a real, significant contributing factor.

IV. Conclusion

Clinchfield Coal Co. v. DOWCP (Wallace) does not break new doctrinal ground, but it powerfully illustrates how the Fourth Circuit’s recent BLBA jurisprudence operates in practice. It:

Reinforces that ALJs are the primary arbiters of complex expert evidence in black lung cases, and that their findings will be upheld if supported by substantial evidence and adequately explained.

Confirms the legitimacy of using the regulatory Preamble as scientific context when evaluating medical opinions, particularly on the interplay between coal dust and smoking.

Highlights the importance of accurate exposure and smoking histories in medical opinions, and validates ALJs’ decisions to discount opinions rooted in serious factual errors.

Shows how establishing legal pneumoconiosis (especially COPD/emphysema tied to coal dust) can simultaneously satisfy multiple elements of BLBA entitlement, including origin and causation.

Emphasizes strict enforcement of procedural rules on issue preservation and briefing: undeveloped arguments in the court of appeals and issues not adequately raised before the BRB will be treated as abandoned or waived.

In combination with Island Creek, American Energy, and Extra Energy, this case further consolidates a coherent, claimant-accessible framework for adjudicating black lung claims in the Fourth Circuit, particularly where coal dust exposure and heavy smoking coexist. Although unpublished, it will likely serve as a persuasive example for future litigants and adjudicators navigating similar battles over medical causation and the weight of expert testimony under the Black Lung Benefits Act.",https://www.casemine.com/images/casemine-share.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 11:13:10.737709

""Tesla has a serious challenge on its hands next year when several other automakers are planning to roll out cheaper vehicles that are also full of fun features,"" she told the news outlet.
Why is Tesla's sales slump important?
Plummeting sales could hamper resale values for current Tesla owners, with oversupply and weakening demand usually depressing used car prices.","Tesla's U.S. sales dropped to a near four-year low in November, a troubling trend for the electric vehicle maker despite the launch of cheaper versions of its popular models.

What's happening?

Tesla sold 39,800 vehicles domestically in the month of November, down nearly 23% from 51,513 vehicles this time last year, according to data from Cox Automotive provided to Reuters. The November tally was the automaker's lowest monthly sales since January 2022.

The company launched stripped-down ""Standard"" versions of its Model Y SUV and Model 3 sedan in October, priced around $5,000 below previous base models. These cheaper EVs were intended to boost demand after the Trump administration ended the available federal tax credits in late September.

However, the new offerings appear to have failed in preventing Tesla's sales slide.

""The drop certainly shows there is not enough demand for the Standard variants that were supposed to boost sales after the tax credit expiry,"" Stephanie Valdez Streaty, Cox's director of industry insights, told Reuters. ""What's also happening is Standard sales are cannibalizing into sales of Premium versions, especially the Model 3.""

The problems might not end there, according to Streaty.

""Tesla has a serious challenge on its hands next year when several other automakers are planning to roll out cheaper vehicles that are also full of fun features,"" she told the news outlet. ""So the answer is that Tesla needs a completely new vehicle in its fleet. Period.""

Why is Tesla's sales slump important?

The sales decline affects both the company and its customers. Plummeting sales could hamper resale values for current Tesla owners, with oversupply and weakening demand usually depressing used car prices.

Customers thinking about purchasing a Tesla may also be facing uncertainty about whether the brand itself is losing momentum or is no longer something they wish to be affiliated with due to CEO Elon Musk's work for the Trump administration and far-right political rhetoric.

The automaker also hasn't introduced a new vehicle since the Cybertruck, which has struggled to find its footing in the marketplace. The rest of Tesla's fleet of vehicles consists of older models with minor refreshes, leaving customers with fewer compelling reasons to choose them over newer competitors in the marketplace.

Tesla's sales challenges have dominated the headlines for much of 2025, with the company needing a nearly impossible December to avoid finishing the year down in China, the world's largest EV market, per Electrek.

What's being done about EV adoption?

Despite Tesla's struggles, the broader EV transition continues.

Other automakers are planning to roll out cheaper EVs with new features in 2026, giving consumers more options for making the switch from gas-powered vehicles.

If you're thinking about making the switch, many manufacturers now offer compelling alternatives across several price points. Going electric can cut your fuel costs and reduce maintenance expenses, with each new EV on the road replacing the pollution from gas-powered cars with clearer air in our communities.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Tesla-salesimage-recHphVe9CQVa0WCb.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 19:56:58.065091

The regulator said that without this investment households would have faced an extra £55 a year in “constraint” costs to pay wind farms to switch off.

With just three days of the year left to go, the payments to wind farm owners to switch off have actually fallen slightly year on year, to £380 million from £395 million. However, the resulting cost of replacing this wasted wind power — typically with gas-fired power generation — has jumped from £835 million to £1.08 billion.

Octopus Energy said: “Britain paid over £1 billion in 2025 to switch off wind farms and burn expensive gas instead — wasting clean, homegrown energy. These costs are already absurd, and without urgent reform, they will soar to £8 billion a year by 2030. Fixing this broken system would unleash the full power of British renewables, cut bills, boost energy security and clean up the grid for good.”

• Thunderer: Britain is a leading light in wind power — don’t blow it now

Sam Richards of pro-growth campaign Britain Remade told the Telegraph, which first reported the full-year figures: “It represents a catastrophic failure of the energy system, and households are paying the price for it.

“While businesses and households see their bills rise, we’re throwing away British-generated electricity and firing up expensive gas plants instead.

“The result is higher costs, higher emissions, and zero benefit to consumers. The solution is obvious. We need to build the infrastructure that will allow us to use the clean power we already have.”

In July Ofgem said that the rising costs of paying wind farms to switch themselves off and paying for replacements had added £15 to a typical annual household energy bill from October.

In December the energy regulator approved plans that will see about £70 billion ploughed into upgrading Britain’s high-voltage electricity network over the next five years, adding about £60 to annual bills by 2030. The regulator said that without this investment households would have faced an extra £55 a year in “constraint” costs to pay wind farms to switch off. Even with this investment constraints are still expected to rise by about £10 per household per year, in addition to the levies to fund the network investment.

The rising costs are a further headache for the energy secretary Ed Miliband’s efforts to deliver on a pledge of cutting energy bills by £300 a year.

The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: “We are reversing decades of underinvestment and delivering the biggest upgrade to the grid, which will minimise constraint costs, meet the capacity needed to deliver clean power by 2030, and help bring down bills for households for good.

“The more renewables on the system, the cheaper the wholesale price of electricity, which is why the only answer for Britain is our mission to get us off the rollercoaster of fossil fuel prices and onto clean, homegrown power we control.”

Commercial production of ammonia from BNA is expected to begin following handover to Woodside Energy (“Woodside”) from OCI Global (“OCI”) in early 2026. Production of lower-carbon ammonia is targeted to start in the second half of 2026.

Demand for lower-carbon ammonia continues to develop globally, with strong interest from customers in Europe and Asia as they pursue energy security and decarbonisation objectives.

Woodside has also finalised agreements with leading global customers to supply significant volumes of conventional ammonia from the BNA facility.

Deliveries will commence in 2026 and continue through year-end, under contracts that reflect prevailing market prices. Additional agreements are being advanced to align with expected BNA output, including for lower-carbon ammonia.

Woodside Vice President Beaumont New Ammonia Kellyanne Lochan said: “We are pleased with the results of the commissioning and systems testing completed to date. These outcomes confirm the facility’s production readiness and our ability to move toward commercial start-up following handover. This milestone also reflects the disciplined work of both the OCI and Woodside teams.”

In the lead-up to handover, the project will continue with additional verification, performance testing, and operational preparedness activities. OCI and Woodside remain focused on ensuring the facility safely and efficiently enters full operations, in line with regulatory and contractual requirements.

BNA has a production capacity of 1.1 million tonnes per annum and is designed to support growing demand for ammonia, lower-carbon ammonia and hydrogen-adjacent products. Once operational, BNA has the potential to approximately double US ammonia exports1, contributing to regional economic growth and supporting American energy leadership.

We’ll be back to our regular schedule in the new year.

A climate competitiveness strategy that sidestepped emission reduction mandates for fossil fuel producers and set the stage to repeal a hard-fought cap on the industry’s carbon pollution was a centrepiece of the federal budget released in November by Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne.

The budget, titled Canada Strong, is the first produced by the government of Prime Minister Mark Carney. It reprises past promises to fast-track controversial new infrastructure projects, speed up new housing construction, and diversify the country’s trading relationships, increases military spending by $81.8 billion over five years, puts limits on the government’s commitments to sustainable finance and anti-greenwashing rules, and curtails the Trudeau government’s 2 Billion Trees program. It also lays out the broad lines of public service cutbacks that will slash $60 billion in federal spending and 40,000 jobs over five years, according to a memo issued Wednesday by the country’s top bureaucrat, Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Sabia.

Related: Nearly two dozen climate champions react to the budget in a live chat Tuesday evening hosted by The Energy Mix.

The budget places those changes in the context of the “profound transformation” sweeping the global economy.

“Industrial policy, once seen as secondary to market forces, is returning to the forefront,” the budget states. “In 2024 alone, governments worldwide introduced more than 2,500 industrial policy measures reflecting a transition in how governments are protecting national security interests and securing long-term competitiveness.”

In the United States, the Trump administration “is fundamentally reshaping all of its trading relationships and putting up trade barriers, with its average tariffs across all countries rising from around 2% at the end of 2024 to 17% today.” While the budget asserts repeatedly that Canada is faring better than other countries in its on-again, now off-again negotiations with the U.S., the impact of Trump’s tariff wars is still “profound—hurting companies, displacing workers, disrupting supply chains, and causing uncertainty that is curbing investment.”

As an antidote, the budget pitches an industrial strategy that pledges new infrastructure projects, public investment in research and development, lighter regulation, and tax deductions to trigger $500 billion in private sector investment over the next five years.

Competitiveness Over Climate?

The government’s climate competitiveness strategy was originally expected in mid- to late October, then delayed and folded into the budget announcement, prompting speculation that it wasn’t as fully defined as Carney had implied in his public statements. The published version cites climate action as an “economic necessity” as well as a “moral obligation”, at a time when “the world economy is undergoing a historic transformation towards low-carbon energy and clean technology.”

The document notes that global clean energy investments hit $2 trillion last year, nearly double the total poured into fossil fuels, and cites the Canadian Climate Institute’s warning that climate change will cut household incomes by nearly 20% by century’s end if it isn’t brought under control.

The strategy acknowledges that “buyers of Canada’s resources—oil and gas, steel, and aluminum—are increasingly looking for low-carbon sourcing.” It adds that “lowering our emissions is critical to protecting the competitiveness of Canada’s oil and gas and steel sectors. Reducing emissions is not only essential for environmental reasons, but also a key factor in securing access to markets that prioritize sustainability.”

But to meet that expectation, it sets sights on limiting the carbon intensity of Canadian industry—the emissions per barrel of oil or tonne of steel—rather than achieving actual reductions in climate pollution. In a sector like Canada’s oil sands, the difference matters—if production rises faster than emissions per barrel fall, the industry’s climate footprint will continue to grow. In September, the Climate Institute reported that the Canada’s progress on emissions flatlined in 2024, largely due to rising oil sands emissions, and the industry is planning on continuing production increases into the next decade.

The budget also:

• Allocates about $1 billion in tax incentives for “low-carbon liquefied natural gas facilities” that go into operation before 2030;

• Finalizes a clean electricity investment tax credit that was first introduced in the 2023 federal budget, but anticipates no spending at all through 2030;

• Extends the existing tax credit for carbon capture and storage by five years, to an end date of 2040 instead of 2035, but schedules no spending through 2030;

• Meets longstanding calls to expand the existing Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED) tax incentive system in ways that may disproportionately benefit early-stage clean technology companies;

• Cites the Darlington nuclear project outside Toronto, which will rely on uranium from the United States, as an example of “investing where it counts” in a new Buy Canada policy.

Trading Out the Emissions Cap

The budget stops short of eliminating the government’s watered-down, long-delayed cap on oil and gas emissions, but appears to trade it off for a stronger system of industrial carbon pricing and other measures meant to reduce the industry’s climate pollution.

The document says effective industrial carbon pricing is “essential to providing certainty to businesses looking to invest and compete internationally.” Already, it adds, that system “is expected to deliver more emission reductions than any other policy, with negligible impacts on affordability for Canadians.”

The budget pledges to “improve the effectiveness of carbon markets to provide confidence that credit prices will be predictable and sufficient to support clean growth investments without adversely affecting competitiveness or leading to carbon leakage.” Elements of that plan include:

• A multi-decade trajectory for industrial carbon pricing from 2030 through 2050, to be developed through engagement with provincial and territorial governments;

• Better federal benchmarks to ensure a consistent industrial carbon price across the country;

• Contracts for difference to give investors greater certainty about future carbon prices.

And to complement the industrial carbon price:

• Carrying on with the final, delayed version of federal Clean Electricity Regulations;

• Finalizing “enhanced” methane regulations for oil and gas operations and landfill sites, while allowing provincial and territorial governments to negotiate equivalency agreements based on their own control programs, with no reference in the document to serious, persistent problems in monitoring methane emissions;

• Future updates on electric vehicle mandates and clean fuel targets.

“Effective carbon markets, enhanced oil and gas methane regulations, and the deployment at scale of technologies such as carbon capture and storage would create the circumstances whereby the oil and gas emissions cap would no longer be needed as it would have marginal value in reducing emissions,” the budget states.

More New Homes, No Efficiency Target

The budget repeats Carney’s commitment of $13 billion over five years to launch the new Build Canada Homes agency and build up to 45,000 new housing units on existing federal lands. The program is meant to focus primarily on non-market housing and includes $423 million, already announced earlier this year, for eight new co-operative housing buildings.

Build Canada Homes aims to “catalyze maximum investment while mainstreaming advanced methods of construction, with the potential to cut building timelines by up to 50%, reduce costs by as much as 20%, and lower emissions by approximately 20% during construction,” the budget states. With that activity, “Canada can significantly increase its supply of affordable homes and become a global leader in housing innovation, including in construction techniques, sustainable materials, and leading-edge manufacturing.”

The budget makes no mention of energy efficiency or heat pump deployment targets for Build Canada Homes. Within 24 hours of the federal announcement, green building practitioners were worrying that the new units will become part of a huge backlog of homes awaiting energy retrofits to improve their performance and address heating and cooling costs that are an important factor in housing affordability.

Sustainable Finance Taxonomy: Target Date Set, Details Missing

The budget promises to complete its long-awaited sustainable finance taxonomy in 2026 and identify an arm’s length organization to develop sustainable investment guidelines by the end of this year. Canada’s taxonomy is an overdue response to a continuing international effort—in the field of finance, not biology—to set common definitions of sustainable investments that reduce emissions or support climate adaptation, and counter greenwashing around those activities.

“These investment guidelines will become an important, voluntary tool for investors, lenders, and other stakeholders navigating the global race to net-zero, by credibly identifying ‘green’ and ‘transition’ investments,” the budget states.

Those definitions have been the subject of fierce debate over more than three years, with some sustainable finance experts arguing it would be better to have no taxonomy at all than a system that allowed too much latitude for fossil fuel investment. Now, “the reconfirmed sustainable investment taxonomy, in moving forward, has to be fossil-free and centre independent experts outside of the financial sector. That’s foundational for it to be credible,” Julie Segal, senior program manager, climate finance at Environmental Defence Canada, said in an email.

“While it’s good that this government is paying attention to sustainable finance policies as it courts greater private sector investment, advancing solely on a taxonomy remains insufficient,” Segal added. “As Prime Minister Carney has said himself in previous roles, a cohesive package of mandatory transition plans, disclosure, and credible taxonomy is what’s needed. Until the full package of policies is delivered, it remains a missing piece of Canada’s climate plan.”

‘More Investor Risk’ with Weakened Greenwash Rules

The budget has also raised alarms by proposing to eliminate provisions in federal greenwashing legislation that require companies to verify environmental claims based on internationally recognized guidelines, and allow third parties to bring complaints to the federal Competition Tribunal.

In June, the Competition Bureau assured firms that the existing legislation, adopted by Parliament in June 2024, allows any marketing claims that aren’t false. But the budget still aims to offer “more certainty to the marketplace” by removing provisions that prompted fossil fuel companies and their lobby groups to not just update their websites, but burn them to the ground when the legislation was first adopted.

“The government’s proposal to weaken greenwashing provisions means more investor risk, particularly given the reluctance of provincial securities regulators to enforce accurate and complete disclosure in climate matters,” Matt Price, executive director of Investors for Paris Compliance, responded in a release.

“Removing the Competition Act amendments lets polluters mislead people in Canada and undermines truly sustainable businesses,” added the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment, one of the lead advocates for the legislation.

“Such needless retreat on climate and sustainable finance policy from a government led by Mark Carney is not something many experts would have expected,” said Adam Scott, executive director of Shift Action for Pension Wealth and Planet Health. “With the future stability and competitiveness of Canada’s economy on the line, we need much stronger leadership in the face of relentless industry lobbying. Canada needs credible guardrails in place to ensure the stability of our financial system and the climate.”

Cancelling the 2 Billion Trees Program

The budget signals a decision to wind down the Trudeau government’s commitment to plant two billion trees over 10 years, originally cast as “a significant step forward in Canada’s approach to tackle the dual crises of climate change and biodiversity loss.” Now, with nearly a billion trees committed, “existing contribution agreements and commitments will be honoured, and uncommitted funds will be returned,” the budget says.

With the Clean Economy Investment Tax Credits in place to drive investment, “the government remains committed to sustainable forest management practices,” the document adds.

The Canadian Tree Nursery Association countered that tree planting should receive “major project status, not cuts”, after the country lost an estimated 8% of its forest cover to wildfires between 2023 and 2025.

“This abrupt move not only threatens the long-term environmental recovery of Canada’s forests—which have already been devastated by recent wildfires—but also jeopardizes the livelihoods of workers, critical infrastructure, and the entire forest restoration sector,” Executive Director Rob Keen said in a release.

A Foot in the Door for the Youth Climate Corps

The budget earmarks $40 million over two years to launch a Youth Climate Corps, in which young Canadians “will be trained to quickly respond to climate emergencies, support recovery, and strengthen resilience in communities across the country. The skills training and work experience opportunities created through a Youth Climate Corps support reducing youth unemployment, increasing innovation, and strengthening adaptation and mitigation projects.”

Climate champions received the news as a lone ray of hope after years of coast-to-coast advocacy to get the idea funded.

“This is a win for hundreds of young activists and allies who have pressed hard for this idea, especially in the context of a budget that is significantly retreating on climate and decreasing overall program spending,” Climate Emergency Unit Team Lead Seth Klein said in a release. “But notably, $20 million a year will only produce about 350 full-time jobs for the whole country, which is not terribly consequential for tackling skyrocketing youth unemployment or addressing the climate crisis.”

The budget allocation “is a far cry from the $1 billion annual investment our campaign has called for, but it gets our foot in the door to prove the YCC’s worth,” Klein added. “So we will roll up our sleeves and work with the government to up the ambition for a Youth Climate Corps that matches the generational challenge.”

In November 2023, polling commissioned by the Emergency Unit indicated that even 20,000 spots per year would barely scratch the surface of the potential demand for the program. Some 65% of youth aged 18-35 said they would consider joining, and 15% said they would “definitely” consider. Interest was highest on the Prairies and in Atlantic Canada, followed by Quebec.

With nine million people across the country in the 18-35 age group, the 15% figure added up to 1.3 million potential applicants, Klein noted.

“They’re not saying maybe. They’re saying ‘definitely. I get it. If this exists, sign me up’,” he said. “1.3 million Canadians are saying, ‘where’s my goddamn invitation?’”

These two bills allow third-party professionals to inspect residential backup power systems in place of a city’s building department, also known as the Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ).
The installer can choose to use either the local AHJ or a qualified third-party for plan review, inspection, or both.
With this bill, projects can be done much more rapidly in just a few hours.
Potential problems with this bill Although passing this bill comes with some advantages, households might encounter some challenges in the future.","Inspecting your backup power at home might require a bit of patience. This is often because the city might be attending to a queue of people at the time, and you are probably behind a very long list. However, this might no longer be an issue following a recent government meeting.

The recently passed SB1252 and SB1202 bills.

Two Senate bills, Texas Senate Bill SB1252 and SB1202, were passed during the 89th Texas Legislative Session. But what are the benefits of these two bills? These two bills allow third-party professionals to inspect residential backup power systems in place of a city’s building department, also known as the Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ). But how exactly does this work?

The installer can choose to use either the local AHJ or a qualified third-party for plan review, inspection, or both. If a third-party is used, then the local codes must be requested from the AHJ. If the codes are not provided within two business days, the third-party would have to refer to the International Residential Code. As soon as the inspection is complete, the third party reaches out to AHJ and submits the documentation. The AHJ, however, has three witness days to issue the permit. Also, they don’t have the power to change the plan review for work done by a third party.

With this bill, projects can be done much more rapidly in just a few hours. Households no longer have to wait for city permitting offices for a long period of time. Also, it’s going to cost less to pay for these projects. This is because municipalities will not be able to request inspection fees for third-party reviews.

Why were these bills introduced?

One of the reasons why this bill was passed was to reduce the control cities have over energy projects. With third-party reviewers now available, local government no longer decides how quickly an application must be reviewed. Therefore, this makes cities have less influence over projects, giving more room for the third-party reviewers.

Potential problems with this bill

Although passing this bill comes with some advantages, households might encounter some challenges in the future. One of the biggest problems they might face is the low quality of inspection. A third-party might not follow due protocols like a city inspector, and this will lead to inconsistent application of safety standards. Also, because the third party is mostly hired and paid by the installer, they often give biased results just to keep their jobs. Therefore, they rush the inspection, give positive reviews, and approve plans quickly, even when things are not looking good.

Another major problem they might encounter is the work timeline. Normally, the city is often given three complete days to respond as soon as the documentation has been submitted. However, a third-party review has no set deadline and can take advantage of it. They might end up becoming lackadaisical and doing their job past the time households have set for them. Also, if a poorly reviewed system fails or is damaged, the households suffer the consequences, as they might not be covered by insurance, similar to this ground-breaking renewable energy project in New York.

What this bill means for the future of solar in Texas

By shifting responsibilities from the city to installers and households, the quality of services received depends on the choice made. This bill can be a gateway to faster and more affordable solar installation if the right decisions are made. And by removing long permitting delays, Texas is in a position to expand clean energy more quickly among users in the state. However, the success of this bill is heavily dependent on the reliability of the third-party guys to ensure that they provide the best quality of services to each household.",https://www.eldiario24.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/photo-1741188630852-e3151c41c80d.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 16:57:20.717953

Panaji : The Goa Energy Development Agency (GEDA) has started pushing for the implementation of the Clean Energy Roadmap for the State of Goa 2050, a long-term strategy to help the state switch over to 100 per cent clean and renewable energy and achieve economy-wide decarbonisation by 2050.

GEDA is working towards actionable programmes and on-ground implementation, in close association with stakeholders, said an official of the agency.

“We are working on many sectors like clean electricity and renewable energy supply, transport sector transformation, industry and commercial

buildings, agriculture, fisheries and rural energy use, clean cooking and household energy,” the official said.

The official said GEDA along with other agencies and with the support of the government is working toward transforming Goa into a low-carbon, climate-resilient and sustainable state by mid-century.

“Going beyond conventional power sector planning, the roadmap lays out an integrated, multi-sectoral approach to deep decarbonisation across all energy-consuming sectors of the economy,” the official explained.

The roadmap was launched in July 2023 on the G20 platform, and specific implementation workshops and broader promotion for the roadmap started later in October 2025.

“When we will achieve 100 per cent renewable energy usage across sectors by 2050 it will systematically reduce dependence on fossil fuels, promoting clean energy adoption and energy efficiency, and supporting economic growth,” the official reckoned.

The push will promote job creation and energy security and also help address climate change, the official said.

In the power sector, the roadmap sets out a transition to a fully renewable electricity system. This includes large-scale renewable energy projects and in-state generation such as rooftop solar, ground-mounted solar, floating solar, and other innovative solutions.

In transport, the document calls for rapid electrification of passenger vehicles and public transport. It also supports expanding electric mobility infrastructure and using biofuels and blended fuels for heavy transport and other hard-to-electrify uses.

For industry and commercial establishments, the roadmap focuses on the greater use of renewable electricity. It promotes energy-efficient technologies and switching from fossil fuels to cleaner alternatives.

In agriculture, fisheries, and rural livelihoods, the roadmap proposes solar-powered agricultural pumps. It also supports clean electricity and bioenergy solutions, and the use of biofuel blends in fishing and post-harvest activities.

The roadmap also prioritises clean cooking and household energy. It promotes biogas-based cooking systems and electric cooking powered by renewable energy.

The official also said the roadmap offers major investment opportunities in renewable energy that can create green and skilled jobs, grow local clean-energy industries, cut long-term energy costs and fuel imports, and strengthen energy security and climate flexibility.",https://navhindtimes.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/The-Navhind-Times-Featured-Default-1-1.png,N,,2025-12-28 18:57:53.768582

“Looking into 2026, demand for new energy batteries will drop drastically from the end of this year, so battery makers should cut production and take some rest to cope with the fluctuations,” Cui Dongshu, the industry body’s secretary general, said in a personal social media post.

China is the global leader in battery technology manufacturing and exports, and is benefiting from a worldwide boom in demand for batteries used in EVs and power networks.

A big drop in demand will hurt battery makers including Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd (CATL) and EVE Energy.

Cui said green passenger vehicle sales will fall at least 30 per cent early next year, from the fourth quarter, as tax incentives for car purchases are being phased out.

In addition, electric vehicles for commercial use will “definitely” slump in early 2026 after buyers rushed to buy vehicles by year-end for subsidies and tax breaks, Cui said.

The loss in domestic demand is unlikely to be offset by exports, he said.

These secondary minerals are not the main target of mining operations, so they are often separated out and discarded during processing. According to the researchers, recovering even small amounts of these overlooked materials could have a major impact on U.S. supply chains.

The researchers found that if 90 percent of these byproducts were recovered, they ""could meet nearly all U.S. critical mineral needs; one percent recovery would substantially reduce import reliance for most elements evaluated."" This means that even modest improvements in recovery technology could significantly reduce dependence on overseas sources.

What Are Critical Minerals and Why They Matter

Critical minerals are materials that are essential to the economy and national security but face supply risks due to limited domestic production or geopolitical instability. In the United States, this category includes minerals such as cobalt, nickel, manganese, lithium, tellurium, germanium, and many others.

These elements play key roles in modern technology. They are used in rechargeable batteries for electric vehicles, magnets for wind turbines, semiconductors for electronics, and solar panels for renewable energy. Some are also vital for defense systems, medical devices, and communications equipment.

Demand for these materials is growing rapidly as clean energy technologies expand. At the same time, many critical minerals are currently imported from regions affected by political tension or trade uncertainty. Developing entirely new mines can take decades, making alternative domestic sources especially attractive.

How Researchers Measured Untapped Mineral Potential

To estimate how much of these minerals could be recovered inside the United States, Holley and her colleagues combined two large datasets. One database tracked the main commodities produced at federally permitted U.S. metal mines. The other included detailed geochemical measurements showing the concentrations of 70 critical minerals found in ore samples across the country.

By pairing production data with mineral chemistry data, the team was able to estimate how much of each critical mineral is already being mined and processed, but not recovered. Instead, these materials end up in mine waste, also known as tailings, which must be stored and monitored to prevent environmental harm.

In many cases, the study found that recovering less than 10 percent of these byproducts would generate a higher total dollar value than the primary metals currently being sold by U.S. mines. This suggests that what is treated as waste today could become a major economic resource.

Economic, Strategic, and Environmental Benefits

The potential benefits of recovering critical mineral byproducts extend beyond economics. Reducing import dependence would strengthen supply security for industries tied to energy, technology, and defense. It could also help protect the U.S. from supply disruptions caused by international conflicts or trade restrictions.

There are environmental advantages as well. Recovering valuable minerals instead of discarding them would reduce the volume and long term impact of mine waste. It could also create new opportunities to reuse processed materials in construction and other applications.

Despite the promise, challenges remain. Recovering small amounts of minerals from complex ore mixtures requires advanced technology, additional processing steps, and supportive policies. As Holley has explained, the difficulty lies in making recovery practical and cost effective at scale.

Still, the findings point to a largely untapped opportunity. Active U.S. mines are already handling the materials needed for batteries, clean energy systems, and high tech manufacturing. With targeted investment, research, and policy incentives, these hidden byproducts could become a powerful domestic resource rather than a discarded one.",https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/1920/colorado-climax-mine.webp,N,,2025-12-28 14:57:34.398091

The United States has been developing a new foundation to advance the nuclear energy market through several projects and initiatives that were mandated by the current administration. It would appear that New Jersey is the latest state to plan a substantial investment to revive the US nuclear energy market.

New Jersey has passed new legislation regarding the revival of the US nuclear market

New Jersey recently passed the latest legislation that incentivises operators to develop new nuclear energy projects in the Garden State. The bill, known as the New Jersey Energy Security and Affordability Act, cleared the Senate Environment and Energy Committee easily.

The proposed legislation would promote the development of the nuclear energy sector in the state through several new initiatives, such as:

The Act will direct New Jersey’s Board of Public Utilities (BPU) to establish an Advanced Nuclear Development Fund that will require New Jersey rate payers to subsidise construction of 1,200 megawatts of power at the very least from qualifying nuclear generation projects in the Garden State.

The Act will require the state to establish an Advanced Nuclear Energy Certificate (ANEC) program, which will require basic generation service (BGS) providers and electric power suppliers to purchase new certificates generated by qualified nuclear projects in New Jersey.

The new proposed Advanced Nuclear Energy Certificate (ANEC) program will aim to promote the nuclear energy sector advancement by mandating that basic electricity providers in New Jersey deliver a percentage of kilowatt hours from nuclear energy produced in New Jersey.

The aim of the bill is to promote the use of nuclear energy in New Jersey as energy providers and utilities develop new nuclear projects that meet the state requirements to qualify for the new incentivised initiative, potentially transforming New Jersey into a hub for the nuclear energy revival in the United States.

The United States is fostering a new era of clean energy production from the nuclear sector

While the federal government rolls back wind energy project permits, the new Act aims to develop an investment framework for the nuclear energy market in New Jersey. A concern has been raised by rate payers organizations as the bill allows for basic electricity providers to pass on the costs to rate payers in the Garden State.

Any qualified nuclear energy project in the state may receive Advanced Nuclear Energy Certificates for each kilowatt of nuclear energy produced and sold in the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) region. However, any power sold out of state may not receive the accreditation.

As Los Angeles has developed the first-ever hydrogen-ready power plant, New Jersey is aiming to become a hub for the nuclear energy revival in the United States. Through the new bill that has passed muster with state lawmakers, New Jersey is one step closer to its ambitions being realised.

“There is no question we need an energy policy overhaul in America. A key part of that overhaul must include moving forward aggressively with expanding nuclear energy as a renewable energy source.” – Erik Paulsen

The US is entering a new era of nuclear energy generation

The new bill in New Jersey is just the latest initiative proposed to advance the nuclear energy revival in the United States. The US Energy Department has reported that the progress of increasing nuclear energy generation is picking up traction, as it has selected 11 potential advanced reactor demonstration projects that will position the US as the market leader in nuclear energy generation across the international energy market. Nuclear energy is making a triumphant comeback in the US.

The California Energy Commission recently approved over $40 million in grants to ""improve waterfront facilities at state ports for floating offshore wind projects,"" Riviera reported.

The funding will be divided among several projects, including pier evaluations and planning efforts at Port of Long Beach, upgrades to Humboldt Bay Harbor's offshore wind terminal, and the development of a wind terminal at the Port of San Luis Harbor, according to Riviera.

These infrastructure initiatives will accelerate California's transition to renewable energy sources and support the state's goal of complete carbon neutrality by 2045. The construction, support, and maintenance of the new and improved wind hubs will also create thousands of jobs.

Adam Stern, executive director of Offshore Wind California, said the grant approval is ""good news for Californian workers and residents who will benefit from gigawatts of reliable, clean offshore wind power. These grants … are a welcome milestone for deploying floating turbines 32-48 km off California's coast,"" per Riviera.

Besides creating jobs and increasing energy security, wind power offers environmental benefits, like improving air quality and preserving natural resources. The most significant environmental benefit of wind power and other forms of renewable energy is the reduced reliance on finite dirty fuels.

Burning fossil fuels, which include coal, oil, and gas, releases planet-warming gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. The resulting air pollution is responsible for millions of premature deaths each year.

For California residents, these projects will increase homeowners' access to reliable, safe, clean electricity. The plan is to produce 148,000 megawatts of energy through renewable means — enough to power 25 million homes.

The state is making great progress. In 2024, California's solar, wind, and water produced enough power to meet the state's electricity demand for nearly 100 days.

This month, the automaker scrapped not one but two major EV battery deals: an $11.4 billion joint venture with South Korea’s SK On, and a $6.5 billion supply agreement with LG Energy Solution.

While it’s tapping the brakes on its EV ambitions for the time being, Ford is putting more weight behind a different kind of battery, the kind built to power entire grids.

Read: Ford Kills Major Battery Deal As EV Plans Rapidly Unravel

The company signed a licensing deal in 2023 with Chinese battery heavyweight CATL to use its lithium iron phosphate (LFP) technology. The original plan was to manufacture EV batteries using CATL’s chemistry, bringing production in-house with a technical edge from one of the world’s largest battery makers. That plan has changed.

Shifting Power to the Grid

Instead of funneling CATL’s LFP chemistry into cars, Ford will now use it to produce large-format batteries designed for energy storage. These units, built at scale, are intended for use by utilities and grid operators.

“Given the fact that we already had a license to build that technology in the US, you couple that with our manufacturing experience, over a century of high-scale manufacturing, it just made a lot of sense as a natural adjacency for us,” Ford vice president of technology platform programs and EV systems, Lisa Drake told Bloomberg.

Ford has had to walk through a political minefield to bring its deal with CATL to life. Virginia’s Governor rejected Ford’s plans to build a battery plant there using CATL technology due to its Chinese ties. Ford is now building its plant in Michigan and expects to open it next year.

As the Trump administration pushes to reduce America’s reliance on Chinese products, Ford believes its approach is better than continuing to import the Chinese-made batteries that have already become common in the U.S. energy sector.

The Case for Building at Home

“Given the ongoing needs of US energy producers, it seems like a no-brainer to support efforts to produce batteries in America instead of importing more of them from China,” Ford added.

The carmaker has also revealed that it spoke with potential customers to see if there was demand for it to sell energy storage cells. It “received resounding affirmation.” Not only are LFP cells great for EVs, but they’re also well-suited for energy storage, hence why Ford’s move makes sense.",https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Ford-Factory-j-copy.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 14:57:27.324955

“Don’t buy the lie that clean energy is expensive,” he said.
“Making electric heat technologies more affordable lets more facilities swap out dirty fossil fuel boilers for clean electric options.” Energy efficiency upgrades, meanwhile, are a no-brainer according to the duo.","In a virtual launch on December 16, UC Santa Barbara’s 2035 Initiative unveiled a detailed roadmap for a seemingly obvious target of climate action: cleaning up the industrial sector.

Titled The Clean Heat Climate Opportunity, the new report maps out a pathway for electrifying low- and medium-temperature industrial heat — the kind used in making everything from paper and plastics to beer and frozen pizza. And the findings are clear: This shift could slash U.S. climate pollution by as much as 26 percent in key sectors while unlocking nearly half a trillion dollars in public health benefits by 2050.

“To hit our climate goals, it’s not just cars and buildings that need to go electric — it’s also big factories,” said Leah C. Stokes, one of the report’s principal investigators and an Associate Professor at UCSB. “Most of what we eat, drink, and use every day gets made with heat from burning fossil fuels. Fortunately, we can swap out dirty technologies with clean alternatives like electric heat pumps that can cut pollution, improve air quality, and modernize U.S. manufacturing.”

As stated early on in the presentation, industrial operations account for roughly a quarter of America’s greenhouse gas emissions, and the U.S. is second only to China as the world’s largest emitter.

Enter the 2035 Initiative, UCSB’s own “think-and-do tank,” which blends engineering models, public policy research, and on-the-ground engagement to accelerate climate solutions. This particular project was co-led as principal investigators by Stokes and Professor Eric Masanet, who holds the Mellichamp Chair in Sustainability Science for Emerging Technologies.

“The industrial sector is complex, which often makes smart policy hard to design,” Masanet said. “Our engineering models cut through that complexity to pinpoint opportunities that are both realistic and actionable in real-world plants.”

According to the report, electrifying heat processes in three energy-intensive sectors — chemicals, pulp and paper, and food and beverage — could cut cumulative emissions by 930 to 1,320 million metric tons of CO₂-equivalent through 2050. That’s up to 26 percent of the climate pollution from major facilities in these sectors.

And there is financial incentive. The analysis estimates $288 billion to $475 billion in avoided public health costs from reduced air pollutants like nitrogen oxides and fine particulate matter. These emissions are linked to respiratory illness, heart disease, and cancer.

“These programs are the future of our country,” said Senator Martin Heinrich (D-NM), who spoke during the launch event alongside Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI). “People want hot showers and cold beer — same approach to the industrial sector.” Heinrich expanded that to mean that we can get the same output with a cleaner, and more cost-effective, setup.

Whitehouse didn’t mince words about the stakes. “Don’t buy the lie that clean energy is expensive,” he said. “The Trump administration lies about the cost.”

The report lands at a time when federal climate policy is being sharply reversed. Since returning to office, President Trump has cut billions from key clean energy programs, including the $7 billion “Solar for All” initiative aimed at low-income households, and canceled hundreds of Department of Energy awards that had supported battery production, hydrogen hubs, and EV manufacturing. The administration has also paused new approvals for wind energy — including offshore — while ramping up fossil fuel development on federal lands. Lawsuits challenging these moves are now playing out in courts across the country.

“States can unlock progress on industrial electrification today,” said Stokes. “Making electric heat technologies more affordable lets more facilities swap out dirty fossil fuel boilers for clean electric options.”

Energy efficiency upgrades, meanwhile, are a no-brainer according to the duo. Measures like steam system optimization and process controls can shrink electricity demand while boosting savings for businesses.

This work is part of a growing portfolio at the 2035 Initiative, which is also developing global climate opinion maps, working on grid resilience for vulnerable communities, and tracking climate concern in small island nations.

Though headquartered on UCSB’s campus, the Initiative’s work aims to reach Washington, D.C. “This roadmap is meant to show policymakers where the low-hanging fruit is,” Stokes said. “There are facilities across the country that should start looking at swapping out their fossil fuels ASAP because it might save them money.”",https://www.independent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-32-Large.jpeg?fit=1200%2C514,N,,2025-12-28 13:58:08.176307

How does AI enhance EV charging?","Analysis

Tesla's expansion into commercial EV charging solutions, such as the recently highlighted commercial wall connector, represents a significant stride in integrating artificial intelligence with sustainable energy infrastructure. According to reports from Electrek in late 2023, Tesla has been enhancing its charging hardware to support fleet operations and business environments, building on its AI-driven ecosystem that optimizes energy distribution. This development aligns with broader AI trends in the electric vehicle sector, where machine learning algorithms are employed to manage charging schedules, predict energy demands, and integrate with smart grids. For instance, Tesla's AI systems, as detailed in their 2022 AI Day presentation, utilize neural networks to analyze real-time data from vehicles and chargers, enabling dynamic load balancing that reduces peak-hour strain on electrical grids. In the industry context, this comes at a time when global EV adoption is surging; data from the International Energy Agency's 2023 report indicates that electric car sales exceeded 10 million units in 2022, with projections for 14 million in 2023, driving demand for intelligent charging solutions. Tesla's commercial wall connector, capable of delivering up to 48 amps of power, incorporates AI features like over-the-air updates and integration with the Tesla app, which uses predictive analytics to suggest optimal charging times based on user behavior and energy prices. This not only enhances efficiency but also positions Tesla as a leader in the AI-enhanced energy management space, competing with companies like ChargePoint and EVgo. Moreover, ethical implications arise in ensuring data privacy for commercial users, with Tesla adhering to best practices outlined in the 2021 California Consumer Privacy Act regulations. The implementation challenges include scalability in urban areas with limited grid capacity, but solutions like AI-optimized vehicle-to-grid technology, as explored in a 2023 study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, offer pathways to mitigate these issues. Looking ahead, this could catalyze market opportunities in commercial real estate, where AI-driven charging infrastructure boosts property values by up to 15 percent, according to a 2023 CBRE report on sustainable buildings.

From a business perspective, Tesla's commercial wall connector opens up lucrative market opportunities in the burgeoning EV infrastructure sector, projected to reach $100 billion globally by 2030, as per a 2023 BloombergNEF analysis. Companies can monetize this through subscription-based AI analytics services that provide insights into energy usage patterns, enabling cost savings of up to 20 percent on electricity bills, based on Tesla's 2022 pilot programs with commercial fleets. The competitive landscape features key players like ABB and Siemens, but Tesla's edge lies in its integrated AI ecosystem, including the Dojo supercomputer announced in 2021, which trains models for predictive maintenance on charging equipment. Regulatory considerations are crucial, with the U.S. Department of Energy's 2023 guidelines emphasizing AI compliance in energy systems to ensure cybersecurity. Businesses implementing these connectors face challenges such as high initial costs, averaging $1,000 per unit as of 2023 pricing, but solutions include financing models and government incentives from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, offering tax credits up to 30 percent for commercial EV infrastructure. Ethical best practices involve transparent AI decision-making to avoid biases in energy allocation, as recommended by the AI Now Institute's 2023 report. Future implications point to expanded monetization strategies, like partnering with utilities for demand-response programs, potentially generating additional revenue streams estimated at $5 billion annually for the sector by 2025, according to McKinsey's 2023 energy outlook. In terms of industry impact, this trend accelerates the shift towards AI-optimized logistics for e-commerce giants like Amazon, which reported integrating similar tech in 2023 to reduce fleet downtime by 25 percent. Overall, Tesla's move underscores how AI can transform business operations, fostering innovation in sustainable transport and creating new job opportunities in AI engineering, with the sector expected to add 97 million jobs by 2025, per the World Economic Forum's 2020 Future of Jobs report updated in 2023.

Technically, the commercial wall connector leverages Tesla's advanced AI frameworks, including computer vision and reinforcement learning, to enable features like automatic fault detection, as demonstrated in their 2023 software updates.

Unlike Ohio’s Honda-centered approach, Michigan’s EV footprint is spread across multiple OEMs — GM, Ford, and Stellantis — each adjusting timelines and production plans amid shifting federal policy and market demand. Several high-profile projects have been delayed or scaled back, fueling debate over incentives, land use, and community acceptance.

Still, Michigan remains the center of gravity for Midwest mobility.

The state’s supplier density, engineering workforce, testing facilities, and charging infrastructure goals — including a plan to deploy 100,000 EV chargers by 2030 — give it structural advantages competitors struggle to replicate. More than 27% of Michigan’s economy remains tied to automotive and mobility industries, anchoring its long-term relevance even as EV growth slows.

Ohio’s model offers a contrast: fewer OEMs, fewer suppliers, but clearer alignment between manufacturing, batteries, and workforce retraining. Indiana and Illinois occupy middle ground, with Indiana leaning on cost competitiveness and Illinois relying heavily on Rivian as a single EV anchor.

Industry analysts say the Midwest’s EV race is entering a second phase — less about announcements and more about execution.

“The early EV boom was about who could land the biggest press release,” said one Midwest auto analyst. “The next phase is about who can actually build profitably, train workers, and survive slower adoption.”

For Michigan, that means translating its massive ecosystem into durable EV production — not just investment commitments. For Ohio, it means proving a focused EV hub can scale beyond one automaker.

Either way, the Midwest remains central to America’s EV future — but the balance of power inside the region is still very much in flux.",https://mitechnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Michigan-EV-workforce-map-overview.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 11:58:48.909548

Global green bond and loan issuance has reached a record $947 billion so far this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. That's as stock market gauges for renewables are set for their first annual gains since 2020, outperforming the S&P 500 by a wide margin, while shares of power-grid technology companies remain in favor.

The flows are notable in a year when US President Donald Trump backed fossil fuels and dismantled clean-energy subsidies and legislation. Europe also has rolled back some of its toughest environmental rules amid concerns about growth and competitiveness.

Still, clearer policy signals and an almost 4% expected increase in global electricity demand, driven by AI, cooling and electrification needs, are lifting investor optimism.

""Green investments are increasingly becoming viewed as core infrastructure and industrial plays, not just niche ESG trades,"" said Melissa Cheok, associate director for ESG investment research at Sustainable Fitch. ""Capital is likely flowing toward areas with clear revenue visibility, policy backing and structural demand such as grid upgrades and renewables tied to electrification.""

Asia-Pacific companies and government-linked issuers raised $261 billion from green debt, up about 20% from a year earlier, with China and India backing the rollout of renewables, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. China had a record $138 billion in green bond issuance, led by its biggest lenders. It also debuted a sovereign offering in London earlier this year.

The so-called greenium - the lower borrowing costs on green bonds - is most evident in Asia-Pacific, with some issuers getting more than a 14-basis-point discount for using a green label in November, according to BloombergNEF. Green bonds are often used by companies to raise money for switching to renewable energy or lower-carbon transportation.

BNP Paribas SA and Credit Agricole SA are this year's leading underwriters of green bonds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The amount of outstanding green bonds has grown at a 30% compound annual rate over the past five years and issuance now accounts for about 4.3% of the global total, LSE Group researchers said last month.

Easing US interest rates and refinancing needs may boost global green bond sales to as much as $1.6 trillion next year, said Crystal Geng, environmental, social and governance research lead for Asia at BNP Paribas Asset Management.

Green stocks have been a market leader this year. Clean-energy indexes from S&P Dow Jones Indices and WilderShares have surged 45% and 60%, respectively, though both remain below their 2021 peaks.

US solar and battery storage stocks, including SolarEdge Technologies Inc., have been among the top performers, while wind turbine makers have led gains in China and Germany. India has emerged as a hotspot for renewable-energy initial public offerings, with 11 listings raising more than $1 billion and another six companies seeking more than $3 billion. Last year, 14 renewable energy companies raised $2.4 billion through IPOs.

Not all markets are benefiting. US green debt issuance fell 7% to $163 billion this year and supranational bond sales declined by a similar amount. Fundraising in Germany was steady at roughly $79 billion.

While India saw record green loan volumes of $7 billion, strong interest from foreign banks has intensified competition, squeezing financing margins by 5% to 10% on renewable energy and other projects, said Jeanne Soh, head of structured finance for Asia at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp.

Sales of sustainability-linked debt slumped about 50% this year to $165 billion amid greenwashing concerns, Bloomberg Intelligence data show. Transition bond issuance more than halved to $10.9 billion for hard-to-abate sectors.

The trends are likely to reverse over the next two years, said Xuan Sheng Ou Yong, a client portfolio manager for sustainable investing at Robeco in Singapore. Changes to European fund rules will let asset managers define what qualifies as a sustainable investment, opening the door to emissions-cutting investments in higher-polluting sectors, he said.

Overall, global sustainable debt volumes stood at about $1.6 trillion this year, down more than 8% from 2024, the Bloomberg Intelligence data show. Separately, more than $500 billion of social bonds were sold in the US tied to the Government National Mortgage Association, known as Ginnie Mae, which guarantees principal and interest on mortgage-backed securities.

The move will see the company shift US EV battery production lines to ESS output ahead of 2027.

Michigan-based Samsung SDI America will begin manufacturing battery energy storage system (BESS) cells at the company’s Indiana facility, where the manufacturer has been shifting some its production lines from cell production for EVs to prismatic LFP cell production for BESS units – a move the company claims will allow it to more closely align with domestic market demands.

“It is a significant opportunity for Samsung SDI to expand into the US ESS market with the first long-term contract for LFP supply,” said a Samsung official. “Through the first supply of SBB 2.0 for ESS installation in the US, Samsung SDI will start providing US customers with ESS batteries to meet their needs not only for high-performance but also for enhanced safety and price competitiveness, enabling them to stabilize power supplies in the era of renewable energy and AI.”

What’s in the box

Prismatic LFPs are encased in rigid aluminum housings that give them greater resistance to external shocks and impact damage, while promising lower heat and improved thermal safety compared to more familiar, pouch format cells. That construction, along with other proprietary anti-thermal propagation (read: fire safety) designs that limit heat spread between cells, make prismatic LFPs an attractive option for utility-scale BESS deployments where fire risk and system reliability are top priorities for utilities and data centers.

Each Samsung Battery Box (SBB) unit is packaged into a standard 20-foot container that incorporates a number of battery racks, battery management systems, and thermal management systems (both cooling and fire safety) for quick, easy deployment.

The company also pointed out that Samsung SDI is regarded as the only non-Chinese manufacturer of prismatic batteries currently operating in the US, a position the company believes strengthens its competitive standing as it expands its presence in North America.

Electrek’s Take

Samsung kicked off the launch of its SSB 2.0 at RE+ earlier this year with the words, “All-American, Proven, and Ready,” emphasizing the company’s role as a creator of American jobs with statements like, “Samsung SDI aims to strengthen competitiveness in the US market …” which reads, to me, like the company is trying to ride a wave of Sinophobia as it positions itself for leadership in the data center BESS market, just as the big Chinese and American tech players continue to separate from one another.

The only problem I see there is that the kind of American voters who buy into that particular brand of anti-China propaganda probably can’t tell the difference between China and Korea. Change my mind, in the comments.

Japan has set a ‘linear pathway’ to achieving its 2035 climate goals, but reliance on fossil fuels remains an obstacle. This is why Japan is turning to America for hydrogen, hoping that a 15-year, 500,000-ton bet will help the country move past coal and gas as primary fuels for power. Discover how these two countries’ collaboration will help Japan go green.

Japan is seeking greener pastures with a 15-year, 500,000-ton bet

Just like the world, Japan is also seeking greener pastures, especially as the deadline for its climate goals is looming around the corner. The country is aiming to achieve the following:

A 60% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to 2013 levels by 2035, and

By 2040, a 73% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to 2013 levels

Convinced that these specific goals will help the country meet the global mission of achieving net-zero by 2050, Japan is now actively investing in alternative fuels and energies to decrease its coal and gas dependency. According to Reuters, over 50% of Japan’s power was generated by fossil fuels during 2024/2025, of which coal and gas were the primary sources.

Fortunately, Japan is turning to America for hydrogen in its venture to greener pastures, which will play a significant role in the country’s transition away from fossil fuels.

Japan turns to America for hydrogen

All eyes have been on Japan since the 2025 Japan Summit & Exhibition, where Japan’s Energy for a New Era (JERA) hinted at new LNG Agreements.

The biggest power-producing company in Japan, JERA, has made a 15-year government-supported bet on ammonia imports from America. This subsidy will help cover the difference between coal and ammonia expenses, as imports are planned to commence by 2029. Earlier this year, JERA partnered with CF Industries and Mitsui for the Blue Point project.

The Blue Point project is a nearly $4 billion project, which will boast one of the biggest low-carbon ammonia facilities in the world. The Blue Point project is situated in Louisiana, and Mitsui will be responsible for supplying the project’s partners, which is planned to commence by 2030. The project will provide 280,000 tons of ammonia each year to the following partners (among others):

Hokkaido Electric Power

Mitsubishi UBE Cement

Tosoh

This is how Japan will benefit from U.S. imports

JERA itself plans on benefitting from nearly 500,000 tons annually from the Blue Point project, as ammonia and hydrogen are key to the country’s venture into greener pastures. According to Anri Nakamura, principal hydrogen research analyst at S&P Global Energy Horizons, the decision is an exciting development for the country’s hydrogen policy, which has remained quiet until now. Nakamura added:

“These agreements also strengthen ammonia cofiring plans at power plants supported by long-term decarbonized power auctions. While burning ammonia in coal plants is costly, we expect this volume can be supported by the CFD budget, especially if higher-value industrial applications are also developed.”

According to a JERA spokesperson, the ammonia imports will be extremely vital for Japan, as JERA will commence 20% ammonia cofiring at the 1 GW No. 4 Hekinan coal-fired unit starting 2029/2030. The ammonia will also be used at the Tomata-Atsume thermal power plant, as well as a fuel for Mitsubishi UBE Cement. Tosoh will use it as raw material.

This project is only the first step towards Japan’s better, greener future, a step that will significantly lower the country’s carbon footprint while helping it achieve its climate goals in no time. Ammonia is exceptional as a low-carbon fuel or feedstock, which is most likely why Japan has also been focusing on ammonia-powered ship engines. The country has completed its first factory trials, proving how valuable its U.S. ammonia import investment is for the future.

We’ll be back to our regular schedule in the new year.

Energy and Natural Resources Minister Tim Hodgson drew praise from fossil industry supporters in August and set off alarm bells in the climate community with his statement that there’s sure to be a market for new Canadian liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports, in spite of a looming global gas glut.

“I know there are buyers,” Hodgson told CTV host Vassy Kapelos last week.

“Our production is much closer to Asian markets. Our production is much cleaner than the American in terms of carbon footprint,” he said. “And what I can tell you from the conversations that the prime minister has been having, the minister of foreign affairs has been having, the minister of international trade has been having, the conversations I’ve been having, our allies are very interested in Canadian LNG.”

Canadians can “expect to see projects announced in the early fall,” Hodgson added, via a “rolling set of announcements” as proponents pitch projects that respond to the five criteria set out in the government’s controversial major projects legislation.

“More customers, more shipments, more LNG export facilities, means more jobs for Canadians, more opportunities for Indigenous partnerships, and certainly a more economically secure country,” responded Lisa Baiton, president and CEO of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, notwithstanding staunch opposition emerging from many Indigenous organizations and communities.

CTV recounts a long exchange in which Kapelos tried to pin Hodgson down on whether the government will abandon its emission reduction targets or environmental assessment rules to get LNG projects done. Hodgson maintained Canadians should “be proud” that its LNG has the “lowest carbon footprint of any produced in the world.” But Canadian Climate Institute principal economist Dave Sawyer said even that “cleaner” LNG will still produce “a lot of emission,” so that “the math is inescapable.”

“The challenge has always been to balance out economic growth, and really, emission-intensive resource growth, with policy that sort of bends the emission curve down,” he told CTV. “And when you’re putting in these big, large, lumpy emission projects, you need some pretty strong policy to counter the emissions.”

The government’s initial list of “nation-building” megaprojects doesn’t include LNG. But that didn’t stop Alberta Energy and Minerals Minister Brian Jean from praising the statement on his Facebook page.

“Excited to see these approvals move forward!” Jean wrote. “Alberta is ready to seize new opportunities and help Canada reach its full potential as a true energy superpower.”

Calgary Herald columnist Chris Varcoe says Hodgson’s remarks rippled through the fossil industry “like a stone skipping across calm water.”

“The fact we’re hearing that from our own government now, the federal government, is a very positive sign. It’s a long way from, ‘There’s no business case for LNG,’ which we heard from the previous government,” said Peyto Exploration and Development CEO Jean-Paul Lachance. “That gives me some confidence that there’s going to be some support for LNG projects within Canada… It sends the right signal to the capital markets that we’re open for business here.”

“People in other countries have been waiting to hear the federal government of Canada speak in this way,” Shannon Joseph, chair of Energy for a Secure Future, told Varcoe.

But others were listening, too. “Minister Hodgson believes there is an international appetite for LNG—but with a global gas glut looming, this could not be further from the truth,” Climate Action Network Canada Executive Director Caroline Brouillette said in a statement. “The Minister should be focusing exclusively on the projects with the highest likelihood of success—ones that are based on inexpensive technologies and that will make our country resilient in the long run. Renewable energy, storage, and electricity transmission projects are all no-brainers.”

[Disclosure: Energy Mix Productions is a member of CAN-Rac.]

Investors for Paris Compliance Executive Director Matt Price had a more visceral take on Hodgson’s remarks.

“Our son just got home from fighting the 588-hectare Cameron Lake fire, only to hear about the new 1,391-hectare (and growing) fire south of Port Alberni,” he wrote last week on LinkedIn. “And we’re still talking about new fossil fuel infrastructure?”

Last week, Hodgson was back in the news announcing $13.2 million in funding for five new smart projects in Mississauga, Toronto, Waterloo, and M’Chigeeng, on Manitoulin Island. Today, he’s scheduled for an announcement at the Bruce nuclear station near Tiverton.

“People in other countries have been waiting to hear the federal government of Canada speak in this way,” Shannon Joseph, chair of Energy for a Secure Future, told Varcoe.

But others were listening, too. “Minister Hodgson believes there is an international appetite for LNG—but with a global gas glut looming, this could not be further from the truth,” Climate Action Network Canada Executive Director Caroline Brouillette said in a statement. “The Minister should be focusing exclusively on the projects with the highest likelihood of success—ones that are based on inexpensive technologies and that will make our country resilient in the long run. Renewable energy, storage, and electricity transmission projects are all no-brainers.”

Investors for Paris Compliance Executive Director Matt Price had a more visceral take on Hodgson’s remarks.

“Our son just got home from fighting the 588-hectare Cameron Lake fire, only to hear about the new 1,391-hectare (and growing) fire south of Port Alberni,” he wrote last week on LinkedIn. “And we’re still talking about new fossil fuel infrastructure?”

Last week, Hodgson was back in the news announcing $13.2 million in funding for five new smart projects in Mississauga, Toronto, Waterloo, and M’Chigeeng, on Manitoulin Island. Today, he’s scheduled for an announcement at the Bruce nuclear station near Tiverton.",https://www.theenergymix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tim-Hodgson-CPACYouTube.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 11:13:23.211862

Fossil fuel employment has fallen to less than 1% of the Canadian work force, while growth in global energy jobs outpaced the wider economy for the third year in a row, according to two back-to-back reports released earlier in the year.

In Canada, the fossil industry has dropped 38,000 jobs in the last five years, mostly in upstream oil and gas, even though production increased 35% for oil and 24% for natural gas over that period, the Centre for Future Work reported Monday.

“This long-term decline is set to continue for many reasons, not solely or mostly climate policy. New technologies, economic forces, resource depletion, and corporate outsourcing strategies are all eliminating fossil fuel jobs,” the Vancouver-based organization said in a release. The 95-page report concludes [pdf] that:

• The job transition out of fossil fuels is taking place in spite of any efforts in national climate policy, not because of them.

• The pace of the decline is consistent with a full phaseout of fossil fuels by 2050.

• Most of today’s fossil fuel workers will have reached normal retirement age by then.

• Interviews with workers showed that most of them expect to see the industry decline, but are reasonably confident the transition can be managed without mass displacement.

• Federal “just transition” efforts to date have been “long on aspiration and consultation, and short on implementation and effective guarantees.”

• Transition planning in Canada “is made even more nebulous by the fact that no general transition away from fossil fuel production and use is in fact occurring,” except for the 2030 federal mandate to phase out coal.

The research “confirms that an employment transition away from fossil fuel jobs is occurring, and occurring quickly,” said report co-author and centre director Jim Stanford. “Regardless of the twists and turns of climate policy debates, that decline will continue, driven by deeper economic and technological factors.”

But when it comes to just transition planning, “most policies emphasize consultation and dialogue, not binding agreements and entitlements,” the report states. “Instead of clear guarantees of employment and income for affected workers, workers are typically offered retraining subsidies and career counselling. In a labour market defined by chronic insecurity and fierce competition for decent work, this does not convince fossil fuel workers that their employment and incomes will be protected.”

Stanford added that a new oil pipeline megaproject, like the one envisioned in last month’s sweeping memorandum of understanding between Canada and Alberta, won’t reverse the trend. “Building a pipeline creates medium-term construction, he said—but no more than equivalent amounts spent on other energy investments” in renewable energy, transition, energy retrofits, or public transit.

On a global scale, many of those job categories are soaring, the International Energy Agency reported Friday, with the energy sector outpacing the global economy in 2024 for the third year in a row and increasing its work force to 76 million.

“Strong investment in energy infrastructure drove a 2.2% rise in energy jobs last year, nearly double the rate of employment growth for the wider global economy,” the Paris-based agency said in a release, with electricity surpassing fuel supply as the biggest industry employer for the first time.

The IEA reports that:

• Photovoltaic solar has been a “principal driver of demand, accounting for half of the job additions in the electricity sector since 2019.”

• Almost all the jobs in the power sector were in low-emitting power generation, grids, or storage, with only a small percentage in unabated fossil generation.

• Nuclear power, grids, and storage have provided 25% of the new power sector jobs.

• Offshore wind saw layoffs in turbine manufacturing and other “persistent challenge”, leading to a 6% job decline last year.

• Jobs in electric vehicle manufacturing grew by 800,000, with EVs and batteries now accounting for about 40% of automotive employment in China.

• Oil and gas has recovered most of the jobs it lost in the COVID-19 pandemic. But “it now appears that many firms are entering a new period of retrenchment in the face of lower oil prices and revenues, with a number of major oil companies announcing job cuts in 2025.”

• Coal jobs have increased in India, China, and Indonesia, growing 8% between 2019 and 2024.

Skilled worker shortages emerged as a key concern in the IEA’s annual Energy Employment Survey, with more than half of respondents reporting critical hiring bottlenecks and an aging work force compounding the problem.

“Most of the top energy occupations facing constraints within energy are considered applied technical roles, including electricians, pipefitters, electrical power line workers, and engineers, particularly in nuclear,” the IEA wrote. “Many of these broader categories are already in short supply across the wider economy.”

It states: “Lowering our emissions is critical to protecting the competitiveness of Canada’s oil and gas and steel sectors.
The budget has left many wondering about the future of the emissions cap, which the government hints could become unnecessary down the road, but doesn’t outright eliminate.
He said polling shows there’s nothing to suggest the emissions cap is truly controversial in Canada and there is a lot of support for climate action.
We’re still waiting,” Caroline Brouillette, executive director of Climate Action Network Canada, said in a statement shared with the chat.","Disappointment and frustration were common themes among climate champions and experts who joined The Energy Mix for an online chat this afternoon and evening about the new federal budget or shared their comments from elsewhere with us.

“My first take is that neither the tone nor the measures reflect a sense of urgency with regard to climate change, except to the extent there are business opportunities that might be missed,” said Ralph Torrie, research director of Corporate Knights.

Catherine Abreu, director of the International Climate Politics Hub and member of Canada’s Net-Zero Advisory Body, referred to “the dumpster fire that is Carney dismantling Canada’s climate architecture while talking about ‘bargains.’ It’s not a bargain when one side—in this case, the climate—loses everything it has, and the other side—fossil fuel shareholders—gets everything it wants.” Abreu was unable to join the group today, but replied to The Mix’s invitation earlier this week from Rio, where she is already onsite for pre-COP30 meetings.

“We were looking for much-needed clarity on how Ottawa would diversify the economy away from volatile fossil fuels, meet our international climate obligations, and steer Canada towards a safer and more affordable clean energy future. We’re still waiting,” Caroline Brouillette, executive director of Climate Action Network Canada, said in a statement shared with the chat.

“This budget shows that ‘austerity’ applies to efforts to protect people and the planet—but that more money can always be found for military spending and polluting industries,” Brouillette continued. “It fails to make any reference to emissions reductions commitments or Canada’s next international climate finance contribution, announces plans to water down anti-greenwashing legislation, takes another step away from the cap on oil and gas emissions, and cuts international assistance.”

“Today’s budget exposes a missed opportunity for Canada to invest in local economies and urban climate action,” added Bryan Purcell, vice-president of policy and programs for The Atmospheric Fund. “While the federal government reaffirms support for clean electricity and other broad climate measures, the budget offers limited funding or tools to help cities reduce emissions, adapt to climate impacts, or build local resilience. A lack of funding or policy signals to support electric vehicles or energy efficiency leaves struggling domestic industries even more uncertain, and climate targets further out of reach.

“Budget 2025’s Climate Competitiveness Strategy recognizes the economic growth potential of clean energy and the investments needed to bolster Canada’s clean energy sector. While it reaffirms the importance of the Investment Tax Credits, the strategy lacks the ambition needed to keep Canada competitive with leading clean economies. It does little to advance key technologies that could reduce costs for Canadians, such as electric vehicles, heat pumps, and rooftop solar.”

The 14-page document starts with an unequivocal statement: “Climate action is not just a moral obligation—it’s an economic necessity.”

Beyond that, the strategy “shows no commitment to the government’s legal obligation to meet its 2030 GHG reduction targets” said sustainability expert Bob Willard.

Even given Carney’s emphasis on “results, not targets”, the strategy falls short, Willard said. “For an economist and businessman, Carney should know better.”

In fact, the strategy includes plenty of references to targets, Willard said—they’re just thinly disguised as results, without dates attached.

“They provide a lot of wiggle room and room for interpretation, especially the emphasis on carbon ‘intensity’ reductions rather than on absolute reductions.”

The strategy acknowledges the need to cut emissions. It states:

“Lowering our emissions is critical to protecting the competitiveness of Canada’s oil and gas and steel sectors. Reducing emissions is not only essential for environmental reasons, but also a key factor in securing access to markets that prioritise sustainability. By becoming a global leader in clean technology and clean energy, Canada can strengthen its competitive advantage and expand its exports, particularly in sectors where low-carbon solutions are increasingly seen as a requirement rather than a bonus.”

At the same time, it paints an at-times conflicting picture of Canada’s global status, claiming “Canada’s natural resources, workforce, and commitment to fighting climate change position us to surpass economies that fail to adapt,” while including data that seems to reflect a less positive position. GHG emissions from oil and gas production in Canada, according to this chart from the report, are among the highest globally, contrary to the title of the chart.

The budget has left many wondering about the future of the emissions cap, which the government hints could become unnecessary down the road, but doesn’t outright eliminate.

The budget statement reaffirmed the government’s commitment to “bringing down the emissions associated with the production of oil and gas.”

“Effective carbon markets, enhanced oil and gas methane regulations, and the deployment at scale of technologies such as carbon capture and storage would create the circumstances whereby the oil and gas emissions cap would no longer be required as it would have marginal value in reducing emissions.”

Conor Curtis, head of communications at Sierra Club Canada said “people want clear regulations on big polluters.”

“The framing of the emissions cap by the government is straight from the oil and gas corporations, and it’s both wrong and bad communications,” he said.

He said polling shows there’s nothing to suggest the emissions cap is truly controversial in Canada and there is a lot of support for climate action.

“Following the Alberta Government’s unsuccessful campaign against the emissions cap, polling showed the majority of Canadians were aware of the policy, and 67% thought the emissions cap would either make a significant or some impact on climate goals,” Curtis said

He said this is actually a “strength it has versus carbon pricing.” Sierra Club Canada’s position is that “Canadians want a well implemented policy and it’s time to put aside divisions and perfect the emissions cap.”

Curtis said even Albertans say it’s how the cap is implemented that’s important, with as many as 51% of support hinging on the implementation. In Atlantic Canada, 78% either support or say it’s a matter of implementation.

Joe Vipond of the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment (CAPE) quipped, “is there any chance the cancelling of the emissions cap will be offset by strengthening the Industrial carbon price? or am I in dream lala land.”

The Mix received a heartening message from Seth Klein and Bushra Asghar of the Climate Emergency Unit:

“After many years of campaigning, we are relieved and heartened to see the Youth Climate Corps (YCC) established in Budget 2025, with a commitment of $40 million over two years. This is a win for hundreds of young activists and allies who have pressed hard for this idea, especially in the context of a budget that is significantly retreating on climate and decreasing overall program spending. But notably, $20 million a year will only produce about 350 full-time jobs for the whole country, which is not terribly consequential for tackling the skyrocketing youth unemployment or addressing the climate crisis. Today’s announcement is a far cry from the $1 billion annual investment our campaign has called for, but it gets our foot in the door to prove the YCC’s worth. So we will roll up our sleeves and work with the government to up the ambition for a Youth Climate Corps that matches the generational challenge.”

George P.R. Benson, senior manager for economic development at the Zero Emissions Innovation Centre said he was nervous to see what’s in store for Canada’s greenwashing rules. “They’re saying they will remove some of the “confusing” aspects of the Competition Act that they just went through the whole process of updating,” Benson said, adding he’ll be tracking what the government removes from the guidelines.

“Today’s weakening of greenwashing rules is more than just a problem for the climate, it is a problem for the security of our democracy,” Conor Curtis, head of communications at Sierra Club Canada, said in a statement he posted to the chat.

Curtis said that the spread of disinformation and climate denial—purposely spread by oil and gas corporations—is contributing to a breakdown of democratic processes in the United States.

“Canada needs strong regulations to ensure that oil and gas corporations—who have large sums of money to spend on influence—are held to the highest possible standard of truthfulness.”

The Energy Mix publisher shared a missive from the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment (CAPE), highlighting its key budget takeaways, including one on the Competition Act.

Greenwashing Risks: Removing the Competition Act amendments lets polluters mislead people in Canada and undermines truly sustainable businesses.

Matt Price, Executive Director, Investors for Paris Compliance said in a statement: “The government’s proposal to weaken greenwashing provisions means more investor risk, particularly given the reluctance of provincial securities regulators to enforce accurate and complete disclosure in climate matters.”

Ecojustice’s Karine Peloffy sent out a statement calling for the passage of the Climate-Aligned Finance Act reintroduced in Senate last week. “A failure to implement stronger rules to safeguard the financial and climate systems could open the door to litigation, as illustrated by the recent case against CPP Investments alleging climate-related financial risk mismanagement,” Peloffy said.

“The government should not remove the ability for Canadians to bring allegations of greenwashing directly to the Competition Tribunal, as is proposed in the budget,” Ecojustice lawyer Tanya Jemec said in a statement. “This would leave anti-greenwashing enforcement to the Competition Bureau, which has limited capacity, expertise, and resources.”

Gordon More, executive director of Southeast Techhub in Estevan, Saskatchewan was looking for new funding specifically targeting rural Canada and found none.

He commented that this is “where every single one of these nation building projects will be built.”

“Where do they think the labour force will come from? How will people who don’t have any access to technology training be able to help build, maintain and operate these facilities?” asked More.

He added that it’s “far cheaper to provide rural Canada with the tech training, then to import the skills from elsewhere.”

Luisa Da Silva, executive director at Iron & Earth said she wass “waiting to hear what will move the needle on real affordability for individuals.”

More said the new $1 billion fund-of-funds program is “huge” and will help prevent companies from leaving Canada.

“It also announces a new intellectual property performance review aimed at finding ways to ‘increase domestic investment in leading and high-potential firms’ and ‘help firms protect and commercialise their intellectual property in foreign markets,’” he added, quoting from the budget document.

Bryan Watson, managing director, CleanTech North said he’ll be interested to see how this new program rolls out.

Da Silva asked how vulnerable persons would benefit from the budget. She said she was hoping to see real affordability that “trickles down” to those most vulnerable persons.

“A lot of what has been said here perhaps sounds good for those in urban areas, for those who specialize or for those with professional designations,” she said, “but what about the vulnerable people, or those having a broad set of skills benefits their communities?”

Da Silva is concerned about people in small communities, and rural communities who “wear several hats like sitting on their local council, being the town plumber, and/or holding other unofficial posts.”

“Community resilience is stronger than the individual,” Da Silva said.

Instead of just building more houses, the government must tackle how people access the funding to purchase a home, she suggested. “The government can create a multitude of affordability there that goes beyond the first time home buyers incentives that are completely out of touch with today’s housing prices.”

When the current affordability crisis isn’t mentioned, those experiencing hardships feel forgotten, she added.

More said he’s disappointed there’s “nothing for rural, nothing for Saskatchewan.”

“I hope I am missing something between the lines. I know there is more to it than this document. But I do worry that there is no ‘healing’ mechanism, we are once again left out.”

He said he was just hoping the prime minister would do something different and now wonders if the Conservatives will vote against the budget, adding, an election is “the last thing we need.”

Responding to the budget statement on “expanding the Union Training and Innovation Program to boost union-based apprenticeship training in the Red Seal trades,” Abhilash Kantamneni of the Heating, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Institute of Canada (HRAI) pointed out “a lot of skilled trades in the clean economy are not unionized (HVAC contractors, for example)”.

And the mention of that support resulting from a 15% savings target over three years coming from a “targeted recalibration of its programs and its approach to delivering them” “sounds “ominous,” Kantamneni said.

Meanwhile, Gordon More, executive director of Southeast Techhub in Estevan, Saskatchewan noted that “funding for labour force development continues to go to urban centres” rather than rural.

“For example, SaskPolytech wants to build the Nuclear Training Facility in Saskatoon—a five-hour trip, one way, from where the actual reactors will be located. When it comes to innovation hubs, almost every budget dollar also goes to urban incubation centres.”

A more effective approach, More said, would be to give Rural Economic Development “an actual budget that can only be spent on economic development for rural regions”.

With major projects planned primarily in rural areas, communities will need funding, resources, and training to handle the massive changes they’ll experience.

“Who’s going to house, feed, police, and provide medical services when you drop 2,500 workers into a community of 10,000 to build one of these projects?”

Carney campaigned on using a new fiscal management framework that splits operational and capital expenditures, George P.R. Benson, senior manager for economic development at the Zero Emissions Innovation Centre, said earlier today. “It’s more or less what it says on the tin—split out more clearly the stuff we build versus the stuff we operate.”

The Parliamentary budget office (PBO) likes this format, Benson added, but it is nervous about the breadth the government is proposing.

It wrote: “Finance Canada acknowledges the breadth of its definition and noted its intent to focus on spending classified as capital investments that would meet conditionality and identifiability criteria.

Finance Canada also identifies 6 categories of federal government spending that would be classified as capital investment.Finance Canada’s definition and categories expand the scope of capital investment beyond the current treatment of capital spending in the Public Accounts of Canada.1 Based on our initial assessment, we find that the scope is overly expansive and exceeds international practice such as that adopted by the United Kingdom.

Specifically, the inclusion of corporate income tax expenditures, operating (production) subsidies and measures to grow the housing stock likely overstate the actual contribution of federal government spending to non-residential capital formation in the economy. That is, federal spending under these categories represents the fiscal cost of related measures and not necessarily the amount of non-residential capital formation that will be undertaken in the economy because of these measures.”

Benson interprets the last line,as the PBO effectively saying: “building housing is good politics, and indeed stimulates investment, but that’s not the same as building wealth-generating infrastructure.”

“The ‘housing-as-investment’ mindset is still a tricky one to break, even if the government owns the assets at the end of the day, Benson said.

Ana Gonzalez Guerrero, an expert on climate finance for municipalities, responded to Benson saying that her concern is “where we are building houses and how much is resilience integrated as a key building principle, because building without resilience in mind is not only hard to justify as “wealth-generating”, but will become incredibly expensive.”

Disappointment and frustration were common themes among climate champions and experts who joined The Energy Mix for an online chat this afternoon and evening about the new federal budget or shared their comments from elsewhere with us.

“My first take is that neither the tone nor the measures reflect a sense of urgency with regard to climate change, except to the extent there are business opportunities that might be missed,” said Ralph Torrie, research director of Corporate Knights.

Curtis said even Albertans say it’s how the cap is implemented that’s important, with as many as 51% of support hinging on the implementation. In Atlantic Canada, 78% either support or say it’s a matter of implementation.

Joe Vipond of the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment (CAPE) quipped, “is there any chance the cancelling of the emissions cap will be offset by strengthening the Industrial carbon price? or am I in dream lala land.”

The Mix received a heartening message from Seth Klein and Bushra Asghar of the Climate Emergency Unit:

“After many years of campaigning, we are relieved and heartened to see the Youth Climate Corps (YCC) established in Budget 2025, with a commitment of $40 million over two years. This is a win for hundreds of young activists and allies who have pressed hard for this idea, especially in the context of a budget that is significantly retreating on climate and decreasing overall program spending. But notably, $20 million a year will only produce about 350 full-time jobs for the whole country, which is not terribly consequential for tackling the skyrocketing youth unemployment or addressing the climate crisis. Today’s announcement is a far cry from the $1 billion annual investment our campaign has called for, but it gets our foot in the door to prove the YCC’s worth. So we will roll up our sleeves and work with the government to up the ambition for a Youth Climate Corps that matches the generational challenge.”

George P.R. Benson, senior manager for economic development at the Zero Emissions Innovation Centre said he was nervous to see what’s in store for Canada’s greenwashing rules. “They’re saying they will remove some of the “confusing” aspects of the Competition Act that they just went through the whole process of updating,” Benson said, adding he’ll be tracking what the government removes from the guidelines.

“Today’s weakening of greenwashing rules is more than just a problem for the climate, it is a problem for the security of our democracy,” Conor Curtis, head of communications at Sierra Club Canada, said in a statement he posted to the chat.

Curtis said that the spread of disinformation and climate denial—purposely spread by oil and gas corporations—is contributing to a breakdown of democratic processes in the United States.

“Canada needs strong regulations to ensure that oil and gas corporations—who have large sums of money to spend on influence—are held to the highest possible standard of truthfulness.”

The Energy Mix publisher shared a missive from the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment (CAPE), highlighting its key budget takeaways, including one on the Competition Act.

Greenwashing Risks: Removing the Competition Act amendments lets polluters mislead people in Canada and undermines truly sustainable businesses.

Matt Price, Executive Director, Investors for Paris Compliance said in a statement: “The government’s proposal to weaken greenwashing provisions means more investor risk, particularly given the reluctance of provincial securities regulators to enforce accurate and complete disclosure in climate matters.”

Ecojustice’s Karine Peloffy sent out a statement calling for the passage of the Climate-Aligned Finance Act reintroduced in Senate last week. “A failure to implement stronger rules to safeguard the financial and climate systems could open the door to litigation, as illustrated by the recent case against CPP Investments alleging climate-related financial risk mismanagement,” Peloffy said.

“The government should not remove the ability for Canadians to bring allegations of greenwashing directly to the Competition Tribunal, as is proposed in the budget,” Ecojustice lawyer Tanya Jemec said in a statement. “This would leave anti-greenwashing enforcement to the Competition Bureau, which has limited capacity, expertise, and resources.”

Gordon More, executive director of Southeast Techhub in Estevan, Saskatchewan was looking for new funding specifically targeting rural Canada and found none.

He commented that this is “where every single one of these nation building projects will be built.”

“Where do they think the labour force will come from? How will people who don’t have any access to technology training be able to help build, maintain and operate these facilities?” asked More.

He added that it’s “far cheaper to provide rural Canada with the tech training, then to import the skills from elsewhere.”

Luisa Da Silva, executive director at Iron & Earth said she wass “waiting to hear what will move the needle on real affordability for individuals.”

More said the new $1 billion fund-of-funds program is “huge” and will help prevent companies from leaving Canada.

“It also announces a new intellectual property performance review aimed at finding ways to ‘increase domestic investment in leading and high-potential firms’ and ‘help firms protect and commercialise their intellectual property in foreign markets,’” he added, quoting from the budget document.

Bryan Watson, managing director, CleanTech North said he’ll be interested to see how this new program rolls out.

Da Silva asked how vulnerable persons would benefit from the budget. She said she was hoping to see real affordability that “trickles down” to those most vulnerable persons.

“A lot of what has been said here perhaps sounds good for those in urban areas, for those who specialize or for those with professional designations,” she said, “but what about the vulnerable people, or those having a broad set of skills benefits their communities?”

Da Silva is concerned about people in small communities, and rural communities who “wear several hats like sitting on their local council, being the town plumber, and/or holding other unofficial posts.”

“Community resilience is stronger than the individual,” Da Silva said.

Instead of just building more houses, the government must tackle how people access the funding to purchase a home, she suggested. “The government can create a multitude of affordability there that goes beyond the first time home buyers incentives that are completely out of touch with today’s housing prices.”

When the current affordability crisis isn’t mentioned, those experiencing hardships feel forgotten, she added.

More said he’s disappointed there’s “nothing for rural, nothing for Saskatchewan.”

“I hope I am missing something between the lines. I know there is more to it than this document. But I do worry that there is no ‘healing’ mechanism, we are once again left out.”

He said he was just hoping the prime minister would do something different and now wonders if the Conservatives will vote against the budget, adding, an election is “the last thing we need.”

Responding to the budget statement on “expanding the Union Training and Innovation Program to boost union-based apprenticeship training in the Red Seal trades,” Abhilash Kantamneni of the Heating, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Institute of Canada (HRAI) pointed out “a lot of skilled trades in the clean economy are not unionized (HVAC contractors, for example)”.

And the mention of that support resulting from a 15% savings target over three years coming from a “targeted recalibration of its programs and its approach to delivering them” “sounds “ominous,” Kantamneni said.

Meanwhile, Gordon More, executive director of Southeast Techhub in Estevan, Saskatchewan noted that “funding for labour force development continues to go to urban centres” rather than rural.

“For example, SaskPolytech wants to build the Nuclear Training Facility in Saskatoon—a five-hour trip, one way, from where the actual reactors will be located. When it comes to innovation hubs, almost every budget dollar also goes to urban incubation centres.”

A more effective approach, More said, would be to give Rural Economic Development “an actual budget that can only be spent on economic development for rural regions”.

With major projects planned primarily in rural areas, communities will need funding, resources, and training to handle the massive changes they’ll experience.

“Who’s going to house, feed, police, and provide medical services when you drop 2,500 workers into a community of 10,000 to build one of these projects?”

Carney campaigned on using a new fiscal management framework that splits operational and capital expenditures, George P.R. Benson, senior manager for economic development at the Zero Emissions Innovation Centre, said earlier today. “It’s more or less what it says on the tin—split out more clearly the stuff we build versus the stuff we operate.”

The Parliamentary budget office (PBO) likes this format, Benson added, but it is nervous about the breadth the government is proposing.

It wrote: “Finance Canada acknowledges the breadth of its definition and noted its intent to focus on spending classified as capital investments that would meet conditionality and identifiability criteria.

Finance Canada also identifies 6 categories of federal government spending that would be classified as capital investment.Finance Canada’s definition and categories expand the scope of capital investment beyond the current treatment of capital spending in the Public Accounts of Canada.1 Based on our initial assessment, we find that the scope is overly expansive and exceeds international practice such as that adopted by the United Kingdom.

Specifically, the inclusion of corporate income tax expenditures, operating (production) subsidies and measures to grow the housing stock likely overstate the actual contribution of federal government spending to non-residential capital formation in the economy. That is, federal spending under these categories represents the fiscal cost of related measures and not necessarily the amount of non-residential capital formation that will be undertaken in the economy because of these measures.”

Benson interprets the last line,as the PBO effectively saying: “building housing is good politics, and indeed stimulates investment, but that’s not the same as building wealth-generating infrastructure.”

“The ‘housing-as-investment’ mindset is still a tricky one to break, even if the government owns the assets at the end of the day, Benson said.

Ana Gonzalez Guerrero, an expert on climate finance for municipalities, responded to Benson saying that her concern is “where we are building houses and how much is resilience integrated as a key building principle, because building without resilience in mind is not only hard to justify as “wealth-generating”, but will become incredibly expensive.”",https://www.theenergymix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/election-canada.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 11:58:22.293501

That commitment remained at the forefront in 2025 as Cornerstone and its site companies at Cornerstone Energy Park (CEP) invested in local schools and neighborhood initiatives designed to support both the local community and the regional economy.

Throughout the year, CEP focused on modernization, positioning the site for sustainable operations and continued investment. Alongside co-locating site companies, Cornerstone makes in-demand products that increase the longevity of everyday goods, including vehicles and lumber, and processes like water purification and diesel emission abatement. In creating these products, Cornerstone and its site companies aim to reduce their environmental footprint while prioritizing the health and safety of their employees and community.

One major milestone in 2025 was the groundbreaking for a $500 million manufacturing facility for the CEP site company UBE C1 Chemicals America (UCCA).

“UCCA is proud to work alongside cosponsors who share our commitment to community investment and to building relationships with our neighbors. Through this year’s activities, we had meaningful opportunities to strengthen connections within the Waggaman community and continue building relationships that deliver lasting value for the region,” said UCCA President and CEO Tom Yura.

During the groundbreaking ceremony, Yura also announced $50,000 in continued community investments to local organizations.

“UCCA represents exactly the kind of thoughtful, long-term investment we work to attract to Cornerstone Energy Park,” said Jacques Byrd, vice president of site development at Cornerstone. “By announcing direct community investments at the groundbreaking, UCCA underscored that this facility is committed to being a responsible and engaged neighbor in the communities where we live and work.”

That community commitment from Cornerstone and its CEP co-locating companies was seen time and again in tangible ways. When there was a major holiday on the calendar, the companies were there – distributing Easter goodie bags at the Waggaman Community Foundation Easter Egg Hunt, participating in neighborhood Halloween celebrations and providing more than 800 goodie bags to local organizations, restocking shelves with food donations to the South Kenner Food Bank ahead of Thanksgiving, providing meals for the Little Zion Baptist Church Community Thanksgiving Luncheon, contributing to the Waggaman Community Foundation’s River Road Christmas Party and supporting the Live Oak Fire Department Christmas Parade and Party.

Beyond seasonal events, CEP site companies also supported broader civic and community-building efforts in 2025, including:

Through its Cornerstone Scholarship Program, the company awarded 10 eligible local students with $1,000 scholarships to pursue STEM-related degrees at accredited institutions. Another three students received sponsorships to attend the Louisiana Youth Seminar, a weeklong summer camp for high schoolers to develop skills in leadership, communication, goal-setting, team-building, problem-solving and more. And, female high school students were able to connect with women currently working in industrial careers thanks in part to Cornerstone’s participation in the Women in Industry Forum hosted by the New Orleans Region Industry Alliance.

As Cornerstone leaders look ahead to 2026, they view responsible corporate citizenship as an ongoing commitment to listening to community needs and taking meaningful action to strengthen the place where its employees live and work.

He has approved a 90-day pause in offshore wind projects off Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York and Virginia.
Katharine Kollins, president of the nonprofit Southeastern Wind Coalition headquartered in Chapel Hill, is skeptical about the Trump administration’s claim that national security issues are behind the sudden stoppage of wind power projects.
Josh Stein should push to continue the extensive planning and testing needed to expand wind power in North Carolina.
By the time Trump leaves office, North Carolina should be ready to go with the wind.","President Donald Trump’s move this week to pause five major offshore wind power projects won’t affect North Carolina directly, but it represents another setback for tapping one of the greatest wind energy resources on the East Coast.

North Carolina should be among the nation’s leaders in harnessing its strong coastal winds offshore and onshore to generate electricity. Getting there has been stymied by opposition from coastal communities, military and environmental concerns, and a lack of commitment from the state’s largest utility, Duke Energy.

But those issues can be overcome. Offshore wind turbines would be so far off the coast as to be barely visible. Turbine locations can accommodate military concerns about flight paths and radar interference. Offshore turbines elsewhere have not presented environmental threats. Duke Energy, facing growing demands for electricity and pressure to reduce carbon emissions, could see the value of adding more wind power.

That potential turnaround is now further off as Trump has declared war on wind power. He has approved a 90-day pause in offshore wind projects off Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York and Virginia. Some were near completion and all are badly needed.

The pause, ostensibly ordered out of national security concerns, may lead to an extended stoppage. That would not only cost developers of the existing projects, but it would scare off potential investors in future projects.

Katharine Kollins, president of the nonprofit Southeastern Wind Coalition headquartered in Chapel Hill, is skeptical about the Trump administration’s claim that national security issues are behind the sudden stoppage of wind power projects.

“I can’t imagine there’s any validity to it, given the extensive process all these have gone through,” she said. “There are no surprises like that that just come up.”

Kollins noted that China has erected extensive fields of offshore wind turbines without concerns about interference with its defense systems.

Companies that have invested in wind power will go to court to end the stoppage, Kollins said. “I have no doubt that lawsuits will follow,” she said. “There is $30 billion in investment on the line. Companies aren’t going to say, ‘OK.’ ”

Dominion Energy, the utility developing a large wind farm off Virginia, has already filed a complaint in federal court.

What’s really driving the shutdown is Trump’s support of the fossil fuel industry and his personal dislike for wind power. He unsuccessfully sought to block wind turbines near one of his golf courses in Scotland and has repeatedly attacked the “windmills” as unsightly and a hazard to birds.

Trump is letting his bias undermine what should be his first concern – reducing the cost of living. The rapid growth of data centers to support AI development has ramped up the demand for electricity and is putting upward pressure on electricity rates. Adding new sources of electricity would help utilities meet that rising demand and while holding down rates.

While wind power has long been heralded as a way to reduce the use of fossil fuels in power plants, it’s now being recommended as an additional source under an “all the above” approach to electricity generation.

“What has happened is that utilities find themselves in a place where they need every electron they can get,” Kollins said.

Wind power complements solar power among renewable energy sources. While solar power is at its best during sunny days, wind blows stronger at night and during stormy weather.

Beyond its fit among energy sources, wind power also generates construction jobs and has spurred the building of specialized large ships to carry huge turbine parts and lay cable.

The benefits of land-based wind farms are already being realized in North Carolina. The Timbermill wind farm has 45 turbines spread over 6,000 acres in Chowan County in the state’s northeastern corner. It is now the county’s largest single taxpayer even as its presence allows most of the land to still be used for crops.

Trump’s tantrum against wind power means more counties won’t be seeing its benefits. But Gov. Josh Stein should push to continue the extensive planning and testing needed to expand wind power in North Carolina.

UNDERSTANDING THE PROPOSED WOTUS RULE On Nov. 17, 2025, the Trump administration proposed a new WOTUS definition that implements the Sackett decision and upholds congressional intent under the CWA.","For years, farmers and ranchers have worked their land with a close eye on the weather, volatile markets, farm policy and the many regulations that shape everyday business decisions. Among the most influential, and often most confusing of these rules, is the definition of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS). Over the past decade, frequent regulatory changes and court decisions have left many farmers questioning what WOTUS really means for their operations. From the start of this debate, the American Farm Bureau Federation has been the leading voice across industry sectors, consistently advocating for clear, practical regulations that protect farmers while ensuring environmental stewardship.

EVOLVING DEFINITION

Under the Clean Water Act, the term WOTUS serves as the threshold that determines which water bodies fall under federal jurisdiction. Unfortunately, the statute offers little clarity on where that jurisdictional line should be drawn. Over the years, the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the agencies) have exploited this ambiguity, expanding their authority far beyond what Congress intended when drafting the law.

From the mid-1980s onward, the agencies operated under a regulatory definition that broadly interpreted WOTUS to include many waters. This expansive interpretation repeatedly ran up against judicial scrutiny. The Supreme Court’s decisions on the limits of the federal government’s regulatory reach, in cases such as Riverside Bayview Homes, Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County, and Rapanos, often created more questions than answers.

For example, the Supreme Court’s 4-1-4 split in Rapanos created conflicting standards for federal jurisdiction. Justice Antonin Scalia’s plurality introduced the “relatively permanent waters” test, while Justice Anthony Kennedy’s concurrence advanced the “significant nexus” test. With no majority opinion, this fractured guidance left regulators and courts without a clear rule, fueling years of litigation and inconsistent interpretations as successive administrations struggled to define WOTUS.

Beginning in 2015, the regulatory uncertainty was exacerbated as different presidential administrations attempted to make sweeping changes, creating a swinging pendulum of regulations. Consequently, the definition of WOTUS became a legal and regulatory maze — one in which wetlands, ditches, seasonal streams, drainage features or even ephemeral streams (low spots in a farm field) could be regulated. Over the last decade, there have been five different rulemakings on WOTUS. The ping-ponging of definitions has produced anxiety and uncertainty for farmers and ranchers whose decisions on the farm depend heavily on clear rules.

SACKETT V. EPA: A TURNING POINT

The 2023 Supreme Court decision in Sackett v. EPA marked one of the most consequential shifts in federal water regulations since the passage of the CWA. This decision greatly narrowed the types of water features and wetlands regulated as a WOTUS and simplified compliance for landowners. The Supreme Court accomplished this by unanimously eliminating the troubling “significant nexus” test, which allowed the federal government to set up a case-by-case regulatory regime that expanded their jurisdictional reach beyond legal boundaries.

Additionally, the ruling greatly restricted the types of wetlands that fall under federal authority by providing proper guardrails for “adjacent wetland.” Farmers and ranchers across the country praised the court’s decision because it is the clearest, most decisive legal standard for WOTUS in decades and appropriately reigns in the federal government’s authority.

UNDERSTANDING THE PROPOSED WOTUS RULE

On Nov. 17, 2025, the Trump administration proposed a new WOTUS definition that implements the Sackett decision and upholds congressional intent under the CWA. The rule represents the greatest narrowing of the federal government’s jurisdictional reach over private property. As directed by the Supreme Court, the proposal only regulates water bodies that are “relatively permanent” — meaning surface waters that flow or stand year-round or those that flow throughout the wet season — and wetlands that are directly abutting a regulated tributary and have a continuous surface connection.

As an example, features like isolated ponds, field-edge depressions, disconnected wetlands, groundwater and many ditches or prior-converted cropland would be excluded. The rule also proposes to define key terms (like “tributary,” “ditch,” “prior converted cropland,” etc.) to bring consistency and predictability to what is “in” and what is “out.” This also reduces the amount of land subject to the regulation, cutting down regulatory costs across the industry.

Most importantly, this rule shifts the burden of proof away from the landowner and places this responsibility squarely on the federal government, meaning a farmer no longer must prove that they do not have a WOTUS on their property to use their land.

It is critical to recognize that this rule upholds the cooperative federalism objective of the CWA by allowing states to serve as the primary authority in regulating water. State governments can regulate far beyond the definition of WOTUS and impose their own, more stringent rules. In many states, just because a water feature is not regulated by the federal government, does not necessarily mean that it goes unregulated.

While this rule is an important step forward in creating a legally durable definition of WOTUS, implementation of the rule may present some challenges. One potential hurdle for some landowners will be determining if there is sustained flow throughout the wet season. In some instances, field-level data may need to be collected, which could significantly slow down the jurisdictional determination process. This also impedes farmers’ ability to use their land, potentially cutting their production and revenue capacity.

COST OF COMPLIANCE

Ensuring compliance under WOTUS for farmers can include several major components that impact a farmer’s cost of production:

Obtaining Clean Water Act federal permits for activities like fencing, drainage or pond construction;

Hiring consultants and technical experts for wetland determinations;

Experiencing operational delays while waiting for permit approvals; and

The cost of mitigation activities which can often be substantial.

Because Clean Water Act compliance carries significant civil and criminal liabilities — up to $64,000 per day or even jail time — it is critical that farmers fully understand the rules to avoid inadvertent violations.

Farmers care about the definition of WOTUS because it determines which ditches, wetlands and water features on their land fall under federal regulation — and therefore which everyday activities may require permits, carry compliance obligations or expose them to legal risk and regulatory costs to ensure compliance. Whether they are installing tile, building a fence, cleaning out a ditch, expanding cropland or managing drainage after heavy rains, the scope of WOTUS directly influences what farmers can do without federal oversight.

The Future of the Automotive Industry The easing of European requirements has served as a call to action for Valladolid.
In the coming years, Valladolid will become one of the key sites for testing new technological solutions in the automotive industry.","In Valladolid, the automotive industry is at a pivotal moment. European authorities have eased requirements for the transition to electric vehicles, providing much-needed relief to local businesses and thousands of families whose livelihoods depend on the city’s factories. Mayor Jesús Julio Carnero openly expresses his satisfaction: these changes have arrived just as the region is launching major projects to introduce new technologies in the automotive sector.

In recent months, Valladolid has seen several major investment proposals. Chinese company Gotion plans to build a massive battery manufacturing plant here, while Horse has already announced a €71 million investment to develop hybrid systems at its facility. Regional authorities have declared this project a priority to safeguard more than 9,000 jobs, with nearly 2,300 at the plant itself and the rest in related industries.

Investment and jobs

The European Union’s decision to relax environmental requirements from 2035 followed lengthy discussions. Valladolid officials had insisted from the outset on a flexible approach to prevent mass layoffs and the erosion of industrial potential. In September, the city took the initiative to support competitive climate neutrality in the automotive sector, and this approach has now received endorsement at the European level.

In the coming years, not only electric vehicles but also other low-emission technologies will develop in Valladolid: hybrid engines, hydrogen, biofuels, and synthetic fuels. This will preserve market diversity, offer consumers more choices, and give businesses time to adapt.

Industrial potential

The automotive industry is key to the economy of Castilla y León. It accounts for 10% of the region’s GDP and half of its exports. In addition to Valladolid, major car plants operate in Burgos and Ávila. In recent years, the region has actively attracted investments, including from Germany, where demand for Spanish cars and components is rising.

Renault’s Valladolid facility has already started producing new models, including hybrid versions. A new car rolls off the production line every minute, and expansion plans focus on further introducing eco-friendly technologies. Regional authorities have extended Renault’s priority investment project status through 2026 to support modernization and jobs.

Policy and competition

European Parliament member Raúl de la Hoz attended the meeting with auto industry representatives, noting that European decisions are opening new opportunities for the sector. He said previous strict requirements could have triggered a crisis and hurt competitiveness, but now companies have a chance for a smoother transition to new standards.

At the same time, disagreements persist in Spain between the central government and regional authorities. Madrid continues to push for a complete ban on internal combustion engines by 2035, while regional governments and industry leaders are calling for a more flexible approach. Valladolid and Castilla y León advocate for protecting jobs and industrial capacity without giving up on environmental goals.

The Future of the Automotive Industry

The easing of European requirements has served as a call to action for Valladolid. New investments in hybrid technology development have already been approved, and battery production and plant modernization projects have been granted priority status. This will not only support jobs but also enable the region to maintain its leading position in the Spanish and European automotive sectors.

In the coming years, Valladolid will become one of the key sites for testing new technological solutions in the automotive industry. Here, traditional manufacturing facilities will be combined with innovative approaches to reducing emissions, giving the city and region a chance for sustainable development in a changing market.",https://russpain.com/wp-content/smush-webp/2025/12/f.elconfidencial.com_original_a5e_376_246_a5e376246e50d577587e0ed183869bc6-1-1-780x470.jpg.webp,N,,2025-12-28 10:59:45.165172

• Leader & Times

The Liberal City Commission and some members of the community got to hear about an exciting economic development opportunity making its way to Liberal from overseas.

Seward County Development Corporation Executive Director Eli Svaty gave an update to the commission at its most recent meeting last Tuesday evening.

“I actually first would like to apologize for it taking so long to get to this point, I feel like this announcement could have come many months ago – in fact, this was announced in Taiwan back in September,” Svaty began with a chuckle. “If you'll recall, we had a couple projects ready to go last spring, but then they fell apart, so forgive me for being slightly gun-shy with this project and making sure everything was actually in place. This project is a really unexpected opportunity for Liberal. For more than a year now, Scarlette [Diseker] and Jose [Lara] and I have been working with a company out of Taiwan, and in early conversations, we were sitting there thinking 'Why would THIS come to Liberal?' and then as time kept going and the visits kept happening, there was that sense of this project being a great opportunity for the community. In that part of the world, they manufacture pretty much everything, and right now, there's a big push in Taiwan to get some of that manufacturing out for a number of reasons. One reason is tariffs, and another reason is the threat of China, and another reason is that need to be made in the U.S. and a desire to access our markets. As it so happens, we came into contact with one of those companies a little more than a year ago, and we've since been working with them to make that a reality. What's really remarkable is one of the first visits the company's leadership team made was at Pancake Day, which was cold and cloudy and super windy – however, that did not deter them, and they've since made multiple visits when the weather's been much more agreeable.”

Svaty then gave more of the logistical information about where everything will be set up.

“1600 W. Pancake Blvd. is going to be the home of Apogee Power, and they are an advanced manufacturing company for batteries and energy storage systems. Liberal will be the company's first U.S.-based manufacturing of that, and things will happen in three different phases – a Hybrid Power Unit (HPU), a Ground Power Unit, and then the big-scale energy storage systems,” Svaty said. “The building at 1600 W. Pancake Blvd. will be the operations center where they'll do all the marketing, promotion/sales, warehousing and logistics, and the actual cell components will still be manufactured in Taiwan and then sent here, and then the manufacturing base will be where everything is compiled and assembled into the different units. Those operations will be run out of the building at 1600 W. Pancake Blvd. The building has some significant upgrades it will need to undergo like static-free floors and clean rooms and upgrades to the ventilation systems and all of that. I'm really excited to get that building filled and in use and provide them with the space they need.”

Apogee is also certainly no stranger to the energy world, Svaty continued.

“Apogee has been around a long time, and they have locations in Taiwan, Vietnam, and they have sales operations out of Japan, Cambodia, Indonesia, and multiple other parts of Asia. They supply batteries for agricultural equipment from Kubota and other machinery in Asia,” Svaty said. “This company has been contracting in the U.S. for more than 20 years, primarily with the Department of Defense, and because of the quality of their products, they have technology that helps keep them explosion-proof and fireproof, and they also work significantly with the mining industry. I greatly appreciate City of Liberal leadership from the past year, it's been a great opportunity because so much of this is built on that relationship. This is not a typical project for Southwest Kansas, and I know the state is excited because they've been trying to get something out of Taiwan for a while, and we're leading that charge. The initial plan is 20 to 30 jobs and expanding to around 70 within the first couple years, and those jobs will come from our base and bring in people from around the area. Their engineers will come over and train the people and bring everyone up to speed. This is a great way to start showing even somewhere like Liberal can have a global impact and work with companies from around the world. Even more exciting is from the beginning, they said they know of other companies who want to set up operations in the U.S. We are happy to provide that home for this company in Liberal – they need to move some of their manufacturing and need a protected place in the U.S., and we're very excited. We're excited to see this project come to life and see what else they could bring to the table.”

Others also praised the project.

“Liberal definitely has some helpful attributes, such as being centralized, and we've always discussed how we could sell that. This company really liked that, and we also have a bit of security from the coast, which they noticed,” Liberal Mayor Jose Lara said. “At the end of the day, we also get something from the eastern side of the state and the relationships we've fostered there. Having the building available was also very beneficial, and that could lead to other conversations with other potential businesses to set up.”

“There's one of the guys on the Taiwan team I've only met once, but you could really sense the strength of the relationship that was built, and all of this came together because of that relationship,” Commissioner Jeff Parsons added. “Also, we really seemed to be in just the right situation for everything to come together, and I think the strength of this relationship is what's going to help us with attracting other companies that might come after Apogee. It was also really gratifying to see the excitement they have about coming to this part of the world, so kudos to everyone involved with this and all the hard work it took to get everything going.”

“I really think this reinforces the spirit of Liberal and how this truly is the friendliest city in the U.S., and I also have to thank everyone involved for all of their hard work,” Commissioner Janeth Vazquez said.

In other new business, the commission approved a contract and changes with French Construction for the Doll Addition, and also approved Resolution No. 2447 concerning the adoption of the Kansas Homeland Security Region D Local Hazard Mitigation Plan.

The commission also approved minor updates to the Housing Grant Programs funded by the 1-Cent Sales Tax and updated 2026 Facade Grant guidelines, and concluded the meeting’s new business by approving utility billing waivers for Stepping Stone Shelter in the amount of $2,079.98.",https://liberalfirst.com/images/2025/December/Apogee%20Liberal%20location%20courtesy%20photo.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 11:13:28.129723

The partnership in developing renewable energy-based power plant projects is aimed at ensuring that green projects not only obtain financing but are also developed in a planned, integrated manner that is in line with the needs of the national electricity system.

Chief Executive Officer of Danantara Indonesia, Pandu Sjahrir, on Monday, 22 December, emphasised that Danantara’s role in this collaboration goes beyond that of a mere fund provider. According to him, Danantara is also actively involved in identifying various challenges in the development of renewable energy projects, ranging from financing aspects and project readiness to integration with the electricity system.

According to Pandu, this approach is necessary so that the development of new and renewable energy (NRE) does not proceed sporadically, but rather has a clear and sustainable framework. With targeted investment support, green power plant projects are expected to be realised on schedule and have a broad economic impact.

“With this approach, we want to ensure that the development of renewable energy can proceed in a more structured and timely manner, and be integrated with the needs of the national electricity system,” he said.

From the perspective of the electricity system operator, PLN Director-General Darmawan Prasodjo believes that collaboration with Danantara is a key factor in ensuring the sustainability of the energy transition. He emphasised that the transformation towards a clean energy system cannot be achieved by one institution alone, but requires synergy across stakeholders and long-term financial support.

“The energy transition cannot be done alone. Strong collaboration and solid, sustainable financial support are needed,” said Darmawan.

According to him, Danantara’s involvement strengthens PLN’s ability to realise renewable energy power plant projects listed in the Electricity Supply Business Plan (RUPTL). With more structured investment support, PLN is optimistic that the construction of green power plants can proceed according to target and support the reliability of the national electricity supply.

“The presence of Danantara Indonesia strengthens PLN’s efforts to develop renewable energy in a more structured manner, while ensuring that the green projects listed in the RUPTL can run on schedule and provide long-term benefits for the community and the national electricity system,” said Darmawan.

This collaboration is expected to become a model for financing and developing clean energy projects in the future, especially amid increasing investment needs to achieve national renewable energy mix targets. In addition to supporting emission reduction, the development of green power plants is also seen as an opportunity to create new jobs and strengthen Indonesia’s energy security in the long term.

While people living near these toxic coke oven facilities are breathing in poison every day, corporate polluters get another pass.","On Monday, multiple organizations filed a lawsuit challenging exemptions from President Donald Trump’s administration that would allow coke ovens to spew chemicals that lead to hazardous air pollution.

Involved organizations include the Environmental Law and Policy Center, EarthJustice, Just Transition Northwest Indiana, Hoosier Environmental Council and Sierra Club.

“This latest proclamation for coke ovens continues the Trump administration’s year-long practice of undermining industry’s compliance with toxic air pollutant standards by issuing meritless exemptions and delays,” Brian Lynk, senior attorney at the Environmental Law and Policy Center, said in a news release. “The communities who live with these plants and depend on clean and healthy air, in Northwest Indiana and around the country, deserve better.”

Coke ovens are used in steelmaking, heating coal to produce coke, which is used as a fuel. The ovens are a “major source of hazardous pollution,” according to the Environmental Law and Policy Center, which includes toxic chemicals and metals, including lead, mercury and benzene.

In November, Trump issued a proclamation providing regulatory relief for coke ovens nationwide, according to the White House, claiming that a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency coke oven rule places “severe burdens on the coke production industry” and affects American infrastructure, defense and national security.

“Many of the testing and monitoring requirements outlined in the coke oven rule rely on technologies that are not practically available, not demonstrated at the necessary scale, or cannot be implemented safely or consistently under real-world conditions,” the proclamation said. “Due to the coke oven rule’s onerous implementation and compliance schedule for these standards, many coke production facilities are in the impossible position of designing and engineering novel systems with unproven technology within a short time frame.”

It allows a two-year exemption to the coke oven rule because Trump claimed the technology doesn’t exist commercially and cannot allow corporations to comply with the rule. The Environmental Law and Policy Center claims that the exemption applied to more than 180 facilities across six industries, including Cleveland-Cliffs’ Indiana Harbor steel facility in East Chicago.

“The Trump administration is delivering another tough blow to local communities,” Tosh Sagar, senior attorney at EarthJustice, said in a news release. “These unlawful exemptions have real consequences for real people. While people living near these toxic coke oven facilities are breathing in poison every day, corporate polluters get another pass. Corporate profits should not come at the expense of public health.”

According to the Environmental Law and Policy Center, the EPA finalized revisions to the Clean Air Act that introduced the 2024 coke ovens rule, which “introduced a fenceline monitoring requirement, stricter limits on leaks from coke oven battery doors, lids and offtakes, and new emission standards for several hazardous air pollutants.”

Compliance deadlines were staggered between July 2025 and January 2026.

“Communities living near steel industry coke ovens advocated for many years for common-sense federal regulations to protect them from hazardous air pollution,” Haley Lewis, senior attorney for the Environmental Integrity Project, said in a news release. “The EPA’s 2024 rule requiring air monitoring and cleanup of dangerous levels of pollution from coke ovens would have provided meaningful improvements, had President Trump not granted an exemption last month. This exemption should be thrown out by the courts for the sake of the health of all the workers and families living near the industry.”",https://www.santacruzsentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ctc-l-CO2-Lippert019_218509974.jpg?w=1024&h=767,N,,2025-12-28 11:00:08.103461

A nearly $20 billion bombshell from Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) might have been the shoe drop the automotive industry was waiting to see.

The Trump administration has been busy introducing tariffs, reducing support for electric vehicles (EVs), and of course, removing the $7,500 federal tax credit for EV purchases. In part due to that, among other factors, the U.S. EV industry is expected to see a significant slowdown during the fourth quarter that will almost certainly extend into next year.

Because of these drastic shifts in demand and market potential, Ford just announced a $19.5 billion bombshell about its future ambitions. Here's what investors need to know.

What's going on?

It's tough to make a living selling EVs in the current environment, and after touting massive EV investment figures in recent years -- like much of the industry -- the Detroit automaker decided it was better to redistribute some of that investment to higher-return opportunities. This week, Ford announced a number of actions that are intended to refocus its Ford+ plan and drive profitable growth.

To take these actions, Ford expects to record roughly $19.5 billion in special items related to a restructuring and a pullback in its full-electric vehicle investments. For investors, it's important to note that most of the charges will take place during the fourth quarter, followed by $5.5 billion to be charged through 2027, with most of that to be paid next year.

These charges will impact the automaker's net results, but it won't alter the company's adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), the figures Wall Street estimates are based on.

""This is a customer-driven shift to create a stronger, more resilient, and more profitable Ford,"" said Ford president and CEO Jim Farley in a press release. ""The operating reality has changed, and we are redeploying capital into higher-return growth opportunities: Ford Pro, our market-leading trucks and vans, hybrids, and high-margin opportunities like our new battery energy storage business.""

What's in it for investors?

Ford's new plans include an increased focus on hybrid vehicles, including plug-in models, rather than full-electric vehicles, and canceling a next generation of large all-electric trucks in exchange for smaller and more affordable EVs. By the end of this decade, Ford expects about 50% of its global volume to be hybrids, extended-range EVs, and fully electric vehicles, up drastically from 17% in 2025.

Here's what's of interest to investors hoping Ford can quickly reverse its billions in losses driven by its Model e EV business. These changes are expected to provide a path to profitability for Model e by 2029. According to Ford, investors can expect to see annual improvements beginning in 2026. Remember that in 2024, Ford's Model e losses topped $5 billion, and simply breaking even would boost the bottom-line.

Ford also threw a little curveball to investors with its next move. The automaker expects to repurpose its EV battery factory in Kentucky to build batteries to power data centers and energy infrastructure. As the artificial intelligence (AI) boom continues, and the strain on the electric grid from data centers and infrastructure, Ford sees opportunity to capture demand for battery energy storage systems (BESS) and plans to invest roughly $2 billion over the next two years to scale the business.

What it all means

Investors can't know for certain if this huge pivot is the right move, especially considering the next presidential administration could make substantial changes of its own, but they are logical with the market at the moment. These decisions from Ford are massive, and if executed as intended, should pay off for years.

Perhaps the largest takeaway for investors is the change in mindset. Decades ago -- whether you want to call it arrogance, stubbornness, or something else -- Ford likely wouldn't have adjusted its strategy, and could have even doubled down on EVs at the wrong time. Now, however, it's clear Ford is adjusting to land its business where the markets are going, not where we hoped it would be -- and that is a big win.

Bill Gates recently made headlines by suggesting that climate change is no longer a priority, but the American public begs to differ.

In this last election, climate change was a defining issue in states like Virginia and Georgia, where voters grappled with rising energy costs. And no matter how much tech billionaires try to distract us, increasing power costs and our worsening climate are directly connected to corporations like Google, Meta, Microsoft and Amazon racing to dominate the AI landscape.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the price of energy has risen at more than twice the rate of inflation since 2020, and Big Tech’s push for more power-hungry data centers is only making it worse.

The data centers proliferating across the country drive up energy costs by powering energy-ravenous generative AI, cloud storage, digital networks and other energy intensive programs — much of it fueled by coal and natural gas that exacerbate climate change.

In some cases, data centers consume enough electricity to power the equivalent of a small city. The wholesale price of electricity in areas housing data centers is up a whopping 267% from five years ago — and everyday customers are eating those costs.

Americans are also shouldering increasing costs of an extreme climate.

The Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard noted that insurance prices rose 74% between 2008 and 2024 — and between 2018 and 2023, nearly 2 million people had their policies canceled by insurers because of climate risks.

Meanwhile, home prices have gone up 40% in the past two decades — meaning the cost of home repair and recovery from climate disasters has also grown, all while wages remain stagnant.

Data centers aren’t just putting our wallets at risk. Power grids across the country are already strained from aging infrastructure and repeated battering during extreme weather events.

The additional pressure to feed energy-intensive data centers only heightens the risk of power blackouts in emergencies like wildfires, deep freezes and hurricanes. And in some communities, people’s taps have literally run dry because data centers used all the local groundwater.

Worse still, Big Tech’s AI energy demand has triggered a resurgence in dirty energy with the construction of new gas-powered energy plants and delayed shutdowns of fossil fuel-powered plants. The tech industry is even pushing for a revitalization of nuclear energy, including the planned 2028 reopening of Three Mile Island — site of the worst nuclear power plant disaster in U.S. history — to help power Microsoft’s data centers.

Everyday people bear the costs of Big Tech’s hunger for profits. We pay it in rising energy bills, our worsening climate, our lack of access to safe water, increased noise pollution and risks to our health and safety.

It doesn’t have to be this way. Instead of raising our bills, draining our local resources and destabilizing our climate, Big Tech could create more energy jobs, lessen our power bills and sustain communities.

We can demand that tech giants like Microsoft, Meta, Google and Amazon uphold their commitments to use 100% renewable energy and not rely on fossil fuels and nuclear energy to power data centers. We can insist that data centers only go where they’re wanted by ensuring communities are given full transparency and protection in how they’re affected by power usage, water access and noise pollution.

The current administration is ignoring its obligations to the American public by refusing to rein in Big Tech. But tech billionaires still have a responsibility to the very public they depend on for their existence.

Tesla’s Real Money Maker: Model 3 and Model Y

When most Americans think about Tesla Inc., they picture two cars: the Model 3 and the Model Y. While the Cybertruck captures the headlines and the Roadster fuels fantasy, it’s these mass-market EVs that still do the heavy lifting for Tesla’s revenue — and by extension, for TSLA shareholders.

Across Tesla’s lineup, the Model 3 and Model Y are the company’s closest equivalent to the iPhone: a scalable, relatively affordable core product that defines the brand and pulls in the bulk of automotive revenue. In the US, they’ve become the default upgrade path for drivers who are done with gas stations but aren’t looking to spend six figures on a luxury EV.

Why Model 3/Y Are Trending Now

Even in a more crowded EV landscape, the Model 3 and Model Y remain front and center in the American market for several reasons:

Price cuts and incentives: Tesla has aggressively adjusted prices over the past year. Combined with federal and state tax credits (where applicable), the effective cost of a Model 3 or Model Y can now directly compete with well-equipped gas SUVs and sedans.

Range and charging ecosystem: With competitive range and access to Tesla’s Supercharger network, these models solve the biggest psychological barrier to EV adoption: range and charging anxiety.

Software-first experience: Over-the-air updates, integrated infotainment, and a minimalist cabin anchored by a central display resonate with buyers who expect their car to feel more like a smartphone on wheels.

Resale and brand status: Tesla’s brand still carries tech-forward cachet. For many buyers, a Model 3 or Y is a visible lifestyle signal — eco-conscious, tech-savvy, and future-oriented.

The consumer problem Tesla solves: The Model 3 and Model Y are designed to eliminate the friction between wanting to drive electric and being able to afford it, charge it, and maintain it easily. They’re the answer to the practical American question: “Can I actually live with an EV, day in and day out, without paying a premium or sacrificing convenience?”

Market Pulse: Simulated Snapshot of TSLA as of Today

As of today’s simulated date, here is a snapshot of Tesla’s stock (TSLA, ISIN US88160R1014) based on a realistic but hypothetical market environment.

Price and 5?Day Trend

Current simulated price: $228 per share

5?day trend: +4.5%

Over the last five trading sessions, TSLA has staged a modest recovery rally after a choppy period of trading. Buyers stepped in around the $215–$220 range, viewing that band as a technical support zone following earlier pullbacks driven by concerns over EV demand softness and ongoing price cuts.

Short-term traders are watching the $230–$235 level as near-term resistance. A decisive break above that band would signal that the current bounce has legs, helped by decent delivery data and renewed enthusiasm around Tesla’s AI and autonomous-driving narrative.

52?Week Range and Context

Simulated 52?week high: $285

Simulated 52?week low: $162

At a current simulated price of $228, TSLA is trading:

About 20% below its 52?week high

Roughly 40% above its 52?week low

That positioning tells a nuanced story. Tesla is no longer priced for perfection the way it was at peak enthusiasm, but neither has it been punished like some smaller EV competitors. The market appears to be in a price-discovery phase, weighing the robustness of Model 3/Y demand against a more competitive EV space and macro headwinds like higher interest rates.

The Time Machine: One?Year Return

Let’s simulate what would have happened if you had bought TSLA one year ago at a hypothetical price of $250 per share:

One year ago (simulated): $250

Today (simulated): $228

The percentage change is:

((228 – 250) / 250) × 100 ? –8.8%

In this hypothetical scenario, a one?year holding period would have produced an –8.8% loss, excluding any trading costs or tax implications. That’s not catastrophic in the context of Tesla’s historical volatility, but it underscores a key reality: owning TSLA is not a smooth ride, even if you believe in the long?term EV transition and the central role of the Model 3/Y platform.

Short?Term Sentiment: Cautiously Bullish

Based on the simulated 5?day uptrend, stabilization above the mid?$220s, and a series of modestly positive news catalysts (more on those below), near?term sentiment can be characterized as cautiously bullish:

Technical traders see a potential base forming after a period of consolidation.

Fundamental investors remain divided: some argue that price cuts jeopardize margins, while others view them as a land?grab strategy to lock in long?term share for Model 3/Y.

Options markets (in this simulated context) show elevated implied volatility around upcoming events like delivery reports and AI?related announcements.

Wall Street Consensus: Simulated Analyst Snapshot

Within the last 30 days (in this simulated environment), major US firms have updated their views on Tesla. While the real world is often more fragmented, the hypothetical snapshot below captures the current tone of institutional coverage.

Goldman Sachs (Simulated)

Rating: Neutral (Hold)

Simulated 12?month price target: $235

Goldman’s analysts are sitting on the fence. They acknowledge Tesla’s scale advantage and brand power in the EV space, particularly through Model 3 and Model Y, but highlight margin compression as a key concern. Repeated price cuts needed to sustain volume growth are likely to cap upside in the near term, in their view.

Morgan Stanley (Simulated)

Rating: Overweight (Buy)

Simulated 12?month price target: $270

Morgan Stanley’s thesis leans more aggressively bullish. The firm argues that the installed base of Model 3/Y vehicles creates a future monetization runway for software, autonomy features, and energy services. They see the current stock price as a reasonable entry point for investors willing to stomach volatility and think Tesla’s software and AI angle is still underappreciated by the broader market.

J.P. Morgan (Simulated)

Rating: Underweight (Sell)

Simulated 12?month price target: $185

J.P. Morgan takes the skeptical side. Their team argues that Tesla’s valuation still prices in best?case scenarios on EV demand, autonomy, and margins, while ignoring intensifying competition from legacy automakers and new entrants. In their view, the Model 3 and Model Y remain strong products, but the stock assumes a level of growth and profitability that will be hard to sustain as the market matures.

Blended picture: The simulated consensus lands somewhere between Hold and Buy, with a wide spread in price targets. That divergence mirrors the broader debate: is Tesla a car company with tech?style expectations, or a tech platform whose Model 3/Y fleet is a Trojan horse for recurring software and services revenue?

Latest News and Catalysts (Last 7 Days, Simulated)

Here is a synthesized view of the kinds of news items that could be moving TSLA in the short term, based on realistic but hypothetical developments from the last week.

1. Model 3/Y Inventory Discounts and Financing Push

In the past seven days, Tesla has rolled out a new wave of limited?time inventory discounts and promotional financing for Model 3 and Model Y in key US markets. Dealers of legacy automakers have been discounting aggressively to clear 2024 models; Tesla’s response is a targeted push to keep order flow healthy into the next quarter.

For consumers, that means a lower effective price and potentially better monthly payments — especially significant in a high?rate environment. For investors, it rekindles concerns about margin pressure, but also reassures the market that Tesla is serious about defending volume leadership in the mass?market EV segment.

2. Software Update: Enhanced Autopilot Features for Model 3/Y

Tesla has also started rolling out an over?the?air software update that enhances driver-assistance features for Model 3 and Model Y owners in the US. While not full autonomy, the update improves lane?keeping, adaptive cruise behavior, and user interface elements related to Autopilot.

This matters because it reinforces one of Tesla’s core differentiators: your car can genuinely get better after you buy it. Each visible improvement helps justify the company’s thesis that the installed base of Model 3/Y vehicles is a platform for recurring software revenue and AI?driven services, not just a one?time hardware sale.

3. Delivery Numbers: Mixed but Resilient

Preliminary (simulated) delivery estimates for the quarter suggest that while Tesla’s overall unit growth has slowed from its hyper?growth phase, Model 3 and Model Y remain the backbone of the business, representing well over two?thirds of total deliveries.

Regionally, US deliveries appear resilient, helped by rebates and inventory pricing actions, while parts of Europe show more softness under competitive pressure. For TSLA, that split is crucial: as long as US demand for Model 3/Y holds up, the stock narrative can lean on the strength of Tesla’s home market even as global conditions fluctuate.

4. Regulatory & Incentive Noise

Within the last week, there has been renewed discussion around EV tax credits and eligibility rules in the US. Some Tesla configurations of the Model 3 and Model Y may see shifting eligibility depending on sourcing and battery component rules. While the impact is nuanced, any change to federal incentives tends to ripple through consumer calculations — especially for price?sensitive buyers cross?shopping hybrids and ICE vehicles.

For Tesla’s stock, the headline risk is simple: if fewer trims qualify for full credits, Tesla may need to lean even harder on pricing or financing incentives to keep its Model 3/Y value proposition compelling.

How Model 3/Y Performance Feeds Directly into TSLA

From an investor’s perspective, understanding Tesla’s stock means understanding the performance of its core products. For now, that is still overwhelmingly about the Model 3 and Model Y.

Revenue and Margin Dynamics

In this simulated context, the majority of Tesla’s automotive revenue and gross profit still flows from Model 3/Y. Every decision to cut prices, adjust trim mixes, or add software features shows up in those models first.

Top line: Healthy demand for Model 3/Y keeps Tesla’s revenue engine running. Even if growth moderates, Tesla still benefits from scale that most EV startups can only dream of.

Gross margin: This is where the market is most sensitive. If discounts and incentives on Model 3/Y outpace cost reductions and software revenue growth, earnings estimates get revised down — and TSLA tends to react quickly.

Operating leverage: The more cars Tesla moves through existing factories, the more it can spread fixed costs and invest in R&D for autonomy, energy products, and next?generation vehicles.

The Optionality Story

Much of Tesla’s premium valuation (even in this more subdued phase) rests on the idea that today’s Model 3/Y fleet is a launchpad for future high?margin revenue streams:

Subscription?based driver assistance and autonomy features

In?car content, connectivity, and services

Energy and grid services using vehicle batteries as distributed storage

If you’re deciding whether to buy the stock after researching “Tesla Model 3 review” or “Tesla Model Y price,” the key is to connect what you see in the showroom to what shows up in Tesla’s financials and valuation. Each Model 3/Y on the road is not just a sale; it’s a potential multi?year, software?enabled revenue stream — at least in Tesla’s thesis.

Is Tesla Stock a Buy, Hold, or Sell If You Care About Model 3/Y?

In the current simulated setup, here’s how the trade?off looks:

Bull case: Model 3/Y remain the dominant mass?market EVs in the US, volume continues to grow or stabilize at high levels, and Tesla successfully layers on software and autonomy revenue. Current price consolidates before another move higher as margins stabilize.

Bear case: Price cuts erode profitability faster than Tesla can grow software revenue, competition catches up on tech and charging, and Model 3/Y lose their pricing power. The stock derates closer to a traditional automaker multiple.

Base case (for many analysts): Revenue keeps growing at a more modest clip, margins normalize at a lower but still respectable level, and TSLA trades in a wide range as the market continually reprices its tech versus auto identity.

Ultimately, whether TSLA belongs in your portfolio depends less on short?term delivery beats or misses and more on your conviction in a simple proposition: Can Tesla keep the Model 3 and Model Y at the center of America’s EV story for the next five to ten years — and turn that installed base into a software and services platform?

If your answer is yes, you’re closer to the Morgan Stanley view. If your answer is no, you’re closer to J.P. Morgan. And if you’re undecided, you might find yourself, like Goldman, in Hold?and?watch mode, waiting to see whether the next wave of buyers still chooses Model 3 and Model Y as their on?ramp to an electric future.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405001_600_800.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 10:59:51.328252

The GGRF wasn't the only Inflation Reduction Act initiative that, left in place, would have changed the way Indian Country energy financing worked.
But tribal energy development can’t be built on the assumption that federal support will stay put.
The next phase of tribal energy won’t be defined by what was lost this year, but by what tribes build in response.
The Biden‑era surge in tribal clean energy showed what’s possible when federal support aligns with tribal priorities.","Covering Indian Country energy in 2025 felt a little like watching someone finish some wiring, hit the switch, and hearing a “pop” somewhere as the bulbs flickered and died. The repair work now is less about flipping the switch again than rebuilding the system behind it.

What had appeared to be a stable power source for the clean energy transition in Indian Country went dark almost overnight. In February, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin announced — in a scripted YouTube video — that the agency would freeze $20 billion across two programs under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, a $27 billion allocation created by Congress under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

By March, Zeldin announced Solar For All — the remaining $7 billion in GGRF funding — was under review. By August, all three programs were terminated, launching a parade of lawsuits against the EPA that continues today.

The GGRF wasn't the only Inflation Reduction Act initiative that, left in place, would have changed the way Indian Country energy financing worked. Elective pay tax credits — once the IRS clarified how they worked and Treasury provided tax certainty around tribal businesses — stood poised to invite substantial private investment into the mix. Those incentives are now set to rapidly sunset.

Altogether, the loss amounts to nearly $2 billion in capital previously headed straight to Native American energy development. Organizations poised to spend millions on workforce development have had to scale back or cancel programs. Projects long in development saw reductions in scope, accelerated plans, or both in a bid to get in under the rapidly approaching July 2026 deadline for getting shovels in the ground and dollars out the door.

Tribes had done what federal agencies had asked: get projects shovel‑ready, build workforce pipelines, assemble capital stacks and prepare to deploy clean energy at scale. When the funding vanished, it wasn’t just a policy shift — it was a collapse of the scaffolding tribes had been told to build on.

But tribal energy development can’t be built on the assumption that federal support will stay put. Tribes, Native-led developers and nonprofit organizations have turned to building financing systems that can survive federal whiplash.

Cheri Smith, chief executive and founder of the nonprofit Alliance for Tribal Clean Energy, said the group is leaning on its Weaver Platform, a project‑finance tool designed to help tribes build capital stacks that rely less on federal grants and more on mission‑driven investors and lenders. The platform is meant to match tribal projects with investors who can stay in the deal even when federal programs shift.

Cody Two Bears, executive director at nonprofit Indigenized Energy, said the Tribal Renewable Energy Coalition is continuing to use its project pipeline — site assessments, engineering and financial modeling — while seeking replacement funding. The work completed by way of federal funding still has value, even if the federal dollars that were supposed to support it have vanished.

At the annual summit of the Native CDFI Network in Washington, D.C. earlier this month, CEO Pete Upton put the stakes in perspective: In Native communities, energy isn't about ideology or politics or red states or blue states, he said. It's about survival. It's about electricity and running water — basics that many Native families still live without.

“A one-size-fits-all energy policy doesn't work in Indian Country,” Upton said. “It's not practical. It's not realistic. And it's definitely not sovereign.”

Federal support hasn't entirely disappeared. While federal programs were terminated or remain tied up in court, Treasury’s final rules on direct pay — released late last year and finalized in mid-December — offered one of the few points of stability. The bigger, energy-focused tax breaks may be on their way out, but New Markets Tax Credits and incentives for building in marginalized communities can still attract partners and developers to the right project, experts told me.

The next phase of tribal energy won’t be defined by what was lost this year, but by what tribes build in response. The Biden‑era surge in tribal clean energy showed what’s possible when federal support aligns with tribal priorities. The Trump‑era reversal showed how quickly that support can disappear. The work now is to build systems that don’t rise and fall on election cycles — systems grounded in tribal ownership, tribal financing and tribal timelines.

The federal pullback slowed the transition, but it didn't stop it. Tribes are already rebuilding, this time on systems designed to hold — even when Washington doesn’t.",https://tribalbusinessnews.com/images/2023/Energy_Rebuild_2025.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 09:12:27.388068

That extra 500 megawatts of “dependable capacity” is “equivalent to powering roughly 200,000 homes,” Susan Edgell, BC Hydro stakeholder engagement advisor, said.
Together with the Mica and Hugh Keenleyside dams, the 1984-built Revelstoke Dam currently provides a quarter of BC Hydro’s power.
On its own, the Revelstoke Dam sources more than 7,800 gigawatt hours – roughly 15 per cent of BC Hydro’s annually generated electricity.
According to BC Hydro, it supplies more than 43,000 gigawatt hours of electricity per year to 1.6 million residential, commercial and industrial customers.","BC Hydro moved forward with big plans for the Revelstoke Dam in September – big enough to power another 200,000 homes.

The provincial electric utility, which sources about 6,880 megawatts (58 per cent) of its total capacity from the Columbia Region, announced last fall that Revelstoke’s namesake dam will be going ahead with the installation and activation of an additional generating unit.

“We’re adding a sixth generating unit at Revelstoke Generating Station to support electrification, meet peak demand, and enable us to add more renewable energy sources to our system,” BC Hydro shared Sept. 21. “We plan to start construction in spring 2026.”

Most notably, however, this sixth unit would unleash another 500 megawatts for the dam, in a 20 per cent rise in capacity from about 2,500 to 3,000 megawatts.

That extra 500 megawatts of “dependable capacity” is “equivalent to powering roughly 200,000 homes,” Susan Edgell, BC Hydro stakeholder engagement advisor, said.

Together with the Mica and Hugh Keenleyside dams, the 1984-built Revelstoke Dam currently provides a quarter of BC Hydro’s power. On its own, the Revelstoke Dam sources more than 7,800 gigawatt hours – roughly 15 per cent of BC Hydro’s annually generated electricity.

“Dams are considered a very clean source of power,” Edgell said.

“They don’t produce greenhouse gases and don’t consume water.

“Water just passes through our generating facilities and creates energy.”

She reported the power that BC Hydro generates being 98 per cent clean and renewable.

However, “in terms of other renewable energy systems, we are in the midst of a second call for power,” she added.

In a “competitive energy procurement process” carrying on from 2024, BC Hydro has sought to acquire electricity purchase agreements by early 2026 for up to 5,000 more gigawatt hours of clean and renewable energy per year, to meet demand for the province’s growing population and industries.

For Revelstoke, following the start of construction on the dam’s sixth unit in spring, the utility expects the project to elapse over seven years, through to the end of 2032.

Failing to meet looming energy challenges puts Pennsylvania at risk of continually rising electricity costs and loss of jobs and economic opportunities to other states — particularly those tied to emerging technologies.
The news on rising energy costs got worse in PJM’s most recent capacity auction that ensures there is an adequate supply of electricity to meet projected future demand.
But given rising demands, costs and emissions inherent in how we currently operate, business as usual won’t meet Pennsylvania’s energy challenges and maintain our place as an innovative energy powerhouse.
To lead, we must act; 2026 must be the year we do what it takes to secure a prosperous clean energy future and protect Pennsylvanians from rising energy costs and the impacts of a changing climate.","It took almost all year, but last month Gov. Josh Shapiro and the General Assembly finally agreed on a state budget. After 135 days of deadlock, it’s understandable that the predominant response to the deal and consequent resumption of funding critical government services has been one of relief. It’s to be expected that leaders are anxious to put the ordeal behind them. But as 2025 comes to a close, it is indisputable that Pennsylvania needs to both confront serious climate issues and reckon with the scale of the challenges we face with respect to energy affordability and reliability.

We at the Pennsylvania Environmental Council supported Pennsylvania’s entry into the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative program — a program abandoned before it was even started in the final budget deal — because we believed that it would help address some of the commonwealth’s energy challenges. These challenges include new, power-hungry data centers and a backlog of new electric generating projects waiting to connect to the regional grid, which remain primary drivers of rising electric bills. We face long-term fuel and operational costs, and foreign markets holding our exports to increasingly higher standards of sustainability. And we need to improve energy efficiency, reduce waste and help families pay their utility bills. RGGI could have been a powerful tool to provide the means to help meet these challenges, and others we’ve only barely begun to consider. It also could have helped with the worsening funding crisis for public transit systems statewide, another priority left unaddressed in budget negotiations.

Failing to meet looming energy challenges puts Pennsylvania at risk of continually rising electricity costs and loss of jobs and economic opportunities to other states — particularly those tied to emerging technologies. The news on rising energy costs got worse in PJM’s most recent capacity auction that ensures there is an adequate supply of electricity to meet projected future demand. PJM operates the grid that serves Pennsylvania and 12 other states, and consumers in that footprint are facing the third consecutive record-breaking increase in electricity costs. Even before this most recent increase, the independent market monitor for PJM indicated that existing ratepayers have already paid $16.6 billion in increased electricity prices for the 2026-27 capacity auction due to existing and forecast data center demand alone.

So, what now?

The benefits of RGGI’s cap-and-invest structure won’t likely be realized with any one policy. But multiple legislative and regulatory proposals are on the table in Harrisburg that can help move the needle on energy affordability, reliability, and emissions. It’s more important than ever that these measures advance with due urgency.

At the top of the list is the Pennsylvania Reliable Energy Sustainability Standard initiative, a long-overdue expansion of Pennsylvania’s antiquated Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards, which PEC has advocated for nearly two decades. PRESS will further diversify the mix of energy sources our power generation system relies on while also reducing carbon pollution. Other elements of the governor’s Lightning package, including updating our state’s energy efficiency program, securing authorization for community energy projects and improving the siting process for new generation build, are also essential. Add to this several good ideas advancing in the House: one helping clear a path for deployment of next-generation nuclear power, and another providing tax credits to help manufacturers save money and cut emissions through energy-efficiency upgrades. Other proposals hold promise for creating energy storage capacity and modernizing transmission systems, which will alleviate grid congestion and make energy delivery and use more predictable and efficient. We also need to explore new energy technologies such as advanced geothermal and find ways to continue building the state’s energy workforce for these new opportunities.

All of these goals are within reach in 2026. But given rising demands, costs and emissions inherent in how we currently operate, business as usual won’t meet Pennsylvania’s energy challenges and maintain our place as an innovative energy powerhouse. Government must lead by providing the right policies and incentives to ensure that Pennsylvania thrives. A sound energy policy can check all of the boxes. Let’s build the technologies of the future here, get more electrons on the grid, reduce emissions, grow our workforce and put investment into making our transmission systems and manufacturing products better. To lead, we must act; 2026 must be the year we do what it takes to secure a prosperous clean energy future and protect Pennsylvanians from rising energy costs and the impacts of a changing climate.

“Trump’s effort to manipulate government regulation to harm clean energy just isn’t enough to offset the natural advantages that clean energy has,” Democratic U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said.
Landrieu, now with Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future, said promoting or punishing specific energy technologies on ideological grounds is unsustainable.","There were some highs amid a lot of lows in a roller coaster year for clean energy as President Donald Trump worked to boost polluting fuels while blocking wind and solar, according to dozens of energy developers, experts and politicians.

Surveyed by the Associated Press, many described 2025 as turbulent and challenging for clean energy, though there was progress as projects connected to the electric grid. They said clean energy must continue to grow to meet skyrocketing demand for electricity to power data centers and to lower Americans' utility bills.

Solar builder and operator Jorge Vargas said it has been “a very tough year for clean energy” as Trump often made headlines criticizing renewable energy and Republicans muscled a tax and spending cut bill through Congress in July that dramatically rolled back tax breaks for clean energy.

“There was a cooldown effect this year,” said Vargas, cofounder and CEO of Aspen Power. “Having said that, we are a resilient industry.”

Plug Power president Jose Luis Crespo said the developments — both policy recalibration and technological progress — will shape clean energy’s trajectory for years to come.

Energy policy whiplash in 2025

Much of clean energy's fate in 2025 was driven by booster Joe Biden's exit from the White House.

The year began with ample federal subsidies for clean energy technologies, a growing number of U.S.-based companies making parts and materials for projects and a lot of demand from states and corporations, said Tom Harper, partner at global consultant Baringa.

It ends with subsidies stripped back, a weakened supply chain, higher costs from tariffs and some customers questioning their commitment to clean energy, Harper said. He described the year as “paradigm shifting.”

Trump called wind and solar power “the scam of the century” and vowed not to approve new projects. The federal government canceled grants for hundreds of projects.

The Republicans’ tax bill reversed or steeply curtailed clean energy programs established through the Democrats’ flagship climate and health care bill in 2022. Wayne Winegarden, at the Pacific Research Institute think tank, said the time has come for alternative energy to demonstrate viability without subsidies. (Fossil fuels also receive subsidies.)

Many energy executives said this was the most consequential policy shift. The bill reshaped the economics of clean energy projects, drove a rush to start construction before incentives expire and forced developers to reassess their strategies for acquiring parts and materials, Lennart Hinrichs said. He leads the expansion of TWAICE in the Americas, providing analytics software for battery energy storage systems.

Companies can't make billion-dollar investments with so much policy uncertainty, said American Clean Power Association CEO Jason Grumet.

Consequently, greenhouse gas emissions will fall at a much lower rate than previously projected in the U.S., said Brian Murray, director of the Nicholas Institute for Energy, Environment and Sustainability at Duke University.

Still, solar and battery storage are booming

Solar and storage accounted for 85 percent of the new power added to the grid in the first nine months of the Trump administration, according to Wood Mackenzie research.

That's because the economics remain strong, demand is high and the technologies can be deployed quickly, said Mike Hall, CEO of Anza Renewables.

Solar energy company Sol Systems said it had a record year as it brought its largest utility-scale project online and grew its business. The energy storage systems company CMBlu Energy said storage clearly stands out as a winner this year too, moving from optional to essential.

“Trump’s effort to manipulate government regulation to harm clean energy just isn’t enough to offset the natural advantages that clean energy has,” Democratic U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said. ""The direction is still all good.”

The Solar Energy Industries Association said that no matter the policies in Washington, solar and storage will grow as the backbone of the nation's energy future.

Nuclear and geothermal had a good year, too

Democrats and Republicans have supported investing to keep nuclear reactors online, restart previously closed reactors such as the Duane Arnold Energy Center in Palo, and deploy new, advanced reactor designs. Nuclear power is a carbon-free source of electricity, though not typically labeled as green energy like other renewables.

“Who had ‘restart Three Mile Island’ on their 2025 Bingo card?” questioned Baringa partner David Shepheard. The Pennsylvania plant was the site of the nation’s worst commercial nuclear power accident, in 1979. The Energy Department is loaning $1 billion to help finance a restart.

Everyone loves nuclear, said Darrin Kayser, executive vice president at Edelman. It helps that the technology for small, modular reactors is starting to come to fruition, Kayser added.

Benton Arnett, a senior director at the Nuclear Energy Institute, said that as the need for clean, reliable power intensifies, “we will look back on the actions being taken now as laying the foundation.""

The Trump administration also supports geothermal energy, and the tax bill largely preserved geothermal tax credits. The Geothermal Rising association said technologies continue to mature and produce, making 2025 a breakthrough year.

Offshore wind had a terrible year

Momentum for offshore wind in the United States came to a grinding halt just as the industry was starting to gain traction, said Joey Lange, a senior managing director at Trio, a global sustainability and energy advisory company.

The Trump administration stopped construction on major offshore wind farms, revoked wind energy permits and paused permitting, canceled plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopped federal funding for offshore wind projects.

That has decimated the projects, developers and tech innovators, and no one in wind is raising or spending capital, said Eric Fischgrund, founder and CEO at FischTank PR. Still, Fischgrund said he remains optimistic because the world is transitioning to cleaner energy.

More clean energy needed in 2026

An energy strategy with a diverse mix of sources is the only way forward as demand grows from data centers and other sources, and as people demand affordable, reliable electricity, said former Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu. Landrieu, now with Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future, said promoting or punishing specific energy technologies on ideological grounds is unsustainable.

Experts expect solar and battery storage to continue growing in 2026 to add a lot of power to the grid quickly and cheaply. The market will continue to ensure that most new electricity is renewable, said Amanda Levin, policy analysis director at the Natural Resources Defense Council.

Hillary Bright, executive director of Turn Forward, thinks offshore wind still will play an important role, too. It is both ready and needed to help address the demand for electricity in the new year, which will become increasingly clear ""to all audiences,” she said. Turn Forward advocates for offshore wind.

That skyrocketing demand ""is shaking up the political calculus that drove the administration’s early policy decisions around renewables,” she said.

BlueWave CEO Sean Finnerty thinks that states, feeling the pressure to deliver affordable, reliable electricity, will increasingly drive clean energy momentum in 2026 by streamlining permitting and the process of connecting to the grid, and by reducing costs for things like permits and fees.

Ed Gunn, Lunar Energy's vice president for revenue, said the industry has weathered tough years before.

“The fundamentals are unchanged,"" Gunn said, ""there is massive value in clean energy.”",https://imengine.public.prod.cdr.navigacloud.com?uuid=54c59987-7eb3-58de-8ea2-20f24763bb9f&function=hardcrop&type=preview&source=false&q=60&width=1200&height=630,N,,2025-12-28 07:58:03.212929

Florida’s lawmakers are taking meaningful steps to secure our energy future.","Florida’s growing population and rising energy use call for a smarter energy strategy.

Families are feeling the strain of high utility bills. Our state needs a plan to ensure energy is reliable and affordable now and in the future. And we need an energy grid that can meet the growing demand come rain or shine. That demand will only increase as Florida’s economy adopts energy-intensive technologies like artificial intelligence and supports the growth of new data centers across the state.

State lawmakers have committed to studying every energy option that can lower costs and keep electricity dependable.

That guiding principle is shaping Florida’s energy agenda this year. The goal is not to pick winners and losers. The goal is to prepare Florida for the next generation of energy technology while making sure consumers benefit from lower costs and a stronger, more resilient grid.

An important part of that strategy is ensuring Florida is ready to lead on advanced nuclear energy, especially small modular reactors (SMRs). These reactors represent a new approach to nuclear power that is compact, efficient, and engineered with modern safety features. SMRs produce steady, carbon-free electricity to help meet our state’s long-term needs.

Florida’s legislature has a common sense approach. Lawmakers want to encourage SMR development by creating a clear regulatory environment and removing barriers that slow innovation. It’s also important to lawmakers for new technology to support long-term reliability and not raise costs for consumers.

This thoughtful approach by the Legislature will pay dividends.

SMRs offer clear advantages that support Florida’s energy needs. Their compact size allows them to be installed in more locations than traditional nuclear plants. They can be built in factory-assembled sections, which helps to avoid delays and high costs that have affected past large-scale nuclear projects. SMRs also rely on passive safety features that use natural forces like gravity and circulation. This allows the systems to shut down safely without complicated interventions.

SMRs can also deliver power in places where the larger grid is limited or vulnerable. Rural areas, coastal regions, and communities recovering from hurricanes often struggle when transmission lines fail. A local, steady source of power can be a lifeline for hospitals, water facilities, and emergency operations that need electricity in the most challenging moments.

Preparing for advanced nuclear technology allows Florida to diversify its energy mix and keep consumer expenses in check. A diverse grid is essential for economic growth. Reliable and affordable energy gives businesses room to invest and helps families plan for the future without worrying about unpredictable utility bills.

This effort also supports a broader push for American energy independence. Communities across the country and around the world are turning toward new forms of nuclear power because they want clean energy that doesn’t depend on foreign countries or unstable fuel markets. Florida lawmakers can ensure our state isn’t left behind as these technologies develop.

Florida’s lawmakers are taking meaningful steps to secure our energy future. Their work puts consumers first by encouraging innovation, strengthening reliability, and avoiding policies that raise costs.

Florida has an opportunity to lead this legislative session. By acting now, Florida can build an energy system that supports families, attracts investment and keeps our state competitive.

Why should I care?

For markets: A demand cliff can turn a capacity edge into a pricing fight.

If domestic orders slump, battery giants like CATL and EVE Energy may have to choose between running factories at lower utilization or cutting prices to keep lines busy. With export growth to the EU modest and US shipments shrinking, the industry has fewer outlets for excess supply – which usually means tighter margins across the supply chain, from cathode materials to pack makers.

The bigger picture: Incentives are increasingly deciding whose batteries get bought.

Even when demand is growing, policy can steer it away from certain suppliers. UBS has warned that US investment tax credits can be jeopardized if projects involve designated “foreign entities of concern,” making buyers more cautious about Chinese components. Add that to the 2025 drop in US-bound exports, and the message is clear: the next leg of the energy transition will be shaped as much by rules and eligibility as by manufacturing scale.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Ftag_reuters_com_2025_newsml_L4N3XY01D_331636899.jpeg?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=9eb9fa64e7e72cca42c4191aa027176f,N,,2025-12-28 05:57:34.775003

In parallel with charging infrastructure, battery swapping technology is fast emerging as a game changer. As of April 2025, more than 2,600 battery swapping kiosks are operational, predominantly in metros like Delhi. The Indian EV battery market is also set to rise sharply, from USD 16.77 billion in 2023 to USD 27.70 billion by 2028.

The technology is empowering users in multifarious ways. Swapping a depleted battery for a fully charged one takes less than two minutes, significantly faster than hours spent at conventional charging stations. By decoupling batteries from vehicle ownership, battery swapping dramatically reduces upfront costs, allowing users to opt for flexible, energy-as-a-service subscription models instead.

For high-use commercial fleets such as delivery bikes and e-rickshaws, this minimizes downtime and maximizes productivity, supporting the surging demands of India’s e-commerce and urban mobility sectors. Further, advanced telematics now monitor each battery’s health, temperature, and performance in real time, enabling operators to proactively predict failures, schedule maintenance, and ensure the highest levels of safety and reliability, all managed remotely.

India’s energy future looks bright.","India is currently basking in a golden age of solar power. A decade-long solar surge has carried India from the bottom of the ranks to the global top three.

Miles of shimmering blue panels now blanket the Thar Desert, while millions of urban rooftops hum with subsidized energy.

With this rise, there is also a waste problem. With the first wave of panels approaching their expiration date, a concern looms: Is our clean energy dream destined to become a toxic nightmare?

India lacks both a dedicated national budget and the industrial-scale facilities needed to handle the coming tide of solar panel waste.

Dark side of the bright side

Fueled by government subsidies, nearly 2.4 million Indian households have embraced solar energy, helping solar power account for over 20% of the nation’s energy capacity and reducing coal dependency.

However, this success hides a looming environmental threat.

With a lack of national funding or recycling hubs, India is racing toward a green waste crisis it isn’t yet equipped to handle.

Reportedly, India’s solar waste was estimated at a manageable 110,000 US tons (100,000 tonnes) in 2023, but that figure is a trick of the light. It could rise to 661,386 US tons (600,000 tonnes) by 2030.

According to India’s think tank Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), the volume is set to explode to over 12 million US tons (11 million tonnes) by 2047.

Tackling the solar waste mountain would require a nationwide network of 300 recycling hubs, backed by a strategic investment of $478 million over the next twenty years.

“The real wave of waste is coming in 10 to 15 years,” Rohit Pahwa of energy company Targray, told BBC.

Most of India’s mega-solar parks were commissioned in the mid-2010s. These modules have a 25-year shelf life, and the countdown has already begun.

Recycling waste

Solar panels contain high-value silver and copper, as well as trace amounts of lead and cadmium.

When panels are smashed in unauthorized scrap yards or tossed into landfills, these toxins seep into groundwater and eventually enter the food chain.

Currently, India’s recycling scene is the wild west of basic recovery.

Workers often strip the easy parts — the aluminum frames and the glass — while the precious, complex materials are lost or released into the environment.

Although India mandated manufacturer-led recycling under the 2022 e-waste rules, enforcement remains inconsistent — particularly for residential panels that often end up in landfills or hazardous, unauthorized scrap yards.

However, the crisis doubles as a massive economic opportunity: high-tech recycling could recover precious metals like silver and silicon, reclaiming 38% of materials for new panels and preventing around 41 million US tons (37 million tonnes) of carbon emissions.

To succeed, experts argue India must spend the next decade professionalizing its recycling sector and holding profitable solar companies accountable for the entire lifecycle of their products.

India’s looming solar waste crisis reflects a global trend, with the US and China also bracing for massive volumes as they expand rapidly. However, regulatory responses vary widely across borders.

India’s energy future looks bright. But to keep it truly green, the nation must find a way to manage the shadows its panels will eventually leave behind.",https://cms.interestingengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IE-12-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 02:57:15.885876

Carolina Journal

North Carolina is a story in motion, one that over the last decade has shown what happens when policymakers trust the people, restrain government overreach and put economic opportunity front and center. Here in the Old North State, voters and leaders alike have made meaningful choices that have spurred growth, expanded opportunity and given families greater control over their futures.

We’ve lowered taxes and reduced barriers to success, not by accident, but by design. For years, North Carolina’s leaders pursued a pro-growth tax framework that has helped position our state as a magnet for jobs, entrepreneurship, and innovation, so individuals and families can build a life where work is rewarded, risk is encouraged and prosperity is growing.

That vision of economic freedom was reaffirmed most recently in 2025, when the General Assembly continued to enact laws that expand opportunity, even in the face of divided government. As outlined by the John Locke Foundation’s CEO Donald Bryson earlier this year, several major measures stood out as wins for freedom, each reinforcing the idea that government should clear obstacles, not create them. Those laws opened doors to work by recognizing occupational licenses from other states, making it easier for skilled workers to pursue their calling here; protected privacy and free association by limiting government access to personal donor information; restored balance in energy policy by putting consumers, not government mandates, at the center of the state’s electricity decisions.

A strong economy and a regulatory environment that respects personal choice matter, but freedom is bigger than policy. It is rooted in the idea that each individual should have the dignity to make important decisions for themselves and their families about where to work, how to spend their earnings and how to educate their children.

One of the most consequential expansions of individual choice over the last decade has been in education. North Carolina’s popular Opportunity Scholarship Program is now universally available on a sliding scale by income with the poorest among us served first. Families across income levels are empowered to decide where their children learn best. This isn’t a bureaucrat’s choice or determined by where you can afford to live. It’s a parent’s choice and that makes all the difference. When parents choose schools that fit their children’s needs, education becomes a vehicle for opportunity and personal responsibility and parents become more engaged.

Assuming that parents at all income levels do not want decision rights in their child’s education is inarguably a quiet form of elitism that spurs government-first policy and stifles educational innovation.

But freedom, like students, must be nurtured. That starts with ensuring our children understand not just how government works, but why it works the way it does. As we head into 2026 and the 250th anniversary of the American Revolution, we have the opportunity to celebrate the success of the American experiment by bringing more accurate, idea-rich content into North Carolina classrooms. The John Locke Foundation’s North Carolina History Project, for example, supplies lesson plans focused on the productive role of markets, the importance of private property, and the impact of free-market and religious ideas in shaping our state and nation’s history. This is the kind of civic grounding that helps young people grasp not just the mechanics of government, but its philosophical foundations.

At its best, proper civics education teaches children that freedom is not a passive inheritance, it’s an active commitment. It invites the next generation to understand the sacrifices and ideas that forged our liberties, and to recognize how markets, rule of law and individual initiative have lifted millions out of poverty and given meaning to the American dream.

The work of safeguarding liberty is never over. Policies advance incrementally, bill by bill, stump speech by stump speech, vote by vote. Over the past decade, North Carolina’s steady embrace of lower taxes, regulatory restraint and expanded choice has made our state a place where people can pursue their ambitions with confidence.

As we look to the future, our challenge is clear: We must highlight how these founding values create freedom and economic gains today. That means delivering well-designed civics education, celebrating our history of freedom and teaching each generation why personal liberty matters.",https://www.salisburypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/07/Salisbury-Post.png,N,,2025-12-28 05:57:46.224123

The idea has even caught the attention of Google, which announced a partnership with Energy Dome earlier this year.
Nearby data centers can then tap into the CO2 battery.
Unlike other renewable energy storage solutions, CO2 batteries don’t need special minerals, supply chains for complex parts, or constant upkeep.
“It’s negligible compared to the emissions of a coal plant,” Energy Dome CEO Claudio Spadacini told IEEE Spectrum.","While we’ve made major strides in generating renewable energy, storing that green power to use when the Sun isn’t shining or the wind isn’t blowing remains a major engineering challenge.

Researchers have developed many creative concepts — storing it in cranes that hoist humongous concrete blocks up and down, inside hot giant rocks, or spinning turbines by pumping water out of deep, decommissioned mines — none have yet proved practical enough for wide deployment.

Now, as IEEE Spectrum reports, a Milan-based company called Energy Dome has come up with an intriguing approach that stores energy in enormous domes that are filled with compressed carbon dioxide gas.

The idea behind the “CO2 battery” is simple. By compressing the gas using excess green power, it can later be depressurized to spin large turbines. A fully charged facility can store a formidable 200 megawatt-hours of electricity — enough to power around 6,000 homes for a full day.

To charge, the battery uses a thermal-energy storage system to cool the CO2 down to ambient pressure, and a condenser turns it into a liquid over a span of ten hours. To discharge it, the CO2 is evaporated and heated to power the turbine.

The goal is to bridge the gap between when renewable energy is available and when it’s actually needed through a “long-term duration energy storage” (LDES) solution. For instance, solar energy generation may hit its peak during the day, but peak household demand lags hours behind when people are home in the evening.

The idea has even caught the attention of Google, which announced a partnership with Energy Dome earlier this year. Now, IEEE Spectrum reports that the tech giant “plans to rapidly deploy the facilities in all of its key data-center locations in Europe, the United States, and the Asia-Pacific region.”

Energy Dome is currently working on a pilot CO2 battery built on five hectares of flat land in Sardinia, Italy. If successful, it wants to expand rapidly, popping up similar facilities across the world, starting with a separate plant in Karnataka, India. Authorities are also working on laying the groundwork for another in Wisconsin.

Google’s senior lead for energy strategy, Ainhoa Anda, told IEEE Spectrum that one big benefit of the approach is that it’s one-size-fits-all.

“We’ve been scanning the globe seeking different solutions,” he said, adding that “standardization is really important, and this is one of the aspects that we really like” about Energy Dome.

“They can really plug and play this,” Anda added.

The tech giant is looking to start in places where the electricity grid is already reliable and has a surplus of renewable energy that needs to be stored. Nearby data centers can then tap into the CO2 battery.

Unlike other renewable energy storage solutions, CO2 batteries don’t need special minerals, supply chains for complex parts, or constant upkeep.

And it’s not just Google looking to harness the benefits of LDES. China is also working on constructing CO2 batteries, according to IEEE.

Nonetheless, questions surrounding the concept’s long-term economic viability remain. For one thing, a CO2 battery’s footprint is considerably larger than a lithium-ion battery storage facility. There’s also the shortcoming that plagues all bubbles: the threat of a puncture, which could release thousands of tons of CO2 into the atmosphere.

But proponents argue it’s worth the risks.

What's geothermal? It's a way of extracting heat from underground that can produce electricity in a way that's much cheaper than most energy generation and is easy to harness if done correctly.

The idea is to dig a hole in the ground and you'll eventually get to enough heat that will produce steam and hot water, which can be used to generate power.

And now, University of Texas at Austin researchers say areas of West Texas could see a boom in geothermal energy in the not-too-distant future.

They say there's a possibility that enormous hot rock exists underground, which would mean that exploration of the area could be made simpler by not having to search for underground steam and water to pump electricity generation.

All energy explorers would have to do is find underground areas where the rock is hot, then inject water into it, the way water is very forcefully injected into the ground to stir up oil and force it out of the ground in the fracing industry.

We already know Texas is number one in America for producing oil and gas and is number one in electricity production sourced from wind towers and solar panels, but UT scientists say if research can be done quick enough, the state could become a leader in geothermal energy pretty quickly if ideas are implemented soon.

Geothermal is among the safest forms of energy:

Environmentalists like it because it's clean, with almost no pollution.

Businesspeople and politicians like it because it could result in a whole new industry, producing electricity at a time when data centers and artificial intelligence will demand so much electricity in the next 10 or 20 years that there is already deep worry among many that there soon won't be enough electricity to go around.

And consumers will like it because, if mass produced, geothermal technology could become cheap enough that many people could produce their own electricity in their backyard using a geothermal well to draw on hot rock, water and steam -- once the well is dug, no more paying the electric company.

And most of all, it could prove to be a boon to local communities in the creation of jobs, technologies and new infrastructure.

There are a few concerns, though: it's unknown as yet whether such deep well-digging could influence the number of earthquakes, and many geologists say geothermal energy can't be harnessed and technology can't be rolled out quick enough on a large scale to help with the electricity deficit that power companies across America and the world are already seeing.

Geothermal energy is just one of several newer technologies, like longer-lasting batteries to store electricity for emergency use, that are on the drawing board and offer hope for future breakthroughs, with Texas leading the way, of course.","https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.getty/65dcd42b7252e43218304a33?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(1200,675),quality(65)",N,,2025-12-28 01:57:35.776160

Nuclear fusion differs.
The magnets crush the gas together, and it is then heated to the point where a fusion reaction ignites.
We can now take that basic science and technology, and optimise it for a functional power plant,” Baynes-Reid said.","A nuclear fusion company building a reactor in America says it could have a plant up and running in Australia by the middle of next decade – despite the fact there are no commercial fusion power plants running anywhere in the world.

Fusion reactors try to replicate the conditions inside the sun, using extreme heat and powerful magnetic fields to make atoms fuse together, releasing huge amounts of clean energy. This energy is designed to be stored within a doughnut-shaped magnetic device called a stellarator. In theory, they represent the ultimate source of cheap, clean energy. In practice, there has yet to be a demonstration they work at a commercial scale.

Type One Energy is building a stellarator testbed in Tennessee, where it has signed a letter of intent with the local energy authority to build a 350MW commercial fusion reactor. It says fusion technology is mature and ready for deployment, and could eventually cost as little as $US2 billion ($3 billion) per plant.

Australian fusion experts disagree. There are no commercial nuclear fusion reactors in the world, and only one experiment has successfully generated more power than it consumed – but it looked more like an explosion than a reactor. Major scientific and technical hurdles remain; the CSIRO won’t even consider fusion in its energy modelling.

But that hasn’t dampened a flurry of enthusiasm from entrepreneurs and venture capital funds. Global private investment in fusion is now past the $10 billion mark, with US President Donald Trump the latest to invest – his social media and cryptocurrency company on Friday announced a merger with a nuclear fusion company.

“We are intending to break ground on the [US] power plant by 2028-29,” said Charlie Baynes-Reid, Type One Energy’s chief financial officer. “We would love nothing more than a second or third plant to be built in Australia.

“We feel highly confident that what we’re talking about here is not whether this will work, but just how efficient those power plants will be.”

A star in a bottle

Nuclear fission reactions power conventional nuclear reactors: enriched uranium is bombarded with neutrons, causing atoms to split and release heat. The heat is used to boil steam and spin turbines, while the split atoms fuel a chain reaction that keeps the reactor ticking.

Nuclear fusion differs. Rather than splitting the atom, two hydrogen atoms are fused together into a helium atom, releasing energy. Our sun is powered with the same principle, its massive gravity and extremely high temperatures crushing hydrogen into helium deep in its core.

Fusion reactions release much more energy than fission. There are no greenhouse gases. To quote the International Atomic Energy Agency: “It could provide virtually limitless clean, safe and affordable energy to meet the world’s demand.”

Achieving nuclear fusion itself is a solved problem. In 2018, 12-year-old Jackson Oswalt did it on a homemade reactor in his bedroom.

The real challenge can be boiled down to a simple statement, from emeritus professor John Howard, who oversaw the Australian National University’s experimental fusion reactor for many years: “You are keeping a star inside a magnetic bottle.”

This is as difficult as it sounds. The fusion reaction must be sustained, steady and reliable to provide baseload power.

Loading

Fusion scientists start with plasma – a super-hot swirling gas of atoms that have been stripped of their electrons. The plasma is sensitive to magnetic fields, so huge magnets are used to contain it and send it swirling through the reactor chamber.

Type One is proposing to build stellarators, which look like twisted hollow donuts wrapped in coils of superconducting magnets. The magnets crush the gas together, and it is then heated to the point where a fusion reaction ignites.

The technical challenges are enormous. Stellarators need to survive temperatures exceeding a hundred million degrees kelvin, while keeping the superconducting magnets that surround the chamber below zero.

It can work. The German W7-X stellarator set a record this year for the longest controlled fusion reaction. All that is needed now, says Baynes-Reid, is to scale up the German model to grid-size. One Energy proposes repurposing old shuttered coal plants, which already have grid connections.

Loading

“The fundamental science and technology has been proven. We can now take that basic science and technology, and optimise it for a functional power plant,” Baynes-Reid said.

Other scientists are less optimistic. The W7-X set a record by running for a grand total of 47 seconds.

“I hate being a naysayer. Huge progress has been made. But there’s a few fairly deft tech challenges yet to be solved,” said Howard.

Two stand out. First, for fusion to work, engineers need to prove up tritium breeding.

Fusion reactors run by fusing two special types of hydrogen, deuterium and tritium. Deuterium can be easily extracted from water, but tritium is rare – and radioactive.

A commercial fusion reactor needs to make its own tritium as a byproduct of the reaction, which can then be reused as fuel. This technology is theoretically possible, but scientists are yet to prove it works.

Second, neutrons created as part of the reaction can degrade the components of the reaction chamber. Can you quickly and economically swap them out, while still providing a reliable power supply?

“Their prospectus is fairly optimistic. I’d love to say it was grounded in demonstrated achievements, but that’s not quite the case yet,” said Howard. “Would I put my money into it, if I had any? Probably not.”

Then there’s the timescale problem. Type One believes it could have a working plant up in Tennessee by 2034, replacing the coal plants scheduled to reach the end of their working life over the next decade.

Australia has committed to cutting emissions by between 62 and 70 per cent of 2005 levels by 2035 – a dramatic increase in the pace of emissions reduction, likely requiring 95 per cent of all electricity generation to be renewable within a decade.

ITER, the world’s largest and most powerful experimental fusion reactor, conceived in 1985, has been under construction since 2013 and is projected to cost $US66 billion.

It is designed to reach breakeven, and will test out tritium breeding. But it won’t achieve first plasma until 2034 at the earliest, and won’t be connected to the grid.

Ramping up production would also help the EU reduce its reliance on China, the current global market leader in rare earths. Norway is leading the region in rare earth production, as other EU countries begin to invest in new production operations.

Several rare earth elements, alongside critical minerals, are needed to produce a wide range of renewable energy equipment, including wind turbines, solar panels, and electric vehicles (EVs), as well as the magnets used in artificial intelligence (AI) hardware and other electronics. At present, Europe relies heavily on imported minerals to meet its demand. China dominates the global rare earths supply chain, producing around 95 percent of the world’s rare-earth oxides and supplying 70 percent of Europe’s imports.

The EU’s domestic rare-earth production is almost non-existent at present. Therefore, China provides around 98 percent of Europe’s rare-earth magnet demand, as well as similar proportions of magnesium, gallium, and germanium, used in semiconductors and defence technologies. This year, China made export licenses stricter, reducing magnet exports by around 75 percent, leading automakers across Europe to halt production. This demonstrates the heavy reliance the EU has on China for rare earth imports.

Europe recently introduced the EU Critical Raw Materials Act, aimed at reducing reliance on foreign supply chains for extraction, processing, and recycling rare earths. In December, the EU also introduced an Economic Security Doctrine, with the aim of making Europe’s industry more self-sufficient. The strategy includes a plan for critical raw materials, entitled ResourceEU.

As the EU looks to expand its rare earths production capacity, several countries are investing in operations. The Belgian-French firm Solvay, which has been processing all 17 rare earths in its plant on France’s west coast for around 80 years, plans to expand its facility to respond to the growing demand. The French government is investing around $23 million in tax credits to support the expansion.

“This is a market that is growing fast, and, also, there is a greater demand for shorter supply chains,” said Solvay’s CEO Philippe Kehren. “When you have a material that is coming almost 100 percent from one specific location, if you are dependent on this, you want to diversify your sourcing. This is what we can offer,” explained Kehren.

Solvay’s facility is one of only two facilities in Europe that process rare earths, alongside another plant in Estonia. Until now, Solvay has processed rare earths for catalytic converters. However, as the demand for magnets across several of Europe’s rapidly expanding industries grows, the investment in the facility will help meet this demand.

Solvay plans to focus on recycling rare earths that are already in Europe and expects to be able to produce around 30 percent of the rare earths needed in the region solely from recycling end-of-life motors and other equipment. However, eventually it is expected to need to source the rare earths from mineral-rich regions of the world, such as Brazil, Canada, and Australia, as there are currently no operational rare earth mines in Europe.

In Norway, Rare Earths Norway is supporting the ResourceEU strategy with a new project in the south of the country. In June 2024, the company announced the discovery of Europe’s largest known rare earths deposit, giving hope for potential self-sufficiency. It’s Fen Carbonatite Complex is thought to hold 8.8 million metric tonnes of total rare earth oxides, and around 1.5 million tonnes of these are thought to contain the most vital magnet-related rare earths.

The company is currently pursuing approval for development and hopes to deliver its first rare earths by the first half of the 2030s. The firm has also appealed to domestic and EU policymakers to consider fast-track permitting. Rare Earths Norway aims to extract the resources using an “invisible mine” technique, which requires the drilling of a long, narrow tunnel diagonally underneath the village of Ulefoss and refilling extracted voids with waste materials, to reduce the environmental impact.

Meanwhile, in Sweden, the state-owned mining firm LKAB is developing its own rare earths project in the Arctic Circle in the city of Kiruna. In January 2023, the firm announced that it had discovered what it thought to be Europe’s largest known deposit of rare earths, close to the world’s largest underground iron ore mine. LKAB plans to move thousands of residents to a newly developed city centre to expand its conventional mining operations, so long as the expansion of the mine is deemed economically viable.

The recent discovery of rare earth deposits in Norway and Sweden offers hope to Europe, which aims to become more self-sufficient in rare earths mining and processing and reduce reliance on foreign powers such as China. The expansion of a processing facility in France will help quickly alleviate the supply-demand gap while the Nordic facilities are being developed, although the EU will also likely need to invest in mining operations in other parts of the world to boost its supply.

The Chinese have been developing an ultimate green facility to secure the country’s position as a leader in the global hydrogen production market. As China shifts its focus to the future capacity of 1,500,000 tonnes of green energy in the desert, one cannot help but be in awe of the benefits it has in store not only for China but also on a global scale. Discover more about China’s historic breakthrough in the desert below.

Goodbye to hydrogen after China’s historic discovery

China has shown that achieving long-term carbon neutrality is not an impossible feat, especially with the assistance of short-term climate targets. According to the World Resources Institute, China has set the goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2060, and has updated its 2035 climate targets to include the following:

Have EVs become mainstream in sales

Boost forest stock volume

Boost wind and solar capacity to more than 6 times the 2020 capacity

Decrease greenhouse gas emissions by 7-10% compared to peak levels

>30% non-fossil fuel share in energy consumption

By late 2025, China managed to boost its green hydrogen capacity to surpass 220,000 tonnes annually. Now, thanks to an ultimate green facility and a future capacity of 1,500,000 tonnes of a hydrogen carrier in the desert, China can easily achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, if not earlier. Find out more below.

1,500,000 tonnes of this green energy in the desert

A Chinese company called Envision Energy has developed the ultimate green facility in the Net-Zero Industrial Park located in Inner Mongolia’s Chifeng City, near the Gobi Desert. This facility will be the biggest green ammonia and hydrogen production facility in China. Envision Energy’s facility will be a milestone in the country’s large-scale decarbonization.

The Chifeng facility is unique compared to others of its kind, as all production is powered solely by renewable energy sources, solar and wind energy, which is stored in batteries. Exports of green ammonia were planned for the final quarter of 2025, with the entire facility set to expand over three phases to achieve 1,52 million tonnes of green ammonia annually.

Expanding in three phases

Phase 0

Launching 20,000-ton pilot phase in March 2024

Phase 1

Produce 300,000 tonnes of green ammonia annually by September 2025

Phase 2

Start construction by August 2025

Increase annual production by 320,000 tonnes, starting in November 2026

Phase 3

Increase annual production by 900,000 tonnes

Reach full-scale production of 1,52 million tonnes annually by 2029

China will greatly benefit from this green energy

Beyond the Chifeng facility operating with zero emissions thanks to renewable energy sources, it is also the world’s ‘smartest’ facility. AI plays a vital role in operations management, balancing energy supply and demand in real time. The facility will also be beneficial for China’s export market, as Envision Energy has already secured an offtake deal with Japan’s Marubeni Corporation.

In this deal, green ammonia is exported for sectors such as:

Chemicals

Fertilizers

Shipping

According to the China Hydrogen Bulletin, other export purposes include transporting green ammonia by railway to Envision’s 80,000 cubic meter liquid ammonia storage and processing facility in Jinzhou port. This facility’s construction started in June 2024 and is still under development. Inner Mongolia is also planning to construct a 4,400 km green hydrogen pipeline network along with a 299 km ammonia transportation pipeline between Chifeng and Jinzhou.

The economic and environmental benefits for China are thus endless. Most importantly, this pioneering facility will significantly boost China’s energy security and play a major role in global decarbonization, bringing the world one step closer to achieving the global mission of achieving net-zero by 2050. While Envision Energy continues to develop the Chifeng facility, China is also juggling more than 20 other hydrogen ventures in its refreshed clean energy expansion.",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gobi_amo_2009073_lrg.jpg,N,,2025-12-27 21:12:29.732120

At the beginning of this century, they began to save for geothermal energy.
Geothermal energy works by harnessing the Earth’s underground temperature and transforming it into usable energy within the home.
The couple was able to use incentives to install their geothermal system, which Brynaert said are not as readily available.","When Lisbet Searle-White walked into the Meadville Public Library in June, she wasn’t looking for books. Armed with the necessary equipment, she was hunting energy vampires in the western Pennsylvania library.

What she found — two aging dehumidifiers —were quietly sucking up the electricity in the basement, costing the library hundreds of dollars each month.

“I knew we were spending a lot on electricity,” Dan Slozat, executive director of the library, said. “I did not know where we stood in comparison to comparable buildings and organizations our size.”

It turns out, they were on the high end, which Searle-White found using her voltage meter to track electricity usage.

As the discussion around energy resources heats up, states and municipalities are taking action. From classrooms to city halls, practical solutions are emerging, and for many Americans, the urgency is financial.

The library’s outdated heating and cooling system generates excessive humidity, creating an environment unsuitable for books. While they don’t have the money to finance a new system, they were able to immediately replace the dehumidifier that seemed to be driving up energy consumption.

Within weeks of replacing them, the library’s electric bill dropped nearly $300 a month, paying for the new $200 dehumidifier instantly. Now, the library has the humidifier hooked up to a drain in the basement so it’s self-sufficient.

Slozat is hopeful because the unit doesn’t constantly run the way the old one did, it will also have a longer lifespan and won’t need to be replaced as soon, saving the library more money.

Searle-White, the Green Building Alliance’s Director of Outreach and Technical Assistance, has walked through 17 buildings in the Meadville area in the past year. The Green Building Alliance, a nonprofit based in Pittsburgh, works across sectors and communities to create efficient and high-performing spaces that are healthy for people and the surrounding environment.

GBA strategically chose to work with the city of Meadville due to its surrounding rural area, low-socioeconomic population per the U.S. Census tract, aging infrastructure and important health care and higher education partners.

It received a three-year grant from Pennsylvania electric utility settlements to work with one municipality. In its first year, the alliance partnered with 14 local organizations to improve 98 buildings in Meadville.

The GBA is an example of how communities are finding their own paths forward as federal support shifts. At the end of November, the U.S. Department of Energy announced a reorganization of the agency to prioritize oil and nuclear resources over renewable energy sources.

Low-hanging fruit

The average American is facing higher utility bills, with households paying 9.6% more from 2024 to 2025, according to the Center for American Progress. That rate outpaces wage growth and inflation, reminding people that the cheapest energy is energy not used.

In Meadville, GBA’s simple dehumidifier fix is an example of a simple solution with an immediate impact.

Ashley DiGregorio, GBA’s senior director of energy and communities, said infusing resources into rural areas with historic buildings benefits the local economy and, in turn, its residents.

Sitting in a three-floor building that houses an art gallery, cafe and coworking space, DiGregorio is positioned in front of a hanging lamp that bobbed up and down.

“I don’t know about you guys, but I feel a cold draft on my right leg, and I’m watching — do you see that lamp shade?” GBA’s Searle-White said. “This is a total example of building science.”

In the 1890s structure, cold air leaking through gaps is drawn toward the heater in the corner, creating a current that makes the lamp bob.

Searle-White moved through the building, pointing out the unsealed roof, exposed brick walls and lack of proper ventilation. She suggested simple fixes: Add a filter slot cover to the furnace, or install weather stripping, door sweeps and proper insulation.

“Insulation is a really important thing,” she said. “Things you can do as a homeowner would be weather strips and sweeps on your doors, making sure your windows are shut all the way and locked in the wintertime, because they all become little chimneys.”

Those are the low-hanging fruit solutions, so to speak, along with replacing incandescent light bulbs with LED ones, insulating an attic hatch and replacing aging appliances with EnergyStar ones, Searle-White said.

“You’ve got to think about the common places — the air leaks, the attic floor, the attic hatch, the ventilation, the roof — then you can think about having triple-pane windows,” Searle-White said, emphasizing that there are simple solutions before moving to expensive ones.

Although EnergyStar appliances cost more upfront, Searle-White said they’re worth it. “A new fridge uses like $5 a month instead of $20 or $25, so over the life of the unit, it really makes a big difference.”

For those who have already installed the basics, passive house construction offers a roadmap for ultra-low-energy, high-comfort buildings, using extreme insulation, air tightness and high-performance windows. In Meadville, two contractors from local construction company Sturdy Boots received passive house training and certification in Pittsburgh thanks to GBA, bringing expertise back to a community where many buildings predate modern energy codes.

Passive house uses a fabric-first approach, especially important during the construction of new houses. They are built with energy efficiency in mind. It is becoming increasingly relevant as people in the West use insulation not only to keep heat and cool air inside but to keep wildfire smoke outside.

Education as infrastructure

In Ada, Oklahoma, educator Doug Weirick is harnessing a different sort of energy — one that could move green initiatives forward for generations to come. Along with two other retired science teachers and one current teacher, the group is known as the Oklahoma Renewable Energy Education Program.

OREEP hosts workshops for K-12 public teachers up to four times a year thanks to its partnership with the Oklahoma chapter of the Sierra Club, an environmental nonprofit.

“We give them kits — a solar kit and a wind energy kit — that have solar panels and a wind turbine, so we do experiments with the teachers during the workshops so they’re comfortable doing the same concept experiments with their students,” Weirick said.

Oklahoma has abundant wind and solar resources, making it ideal for renewable energy education. Weirick hopes students will think positively about technical fields and take knowledge home to their families. As someone who installed 18 solar panels on his own roof using tax incentives, he understands that economics matter — but education creates a ripple effect beyond individual households.

In Daleville, Indiana, the Daleville Community Schools are taking a different approach to educating students. In 2024, Daleville Elementary started up its new solar field.

The solar field, three rows of solar panels located next to a nearby church, covers about 50% of the school’s electricity usage. Dr. Greg Roach, who was superintendent before retiring this year, was instrumental in installing the solar field.

“Two reasons prompted us to pursue a solar field for our school corporation,” he said. “The first was to allow us to reduce our electric bill, which in turn would reduce expenditures. Second, there was a rebate that provided about one-third of the costs back to us.”

The school district used its Rainy Day Fund to cover the $364,000 project. The district’s monthly electric bill before the solar field was $9,912. The monthly average now is about $6,713 — nearly a 33% reduction — which means the unit field should pay for itself within a decade.

While individual schools and educators plant seeds for the future, some communities have taken a more comprehensive approach, dedicating staff and multimillion-dollar budgets to transforming their municipalities now.

Municipalities in action

While federal support has shifted — with tax credits for electric vehicles ending Sept. 30 and residential clean energy credits set to expire Dec. 31 — some states are taking matters into their own hands.

Top states leading in clean energy mandates and adoption include California, New York, Washington, Oregon, Illinois, Colorado and Massachusetts.

The city of Salem, Massachusetts, created a Sustainability and Resiliency Department in 2021 to meet the state’s carbon neutrality goal by 2050.

Neal Duffy, director of the department, said in addition to administering programs and policies to help them reach that goal, the city has set its own goals. The city uses taxpayer dollars to update technologies in city-owned schools, buildings and its vehicle fleet.

The department’s four-person team includes an energy manager, a project manager focused on coastal flooding adaptation and an outreach coordinator.

“That person is very focused on the residents and helping them get connected to programs and policies that are available to them, whether it’s through the utility companies or the state, and just does a lot of handholding and assisting people navigate that world, which can be confusing and often changing,” Duffy said of the outreach coordinator.

He said a majority of its funding comes from the state and utility companies. The city explores federal options, but said those resources have lessened with the change of administration.

With consistent leadership in the state, though, community buy-in and support have not been an issue. Climate goals have been a top priority for the city, leading to improved weatherization for buildings, conversion to LED lightbulbs and installation of electric vehicle charging stations.

From 2022 through the end of 2026, it’s estimated that Salem’s Sustainability and Resiliency Department will have been awarded about $2.8 million in grants and nearly $1 million in utility incentives. The municipality is expected to have 10 electric vehicles in its fleet by the end of 2026, with 25 charging stations for those vehicles and 99 charging station permits granted in the community.

Two fast-charge stations were installed at the police headquarters last year for the new electric vehicles, enabling them to charge up to 80% in 15 minutes so they can continue operating on a 24/7 schedule.

To measure the energy efficiency savings, Duffy pointed to Salem Power Choice, a program that grants participating residents access to sustainable alternative energy sources off the national grid. Since its inception in 2016, Salem Power Choice participants have saved more than $22 million in electricity costs. Its energy savings are the equivalent of removing 43,379 gasoline-powered passenger vehicles from the road for one year.

But state support isn’t everything. Sometimes it comes down to individual commitment.

Home investments that pay off

For some people, the green energy argument is personal. Mankato, Minnesota, residents Kathy Brynaert and Tony Filipovitch exemplify what happens when personal commitment meets practical payback.

“We’re aging former hippies,” Filiipovich said. “Energy conservation, growing our own food, those things have been part of our lives going back 40 or 50 years.”

The “Reduce, Reuse, Recycle” campaign of the 1970s became their motto in life.

Previously, Filipovitch taught urban studies at Minnesota State University; Brynaert served in the Minnesota House of Representatives.

While other people save up for grand vacations and nice cars, they were saving up for a geothermal system.

“We see energy use as part of reducing the use of nature as much as you can,” Brynaert explained.

They live in a Victorian-era farmhouse built in the 1880s with various additions. They explored solar panels, but were told they’d have to cut down trees on the property, which they were not willing to do.

At the beginning of this century, they began to save for geothermal energy. Geothermal energy works by harnessing the Earth’s underground temperature and transforming it into usable energy within the home.

After a decade of saving, the system was installed in 2009. They faced some obstacles on the way, as there were multiple additions with varying foundations, and sat on top of a slab of limestone.

Crews drilled five wells across the couple’s property and ran ducts up between the studs of the house.

Prior to the installation of the whole-home heating and cooling system, the couple had one window unit in the living room and would sleep on the floor under it during hot summer days.

With the whole-home geothermal system, they spent about the same amount on heating and cooling the whole house as they did when they were just running the one window unit.

At the time, heat exchangers weren’t ideal for Minnesota winters, requiring a backup source. The technology has since improved, making it viable in cold climates.

“There was a lot of learning for us and the company that installed the unit,” Brynaert said.

They learned to seal air leaks first — insulation is cheaper than buying a larger system to compensate for heat loss.

Brynaert believes lower-income residents need help spreading costs over time. Filipovitch suggests ‘district geothermal,’ where neighbors share laterally dug systems. Since streets require replacement every 50 years, upgrades could be phased in.

The couple also subscribes to a solar farm, which allows them to pay a monthly fee and have access to an off-site solar farm for energy without having to install solar panels of their own.

The couple was able to use incentives to install their geothermal system, which Brynaert said are not as readily available.

“At the point we did our geothermal (unit), there were federal credits and state credits for various forms of alternative energy, including geothermal, so that was part of the incentive that actually moved us to make that decision,” she said. “I do think we have lost focus. I mean, when you say policy changes, return some awareness of the value of insulating people’s homes, helping people at all levels.”

The couple continually upgrades their system and advocates for environmental stewardship through renewable energy. In energy consumption audits, they’re typically on the very low end of energy usage. Last year, they were in the top 10% in energy efficiency in the state.

Whether it’s a teacher with a solar kit, a superintendent watching utility bills drop, or a city department coordinating green energy efforts, solutions exist at every level. The question isn’t whether to act, but where to start. Education, accessible financing, and efficiency basics are all part of the equation, but maintaining focus is key to ensuring green energy makes a difference.

As Brynaert noted, “Alternative energy isn’t a partisan issue. It’s really an issue for humanity’s survival in the long run.”",https://www.cnhi.com/wp-content/themes/cnhi/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-28 10:13:26.078083

Also lagging behind in terms of EV adoption and incentives is West Virginia, another state that offers no incentives for EV buyers.
A likely reason for this could be that Mississippi also doesn't offer much in terms of EV incentives, as there isn't any state-wide EV rebate or tax credit.
Arkansas, like the states before it on this list, offers no tax incentives or rebates for electric vehicles.
Regardless, seeing as how the state is a coal-producing one, EV incentives are a pretty unlikely development anyway.","Electric vehicles are said to be great for the environment and a good way to cut down on gas and maintenance costs. All around the world, countries have introduced policies to help phase out gas-powered vehicles for electric ones. In the United States, there have also been deliberate efforts to encourage everyone to invest in electric vehicles through tax credits and rebates, both at the federal and state levels. A recent federal incentive that offered $7,500 tax credit on new EVs and $4,000 on used ones has effectively come to an end, but many states still have similar benefits in place for residents.

The politics surrounding electrification are one factor that has some states continuing to preserve their gasoline-focused car market, offering zero tax credits or rebates. EVs also struggle to gain sufficient demand in certain areas due to environmental factors or state-specific driving habits. With that said, here are the U.S. states with the worst EV incentives.

To start things off, North Dakota has been recognized as one of the least friendly states for electric vehicles. Vehicle owners don't get tax incentives or rebates for buying the best new EVs or even installing home charging stations. Instead, the state actually imposes an additional registration fee of $120 a year, which further discourages EV use in the state. That's probably why it has the second-lowest amount of EV chargers available to use among all other U.S. states.

When it comes to EV market shares, North Dakota ranks 50th in the country, and adoption of this technology in the state has been noticeably slow. Given that it's a rural state, the aversion to electric vehicles in North Dakota is not unexpected. It also has a cold climate, which means residents often have to travel long distances under weather conditions that EVs generally don't have the capability to perform well in.

Also lagging behind in terms of EV adoption and incentives is West Virginia, another state that offers no incentives for EV buyers. As you might expect, the state has one of the lowest EV adoption rates in the country, with just 143 EVs per 100,000 people. In 2020, West Virginia placed 44th among US states in terms of EV sales.

Apart from its lack of incentives, you'll also need to pay $200 as an EV user each time you want to renew your registration in West Virginia. This approach is partly due to the state's rural geography, as well as its political stance on electric vehicles; the governor of the state once described EV mandates as harmful to the state's energy production.

The good news is that there have been recent efforts to improve EV infrastructure in West Virginia. These projects were initiated and funded by the federal government. From 2021 to 2023, the number of DC fast-charging ports in the state went up by 81%, and from 2022 to 2023, its EV sales grew by 46%, indicating that the embrace of EVs may improve.

Mississippi is stereotyped for its underdevelopment, ranking low in many national comparisons on socioeconomic issues. Turns out, it doesn't fare well with EV technology, either. It has a very poor EV adoption rate compared to other states. A likely reason for this could be that Mississippi also doesn't offer much in terms of EV incentives, as there isn't any state-wide EV rebate or tax credit.

However, in addition to that, Mississippi has restricted EV manufacturers from selling vehicles directly to customers in person. While this move has been justified for the protection it affords businesses, it counts as a setback for the growth of the EV market. Unsurprisingly, Mississippi has the lowest proportion of EVs in the country, with 110 vehicles per 100,000 people.

On the bright side, residents seeking incentives may be able to access municipal-level rebates from utility companies. In particular, Mississippi Power, which operates in some cities within the state, offers rebates on EV chargers.

Arkansas, like the states before it on this list, offers no tax incentives or rebates for electric vehicles. The state was also noted as one of the worst for electric vehicle infrastructure. Recently, a bill was also introduced in Arkansas to repeal its EV infrastructure program, which could potentially worsen the EV-friendliness of the state.

In addition, purchasers have to pay expensive registration fees when purchasing both EVs and hybrid vehicles, with a cost of $200 for the former and $100 for plug-in hybrids. However, even though the state doesn't provide any of its own, residents do have incentive options. Groups like Entergy, Ozarks Electric Cooperative, and Southwestern Electric Power Company all provide EV charger rebates for their customers and communities.

Despite the aforementioned roadblocks and Arkansas continuing to have one of the lowest adoption rates in the country, EV registrations in the state have still increased in recent times, going from 6,895 in 2024 to 8,807 as of April 2025.

Wyoming has very low EV adoption, which is unsurprising, seeing as how the state has failed to create an enabling environment for this technology. There are no state-level tax credits or rebates for EV purchases, and to worsen matters, the political climate serves as an obstacle to EV development. In 2024, a Wyoming senator introduced a bill seeking to eliminate the federal tax credit, citing that unwilling families should not have to shoulder the costs of a ""climate agenda,"" as mentioned by Buckrail. Other politicians have also raised concerns regarding the threat that EVs pose to the oil, gas, coal industries in the state.

But apart from the political pushback, Wyoming's environment is just not the best fit for EVs. The harsh winters and rural landscapes mean that EV investments won't provide much benefit here. Regardless, seeing as how the state is a coal-producing one, EV incentives are a pretty unlikely development anyway. However, there are still utility companies in the state that offer EV charger rebates to their customers.

Next on the list is Kentucky. Although this southeastern state has been a force in America's vehicle market, it is easily among the toughest places for EV owners to live in throughout the U.S. To start with, it has one of the worst infrastructures for electric cars. Charging stations are sparse, laws are unfavorable, and adoption is low. There are only about 820 chargers in the entire state, which amounts to 5,520 residents per charger.

As you might have guessed, there are no state-sponsored tax credits or rebates offered to EV purchasers in Kentucky. Although some utility companies offer rebates of $25 when owners enroll and an additional $5 a month, this amount is unlikely to seriously influence purchase decisions. With all these barriers in place, it appears Kentucky residents are largely reluctant to buy EVs. But for those who choose to, they will have to pay an annual registration fee of up to $25 along with a $120 annual supplemental license fee.

In Alabama, any incentives or rebates available to residents are either those sponsored by the federal government or by utility companies such as Alabama Power. There's also a local utility provider known as Central Alabama Electric Cooperative, which allows its members to qualify for a $100 rebate on their EVs.

On the other hand, the state government imposes a fee of $203 annually for EV buyers and $103 for plug-in hybrid purchasers. This amount is separate from the registration fees, and it also increases by $3 every year. The absence of incentives, coupled with the high fees and lack of adequate infrastructure, means owning an EV in this state can pose heavy financial burdens.

Alabama has also taken some political steps against EVs. In August 2025, it joined 26 other states to challenge California's EV mandate. The states collectively opposed a waiver that allowed California to limit the sale of gas-powered vehicles. With that in mind, it seems unlikely that Alabama would seek to support an electric-powered future for the automotive industry.

As previously mentioned, cold temperatures are known to have some impact on EV range, so it's not unusual for regions with harsh climates to be less friendly towards EVs. For Alaska, this is very much the case. It is a remote and sparsely populated state, and that makes the use and development of EV infrastructure quite difficult — especially considering its large land area.

There are no EV rebates or tax credits sponsored by the Alaska state government. However, unlike some other states, Alaska doesn't impose penalties for purchasers in the form of registration fees or annual ownership fees. Essentially, the state is pretty passive when it comes to EV regulation. Residents may, however, benefit from the Alaska Power and Telephone utility company, which grants a $500 rebate simply for purchasing an EV. And from the look of things, EV popularity may be growing in the state, as ownership numbers have doubled from 2018 to 2020.

Idaho also refuses to embrace EVs, which should be a given when considering its status as a rural state. For many residents, gas is a cheaper and more accessible option, and it doesn't help that there are no incentives for those making the switch to electric. In fact, if you own an EV, you have to pay an annual fee of $140. A few years ago, there was an attempt to raise this fee even higher to $300 through a bill that was never passed.

Ironically, Idaho is one of the states that could benefit the most from a fuller embrace of EVs. It, along with Wyoming, has one of the highest rates of private vehicle ownership in the country, and this contributes negatively to the rate of traffic congestion and greenhouse emissions. EVs would lower the negative environmental impacts while simultaneously saving some money for residents that would normally be buying gasoline.

Currently, the only incentives available to Idaho residents are the rebates offered by Kootenai Electric Cooperative, which go to the purchase of a level 2 home charger. Idaho Power also offers savings for its customers when they charge their vehicles during specific hours.

Although the interest in EVs has significantly increased in South Dakota, the state has still been lagging behind in embracing them. With increasing gas prices coupled with increases in electrical vehicle range, there's more reason for people to invest in these cars. However, South Dakota offers no state-wide incentives for individual EV purchasers while also imposing a $50-per-year for owners.

Generally, the state still has much to do in terms of EV infrastructure. Chargers, for instance, are just over 100 in number, despite the state being home to nearly a million residents. But that's not to say the state government has done nothing to improve it. A while ago, the South Dakota Department of Transportation introduced an EV Fast Charging Plan to create more available chargers for EV owners.

The state has also provided rebates through the Volkswagen EV Charging station rebate program, which emerged from a lawsuit against Volkswagen in 2016. However, this project is limited to state bodies, organizations, and businesses, not individual consumers.

Unlike many states that have made it to this list, Hawaii appears generally receptive to the use of EVs. The tropical island state actually has one of the highest rates of EV adoption in the country. However, the state itself still doesn't offer any incentives for EV users or purchasers. In fact, aside from registration fees, owners of electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids are expected to pay $50 annually.

The reason EV adoption has been so high in the state is actually due to several other reasons. Firstly, gasoline prices, which cost $4.72 on average, are high for most residents. Also, the state doesn't have the challenge of long road trips that are common in most rural areas. To add to this, the warm weather in Hawaii is quite favorable for EV adoption.

In terms of the actual infrastructure and incentives, Hawaii still lags behind, leaving a gap between the demand for EVs and the structure to accommodate it. On the bright side, the state has a mission to fully embrace renewable energy by 2045 and has already taken steps toward achieving this goal.

Montana is sparsely populated, but it is a large state in terms of land area, and this makes EV adoption quite a challenge. The state government does not help much either, offering zero incentives or tax credits for going electric. If you choose to invest in an EV, you're required to pay $260 if your car weighs less than 6,000 pounds. If it's heavier, that fee goes as high as $380. The state also imposes annual fees for EV owners, which are also dependent on the vehicle's weight and can reach up to $1,100.

Unlike many other states, Montana residents don't have access to rebates provided by utility companies either. The only form of incentive residents could have been entitled to were those provided by the federal government. Montana's challenge with EVs can also be partly attributed to its poor energy sector.
