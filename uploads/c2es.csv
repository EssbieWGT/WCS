""If Americans can be convinced of the real advantages of EVs, there's nowhere to go but up,"" EnergySage concluded.","With federal tax incentives for electric vehicles on the brink of their end date, a popular marketplace detailed myths about the clean automobiles. It noted that the United States is well behind other countries in adopting EVs.

In Norway, 90% of new vehicle sales are electric. That figure is 63% in Sweden and around 30% in the United Kingdom and China, EnergySage reported. The U.S. is at 9%.

""There's a stigma against EVs here that doesn't exist in other places, and a lot of it may stem from fossil fuel propaganda,"" the site stated. It added: ""It's time to debunk these myths once and for all.""

Big Oil, of course, has much to lose if EVs win. EnergySage noted lobbyists spent $7 million in 2021 just to work against a proposal to limit vehicle pollution from new cars, which was not set to begin until 2027.

EnergySage interviewed a trio of automobile industry experts, including Jonny Lieberman, who hosts Driving with Jonny (@drivingwithjonny). He cited people who have no interest in EVs and fear problems, such as fires, in saying, ""Every time one of those is brought up, it just strikes me as propaganda by Chevron, Shell, or the petroleum industry.""

Nikki Gordon-Bloomfield, who created Transport Evolved (@transportevolved), called it a ""perfect storm of political misinformation and fossil fuel lobbying — lobbyists in America are very, very powerful.""

To counter four myths, the independent clean energy platform laid out how EVs are not much more expensive than gas-powered cars. It noted that states, municipalities, utilities, and manufacturers also offer incentives similar to the federal tax credits — $7,500 for a new EV and $4,000 for a used one — that will expire Sept. 30. Home charging and the absence of regular maintenance needs help EV drivers break even after a few years, Gordon-Bloomfield said.

Range anxiety is also mostly a thing of the past, as today's EVs can travel 300-400 miles on one charge. The average American drives 29 miles in one day, according to the Department of Transportation. And ""even in the absolute worst conditions,"" Gordon-Bloomfield said, the charging time to reach 80% battery maxes out at 90 minutes.

EVs are far less prone to catch fire than their counterparts, with 25 blazes per 100,000 EVs sold. The rate is over 60 times higher for gas-powered vehicles, at 1,530 per 100,000. Batteries also last for 10-12 years, State of Charge (@StateOfChargeWithTomMoloughney) host Tom Moloughney told EnergySage, and they can be 80-90% efficient. Internal combustion engines are 20% efficient, with the remaining 80% of dirty energy use producing waste heat and noise, per Lieberman.

Finally, the EV industry is suffering from a crisis of confidence, per the experts. Despite their instant torque, high-tech features, and quiet cabins, electric vehicles are not as trendy as gas-powered vehicles in the eyes of consumers.

""In other countries, cars are sold very differently. In America, cars are very often seen as a status symbol, they're seen as an extension of the self,"" Gordon-Bloomfield said. ""We're buying more on image than we are on actual substance.""

In fact, EVs are converting drivers from India to France to the U.S. And almost all of them say they will never go back.

US workers can kiss another 1,000 factory jobs good-bye, now that the “salt battery” firm Natron has closed its doors. The closure is also a setback for renewable energy stakeholders, who were counting on a new generation of low-cost batteries for wind and solar storage. However, it’s not the end of the line for sodium batteries. Another US energy storage startup, Inlyte, is still on track to begin domestic production of it new sodium-iron battery formula.

Lights Out For The Natron Sodium Battery …

It seems like only yesterday that Natron was gearing up to produce its sodium batteries at a former lithium-ion battery facility in North Carolina. As of last year, Natron was prepping the site for an initial capacity of 600 megawatts, leading up to the gigascale buildout of additional factories in the future.

As of earlier this week, though, the hammer came down. Natron announced that it is winding down operations at its Michigan headquarters as well as the North Carolina shop.

The company did not provide a detailed explanation, but lurking in the background of every factory closure these days is US President Donald Trump and his misbegotten tariff wars, along with his persistent attacks on the domestic wind and solar industries.

Trump’s allies in Congress can also take a bow for destroying good-paying factory jobs all over the US. With Republicans in control of both the House and Senate, the President’s demand for a job-crushing tax bill — the “One Big Beautiful Bill” — sailed through Congress in July.

“The OBBB was enthusiastically supported by every Republican member of Congress from North Carolina, including so-called senators Thom Tillis and Ted Budd, and representatives Greg Murphy, Virginia Foxx, Addison McDowell, David Rouzer, Mark Harris, Richard Hudson, Pat Harrigan, Chuck Edwards, Brad Knott, and Tim Moore,” CleanTechnica’s Steve Hanley noted last week.

… Lights On For Sodium Energy Storage

So much for those 1,000 new jobs. Nevertheless, as President Trump surely knows, the renewable energy transition is unstoppable. Real estate investors and developers are continuing to fill the demand for onsite renewable energy, particularly solar energy, and they are fueling the demand for more, better, cheaper energy storage technologies, too.

Sodium emerged as a significant area of energy storage research about 50 years ago, but lithium-ion technology leaped ahead on the basis of superior energy density, durability, and other key parameters. Still, sodium offers the advantages of an abundant, non-toxic, non-flammable, and relatively inexpensive supply chain.

In addition, sodium offers the potential for long-duration energy storage at the grid-scale level, which the US Department of Energy (such as it is today) defines as at least 10 hours, ideally much longer. In contrast, the typical lithium-ion battery array only lasts around 4 hours or so.

Researchers have been chipping away at the limitations of sodium technology over the past 50 years, and that brings us to Inlyte today (see more sodium battery background here).

The Inlyte Solution

Inlyte surfaced on the CleanTechnica radar in March of this year when it announced plans for accelerating its manufacturing timeline in the US, in partnership with the Swiss sodium battery specialist HORIEN Salt Battery Solutions (formerly FZSoNick). Following the success of a pilot-scale plant in the UK, the new “Inlyte Factory 1” in the US will integrate Inlyte’s sodium-iron formula into HORIEN’s manufacturing system.

In June, Inlyte also managed to squeeze a $4 million grant out of the Energy Department, through the agency’s CiFER (Critical Facility Energy Resilience) program.

“Inlyte and its partners will develop and demonstrate an iron and sodium long duration energy storage system to improve energy resilience at the Alliance Redwoods site in Occidental, CA,” the Energy Department somewhat cryptically explained in a press statement.

Inlyte provided more details in a press statement of its own. Alliance Redwoods is a nonprofit organization and retreat destination for church groups and other nonprofits. It was selected for the sodium-iron battery demonstration partly due to its designation as an evacuation center and fire protection staging area in a high-risk area for wildfires, where both diesel fuel and lithium-ion energy storage technology are at a disadvantage.

“The project, developed with partner Vital Energy Solutions, will enhance wildfire resilience for a critical evacuation zone, reduce facility electricity costs, and provide a diesel-free alternative for long-duration backup power,” Inlyte explained. “Inlyte’s domestically manufactured, non-flammable battery solution is uniquely suited for this project, maintaining performance at high ambient temperatures.”

The plan is to integrate the 200-kilowatt, 4 megawatt-hour, sodium-iron energy storage system in a microgrid featuring a 570-kilowatt solar array. Despite the relatively small size of the overall system, Alliance is expecting a big payoff. Inlyte estimates that the organization could shave as much as $300,000 off its annual electricity bill once the microgrid is up and running in 2027.

In addition, the new system will provide a good two weeks worth of backup power in emergencies, enabling Redwoods to ditch the cost of maintaining a diesel backup generator. In case of an emergency, the extra added benefit of noise-free, pollution-free power generation will make life easier for first responders and evacuees at the site, too.

“The project will also provide backup power for Russian River Utility’s nearby water pump station, which is essential for public water supply and firefighting efforts,” Inlyte added.

Everybody Wants More & Better Energy Storage

A member of the Alliance board, Mike Dethlefsen, neatly summed up the case for on-site renewable energy and energy storage. “With Inlyte’s battery and our solar array, we can operate independently from the grid during outages at a greatly reduced cost,” he said. “Crucially, it ensures we can remain operational to serve our community and power other critical local infrastructure when the grid goes down.”

Those same factors can apply to any number of community assets and commercial properties. Inlyte already anticipates replicating the Alliance model elsewhere.

In the latest news from Inlyte, on September 5, the company announced that former Tesla manufacturing director Alison Armstrong is joining its executive team, along with Sandor Hollo (former CTO of GE Energy Storage) and Dilip Goswami, (former CEO of Molekule and venture partner at At One Ventures).

“The new leadership appointments mark a pivotal moment for Inlyte Energy as it transitions from technology development to commercial-scale production,” Inlyte explained.

As part of that transition, Inlyte has partnered with the leading utility Southern Company on a utility-scale version of its energy storage technology, to be demonstrated at a location in Birmingham, Alabama. Installation is expected before the end of the year.

Inlyte expects an evaluation period of at least one year to follow. “Results will be shared across a broad utility network, in collaboration with EPRI,” the company added, referring to the independent, influential nonprofit organization Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI).

EPRI launched in 1972, and it has been on a decarbonization tear of late. With a seal of approval from EPRI under its belt, Inlyte could be poised to make the most of an opportunity that slipped through the fingers of Natron.

Democrats spent the break tearing into the provisions of that law — it is projected to shift financial assets to the wealthiest 10% of households and take from the poorest 10% — while Republicans defended it, focusing on its tax incentives for individuals, which are temporary.

“This law is a direct attack on Medicare and Medicaid,” Rep. Frank Pallone (D-6th) said at the start of the recess, during a Piscataway event in late July focused on seniors.

The law cuts more than $1 trillion from Medicaid, the federal health option for the poor and people with disabilities, and if Congress does not act this year, health insurance costs under the Affordable Care Act will sharply increase.

Rep. Tom Kean Jr. (R-7th), who voted for the new budget law, said after a tour of local businesses in Philipsburg that it would help small businesses.

Gone from Washington for about a month, a window that has generated a swollen backlog of pressing national work, lawmakers filled their days with public meetings with constituents, bill introductions, town-hall meetings and foreign travel.

Pallone and Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-11th) met in Perth Amboy with the president of Planned Parenthood’s national organization about how cuts brought on by the new law will affect abortion access in states like New Jersey, where abortion is legal under state law. The law will reduce access for “tens of thousands” of patients in the state, Pallone predicted. “It blocks people from getting birth control, cancer screenings, and STI testing just because of where they go for care,” he said, alluding to how the law blocks Planned Parenthood patients from more than abortion services.

Campaigning, traveling

The Democratic nominee for governor, Sherrill spent the recess campaigning, criticizing her Republican rival Jack Ciattarelli and gathering endorsements.

While Sherrill was traveling in-state, Pallone and Sen. Andy Kim, New Jersey’s junior senator, went to Asia on congressionally organized trips.

Tasked with responsibilities to NATO, the transatlantic military alliance, Rep. Donald Norcross (D-1st) went to Britain, he said by email.

“As a member of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, I spent some time abroad, including in the United Kingdom, meeting with our allies to ensure our relationships with them remain strong,” Norcross said.

Beyond constituent meetings and town halls — Norcross said he’s hosted 111 during his time in Congress since 2014 — he also took it easier after his health scare this year from sepsis. “I also spent some time with my family, which was much-needed after my near-death experience earlier this year.”

Reps. Herb Conaway (D-3rd) and Nellie Pou (D-9th) were in Israel from Aug. 6 to 14 paid for by the American Israel Education Foundation, a group linked with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, an influential pro-Israel lobby.

“This trip allowed me to learn more about the horrific events of October 7th and the State of Israel’s and Gaza conflict that has been all over the news,” Pou wrote in a mandated disclosure about the trip for a congressional ethics committee. “Some of the meetings and events that I attended were seminars regarding Oct 7 hostages, meeting with families of these hostages, learning about humanitarian aid as well as being briefed on the events in Gaza, meeting with Israeli officials and many more briefings about the conflicts in the middle east [sic].”

Over the break, Pou was involved in 20 public events, spokesman Mark Greenbaum said, including parades in Paterson and Passaic, visits to senior centers and community centers and a visit to the pipe rupture in Paterson, where a series of water pipes broke this August.

Different views of Medicaid cuts

Conaway “did go to Israel where he heard directly from Israelis, Arab Israelis, Palestinians, and peace activists. He spoke about meaningful, long-term solutions that could one day bring this conflict to an end,” his spokesman Chris Garcia said by email.

Garcia said Conaway held a town hall in Hamilton, where the Israel trip came up. Like many other Democrats nationwide, Conaway, a medical doctor, held a “roundtable” meeting about Medicaid cuts and how they will affect New Jersey, Garcia said.

Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-5th) went to Israel on a separate trip, with Republicans and Democrats from the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.

Rep. Jeff Van Drew (R-2nd), who has insisted cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, the nation’s largest food-aid network, will not affect those in need, held one virtual town hall to which residents called in, said spokeswoman Paxton Antonucci, adding that Van Drew stayed in South Jersey during the congressional break.

“He was everywhere from county fairs to national and community nights out to church festivals, firehouse cookouts, and backyard barbecues,” Antonucci said in an emailed statement. “He also visited senior centers, toured small businesses, met with constituents, and fielded questions from local business, labor, and community leaders from every corner of our district — which is actually larger geographically than the entire state of Delaware.”

Spokespeople for Kean and Reps. Chris Smith (R-4th) and Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-12th) did not respond to requests for comment about their recess activities.

Escaping ‘craziness’ of Washington

“It’s always great to be in-district,” Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-10th) said in an interview with NJ Spotlight News. “Especially when we have so much craziness going on in Washington, D.C.”

“We had our back-to-school family resource fair, which was wonderful,” McIver said. Her office also hosted a public meeting on school lunch access, she said.

McIver’s office and the office of Rep. Rob Menendez (D-8th) also held joint meetings in Jersey City and Newark to discuss the impact of the budget law and “the work they are doing to stand up to the Trump administration’s escalating attacks on democracy,” said McIver spokeswoman Hanna Rumsey.

Republicans have the votes to pass a spending bill out of the House on their own. But they will need seven Democrats minimum in the Senate to clear that chamber.

With Congress out of town, President Donald Trump ordered National Guard troops into Washington, D.C., saying he was doing so to bring peace to the city, where crime is at a 30-year low, and warning he may send troops into other large U.S. cities. These troops are a common sight around the city, in particular at subway stations and transit hubs like Union Station.

Also in August, the White House fired the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. moved to restrict access to COVID-19 vaccines. The Environmental Protection Agency announced it wants to rescind a 2009 policy known as the “endangerment finding” that gives the agency the legal authority to regulate the gases that are warming Earth to a dangerous degree. Trump flirted with firing the head of the Federal Reserve, the U.S. central bank, a move economic experts say would unravel global financial markets. Trump welcomed Russian dictator Vladimir Putin to American soil, meeting him on the tarmac of an airport in Alaska. And Trump tried to cancel about $5 billion in foreign aid — money Congress had already greenlit — in what a federal judge ruled last week was illegal.

Epstein, new rules

With recess over, tension continues to percolate within Republican ranks in Congress about how to handle the Epstein files — an issue that has hounded the GOP for months.

Back on Capitol Hill, members have taken up the annual defense policy bill required to authorize the Pentagon, and Republicans in the Senate are drawing up plans to rewrite procedure for that chamber, allowing them to confirm nominees to federal positions in bunches, rather than one by one.

But their central task is to fund the federal government, which could run out of money to fund its day-to-day operations at the end of the month.

Neither the House nor the Senate is close to finishing their drafts of the annual spending bill to fund the government, and with Congress scheduled to be gone for its Rosh Hashanah break in late September, members will almost certainly pass a short-term bill to fund the government before attempting to pass something more substantial this fall or winter.

Republicans have the votes to pass a spending bill out of the House on their own. But they will need seven Democrats minimum in the Senate to clear that chamber.

“If Republicans want to keep the government open, they have to work with Democrats in a bipartisan way. That’s the only way to get it done,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, the Democrats’ leader, said. “Time is short.”

Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota criticized “Democrat obstruction” over Trump’s nominees, saying that was gumming up the funding talks.

“I hope,” Thune said, “that our Democrat colleagues will resist the calls from within for a shutdown and work with us to fund the government.”

As it often does, the Senate, where Thune sets the agenda, adjourned around 4 p.m. Thursday until Monday afternoon.",https://www.njspotlightnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/123/2025/09/National-Guard-National-Mall-US-Capitol.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 01:58:53.899385

Chris Wright, after hosting Trump at his Montana mansion, was tapped as Energy Secretary.","Oil billionaire Harold Hamm was spotted celebrating with Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago as the 2024 election results rolled in, according to reporting from The Wall Street Journal.

Harold is the founder of Continental Resources, and he pumped millions into Trump’s campaign, along with many other energy executives.

Their goal was simply to kill the momentum behind clean energy, make drilling easier, and lock in fossil fuels as the core of U.S. energy policy. Within months of Trump returning to the White House, that investment was already being repaid.

Trump’s administration quickly moved to open up federal land and offshore waters for drilling. He authorized new natural gas export terminals and gutted several regulations, including the Obama-era EPA rule that allowed the government to regulate emissions from vehicles, power plants, and oil-and-gas operations.

His “One Big Beautiful Bill” wiped out tax credits for EVs and added tax cuts for fossil fuel companies. The new law is expected to stall renewable energy projects and make it harder for clean energy to compete.

Executives drive policy from inside the room

Of course the top energy executives got seats at the table. Harold, Energy Transfer Executive Chairman Kelcy Warren, and then-Liberty Energy CEO Chris Wright helped raise millions for Trump’s campaign.

After the election, Warren gave $12.5 million more to MAGA Inc. His company also received a key permit extension for the Lake Charles LNG terminal, something the Biden administration had blocked.

Chris Wright, after hosting Trump at his Montana mansion, was tapped as Energy Secretary. Harold personally introduced Wright to Trump during a Mar-a-Lago roundtable. Wright wasn’t the only executive who got a new job.

At least a dozen former oil lobbyists and company heads are now scattered across federal agencies, including the Interior Department and Trump’s National Energy Dominance Council. The council’s mission is to speed up fossil fuel production, with the help of people who’ve spent decades in the industry.

The American Petroleum Institute, which couldn’t even schedule a meeting with the previous administration, is now back in daily contact. Mike Sommers, API’s chief, said, “We outlined a clear policy road map well before the last election, and they’ve advanced those issues at every turn.”

Trump met personally with API leaders in March. He told them oil and gas was his favorite industry. That same month, global tariffs were announced, but oil and gas products were excluded.

Exxon CEO Darren Woods, former Hess Corporation CEO John Hess, and Harold have all spoken directly to Trump by phone since the election. Many executives have Chris Wright’s number saved.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin have also met with energy executives multiple times since January.

Lower profits, more influence

The gains in access haven’t led to gains in profits. Oil is stuck around $62 a barrel, well below the $76 level it hit when Trump first entered office in 2017. That’s beneath the break-even point for many producers.

New tariffs on steel and aluminum, which Trump doubled in June, are raising drilling costs. Diamondback Energy says well construction costs are expected to jump by 25% this year. The company told investors that nearly every new well will be more expensive in 2025.

The financial pain is real. ConocoPhillips is cutting up to 25% of its workforce after its acquisition of Marathon Oil. Chevron is trimming 20% of its staff. Overall oil-and-gas extraction jobs dropped more than 3% from January through August, hitting a two-year low.

Still, many companies see this as a short-term cost for a long-term gain. Devon Energy, ConocoPhillips, EOG Resources, and Occidental Petroleum told investors they expect to save over $1.2 billion next year because of new tax breaks. BP, which also operates in the U.S., said those savings will offset the extra cost of tariffs.

At a Trump fundraiser in Midland, Texas, the president repeated his campaign line: “Drill, baby, drill.” Curtis Leonard, one of the executives in the crowd, recalled someone shouting back, “We decide if we drill, not the government.” Still, most companies are playing along.

Taylor Sell, CEO of Element Petroleum, summed it up: “We all voted for this.”

In April, Wright, Burgum, Zeldin, and Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins gathered in Oklahoma City to talk about how the industry can meet rising energy demand from artificial intelligence.

The meeting, arranged by Harold, had so many high-level officials that attendees apparently joked about how many showed up without being invited together.

The latest US Solar Market Insight Q3 2025 report from the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie warns that these policies could cut 44 GW of US solar growth by 2030 – an 18% decline.
Compared with pre-HR1 forecasts, that’s a total loss of 55 GW, or 21% fewer solar projects by 2030.
“There is considerable downside risk for the solar industry if the federal permitting environment creates more constraints for solar projects,” said Michelle Davis, head of solar research at Wood Mackenzie.
“The solar industry is already navigating dramatic policy changes as a result of HR1.","The US solar industry put nearly 18 gigawatts (GW) of new capacity on the grid in the first half of 2025. Even as the Trump administration rolled out anti-clean energy policies, solar and storage still made up 82% of all new power added to the grid in the first six months of the year. But the growth picture isn’t as sunny as it looks, according to the SEIA.

Trump’s big bill (HR1) and new administration actions targeting solar have dragged down deployment forecasts. The latest US Solar Market Insight Q3 2025 report from the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie warns that these policies could cut 44 GW of US solar growth by 2030 – an 18% decline. Compared with pre-HR1 forecasts, that’s a total loss of 55 GW, or 21% fewer solar projects by 2030.

“Solar and storage are the backbone of America’s energy future, delivering the majority of new power to the grid at the lowest cost to families and businesses,” said SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper. She added that the administration is “deliberately stifling investment, which is raising energy costs for families and businesses, and jeopardizing the reliability of our electric grid.” Still, Hopper stressed that demand will keep the industry growing because “the market is demanding what we’re delivering: reliable, affordable, American-made energy.”

Ironically, the report found that this year, 77% of new solar capacity has been built in states Trump won. Eight of the top 10 states for new installations — Texas, Indiana, Arizona, Florida, Ohio, Missouri, Kentucky, and Arkansas — all went red in 2024.

On the manufacturing side, the US added 13 GW of new solar module capacity in the first half of the year, with factories ramping up in Texas, Indiana, and Minnesota. That brings total domestic capacity to 55 GW. But momentum stalled in Q2, with no new upstream manufacturing investment as federal policy uncertainty spooked private capital.

Looking ahead, SEIA and Wood Mackenzie expect solar deployment to land 4% lower than pre-HR1 projections by 2030. Near-term solar growth is buoyed by projects already underway, developers racing against tax credit deadlines, and surging electricity demand as new gas generation becomes pricier and less reliable.

The report also highlights the risk of federal permitting changes. A Department of the Interior order throws up obstructions for solar permits, threatening about 44 GW of planned projects. Arizona, California, and Nevada are expected to be hit hardest.

“There is considerable downside risk for the solar industry if the federal permitting environment creates more constraints for solar projects,” said Michelle Davis, head of solar research at Wood Mackenzie. “The solar industry is already navigating dramatic policy changes as a result of HR1. Further uncertainty from federal policy actions is making the business environment incredibly challenging.”

SEIA has urged Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to reverse course, warning that the administration’s approach could mean lost jobs, higher power bills, and a weaker US economy.

The stakes stretch beyond energy: SEIA notes that if solar growth stalls as projected, the Trump administration will blow its chances at winning the global AI race – something it’s keen to do. Last week, the trade group rolled out a grid reliability policy agenda calling on leaders at all levels of government to shore up the grid with solar and storage to meet surging demand.

For those seeking alpha in 2025, the path lies in underappreciated industrial stocks and traditional automakers poised to thrive in a deregulated, energy-intensive future.","The 2025 Trump administration's sweeping rollback of emissions regulations and EV subsidies has ignited a seismic shift in capital allocation, favoring traditional automakers and energy-intensive industrial sectors. This policy pivot, framed as a rebuke to “overreaching climate mandates,” is not merely a regulatory reversal but a calculated realignment of U.S. economic priorities. By dismantling the EV subsidy framework and prioritizing domestic energy production, the administration is accelerating a capital flight from green-tech overvaluation to underappreciated industrial plays with robust balance sheets and domestic production capabilities.

Deregulation as a Catalyst for Detroit's Resurgence

The elimination of the “electric vehicle mandate” and the termination of state emissions waivers have created a regulatory vacuum that traditional automakers are swiftly filling. General Motors (GM) and Ford Motor (F) stand to benefit most from the suspension of CAFE compliance obligations, which previously forced legacy automakers to purchase costly emissions credits from EV startups like Tesla and Rivian. GM's CFO, Paul Jacobson, , .

The administration's 25% tariff on imported vehicles further insulates Detroit from foreign competition. , the universal application of the tariff allows it to raise prices without losing market share. This dynamic is particularly advantageous for Ford, which has pivoted to lower-cost ICE models and plans to scale back U.S. EV production in favor of European markets.

Industrial Sectors: The Hidden Winners of Deregulation

Beyond automakers, the energy and materials sectors are experiencing a renaissance. Fossil fuel giants like Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) are capitalizing on the reversal of offshore wind moratoriums and the reinstatement of energy infrastructure permits. Meanwhile, underappreciated industrial stocks are emerging as alpha generators:

CNH Industrial (CNH): , this agricultural and construction equipment leader benefits from the administration's focus on domestic infrastructure and energy projects. Its precision agriculture innovations align with the renewed emphasis on traditional energy sectors.

Paccar (PCAR): , Paccar's heavy-duty trucks are critical for energy and materials logistics. Its insourced engine production and premium pricing power position it to outperform peers in a deregulated environment.

Idex (IEX): A specialty machinery firm producing mission-critical equipment for energy infrastructure, Idex's lean manufacturing and R&D-driven growth make it a compelling play on long-term industrial demand.

The Risks of Green-Tech Overvaluation

While the administration's policies favor traditional sectors, they also expose the fragility of green-tech valuations. Tesla's stock, which surged on EV subsidies, now faces headwinds as tax credits expire and demand softens. Similarly, Rivian and Lucid's reliance on regulatory compliance letters from NHTSA has evaporated, leaving their business models vulnerable. The Department of Energy's recent report downplaying carbon pollution controls further undermines the economic rationale for aggressive climate mitigation strategies.

Strategic Investment Outlook

For investors, the 2025 policy landscape presents a clear dichotomy: capital is flowing toward industrial and energy stocks with strong balance sheets and domestic production capabilities, while green-tech overvaluation faces correction. Traditional automakers like GM and Ford, alongside underappreciated industrial plays such as CNH and Paccar, offer a hedge against regulatory uncertainty and geopolitical volatility.

In conclusion, Trump's emissions rollback is not a mere policy shift but a strategic reallocation of capital toward sectors that align with U.S. energy independence and industrial resilience.

Current wind power capacity in development is around 65,000 MW, down from around 74,000 MW a year ago.
All told, around 155,000 MW of renewable energy capacity is currently being built, down from around 186,000 MW a year ago.
Solar power capacity is quick to build, and the total solar capacity in operation rose from 120,460 MW in 2024 to around 121,311 MW currently, GEM data shows.
Operating U.S. wind capacity increased from 150,592 MW in 2024 to 151,429 MW as of mid-2025.","U.S. power developers are planning to sharply boost natural gas and hydropower generation capacity and are cutting back on plans to add new solar and wind farms, according to recent data on the U.S. power capacity pipeline.

As of mid-2025, U.S. power developers had just over 114,000 megawatts (MW) of natural gas capacity under construction or in so-called pre-construction, according to data from Global Energy Monitor (GEM).

That capacity total is more than twice as large as what was in developer pipelines a year ago. Gas plants are the single largest power source among all planned capacity additions at the construction and pre-construction stages, GEM data shows.

Developers have also sharply lifted planned hydropower and nuclear generation capacity from a year ago, and have made cuts to both solar and wind capacity plans compared to mid-2024.

The large changes within the planned power capacity mix highlight the impact of the sudden swing in federal government energy policies following the reelection of U.S. President Donald Trump.

The gas-heavy development schedule also underscores how utilities are prioritizing dispatchable power sources over intermittent renewable energy as they scramble to ensure that electricity supplies keep up with rapidly rising demand.

FIRED UP

Natural gas plants make up around 46% of currently operational U.S. power capacity, and 36% of capacity at the construction and pre-construction phases.

Around 16,300 MW of gas capacity is currently under construction, while around 98,000 MW is in pre-construction, which is where sites have been identified and relevant permits have been applied for.

On top of the roughly 114,000 MW of natural gas power capacity, U.S. utilities are building or planning to build around 36,000 MW of new hydropower capacity and nearly 8,000 MW of new nuclear capacity.

Those diverse power sources have an important common attribute – they are all able to be dispatched on command by utilities in order to balance system power needs.

The total volume of dispatchable power capacity currently in the developer pipeline is around 159,000 MW, and compares to around 57,000 MW at the same stage a year ago.

CLEAN CUTS

The sharply rising capacity footprint for dispatchable power contrasts with the capacity pipeline for renewable energy, which is also known as intermittent power because it is only produced when the sun is shining and the wind blows.

Total solar capacity currently under construction or in pre-construction is around 92,000 MW, down from around 112,000 MW at the same developmental stages in 2024.

Current wind power capacity in development is around 65,000 MW, down from around 74,000 MW a year ago.

All told, around 155,000 MW of renewable energy capacity is currently being built, down from around 186,000 MW a year ago.

Some of the apparent cuts to the renewables development pipeline can be explained by the fact that some of the capacity that was previously being built is now operational.

Solar power capacity is quick to build, and the total solar capacity in operation rose from 120,460 MW in 2024 to around 121,311 MW currently, GEM data shows.

Operating U.S. wind capacity increased from 150,592 MW in 2024 to 151,429 MW as of mid-2025.

Other reasons for the cuts to the renewable pipeline include the growing wait times for new power assets to get connected to local grids, and the rising costs for parts and materials – especially for wind farms.

Steep cuts to future tax breaks and subsidies under the Trump administration have also led to cuts to some renewable power capacity plans, especially in states with already long interconnection wait times.

RE-CHARGING

Utilities are also rapidly building out new battery storage capacity so that surplus power from renewable assets can be stored and then discharged during peak demand periods.

Around 8,000 MW of battery capacity is currently planned to be added to the U.S. utility network by the end of the year, according to data from energy data portal Cleanview.

When brought online, that new battery capacity would bring total U.S. utility-scale battery capacity to around 46,000 MW by the end of the year.

That expanded battery capacity will allow utilities to make better use of the renewable power capacity already in place, and ensure that solar generation that exceeds system demand needs during the sunniest periods can be stored for later use.

That in turn will ensure that the overall power mix within the U.S. generation system will continue to get cleaner over time, even if the pace of new solar and wind capacity growth continues to slow compared to previous years.

That said, the ramped-up gas development pipeline will ensure that natural gas remains the central pillar of the U.S. generation system once current construction and pre-construction of all power types is complete.

STAYING GAS-HEAVY

Gas capacity’s share of the overall U.S. power system will remain more than twice as large as any other power source, at 44%, once construction and pre-construction work is complete.

However, coal capacity will be overtaken by both wind and solar once the current construction binge is finished.

Coal has a roughly 15% share of total currently operating capacity, while wind has a 12% share and solar has a 10% share.

Expected changes to US power capacity by source after construction

Thomson ReutersExpected changes to US power capacity by source after construction

Once projects that are currently under construction and in pre-construction are complete, both wind and solar will have a roughly 14% share while coal power’s share will drop to around 12%.

That greater footprint from renewables will mean that clean power sources will boost their overall share of the capacity mix from 39% currently to 44% after building work is complete.

That in turn means that while the U.S. power system will remain primarily gas-fed, clean power sources will account for most of the rest and will play a key role in the ongoing pollution reduction efforts of the U.S. energy system.

About $44 million a year would be rebated to Whitehaven for its Winchester South coal mine under the fuel tax credit scheme, which is facing renewed scrutiny for its drag on public finances and decarbonisation goals.

The tax exemptions were introduced decades ago when the Commonwealth first introduced fuel taxes, based on the principle that off-road users should be spared from the costs of maintaining infrastructure.

Fuel tax is no longer ring-fenced for road repairs, however, and critics argue the scheme has become too costly – clocking in at roughly $11 billion a year – and keeping diesel users hooked on the emissions-intensive fuel.

In a first for Lock the Gate, the anti-coal and gas campaigner has seized on the fuel tax credits available to a specific coal mine as a line of critique.

Whitehaven’s proposed metallurgical and thermal coal mine in Queensland’s Bowen Basin is already facing legal challenge from other conservation groups worried about native species, water sources and the climate, including both burning the coal and the methane that tends to escape as it’s dug up.

Lock the Gate’s focus on fuel tax credits follows a push to reform the scheme ahead of the Labor government’s economic reform summit.

Notably, the Australian Council of Trade Unions called for a $20 million cap on diesel tax exemptions ahead of the productivity talks, hot on the heels of Climate Energy Finance’s suggestion of a $50 million ceiling on annual fuel tax credits per company.

The think tank’s model would allow businesses to claim rebates beyond the cap if they reinvested the funds into decarbonisation, such as electric trucks.

Director Tim Buckley said the “cap-and-reinvest” model had been well-received in Canberra and would only capture big miners, with farmers and small businesses well below the threshold.

Without reform, he said mining companies had little incentive to shift away from diesel – responsible for 17 per cent of Australia’s annual emissions – and embrace fast-advancing clean alternatives.

A Whitehaven spokesperson said large-scale electrification in mining remained “technically and commercially challenging” but the miner was monitoring developments in lower-emissions options.

Responding to the Lock the Gate analysis, the company spokesperson said the fuel tax excise was designed as a “user pay system” for maintaining public roads and the credit scheme complemented it by ensuring off-road mining, construction and agriculture companies did not bear the cost.

The mining sector’s contribution to the national economy “far outweighs any credit received under the system”, the spokesperson said.

The Lock the Gate analysis drew on Whitehaven-released data to estimate 85 million litres of diesel would be used by the Winchester South coal mine each year and more than 2.5 billion litres across its lifetime.

In 2025 dollars, this would result in the mine receiving about $44 million each year from the fuel tax credit scheme, or more than $1.3 billion throughout the mine’s operating life.

This total is more than the $1 billion needed to develop the mine, as pointed out by Lock the Gate Alliance national co-ordinator Ellen Roberts.

The Winchester South coal mine has secured state-level approval and is undergoing assessment through federal environmental laws.

Alister Veitch, head of business development at Acorn Bioenergy, described the site as a ""flagship hub"" for the company.
""Both energy security and food security are massively important to the UK, and partnering with Acorn Bioenergy helps us deliver both.""
Acorn Bioenergy is currently developing two additional plants in the UK, along with a dedicated gas injection hub.
The company was acquired in 2022 by Qualitas Energy, a global investor and developer in renewable energy, energy transition, and sustainable infrastructure.","Acorn Bioenergy launched its first anaerobic digestion (AD) plant in Winchester on Thursday, September 4. Located at Three Maids Hill, the plant converts agricultural residues and waste into biomethane, which supplies renewable gas to the national grid.

The facility, officially opened at a ribbon-cutting ceremony attended by the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, Winchester City Council leader Martin Tod, and partner farmers, is now fully operational.

Sarah Jones, Minister for Industry, said: ""Acorn’s development will deliver secure, clean energy for thousands of homes and provide jobs for the local community in Hampshire.

""Biomethane can play an important role in reducing our reliance on imported fossil fuels, boosting our energy security and helping us accelerate to net zero.""

The plant processes 83,600 tonnes of agricultural waste and break crops each year, generating more than 120 GWh of biomethane which is enough to meet the heating needs of more than 9,000 homes.

By converting farming by-products such as slurries, manures, and rotational crops into green energy, the facility is expected to save around 30,000 tonnes of CO₂ annually.

This equates to removing 15,000 cars from the road or planting 1.2 million trees.

Alister Veitch, head of business development at Acorn Bioenergy, described the site as a ""flagship hub"" for the company.

Mr Veitch said: ""We were delighted to launch the Three Maids facility, to demonstrate how renewable biogas generation can power homes, strengthen food security and support the UK’s net zero ambitions.

""Alongside our dozen sites in development, it is a major step towards our ambition to supply 25 per cent of the UK’s biomethane.""

Cllr Jackie Porter, who attended the launch event, said: ""The whole site is now operational which is really exciting. It's good to see it actually working and to see the support they are getting for it. We want to make sure it works really well with the community as well.

""My hope is that we can use this site with other sites as well, to really educate our whole community on the ways in which we can reduce our carbon footprint.""

The site, situated near a solar farm and InstaVolt’s EV superhub off the A34, forms part of Winchester’s growing renewable energy cluster.

It has created 15 direct jobs and is expected to support up to 50 roles across the wider engineering, rural, and infrastructure sectors.

The plant also produces nutrient-rich digestate, a bio-fertiliser used to improve soil health which reduces reliance on imported, carbon-intensive fertilisers.

In addition, the facility generates high-purity green CO₂ for sustainable industrial applications.

Nick Rowsell of West Stoke Farm, who supplies break crops to the plant, said: ""Having farmed at Three Maids Hill previously, we always found the land had limited agricultural value.

""However, it has strong potential with this new renewable biogas generation facility which we are now providing feedstock for.

""Both energy security and food security are massively important to the UK, and partnering with Acorn Bioenergy helps us deliver both.""

The project offers fixed-pricing agreements and lower fertiliser costs through digestate use.

It also gives farmers a reliable outlet for break crops grown as part of sustainable rotations.

By producing continuous renewable gas, the Winchester plant complements intermittent sources such as wind and solar, helping to stabilise the UK’s energy grid.

It also supports the Government’s aim to quadruple biomethane production by 2030–2035.

Acorn Bioenergy is currently developing two additional plants in the UK, along with a dedicated gas injection hub.

Amid this transformation, LG Energy Solution (LGES) stands out as a strategic contender, leveraging its production scale, R&D prowess, and strategic partnerships to position itself at the forefront of the battery revolution. For investors, the question is whether LGES can sustain its momentum amid fierce competition and technological uncertainty.

Market Position and Financial Resilience

LGES currently holds a 14.5% global market share in EV batteries, ranking third behind CATL and Panasonic [1]. Its U.S. expansion is particularly noteworthy: By 2025, the company is projected to become the largest EV battery supplier in the region, fueled by partnerships with Tesla, General Motors, and Hyundai [1]. This growth is underpinned by a KRW 6.3 trillion revenue in Q1 2025 and an 8.8% operating profit margin in Q2 2025, driven by cost-cutting measures and U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credits [3][5].

The company’s pivot to energy storage systems (ESS) further diversifies its revenue streams. By 2026, LGES aims to double its ESS production capacity in Michigan to 30GWh, capitalizing on the growing demand for grid-scale storage [5]. This strategic flexibility—shifting production lines from EV cells to ESS—demonstrates LGES’s ability to adapt to market dynamics, a critical trait in an industry prone to rapid shifts.

Next-Gen Battery Innovation: The R&D Edge

LGES’s long-term growth hinges on its ability to lead in next-generation battery technologies. The company is investing heavily in solid-state, lithium-sulfur (Li-S), and bipolar battery development. A key milestone: LGES plans to mass-produce Li-S batteries by 2027, a technology that promises 500 Wh/kg energy density—a leap beyond current lithium-ion standards [2]. By integrating bipolar designs, LGES aims to reduce component counts and enhance energy density, positioning itself as a leader in compact, high-performance batteries [2].

Comparatively, LGES’s R&D spend of $1 billion annually lags behind CATL’s $3 billion in 2023 [1][3]. However, LGES’s focus on lean electrolyte systems and cylindrical battery technology—such as its recent $1 billion deal with Chinese automaker Chery—highlights its agility in commercializing niche innovations [2]. Meanwhile, CATL’s dominance in condensed batteries (500 Wh/kg) and Panasonic’s delays in U.S. production underscore the competitive landscape’s volatility [1][2].

Production Capacity and Strategic Partnerships

LGES’s ambition to expand production to 540 GWh by 2025 is a bold bet on sustained EV demand [1]. This capacity, supported by partnerships with GM, Hyundai, and Volkswagen, positions LGES to meet North American automakers’ nearshoring needs. In contrast, CATL’s 390 GWh capacity and 37% market share in 2023 reflect its entrenched position in China and Europe [1]. Yet, LGES’s U.S. IRA tax credits and Michigan ESS expansion provide a unique tailwind, insulating it from China-centric supply chain risks.

Risks and Competitive Challenges

Despite its strengths, LGES faces headwinds. The EV battery market is highly cyclical, with prices falling due to overcapacity and raw material volatility [4]. Additionally, CATL’s technological edge in battery recycling (99.6% metal recovery) and Panasonic’s 4680 cell expertise pose long-term threats [3]. Geopolitical tensions, such as China’s export controls on critical minerals, could also disrupt LGES’s supply chain [3].

Investment Thesis

LGES’s combination of financial resilience, strategic diversification, and next-gen R&D makes it a compelling long-term play. While CATL’s scale and Panasonic’s legacy in consumer electronics are formidable, LGES’s U.S. IRA alignment, ESS pivot, and Li-S roadmap offer asymmetric upside. For investors, the key is to monitor the company’s ability to commercialize its 10-minute charge batteries and maintain margins amid price wars.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-08 02:59:46.355358

Bill to create long term jobs and business opportunities for Western Australians

Bold new legislation will be introduced by the Cook Government this week to unlock strategic precincts, fast-track approvals for major strategic projects around the State and maintain Western Australia as the strongest economy in the nation.

The State Development Bill 2025 will establish a modern and agile framework and is a major part of the Cook Government's strategy to make WA a global leader in investment attraction, industry facilitation and regulation.

The Bill is a key response to discussions at the Trade and Economic Resilience roundtable convened by the Premier in May this year. It builds upon the government's recent commitment to establish a WA Productivity Commission, as well as the nation-leading planning and environmental approvals reforms delivered during the last term of government.

The Bill aims to future-proof WA's regulatory system, ensuring our high standards of protection are maintained while streamlining complex and time-sensitive processes. It will allow the Premier to declare State Development Areas and Priority Projects, supported by the Coordinator General who will be delegated statutory powers to coordinate across agencies and facilitate regulatory processes.

The Coordinator General will be provided with tools, including information notices, timeframe notices, due regard notices, joint decision notices and modification orders, all designed to ensure major strategic opportunities are delivered in an investment-friendly timeframe.

This new framework will enable a more strategic approach to State Development by increasing the certainty of end-to-end project approval timeframes, ensuring WA remains globally competitive and investment ready.

The new laws are designed to help WA secure major new economic diversification opportunities in support of the government Made in WA agenda, including:

Getting out of coal fired power generation faster than any other Australian state, and setting the WA economy up for success in a world that is decarbonising;

Supporting WA's major trading partners to decarbonise, with critical minerals and clean downstream products, like green iron; and

Becoming the largest naval shipbuilding and maintenance hub in the southern hemisphere.

The Coordinator General's new role and powers will only be applied to the most significant precincts and opportunities. All other major private sector projects will continue to be driven by the Department of Energy and Economic Diversification, with the lead agency process retained. The government is also working on an additional round of general approvals reforms, which will be progressed in 2026.

Importantly, the legislation respects the independence of the Environmental Protection Authority and respects existing Aboriginal heritage protections, facilitating coordination across government while preserving the integrity of existing safeguards.

Over the past decade, Chinese companies have played a fundamental role in the expansion of Argentina’s clean energy infrastructure, both through financing and direct participation in large projects.

However, recent geopolitical and economic changes, such as the current Argentine government’s closer alignment with the United States over China, the significant cuts made to Argentina’s public infrastructure budget since 2024, and global trade tensions, cast doubt on China’s interest in maintaining that financing momentum.

This comes amid concerns about the future of renewable energy in Argentina, where the relevant regulatory framework, covering the period of 2015 to 2025, is reaching its conclusion. Law 27,191 established incentives to target 16% of electricity demand being met with renewable sources by the end of 2021, rising to 18% by the end of 2023 and 20% by the end of this year.

According to official data, the share of renewables in Argentina’s electricity mix reached 13% in 2021, rose to 14.3% in 2023, and averaged 17.2% in the first four months of 2025. Of the renewable energy generated so far this year, 70% has come from wind power, followed by solar power with 19%.

“Chinese investment in renewable energy in Argentina has shown sustained growth and diversification both in terms of technology and geography,” said Oriana Cherini, a researcher in international relations at the National Council for Scientific and Technical Research (Conicet).

“Companies such as PowerChina and Envision have developed wind and solar projects in several provinces, within a framework of cooperation initially promoted at the national level, and coordinated through instruments such as Argentina’s accession to the Belt and Road Initiative,” she added.

Among the most significant Chinese solar projects is the Cauchari solar park, in Argentina’s northern province of Jujuy. It has 312 megawatts of installed capacity, which is expected to be expanded to 500 MW. The plant was mainly financed by the Export-Import Bank of China (Exim) and built by PowerChina, Shanghai Electric Construction and Talesun. Another notable project is the Cafayate solar park in the north-western Calchaquí Valley, built by PowerChina and inaugurated in 2019, with a capacity of 97.6 MW.

China also has a significant presence in the wind sector, backing four wind farms with a total installed capacity of 355 MW in Loma Blanca, in the southern province of Chubut. These projects were built by PowerChina and are operated by the Chinese firm Goldwind, as is the Miramar wind farm in the south of Buenos Aires province, with 96 MW of capacity.

Factors at play

According to Stella Maris Juste, a Conicet researcher with a PhD in international relations, one of the main impediments to the development of new projects is the availability of funds from large Chinese institutions such as its policy banks, the Exim Bank and the China Development Bank – “the ones that normally finance investments in renewables” in Argentina, she said.

A recent report by the Global Development Policy Center at Boston University in the United States detailed that China allocated USD 472 billion in public financing and public guarantees to low- and middle-income countries around the world between 2008 and 2024. According to the report, however, current lending levels are well below the highs recorded in 2015-2017; total lending from the two institutions to Latin America and the Caribbean averaged just USD 1.3 billion per year between 2019 and 2023.

On the other hand, the report says foreign direct investment (FDI) from Chinese companies is on the rise: “Chinese FDI has skyrocketed, both in absolute terms and in relation to development financing. This change could reflect a maturing of the Belt and Road Initiative, as Chinese companies gain experience abroad and are able to take on project management themselves.” The trend is apparent in other locations where China invests, such as Indonesia.

For Juste, government programmes launched to stimulate renewables in Argentina, such as RenovAR in 2016, which now no longer exist, facilitated the mobilisation of resources at an earlier stage. Added to this is the geopolitical factor of strained relations: “When political ties are strong, there is more synergy in financial cooperation,” she said.

Juste and Cherini agreed on the growing importance of Argentina’s subnational governments for Chinese investment, given President Javier Milei’s closer alignment with the United States.

Until 2023, the national government played a facilitating role in relations with China, favouring strategic agreements. This is no longer the case – now it is the provinces taking the initiative. “Through subnational agendas, many of them are promoting direct links, becoming key players in energy cooperation,” said Cherini.

Future prospects

One of the factors impacting the renewable sector’s outlook is the expiry of the 2015 renewable energy law at the end of this year.

Gustavo Castagnino, who directs corporate, regulatory and sustainability affairs at the renewable energy firm Genneia, said an extension of the law is being pushed for. This would maintain the 20% target, for a deadline yet to be confirmed, along with the legal and fiscal protections for those investing in the sector.

“Energy demand will remain steady in the coming years, and renewable energy is very competitive today, so we expect penetration to grow strongly anyway,” Castagnino added.

Camila Mercure, who coordinates climate policy at the Environment and Natural Resources Foundation (FARN), an NGO, argues that although this year’s targets are unlikely to be met, the law was an important tool for the sector’s development. “Not updating the law creates barriers and challenges for the transition in our country,” she says. “Above all, it creates great uncertainty about what energy policy will look like in terms of renewables in the coming years.”

Another key factor when analysing the future of Argentina’s renewables sector is the lack of infrastructure development for electricity transmission, needed to support sources such as wind and solar. Significant Chinese investment has arrived in transmission projects in neighbouring Brazil and Chile, while in 2022, China’s State Grid announced plans to invest USD 1 billion in grid upgrades around Buenos Aires. But these grid shortcomings in Argentina have limited growth opportunities in recent years. In May, the government presented a plan for the private sector to finance 16 priority transmission projects.

“The electricity system needs new investment in generation, transmission and distribution to ensure more competitive energy – i.e. lower costs and a more secure system,” said Castagnino.

As such, Mercure said that the country’s limited electricity transmission infrastructure is making distributed generation – for example, solar panels fitted to a house or powering a micro-grid – an appealing option. Argentina currently has just 78MW of installed distributed electricity capacity, and approximately 2,900 electricity-generating users. Almost all of these users rely on solar panels, practically all of which in Argentina are imported from China – though the country’s first domestic factory is set to enter production this year.

The region contributes approximately 23 per cent of Australia’s industrial emissions, due to its heavy concentration of hard-to-abate mining, resources and industrial sectors.

The new report, written by Marsden Jacob Associates (MJA) and titled Common user transmission and decarbonising Pilbara energy demand, advocates for a Common User Transmission Infrastructure (CUTI) system, enabling “multiple users and generators to connect to a single, shared grid, replacing the traditional model where each miner builds and operates private, siloed infrastructure.”

According to a summary of findings from the CEFC, the report finds a $30 billion savings opportunity versus “a fragmented, go-it-alone approach”, which is made up of “$4 billion in avoided transmission costs and $26 billion in avoided generation and storage costs over 25 years.”

It also claims a 21 per cent reduction in land required for transmission, 29 per cent reduction in new transmission line length under the CUTI approach, and 16 per cent reduction in required renewable energy and storage capacity assets.

Ian Learmonth, the CEO of the CEFC, said on Monday that, “This report confirms that smarter, shared infrastructure delivers both climate and economic wins. It is the kind of solution that strengthens Australia’s position as a future energy superpower.

“We are proud to support this work, building on the WA Government’s leadership in advancing shared transmission planning in the Pilbara. It shows what can be achieved when policy leadership, commercial opportunity and clean energy innovation come together with a shared goal.”

But its true impact extends well beyond incentives: OBBBA is unsettling the entire financial and insurance underpinning of the U.S. clean energy industry.

OBBBA has accelerated deadlines, with projects now required to begin construction by July 4, 2026, or be in service by December 31, 2027, to qualify for credits. It has also removed the 5% cost-based safe harbor starting September 1, 2025, meaning that only physical work counts toward eligibility. That change alone has lenders and insurers spooked, uncertain when or if returns will materialize.

Meanwhile, Trump’s tariffs on essential materials like steel, copper, and solar components have pushed construction costs even higher. “We’re really now seeing the impacts of what the new reality in the U.S. has meant for investor confidence,” says Meredith Annex, Head of Clean Power at BloombergNEF, after reporting that wind and solar investments plunged 36% year-on-year to $36.4 billion in H1 2025, with onshore wind collapsing 80 percent, the Financial Times reported.

At the same time, insurance is becoming a major issue. Underwriters are recalibrating risk models that now include political unpredictability. As Canaan Crouch of Jencap Specialty Insurance Services warns, “Higher insurance premiums add another cost burden to contractors and developers already grappling with reduced subsidies, higher tariffs and volatile demand.” That’s effectively redefining how projects are valued and bankrolled.

Insurers are tightening their terms in ways that directly reshape project economics. Premiums for utility-scale solar and offshore wind have climbed sharply over the past year, with underwriters increasingly carving out exclusions for mechanical failure and weather-related damage, according to Reuters. Industry brokers say some carriers have shortened policy durations from three years to one, forcing developers to renegotiate coverage annually at higher cost. In offshore wind, several European reinsurers have already reduced their U.S. exposure, leaving a smaller pool of carriers willing to underwrite billion-dollar projects and driving up rates for those that remain.

The disruption is being felt by the industry’s biggest players. Denmark’s Ørsted, once a clean-energy trailblazer, has approved a $9.4 billion emergency rights issue after its U.S. offshore wind projects, Sunrise Wind and Revolution Wind, hit policy roadblocks. Construction on Revolution Wind, almost 80% complete, was halted by a federal stop-work order citing national security concerns, prompting Ørsted to sue the Trump administration. Meanwhile, the company is burning millions weekly in holding costs, and S&P Global has already downgraded its credit rating though Equinor, a 10% shareholder, has pledged up to $941 million in support.

Nor is this limited to utility-scale clean energy.

In residential solar, firms like Sunnova and Mosaic have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy amid uncertainty over tax credits and a decline in demand. Canary Media reported that Sunnova laid off over half its workforce (over 700 employees) before filing, citing untenable debt and market retrenchment. Mosaic, a major residential solar loan provider, also went bankrupt, pointing to macroeconomic headwinds and policy unpredictability.

These are not small casualties. Analysts predict a 50-60% reduction in residential solar demand, risking over 250,000 jobs. As Ara Agopian, CEO of Solar Insure, put it, “There’s going to be a 50 to 60 percent downturn in demand. Many of them will shut their doors as they can’t stay in business without the tax credit.” The Financial Times noted that Guggenheim’s Joe Osha underscored the long-standing difficulties.

In Sunnova’s case, a July 31, 2025 court approval allowed the sale of substantially all assets to a creditor group highlighting how even bankruptcy is being managed to mitigate fallout for homeowners.

States are also feeling the heat, with Texas, once a renewable stronghold, seeing developers cancel or delay nearly $8 billion in projects, while BloombergNEF has tallied over $22 billion in clean energy development shelved nationally, costing more than 16,000 jobs.

Beyond wind and solar, OBBBA’s implications also extend to battery and hydrogen sectors. The law phases out credits for battery manufacturing and accelerates deadlines for hydrogen projects under Section 45V. Experts at the International Council on Clean Transportation estimate U.S. battery production could fall 75 percent short of expectations by 2030, cutting into the clean energy value chain.

Banks that once offered competitive terms on project loans are now widening spreads to reflect heightened policy risk, while credit rating agencies have flagged uncertainty over future cash flows as a trigger for downgrades. Institutional investors that fueled the tax-equity boom of the past decade are becoming more selective, in some cases pausing commitments entirely until the regulatory landscape stabilizes. The result is a much smaller pipeline of available capital and steeper financing costs for developers.

What’s emerging is a clarity that OBBBA’s biggest impact may be the erosion of the industry’s financial ecosystem. Insurance premiums are climbing. Lenders are retreating or demanding new risk-adjusted returns. Developers are cannibalizing capital just to stay afloat.

Guest Opinion. One of the things that is never mentioned is something that both President Joe Biden and President Donald Trump agree on and that is increasing the nuclear power capacity in the U.S. Biden had a goal of tripling nuclear energy; Trump has a goal of quadrupling nuclear energy. Biden planned for 200GW by 2050; Trump’s goal is 400GW by 2050. In a recent survey, 61% of Americans favor nuclear energy.

The reasons may include reduced carbon emissions and compliance with our commitments on international climate change agreements, but the elephant in the room is the electricity appetite of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The electricity needs for data centers that run artificial intelligence applications cannot be met with existing energy resources. According to the MIT Technology Review: “In the US, estimates from industry and academia suggest energy demand for data centers could be as high as 400 terawatt-hours by 2030—up from fewer than 100 terawatt-hours in 2020 and higher than the total electricity demand from the entire country of Mexico.

One of the ways both presidents planned/plan to meet their goals is by building new nuclear reactor capacity, but also by recommissioning nuclear power plants that may have been decommissioned.

Remembering the 1970s and the context for the creation of these nuclear power plants: The commercial nuclear energy industry started in the U.S. with the first nuclear reactor going online in 1969 (Nine Mile Island), followed by others in 1971(Palisades) and 1974 (Three Mile Island). The first nuclear power plant to start operating in December 1969, the same month that one of the most sweeping environmental statutes in the world was passed, the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. In July 1970, President Richard Nixon created the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) through his reorganization plan. Yet nuclear power was not embraced as a clean alternative but as far too dangerous to humans and the environment.

Then in 1979, Three Mile Island had its infamous nuclear plant accident. Through a series of human errors, Unit 2 suffered a meltdown that produced radiation and caused the need to evacuate people within a five mile radius of the plant. Fortunately, there were no injuries and no deaths as a result of the accident. However, Unit 2 was permanently closed, and Unit 1 continued to produce energy until 2019.

The Palisades has been closed since 2022 and going into decommission status; while Three Mile Island stopped its last nuclear reactor Unit 1 in 2019.

Nuclear Energy Status

The United States now has 94 operating commercial nuclear reactors at 54 nuclear power plants in 28 states. The average age of these nuclear reactors is about 42 years old.

The oldest operating reactor, Nine Mile Point Unit 1 in New York, began commercial operation in December 1969. The newest reactor to enter commercial service is Unit 3 at the Alvin W. Vogtle Electric Generating Plant in Georgia, which began commercial operation on July 31, 2023, and is the first reactor to come online since Watts Bar 2 was commissioned in 2016.

Of the 54 operating nuclear power plants, 19 have one reactor, 31 have two reactors, four have three reactors and one has four reactors. The U.S. nuclear energy industry has supplied about 20% of total annual U.S. electricity since 1990.

How do you decommission a nuclear power plant?

We have never decommissioned a nuclear power plant, so the first one will be a precedent setting regulatory process. It looks like the Palisades Nuclear Energy plant located in Covert Township, Michigan on the Lake Michigan shore, will be the first. The beginning of Palisades was nearly six decades ago. Construction started in 1967 and the plant began operation in 1971. The nuclear power plant was owned originally by Consumers Energy and purchased by Entergy in 2006. The following year it was granted renewal of its license to operate which would be current until 2031. But Entergy said the nuclear energy market was no longer viable, stopped operation and sold it for scrap to Holtec in 2022. Holtec then changed from decommissioning to restarting — something that had never been done.

There are two new legal authorities for decommissioning and bringing back into operation these nuclear power plants. The ADVANCE Act of 2024, intended to modernize the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and its processes; and Trump’s Executive Order 14302 Reinvigorating the Nuclear Industrial Base (May 23, 2025). Both support more efficient processes to approve licensing. The executive order specifically addresses “restarts” as important.

In the case of Palisades, they moved from decommissioned status to an operating license. NRC notes in their press release that “while these NRC approvals will allow Holtec to load fuel, there are still several licensing actions under NRC review and additional requirements that need to be met before the plant can start up under the original operating license, which would expire March 24, 2031.”

NRC approved the transfer of all licenses from the previous owner, Entergy to Holtec Decommissioning International LLC to Palisades Energy LLC.

Actions that make a restart viable is the acceptance of previous documents and programs by NRC, including “technical specifications, emergency plan, emergency action levels, and physical security plan, as well as programs for quality assurance, maintenance, and inservice inspections.” They are also using an Environmental Assessment from May 2025 where they made a finding of no significant impact on the environment (FONSI) which means no Environmental Impact Statement is needed.

So Palisades can now receive uranium for its nuclear reactor and begin the process of testing for their operating license. As NRC said, the plan will not open until it is safe and however long that is, is how long it will take. Palisades anticipates to begin operation in 2027 after spending $1.5 billion in renovations (government funded).

What of Three Mile Island?

Meanwhile Three Mile Island is watching the Palisades precedent. Three Mile Island, while decommissioned in 2019, was bought by Constellation to bring it back into operating status. They also expect to spend $1.5 billion to bring it back to operating condition. The renamed Three Mile Island, the Christopher M. Crane Clean Energy Center, has contracted with Microsoft to produce energy exclusively for their data center needs to fuel their artificial intelligence needs for 20 years. They will be selling it for $115-120 per MW, which is above market price of about $110 per GM. The Crane Center anticipates opening in 2028.

From here?

We’ve only just begun (also the title of a hit song released in 1970) to build our nuclear energy capacity with an ambitious goal of quadrupling that capacity. Ensuring these first projects are done safely and without incident is critical. Given we have had almost half a century to improve on safety and efficiency, we are more accepting of the known risks than we were with the unknown risks of the 1970s, with 61% of Americans now favoring nuclear energy. New types of reactors are under development and the new micro-reactor is in the proof of concept stage, but promising.

If we restart these two old and infamous nuclear energy plants built almost half a century ago, we will have achieved a pathway to our carbon free, high volume, consistent production of electricity resource. It seems our love affair with nuclear energy is heating up again for America, ‘cause “breakin up is hard to do” (another song from the 1970s) when it comes to nuclear energy.

The US doesn’t know what it is missing…or just doesn’t realize it.

Chinese automotive giant BYD has established a significant foothold in Europe’s commercial vehicle market, leveraging its electric bus expertise while expanding into freight transport as the continent accelerates its transition to zero-emission transportation.

BYD is in America through purpose-built vehicles, mostly school buses and special application vehicles which are built by the Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation (SMART) Workers Union, Local 105. The number of BYD-platform vehicles produced in the US is relevant to targets under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), which created the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Clean School Bus (CSB) Program to fund electric school buses.

Compare the numbers to what is going in Europe, and there is so much room to grow.

Operating In Most Of Europe

The company’s most visible success has been in electric buses, with BYD vehicles now operating in major European cities, including Amsterdam, Madrid, Barcelona, Budapest, and Milan. This urban presence represents part of BYD’s global deployment of 70,000 electric buses worldwide, though Europe accounts for just 2.5% of that total volume as of early 2022.

BYD faces substantial competition in the European electric bus market, where domestic manufacturers maintain strong positions. In the first half of 2023, Poland’s Solaris, Germany’s MAN, and the BYD-ADL partnership held the top three market positions. However, the overall market is expanding rapidly, with battery-electric bus registrations reaching 5,315 units in the first half of 2025 alone.

The growth trajectory appears sustainable, with Europe’s electric bus market projected to reach $9.44 billion by 2034, driven by environmental regulations and the transition to sustainable public transport. France, the UK, Poland, the Netherlands, and Germany collectively account for more than half of Europe’s current electric bus fleet.

In The Logistics Space

Beyond buses, BYD has developed a comprehensive electric truck lineup for European logistics. The ETM6, a 7.5-ton truck with 200-kilometer range, targets urban delivery operations with payload options of 3,810kg or 3,740kg. Its 255 kWh battery charges from 20% to 100% in two hours, being designed for frequent urban cycles.

The company also offers the ETP3 compact panel van for tight urban spaces, and the EYT 2.0, a heavy-duty port and airport cargo truck capable of handling combined gross weights up to 75 tons for large containers and trailers.

All BYD commercial vehicles use the company’s iron-phosphate Blade Battery technology, which BYD positions as offering superior safety and reliability compared to other lithium-ion chemistries. The vehicles include advanced driver assistance systems such as lane departure warning, forward collision warning, 360-degree vision, and adaptive cruise control.

BYD’s European expansion strategy focuses on establishing local partnerships and adapting to regional logistics needs. The company has recently entered markets like Hungary and maintains an active presence at major industry events such as Germany’s IAA Transportation trade show.

This targeted approach reflects the fragmented nature of global commercial vehicle markets, where regulatory frameworks, infrastructure capabilities, and operational patterns vary significantly between regions. BYD’s European success stems from adapting its electric vehicle expertise to local requirements rather than applying a universal product strategy.

What BYD is doing in Europe contrasts with its strategy in other markets. While the company produces pickup trucks like the Shark for markets in Asia and Latin America, it has not introduced such vehicles in Europe, focusing instead on urban logistics solutions that align with European cities’ emphasis on dense, efficient freight movement.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sweden-bus-img.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 22:00:30.713302

In the United Kingdom, the government has put nuclear power back on the agenda, after decades with no new nuclear developments; however, managing nuclear waste continues to be a major barrier to development.
As more governments welcome a new nuclear era, they must address nuclear waste concerns and establish clear guidelines and regulations on disposal to ensure that all nuclear power companies adhere to strong safety standards and practices.
There are three types of nuclear waste: low-, intermediate-, and high-level radioactive waste.

While some believe they have found sustainable solutions to dispose of nuclear waste, there is still widespread debate around how safe these methods are and the potential long-term impact of waste disposal and storage. In the United Kingdom, the government has put nuclear power back on the agenda, after decades with no new nuclear developments; however, managing nuclear waste continues to be a major barrier to development.

Nuclear waste remains radioactive for around 10,000 years, meaning it is vital that governments dispose of all waste effectively to ensure people and the environment are kept safe in the long term. As more governments welcome a new nuclear era, they must address nuclear waste concerns and establish clear guidelines and regulations on disposal to ensure that all nuclear power companies adhere to strong safety standards and practices.

There are three types of nuclear waste: low-, intermediate-, and high-level radioactive waste. Most of the waste produced at nuclear facilities is lightly contaminated, including items such as tools and work clothing, with a level of around 1 percent radioactivity. Meanwhile, spent fuel is an example of high-level waste, which contributes around 3 percent of the total volume of waste from nuclear energy production. However, this contains around 95 percent of the radioactivity, making adequate waste management of these products extremely important.

In the U.K., the government continues to battle with how best to dispose of its nuclear waste, as it looks to expand the industry over the coming decades. The U.K. has 700,000 cubic metres of radioactive waste from its previous nuclear power activities, a figure that will grow as more nuclear projects come online. The government is now considering the development of a massive underground nuclear dump, known as a geological deposit facility (GDF), to safely dispose of the waste. While no site has been confirmed for development, it is expected to be developed in one of two potential sites in Cumbria, in the north of England.

A U.K. Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson stated, “Constructing the UK’s first geological disposal facility will provide an internationally recognised safe and permanent disposal of the most hazardous radioactive waste.” They added, “Progress continues to be made in areas taking part in the siting process for this multibillion-pound facility, which would bring thousands of skilled jobs and economic growth to the local area.”

However, the U.K. Treasury believes the government’s plan for the waste dump is “unachievable”, rating the project as “red”, or not possible, in a recent assessment. This means that, “There are major issues with project definition, schedule, budget, quality and/or benefits delivery, which at this stage do not appear to be manageable or resolvable. The project may need rescoping and/or its overall viability reassessed.” In addition, there are concerns over the projected project cost, which is expected to be anywhere up to $73 billion.

Richard Outram, the secretary of Nuclear Free Local Authorities, explained, “The Nista red rating is hardly surprising. The GDF process is fraught with uncertainties, and the GDF ‘solution’ remains unproven and costly.”

At present, the U.K. stores most of its nuclear waste at its Sellafield facility in Cumbria, which is viewed as one of the most complex and hazardous nuclear sites worldwide. However, with the planned decommissioning of several power plants and the development of new nuclear facilities, the government must address its imminent waste issue. This is a long-term problem, with it expected to take until 2150 to dispose of the country’s existing waste into a GDF, if one is developed, before disposing of new waste.

In June, Lincolnshire County Council withdrew from being a potential site for the GDF after engaging with communities about the proposal. This is a common problem with developing nuclear waste sites, as the pushback in proposed waste regions often prevents development due to a not-in-my-backyard perspective from residents in the area. It is still unclear whether communities in Cumbria will hold a similar opinion. Corhyn Parr, the CEO of Nuclear Waste Services, said, “A GDF requires a suitable site and a willing community and will only be developed when both are in place.”

Several countries around the globe are battling with how best to dispose of old and new nuclear waste, as a nuclear renaissance is starting to be seen, in line with global aims for a green transition. While nuclear power is now viewed as extremely safe and clean, there are pressing concerns around the adequate disposal of waste, which can be extremely harmful to human health and the environment if improperly managed, that must be rapidly addressed.

The Agency’s action is not a retreat from environmental protection; it is a recognition that the best way to safeguard both people and the planet is through careful, evidence based prioritization.","As environmental attorneys, we are often asked to assist clients in the balance between environmental protection, regulatory authority, and the broader socio economic impacts of government decisions. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s September 3, 2025 withdrawal of its proposed rule revising “effluent limitations guidelines” for the Meat and Poultry Products point source category, in support of the National Pollution and Discharge Elimination System permits program, is a prime example of the Agency exercising its statutory discretion under the Clean Water Act in a way that supports both environmental law and urgent national policy priorities.

Legal Authority and Discretion under the Clean Water Act

The Clean Water Act empowers EPA to establish technology based effluent limitations that reflect the “best available” pollution control technologies for industries that discharge into waters of the U.S. However, the statute also provides the Administrator with discretion to determine whether such revisions are “appropriate,” a critical word in CWA § 304(b). The law expressly requires EPA to consider not only technological feasibility and cost, but also “such other factors as the Administrator deems appropriate.”

Here, EPA reviewed over 5,000 public comments,4,369 mailed submissions and 810 posted electronically, including comments we assisted poultry industry clients in preparing, before determining that revisions to existing regulatory effluent limitations guidelines were not warranted. The decision reflects both statutory compliance and sound administrative judgment. Courts have consistently affirmed that when Congress uses discretionary terms like “appropriate,” agencies have leeway to weigh competing policy concerns, including economic stability, food security, making Americans’ diet healthy again, and unintended environmental tradeoffs.

Why the Withdrawal Matters

The agricultural and farm sector, and in particular the poultry sector on the Delmarva Peninsula, plays an indispensable role in the nation’s food supply. From a legal and policy perspective, EPA’s withdrawal is significant for several reasons:

Protecting the Food Supply: The poultry and meat industries are essential to national food security. In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, ongoing avian flu outbreaks, and supply chain disruptions, EPA recognized that layering new effluent regulations onto this already stressed sector could destabilize production at a time when MAHA has federal agencies working with farmers to ensure the U.S. food supply is healthy, abundant, and affordable, while addressing concerns about pesticides and farming practices.

Inflation and Consumer Prices: Between 2020 and 2024, the nation endured sustained inflation, with food prices among the most sensitive indicators. EPA’s decision explicitly acknowledges that additional regulatory costs would translate into higher prices for consumers at a time when federal policy is prioritizing affordability. This alignment of environmental discretion with economic policy is both lawful and pragmatic.

Avoiding Negative Environmental Tradeoffs: EPA’s analysis revealed that several of the proposed regulatory options would actually worsen environmental and public health outcomes. Tighter water discharge standards would have forced facilities to switch to alternative waste management techniques, such as increased landfilling (e.g., the spread of PFAS through the spreading of sewerage sludge [biosolids] as fertilizer) or incineration, leading to higher air emissions (e.g., where the buildup of nutrients on land releases ammonia into the air) and solid waste burdens. By choosing the “no rule” option, EPA avoided these unintended consequences, a reminder that environmental protection is not always achieved through additional regulation.

Efficient Use of Resources: Agencies must continually prioritize limited resources. Here, EPA made a judgment that its time, staff, and funding should be directed toward initiatives with clearer environmental and human health benefits as well as to Make America Healthy Again. This decision underscores the principle of regulatory triage: focusing on areas where rules will have the greatest positive impact.

Implications for the Delmarva Poultry Industry

For the Delmarva region, home to one of the largest concentrations of poultry production in the country, this withdrawal is a major development. The industry not only supplies Maryland, Delaware, and Virginia, but much of the East Coast with affordable protein but also supports tens of thousands of jobs across farming, processing, transportation, and retail. Had EPA finalized stricter effluent limits, facilities would have faced significant compliance costs at a time when margins are already under pressure from avian flu losses, rising input prices, and labor shortages.

The Agency’s recognition that new standards could compromise the sector’s viability reflects a sophisticated understanding of the interplay between environmental regulation and regional economic health. In effect, EPA is acknowledging that environmental stewardship must coexist with food security, Make America Healthy Again, and rural economic stability.

A Responsible Exercise of Discretion

Critics may argue that this withdrawal represents a step back from water quality protection. But that view ignores two crucial facts:

First, existing effluent limits for the industry remain in place, meaning facilities must continue to comply with established wastewater discharge limits. This is not deregulation; it is a decision not to impose additional Biden era new requirements that the Agency deemed inappropriate at this time.

Second, EPA’s analysis demonstrated that the proposed revisions risked creating greater net harm through secondary pollution impacts. By choosing not to finalize the rule, EPA prevented these negative tradeoffs, a result fully consistent with its statutory mandate to protect human health and the environment.

Conclusion

The EPA’s withdrawal of the proposed Meat and Poultry Products Effluent Limit Revisions is a textbook example of an agency exercising its discretion under the Clean Water Act responsibly and with due consideration of the national interest. The decision reflects a nuanced balancing of environmental protection, food security, making Americans’ diet healthy again, inflationary pressures, and the potential for unintended harms.

For stakeholders, including those in the Maryland, Delaware, and Virginia poultry industry, this action provides much needed regulatory certainty and relief at a time of profound external pressures. More broadly, it demonstrates that environmental law is not static or one dimensional; it must be applied with judgment, humility, and an eye toward the interconnected challenges of our time.

By choosing the “no rule” option here, EPA has honored both the letter and spirit of the Clean Water Act. The Agency’s action is not a retreat from environmental protection; it is a recognition that the best way to safeguard both people and the planet is through careful, evidence based prioritization.

He expects the Gravity to dominate Lucid sales the rest of the year outpacing those of its Air sedan and the company is on track to achieve another record quarter.
On August 14 the company announced the Lucid Gravity Advantage Credit program.
In addition, Lucid launched a new ad campaign last week featuring popular actor Timothee’ Chalamet titled “Driven” to promote the Gravity.
Under the deal, robotaxis will be built by Lucid on the Gravity architecture and operate on Uber’s ride-hailing platform.","As luxury electric vehicle company Lucid Motors prepares to launch its Gravity SUV in Europe, interim CEO Marc Winterhoff is bracing for a fast-approaching deadline in the United States and laying out his strategy for dealing with its after-effects.

That deadline is September 30, when $7,500 federal tax credits on the purchase of qualified EVs disappear.

“We definitely will see an impact, but we have already started to mitigate that,” Winterhoff told reporters during an online briefing last Thursday in advance of this week’s IAA Mobility in Munich, Germany.

The impending evaporation of the tax credit created a rush to showrooms sending EV sales into heady territory, moving just over 130,000 units in July—a 19.7% spike over July, 2024 and 26.4% over June, according to Cox Automotive’s July 2025 EV Market Monitor.

Shoppers grabbed used EVs in big numbers as well, snapping up 36,670 pre-owned vehicles in July, a 40% year-over-year increase.

But the party is likely to be over once the tax incentives go away and dealers are already feeling pessimistic, according to Cox Automotive chief economist Jonathan Smoke who noted, “The outlook for future EV sales really comes as no surprise: Dealers have calendars too; they see the end of government-backed incentives fast approaching and are expecting a slowdown as the market adjusts to a new reality in Q4.”

For Lucid’s deep-pocketed luxury customers $7,500 might not represent a compelling reason to make a quick purchase, but sales for its Gravity SUV have been so strong the company is boosting production through what Winterhoff described as a “steep ramp up” that will continue to the end of the year.

“Our demand is very strong for the Gravity, and is actually outpacing right now, what we can produce,” Winterhoff explained. The top of the line Dream Edition is actually sold out, he revealed.

He expects the Gravity to dominate Lucid sales the rest of the year outpacing those of its Air sedan and the company is on track to achieve another record quarter.

Even with the increase Gravity output, Lucid reduced its 2025 production outlook from 20,000 to 18,000 units, the company said in its second quarter financial report.

That report revealed increasing financial strain on Lucid, showing a Q2 net loss of $855.3 million compared with a $790 million loss during the same three-month period a year ago.

Lucid is planning to create three new “tophats” or variations built on its midsize vehicle platform starting the end of next year, Winterhoff revealed while withholding any details.

He did admit, however, financing the line will eventually need bolstering, reporting, “our funding is enough to get us into the second half of next year. We plan to do the SOP (start of production) of the midsize platform end of next year and then we're ramping up from there. So that tells you that, and everybody actually would know that, that there will be additional funds needed in order to get there. But right now we are until the second half of 2026, well funded.”

On the job about six months after serving as chief operating officer for a year, Winterhoff already installed an aggressive strategy to both cool stress among customers who may feel pressure to buy before September 30 and defend against an expected slowdown in EV sales after that date.

On August 14 the company announced the Lucid Gravity Advantage Credit program. Under the program qualifying lessees who place an order for a Gravity by September 30 and lease between October 1 and December 31 will be eligible to receive a $7,500 Lucid Advantage Credit. Existing qualifying customers are covered as well.

“On top of that, we think that we are well positioned in Q4 and going forward we will obviously provide some incentives in Q4 to make it also for customers a little bit less harsh-- the difference between the with and without the credit,” said Winterhoff.

In addition, Lucid launched a new ad campaign last week featuring popular actor Timothee’ Chalamet titled “Driven” to promote the Gravity.

Looking ahead at the competitive landscape in the U.S. among EV companies, Winterhoff expressed confidence Lucid would maintain its strong position in the luxury segment, saying “right now with the Air, you know, we are in a pretty good spot. I mean, obviously we are planning to stay there. We are planning to do exactly the same with the Gravity as well. We think that we are very competitive with our products.”

Now Lucid is making its biggest move in Europe, announcing at IAA Munich it’s ready to take orders on the Gravity on the Continent.

“We will add additional markets, more than double in the next year, where we go into other European markets,” said Winterhoff. “We're not only going there with the current direct to consumer model that we have. Selected markets we will enter with importers and even in other markets we will add, let's say, dealerships that work as agents for us.”

Beyond retail, Lucid is covering its bets, having just closed a $300 million investment deal with ride hailing giant Uber Technologies Inc. Under the deal, robotaxis will be built by Lucid on the Gravity architecture and operate on Uber’s ride-hailing platform.

The first of those robotaxis is scheduled to go into service late in 2026 in a “major U.S. city,” according to the companies in a September 4 announcement.

Winterhoff is all too aware there are plenty of skeptics about the expected conversion from internal combustion engine vehicles to all- electric, admitting while sales are increasing, it’s at a slower pace than the industry had hoped.

But as he views moves by other automakers such as Ford Motor Co. that just announced it will produce lower cost EVs and upstart Slate, which promises a zero-frills EV in order to boost EV adoption, Winterhoff says Lucid will, in turn, adjust pricing down from its original $100,000-plus price point, but never go down market from its luxury perch.

“Now we are starting at 70, with the mid-size,” he explained. “The plan is to start at around 50 or slightly, slightly below. So that's the area where we where we want to play in but still in the in the premium sector. We’re fully aware that there is strong competition. There always will be but we think that we have a fantastic product and that we are able to compete in that area.”",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68bdd3625fa3a8c6d1814db0/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-09-07 19:01:11.237964

Energy Development Corporation activated its 22-megawatt facility in Sorsogon City on Friday. The Tanawon Geothermal Power Plant took 27 months to build and will produce 159,000 megawatt-hours yearly.

This development is another step forward for the Philippines, which ranks third globally in geothermal power production, per Inquirer.net. The country gets about 56% of its geothermal electricity from EDC's facilities alone.

Geothermal plants tap into Earth's natural heat to create electricity without burning anything. Hot water and steam from underground reservoirs spin turbines that produce power around the clock, regardless of weather conditions.

This technology offers stable electricity prices because it doesn't rely on imported fuels. Cities and businesses can budget more effectively when their power comes from consistent sources rather than fluctuating dirty fuel markets.

The Tanawon plant joins a growing network of renewable facilities helping the Philippines reach its goal of getting 35% of electricity from clean sources by 2030. Currently, renewables provide 22% of the nation's power. Coal still supplies most electricity needs.

Every megawatt of clean energy that replaces coal-fired power means fewer harmful particles in the air. Research has demonstrated that slashing air pollution leads to fewer respiratory problems, heart conditions, and other health issues in surrounding areas.

The new facility strengthens the country's energy independence while creating local jobs. EDC worked with First Balfour Inc. in the Philippines and Japan's Toshiba during construction, bringing technical expertise to the region.

Four additional renewable projects are scheduled to become operational this year, including three battery storage systems and another geothermal plant in Leyte.

These facilities will add more clean capacity to the grid while providing backup power during peak demand.

In New York, according to data from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, it already employs 180,000 people, with buildings and transportation adding the most recent jobs.
More than 90% of new energy capacity that came online in the U.S. in 2024 was clean energy.
While federal policies may do their best to place stumbling blocks in the way, this is New York’s energy future.
Such a bill was passed by the New York State Legislature this year and Gov.","New York’s ambitious climate goals are facing a blizzard of political headwinds. Federal tax credits and funding for green energy projects are disappearing. Fossil fuel companies have spent millions on lobbying efforts to slow down legislation that would forward the state’s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act’s electrification policy. Those efforts seem to be bearing fruit.

This opposition should not deter New York from striving to meet its goals – whether a few years late or not. In the grand scheme of things, the pushback against clean energy is a sadly misinformed blip.

In a recent editorial, the Buffalo News urged the state’s leadership to redouble its efforts in addressing climate change, fully implementing …

Despite a seeming powerhouse of opposition, much of it coming directly from the White House, the clean energy business continues to make strides. Why? It’s simple. The industry makes strong economic sense. In New York, according to data from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, it already employs 180,000 people, with buildings and transportation adding the most recent jobs.

The Buffalo News editorial board recently accused New York of “lagging” in its climate goals, urging state leaders not to “lose their will.” B…

NYSERDA further states that large-scale renewable projects now in the pipeline will add thousands more jobs, as well as spur more than $4.7 billion in private investment. Utility-scale solar and wind are cheaper than fossil fuels, with other technologies quickly becoming more cost competitive. More than 90% of new energy capacity that came online in the U.S. in 2024 was clean energy.

While federal policies may do their best to place stumbling blocks in the way, this is New York’s energy future. State leaders must do their best to mitigate funding losses, fight fear-mongering misinformation and continue to steer the ship. Other states – including Colorado, California and Massachusetts – are facing the same headwinds and are still making progress.

In a recent Editorial Board meeting with NYSERDA President and CEO Doreen Harris and staff members, Harris made it clear that her organization was mission-driven toward that clean energy future.

In an Aug. 17 op-ed for The News, Harris – with Rory Christian, chair of the New York State Public Service Commission – wrote, “New York remains a national leader in renewable energy. The state is home to the country’s only operational utility-scale offshore wind farm, with two more projects moving forward. We reached our 2025 distributed solar goal a full year ahead of schedule, and for two years running we’ve led the nation in community solar deployment.”

These are encouraging words. But it is not encouraging, as stated in New York’s 2025 draft energy plan, that redeploying fossil fuel systems is part of a revised strategy.

Weaning the state off fossil fuels, not adding them back, was the original idea and it still makes sense. New York’s extensive natural gas system releases methane – a potent greenhouse gas – and other harmful chemicals through leaks, especially within low-income neighborhoods, disproportionately affecting Black, Indigenous and people of color. This is especially true in cities like Buffalo, which, like all of New York’s urban centers, is dominated by older housing stock.

Organizations like PUSH Buffalo are working toward state policies that will bring clean energy into the neighborhoods that suffer the most from pollution – both indoors and out. One such policy, eliminating the “100 foot rule” that requires ratepayers to subsidize new gas hookups would help eliminate a financial burden as well as ease the way to a clean energy transition. Such a bill was passed by the New York State Legislature this year and Gov. Kathy Hochul should sign it.

The state should also continue on a path of neighborhood-focused action, like the installation of thermal energy networks and making older buildings more energy-efficient. This work, which helps ordinary people take advantage of healthier energy technology, is just as important as building wind farms and adding more gigawatts to New York’s solar arsenal.

Finally, though preliminary work has advanced the possible implementation of a Cap-and-Invest program that would allow emitters to purchase allowances, this timeline needs to be speeded up. It’s an essential part of funding New York’s transition.

The Vice President recently spent time in Scotland, reportedly using part of his holiday to hold behind closed doors meetings with senior executives from some of the US' largest nuclear energy firms, including Westinghouse, GE Hitachi, X-energy, Holtec International, and TerraPower, the Bill Gates-backed startup.

Though the discussions were officially described as exploratory, sources close to the matter say they lasted nearly twice as long as planned and centered on real-world opportunities for US firms to help meet Britain’s growing energy needs, particularly those driven by the boom in artificial intelligence and data centre expansion. With Trump soon expected to land in the UK for his second state visit taking place from 17 to 19 September, the White House is said to be pushing hard to secure UK government backing for major nuclear infrastructure projects.

Among the headline proposals are a large-scale plant on the island of Anglesey in North Wales, led by Westinghouse, and a fleet of small modular reactors (SMRs) planned by X-energy, which aims to deploy them in industrial areas across the UK, The Telegraph reported.

Days before Trump's visit to the UK, Lord Mandelson, Britain’s ambassador to the US, called for a ""generational evolution"" of the transatlantic alliance, underpinned by new partnerships in energy, AI, and defence.

Speaking at the Ditchley Annual Lecture on September 6, he said: ""President Trump’s second state visit will showcase the best of British traditions and ceremony, but at its core will be new agreements that write the next chapter of transatlantic success; to create jobs, drive innovation, and ensure that British and American ingenuity continues to lead the world.""

He added: ""The Atlantic alliance has prevailed in every great contest of the modern era. Today’s technological competition will be no different, but we must act with the urgency and unity this moment demands.""

Typically, US presidents serving a second term are not invited for full state visits, but this visit comes following a personal invitation from King Charles III, delivered by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer during trade discussions at the White House earlier this year.

Trump, who previously visited in 2019 at the invitation of the late Queen Elizabeth II, described the renewed invitation as a ""great, great honour.""

He will be joined by First Lady Melania Trump and hosted at Windsor Castle, as Buckingham Palace remains under renovation.

The UK government itself has begun streamlining nuclear development. In early 2025, reforms were announced to allow small modular reactors more widely across England and Wales by reducing red tape.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer said back in February: ""This country hasn’t built a nuclear power station in decades. We’ve been let down, and left behind. Our energy security has been hostage to Putin for too long, with British prices skyrocketing at his whims.

""I’m putting an end to it – changing the rules to back the builders of this nation, and saying no to the blockers who have strangled our chances of cheaper energy, growth and jobs for far too long.""",https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/78/1200x630/6410747.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 18:00:21.919147

The shift in policy is expected to save Ford billions in regulatory credits, which it plans to reallocate to gas-powered models and hybrids.
GM has spent $3.5 billion since 2022 purchasing regulatory credits to meet fuel economy and tailpipe emissions requirements.","Detroit's automakers are poised to save billions as Trump's rollback of emissions standards and federal incentives for electric vehicles benefits gas-guzzling cars. General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis are shifting investments from EVs to internal combustion engine vehicles and hybrids. The deregulation clears the way for Detroit's legacy automakers to reallocate billions of dollars earmarked for EVs and pollution rules. The shift in policy has the potential to unlock a multibillion-dollar opportunity over the next two years.

Detroit's major automakers, including General Motors (GM), Ford Motor Company, and Stellantis NV, are set to save billions of dollars as President Trump's rollback of emissions standards and federal incentives for electric vehicles (EVs) benefit gas-guzzling cars. The deregulatory push is clearing the way for these legacy automakers to reallocate billions of dollars earmarked for EVs and pollution rules, unlocking a significant financial opportunity over the next two years.

GM, for instance, has cut its electric-vehicle production plans at two factories and is overhauling a third plant to make gas-fueled pickups instead of battery-powered trucks. Similarly, Ford is moving funds from a canceled three-row electric SUV to future internal combustion engine vehicles and hybrids. Stellantis NV is reviving the thirsty Hemi V-8 engine [2].

The shift in policy is expected to save Ford billions in regulatory credits, which it plans to reallocate to gas-powered models and hybrids. Ford's Chief Executive Officer Jim Farley recently told analysts that the policy change has the potential to unlock a multibillion-dollar opportunity over the next two years [2].

GM has spent $3.5 billion since 2022 purchasing regulatory credits to meet fuel economy and tailpipe emissions requirements. With the rollback, these credits may become less needed, saving GM money. GM's Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson expects the company to save money in 2026 and beyond due to the elimination of fines faced by automakers that fell short of fuel-economy mandates [2].

The US Environmental Protection Agency's proposed rescinding of stringent tailpipe greenhouse gas emissions rules further supports this shift. The EPA's decision and the president's signature on legislation terminating similar regulations set by California are expected to benefit Detroit's automakers significantly [2].

However, the rollback is not without criticism. Environmental advocates argue that the policy change is detrimental to efforts to curb pollution from automobiles, one of the largest contributors to planet-warming emissions. Under President Biden, the EPA's rules were expected to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by about 7 billion metric tons over the life of the program and save drivers about $6,000 in fuel and maintenance costs [2].

Despite the criticism, automakers like GM believe they can capture a bigger slice of the EV market as rivals pull out, but they are happy to do so at a slower rate. GM is operating on just one shift of workers at some factories to build electric vehicles, reflecting the slower demand for EVs [2].

The deregulatory push also includes an aggressive tariff policy that penalizes imported vehicles and parts, imposing steep costs on carmakers. Ford's $1.5 billion savings on credits so far this year nearly offsets the $2 billion net hit to profits it expects to take from tariffs for all of 2025. GM expects about $3 billion in annual costs from tariffs, far more than the roughly $730 million average it has spent on compliance each year since 2022 [2].

In contrast, EV makers like Rivian Automotive Inc. and Tesla Inc. stand to lose significant revenue from the policy changes. Tesla has raked more than $10 billion by selling credits to other automakers since 2020, including more than $1 billion so far this year. Rivian CFO Claire McDonough expects zero revenue from credit sales for the rest of the year as a result of the policy changes [2].

Although not yet finalized, the deregulatory push is clearing the way for Detroit’s legacy automakers and their traditional rivals to reallocate billions of dollars earmarked for EVs and other costs linked to pollution rules. GM has spent $3.5 billion since 2022 purchasing so-called regulatory credits to help the company meet fuel economy and tailpipe emissions requirements – a less-needed currency if Trump’s policies stick.

Ford has similarly cut its own credit-purchase commitments by nearly $1.5 billion this year alone, money it now plans to reallocate to gas-powered models and hybrids.

The shift in policy “has the potential to unlock a multibillion-dollar opportunity over the next two years,” Ford Chief Executive Officer Jim Farley recently told analysts.

Trump’s $3.4 trillion fiscal package sunsets the $7,500 tax credit for EV buyers on Sept. 30. It also zeroed out fines faced by automakers that fell short of fuel-economy mandates, negating the need to buy credits under those rules. Stellantis paid $190 million in penalties in each of the last two years.

Eliminating the fines “will save us money in 2026 and beyond for sure,” GM Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson told investors last month.

Separately, the US Environmental Protection Agency has proposed rescinding stringent rules limiting tailpipe greenhouse gas emissions from cars and the president signed legislation effectively terminating similar regulations set by California.

Conclusion The Trump-era emissions rollback provided Detroit’s legacy automakers with a strategic reprieve, enabling them to prioritize ICE profitability and reallocate capital away from costly electrification initiatives.","The Trump administration’s sweeping emissions rollback (2017–2021) reshaped the U.S. auto industry’s strategic calculus, enabling Detroit’s legacy automakers to prioritize internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles over costly electrification initiatives. By freezing fuel economy standards at 2020 levels through model year 2026 and weakening greenhouse gas (GHG) regulations, the administration created a regulatory environment that directly incentivized capital reallocation toward ICE production. This shift, while controversial, has yielded measurable financial gains for General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis, offering critical insights for investors navigating the sector’s evolving landscape.

Regulatory Reprieve and Strategic Reorientation

The Trump-era policy framework, epitomized by the 2018 “Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) Vehicles Rule,” effectively suspended the Obama-era mandate for annual improvements in fuel efficiency. By pegging standards to 2020 levels, the administration reduced compliance costs for automakers, particularly for large SUVs and trucks—vehicles that historically generate the highest profit margins. According to a report by the Harvard Environmental Law Program, this move “freed automakers from the need to invest in costly technologies to meet stricter targets,” allowing them to redirect capital toward ICE platforms [1].

For Detroit’s Big Three, this regulatory flexibility translated into a strategic reorientation. General Motors, for instance, scaled back its EV R&D budget in 2019, shifting focus to mid-size trucks and SUVs, which accounted for over 60% of its U.S. sales by 2020 [2]. Similarly, Ford’s decision to discontinue the low-selling Fusion sedan in 2021—replacing it with a new Bronco SUV—was framed as a response to “consumer demand and regulatory clarity” under the Trump rules [3]. Stellantis, then Fiat-Chrysler, similarly prioritized ICE models, with CEO Jim Ackerman noting in 2020 that the company’s “profitability hinges on large, fuel-efficient ICE vehicles in a less regulated environment” [4].

ICE Profitability Metrics and Capital Reallocation

The financial impact of this shift is evident in the automakers’ earnings reports. Ford’s F-150 pickup, a gas-powered model, generated a 20% operating margin in 2020—nearly double the industry average for EVs [5]. GM’s Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban, both ICE-based, contributed $3.2 billion in pre-tax profits in 2019, a 15% increase from 2017 [6]. These figures underscore the profitability of ICE vehicles under relaxed regulations, even as automakers publicly committed to electrification goals.

Capital reallocation further amplified these gains. Between 2017 and 2021, Detroit’s Big Three reduced combined EV R&D spending by 18%, reallocating $4.3 billion to ICE production lines and plant upgrades [7]. For example, Ford’s $7.2 billion investment in its Blue Oval City plant in Tennessee (announced in 2021) was initially earmarked for EVs but was partially redirected to expand F-150 production capacity [8]. Stellantis similarly repurposed a $1.5 billion facility in Michigan to focus on Ram trucks, citing “regulatory certainty and consumer preference for ICE vehicles” as key drivers [9].

Risks and Long-Term Considerations

While the Trump-era policies bolstered short-term ICE profitability, they also delayed critical investments in electrification. A 2021 analysis by BloombergNEF noted that Detroit’s Big Three lagged behind Tesla and European rivals in EV battery production capacity, a gap that widened during the Trump years [10]. Additionally, the administration’s 2025 auto tariffs—imposed under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act—introduced new headwinds, with the Detroit Three facing an estimated $108 billion in combined costs by 2025 [11]. These tariffs, coupled with the Biden administration’s subsequent reversal of Trump-era emissions rules, have created regulatory volatility that complicates long-term planning.

Strategic Implications for Investors

For investors, the interplay between regulatory shifts and capital allocation highlights the importance of hedging against policy uncertainty. Detroit’s legacy automakers have demonstrated resilience by leveraging ICE profitability to fund future electrification efforts, but their reliance on a deregulated environment remains a double-edged sword. As the Biden administration tightens emissions standards and states like California enforce zero-emission vehicle mandates, the window for ICE dominance may narrow.

Conclusion

The Trump-era emissions rollback provided Detroit’s legacy automakers with a strategic reprieve, enabling them to prioritize ICE profitability and reallocate capital away from costly electrification initiatives. While this approach delivered short-term gains, it also exposed the industry to regulatory and market risks. For investors, the key takeaway is clear: the auto sector’s future hinges on balancing ICE resilience with agile adaptation to evolving policy landscapes.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-07 19:02:01.004918

Advantages of Electric Cars

Electric vehicles offer significant benefits for drivers beyond just lower prices. The advantages range from saving money over time to helping reduce pollution in our communities.

Cost Efficiency

Electric cars tend to be more budget-friendly for day-to-day driving compared to gas vehicles. This is primarily due to their superior efficiency and lower energy costs.

While the purchase price of EVs is typically higher than similar conventional vehicles, this gap is narrowing. Many manufacturers have been cutting EV prices in recent years, making them more accessible.

The long-term savings are substantial. EVs have:

Lower fuel costs (electricity vs. gasoline)

Reduced maintenance expenses (fewer moving parts)

No oil changes required

Less brake wear due to regenerative braking

In most cases, an EV will cost less over its lifetime despite the higher upfront cost. Federal tax incentives and rebates further improve the financial equation for many buyers.

Environmental Benefits

Electric vehicles produce zero tailpipe emissions, which helps improve local air quality. This direct reduction in pollution is especially important in urban areas where traffic congestion contributes to smog and health issues.

The overall environmental impact depends on how electricity is generated in a region. Areas with cleaner power grids (more renewables, less coal) see greater benefits from EV adoption.

EVs are becoming increasingly cleaner as:

Power grids add more renewable energy sources

Battery production becomes more efficient

Battery recycling improves

The reduced noise pollution is another advantage. Electric motors operate much more quietly than internal combustion engines, creating less noise in neighborhoods and cities.

Even when considering manufacturing impacts and electricity sources, most EVs have a lower lifetime carbon footprint than comparable gas vehicles.

Key Features to Consider

When shopping for a budget-friendly electric vehicle, certain features can make a big difference in your ownership experience. Understanding what matters most will help you find an EV that fits your needs without breaking the bank.

Battery Life and Range

Range anxiety remains one of the top concerns for potential EV buyers. Most affordable electric cars now offer between 100-250 miles of range per charge, which is sufficient for daily commuting and occasional longer trips.

The Niro EV offers decent range while maintaining a relatively lower price point compared to premium models. When evaluating battery performance, look beyond just the maximum range number.

Consider these important battery factors:

Degradation rate – how quickly the battery loses capacity over time

Temperature performance – how extreme cold or heat affects range

Warranty coverage – most manufacturers offer 8-10 year battery warranties

Battery chemistry – newer LFP batteries often last longer than older technologies

Real-world range often differs from EPA estimates. Cold weather, highway speeds, and using climate control can reduce range by 20-40%.

Safety Features

Even budget EVs should include essential safety systems. Many affordable electric vehicles come with advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) that were once found only in luxury models.

Basic features like A/C and GPS are expected, but safety should be prioritized when selecting budget-friendly electric cars. Look for these key safety elements:

Automatic emergency braking

Lane keeping assistance

Blind spot monitoring

Multiple airbags

High crash test ratings

Many EVs have inherent safety advantages due to their design. The low center of gravity from floor-mounted batteries improves stability, while the absence of a traditional engine creates larger crumple zones.

Charging Infrastructure

Access to convenient charging is crucial for daily EV use. Before purchasing, evaluate your charging options at home and on regular travel routes.

Home charging provides significant cost benefits, allowing you to power up overnight when electricity rates are often lower. Consider these charging considerations:

Home charging options:

Level 1 (120V): 3-5 miles of range per hour

Level 2 (240V): 15-35 miles of range per hour

Public charging access:

DC Fast Chargers: 80% charge in 30-60 minutes

Network compatibility with your vehicle

Charging speeds your vehicle supports

Most affordable EVs now offer fast-charging capability, but charging speeds vary significantly between models. Check if your vehicle includes a heat pump, which improves efficiency in cold weather.

Why Is An EV Road User Charge Being Pursued?
An option that seems to have significant support, even among some EV advocacy organisations, is a universal road user charge based on vehicle mass1 × distance travelled.
For example, the Australian Electric Vehicle Association (AEVA) is supportive of a road user charge.
AEVA National President Dr Chris Jones said that even under a universal road user charge, Australia’s fuel excise2 should remain in place.","Federal Treasurer Jim Chalmers met with his state/territory counterparts on Friday to discuss (among other things) a potential road user charge (RUC) for electric vehicles.

What Was The Outcome Of The Meeting?

An options paper was put together for the meeting, a goal of which was for state and territory treasurers to “agree or to discuss some principles behind this policy design”.

What was in that paper isn’t clear. But the treasurers were in general agreement about the need for reforms to road user charging arrangements for electric vehicles, and that those reforms should be designed not to impede EV uptake.

“The reforms to the treatment of electric vehicles will ensure more equitable treatment across vehicle types and provide certainty to support investment,” says a (brief) joint statement from the meeting. “The design of reforms should be as simple as possible and minimise administration and compliance burden. We will ensure any changes are phased to enable the productivity, climate and consumer benefits of increasing electric vehicle uptake over the coming years.”

In a separate summary of the meeting, which also identified the need for reduction or removal of regulations that disadvantage electric heavy vehicles, Treasurer Chalmers said:

“The Commonwealth will progress work with the states and territories and take the time to get the policy development right.”

So, it appears this will still be a ‘Pantene’ process – it won’t happen overnight, but it will happen.

Why Is An EV Road User Charge Being Pursued?

EV owners avoid paying fuel excise and plug-in hybrid owners only pay it when they top-up at the pump. Fuel excise helps pay for road projects and maintenance — sort of. Collected by the federal government, fuel excise goes into general/consolidated revenue; where it can be spent on just about anything.

“Universal” RUC Missing In Action

The seismic shift that will be brought about by electric vehicles also means a seismic shift is needed in how we fund roads. An option that seems to have significant support, even among some EV advocacy organisations, is a universal road user charge based on vehicle mass1 × distance travelled.

For example, the Australian Electric Vehicle Association (AEVA) is supportive of a road user charge.

“… but only if it’s part of a wider reform of road-related revenue collection which applies to all vehicles regardless of their fuel source. This is particularly relevant as conventional hybrids are primarily responsible for the decline in fuel excise collected form [sic] petrol sales, yet such vehicles would not be captured under an EV-specific RUC.”

However, based on the Friday meeting statement, it doesn’t appear a universal RUC approach is being considered (yet).

What About The Fuel Excise’s Future?

AEVA National President Dr Chris Jones said that even under a universal road user charge, Australia’s fuel excise2 should remain in place.

“An EV and a diesel vehicle of identical weight and annual mileage should pay the same sum for use of the roads,” he said. “But the diesel vehicle should pay something extra for the noise, harmful pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. Fortunately, fuel excise captures that perfectly already.”

And the AEVA says while the RUC should be set by the federal government, state and territory transport departments should administer the scheme and retain all revenue for road maintenance.

The Federal Treasurer reportedly isn’t keen on a universal road user charge *and* fuel excise existing side-by-side as he considers this a double-tap tax for internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle owners. But that’s the point: a “polluter pays” approach would make ICE ownership less desirable; although there are significant social and other implications to consider.",https://www.solarquotes.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/chalmers-ev-ruc.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 17:00:33.381209

Audi moves forward by looking back

The Audi Concept C previews what a future electric sports car from the automaker could look like, but its design is firmly rooted in the past. Audi claims inspiration from throughout its history, ranging from the 1936 Auto Union Type C race car that served as a Nazi propaganda tool, to the third-generation 2004 Audi A6 sedan that has served as the brand’s styling template for the past 20 years.

The Concept C’s long hood and hunchback rear give it a similar silhouette to the Type C. The 1930s race car had its engine behind the driver, but it’s unclear what this all-electric concept car is hiding under that vented rear cowl. The Millennial influence is also apparent in the minimalist, unadorned surfaces. Like a mid-2000s Apple product, the Concept C looks like it was hewn from a solid chunk of metal. The minimalist theme continues inside, where a 10.4-inch display screen folds away when not in use so as not to ruin the clean lines of the dashboard. Physical controls are well integrated and made from anodized aluminum for a quality feel, while indirect ambient lighting “enhances the interior design’s evident solidity,” according to Audi.

This concept’s main purpose is to show off the next evolution of Audi design, so technical details weren’t disclosed. Audi did say that the Concept C previews a future production model, which could be paired with the expected EV replacements for the Porsche 718 Boxster and 718 Cayman sports cars.

BMW goes back to school

BMW unveiled the first of its next-generation “Neue Klasse” EVs at its hometown show, and SUV called the iX3 that’s close in size to the automaker’s current bestseller — the gasoline X3. Named after a family of models that helped save the company in the 1960s and 1970s, the Neue Klasse (German for “new class”) is a complete EV rethink for BMW.

In iX3 50 xDrive launch guise, this electric SUV will have a pair of motors generating 463 horsepower and 476 pound-feet of torque, getting it from zero to 60 mph in a BMW-estimated 4.7 seconds. For this dual-motor powertrain, BMW opted for a front asynchronous motor and rear electrically exited synchronous motor for what the automaker claims is improved efficiency. The battery pack is made up of cylindrical cells assembled without modules (known as cell-to-pack), while the pack itself is more closely integrated with the vehicle structure.

The new cells improve energy density by 20%, crucial for hitting BMW’s targeted 400 miles of range. BMW also claims a 30% improvement in charging speed compared to its current-generation EVs, allowing the iX3 to recover 230 miles of range in 10 minutes when DC fast charging at its full 400-kilowatt capacity. The iX3 marks BMW’s switch to the North American Charging Standard (NACS), but a free Combined Charging Standard (CCS) adapter will be provided.

The Neue Klasse models also have a streamlined electrical architecture based around four “superbrain” computers, which reduces the weight of these components by 30% and eliminates 2,000 feet of wiring, BMW claims. One of the four computers, called the “Heart of Joy” will integrate powertrain and chassis functions for better driving dynamics, while another will handle driver aids, including a “symbiotic” mode that blends manual and automated control inputs.

The iX3 itself features fresh styling, with a thin vertical grille that harkens back to this EV’s Neue Klasse namesakes from the 1960s. Inside, a dashboard-spanning display, next-generation head-up display, and voice assistant are included. The iX3 is scheduled to reach the United States in summer 2026, with prices starting around $60,000.

Mercedes’ star shines even brighter

In contrast to BMW, Mercedes-Benz is moving away from dedicated EVs and focusing on electric versions of combustion models. That strategy has already rolled out with the electric G-Class SUV and CLA-Class compact, and continues with an electric version of the GLC-Class SUV that could be one of the BMW iX3’s closest rivals.

Officially the GLC with EQ Technology, the EV looks a lot like a gasoline GLC, but with bigger, illuminated grille and the Mercedes-star headlights from the CLA. However, the electric version also has a 3.3-inch longer wheelbase that increases headroom and legroom in both rows of seats, plus a 4.5-cubic-foot frunk.

Full specs will be released closer to the electric GLC’s arrival in the U.S. late next year, but Mercedes estimates up to 483 hp and 443 miles of range from a 94-kilowatt-hour battery pack using new cell chemistry. An 800-volt electrical architecture allows for even faster DC fast charging, with the ability to recover up to 188 miles of range in 10 minutes, according to Mercedes. A “One-Box” braking system integrates the friction and regenerative braking for better feel, while available rear-axle steering and air suspension should improve agility and comfort, respectively.

Inside, you’ll find a panoramic glass roof with switchable electrochromic glass to block out excessive rays, and a 39.1-inch dashboard display comprised of a 10.25-inch instrument cluster, 14-inch central touchscreen, and 14-inch front-passenger touchscreen. It runs the new Mercedes-Benz Operating System (MB.OS) and Mercedes-Benz User Experience (MBUX) infotainment software that debuted in the CLA, with a cacophony of voice assistants. ChatGPT4o with Bing search and Google Cloud’s Automotive AI Agent are both onboard, along with Mercedes’ own virtual assistant.

Porsche lets you charge a car like a smartphone

Porsche’s biggest announcement was a new generation of 911 Turbo that adds a hybrid powertrain to the legendary sports car. But Porsche also had some news for those who disdain cars without plugs, announcing that the upcoming Cayenne Electric will be available with wireless charging — a much-discussed EV feature that’s failed to gain traction with automakers until now.

Instead of having to drag cables around, drivers will be able to simply park the Cayenne Electric over a wireless charging pad, which will transmit electricity to a receiver mounted on the underside of the vehicle between the front wheels. Porsche claims this system will be able to transmit power at 11 kW — about the same as many conventional onboard AC chargers — over a gap of four to six inches. Charging will start automatically once the car is in position, and a special camera view will help drivers to do that. Porsche also promises similar features to conventional charging, including cabin preconditioning, departure scheduling, and integration with the My Porsche app.

Several aftermarket companies offer wireless-charging hardware that can be retrofitted to EVs, but that doesn’t offer the seamless integration of a system available from the factory. But aside from some Chinese-market vehicles and South Korean-market versions of the Genesis GV60, such integration isn’t available. Porsche could be the first automaker to offer wireless charging at scale, across multiple markets. It plans to launch the system in Europe in 2026, followed by “other markets around the world.”",https://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pre-media_25c0192_101.jpeg?resize=1200%2C630&p=1,N,,2025-09-07 18:00:54.721590

You need something equally as wild as the AMG GT XX to flow a whole ass megawatt of power into a car.","Mercedes-Benz is on a mission to change the electric vehicle world with its AMG GT XX concept. It already has 25 different world records under its belt, but the feat it just achieved might be the most impressive so far: The GT XX can accomplish 1 megawatt charging with just a single cable. At a prototype charging station, the concept vehicle achieved over 1,000 kilowatts (that equals 1 megawatt) of charging power thanks to its axial flux motors and direct-cooled battery. These two pieces of tech aren't just some far-off idea, either — they're expected to reach series production with the production version of the GT XX that will debut next year riding on the AMG.EA high-performance EV architecture.

The car was able to achieve a maximum charging speed of 1,041 kW during megawatt charging. Mercedes says the power was available just 0.5 seconds after charging started, and it was able to maintain at least 1,000 kW for about two and a half minutes. Up to 1,176 amps of current was able to flow through a specially designed CCS charging cable, transmitting 17.3 kWh of juice in just one minute. That's the equivalent of 78 miles of range in the WLTP cycle. In EPA terms, that's at least 55 to 60 miles, which is pretty incredible.

Mercedes says a lot of what makes these sorts of ludicrous charging speeds possible is the design of the 3,000 battery cells inside the AMG GT XX that were developed in-house in Affalterbach and inspired by Formula 1 tech. They make use of cylindrical NCMA cells that have a tall, slim design that allows for efficient cooling and high energy density. Their laser-welded aluminum cell housing also improves conductivity when it comes to both current and heat, meaning they can charge faster for longer.

The company put a lot of thought into the AMG GT XX's cooling system and its ability to dissipate heat quickly enough to support these sorts of nutty charging speeds (let alone support the kind of power the car produces). Intelligent thermal management is pinpoint accurate when it comes to controlling the pack's temperature to make sure everything is performing at tip-top shape — even during intensive use.

Of course, you can't pop over to your run-of-the-mill Tesla Supercharger or Electrify America hub and get these sorts of numbers. You need something equally as wild as the AMG GT XX to flow a whole ass megawatt of power into a car. That's why Mercedes teamed up with European charging company Alpitronic to come up with something more extreme. The station used for this test was apparently originally designed for commercial trucks, but it was converted into a system that worked with smaller CCS cables.

Don't worry, that isn't some one-off experiment, either. Mercedes and Alpitronic say their findings will relate directly to the development of new high-performance chargers in both Europe and North America. Folks, we're getting dangerously close to the moment when EVs can fill up just as fast as gas-powered cars. What will electric vehicle doomers say then? In any case, what a cool world we're living in, isn't it?",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/mercedes-amg-gt-xx-concept-charges-at-1-megawatt-basically-as-fast-as-filling-up-a-gas-powered-car/l-intro-1757255065.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 16:00:53.176062

The good news is that the $7,500 federal credit isn't the only available incentive.","You've probably read by now that the $7,500 tax credits for buying an EV are going away at the end of September. To be clear, this isn't a restructuring of the EV credits, they're not just changing which cars are eligible for the full amount. President Trump is simply taking the federal EV credits off the table entirely.

We were able to get some insight on the matter from John Vincent, Senior Editor/Vehicle Testing for U.S. News & World Report, who had the following to say: “Automakers are steadily building their lineups of EVs and will still have electric cars to sell after September 30. I’d look for them to substantially drop prices or offer incentives, though they might not make up for the entire loss of the federal tax credit. I think the best bet if you’re a shopper: Buy now to ensure your access to the savings. So there you have it, if you were waiting for an excuse to buy an EV, this is one of the best you're ever going to get, and here's why we think the Hyundai Ioniq 5 is the right choice.

Why The Hyundai Ioniq 5?

In our latest roundup of new 2025 EVs, we put the Hyundai Ioniq 5 right at the top of the list, above some stellar vehicles like the BMW iX, the Audi Q8 e-Tron, and even the Porsche Taycan.

To take a quick look at the specs...

These numbers are all over the place, because Hyundai really does have an Ioniq 5 for every price range. The Ioniq 5 SE Standard Range is a 168-horse rear-wheel drive model that will start you out at $42,600, or just $35,100 if you qualify for the full $7,500 EV credit. Move your way up the ladder, and you've got the 225-hp $49,600 SEL, with 318 miles of all-electric range in the rear-wheel drive model, and the $54,300 320-hp all-wheel drive Limited, with an electric range of 269 miles.

A Surprisingly Potent Family SUV

Whatever you're after, there's an Ioniq 5 to suit your needs at a price you can live with. But, we wouldn't be recommending it if we didn't actually like it. The all-wheel drive models are capable of 0-60 times in the five-second range, and the athletic powertrain and responsive handling make for a family car that's actually fun to drive.

If you were to ask us to nitpick the Ioniq 5: the steering feedback is definitely a bit numb, and the suspension is cushy to the point of being almost floaty. It's not the most driver-oriented car, but that's not really what you're after in a mid-range family SUV.

The EV Credits Don't Just Apply To Leased Models

The Hyundai Ioniq 5 has been on and off the list of cars eligible for the EV credit. Right now, Hyundai lists the following Ioniq models as qualifying for the full $7,500.

2025 Ioniq 5 SE Standard Range with model code 1402REZ

2025 Ioniq 5 SE All-Wheel Drive with model code 51412AEZ

2025 Ioniq 5 SE Rear-Wheel Drive with model code 51412REZ

2025 Ioniq 5 Limited Rear-Wheel Drive with model code 51462REZ

2025 Ioniq 5 XRT with model code 51452AEZ

2025 Ioniq 5 XRT All-Wheel Drive with tow hitch with model code 514C2AEZ

2026 Ioniq 9 (all trims, powertrains and model codes)

At present, Hyundai lists these models as being eligible for the full $7,500 EV credit for purchase. To quote the website directly...

Eligible customers who purchase a new 2026 IONIQ 9 or a select new 2025 IONIQ 5 vehicle from a participating, IRS-registered dealer may qualify for a federal tax credit of up to $7,500. The tax credit may be applied at point of sale or applied against customer’s annual income tax liability.

The 2026 Ioniq 9 is currently the only 2026 model eligible for the EV credit, and the list doesn't include a single 2024 model. So if you want an Ioniq 5, you're looking for a 2025 model in particular. The good news is that almost every configuration is covered, so you should be able to claim the credit no matter what you're after.

Supplies Are Limited

You'll want to move fast, not just because the credits are disappearing, but because EVs are flying off the lots right now. Checking in with U.S. News & World Report's John Vincent once more, the Senior Editor told us:

“Demand for new cars has been artificially boosted for the last several months, first with shoppers trying to beat the Trump import taxes, and now by the expiring federal EV tax credit. Unless automakers juice the market with generous incentives, the fourth quarter could see significant weakness.”

Time Is Literally Running Out

Let's say you're waiting for that Christmas bonus from work before you decide to take the plunge on an EV, or you'd rather drive a 2026 model. Whatever the case, you're not buying until October, at the earliest, which means that you're going to miss out on the $7,500 credit... What then?

State-Level Incentives Remain, But Are Unlikely To Match The Federal EV Credit Dollar-For-Dollar

The bad news is that this is it for the full $7,500 federal EV credit. If it's ever coming back, it's unlikely to be anytime in the next three and a half years. The good news is that the $7,500 federal credit isn't the only available incentive. In fact, California has promised to match the $7,500 amount at a state-level to make up the difference. Drivers in other states, though, might have to settle for what they can get. According to John Vincent...

Many states already have incentive programs for EV buyers, but $7,500 per vehicle is a lot for a state to offer. The high-tax economic powerhouse of California may be able to fund such a program, but I doubt many other states can. Oregon, for example, a state politically similar to California, offers up to a $5,000 rebate toward the purchase of an EV. However, Oregon’s EV rebate funding consistently runs out early in the year, and even it can’t muster the political will to extend the program.”

There are simply too many obstacles in the way of state-level EV credits matching the outgoing federal credit. States that have the political support might not have the money for such incentives, and states that have the money might not have the political support.

Between state-level EV incentives and dealer mark-downs to make up for sales lost to the expiring EV credits, it's not impossible to think that you might wind up cobbling together a total discount roughly equal to the $7,500 federal credit. But you can't count on it. If you want a guaranteed, federal-government-backed $7,500 discount off the price of purchase, you've got about a month left to sign on the dotted line, and that's it.",https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-hyundai-ioniq-5-xrt.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-07 16:00:16.520148

On the European WLTP cycle, Mercedes says the GLC EV can travel up to 443 miles on a full charge.
For the most part, the GLC EV looks like a pretty conventional Mercedes-Benz crossover, though it's not nearly as blob-like as the EQE SUV.
Mercedes says the GLC EV will have 20.1 cubic feet of cargo room behind the rear seats, which isn't bad but is a bit less than the gas GLC.
But overall, the GLC EV isn't that much bigger than the gas While the outside of the GLC EV is evolutionary, its inside could very well be considered revolutionary.","The Mercedes-Benz GLC has been the German automaker's best-selling model for years at this point, and that trend is only going to continue as compact luxury crossovers get more popular, but the GLC has been missing something: an electric powertrain. Thus far, we've only gotten internal-combustion-powered GLCs, as the EQC never made it to our shores, but that all changes with the new GLC with EQ Technology (which I'll be calling the GLC EV from here on out). Not only is it a reinvention of Mercedes' most important model, it's also a North Star for where the automaker is headed in the future.

The GLC EV brings with it a slew of new technologies and features we're sure to see on other Mercedes-Benz vehicles, especially as it's the first car on the all-new MB.EA electric vehicle architecture. It also has an AI-driven MB.OS supercomputer to run everything, a totally redesigned cabin with a massive 39.1-inch seamless screen, even better driver-assist systems, and an exterior that blends forward-thinking design elements with nods to past iconic Mercedes-Benz models. There's a lot to like here. Let's dig in.

Underneath the skin of the GLC EV is the all-new 800-volt MB.EA architecture that Mercedes first started telling us about a few years ago. In the U.S. we're going to get two drivetrain options at launch: the rear-wheel-drive GLC300+ and the all-wheel-drive GLC400 4Matic. Mercedes says the GLC300+ will put out 369 horsepower and 372 pound-feet of torque from its single motor. That's good enough for a 5.9-second 0-to-60-mph run. The dual-motor GLC400 bests both those numbers by quite a lot, coming in at 483 hp and 596 lb-ft and dropping the claimed 0-60 time to just 4.4 seconds. Either way you get a 130-mph top speed.

Both models have a 94-kWh battery pack and can DC fast charge at up to 330 kW, and there's an integrated DC converter so they can charge at both 800-volt and 400-volt stations. Mercedes says it can charge from 10% to 80% in about 24 minutes, and about 150 miles of range can be added in just 10 minutes. On the European WLTP cycle, Mercedes says the GLC EV can travel up to 443 miles on a full charge. WLTP is more optimistic than the EPA's test, so I'd hazard that our range will be somewhere around the 390-400 mile mark.

It also comes as standard with selectable one-pedal driving. Mercedes knows this is going to be a lot of buyers' first EV, so it wants to ease everyone into it slowly. Up to 300 kW of regeneration is possible, and Mercedes says the GLC recuperates during ""over 99%"" of braking.

Like with the Porsche Taycan, Mercedes went with the two-speed transmission in an effort to optimize both performance and efficiency. First gear has a short ratio of 11:1, which gives the GLC EV quick acceleration, high towing capacity (up to 5,291 pounds) and more efficiency around town. Second gear (5:1) is designed for power delivery at higher speeds — like accelerating from an on ramp all the way up to its 130 mph top speed on the autobahn — and efficiency in highway driving. Air suspension is optional, as is rear-wheel steering that turns up to 4.5 degrees.

When you're on the highway, you'll be able to enjoy Mercedes' standard suite of driver-assist technologies that will only get better with time as they are improved with over-the-air updates. The GLC has up to ten cameras, twelve ultrasonic sensors and five radar sensors.

When it comes to the outside of the GLC EV, the first thing you're going to notice is the biggest thing, that eye-catching grille up front that Mercedes says both ""marks an important milestone and redefines the face of the brand."" The ""grille"" has a wide chrome frame, a smoked-glass-look mesh structure and integrated contour lighting. Of course, there's an illuminated version available that you simply must get, which comes with 942 polycarbonate backlit dots, as well as an illuminated three-pointed star.

Other than the grille, the GLC EV isn't that wild-looking. That isn't to say it's not a handsome crossover — it definitely is, but it's fairly conservative by modern EV standards. For the most part, the GLC EV looks like a pretty conventional Mercedes-Benz crossover, though it's not nearly as blob-like as the EQE SUV. It's a nice mix between gas-powered crossovers like the existing GLC and the EQ models.

As will become standard new Mercedes-Benz fare, the headlights have three-pointed-star-shaped running lights, and the taillight bar contains small encircled star LEDs like on the recent GT XX concept. The car also comes with plenty of chrome to keep even the most traditional Mercedes fan happy, and there's a small roof spoiler at the top of the trunk to help with aerodynamics and disguise the GLC EV's sloping roofline. Mercedes says the GLC has a drag coefficient of 0.26, which is pretty good but slightly off the mark of the newly released BMW iX3, which will be the GLC's biggest competitor. You can get up to 21-inch wheels if you aren't too worried about the car's range, but 20s come as standard.

The GLC EV's 117-inch wheelbase is 3.9 inches longer than the gas-powered GLC, and because of other clever EV packaging, interior room grows for everyone. Front and rear occupants get an extra 0.5 inches and 1.9 inches of legroom, respectively, and rear headroom is up 0.6 inches, thanks in part to the standard panoramic roof.

Mercedes says the GLC EV will have 20.1 cubic feet of cargo room behind the rear seats, which isn't bad but is a bit less than the gas GLC. If that's not enough, electrically drop the 40:20:40-split second row and the space grows to a healthy 61.4 cubic feet, more than the ICE model, and the cargo floor can be lowered by 3.1 inches. If you need just a bit more space, there's a standard frunk with an extra 4.5 cubic feet of room. But overall, the GLC EV isn't that much bigger than the gas

While the outside of the GLC EV is evolutionary, its inside could very well be considered revolutionary. The big news here is the available 39.1-inch MBUX Hyperscreen, the largest display fitted to a Mercedes to date. Made up of over 1,000 individual LEDs, it combines gauge cluster, central infotainment screen and passenger display into one seamless screen that spans the whole dashboard. Intelligent dimming technology will allow for simultaneous adjustment of different sections, like if the passenger wants their side to be darker.

Mercedes says the screen can show ""high-resolution ambient styles"" as background motifs that are meant to offer a wide range of moods to the folks in the car, ""from calm to intense, cool to warm, and technical to emotional."" In addition to changing the graphics and colors across the screen, these moods also change the ambient lighting.

Mercedes-Benz

The infotainment system is an evolution of the new MBUX that debuted on the CLA, with simpler menus and better graphics than the old cars. It even has an AI virtual assistant thing with ChatGPT4o and Microsoft Bing Search that'll be your friend if you don't have one, but I really think you should try to find one.

The GLC EV's interior is about more than a big screen, though. Mercedes made it a point of emphasis to bring back buttons and knobs on both the steering wheel and center console (they live right by a pair of wireless phone chargers), replacing the haptic buttons that were previously there. It's also putting a bigger emphasis on trim and materials — the floating wood piece that follows the dash and center console is huge, the air vents are more intricate, and the door panels have more complex designs.

Of course, like all modern Mercedes-Benz models, the GLC EV's interior is festooned with all of the ambient lighting you could ever want that can be changed to 11 trillion different colors and even pulse and change along with the music. That ambient lighting can also show up on the panoramic roof, which, as an option, is covered in 162 three-pointed stars, a very neat trick.

Mercedes says the GLC EV is going to be offered with a whole slew of sustainable materials meant to create a high-quality feel in the car's interior, including the first interior certified by The Vegan Society, if that's the sort of thing you're into. If you're not, you can also choose from black, beige or brown leather options that can be paired with all sorts of lovely trim options from anthracite or metallic-blended fabric to AMG carbon fiber and birch wood. It's a Mercedes. You've got lots of options.

If you're not feeling that massive screen, you can also go for the MBUX Superscreen that separates the three zones into separate screens like on the CLA: a 10.25-inch driver display, a 14-inch infotainment screen and a 14-inch passenger display. The base GLC EV doesn't have the passenger display; instead it gets a panel with more illuminated stars.

The AMG version of the GLC EV isn't getting revealed yet, but that hasn't stopped Mercedes from offering several different AMG appearance packages on the car. You can option the GLC EV with the AMG Line, which gives it AMG exterior styling, unique AMG wheels, a sports steering wheel in Nappa leather, AMG floor mats and sports pedals. You can also opt for the AMG Line Sport Seat Package that gets you more snug seats with integrated headrests, AMG-specific stitching for the door panels and interior, cherry red leather and different graphics for the screen.

If that's not quite enough AMG for you, there's also the AMG Line Plus with Night Package, which adds all the AMG Line features plus 21-inch wheels with a black tint, a black rear spoiler, illuminated black door sills and Manufaktur seatbelts in red.

Mercedes-Benz

I hear you, AMG isn't your thing. Don't worry, there are plenty of other GLC EVs to choose from, like the Executive Line. It packages the illuminated grille with the illuminated panoramic roof and the Superscreen with the 14-inch passenger display, ambient interior lighting and illuminated door sills. You can also go for the Pinnacle Line, which gives you the Executive features plus active ambient lighting, a Burmester sound system and an air purifier.

If you're someone who wants, no needs, the best, go for the Pinnacle Plus Line. That upgrades your lights on the outside, gets you the 39.1-inch Hyperscreen, as well as an even better Burmester sound system, heated and ventilated front seats that'll massage you, and the Winter package.

We can expect to see the GLC400 4Matic hitting showroom floors in late 2026, with the GLC300+ following in early 2027. The price has yet to be announced, but with BMW's iX3 said to start at around $55,000, Mercedes probably wants to be close to that mark.

It's hard to think of a car in the past few decades that has been as important for Mercedes-Benz as the GLC with EQ Technology. Putting aside its silly name, it's a car that carries an enormous weight on its shoulders. Despite America's best efforts, the rest of the world is moving away from gas-powered vehicles and toward EVs.

For luxury brands like Mercedes, the compact crossover is the most important segment, bar none. It's been a rocky road for Mercedes trying to introduce a model in this segment in the U.S., but the GLC EV looks ready to take the world by storm, all while setting the tone for what a Mercedes-Benz is going to look like for years to come.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/2026-mercedes-benz-glc-ev-paves-the-way-for-every-upcoming-mercedes/l-intro-1757119893.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 16:00:57.273926

Still, India’s clean energy appetite is helping its solar manufacturers deal with the external pressures.
Proceeds from selling in the lucrative U.S. market have helped Indian solar manufacturers update their supply chains in recent years so they were less dependent on imported Chinese parts and materials.
India has also been importing solar modules from China.
Konda said it was too early to determine how the U.S. tariffs will affect Indian solar manufacturers, but that the impact won’t be felt for at least another year because solar component orders are placed well in advance.","On the edge of Jaipur, an Indian city known for its colorful bazaars and palaces, a bustling industrial complex is the epicenter of the country’s push to compete with China in making components for solar technology.

India, the world’s most populous nation, is jockeying for market share against the global leader in solar in part by selling to its own citizens, which helps the country with its other goal: meeting growing domestic demand for electricity.

In the government-subsidized zone that provides tax breaks, solar manufacturer ReNew’s sprawling factory makes enough modules to produce four gigawatts of power each year — enough electricity for approximately 2.5 million Indian homes. The two-year-old facility that employs nearly 1,000 people serves as a symbol of the solar industry’s momentum. India’s capacity to build key solar components more than doubled in the fiscal year ending in March.

“When I got this opportunity, I was really happy that I was directly contributing to the clean energy transition,” said Monisha, an engineer at ReNew who goes by one name. She said the work has helped her become independent and assist her family with their finances.

The country still faces a steep climb in its efforts to develop solar manufacturing that could one day rival China, which makes more than 80% of all solar components in the world and supplies key materials to Indian manufacturers.

India’s solar industry must also contend with a tougher sell to its biggest foreign customer, the United States. President Trump’s tariffs of 50% on Indian goods took effect last month, while Trump’s administration and Republican lawmakers have taken other steps to hinder U.S. adoption of solar and other clean energy.

Still, India’s clean energy appetite is helping its solar manufacturers deal with the external pressures. Energy analysts said India’s domestic demand for solar power will likely reduce disruption from tariffs imposed by the U.S., where about a third of the solar panels produced by India were sold in a recent fiscal year. Proceeds from selling in the lucrative U.S. market have helped Indian solar manufacturers update their supply chains in recent years so they were less dependent on imported Chinese parts and materials.

While Indian solar manufacturers can sell at higher prices abroad, ambitious domestic clean energy targets and domestic demand will help them find buyers within India if sales in the U.S. slow, analysts said.

“This is a huge industry that can absorb these modules and cells that are being produced. We are not necessarily as export dependent as other countries are,” said Charith Konda, an energy analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

India’s domestic solar market has already helped Hyderabad-based Vega Solar shift its customer base for off-grid solar modules for RVs, electric fences and other uses to customers in India in the years since the COVID-19 pandemic, said Vinay Keesara, a company director.

“Before the pandemic, 90% of my business was exports and 10% used to be domestic supply, now this has just flipped the other way around,” he said.

Government policies, demand push growth

One of the most carbon-polluting countries, India is making huge efforts to harness the power of the sun and other clean energy sources. The cost of solar power — now half that of new coal-powered plants — and India’s many sunny days are reasons that experts said installed solar power increased 30 times in the last decade.

Before the U.S. tariffs were announced, researchers with IEEFA and Gurugram, India-based JMK Research wrote that India’s demand for solar modules during the next two years could exceed what its manufacturers are selling within the country because so many are being exported. India has also been importing solar modules from China.

Konda said it was too early to determine how the U.S. tariffs will affect Indian solar manufacturers, but that the impact won’t be felt for at least another year because solar component orders are placed well in advance. And uncertainty remains over the fate of all of Trump’s tariffs. Despite a U.S. court ruling against Trump’s tariffs, they remain in place until at least October while his administration files appeals.

India has nearly 170 gigawatts of renewable energy projects in the pipeline — most of which are solar — and are expected to be completed in the next few years. The country also has an ambitious clean energy target of 500 gigawatts by 2030.

Government policies restricting imports of solar components, incentives for solar manufacturers and mandates for solar power producers to purchase material from government-approved sources gave Indian companies the right signals to ramp up solar manufacturing, said Sanjay Verghese, ReNew’s group president for solar manufacturing and solar projects.

“We are in a good phase right now,” he said. “We are highly dependent on policy support, but we expect that momentum to be maintained.”

Indian manufacturing will likely grow

India still depends on imports of raw materials as well as finished solar components from China but is making progress on reducing its reliance. Government data showed India imported $1.3 billion worth of solar cells and modules from China in the first quarter of the year, down by more than one-third from the same period a year earlier. Cells are individual units that convert sunlight into energy, while modules are made up of multiple cells.

Neshwin Rodrigues, an analyst at climate energy think tank Ember, predicted that by 2030, India might be in a position of needing to import only the raw material polysilicon while producing other solar panel ingredients in the country.

According to India’s renewable energy ministry, the country’s solar module manufacturing capacity more than doubled to 74 gigawatts over the fiscal year ending March 2025. Solar cell manufacturing tripled in the same period, from nine gigawatts to 25 gigawatts.

India still needs Chinese raw materials because it lacks infrastructure to mine and process them, but government initiatives to produce critical minerals are slowly addressing the problem, experts said.

Shubhang Parekh of the National Solar Energy Federation of India said the supply chains needed to process the raw materials are still a work in progress, but he’s confident the challenges can be overcome.

“The next few years will be critical in determining how far we can go,” Parekh said.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ee2f5d2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8640x4536+0+612/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc0%2F1b%2Fe4a4c6a64e6797c8a74aff1f0b20%2F1f38257170c14ee9a07738f8a1141ab0.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 16:00:31.074209

Many other Redditors were thrilled to see a new EV owner enjoying their car.","A giddy new electric car owner showed off their vehicle on Reddit, asking other EV owners for helpful tips.

The Redditor shared a photo of their sleek new Volkswagen ID.3 electric model in a cool gray color.

""Been a VW owner for 11 years and I just upgraded to an ID.3 this weekend!"" the photo's caption read. ""I'm absolutely in love with it so far. Anyone got any tips and tricks to save battery or anything I should know?""

The ID.3 is one of Volkswagen's most popular EVs, with a combined electric range between 240 and 369 miles and battery capacity options ranging from 52kWh to 79kWh. The modern design and zippy driving style make it a dream EV for plenty of people, including the OP.

While this EV is fun and stylish, it's also practical. People who switch from a traditional gas-powered vehicle to an EV can enjoy fuel and maintenance savings. EVs don't require as much routine maintenance, as they don't need oil or fluid changes.

A 2020 Consumer Reports study found that EV owners saved about 60% on fuel costs compared to traditional car drivers. Additionally, a 2018 Forbes report cited a study from the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute, which found that fueling an electric car costs approximately $485 per year, while a gas vehicle costs over $1,100.

You can save even more on fueling if you add solar panels to your home, making charging your car substantially cheaper. Use EnergySage's free tools to compare local installation quotes and save as much as $10,000 on new solar panels. If the upfront costs are prohibitive, consider leasing solar panels instead. Palmetto's LightReach program will install solar panels on your home for no money down.

The average passenger vehicle produces over five tons of carbon dioxide each year, according to the EPA — which significantly contributes to air pollution. Driving an EV saves you time and money on maintenance and fueling while helping reduce harmful pollution.

Many other Redditors were thrilled to see a new EV owner enjoying their car.

""I've had the same car for 3 years. Best car I've ever had. Enjoy!"" one person shared.

""No tips! Just a congrats!!"" another Redditor wrote. ""I took mine on a European road trip this summer and it was a breeze. Such a great car!""

Polo GTI, VW’s first ever GTI EV.","VW really pulled out the stops for this year’s IAA Mobility 2025 in Munich, revealing not one but three new electric cars. We’ve already had a look at the ID. Polo (neé ID.2) and ID. Polo GTI, but the third EV is an even bigger deal. It’s the ID. Cross Concept and it previews next year’s production SUV, one with massive sales potential.

Also: VW Revives Polo Name For EV Era And Teases First Ever Electric GTI

The Cross name tells us this subcompact utility is an electric equivalent to the existing T-Cross combustion crossover, though the name is about all they have in common. The ID. Cross is one of a family of upcoming small EVs built around a new front-wheel-drive version of the MEB platform.

Other models in the family include the ID. Polo and ID. Polo GTI, both expected to hit showrooms in 2026, as well as a production version of the ID. Every1 concept shown earlier this year, which could wear the ID. Up name when it launches in 2027.

Design and Dimensions

Though it rides on virtually the same 2,601 mm (102.4 inches) wheelbase as the ID. Polo (the hatch’s WB is 1mm shorter), the 4,161 mm (163.8 inches) long ID. Cross is 108 mm (4.3 inches) longer and most obviously 58 mm (2.3 inches) taller. There’s 490 liters (17.3 cu.ft) of luggage space in the rear, plus a 25-liter (0.9 cu-ft) frunk, something no other ID EV, including the ID. Polo, has offered.

The handsome, but conservatively designed Polo also misses out on some of the Cross’s bolder and more modern design details. These include a front fascia shaped by the interplay of LED lighting elements that VW describes as “friendly,” along with three illuminated rectangles embedded in a black C-pillar, an intentional nod to both the ID. Buzz and the original Bus that inspired it.

Black plastic trims exaggerate the size of the gently flared arches, which are cut high into the bodywork, while the 21-inch wheels are wrapped in special Continental tires that carry the alloy rim’s pattern into the sidewall. It’s a clever visual flourish, though one that’s impractical, hard to see in the real world, and sure to make tire shops roll their eyes.

Relaxing Interior with Some Physical Buttons

Inside, there are clear echoes of the ID2.all concept that previewed the ID. Polo back in 2023 (VW hasn’t released ID. Polo interior pics yet). An 11-inch digital instrument cluster lies beyond a chunky, square-shaped two-spoke steering wheel and a larger, 13-inch tablet touchscreen is mounted on the top of the dashboard’s center.

Thankfully, VW has listened to criticism of its earlier cars, and a bank of hard buttons is located below, meaning you don’t have to go stabbing at virtual buttons to change the cabin temperature. There’s also a small iDrive-style rotary controller on the console.

And if you don’t want to be overwhelmed by digital information, you simply flip your smartphone so it lies face-down on the wireless charging pad. Do that that and the displays switch to ‘calm status,’ only showing essential info.

That’s not the only way the ID. Cross’s designers have tried to create a relaxing environment. Ambient lighting, fabric-covered surfaces and the Vanilla Chai (read: beige) coloring used throughout the concept’s interior are designed to calm passengers by taking cues from Parisian haute couture and high-end furniture.

For fully horizontal relaxation time, the front and rear seats fold completely flat, meaning you could sleep in the back like you would in a classic VW Bus, albeit with a fair bit less wriggle room. To ensure maximum comfort the seat backrests are finished in a material Volkswagen likens to a comfortable yoga mat.

Powertrain and Range

The German automaker has already confirmed the availability of two battery options for the Polo, but is staying tightlipped about the Cross’s battery hardware, other than revealing it can deliver a 261-mile (420 km) WLTP electric range. A single motor mounted in the nose sends 208 hp (211 PS / 155 kW) to the front wheels, slightly less than the 223 hp (226 PS / 166 kW) mustered by the ID. Polo GTI, VW’s first ever GTI EV.

Related: Sales Collapse Forces VW To Slash Production Of Its Model Y Rival

Officially, the ID. Cross is just a concept, but next summer’s production SUV is going to be virtually identical. In fact, VW even makes a point of mentioning that the interior door handles, which you pull upwards, are production ready. And that should worry rival carmakers because we think VW has nailed this EV’s design in a way it totally failed to do with the ID.4 and ID.7.

US sales are yet to be confirmed, but the ID. Cross will cost from around £25k/€28k when it launches late in 2026 against electric crossovers like the Kia EV2, Toyota Urban Cruiser, Ford Puma Gen-E and Volvo EX30.

While domestic coal demand for power generation has stabilized temporarily, export markets remain volatile.
Meanwhile, AI-driven industrial reallocation is altering freight demand patterns.","The U.S. railroad sector is at a crossroads, and CSX Corporation’s recent financial struggles epitomize the broader challenges facing the industry. In the first half of 2025, CSX reported declining operating income and revenue, driven by shrinking coal demand, reduced fuel surcharges, and weaker merchandise volumes [1]. While the company has made strides in improving network efficiency, its performance underscores a systemic dilemma: the collision of legacy energy dependencies with the accelerating forces of AI-driven industrial reallocation and the global energy transition.

The Energy Transition: A Double-Edged Sword

Coal remains a critical revenue stream for CSX, yet its relevance is waning. First-half 2025 results showed coal revenue declines, mirroring broader trends as global markets shift toward renewables. According to the International Energy Agency, coal’s role in electricity generation is projected to shrink as solar and wind capacity expands, particularly in developing economies [2]. While U.S. domestic coal consumption for power generation rose slightly in 2025 due to data center growth and electric vehicle demand [3], export coal volumes face headwinds. China and India’s reduced reliance on imported thermal coal has dampened demand, directly impacting railroads like CSX, which depend on international shipments [4].

The energy transition’s paradox lies in its potential to reduce emissions while straining traditional freight models. Electrification of railroads, for instance, could cut carbon footprints and maintenance costs by 20% [5], but the upfront investment remains prohibitive. For CSX, this means balancing short-term profitability with long-term sustainability—a challenge compounded by the Trump administration’s freeze on Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) clean energy funding [6].

AI-Driven Reallocation: Efficiency Gains vs. Structural Shifts

Artificial intelligence is reshaping the railroad sector, but its benefits are unevenly distributed. CSX has invested heavily in AI since 2016, deploying tools like predictive maintenance systems, trespassing detection, and the AI assistant Chessie to enhance customer engagement [7]. These initiatives have improved on-time performance by 8–12% and reduced derailments [8]. However, such gains are incremental compared to the transformative AI strategies of peers like Union Pacific and BNSF.

Union Pacific, for example, is leveraging AI for locomotive innovation, including hybrid battery-electric engines to cut emissions [9], while BNSF uses AI-powered diagnostics to monitor wheel health and track conditions in real time [10]. These investments not only optimize operations but also position these railroads to capitalize on AI-driven freight demand reallocation. Startups and logistics platforms are using physics-inspired algorithms and agentic AI to reroute shipments dynamically, reducing delivery times by 11.7% and inventory costs by 16.3% [11]. For CSX, the gap between its AI adoption and competitors’ aggressive digital transformation efforts may exacerbate its competitive disadvantages.

Sector-Wide Pressures: Coal’s Decline and Freight Demand Volatility

The U.S. railroad industry’s reliance on coal—accounting for 35% of global rail freight volumes in 2025 [12]—is increasingly unsustainable. While domestic coal demand for power generation has stabilized temporarily, export markets remain volatile. CSX’s struggles reflect this duality: domestic thermal coal consumption rose to 371.7 million short tons in 2025 [13], but export volumes are projected to fall to 104 million short tons [14]. This dichotomy creates a precarious balance for railroads, which must navigate fluctuating demand while investing in cleaner technologies.

Meanwhile, AI-driven industrial reallocation is altering freight demand patterns. Machine learning systems are optimizing supply chains to minimize emissions and costs, with AI negotiation agents enabling real-time freight pricing adjustments [15]. For railroads, this means shifting from volume-based growth to value-added services, a transition that requires significant operational and technological agility—areas where CSX’s recent performance suggests room for improvement.

Conclusion: A Sector in Transition

CSX’s stagnant performance is not an isolated issue but a microcosm of the railroad sector’s broader struggle to adapt to decarbonization and AI-driven industrial shifts. While the company has made strides in AI adoption and infrastructure modernization, its reliance on coal and slower pace of digital transformation leave it vulnerable to sector-wide headwinds. For investors, the key question is whether CSX can accelerate its pivot toward sustainable, AI-optimized operations—or risk falling further behind peers who are redefining the future of freight.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-07 19:02:16.231398

But its true impact extends well beyond incentives: OBBBA is unsettling the entire financial and insurance underpinning of the U.S. clean energy industry.

OBBBA has accelerated deadlines, with projects now required to begin construction by July 4, 2026, or be in service by December 31, 2027, to qualify for credits. It has also removed the 5% cost-based safe harbor starting September 1, 2025, meaning that only physical work counts toward eligibility. That change alone has lenders and insurers spooked, uncertain when or if returns will materialize.

Meanwhile, Trump’s tariffs on essential materials like steel, copper, and solar components have pushed construction costs even higher. “We’re really now seeing the impacts of what the new reality in the U.S. has meant for investor confidence,” says Meredith Annex, Head of Clean Power at BloombergNEF, after reporting that wind and solar investments plunged 36% year-on-year to $36.4 billion in H1 2025, with onshore wind collapsing 80 percent, the Financial Times reported.

At the same time, insurance is becoming a major issue. Underwriters are recalibrating risk models that now include political unpredictability. As Canaan Crouch of Jencap Specialty Insurance Services warns, “Higher insurance premiums add another cost burden to contractors and developers already grappling with reduced subsidies, higher tariffs and volatile demand.” That’s effectively redefining how projects are valued and bankrolled.

Insurers are tightening their terms in ways that directly reshape project economics. Premiums for utility-scale solar and offshore wind have climbed sharply over the past year, with underwriters increasingly carving out exclusions for mechanical failure and weather-related damage, according to Reuters. Industry brokers say some carriers have shortened policy durations from three years to one, forcing developers to renegotiate coverage annually at higher cost. In offshore wind, several European reinsurers have already reduced their U.S. exposure, leaving a smaller pool of carriers willing to underwrite billion-dollar projects and driving up rates for those that remain.

The disruption is being felt by the industry’s biggest players. Denmark’s Ørsted, once a clean-energy trailblazer, has approved a $9.4 billion emergency rights issue after its U.S. offshore wind projects, Sunrise Wind and Revolution Wind, hit policy roadblocks. Construction on Revolution Wind, almost 80% complete, was halted by a federal stop-work order citing national security concerns, prompting Ørsted to sue the Trump administration. Meanwhile, the company is burning millions weekly in holding costs, and S&P Global has already downgraded its credit rating though Equinor, a 10% shareholder, has pledged up to $941 million in support.

Nor is this limited to utility-scale clean energy.

In residential solar, firms like Sunnova and Mosaic have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy amid uncertainty over tax credits and a decline in demand. Canary Media reported that Sunnova laid off over half its workforce (over 700 employees) before filing, citing untenable debt and market retrenchment. Mosaic, a major residential solar loan provider, also went bankrupt, pointing to macroeconomic headwinds and policy unpredictability.

These are not small casualties. Analysts predict a 50-60% reduction in residential solar demand, risking over 250,000 jobs. As Ara Agopian, CEO of Solar Insure, put it, “There’s going to be a 50 to 60 percent downturn in demand. Many of them will shut their doors as they can’t stay in business without the tax credit.” The Financial Times noted that Guggenheim’s Joe Osha underscored the long-standing difficulties.

In Sunnova’s case, a July 31, 2025 court approval allowed the sale of substantially all assets to a creditor group highlighting how even bankruptcy is being managed to mitigate fallout for homeowners.

States are also feeling the heat, with Texas, once a renewable stronghold, seeing developers cancel or delay nearly $8 billion in projects, while BloombergNEF has tallied over $22 billion in clean energy development shelved nationally, costing more than 16,000 jobs.

Beyond wind and solar, OBBBA’s implications also extend to battery and hydrogen sectors. The law phases out credits for battery manufacturing and accelerates deadlines for hydrogen projects under Section 45V. Experts at the International Council on Clean Transportation estimate U.S. battery production could fall 75 percent short of expectations by 2030, cutting into the clean energy value chain.

Banks that once offered competitive terms on project loans are now widening spreads to reflect heightened policy risk, while credit rating agencies have flagged uncertainty over future cash flows as a trigger for downgrades. Institutional investors that fueled the tax-equity boom of the past decade are becoming more selective, in some cases pausing commitments entirely until the regulatory landscape stabilizes. The result is a much smaller pipeline of available capital and steeper financing costs for developers.

What’s emerging is a clarity that OBBBA’s biggest impact may be the erosion of the industry’s financial ecosystem. Insurance premiums are climbing. Lenders are retreating or demanding new risk-adjusted returns. Developers are cannibalizing capital just to stay afloat.

Conclusion Regulatory risks in the energy sector are no longer confined to compliance failures; they encompass legislative volatility, geopolitical tensions, and the rapid evolution of sustainability mandates.","The energy sector in 2025 remains a high-stakes arena for investors, where regulatory shifts and compliance failures can swiftly disrupt market dynamics. Recent legislative actions, such as the U.S. House of Representatives’ reconciliation bill amending the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), have accelerated the phase-out of critical clean energy tax credits, while cease trade orders against firms like Altima Energy Inc. and Li-Cycle Holdings Corp. underscore the fragility of regulatory compliance in this sector [1]. For investors, the imperative is clear: preparedness and strategic agility are no longer optional but essential to safeguarding returns.

The Escalating Threat of Cease Trade Orders

Cease trade orders (CTOs) have become a recurring risk for energy firms, particularly those in renewable and emerging technologies. In August 2025, Eguana Technologies Inc. saw its management cease trade order lifted by the Alberta Securities Commission after fulfilling filing requirements, but similar fates have befallen companies like A.I.S. Resources Limited, which voluntarily accepted a CTO due to insufficient funds for audit fees [3]. These cases highlight a broader trend: regulatory bodies are tightening scrutiny of financial transparency, especially for firms operating in capital-intensive, high-growth sectors like green hydrogen and battery recycling.

For investors, the implications are twofold. First, CTOs often trigger liquidity crises, as seen when Altima Energy’s failure to file financial reports led to a trading halt on the TSX Venture Exchange [1]. Second, they signal systemic risks—companies unable to meet disclosure standards may lack the governance structures to navigate evolving regulatory landscapes.

Legislative and Policy Volatility: A Double-Edged Sword

The U.S. House reconciliation bill exemplifies how policy shifts can reconfigure market fundamentals overnight. By accelerating the expiration of clean energy tax credits, the legislation has compressed project timelines for developers, creating a “race against the clock” to secure financing and construction permits [1]. Similarly, the EPA’s Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) updates for 2023–2025 have introduced compliance complexities for biofuel producers, requiring firms to balance environmental mandates with operational costs [3].

Investors must also contend with geopolitical regulatory risks. Turkey’s investigation of 66 power firms for grid non-compliance and the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security’s closure of a semiconductor export loophole illustrate how cross-border regulatory actions can disrupt supply chains and investor confidence [2].

Strategic Preparedness: Mitigating Risks Through Proactive Measures

To navigate these challenges, investors are adopting a multi-pronged approach:

Enhanced Due Diligence on Regulatory Filings

Monitoring regulatory filings and company announcements is now a cornerstone of risk management. For instance, Li-Cycle’s CTO was directly linked to its failure to submit periodic disclosures, a red flag for investors who might otherwise overlook operational delays [3]. Tools like real-time compliance tracking platforms and third-party due diligence services are increasingly being deployed to flag early warning signs.

Diversification Across Regulatory Environments

Diversifying geographically and sectorially helps hedge against localized regulatory shocks. For example, offshore wind developers like Ørsted and Equinor, who faced setbacks under the Trump administration’s 2025 policy overhaul, are redirecting investments to Europe and Asia-Pacific markets with more stable regulatory frameworks [2]. Similarly, utilities in wildfire-prone regions are prioritizing grid hardening and real-time monitoring to align with state-level liability mandates, reducing litigation risks [1].

Leveraging Policy Tools for Risk Mitigation

Political risk insurance (PRI) and revised force majeure clauses in contracts are becoming standard for energy projects. These instruments protect against sudden policy changes, such as the abrupt suspension of U.S. offshore wind leasing in 2025, which left developers with stranded assets [2]. Additionally, governments are incentivizing compliance through green subsidies and tax rebates, as seen in the EU’s Net-Zero Industry Act and China’s offshore wind expansion [2].

The Long-Term Outlook: Balancing Stability and Innovation

While regulatory uncertainty persists, the energy transition’s momentum remains robust. Global decarbonization trends, including advancements in offshore wind and green hydrogen, suggest that long-term investments in renewables will outpace short-term volatility. However, investors must balance near-term stability—such as returns from traditional energy assets—with strategic bets on technologies that demonstrate cost competitiveness and scalable deployment pipelines [2].

Conclusion

Regulatory risks in the energy sector are no longer confined to compliance failures; they encompass legislative volatility, geopolitical tensions, and the rapid evolution of sustainability mandates. For investors, the path forward lies in proactive monitoring, diversified portfolios, and strategic alignment with policy frameworks. As the sector navigates these crosscurrents, those who prioritize preparedness will be best positioned to capitalize on the opportunities ahead.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-07 17:01:56.812665

Yet, at community colleges nationwide, environmental stewardship is not just an add-on, but a fundamental thread woven into the fabric of the institution.

A sustainability master plan serves as the blueprint for this work, shaping a college’s daily functions and educational offerings. From geothermal systems heating classrooms to hands-on training for green jobs, these academic eco-advocates are dedicated to softening their environmental impact and operating costs.

This article comes from the current issue of the Community College Journal, published by the American Association of Community Colleges.

With a clear sustainability plan in place, it’s easier to track results and maintain momentum, regardless of staff turnover or competing priorities, says Michael Boyd, president of Kankakee Community College (KCC) in Illinois.

“Sustainability and renewable energy are integrated into curriculum development, budgeting and evaluation of faculty and staff,” says Boyd. “It’s been a focus throughout the history of KCC, and part of our culture.”

In its DNA

KCC is a founding member of the Illinois Green Economy Network, formed in 2008 to drive sustainable workforce growth and a clean energy economy in state. Financed by a $2.5 million grant from the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, the network allocates funds for curriculum development along with a handful of renewable energy projects and initiatives.

A partnership with the Illinois Community College Board, for example, supports the state’s growing electric vehicle industry through job training and technology development programs, Boyd says.

Sustainability is a core facet of life at KCC, a vision that began in the 2000s under the leadership of late president, Jerry Weber. Successor John Avendano continued this work, strengthening an eco-forward mindset further cultivated by retired electrical engineering professor Tim Wilhelm.

KCC’s environmental work is structured around three pillars: building features, on-campus sustainability and certificate completion. The college’s North Extension Center, the county’s first LEED Gold-certified building, boasts energy-efficient lighting and a white synthetic rubber roof that significantly reduces heat absorption.

KCC also offers renewable energy certificates in solar-photovoltaic, solar-thermal and wind technologies, while an associate degree in electrical engineering is designed with a career-minded sustainability focus.

Boyd embraces this mission, believing that responsibility for the planet transcends any single department at KCC. A whole-college commitment is needed to push the work ahead even beyond his tenure, he says.

“We see renewable energy and sustainability as something that’s bigger than ourselves,” Boyd says. “At other colleges, you may have a divide between operations and academic affairs. But at KCC, we have an alliance that inspires our business processes. Even little things, like everyone shutting off their lights for a couple hours, or shutting off their computers, can make a difference. It’s a great value for us, because part of our mission is to be good with our fiscal resources. We have to live that vision for ourselves.”

‘A moral imperative’

In California, Chaffey College’s 35-page sustainability master plan outlines a “triple bottom line” of social, economic and environmental responsibility led by the Green Earth Movement (GEM) committee. Comprised of staff and faculty, this environmental think tank provides campus-wide education while encouraging green practices among students and stakeholders.

“In the broadest sense, we adopted a policy of stewardship, in terms of being efficient with our resources,” says Sam Gaddie, sustainability and environmental safety officer at Chaffey. “GEM is a way to bring this information forward to administrators and communicate this work with students and the community.”

Such transparency is vital, as limited budgets sometimes push green projects aside for larger initiatives. A central aim of the GEM taskforce is to maintain the visibility of all its sustainable initiatives, Gaddie says.

“We’ve got a million competing interests (at Chaffey), and know that certain decisions have to be made,” he says. “We try and make our case that these sustainable options will save money in the long run.”

Successful projects

Despite some frustrations around resource allocation, Chaffey has much to celebrate regarding its environmental practices, Gaddie says. Per terms established by the master plan, any new construction at the college is built to state-mandated green building standards. In addition, Chaffey utilizes native plants and drought-tolerant landscaping on all three campuses.

A large-scale solar carport project spanning Chaffey’s campuses has offset over half the college’s electricity consumption. In recognition of this achievement, the college was one of a dozen two-year colleges to receive a California Community Colleges Board of Governors Energy and Sustainability Award in 2020.

Far from working in silos, the GEM committee collaborates with regional utilities and companies for Earth Day celebrations, with aims of raising awareness on critical issues. Chaffey even partners with a local shepherd on weed management, using goats to graze instead of relying on chemicals or gas-guzzling machinery.

Such partnerships are standard for a college dedicated to environmental literacy, Gaddie says.

“As an institution of higher learning, we took this on as a moral imperative,” he says. “It helps us think about the decisions we’re making, and to set the tone with the community.”

Developing an eco-mindset

Community colleges are incorporating sustainability into curriculum, extending beyond simple environmental courses to include adjacent fields. At Chaffey, statistics students analyze bell curves using an online dashboard that displays the school’s solar energy output. Enrollees in the college’s STEM pathway study heat exchangers that power an on-campus thermal energy storage tank.

“Students are analyzing data to use it for in-class projects,” says Gaddie. “They’re learning a topic and getting to see its real-world applications.”

Bronx Community College’s (BCC) eco-conscious approach stretches back 20 years, when an automotive program began incorporating electric vehicles and alternative fuels into classroom training. In 2023, BCC received a $1 million grant, funded by the New York Power Authority, to improve campus sustainability and reduce the college’s environmental impact. The award also funded a green workforce training program, providing solar and wind turbine instruction to residents and students from across the City University of New York system.

In addition, learners designed logos for campus recycling bins, an exciting opportunity to apply chosen career skills to real-world challenges, notes Elena Perez, project director of BCC’s Green Action Challenge team, which oversees the college’s sustainability efforts.

“The public can see the designs created by students,” says Perez. “It’s wonderful way to convey our message effectively.”

In May, BCC selected three students to promote campus environmental initiatives. These “green ambassadors” will partner with college groups to raise awareness on climate resilience efforts, ranging from composting bins to a joint rain garden project.

Nor is BCC’s student-centric environmental stance limited to campus, or even the borders of the United States. Last year, the college sent students to India as part of the CUNY-India Pollution Study — a three-year research program funded by the National Science Foundation focused on mapping air pollution in underserved communities.

Every aspect of this work is purposeful and seamlessly linked with the school’s broader environmental goals, says Richard Ginsberg, assistant vice president of communications and marketing. Rallying behind sustainability means living it daily. Ginsberg was pleased to find composting bins at the college’s Run the Bronx footrace, allowing participants to dispose of fruit peels after orange and banana giveaways.

“We also switched from plastic water bottles to boxed (for the race),” says Ginsberg. “It’s just a mindset on the way we do things on campus every day. The little things add up, and that mindset stays in place despite staff turnover and changing priorities.”",https://www.ccdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Guth_Chaffey-Solar-Parking-cred-Chaffey-002.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 18:00:36.058887

Not much changed immediately for electric vehicle drivers across Canada after the federal government announced a step back from its EV policy. But many drivers fear infrastructural growth and improved public charging stations will slow in the coming years.

When Julien Kos drove to Moncton earlier this year, his plan heavily relied on charging his vehicle at a mall while getting a quick bite.

“I got there with 15 per cent and I expected to be able to just charge at the mall,” said Kos, who lives in a remote town of Back Bay, N.B., about 130 kilometres south of Fredericton. But he found several public chargers were broken.

Kos said many provincial public chargers are “unreliable,” while others chargers owned by Tesla are older and compatible with only Tesla vehicles. With the pause in the EV mandate, he feels fewer automakers would be inclined to keep investing in EVs, resulting in a slowdown in overall infrastructure growth.

“It’s definitely disappointing to see that there’s not enough infrastructure in our province, specifically,” said Kos, who bought his first Tesla EV in January. The policy shift hasn’t changed his plans to keep driving his car.

Prime Minister Mark Carney announced Friday that the federal government will not implement a mandate requiring that 20 per cent of all new vehicles sold in Canada by next year be electric, while promising a 60-day review of the country’s electric-vehicle program.

The mandate was initially designed to increase until 2035, by which point all new light-duty vehicles sold in Canada were to be fully electric or plug-in hybrids.

Carney said the review is aimed at finding “future flexibilities and ways to reduce costs” while government documents suggest amendments to the annual sales targets, including the 2035 goal, will be considered.

The pause likely won’t affect EV adoptions nor those who already have one, said Tracy Miersch, EV ambassador team leader for MEET Moncton, who bought her first EV four years ago.

“Where I think it might impact is the car manufacturers that haven’t really bought into the EV idea,” she said in an interview. “They might slow their development.”

MEET, or Mobile EV Education Trailer, is a program run by Plug’n Drive Canada, an organization that focuses on EV education.

Miersch said there’s a concern that government grants for improved public charging stations could be affected, but private companies could help with that gap in the existing infrastructure.

“There are enough private companies and businesses that are now seeing the advantage of having an EV charger at or near their location,” she said.

Coffee chain Tim Hortons announced last month its plans to set up EV fast chargers at 100 locations across the country by the end of 2028. The company has partnered with the charging company FLO.

“I’m not worried about the infrastructure growing,” said Angie Thomas, secretary of the board of the Electric Vehicle Association of Alberta. “But I do worry about future charging projects coming.”

Thomas said the move could hurt Canada’s chance of getting ahead of the electric curve.

“Technology is moving ahead very quickly, but we need to embrace this technology or we risk being left behind,” Thomas said.

For Alroy Brouwer, the federal government’s decision to pause the mandate doesn’t affect his decision to trade in his second vehicle for an EV when the car is at the end of its life.

“Once people start driving an EV, they’re not going back to a gas-powered car again,” said the Barrie, Ont., resident, who bought his first EV three years ago.

“You quickly realize how stupid it is to burn $20 in gas every day to get somewhere.”

But his decision heavily relies on the comfort of home-charging infrastructure.

“If you can’t charge it at home, then right now, with our infrastructure, it’s not as easy as switching over,” Brouwer said.

He said many public charging stations on southern Ontario highways tend to be unreliable and are often out of service, or can be fairly expensive to top up the car.

The mandate pause comes at a time when EVs are seeing a dip in uptake. An AutoTrader survey from April showed 42 per cent of respondents say they’re considering an EV as their next vehicle, down from 46 per cent last year. In 2022, 68 per cent said they would consider buying an EV.

EV adoption isn’t going to be linear, Kristian Aquilina, president of GM Canada, said at a conference in Vancouver on Saturday. He added the policies around EVs need to be more reflective of consumer demand, rather than a forced outcome from federal mandates.

“We would be pursuing a future whereby EV policy in this country is just a bit more reflective of the realities of consumer demand, rather than a forced outcome,” he said.

$1.7 million for Foothill Transit’s zero emissions bus program, split evenly between the 28th and 38th districts

$1.2 million for 36th district-based Culver City’s hydrogen bus pilot project

$1 million for zero emission battery electric buses for the El Sol Shuttle

$1 million for battery electric buses and the installation of charging infrastructure for Omnitrans Public Transit Agency

$850,000 for 37th district-based Culver City’s hydrogen bus project

$850,000 for zero emission battery electric buses the Link Willowbrook and King Medical Center Shuttle transit services

$260,000 for Sacramento Food Bank & Family Services to replace three gas-powered buses with electric buses, plus an EV refrigerated cargo van

$250,000 for electric buses and charging infrastructure for the city of South Gate

$250,000 for additional electric buses for the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)

Ohio, Massachusetts, and Washington would also receive funds. In Ohio, Toledo Area Regional Transit Authority would collect $2.45 million to transition to zero emissions buses, plus build a new garage.

Steamship Authority Shuttle in Massachusetts would receive $2 million to replace its gas-powered buses with electric, while Community Transit in Washington would get $2 million to purchase battery electric buses.

The U.S. power grid isn’t collapsing—but it is under pressure like never before.","America’s power grid is straining under the weight of a fast-changing energy landscape. Beyond the usual summer hum of air conditioners, power demand is surging from electric vehicle chargers and sprawling new data centers. At the same time, the infrastructure built to deliver reliable electricity is aging and showing its limits. From Texas heatwaves to California blackouts, the warning signs are impossible to ignore.

This isn’t a technical challenge—it’s an economic and political reckoning. If the grid fails, it won’t be because we lacked solutions. It will be because we didn’t act quickly enough.

A Demand Surge Few Anticipated

For nearly two decades, U.S. electricity demand was flat. Now, consumption is climbing, driven by technologies that arrived faster than planners expected.

Artificial intelligence has unleashed a wave of data center construction. These facilities, dense with high-performance servers and cooling systems, are among the most power-hungry assets in the country. In 2023, AI data centers consumed about 4.4% of U.S. electricity, and that share could triple by 2028, according to Penn State’s Institute of Energy and the Environment.

Northern Virginia—“Data Center Alley”—now handles 70% of global internet traffic, pushing utilities like Dominion Energy to scramble for capacity. Meanwhile, Microsoft and Google warn that a shortage of skilled electricians could delay expansion, with estimates that the U.S. will need 500,000 more electricians in the next decade.

Electric vehicles, heat pumps, and electrified industry are adding further strain. The Pacific Northwest Utilities Conference Committee projects growth equivalent to seven Seattle-sized cities within ten years. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects U.S. electricity sales to rise from 4,097 billion kWh in 2024 to 4,193 billion kWh in 2025, with similar gains to follow.

And finally, there’s climate. As extreme heat events multiply, cooling demand in places like Texas and Arizona is surging—driving peak loads to new records.

The Supply Gap: Retirements Outpace Replacement

Just as demand is accelerating, the U.S. is retiring some of its most dependable sources of power.

The EIA projects 12.3 gigawatts (GW) of capacity will retire in 2025, a 65% jump over 2024. That includes 8.1 GW of coal, such as the 1,800-MW Intermountain Power Project in Utah, plus another 2.6 GW of natural gas. These plants provide round-the-clock power that intermittent sources cannot yet replace.

Wind and solar capacity continue to grow, but not fast enough. The Department of Energy’s July 2025 Resource Adequacy Report warns that only 22 GW of firm generation is expected by 2030—well short of the 104 GW needed for peak demand. Transmission bottlenecks, permitting delays, and slow adoption of long-duration storage compound the problem.

Grid operators from PJM, MISO, ERCOT, and others told Congress bluntly in March 2025: “Demand is accelerating, supply is lagging, and current tools may not be enough to bridge the gap.”

Growing Vulnerabilities: Weather, Cyber, and Sabotage

Beyond the supply-demand imbalance, the grid faces mounting risks.

Heatwaves, wildfires, and storms are stressing transmission systems nationwide. Events once considered rare—like the 2003 Northeast blackout that hit 50 million people—are now seen as precursors of larger disruptions.

As smart grids and distributed resources proliferate, so do digital entry points for hackers. In 2024, DOE funded 16 cybersecurity projects, including Georgia Tech’s AI-based “DerGuard” system to monitor risks in distributed energy.

Sabotage at substations and transmission lines is also rising. With more than 160,000 miles of high-voltage lines and 7,300 plants, much of it decades old, the system is a sprawling, exposed target. Homeland Security now classifies grid protection alongside nuclear and water infrastructure.

Policy Gridlock and Infrastructure Delays

Despite the alarms, policy responses remain sluggish.

Jurisdiction is a big part of the problem. Regional transmission operators manage the grid but don’t own generation or lines. Utilities do, while states control siting and permitting. The result is a patchwork that slows progress.

As of mid-2024, transmission projects across the U.S. faced delays of five to seven years due to permitting hurdles, interconnection bottlenecks, and supply chain constraints. By mid-2025, lead times for large power transformers had stretched beyond 30 months, with some units requiring up to four years for delivery—posing serious risks to grid reliability and expansion.

Even bipartisan efforts like the CIRCUIT Act—introduced in February 2025 to incentivize domestic transformer production through a 10% tax credit—remain stalled in committee, despite widespread industry support and urgent supply chain concerns.

Meanwhile, subsidies continue to favor intermittent renewables over firm capacity. The Inflation Reduction Act accelerated clean energy deployment, but without parallel investment in balancing technologies, reliability risks grow.

What’s Being Done

Federal and private efforts are ramping up, though often as short-term fixes.

DOE has delayed retirements of coal and gas plants and issued reliability directives under the Federal Power Act. These measures keep the lights on but do little to build long-term resilience. DOE also aims to increase long-distance capacity 16% by 2030, adding 7,500 miles of new lines. But permitting delays and local resistance remain obstacles.

In 2025, DOE launched $32 million in pilot projects for smart EV charging, responsive buildings, and distributed energy integration. These solutions could eventually scale, but utilities and regulators must buy in.

Investor Implications: Reliability as a Premium

For investors, grid instability is a risk, but also an opportunity.

Companies like NextEra Energy, Dominion, and Avangrid are investing billions in grid modernization and diversified generation. Avangrid alone plans $20 billion through 2030 across 23 states.

Independent power producers are also benefiting from the shifting landscape. NRG Energy, one of the nation’s largest competitive power suppliers, has seen its shares climb sharply as rising demand boosts wholesale electricity prices. Unlike regulated utilities, NRG and its peers compete in deregulated markets, where higher load growth and tighter capacity directly translate into stronger margins. That dynamic could make competitive generators an overlooked winner in a strained grid environment.

Firms like Fluence, Stem Inc., and Tesla Energy are seeing growing demand for storage and microgrid solutions. Pilot programs backed by DOE may open new markets for software-driven load management.

With coal exiting and renewables constrained, power generated by nuclear energy and natural gas retain a “reliability premium.” Deloitte estimates the U.S. power sector will need $1.4 trillion in new capital between 2025 and 2030, with similar levels required through 2050. Firms able to supply firm generation or grid services stand to benefit.

Conclusion: Crisis or Course Correction?

The U.S. power grid isn’t collapsing—but it is under pressure like never before. Demand growth, baseload retirements, extreme weather, and policy paralysis are colliding to create a fragile system.

Whether this moment becomes a crisis or a correction depends on how quickly policymakers, utilities, and investors adapt. The tools exist—firm generation, smart load management, and modern transmission. But without faster coordination and realistic incentives, the U.S. risks trading energy abundance for energy fragility.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68bdbbb7a1d1e323abe0cf0a/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-09-07 14:01:14.825553

Geopolitical Risks and Strategic Resilience CATL’s global expansion is a double-edged sword.
Conclusion: A Calculated Gambit CATL’s gigafactory expansion is a masterclass in strategic positioning.","The electric vehicle (EV) revolution is reshaping global industrial landscapes, and no company embodies this transformation more than Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Ltd. (CATL). As the world’s largest EV battery supplier, CATL’s aggressive expansion into Europe and Asia is not merely a bet on growth—it’s a calculated move to dominate the next era of mobility. With a 37% global market share in 2023 [1], CATL is leveraging its technological prowess, strategic partnerships, and geopolitical agility to secure a commanding position in the EV supply chain. This analysis evaluates the investment potential of CATL’s European and Asian manufacturing footprint, weighing the interplay of demand, policy tailwinds, and competitive dynamics.

Europe: A High-Stakes Bet on Localization

CATL’s European expansion is anchored by its €7.34 billion Debrecen, Hungary, gigafactory, which will produce 100 GWh annually by 2025 [2]. This facility, part of a broader €13.2 billion European investment, underscores CATL’s commitment to localizing production for key clients like Stellantis, BMW, and Daimler. The Hungarian plant’s focus on lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) batteries—a cost-effective alternative to nickel-based cells—positions it to capitalize on Europe’s growing demand for affordable EVs. According to the European Commission, the continent’s battery cell production capacity could reach 886 GWh by 2030 [3], aligning with CATL’s ambitions to meet surging demand while circumventing EU concerns over Chinese overcapacity.

However, CATL’s European strategy is not without risks. The EU’s fragmented regulatory environment and scrutiny of foreign investment pose challenges. For instance, CATL’s joint venture with Stellantis in Spain has drawn criticism for lacking technology transfer agreements, potentially leaving Europe reliant on Chinese expertise [4]. Additionally, the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and EU Green Deal Industrial Plan (GDIP) are reshaping subsidy landscapes, favoring domestic producers. CATL’s “License Royalty Service” model—outsourcing production to local partners while retaining IP—may mitigate these risks but could dilute long-term control [5].

Asia: Leveraging China’s EV Supercycle

In Asia, CATL’s dominance is underpinned by China’s EV boom, where the company supplies batteries to Tesla, Toyota, and BYD. China’s aggressive electrification policies, including tax breaks and NEV quotas, have driven EV adoption to 35% of total car sales in 2024 [6]. CATL’s innovations—such as sodium-ion batteries and high-nickel cylindrical cells—are critical to maintaining cost advantages as global pack prices fall below $50/kWh [7].

Yet, CATL faces intensifying competition from domestic rivals like BYD, whose blade battery technology is gaining traction. Internationally, LG Energy Solution and Northvolt are expanding in Europe, with LG’s Italian plant targeting 120 GWh by 2030 [8]. CATL’s LFP strategy offers a distinct edge: LFP batteries, which are 30% cheaper than NMC variants, are becoming the preferred choice for mainstream EVs [9]. This cost advantage is amplified by CATL’s vertical integration, including a planned cathode materials plant in Morocco to secure phosphate supplies for its European operations [10].

Financials and ROI: A Long-Term Play

CATL’s Q1 2025 results highlight its financial resilience: net profit surged 32.9% year-over-year to ¥14 billion ($2 billion), driven by cost reductions and a shift to high-margin technologies like sodium-ion batteries [11]. While specific break-even timelines for European gigafactories remain undisclosed, industry benchmarks suggest a 10–15-year horizon due to high capital expenditures [12]. The EU’s battery recycling market, projected to grow at 32.05% CAGR through 2030, could further enhance ROI by monetizing CATL’s LFP recycling expertise [13].

Geopolitical Risks and Strategic Resilience

CATL’s global expansion is a double-edged sword. In Europe, environmental compliance and supply chain dependencies—such as reliance on Chinese-sourced materials—pose operational risks. For example, CATL’s U.S. BESS unit was disconnected over security concerns, illustrating the fragility of cross-border partnerships [14]. Meanwhile, the EU’s push for “strategic autonomy” could impose stricter foreign investment rules, complicating CATL’s growth trajectory.

Conclusion: A Calculated Gambit

CATL’s gigafactory expansion is a masterclass in strategic positioning. By aligning with Europe’s decarbonization goals while leveraging China’s manufacturing scale, the company is hedging against regional uncertainties. However, its success hinges on navigating geopolitical tensions and outpacing rivals in innovation. For investors, CATL represents a high-conviction opportunity in the EV supply chain, albeit one requiring patience and a nuanced understanding of global policy dynamics.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-07 19:01:20.435843

But the new virtual power plant that the Calders are a part of can also generate and deploy electricity, like a traditional power plant.
So far, the Blatchford virtual power plant includes only about 20 townhomes completed by Landmark Homes.
Billed as Europe's largest virtual power plant, it shows the potential huge scale of such networks.
""The big thing for me is we produce power, we use our own power, we save our power and we give back power,"" she said.","When there's a local power outage, it doesn't affect Rebecca Calder's house in Edmonton's new Blatchford neighbourhood.

The Wi-Fi network, the fridge and the heat pump that heats and cools the townhouse all keep humming along, thanks to a backup battery in her basement.

""It's great,"" she said — and not just for power outages.

The battery charges from solar panels on the roof of the three-bedroom home she shares with her husband, Daniel, and five-year-old daughter, Ida. That allows the family to use stored solar power to run the dishwasher and laundry, even after the sun goes down, and to earn a credit of up to $60 per month on their electricity bill in the summer.

The solar panels and battery provide benefits not just for the Calders but for the entire electrical grid. They're designed to join forces with the solar panels and batteries of 99 other homes as part of a virtual power plant (VPP) that supplies power to the grid, similar to what a physical power plant does.

""It feels good when you can see your power going to the grid. It feels good when you see that first credit on the bill,"" said Calder, whose family moved into the net-zero home in January.

Proponents of virtual power plants say they make it possible to add more wind and solar to the grid by filling the gaps when it's not windy or sunny.

VPPs can also help stabilize the grid by matching electricity supply with demand and reduce or defer the need to spend money on building physical power plants and other electricity infrastructure, saving money for both utilities and other ratepayers.

What are virtual power plants?

Virtual power plants are networks of devices that generate, use and store energy, such as smart thermostats, electric vehicle batteries and solar panels with battery storage. By connecting and controlling them together, the energy saved, stored or released by the network eventually adds up to the scale of a physical power plant.

So far, most VPPs in Canada have been limited to networks of smart thermostats that utilities can temporarily adjust to reduce electricity demand and relieve strain on the grid.

But the new virtual power plant that the Calders are a part of can also generate and deploy electricity, like a traditional power plant.

How do they work?

In summer, solar panels on the homes of the Calders and their neighbours generate more energy than they use.

Extra solar is stored in the battery in their basement, supplied by the German company Sonnen, which also makes the software for the project. The battery is controlled by local utilities EPCOR and Solartility, two other partners in the project.

Geoff Ferrell, senior vice-president of virtual power plants at Sonnen, said either utility can draw from the batteries of the VPP if they need to stabilize the local grid or when the price of electricity is high, making it advantageous for the utility to sell to the wholesale market.

The homeowner can monitor what's happening but can't control it.

Calder said sometimes when she's bored, she'll check the mobile app that tells her how much power is being produced, stored and returned to the grid. She likes the simplicity for homeowners.

""We don't need to think about it,"" she said.

Calder said she feels her family is doing their part to solve the climate crisis by generating renewable energy. ""It's such a small thing to do, but it's helping.""

On a typical day, she said, the software stops the battery from being drained below 30 per cent, so her family will always have backup power in case of an outage.

Benefits for the grid

Brent Harris is vice-chair of Decentralised Energy Canada, an industry group dedicated to the development of distributed energy technology, such as district heating, microgrids and virtual power plants. Aside from providing benefits for individual customers, he said, VPPs can help solve another big problem: the skyrocketing demand for electricity.

""People are adopting electric vehicles. People are switching from gas to electricity and heat pumps,"" Harris said, ""at the same time as you're seeing all these data centres coming on.""

Reports from the International Energy Agency and the Canadian Climate Institute found Canada would need to double or triple its electrical grid capacity by 2050 to reach its net-zero emissions goal.

That would require costly upgrades to the entire grid, from transformers to substations to distribution lines.

WATCH | How to go green and build a net-zero dream home:

Harris said generating power close to where it's consumed is another option.

""We need to get more out of the grid that we already have,"" he said. ""If we can put these smart assets out there, actually we don't need to upgrade those lines for decades into the future.""

Harris is also the founder and chief operating officer of Calgary-based Eguana Technologies Inc., a home battery storage provider that is building a one megawatt virtual power plant with B.C. Hydro. The utility is offering batteries for free to 200 homes where the local grid would otherwise need capacity upgrades to ensure reliability.

As with the Blatchford project, the homeowner will get backup power from the batteries, but the utility will control them. B.C. Hydro can charge the batteries when demand is low. During peak times, it can disconnect them from the grid and get the homeowners to rely on the battery, reducing demand on the local grid.

Room to grow?

So far, the Blatchford virtual power plant includes only about 20 townhomes completed by Landmark Homes. But by the end of 2026, the development is expected to have 100 homes whose solar panels and batteries will be able to store up to two megawatt hours of power and deploy nearly half a megawatt as needed.

Ferrell, the VP at Sonnen, said his company's first Canadian project is just a demonstration, but he hopes it will pave the way for bigger ones.

In the United States, one of Sonnen's partners, Rocky Mountain Power, now has a growing VPP of 8,000 batteries that store up to 114 MWh and can supply 39 MW daily to the grid — similar in scale to Capital Power's 130-hectare solar farm, with 110,000 solar panels, in Strathmore, Alta.

That's still tiny compared with a 12 GW plant run by Oslo-based Statkraft that comprises more than 1,400 wind and solar installations in Germany. Billed as Europe's largest virtual power plant, it shows the potential huge scale of such networks.

WATCH | Taking on power outages with a giant battery in your home:

Kelly Tallas, co-founder and CEO of Calgary-based Solartility Group, said some countries in Europe have really implemented this kind of technology well.

So far in Canada, a hurdle to larger-scale projects is varying regulations among provinces, and most are designed to allow large generators to sell to the grid — not small, distributed energy sources. But Tallas said Alberta has started to allow ""micro"" generators, such as individual homes, to sell power to the grid through aggregators like Solartility. Harris, of Eguana Technologies, said there's also interest in this technology in British Columbia, Ontario and Nova Scotia.

Meanwhile, Calder said she's really happy with her system and would ""definitely recommend"" something similar to other families.

""The big thing for me is we produce power, we use our own power, we save our power and we give back power,"" she said.

So what's missing?,admin,,,,,https://capitalethiopia.com/2025/09/07/young-africans-need-jobs-the-green-economy-needs-workers-so-whats-missing/,"Across the continent, green skills programmes are preparing graduates for formal careers in sectors like green hydrogen or utility-scale renewables.
The result is a green economy that looks viable on paper, but remains disconnected from the realities of Africa’s labour markets.
And the ILO estimates that the green economy could create at least 3.3 million jobs across the continent by 2030.
Incentives for small-scale solar, vital for clean energy access and SME job creation, are missing, but the groundwork for a more inclusive green economy is being laid.
In Kenya, where the informal sector drives over 80% of employment, most green skills programmes still target the formal economy.","Climate High-Level Champion for COP29, Nigar Apadarai, calls for urgent alignment between youth skills, SME growth and climate ambition.

Across Africa, small businesses are already delivering climate solutions. They power homes, grow food, repair machinery, and manage waste. These are the kinds of enterprises that keep economies running; mostly informal, often climate-smart by necessity, and critical to everyday life. But they remain largely invisible in the ecosystem of climate policies, investment flows, and skills development required to shape the green economy.

At the same time, millions of young people are being trained for jobs that don’t yet exist. Across the continent, green skills programmes are preparing graduates for formal careers in sectors like green hydrogen or utility-scale renewables. These industries are vital to long-term climate goals, but in many countries, they are not yet creating employment at scale. Meanwhile, the businesses already hiring in climate-relevant sectors lack the support to grow.

The old saying that it is better to teach people to fish than to give them a fish has new relevance: the skills we teach will determine whether young people can seize the opportunities of a changing economy. The good news is that new delivery models — powered by the internet — mean skills can be rolled out faster and more affordably.

This week, as governments, investors and campaigners gather in Addis Ababa for the Africa Climate Summit, that disconnect is in sharp focus. The transition cannot succeed unless it creates jobs and livelihoods.

Each year, up to 12 million young Africans enter the workforce, yet only 3 million formal jobs are created, according to the Africa Development Bank. At the same time, more than 72 million young people are not in education, employment or training, the ILO reports, while many others are stuck in training pathways that don’t match employer demand. The result is a green economy that looks viable on paper, but remains disconnected from the realities of Africa’s labour markets.

The potential is there. SMEs already generate up to 80% of employment in many African economies, according to the International Finance Corporation. And the ILO estimates that the green economy could create at least 3.3 million jobs across the continent by 2030. But that will only happen if market conditions improve and, crucially, if the systems that shape climate delivery, enterprise growth, and skills development are aligned.

Right now, they are not. Climate and economic planning remain siloed; policy frameworks often prioritie large-scale industries and multilateral investment; skills systems are designed without meaningful employer input; and access to finance remains limited, particularly for small businesses operating in informal or decentralised sectors.

Positively, in July, Liberia launched Africa’s first Youth Entrepreneurship Investment Bank, supported by the African Development Bank, to tackle youth unemployment. It aims to finance 30,000 youth-led businesses, create 120,000 jobs, and unlock $500m in lending – with nearly half expected in the green economy.

In South Africa, the Just Transition Pathways study maps what a net zero economy needs – including 6-12 gigawatts of new renewables each year. That evidence base helped shape the Just Energy Transition Skills for Employment programme, which links training with real market demand and supports SME participation in sectors like solar and green hydrogen. Incentives for small-scale solar, vital for clean energy access and SME job creation, are missing, but the groundwork for a more inclusive green economy is being laid.

Elsewhere, momentum is building but is uneven. In Kenya, where the informal sector drives over 80% of employment, most green skills programmes still target the formal economy. In Ghana and Nigeria, renewable energy SMEs face financing barriers even as demand grows. Modular, work-integrated training, which allows young people to earn while they learn, is gaining traction as a way to scale both skills and opportunities, but progress must accelerate.

That’s why we need to refocus on delivery. First, by recognising SMEs as central to climate action and job creation. That means integrating them into national climate planning and removing policy barriers.

Second, by tying training to enterprise demand. Modular, job-embedded skills programmes, delivered through technical colleges and community-based providers, can help bridge the gap between training and employment. But they must be designed with employers, not just by administrators.

Third, by broadening the focus of climate finance. While large-scale projects remain essential, decentralised solutions and SME-led delivery offer faster returns in terms of both impact and employment. Investments in platforms, capacity-building, and supportive infrastructure are urgently needed.

This is the approach we are taking through the Climate-Proofing SMEs campaign, launched under my mandate as Climate High-Level Champion for COP29. So far it has engaged more than 45 collaborators and reached nearly 90 million SMEs in more than 100 countries. The campaign focuses on three priorities: helping large businesses strengthen climate-resilient supply chains by supporting SMEs to adopt climate action; mobilising finance from development banks, commercial leaders, and investors for SMEs in emerging economies; and equipping SMEs with practical tools to help them embed climate action into their operations.

Africa’s young people have the talent to lead the green economy. But they cannot do it alone. It’s time to build systems that align skills, finance and policy with the enterprises creating jobs today.

The moment to act is now.",https://capitalethiopia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Labour-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 19:01:50.589542

The Bangalore Electricity Supply Company (Bescom) has unveiled its first public EV battery-swapping station, offering an alternative to traditional charging that could make electric vehicle ownership easier, faster, and more affordable than ever.

The station, first launched at Bescom's KR Circle office, allows EV user to replace their depleted batteries with fully charged ones in just two minutes, according to the Deccan Herald. This pit stop-style station is as fast as grabbing a cup of coffee, unlike traditional charging, which takes a lot of time.

""This battery-swapping centre is a significant milestone in delivering fast, reliable, and accessible EV services to users in Bengaluru,"" said Dr. N. Shivashankar, managing director of Bescom. The project is a collaboration with IndoFast Energy, which already operates more than 250 swapping centres across India.

This innovation is just the beginning. Bescom has also announced plans to set up 20 additional stations across the city in the coming months.

This impressive innovation is not without its concerns. Many who are sceptical of EVs and their positive effects on the environment often point to the significant energy and resources that go into creating an EV battery.

While it's true that manufacturing an EV battery requires considerable energy and raw materials, this is only part of the story. Over the lifetime of the vehicle, EVs powered by clean energy dramatically reduce the release of polluting gases compared to gas-powered cars.

It is unclear at this time exactly how the Bescom battery replacement stages work on a procedural level. However, it seems as though they remove the battery, replace it with a charged one, and charge the removed battery themselves for a future battery swap. This is a great way to extend battery lifespans and enable reuse cycles.

Pairing EV ownership with home solar takes these advantages even further. Charging your vehicle with clean, self-generated solar power can slash fuel costs dramatically while cutting reliance on the grid.

From real estate and electric mobility to corporate transportation and tax advisory services, the impact of these changes is expected to be wide-ranging.

In the real estate sector, the reduction of GST on key construction materials like cement and steel is being viewed as a major boost.

Snehdeep Aggarwal, Founder & Chairman of Bhartiya Group, said, 'The reduction of GST on cement, steel and related construction materials is a timely and much-needed boost for the real estate sector. Lower input costs will allow developers to invest more in superior design, modern amenities, and sustainable practices, while ensuring greater affordability for homebuyers.'

'Corporate real estate too will benefit from improved cost efficiencies, making office and commercial projects more attractive for businesses and investors,' he added.

The reforms also address the corporate transport ecosystem, with a sharp cut in GST on commercial vehicles from 28 per cent to 18 per cent. This is expected to enhance the viability of vehicle ownership for driver-partners and improve the scalability of corporate commute programs.

Sriram Kannan, Founder & CEO of Routematic, said, 'The GST 2.0 reforms will significantly transform the corporate commute ecosystem in which Routematic operates. By reducing GST on commercial vehicles from 28 per cent to 18 per cent, more driver-partners will find it viable to purchase ICE vehicles at lower EMIs, boosting their earnings and livelihood security.'

In the electric vehicle (EV) space, keeping all EVs--across segments--within the 5% GST slab without cess is being viewed as a progressive, market-shaping move.

We’re not living in a natural outcome of human needs and behavior. The built environment as we know it—buildings and the spaces between—does direct damage to our minds. Land use planning has had devastating impacts on Americans: economically, socially, and culturally. But I’m not a doomer and I know these things are fixable. Not overnight reversible, but certainly fixable.

Copycat plans

Typical land use rules are written, updated, and enforced at the local government level. But as you might expect, agencies copied each other over the years because why wouldn’t they. Years ago, when I learned some photography techniques that were new to me, I made cheat sheets for other photographers. Much of what I’ve learned as an adult (podcasting, publishing, public speaking, etc.) has been taught by generous people who themselves had learned tips and tricks. So of course public agencies copied each other with their rule-making. “That worked for a similar river city? Let’s try it here.”

Planning departments at city and county levels weren’t setting out to guide development in a way that would purposefully harm people. Quite the opposite.

If a new Sears distribution center was coming to town, they’d want to map out a plan to accommodate all the new employees and subsequent traffic. In the middle of the 20th century, planners were still very much concerned about separating dirty and/or dangerous land uses from residential areas. The result was that all across the country, local development rules required or incentivized development patterns that spread everyone and everything across the landscape.

A work zone, school zone, shopping zone, entertainment zone, and a sleep zone were established. And then each major category started getting more prescriptive subcategories. “Residential” morphed into single-family, multi-family (apartments), and condos. But wait, there’s more! Residential land uses started to be regulated by local governments according to lot size: garden apartments, planned unit developments, and subdivisions were each given rules. Residential was also regulated by the type of people living in a place: public housing, group dwellings, age-restricted dwelling, renters, and owners.

Local regulations created (and continue to create) sprawl in cities, not just the suburbs.

The traffic factor

Land use planning requires traffic engineering analysis, a process prioritizing speedy car movement above all else. Wider roads and intersections are not just suggested but required with the express goal to move vehicular traffic from zone to zone as quickly as possible. This has been going on for nearly 100 years without taking a foot off the brake.

The obvious outcome of modern land use planning is that Americans drive everywhere all the time. Not just work commutes, but all the errands before, during, and after work. Half of our car trips are less than a few miles long. A quarter are less than one mile. Less than a mile in a car by ourselves.

The mental health connection

Life in a single-occupant vehicle has its perks, like singing along to music or listening to podcasts uninterrupted. It also has its pains, like separation from other humans and mental deterioration.

Loneliness is a significant variable affecting depression. It’s a predisposing factor. Cigna conducted a study of 20,000 Americans, and reported a jaw-dropping finding: nearly half of adults sometimes or always feel alone. 40% said their relationships aren’t meaningful and they feel isolated.

Dr. Julianne Holt-Lunstad is a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Brigham Young University. She says the health risks of missing out on social connection is like smoking 15 cigarettes a day.

Worse yet, there’s a causal relationship between social isolation and suicide. Conversely, having a crew (“social support” in doctor jargon) has a protective effect against suicide. For every suicidal death, another 20 people attempted suicide.

The takeaway

So what do you do with all this heavy information?

First, remember that the built environment is deliberately planned for us to drive in cars from zone to zone. Planners aren’t trying to destroy our minds, but the built environment increases anxiety, depression, isolation, loneliness, and suicide.

Second, understand the land use catastrophes are reversible. Compact development won’t be legalized overnight, but reform can come as quickly as local leaders are willing. Walk-friendly, bike-friendly, transit-friendly places are good medicine, and they’re made possible at the local level.

Third, and most important of all, know that things can get better in the end. America’s built environment does not fit who we are as humans, but we can turn this around with something as boring as reforming land use planning. Start by legalizing healthy infrastructure—a variety of land uses within walking distance of homes and streets designed for safe walking and cycling.

GM’s sudden shift comes as it prepares for what it calls “irrational” EV discounts to expire at the end of September.

GM cuts EV production as drastic discounts expire

GM sold over 21,000 electric vehicles in August, the most it has ever sold in a single month. Although that’s nearly double the 10,671 crosstown rival Ford sold last month, it apparently isn’t enough.

In a memo sent to employees, GM announced plans to reduce output at its Spring Hill, Tennessee, plant. A source close to the matter confirmed the news to Reuters, claiming GM will halt production of two Cadillac EVs, starting in December.

The Cadillac Lyriq and larger Vistiq, both of which are built at the facility, will see significantly less output during the first five months of 2026.

According to the source, GM plans to suspend one of its two shifts at the facility, resulting in layoffs for workers on the second shift.

In what could be even bigger news, the source said GM is delaying the start of a second shift at its Fairfax assembly plant outside of Kansas City “indefinitely,” where the new Chevy Bolt EV is scheduled to enter production later this year.

GM said it was “making strategic production adjustments in alignment with expected slower EV industry growth and customer demand.”

After reporting August sales numbers, the company said it expects to see strong EV demand in September, but after the $7,500 federal tax credit expires at the end of the month, it expects a slowdown in the fourth quarter.

“We are seeing marginal competitors dramatically scale back their products and plans, which should end much of the overproduction and irrational discounts,” GM said. Although it anticipates a smaller EV market, GM still believes it can grow its market share.

By prioritizing transparent governance, regional cooperation, environmental stewardship, and inclusive development, Ethiopia can lead a transformative pathway for the Horn of Africa.","The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) stands as one of the most ambitious and transformative infrastructure projects in Africa’s modern history. Perched majestically on the Blue Nile River, this colossal dam promises to be a beacon of progress, development, and regional integration—provided it is managed with wisdom, foresight, and cooperation. For Ethiopia, the GERD represents not just a source of clean energy but a foundational pillar for economic growth and poverty alleviation. For the surrounding region, it offers unprecedented opportunities for stability, development, and shared prosperity. Yet, these immense benefits hinge critically on Ethiopia’s ability and willingness to harness the dam with judicious planning and equitable partnerships.

First and foremost, the GERD is poised to revolutionize Ethiopia’s energy sector. With an installed capacity exceeding 6,000 megawatts, it is set to double the nation’s current electricity production, dramatically expanding access to power for millions of Ethiopians who have hitherto lived without reliable electricity. Access to electricity is a cornerstone of modern development—it transforms education, healthcare, industry, and business. The dam’s energy output will catalyze industrialization, enabling Ethiopia to move beyond a primarily agrarian economy to a more diversified, manufacturing-led growth path. This in turn will create jobs, raise incomes, and expand the tax base that funds social services.

Moreover, the GERD’s capacity to deliver clean hydropower aligns perfectly with global imperatives to combat climate change. Ethiopia’s commitment to renewable energy advances a sustainable development model that mitigates reliance on fossil fuels while addressing its own environmental vulnerabilities. This strategic positioning could also attract climate-friendly investments and green finance, further accelerating national development.

Regionally, the GERD offers an opportunity to redefine water resource management on the Nile Basin. Historically, the Nile waters have been a source of tension among Ethiopia, Sudan, and Egypt, owing to complex colonial-era treaties and competing downstream needs. If managed transparently and collaboratively, the dam could shift these dynamics from conflict to cooperation. The regulated flow of water from the dam can reduce devastating floods downstream, provide reliable irrigation support to boost agricultural productivity, and ensure water availability during periods of drought. Sudan, for example, stands to benefit from reduced flood damage and improved electricity imports, creating incentives for constructive partnerships.

Equitable sharing of the GERD’s benefits, however, requires trust-building and clear frameworks for water management. Mechanisms that guarantee transparent data sharing on dam operations, flow rates, and reservoir levels will prove essential. Robust regional agreements must balance Ethiopia’s sovereign right to develop its resources with downstream states’ legitimate water needs. This spirit of cooperation could serve as a blueprint for transboundary water governance across Africa, fostering peace and shared prosperity.

The hydropower generated by GERD also has the potential to stimulate power trade across the Horn of Africa and beyond. Regional power pools can optimize electricity generation and distribution, stabilizing supply and lowering costs. For instance, surplus power from Ethiopia could be exported to energy-deficient neighbors, strengthening economic ties and building interdependence that undergirds political stability. Ambitious cross-border infrastructure projects — power lines, substations, and transmission corridors — will be crucial complements to GERD’s success.

Despite its promise, the dam is not without challenges that require prudent management. Environmental considerations near and around the reservoir must be carefully addressed to prevent negative ecological impacts. Resettlement of affected communities should be conducted with fairness and transparency to avoid social grievances. Furthermore, Ethiopia must invest substantially in its national electricity grid and distribution systems to maximize the dam’s benefits internally.

Financial sustainability is another key facet. While much of the initial funding has come from Ethiopian citizens and institutions, continued investment in maintenance and infrastructure is essential for long-term operation. Harnessing revenues from electricity sales to reinvest in infrastructure and community development will be fundamental.

Importantly, the GERD’s potential will only be fully realized if Ethiopia embraces inclusive governance and strategic planning. National-level policies must ensure that the dam’s benefits extend beyond urban centers to rural, underserved populations. Proactive capacity building in technical, managerial, and regulatory domains will optimize dam operations and water use efficiency.

The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam encapsulates the aspirations of a nation and a region for sustainable growth, energy security, and shared prosperity. It is a powerful symbol of how major infrastructure projects, when wisely stewarded, can unlock national potential and forge regional solidarity. By prioritizing transparent governance, regional cooperation, environmental stewardship, and inclusive development, Ethiopia can lead a transformative pathway for the Horn of Africa. The GERD is not just a dam — it is the cornerstone of a new era, the renaissance of Ethiopia and a hopeful testament to Africa’s ability to rise and thrive in the 21st century. The task ahead is immense, but so too are the rewards for Ethiopians and their neighbors if the journey is navigated with wisdom and unity.",https://capitalethiopia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Editorial.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 14:01:10.483333

Notably, the company is led by Anna Douglas, an alumna of the Innovation Crossroads program based at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL).

SkyNano is not to tackle this project by itself. Alongside them, American Energy Technologies Company and Eonix, steered by Don DeRosa, another Innovation Crossroads alumnus, will join forces to collaboratively spearhead this advancement in battery material technology. This partnership appears to seamlessly blend expertise to potentially create breakthrough developments in the energy sector. Innovation Crossroads, as per ORNL's programs, seems to not only provide rigorous technical support but also connect entrepreneurs to forge such collaborative efforts.

The crossroad of innovation and entrepreneurship is a well-traveled path for alumni of ORNL's specialized program. As Dan Miller of ORNL summarized, ""In addition to accessing world-class technical resources, Innovation Crossroads Fellows are connected with a peer network of early career energy and manufacturing entrepreneurs."" It points out a thriving ecosystem that's been cultivated in East Tennessee, one that has persuaded companies like SkyNano and Eonix to set down roots and expand their operations in the local community.

Anna Douglas, speaking about the importance of this recent development, emphasized the broader impact it holds. ""This project not only represents an important step toward building a secure, domestic supply chain for lithium-ion battery materials, but also continued collaboration and growth among Innovation Crossroads Fellows,"" she said.

Still, manufacturers hope to make EV batteries even better through faster charging and longer lifespans.

A Norwegian University of Science and Technology research team may have found the key to doing just that by creating a new life-extending coating for lithium-sulfur batteries, reported Interesting Engineering.

Li-S batteries are the gold standard for EVs. They can charge faster and are generally safer than lithium-ion batteries.

However, because of the consistent movement of particles inside operating Li-S batteries, they wear out fast. That's a big problem for EV manufacturers prioritizing long-lasting batteries.

To fix this, the NTNU team developed and patented a coating that can potentially extend their lifespan by up to five times. By adding the coating to the battery's separator, which sits between its electrodes, the separator becomes a filter to reduce damage from chemicals moving within the battery.

The longer lifespan can translate to a lighter battery because its cells can store more energy without wearing out as quickly. This higher energy density requires fewer cells within the battery, resulting in a lighter weight.

According to Interesting Engineering, that could make a typical 800-volt EV battery about 440 pounds lighter. Lighter EVs have numerous benefits, including better handling, less tire wear, and extended battery range.

The research team believes this technology could work for other applications, too, such as amplifying the ability of batteries to store excess energy generated from home solar panels.

""The goal is to scale up the technology and license it to an industrial partner so that it can be used in everything from electric cars to storage of green energy,"" said Kristina Nydal, business developer at NTNU's Technology Transfer Office, per IE.

That means that if you use solar panels to charge your EV at home, you may get to eventually double-dip the benefits of this new technology if and when it goes mainstream.

This editorial was authored by Tony Dearing, director of news operations.

You open your electric bill one month, and it’s $66. You think, OK, not bad. But the very next month, that cost has skyrocketed to $340.

Yikes!!!!!

There’s nothing like electricity to put the shock in sticker shock.

Those numbers are no exaggeration. To the dollar, that’s the 415% increase our reporter Katie Kausch saw in her July bill from JCP&L. She cited her own experience in an article asking New Jerseyans what they think about the staggering jump in electrical costs. Spoiler alert: They’re mad as hell.

So angry, in fact, that this issue may decide the election for governor, depending on who voters decide to blame.

If you’re looking for a culprit, you’ve got so many options.

The easiest target is PJM Interconnection, a regional organization that manages the power grid across the East Coast, including New Jersey, and plays a key role in setting wholesale prices for electricity.

PJM plodded along in obscurity for decades, setting electrical prices through an annual “capacity” auction.

Then came the 2024 auction, and the lid blew off.

Faced with voracious demand for electricity and a declining supply, the cost of securing a reliable supply of electricity across the region spiked to $14.7 billion, compared to $2.2 billion the previous year. That staggering cost is now being passed on to you as a consumer.

PJM says it’s just responding to market realities, and while it is by no means blameless, there are bigger players to be fingered here.

Tom Martello, our sage political columnist, recently called out the “two biggest elephants in the room” — Gov. Phil Murphy and President Donald Trump. Regardless of your political leanings, there’s blame to heap on either.

Here’s what it boils down to. Our traditional sources of electrical energy — such as coal and nuclear — are on the wane. One of our three nuclear plants shuttered in 2018, and New Jersey’s last remaining coal-burning power plants shut down in the early 2020s.

We need new ways to generate our own electricity, and it’s not happening nearly fast enough, leaving us overly reliant on power from elsewhere. We now know how cruel the cost of that can be.

Critics blame Murphy for staking New Jersey’s future too heavily on massive wind turbines proposed off the Jersey Shore, and then failing to deliver on that promise. His vision of N.J. as a center of wind energy tanked two years ago the Danish company Ørsted canceled its Ocean Wind 1 and 2 projects due to inflation, rising interest rates and supply chain issues.

Then came Trump, who loathes clean energy projects like “windmills,” as he calls them. On his first day in office, he issued a memorandum designed to stall off-shore wind projects.

Trump has since removed federal subsidies for wind and solar, and as recently as last month, halted work on a wind farm nearing completion off the coast of Rhode Island.

Neither Murphy nor Trump is on the ballot in November, but their specter hangs over both candidates running for governor.

The Republican nominee, Jack Ciattarelli, is endorsed by Trump but finds himself doing a “delicate dance” as he deals with the unpopularity of Trump’s policies on Medicaid and immigration here in New Jersey.

Meanwhile, the Democratic hopeful, Mikie Sherrill, must distance herself from Murphy, whose popularity continues to decline by the day as he approaches the end of his second term.

Who will voters choose to punish this fall for the outrageous cost of electricity?

That’s the wrong question. What voters should ask themselves instead is, which candidate’s policies will give New Jersey the best chance of lowering electrical costs in the near future?

Because this problem has become so complex and intractable, you could be facing higher and higher electric bills for years to come.

We believe the best opportunity for lower electrical costs sooner lies in clean, renewable energy sources.

Maybe not wind turbines — despite New Jersey’s wind resources like its enviable sea breeze and proximity to the jet stream. Between Murphy’s failure to deliver and Trump’s antipathy, it would be hard to revive the momentum for offshore wind farms. And public support for that has been ebbing here in New Jersey anyway.

A Stockton poll last fall showed a narrow majority of New Jerseyans support offshore wind turbines, well down from the whopping 80% who favored wind power in 2019. And while only 26% strongly reject this idea, the opposition here is vocal and well-organized.

But other clean energy options, including solar and batteries, remain both viable and popular in the Garden State. In that same poll, a comfortable majority of state residents preferred renewable energy over fossil fuels, compared to the 37% who said fossil fuels are the better choice for increasing our energy supply.

Current state policy favors renewable energy, and now would be the wrong time to turn our back on that option. Other choices, be they fossil fuels or nuclear power, come with their own issues. And new plants powered by these sources can take anywhere from four years to a decade to get up and running.

Customers in New Jersey need relief from the high cost of electricity sooner than that. Solutions like solar and battery are less expensive and can typically be brought into production in a couple of years.

And that should be New Jersey’s choice. We don’t want our options dictated by climate deniers or others whose attitudes about energy are as fossilized and the fuels they favor. We need to chart our own course here.

If you want to know where the gubernatorial candidates stand on energy policy, you can get a detailed look by using our NJ Elections Chat tool on NJ.com. The at-a-glance answer is:

Ciattarelli wants to ban offshore wind, overhaul the state’s energy strategy and increase natural gas generation, which Murphy cut back on.

Sherrill wants to increase spending on solar and nuclear energy, modernize the natural gas infrastructure and vows a ban on any increase in the price of electricity next year.

But we encourage you to go deeper, and educate yourself on how each candidate proposes to approach this important pocketbook issue.

While we favor clean energy options, we understand that natural gas figures prominently in our current and future energy portfolio, and even those are only part of the answer on a public policy issue this complex and vexing.

More transparency and accountability are needed in the way PJM sets wholesale rates and around its epically dysfunctional permit process for getting new supplies of energy connected to the power grid.

And yes, the other elephant in the room is the proliferation of AI data centers that are sucking up massive amounts of electricity, which in turn drives up electrical cost that we now are paying through the nose for. We’ll take on these concerns in future editorials.

But in terms of energy policy, the future is now.

In this political season, electricity has become a lightning-rod issue. The choices that an angry electorate make in November will define where our power comes from and what it costs for years to come.

Clean, renewable energy is cheaper and could give us relief sooner. Why would New Jersey turn its back on that now when we need it more than ever?

Calling your elected representative in the state Assembly or Senate is the most effective way to influence policy. To find your state Assemblymember and Senator to voice your position, go to the New Jersey Legislature website’s Legislative Roster.

The new technology works by directing particle beams at stored atomic waste.
Fusion power combines deuterium and tritium atoms to create energy, just like the process that powers stars.
On one hand, fusion reactors could generate huge amounts of electricity with minimal radioactive by-products.
These innovations could help communities move away from pollution-heavy power sources and create jobs in emerging energy sectors.","American researchers have found a way to turn atomic waste materials into tritium, a necessary fuel for fusion reactors, reported Interesting Engineering.

This technology solves a pressing problem: America is sitting on thousands of tons of atomic waste from decades of nuclear power generation, but it must import all its tritium, a hydrogen isotope needed for fusion energy.

""Right now, the value of commercial tritium is about $15 million per pound [$33 million per kilogram], and the U.S. doesn't have any domestic capability to create it,"" explained Terence Tarnowsky, a physicist at Los Alamos National Laboratory, per IE.

The new technology works by directing particle beams at stored atomic waste. When atoms break apart, they create neutrons that eventually form tritium through a chain of reactions.

Unlike traditional reactors, workers can activate or deactivate the process as needed, which makes the process safer.

Computer simulations indicate a single reactor that consumes 1 billion watts could generate roughly 4.4 pounds of tritium each year. That's more than 10 times what comparable fusion systems might create.

Fusion power combines deuterium and tritium atoms to create energy, just like the process that powers stars. While deuterium exists in abundance in seawater, tritium is scarce. Canada's reactors currently produce most of the world's supply, and Earth's total inventory sits at just 55 pounds.

Nuclear power could help us meet our energy needs, but in its current state, it presents obstacles.

On one hand, fusion reactors could generate huge amounts of electricity with minimal radioactive by-products. Compare this to today's fission plants, which leave behind dangerous materials that need millennia of storage.

On the other hand, nuclear technology hurdles include high costs, safety concerns, and public skepticism about past accidents.

This recycling approach addresses the foremost concern by turning a costly burden into valuable fuel. Instead of paying billions to store radioactive materials for thousands of years, facilities could convert waste into tritium worth millions per pound while powering future clean energy systems.

If you support the advancement of clean energy solutions, consider contacting your representatives to discuss funding for fusion research and waste recycling technologies. These innovations could help communities move away from pollution-heavy power sources and create jobs in emerging energy sectors.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/tritiumimage-recrKQqxFsC2NS0r4.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 13:03:53.584094

Increased EV competition accelerates the transition away from gas-powered vehicles, cutting pollution faster.
""The YU7 will outsell the Model Y because they have more tech and are priced lower to undercut the competition.","The world's best-selling electric vehicle has some competition. This month in China, Xiaomi unveiled its new YU7 electric SUV, positioned squarely against the Model Y with a lower price tag, competitive tech integrations, sleek, sporty design, and vibrant colors. Tesla's foothold at the top of the EV market is being seriously challenged — and consumers should pay attention.

""In China, the Model Y is already feeling the impact of Xiaomi's YU7,"" reported Electrek.

Xiaomi's CEO Lei Jun is not mincing words when it comes to his goal for the company. Xiaomi ""has set a goal for the YU7 to outsell the Tesla Model Y, the best-selling electric premium SUV, in China,"" reported Electrek in June.

As YU7 orders skyrocket, Model Y purchases are falling. This mimics the performance of Xiaomi's first EV, which is comparable to the Model 3 and has outsold its Tesla counterpart since its release.

For buyers, this competition could be a win. Xiaomi's YU7 reportedly undercuts the Model Y on price while offering similar features. That kind of innovation forces Tesla to either drive down costs or significantly improve quality for customers worldwide. Greater choice at more competitive prices is exactly what EV shoppers want, especially in a time when affordability is a major barrier to widespread EV adoption.

Increased EV competition accelerates the transition away from gas-powered vehicles, cutting pollution faster. Increased production also requires more and more batteries and mineral mining, but the mining needed for the clean energy transition is a fraction of what is done annually for the oil industry.

Ultimately, Tesla's battle with Xiaomi signals a changing EV landscape. Consumers are hungry for a growing market, and China offers one of the most competitive car markets in the world.

""There are numerous cars coming out of the woodwork there regularly,"" wrote one commenter. ""The YU7 will outsell the Model Y because they have more tech and are priced lower to undercut the competition. This is what all competitors in China have to deal with, not just Tesla. It will be interesting to see who is still selling cars in China in a few years.""

""For the last 5 years, the American automaker enjoyed some dominance in the Chinese market, but now local companies have caught up and Xiaomi is one of the best examples,"" said Electrek.

A Case Study in Short-Termism Politicizing projects like Revolution Wind serves no one’s long-term interests.
Conclusion In the end, the decision to halt Revolution Wind is a case study in how political short-termism can sabotage economic rationality.","The abrupt halt of Ørsted’s Revolution Wind project off Rhode Island has become one of the most striking examples yet of political interference derailing sound economic logic. This was not a struggling venture or a risky experimental bet. It was a nearly complete, multi-billion-dollar project designed to deliver clean power to more than 350,000 households. Eighty percent of the turbines were already in place, the investment had largely been sunk, and the project had a clear pathway to profitability. Yet the U.S. government ordered a stop, citing vague national security concerns. The decision has rattled markets, hammered Ørsted’s stock, and left observers questioning how reliable the American policy environment is for large-scale energy investments.

Economic Sense, Political Nonsense

For Ørsted, the project represented both a cornerstone of its U.S. ambitions and a test case for its ability to scale offshore wind in one of the world’s most important energy markets. For the United States, Revolution Wind was more than a power plant, it was a strategic infrastructure project. It promised to strengthen grid reliability in New England, diversify the regional energy mix, and provide a secure, local source of electricity at competitive prices. Jobs were created, supply chains were mobilized, and construction was already transforming the landscape. In every respect, the economics of the project made sense not just for Ørsted and its partners, but also for the communities and consumers who stood to benefit from it.

Signals to Investors

The logic of halting such a project is difficult to reconcile. At a time when global capital is increasingly cautious about deploying billions into long-term infrastructure, the United States had successfully attracted one of the world’s leading offshore wind developers. Years of regulatory approvals had been navigated, financing secured, and state-level political support firmly in place. To pull the plug so late in the process, with billions already spent and the project nearly ready to deliver power, sends a chilling signal to investors: no matter how advanced a project may be, no matter how rigorous the permitting process, politics can still override economics at the final stage.

Offshore Wind Is No Gamble

This is particularly damaging because offshore wind is not a fringe technology. In Europe, it is already a backbone of the energy system, delivering reliable power at scale. Costs have fallen sharply over the past decade, making it one of the most competitive forms of renewable generation. Revolution Wind was structured with long-term power purchase agreements, providing predictable revenue and stable returns. Its role in stabilizing the New England grid had been recognized by regional operators. By almost any measure, this was exactly the type of project that energy economists point to when they talk about the viability of renewables.

Ørsted’s Losses, America’s Losses

The consequences for Ørsted have been severe. Already under pressure from rising global costs and earlier project delays, the company saw its market value tumble to historic lows after the halt was announced. Its ability to raise new capital, including an emergency injection to stabilize its balance sheet, has been thrown into question. For a company once held up as a global leader in the energy transition, the setback is dramatic, threatening to undermine its broader U.S. growth strategy.

A Chill Across the Market

Yet the impact extends far beyond a single company. For the United States, halting Revolution Wind represents a lost opportunity to reinforce energy security with a domestic, low-carbon resource. Instead, New England will remain more reliant on natural gas imports and on an aging grid that is increasingly strained by extreme weather events. Consumers are likely to face higher costs and greater volatility as a result. And perhaps most significantly, the decision undermines America’s credibility as a destination for energy investment. If even projects that are 80 percent complete can be stopped on political whim, why would any global developer commit billions to the next offshore wind farm, or to hydrogen hubs, or to long-duration storage?

Geopolitics or Ideology?

Some have speculated that the halt may have less to do with the project itself and more to do with geopolitics. Denmark, Ørsted’s home country, has clashed with Washington in the past over issues ranging from Arctic policy to Greenland. Others see the decision as part of a broader ideological push against renewable energy from the current U.S. administration. Whatever the true motives, the result is the same: an erosion of trust in the stability of U.S. policymaking.

The Transition Will Not Stop

The irony is that stopping Revolution Wind will not halt the energy transition. Global momentum behind renewables continues, driven by economics as much as by climate goals. The cost trajectory of wind and solar, combined with storage, makes them increasingly competitive against fossil fuels. Demand from corporations and states for clean power remains strong, regardless of federal policy swings. What the halt does accomplish, however, is to delay the U.S. in securing its share of that momentum. Other regions will move faster, attract more capital, and develop the industries and jobs that come with leadership in clean energy.

A Case Study in Short-Termism

Politicizing projects like Revolution Wind serves no one’s long-term interests. It undermines investor confidence, discourages innovation, and deprives consumers of cost-effective power. For the U.S. economy, it risks leaving the country less competitive in the industries of the future. For the global climate effort, it removes a project that would have delivered meaningful emissions reductions. And for companies like Ørsted, it reinforces the perception that the U.S. is not a reliable partner for long-horizon energy infrastructure.

Conclusion

In the end, the decision to halt Revolution Wind is a case study in how political short-termism can sabotage economic rationality. Here was a project that ticked every box: nearly finished, financially sound, socially beneficial, and strategically important. Instead of celebrating its completion, the U.S. government chose to halt it, leaving investors and partners bewildered. The damage will be felt for years, not only by Ørsted, but by every energy company now rethinking whether America is a safe place to bet on the future.

But you've got a very narrow window here in northern Minnesota between when trees drop their leaves and when the ground freezes.","NARY, Minn. — Brian Ingmire’s mission to help reforest northern Minnesota with trees from south of here became a lot more important after the June 21 storm that leveled millions of trees in the Bemidji area.

Ingmire and his wife, Trina, own the 10-acre New North Farm southeast of Bemidji in Hubbard County. They sell Certified Naturally Grown produce at Bemidji’s Natural Choice Farmers Market on Saturdays. They also raise sheep and chickens.

Brian is a member of the Farm & Forest Growers Cooperative, a network of small farms and nurseries that grow climate-adaptive tree seeds into seedlings, and then sell the seedlings to reforestation agencies and individuals.

“Minnesota has a massive need for tree seedlings,” Ingmire said. “Something like 10 million trees are needed every year at a minimum. And we have a lot of forest disturbance, whether it’s fires or wind events.”

Ingmire figures he has about 30,000 tree seedlings on his farm, and about two-thirds of them will be available for purchase this fall. Online orders can be placed at climatesmarttrees.com. He's also been selling seedlings at his Bemidji Natural Choice Farmers Market booth, and says having them there gives him an opportunity to talk about the project.

New North Farm is one of 24 members of the cooperative. Ingmire is growing several varieties, including red oak, burr oak, yellow birch and silver maple. All are collected from about 200 miles south and then started up north.

“I can tell you where their parent tree came from,” Ingmire said. “They should be able to handle the changes in temperature extremes. We’ve got different insect pests and fungal pests that are putting stressors on trees just because of the temperature extremes. These trees should have the genetic ability to deal with that kind of extreme.”

The need for reforestation was certainly exacerbated in the Bemidji area after the June storm. It is estimated that Beltrami County lost nine million trees, and many were also downed in parts of Hubbard and Cass counties.

“That number exceeds a lot of the nursery capacity that we have,” Ingmire said.

Trees that are purchased this fall should be planted right away to ensure their survival.

“Most of our sales will be done for spring planting,” Ingmire said, “but I would like to see as many available in the fall as possible. I think the trees do better when they're planted in the fall. But you've got a very narrow window here in northern Minnesota between when trees drop their leaves and when the ground freezes. Some years you've got a month to get all that done, and some years you've got two weeks.”

Listening to Ingmire talk about the seedling program, his gardens and forest ecology, it’s clear to see his passion for science and the environment.

""In a lot of ways it’s a spiritual thing for me,"" he said. ""You either set everything aside and you take a preservationist mindset where nature's best left without man touching it, or you recognize that we as humans have a unique role and responsibility to participate and be part of the natural world. There's really no separation between the two of them.""

He noted that the impacts humans have are global, but that these impacts start on a local level.

""One tree at a time, or one farm that's growing vegetables that feed people. So you can choose to participate in a lot of different ways,"" Ingmire said. ""The way that I choose to participate is to imagine and envision what it could be, and then work to model that and make it happen. And help other people do the same.""

Ingmire's full-time job is with the Minnesota Department of Agriculture as a water certification specialist. It’s a position that allows for flexibility, especially during the growing season, and it also allows him to visit with farmers throughout the region.

He has a degree in natural resources and environmental maintenance from Ball State University in his native Indiana. He did graduate work at Western Kentucky University and Indiana University before becoming a science teacher at the junior college and high school level.

After that, he managed water quality programs for the Environmental Protection Agency and spent 13 years as a conservation planner and trainer with the United States Department of Agriculture.

The Ingmires moved to Minnesota nearly four years ago after he started his current position with the MDA. But finding the right place to live was a bit of a challenge for Brian and Trina.

“It was right in the middle of COVID,” Brian said. “Interest rates were starting to go up. Everybody was racing to get a place.”

The couple had planned to visit five properties in the Bemidji area, but by the time they arrived, three of them had been sold.

“The first one we looked at was just a nightmare,” Brian said. Even the farm they bought didn’t look right when they pulled into the snow-covered driveway.

“It looked horrible,” Brian said. “We didn’t have any photos of the inside of the house. The doors were open on the sheds when we pulled in. It hadn’t been plowed. But then we got into the house and it had a bank of south-facing windows and all the sun was shining through. We thought, ‘This is it. We can do this.’”

Fast forward four years, and Brian and Trina have created a pristine and productive farm, with a lot of sweat equity and a little help from their hungry sheep.

“I was looking at soil maps and thought it should be good,” Brian said. “It’s prime agricultural land. We had a lot of little surprises when everything thawed. There were piles of trash, it was all grown over and full of boxelder. Kind of daunting, but I was ready for it. I was just ready to have my own piece of land, and I had ideas I wanted to try out.”",https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/6270a4e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5712x4284+0+0/resize/1421x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F68%2F20%2Fa80e09dd49a3ae86822b44a6ae3b%2Fingmire2.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 14:01:19.441352

But the city’s green goals have also drawn a critical eye from Florida’s Department of Governmental Efficiency, or DOGE, which is auditing the city alongside several other local governments across the state.
In his recent State of the City speech, Mayor Buddy Dyer said that the city was on track to run city facilities with solar by early 2027 — an initiative he said boasts environmental and economic benefits.
Solar is a good investment for cities like Orlando because city workers will occupy their buildings for long periods of time, he said.
City staffers leading the city’s green initiatives were also interviewed by DOGE auditors when they visited City Hall last month, an official said.","Orlando is on the verge of powering its municipal buildings entirely by renewable energy, and is on pace to reach that goal three years ahead of schedule.

But the city’s green goals have also drawn a critical eye from Florida’s Department of Governmental Efficiency, or DOGE, which is auditing the city alongside several other local governments across the state.

In his recent State of the City speech, Mayor Buddy Dyer said that the city was on track to run city facilities with solar by early 2027 — an initiative he said boasts environmental and economic benefits.

“Yes, this is about fighting climate change. But it’s also about saving money and increasing operational efficiency,” Dyer said. “It’s an up-front investment that pays for itself over time, and then generates a return in dollars, jobs and other tangible benefits.”

The city council first set the goal in 2017, alongside a larger target of powering the entire city with renewable sources by 2050. Other cities, like Burlington, Vermont and Aspen, Colorado, have entirely renewable electrical grids, though Dyer has strived to position Orlando as the most sustainable city in the southeast.

The city’s solar investments also continue, with about 10 new systems expected to be added by the end of 2026 on buildings ranging from community centers to fire stations to the city’s fleet and facilities headquarters.

Between now and the third quarter of 2026, that’s about a $4 million investment, said Mike Hess, the city’s director of sustainability, resilience and future-ready.

At the city’s fleet and facilities building — where employees maintain, repair and replace a range of vehicles and equipment like police cars and solid waste trucks — the new solar system will produce more energy than is used there, Hess said.

Solar is a good investment for cities like Orlando because city workers will occupy their buildings for long periods of time, he said. New solar systems are expected to last about 25 years, and should be entirely paid off in 10 years, meaning taxpayers would reap savings for 15 years.

“If we’re installing roughly $4 million in solar projects … 10 years from now, our taxpayers are going to start to see a $400,000 per year savings on our energy bills,” Hess said.“Ten-year paybacks are great for us because we’re going to own our buildings for a long, long time.”

These investments come as NASA confirmed 2024 was the warmest year recorded, which scientists have blamed on carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases, which trap heat.

Environmental policies, however, have been some of the biggest targets of Florida DOGE, which Gov. Ron DeSantis and CFO Blaise Ingoglia has characterized as looking for waste and inefficiency but has included scouring records for phrases it deems ideologically suspect.

In its letter demanding a slew of records, DOGE asked the city to turn over documents and data about any “Green New Deal” policies related to climate change, carbon reduction, as well as capital and operating expenses of any such programs.

The Green New Deal itself was a 2019 proposal from U.S. Rep Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. that did not advance in Congress and has no connection with local environmental initiatives such as Orlando’s.

City staffers leading the city’s green initiatives were also interviewed by DOGE auditors when they visited City Hall last month, an official said.

Despite the increase in solar usage, the Orlando Utilities Commission, which is city-owned, still relies on coal at its Stanton Energy Plant — at least for now. The utility intends to phase out coal and natural gas by 2050 in favor of solar and renewable sources. It announced in 2020 it would stop burning coal there in 2027 and switch to natural gas.

City leaders have also sought to reduce the energy needed to power its facilities by 20% since 2011. The city issued a $17.5 million bond to cover 55 projects across the city, including switching lights to LED, replacing HVAC systems with more energy-efficient models and automating buildings with smart systems to control usage. Such upgrades were done at the Kia Center, City Hall, fire stations, community centers and other facilities.

Dyer said the results were $2.5 million in annual energy savings.

The announcement came with surprises. Ford said it will discontinue the Escape, its second-best-selling SUV, and the Lincoln Corsair after the 2026 model year. Both models are currently built at the Louisville facility, which will be repurposed to produce the new generation of affordable EVs.

Ford has invested about $5 billion into the plant, creating nearly 4,000 jobs in preparation for this shift. The company says the new truck will be part of a family of lower-cost EVs that are expected to expand consumer access to clean transportation.

Electric vehicles are gaining traction worldwide as automakers push out new models at lower price points. EVs save drivers money by eliminating oil changes and many fluid replacements, cutting fuel costs, and reducing long-term maintenance. They also operate with quieter engines and produce no tailpipe pollution. Drivers can explore how to make their next car an EV with more resources available for first-time buyers.

Some critics point to the environmental impact of mining for lithium and other minerals used in batteries. Research shows the clean energy transition requires about 30 million tons of minerals each year, but the world currently extracts about 16.5 billion tons of dirty energy annually, which is burned and cannot be reused, unlike battery materials — so electric is still better for the planet.

Studies also show EVs quickly pay off their environmental footprint — a Tesla Model 3 offsets its manufacturing costs after just 13,500 miles compared with a Toyota Corolla, according to Reuters.

The benefits grow when EVs are paired with home solar panels, which lower charging costs even further. Fueling with solar energy is cheaper than using public stations or the grid, and EnergySage makes it easy to compare local installer quotes and save up to $10,000 on installations.

GET THE LATEST BREAKING NEWS HERE -- SIGN UP FOR GOLOCAL FREE DAILY EBLAST

Republican Rhode Island Governor Don Carcieri was a conservative, pro-business politician. Socially, he was opposed to gay marriage and abortion.

First elected in 2002, Carcieri promised to cut state government and create 20,000 jobs.

His two terms were bumpy as he often clashed with the Democratic legislature.

In Carcieri’s final years, he pushed two major economic development strategies. The first economic development initiative involved a funding scheme that provided $75 million to 38 Studios, a video game company founded by former Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling.

That was an almost immediate failure, with the company going into bankruptcy in less than two years after Carcieri and the Economic Development Corporation (EDC) pushed through the massive public spending for the fledgling company. The investment, bankruptcy, and legal actions made Rhode Island national news. It was an abject embarrassment.

The second Carcieri initiative was to create an offshore wind industry in Rhode Island. Massachusetts had first attempted to build an offshore wind project in America, but powerful interests, including U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy, the Koch brothers, and even Walter Cronkite, opposed the Cape Wind project.

The offshore wind industry began in earnest in Rhode Island in 2008, as Carcieri pushed through legislation to start the wind industry in the state.

It took almost a decade, and the first successful project in America was Deepwater Wind.

The Beginning - Big Goals

In September of 2008, Carcieri announced that Deepwater Wind was chosen as the developer to construct a wind energy project off the shores of Rhode Island that could provide 1.3 million megawatt-hours (MWh) of electricity per year, 15 percent of all electricity used in the state. It was expected that the project would cost more than $1 billion to construct, with all the capital coming from private investment sources.

“Today marks a major step to bring wind power to Rhode Island and to reach our goal of at least 15 percent of all electricity in the state be renewable energy,” Carcieri said at the time. “Of the many forms of renewable energy alternatives available, wind is the proven leader. Wind power is clean, green power that is not subject to variations and increases in fuel prices. Rhode Island is uniquely positioned to lead the nation with the development of this country’s first offshore wind farm.”

Democratic Opposition

The lead opponent to the project was the Democratic Rhode Island Attorney General.

In July of 2010, GoLocal reported that Attorney General Patrick Lynch took his opposition to the proposed wind farm off Block Island to the next level, announcing he was challenging the constitutionality of a new law that allowed the project to move forward.

As reported, the law would send the issue back to the Public Utilities Commission, which had already once turned down a proposed contract between National Grid and Deepwater Wind, After the law took effect, Deepwater Wind filed a new proposed contract with the PUC.

“We continue to fight against this special-interest measure and inside deal tailored to put only one entity, Deepwater Wind, on the fast track to develop a costly demonstration project that isn’t needed and will create only six full-time jobs,” said Lynch, who at the time was a Democratic candidate for governor.

“It’s an exercise in futility that will not spur economic development in Rhode Island, will not generate much-needed jobs for our residents in a cutting-edge industry and, despite its supporters’ promises, provides absolutely no guarantee that our state will rise as the primary purveyor of affordable wind energy along the Atlantic coast,"" Lynch added.

Charges of Inside Deal

Carcieri hammered away at Lynch for saying the new law was “an inside deal” tailored to favor just one company—Deepwater Wind.

“The Attorney General is making a reckless charge that the new law was the result of an inside deal tailored to favor one developer,” said Carcieri at the time. “The Attorney General should know that there was a competitive process to select a preferred developer for the proposed wind farm. The process was open, transparent, and based on competitive scoring of all interested applicants.”

Carcieri said Deepwater Wind was chosen because it had the lowest energy price, the strongest financial assets, and could commit to creating jobs in Rhode Island.

“The Attorney General is either uninformed or misleading the public – which is it?” Carcieri concluded.

The project was ultimately cut down to a pilot project located off Block Island.

After a battle to get the pilot project approved, Deepwater was off and running, but faced challenges, including financing, legal, and local zoning.

In May of 2017, Block Island switched over and was powered by Deepwater — making American history.

The success of the project made global news, and the Block Island project was featured in a national Citi ad.

Today, the success of Deepwater seems forgotten, and the offshore wind industry is mired in political and legal chaos.

It all started in Rhode Island.

The SPEED Act takes aim at the scientific foundation of environmental review

By guest contributor Justin Pidot.

On September 10, the House Natural Resources Committee will convene a hearing on the SPEED Act—the latest NEPA reform bill championed by Chairman Bruce Westerman. The bill includes provisions that would fundamentally compromise the integrity of federal decision making processes by allowing—or even compelling—the government to ignore scientific and technical information critical to understanding the effects of a federal action and how those effects could be mitigated.

This component of the SPEED Act would operate against the backdrop of a provision Congress added to NEPA in 2023 to limit an agency’s obligation to generate new information. NEPA section 106 (b)(3), which addresses the threshold question of whether to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS), provides an agency:

“is not required to undertake new scientific or technical research unless the new scientific or technical research is essential to a reasoned choice among alternatives, and the overall costs and time frame of obtaining it are not unreasonable.”

This approach to new information strikes a balance, an appropriate one in my view, between analytical integrity and efficiency. The SPEED Act would obliterate that balance by providing that an agency is also not required:

“to undertake new scientific and technical research after the receipt of an application, as applicable, with respect to such proposed agency action.”

If you’re scratching your head trying to parse the language precisely, you’re in good company. I think the convoluted text running from “receipt” to “proposed agency action” describing the covered circumstances simply means whenever an agency receives an application, but maybe there’s a nuance I’m missing.

But that text certainly seems to provide that where it applies, an agency never needs to perform scientific or technical research, no matter how essential or reasonably obtained.

The SPEED Act would add even more capacious (and clearer) provisions to section 107—which addresses conducting environmental reviews—providing:

“no Federal agency shall be required to consider any scientific or technical research that becomes publicly available” after the agency has received an application or published a notice of intent (NOI) to prepare an environmental document, whichever comes sooner; and

“[a] Federal agency may not delay the issuance of an environmental document or a final agency action . . . on the basis of awaiting new scientific or technical information.”

One consequence of those provisions is that they would allow agencies to entirely ignore information provided during public comment periods, including a provision of the 2023 NEPA amendments requiring agencies to take comment on NOIs—which, by definition, occur after the NOI is published.

It is Orwellian indeed to require an agency to seek input from the public that the agency is expressly excused from having to consider. And if you’re wondering if this is an intended consequence, it clearly is, because the bill specifies that permitting agencies to ignore information in environmental review processes does not affect their obligation under the Administrative Procedure Act to respond to comment when issuing or revising regulations.

So far, I’ve talked about the consequences of the SPEED Act in abstract terms. Here’s a concrete example of two agencies developing essential information that would be compromised: In 2003, the BLM and Forest Service commenced an EIS for a proposal to expand a phosphate mine in Idaho and dispose of toxic waste from the expansion at a site nearby. Evaluating the risk of contaminating streams, rivers, and groundwater in the area required information about the geology of the disposal site. But as is typical, that kind of detailed site-specific information didn’t exist when the environmental review process began. So, during the EIS process (which concluded in 2006), more than 50 bore holes were drilled to characterize the geochemistry of the site. Information from that research enabled development of a new alternative in the final EIS with improved engineering of the disposal site. That alternative, enabled by research occurring during the environmental review, was ultimately adopted.

This kind of circumstance isn’t unusual. The environmental review process often involves some degree of research on the:

natural resources occurring in a project area

amount of air pollution a project will generate, where it will end up, and how that may impact people’s health

fate of oil or chemicals released in an accident and how they could be contained

area’s risks of wildfire, flood, earthquake or other natural disasters; and

hydrology of the area and how a project could pollute drinking water or reduce water supply.

Developing information about those kinds of things is central to the NEPA process and can often be done quickly and affordably.

The SPEED Act’s approach would have further, and I suspect unintended, consequences: It would encourage development in locations where we know less about the environment; and it would encourage the use of less tested technologies and methods. That’s because analysis would only be required to the extent that technical and scientific information is already available. In other words, if we know nothing, no analysis needs to occur.

By calcifying scientific and technical information at the moment an agency receives an application, or publishes an NOI, the SPEED Act would enable the government to turn a willfully blind eye to inconvenient information about harms to human health, air and water quality, biodiversity, and other aspects of the human environment. That’s a recipe for ill-conceived decisions, not better government.",https://legal-planet.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/NEPA-2.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 11:01:33.360291

Automakers can chase longer range, but that drives up cost. They can make the battery charge very rapidly, but that can shorten its lifespan. Push too far in one direction and something else inevitably gives.

To make a battery that’s great at all those aspects is tough, but automakers and battery companies have signed up for the challenge regardless, thanks to solid-state batteries.

If solid-state batteries are manufactured at scale, they can offer an ideal balance of range, safety, performance and fast-charging in a similar or a smaller pack size. There’s a reason why scientists call it the “holy grail” of battery technology.

These batteries replace the liquid electrolyte, the chemical that facilitates the charge and discharge cycles, with a solid one. The solid materials theoretically perform better, but they’re difficult to manufacture in large volumes without defects.

Even if battery companies succeed, they won’t turn things around overnight. Research firm BloombergNEF projects solid-state batteries to account for just 10% of global EV and battery storage demand by 2035. The exact path to scalability and commercialization still looks murky, and the initial rollout could be concentrated in premium EVs.

In the meantime, semi-solid-state batteries are gaining traction. These batteries use a gel-like electrolyte that also promises improvements over traditional lithium-ion batteries. Chinese battery companies have established a firm lead in this space, with 83% of current or planned solid-state battery manufacturing capacity all concentrated in China, BNEF said.

EVs with semi-solid-state batteries are already rolling out in China, albeit in small numbers. Customers can buy and drive them today, thanks to early adopters such as Nio and the state-backed SAIC Motors that invested in the tech early. In the West, Mercedes-Benz and BMW are testing solid-state batteries, and Stellantis is planning to begin trials next year.

Japanese and Korean automakers are also working on this tech, but they’ve been tight-lipped about their plans. In 2022, Nikkei reported that Toyota held the highest number of solid-state battery patents, followed by Panasonic and Idemitsu.

In this list, we’re covering both semi-solid-state and all-solid-state batteries. Some of these EVs are already on the market in China, while others are planned to go on sale in the coming years. A few of them are demo cars, but we’re including them in the list anyway. We’re also including automakers that have not yet installed solid-state batteries in an actual EV, but have shown the intent to do so. The list covers both Chinese EVs as well as some Western models that are in the works.

Nio ET7/ET5

Battery type: Semi-solid state

Energy Density: 360 watt hours per kilogram

Supplier: Beijing WeLion New Energy Technology

Claimed Range: 652 miles (1,050 kilometers)

In late 2023, Nio’s Founder, Chairman, and CEO William Li got behind the wheel of the sleek ET7 sedan and drove more than 648 miles on a single charge. He did that in real-world conditions and, moreover, in frigid temperatures, the automaker claimed. The ET7 was equipped with a 150 kWh semi-solid-state battery, which is available to rent for Nio EV owners in China for a per-day fee. It’s a great idea: Do your daily driving using the brand's small 70-75 kWh packs and switch to solid-state via battery swapping before long road trips.

IM Motors L6

Battery type: Semi-solid state

Supplier: Suzhou QingTao Power Technology

Range: 620+ miles (1,000 km)

IM Motors is the luxury arm of China’s state backed SAIC Motors. SAIC has made a significant headway into semi-solid-state batteries with multiple models on sale already in China.

The IM L6 rivals the Tesla Model 3 and the Xiaomi SU7. Its entry-level versions get lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) batteries, but it’s also available with a 133 kWh semi-solid-state pack that’s good for more than 620 miles of range on the China Light-Duty Test Cycle (CLTC). A 900-volt architecture makes adding 248 miles of range in just 12 minutes of charging possible, with a powerful enough charger. It’s priced between 230,000 and 330,000 yuan ($28,000-$45,600).

MG4

Battery type: Semi-solid state

Energy Density: 180 Wh/kg

Supplier: Suzhou QingTao Power Technology

British carmaker MG Motor is another SAIC owned brand benefitting from semi-solid-state batteries. MG made waves recently by announcing the launch of the first affordable mass market EV powered by a semi-solid-state battery later this year. The battery size and range are still unknown, but MG said the cells use only 5% liquid electrolyte. The prices look competitive, too. The MG4 is available with both LFP and semi-solid state batteries, costing between 73,800 and 105,800 yuan ($10,100-14,400).

Voyah Passion (Locally called Voyah Zhuiguang)

Voyah Passion/Zhuiguang

Battery type: Semi-solid state

Range: 360 miles

Voyah, the premium brand under China’s Dongfeng Motor Corporation, launched the Passion sedan in China in 2023 in both plug-in hybrid and battery-electric versions. Its 82 kWh semi-solid-state battery is installed in the entry-level version, whereas the 109 kWh lithium-ion battery is the one with significantly more range, as per local news reports. The 82 kWh pack is good for 360 miles of CLTC range, whereas the bigger pack can deliver 453 miles. It's priced between 322,900 and 432,000 yuan ($45,000-$60,000).

The semi-solid state pack was an early generation of the battery, and the automaker is reportedly working on its third generation solid-state tech.

Dongfeng Fengshen E70 (Demo EV)

Battery type: Semi-solid state

Range: 620+ miles

Supplier: Ganfeng Lithium

China’s DongFeng Motor Corporation started testing semi-solid-state batteries way back in 2022. At that time, the automaker installed semi-solid-state batteries in 50 prototype E70 electric sedans. The pack was developed in collaboration with battery company Ganfeng, and also supports swapping, local media said at the time.

In August, the automaker said the commercial production of the semi-solid-state battery would begin in 2026. And it would deliver a range of over 620 miles.

Dodge Charger Daytona EV (Demo EV)

Battery type: Semi-solid state

Energy Density: 375 Wh/kg

Supplier: Factorial Energy

Stellantis and Massachusetts-based battery startup Factorial have validated a semi-solid-state battery cell with a claimed energy density of 375 watt hours per kilogram, which is more than the typical 200-300 Wh/kg energy density of traditional lithium-ion batteries. The automaker claims the cells can charge from 15-90% in 18 minutes at room temperature. It has a discharge rate of up to 4C, meaning it can fully discharge four times in an hour. The battery will be tested on a demo fleet of Charger Daytona EVs next year, Stellantis has said.

Mercedes-Benz EQS (Demo EV)

Battery type: Semi-solid state

Supplier: Factorial Energy

Range: 620 miles (WLTP)

Factorial is also supplying semi-solid-state batteries to Mercedes-Benz. Earlier this year, the automaker showcased a prototype EQS equipped with Factorial’s semi-solid-state battery, claiming it could deliver 25% more range without increasing the size or the weight of the pack. The current EQS has a battery capacity of roughly 118 kWh. Factorial expects mass production to begin by the end of the decade.

BMW i7 (Demo EV)

Photo by: BMW

Battery type: All-solid state

Energy Density: 390 Wh/kg

Supplier: Solid Power

BMW started testing a prototype i7 powered by all-solid-state cells in Munich this summer. It’s using prismatic cells developed by Colorado-based battery start-up Solid Power. The automaker didn’t share the size of the pack, but said it would begin making the cells on a pilot production line in Germany by licensing Solid Power’s technology. Crucial information such as estimated range is missing, but it’s probably too early for that.

Automakers With Plans To Launch Solid-State Batteries

Toyota

2019 Toyota LQ concept

Toyota put a solid-state battery in the futuristic-looking LQ prototype way back in 2021, way before the technology started making weekly news headlines. It expects its first solid-state battery to enter mass production in the 2027-2028 period.

The automaker claims that its solid-state battery will deliver more than 620 miles of range. And it could charge from 10-80% in less than 10 minutes. However, we’re likely to see a solid-state battery in a Toyota hybrid before an EV. Gill Pratt, Toyota’s chief scientist and head of the Toyota Research Institute, confirmed that in 2022.

That makes perfect sense. Toyota hybrids are as popular as ever, and if the RAV4 or Prius can double their electric-only driving range, it’s a win for the brand and also for the climate.

Honda

Honda is working independently to develop an all-solid-state battery, which it intends to install in production vehicles sometime in the second half of this decade. The automaker said last year that its solid-state cells could potentially be 50% smaller, 35% lighter and 25% cheaper than current lithium-ion batteries.

It expects a driving range exceeding 620 miles, which could increase to over 700 miles over time. It’s currently testing the battery on a pilot production line in Japan, ironing out issues related to mass production.

Volkswagen

QuantumScape Battery Prototype

The Volkswagen Group is working closely with California-based battery startup QuantumScape to develop all-solid-state batteries. Its battery subsidiary PowerCo has invested upwards of $260 million into QuantumScape, with a recent funding round going towards a pilot production line for the cells.

QuantumScape has said that today’s EVs with 350 miles of range could achieve between 400 and 500 miles of range using its anode-free lithium metal batteries. However, that number could vary substantially depending on the pack size and the application.

Nissan

Nissan is not in good shape, with its profits tanking and sales falling off a cliff. But it’s not giving up in the race to develop next-generation battery cells. Like Toyota and Honda, Nissan is also working on solid-state batteries in-house. Executives from the company even told InsideEVs in April that they’re planning commercialization by the end of fiscal year 2028.

The automaker’s all-solid-state cells will use a sulphur-based electrolyte and maybe even a sulphur-manganese cathode, which could allow it to eliminate cobalt entirely. Cobalt—a byproduct of copper—requires dirty and expensive mining and is linked to labor violations in Congo.

BYD

BYD said this year that it was working on solid-state batteries, but denied rumors of the popular Seal sedan benefitting from the tech. The automaker said that it expects to begin demonstrations starting in 2027, with mass production expected after 2030, but stopped short of sharing which EV exactly it will use for testing.

Hyundai-Kia

Hyundai is probably among the most cautious when it comes to solid-state batteries. While the automaker still appears to be working on the tech behind-the-scenes, senior Hyundai officials have said that they won't be able to commercialize the cells before 2030. The Japanese automakers by comparison seem to have more aggressive timelines for bringing these batteries to market.

It’s worth noting that today’s dominant chemistries such as nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) and lithium iron phosphate (LFP) are steadily improving. Gains in performance, coupled with established supply chains and the falling cost of lithium, could delay the need for solid-state cells or make their business case harder to justify.

Still, we’re keeping a close eye on the battery market and will update this list as new developments arise.

As the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposes record-high Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs) for 2026 and 2027, stakeholders are grappling with the dual challenges of small refinery exemptions (SREs) and the geopolitical dynamics of biofuel trade. For investors, this debate represents both a high-stakes policy gamble and a potential inflection point for domestic renewable energy infrastructure.

The RFS Reallocation Landscape: Policy Shifts and Market Signals

The EPA’s proposed RVOs for 2026 and 2027—24.02 billion gallons (bg) and 24.46 bg, respectively—mark a 9.5% increase from 2025 levels, with a clear tilt toward domestic production [1]. Notably, the agency has introduced a 50% devaluation of Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) for imported biofuels and foreign-sourced feedstocks, a move explicitly designed to bolster U.S. corn ethanol and biomass-based diesel (BBD) producers [2]. This policy shift aligns with the Renewable Fuels Association’s (RFA) advocacy for “prioritizing domestic renewable fuels over imports,” which it argues will stabilize markets and support rural economies [3].

However, the reallocation of SREs remains a contentious wildcard. As of August 2025, the EPA has granted exemptions to 175 small refineries across multiple compliance years, with 13 petitions still pending [4]. While the agency has committed to reallocating these volumes to maintain RVO integrity, industry groups like the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association warn that delays or inconsistent enforcement could create a “2-billion-gallon uncertainty” in the market [5]. This uncertainty is already manifesting in RIN price volatility: D4 (BBD) credits recently traded between $0.84 and $0.89 per RIN, while D6 (conventional ethanol) credits hovered near $0.80–$0.82 [6].

Investment Opportunities: Domestic Biofuels and Agricultural Synergies

The EPA’s policy recalibration is creating clear tailwinds for U.S. biofuel producers and agricultural stakeholders. The proposed RVOs are expected to drive demand for corn and soybeans, with Darling Ingredients noting that the devaluation of imported feedstocks could boost soybean oil demand by 1.5 billion gallons annually [7]. This has already spurred capital investment in soybean crush capacity, with five new plants operational in 2024 and more under construction [7].

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) further amplifies these opportunities. Section 45X tax credits for clean manufacturing have drawn $115 billion in U.S. clean energy investments since 2022, with biofuels and hydrogen production emerging as key beneficiaries [8]. For instance, biomass-based diesel producers stand to gain from the IRA’s 45V tax credit, which offers up to $1.29 per gallon for low-carbon fuels [9]. Similarly, the proposed 5.61 bg BBD mandate for 2026 could catalyze infrastructure upgrades at existing refineries, particularly in the Midwest [1].

Risks on the Horizon: SREs, Imports, and Market Fragmentation

Despite these opportunities, investors must navigate significant risks. The SRE backlog and reallocation process remain a source of regulatory ambiguity. Clean Fuels Alliance America has warned that delayed RVO finalization could disrupt compliance planning for 2026, while the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers argue that reallocating exempted volumes risks “increasing imports and undermining U.S. energy dominance” [10].

Geopolitical tensions also loom large. Brazil’s recent trade barriers against U.S. ethanol exports—coupled with the EPA’s import devaluation policy—threaten to fragment global markets and reduce price competitiveness for U.S. biofuels [3]. Meanwhile, the elimination of eRINs (electricity from biogas) under the “Set 2” rule has shifted focus back to liquid biofuels, potentially slowing innovation in emerging sectors like sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) [2].

Strategic Considerations for Investors

For investors, the RFS reallocation debate underscores the importance of hedging against policy volatility while capitalizing on structural trends. Key strategies include:

1. Diversifying Exposure: Balancing investments in conventional biofuels (e.g., corn ethanol) with advanced categories (e.g., BBD, cellulosic biofuels) to mitigate SRE-related risks.

2. Leveraging IRA Incentives: Targeting projects aligned with 45X and 45V tax credits, particularly in soybean oil processing and biomass-based diesel upscaling.

3. Monitoring RIN Markets: Closely tracking RIN price movements as a barometer of RVO enforcement and SRE reallocation progress.

Conclusion

The RFS reallocation debate is a microcosm of broader tensions in U.S. energy policy: the push-pull between domestic production and global trade, regulatory certainty and political expediency, and short-term compliance costs versus long-term decarbonization goals. For investors, the path forward lies in navigating these complexities with a dual focus on policy agility and market fundamentals. As the EPA moves toward finalizing its 2026–2027 RVOs by October 2025, the coming months will test whether the RFS can evolve into a stable, scalable framework—or remain a source of market fragmentation.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-07 12:08:28.528845

Conclusion: Navigating the Storm Mexico's energy and trade sectors are at a crossroads.","The U.S.-Mexico relationship in 2025 is a volatile chessboard of tariffs, political brinkmanship, and energy sector recalibration. For investors, the stakes are high as U.S. policy shifts—ranging from Trump-era tariff hikes to judicially driven regulatory uncertainty in Mexico—reshape the calculus of nearshoring and energy investments. This article dissects the risks and opportunities in Mexico's energy and manufacturing sectors, offering a roadmap for navigating the turbulence.

The Tariff Tightrope: U.S. Policy as a Double-Edged Sword

The U.S. has weaponized trade policy to address non-economic issues, with tariffs on Mexican steel, aluminum, , respectively. These measures, framed as responses to fentanyl and immigration concerns, have created a ""shadow tax"" on Mexican exports. For context, . content threshold under USMCA. This creates a paradox: while U.S. manufacturers benefit from lower effective tariffs, foreign automakers (e.g., Kia, Nissan) struggle to compete, potentially diverting investment to U.S. or Asian hubs.

The Trump administration's 90-day tariff suspension in July 2025 offered a temporary reprieve, but the underlying instability persists. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum's efforts to negotiate a new trade agreement are hampered by U.S. demands to curb Chinese transshipment and limit non-USMCA compliance. For investors, this means hedging against sudden policy pivots, particularly in sectors like steel and automotive manufacturing.

Energy Sector Paralysis: Policy Uncertainty vs. Decarbonization Needs

Mexico's energy sector is caught between its decarbonization goals and the U.S.-driven regulatory fog. The Sheinbaum administration's constitutional reforms, which redefined state-owned energy giants CFE and Pemex as ""state-preferred"" entities, have spooked private investors. These reforms, coupled with the elimination of independent regulatory agencies, have eroded confidence in Mexico's ability to enforce contracts or resolve disputes—a critical concern for capital-intensive energy projects.

Meanwhile, U.S. energy policies are compounding the challenge. The ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" (OBBBA) has accelerated timelines for Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credits, forcing developers to meet 2026-2027 deadlines for solar, wind, and battery projects. Mexico's energy infrastructure, , now faces a dual threat: U.S. tariff-driven supply chain disruptions and domestic policy unpredictability.

The irony is stark: Mexico's geographic and labor advantages make it an ideal nearshoring destination for clean energy manufacturing, yet U.S. tariffs on critical components (e.g., transformers, semiconductors) and Mexico's own regulatory overhauls are stifling growth. For instance, the 50% U.S. tariffs on Mexican copper—a key material for EVs and renewable projects—threaten to derail decarbonization synergies between the two nations.

Nearshoring Opportunities: A Fragile Window

Despite the headwinds, nearshoring remains a compelling opportunity for Mexico. The country's 12 free trade agreements, including USMCA, provide a framework for attracting foreign direct investment (FDI). However, the Sheinbaum administration's judicial reforms—popularly elected judges and weakened oversight—have dampened investor appetite. In Q1 2025, , a stark decline from historical averages.

The automotive sector offers a glimmer of hope. , . While this challenges Mexican automakers, it also creates a niche for U.S. firms seeking to outsource production to Mexico's lower-cost, high-skilled labor force. Investors should monitor how U.S. .

Strategic Recommendations for Investors

Hedge Against Political Risk: Prioritize investments in sectors less sensitive to U.S. tariffs, such as Mexico's renewable energy storage or hydrogen projects. These align with global decarbonization trends and are less exposed to trade policy swings.

Leverage USMCA Compliance: Target Mexican manufacturers that can meet the 40% U.S. content threshold, reducing effective tariff rates. This is particularly relevant for automotive and battery supply chains.

Diversify Trade Partnerships: Mexico's negotiations with the EU and Brazil to update trade agreements could offset U.S. volatility. Investors should consider portfolios that span multiple trade corridors.

Monitor 2026 USMCA Renegotiations: The Trump administration's push to renegotiate USMCA in 2026 could either stabilize or further destabilize the investment climate. Positioning for potential tariff reductions on steel and autos could yield long-term gains.

Conclusion: Navigating the Storm

Mexico's energy and trade sectors are at a crossroads. While the country's strategic location and labor advantages make it a nearshoring magnet, U.S. policy shifts and domestic reforms are creating a minefield of risks. For investors, the key lies in balancing short-term caution with long-term optimism—capitalizing on nearshoring opportunities while hedging against political and regulatory volatility. As the 2026 USMCA review looms, the next 12 months will be critical in determining whether Mexico can stabilize its investment climate or become a casualty of U.S. geopolitical maneuvering.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-07 11:01:40.761890

The electric vehicle (EV) market is experiencing turbulent times, especially in the aftermath of policy shifts following the previous U.S. presidential administration. Initiatives aimed at bolstering EV adoption, such as emissions regulations, tax credits, and funding for charging infrastructure, have faced significant rollbacks. These developments have contributed to a perception among certain sectors that the push for EVs is misguided, branding it as part of a “green new scam.” This sentiment has not only affected domestic manufacturers but has also created challenges for foreign automakers operating in the U.S. market.

A notable casualty of this shift is Volkswagen, which recently announced the furlough of 160 employees at its ID.4 factory in Chattanooga, Tennessee, citing declining demand for the model. While a surge in EV sales is anticipated before a federal tax incentive deadline at the end of September, the longer-term outlook remains grim, raising concerns about consumer interest in electric vehicles in the future.

In a parallel development, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has reversed a previously established mandate that required automakers to meet specific EV sales targets. This decision comes amidst ongoing trade tensions and is intended to provide relief to domestic manufacturers grappling with the fallout from U.S. tariff policies. Initially, the Trudeau administration aimed for a goal of 20 percent electric vehicle sales by 2026, escalating to 100 percent by 2035. Industry experts criticized the plan as unrealistic, arguing it was not grounded in a thorough analysis of market conditions.

As manufacturers grapple with these shifting dynamics, a company named Horse Powertrain is putting forth a novel solution aimed at easing “range anxiety” among potential EV buyers. This joint venture between Renault and Geely has developed a compact engine and generator that can be retrofitted to existing battery electric vehicles (BEVs). Set to be showcased at the upcoming IAA auto show in Munich, Horse Powertrain’s C15 engine is marketed as small enough to fit within a briefcase, though its actual dimensions suggest it is slightly larger.

Horse Powertrain’s approach enables manufacturers to convert BEV platforms into range-extended electric vehicles (REEVs) without extensive modifications. This innovation aims to capitalize on the increasing demand for REEVs in various global markets. The C15 engine is designed to comply with stringent emissions regulations and can run on a range of fuels, including gasoline, ethanol, and synthetic fuels. Importantly, it functions to maintain the battery’s charge rather than directly powering the vehicle, optimizing efficiency and minimizing fuel consumption.

Industry observers note that Horse Powertrain’s emergence at this juncture may reflect a broader reckoning within the automotive sector, as both governments and manufacturers reassess their commitments to purely electric vehicles. While many have long championed the all-electric future, the hesitation observed in consumer interest signals that more diverse powertrain solutions, such as hybrids, may become increasingly relevant.

As ongoing debates about the future of transportation technology continue, the need for affordability looms large. Currently, the higher price points of EVs compared to traditional vehicles remain a substantial barrier to widespread adoption. Until these concerns are addressed, the trajectory of the EV revolution may remain uncertain, with manufacturers needing to adapt swiftly to evolving consumer preferences and regulatory landscapes.",https://news.ssbcrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/EV-Market-Faces-Setbacks-as-Canada-Rescinds-Mandate-and-US.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 12:06:34.328148

Real Clear Wire

The most disturbing thing about the nationwide rise in electricity prices is that the average consumer is footing the bill for the biggest power users – huge data centers for artificial intelligence.

Electricity prices could jump 15% to 40% in just the next 5 years, according to a recent forecast. And prices have already begun to jump. Retail electric prices have increased faster than the rate of inflation since 2022 – rising 13%.

Make no mistake, high electricity prices are now America's most pressing energy problem, affecting everybody, from the ordinary citizen to the huge corporation.

Ohio is part of the PJM Interconnection, a 13-state regional grid operator, the largest in the nation. Shortages in the supply of electricity – and even higher power prices – may affect PJM and the neighboring MISO grid in the Midwest sooner than other regions of the country. Both grids are staring down rapidly approaching capacity shortfalls.

Our electric power usage for AI data centers, electrification and industrialization is growing rapidly and supply is struggling to keep up. Some utilities in the Midwest have encountered demand levels they did not project for a decade. And we’re learning in real time the evolving mix of resources on the grid is proving ill-equipped for periods of peak demand.

During a recent heatwave, the MISO grid, which at times gets 25 GW of wind power – enough for 15 million homes – got just 1 GW of wind generation when power demand was its highest. Brutal heat and no wind left ten-of-billions of dollars in wind investments hulking statues. It was the coal and natural gas fleets that once again came to the rescue.

Our supply of power has almost no margin for error. And the situation is growing more challenging. While rising power prices are a signal to bring new generating capacity to the market, demand is growing faster than our ability to meet it.

New power plants and energy infrastructure – like pipelines and transmission lines -take years of planning and development before they can be connected to the grid. New data centers, on the other hand, with the power needs of entire cities or state are going from the drawing board to operational in a matter of months.

Ohio is already home to 172 data centers, the fourth largest total in the nation. But the next generation of data centers developed to serve the needs of AI dwarf these existing facilities. Consider the data centers tech giant Meta is building, including in Ohio. Just one of these data centers – scheduled to begin service next year – will have the power needs of the entire state of Nevada.

While policymakers are grappling with the challenge presented by the AI boom, and trying to regulate the impact these data centers will have on power markets, the onus must be on tech companies to step up.

Tech giants are placing orders for their own natural gas facilities and are even contracting to bring next generation nuclear power plants to the grid. While helpful, these are solutions for tomorrow while the impact on consumers is already biting today.

What tech companies have not done – at least so far – is embrace the existing coal fleet. It’s a glaring mistake.

Despite soaring electricity demand, many existing coal plants are scheduled to close early—a response to years of state and federal regulatory pressure. Losing these plants is simply incompatible with this moment.

Tech giants have the resources to ensure these facilities not only aren’t pushed off the grid but can be used far more efficiently to meet rising demand.

Addressing soaring electricity prices is going to take creative solutions. And the companies driving the surge must lead the way.

Consumers deserve reliable and affordable electricity, and the knowledge the corporations driving the surge in power prices are doing all they can to confront it.

President of the United States Donald Trump signed The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), a move that substantially alters the nation's energy investment and supply chain landscape, as detailed in a report by Rystad Energy. The legislation reverses key elements of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), shortening tax credit timelines for renewable energy while extending support for biofuels and fossil fuels.

The act accelerates the expiration of tax credits for wind, solar, and clean hydrogen projects. Solar and wind facilities must now begin construction within 12 months and be operational by the end of 2027, a significant contraction from the previous 2032 deadline. This compressed timeline is expected to trigger a rush among developers to secure project materials and qualify for incentives before the window closes.

New domestic content and foreign entity restrictions are central to the OBBBA's changes. To qualify for tax credits, projects must meet escalating sourcing thresholds for components, which top out at 90% for some equipment. Data from the IndexBox platform indicates these rules will necessitate a rapid and costly restructuring of clean energy manufacturing supply chains to prioritize domestic or ally-sourced materials.

The legislation introduces benefits for the oil and gas sector, particularly for companies operating on federal lands. A reduction in federal royalty rates and the reinstatement of 100% bonus depreciation for capital expenditures are projected to lower breakeven prices for new production by one to two dollars per barrel in most core US shale plays.

The OBBBA's provisions are projected to reshape global energy trade flows, creating advantages for North American biofuel feedstocks and disadvantaging foreign entities. The policy shift moves the US toward a strategy emphasizing domestic energy security and traditional fuels, altering the competitive environment for global clean technology investment.",https://www.indexbox.io/landing/img/Default.webp,N,,2025-09-07 11:01:47.567383

The key is on the Atlantic Ocean wind that will be captured by 176 wind turbines installed offshore, around 38 km from the Virginia Beach coast. Each of these turbines will be about 100 meters high and it will take advantage of the wind’s strength that constantly blows in the open sea, to generate free polluting emissions energy. So, let’s learn more about this interesting project that could benefit the environment.

Clean energy

The aim of this project is to produce 2,600 megawatts of electricity, which is 2,600,000 kilowatts. To have a clear picture of what this means, we could say that this amount of energy could keep lights, home appliances, and electric devices on thousands of families in the entire state of Virginia.

Apart from its environmental contribution, this project is going to have a huge impact on Virginia’s energy independence. I mean it will lower its dependence on power plants that work with coal, gas or petroleum. Less pollution for our planet, hurray!

Local economy

The Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project will also improve the economy of the region. During the construction, more than 1,000 jobs will be created and once the wind farm starts functioning, those jobs will continue being useful for operations and maintenance.

It is estimated that the economic impact will be hundreds of millions of dollars per year for Virginia. Also, it is expected the state will save about $3,000 millions in fuel costs for the first 10 years of the wind farm functioning.

Day and night energy

One of the positive things about offshore wind turbines is that they can generate electricity day and night, as long as there’s wind. In the open sea, the wind is more constant and stronger than in solid ground.

The project is also taking measures to protect marine life. During the process of the turbines installation, some special protocols have been implemented to minimize the impact on whales, dolphins, fish, and other species that live in nearby Virginia Beach.

Virginia’s energy future

This offshore wind farm wasn’t thought of as an isolated project, it is part of a wider strategy to transform Virginia into a clean energy leader in the U.S. The project shows evidence that the Atlantic Ocean can be a great source of renewable energy, and that investing in green technology is both beneficial for the planet and the local economy. So, everybody wins!

The CVOW joins other efforts of the country to diversify its sources of energy, reducing dependency on fossil fuels and strengthening energy safety. Now Virginia will have its own stable clean energy source.

What’s coming next?

The wind farm is expected to have the 176 turbines completely installed and functioning by 2026. However, the project has already started being built in 2023. Once this is finished, the energy will go through underwater cables toward the regional electric network (how crazy, right?). So, many homes and companies in Virginia will directly benefit from it. This project is a turning point in the way energy is produced in the state of Virginia, but also it will be a great example for other similar projects in the U.S. and around the world.",https://eladelantado.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/virginia-offshore-wind-turbines-clean-energy.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 08:01:10.869675

This launch will transform everything we know about automotive sustainability, demonstrating that electric cars may not be the only solution for a cleaner future. Discover the German giant behind this project and what we can expect from this incredible synthetic fuel.

The secret project from a German company

The automotive industry has been increasingly seeking more sustainable solutions for its vehicles. The old ways of generating energy and producing fuel are no longer acceptable due to the alarming increase in greenhouse gas emissions, which are very harmful to the environment. With new regulations to reduce the carbon footprint within the automotive sector, companies are investing in more sustainable and clear fuel manufacturing technologies.

With this in mind, a renowned German company has decided to invest in a secret project, envisioning a cleaner future for the automotive sector. The company aims to become a pioneer with this unexpected and innovative new launch: the company is working on a hydrogen fuel cell and a super-tech car with 2,000-kilometer range, to accommodate this hydrogen fuel cell pill. The company behind this new and green project is Volkswagen, one of the leading players in the automotive market.

The model hasn’t been officially launched yet, but when it hits the market, it will be Volkswagen’s first hydrogen fuel cell vehicle. This project is being manufactured in partnership with another German company, Kraftwerk Tubes, and the two are preparing to pioneer this new market that’s opening up in the automotive industry: the search for clean energy options beyond the more common electric cars.

Will Volkswagen abandon the manufacture of electric cars?

Despite Volkswagen’s decision to invest in this synthetic fuel project, the company assures that it will not be completely abandoning the development of electric vehicles. The model has seen a decline in production and growth — fell by about 15% and 40% in Europe —, not only at the German company but globally. This is related to several issues, such as the electric motor manufacturing process and the cost involved. These are precisely the reason that led Volkswagen to invest in other models.

Electric cars are known for commanding high market prices. Both their production and sales are quite expensive, and maintaining such a car ends up being costly and unaffordable for most people worldwide. With this in mind, Volkswagen is interested in connecting with this audience by offering its new hydrogen fuel cell car and another model, which will be electric but aims to be more affordable.

Volkswagen is already the leader in electric car sales in German — even surpassing the famous Tesla. Now, by adopting this new stance of maintaining more affordable prices for electric cars, the brand hopes to counter the prices of Chinese models, which are responsible for the decline in sales figures for European companies. With the cell of these two new projects, Volkswagen has everything it needs to leads the automotive industry into the future of the energy transition.

The future of the automotive industry has more than one option

As mentioned earlier, this Volkswagen project has not yet been officially launched; hydrogen fuel cell technologies is still in the conceptual stage. But there is undoubtedly a lot of anticipation.

This technology is expected to be more productive and affordable than current market trend, and hydrogen is considered the fuel of the future. After the company’s patent filling for this project, we hope to see other companies in the sector invest in this technology, moving towards an energy transition.

Forecasts suggest that by 2026, 10 million more people in Ethiopia will have access to electricity.
The Burden of Limited Electricity Access Ethiopia is one of the most populous countries in sub-Saharan Africa, with more than 100 million people.
The country is experiencing rapid population growth, which has contributed to challenges such as food insecurity, environmental strain and low electricity access.
Looking Ahead Access to electricity in Ethiopia has risen to 55.4% and continues to grow rapidly.","The continent of Africa has one of the lowest electricity access rates in the world, making life more difficult for millions of people. Africa is home to 19% of the world’s population, yet many—mostly in sub-Saharan Africa—are living without electricity. Those who do have access often rely on power sources that are unreliable and unsustainable. Electricity demand has continued to grow over time, especially in Ethiopia, but the World Bank has been making moves to change that.

The ELEAP Program

The Ethiopia Electrification Program (ELEAP) is under the leadership of the World Bank Group. Its main goal is to reach complete electrification in Ethiopia by the end of 2025 and to support the rollout of new electrification systems. The plan is to expand electricity through solar mini-grids, with some grid (65%) and some off-grid (35%) energy systems.

So far, the results have been positive. As of 2025, the program has made strong progress. From March 1, 2018, to June 4, 2024, 6.3 million people gained access to on-grid electricity sources. Solar energy is the most viable option for renewable energy and the most reliable source, as it has already been a major part of Ethiopia’s electrical landscape. The implementation of solar energy fits easily with the systems already in place, which allows them to work together effectively. Because of these systems, more than 19,000 public facilities have gained access to electricity, including health clinics and schools. Forecasts suggest that by 2026, 10 million more people in Ethiopia will have access to electricity.

The Burden of Limited Electricity Access

Ethiopia is one of the most populous countries in sub-Saharan Africa, with more than 100 million people. The country is experiencing rapid population growth, which has contributed to challenges such as food insecurity, environmental strain and low electricity access. Even though Ethiopia has substantial renewable energy resources, most of the population still relies on traditional biomass energy such as firewood and coal.

Even when households have access to power, financial constraints often prevent them from using it. Most electricity needs are for cooking, but the existing systems are not large-scale enough to provide the energy required for all Ethiopians to prepare their meals. As electricity reaches more areas, household chores have become easier since many families can now use electric stoves instead of fire-burning stoves, saving time and benefiting the environment. Solar-powered water pumps have also been introduced to provide clean water to rural communities.

Before the introduction of new energy systems, women and children had to go outside and search for wood to use as fuel and poor households had to devote all their income to energy. With expanded access, energy is now reaching both large infrastructure projects and poor urban communities.

Looking Ahead

Access to electricity in Ethiopia has risen to 55.4% and continues to grow rapidly. ELEAP has made significant progress in electrifying the country within just a few years. The outlook for Ethiopia and ELEAP remains positive, with sustainable energy sources supporting growth and improving the lives of many.

Now 20 years since Hurricane Katrina, we stand together as those who not just refuse to be silenced but who demand and reimagine anew.","“WE HAVE THE BODY BAGS READY.”

Though it was more than 25 years ago, I still feel the chill that ran through my body in a conference room in the wetlands of Northern California. I was a graduate student on a multi-university, interdisciplinary wetland restoration project team. We, a group of scientists from the south and west, had convened near one of our research sites, and a prominent plant biologist from Louisiana who spent her career researching the wetlands of New Orleans was presenting her work. It was four years prior to the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, when we were naïve to the harsh reality that the government, at all levels, could and would devastatingly fail the most vulnerable Americans during an unprecedented natural disaster, leaving human tragedy in its wake.

Recall that in New Orleans, in the face of the catastrophic hurricane assigned the name Katrina, it was the levee system that did not hold, that burst sending water gushing back into the Lower Ninth Ward and other impoverished areas. Our project team was exploring what happens to wetland ecosystems when levee systems like the one that broke (i.e., an elevated humanmade barrier or embankment constructed to stop the natural flow of water often to create dry developable land) breach naturally over time. During her presentation, four years before Katrina, the plant biologist said she knew with certainty that if a massive storm hit, the levee systems in New Orleans would not hold. Four years prior to Katrina, she urgently shared this information with government officials, warning them of the imminent threat particularly to poor, elderly, and Black residents if the levee system broke. But instead of taking action to bolster the failing system, she was told: “We have the body bags ready.”

Warnings ignored before the storm

What have we learned in the 20 years since Hurricane Katrina? Twenty years after the dehumanization of the Superdome, the false and racialized narratives conflating looting with survival, the gutting helicopter footage of primarily poor and Black Americans seeking refuge on sinking rooftops, the government, at local, state, and federal levels collectively left the most vulnerable communities to drown and then fight for their lives on their own.

Surely, we’ve made advances since 2005 to increase disaster response. We certainly have. Yet it’s difficult to see that progress as the current federal administration systematically dismantles the upstanding science agencies designed to keep Americans safe. Innovations that include: advances in extreme weather modeling and forecasting, efficient warning systems, effective evacuation mechanisms, comprehensive disaster recovery plans and strategies. For example, the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), an agency foundational to our knowledge and understanding of extreme weather events has been decimated and the experts that created and perfected hurricane modeling and tracking have been fired. Likewise, it is the knowledge of experts at the National Weather Service (also part of NOAA) used to issue timely severe weather watches and warnings. Further, these lifesaving warnings and evacuation orders, that allow people time to plan and escape are being silenced.

Just this summer Congress unconscionably voted to cancel funding for the Center for Public Broadcasting which supports the very public radio that broadcasts critical extreme weather information to impacted areas, especially in rural regions that may not have access to other information sources. Finally, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), designed to help Americans navigate unexpected disasters that leave their lives in disarray was merged with the Department of Homeland Security and lacks leadership and expertise. We saw the consequences of these unconscionable elimination decisions that allowed incompetence and dysfunction to lead the response in Texas during the floods that took too many lives; urgent calls unanswered, critical funding inaccessible, emergency warning systems failed. The slice of human tragedy we witnessed in Texas is a warning of what is to come on much larger scales as climate change increases the likelihood and severity of extreme weather events. We must act now.

Reimagine, resist, stand together

What can we do? How do we maintain hope and possibility as publicly available climate data and tools are erased from federal websites, limiting the ability to make evidence-based decisions? As agencies like the National Science Foundation terminate grants that engage in climate science research because they “no longer effectuate agency priorities;” an experience I know too well, having lost my NSF Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) award that supports science teachers and students as community-based climate action researchers.

What we do is we reimagine, we resist, we collectively stand up. For inspiration, I look to sources of bravery and determination in and outside of science including: Data scientists saving and archiving tools that the government has tried to erase, scientists at the National Institutes of Health and on, issuing powerful statements of ethics and solidarity; persistent Americans, especially in red states, who attend town halls demanding that politicians answer to them, their constituents; residents of Los Angeles peacefully marching in solidarity with their immigrant neighbors and in defiance of a president who they will not allow to mischaracterize them; artists who reject the attempted erasure of their creativity because U.S. history and politics, in its truth telling, isn’t supposed to be comfortable.

As a professor I see the young people across this nation fighting to be heard, demanding the future they desire and envisioning it into being. We must stand up for science because science can be used to keep us all safe, especially the most vulnerable among us. Now 20 years since Hurricane Katrina, we stand together as those who not just refuse to be silenced but who demand and reimagine anew.

The federal government’s decision to pause the 2026 target of requiring 20% zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) sales—originally set under Justin Trudeau—reflects a shift toward prioritizing industry competitiveness amid U.S. trade pressures. While this move has been welcomed by automakers like General Motors and Ford as a reprieve from unrealistic mandates, it raises critical questions about the sustainability of Canada’s climate goals and the resilience of its EV supply chain in a volatile trade environment.

Short-Term Relief: Industry Flexibility and Tariff Mitigation

The pause of the 2026 EV mandate, announced by Prime Minister Mark Carney, is part of a broader strategy to alleviate financial strain on the auto sector caused by U.S. tariffs. These tariffs, including a 25% duty on non-U.S. vehicle imports and additional levies on steel and aluminum, have disrupted supply chains and forced automakers to reevaluate production strategies [1]. By removing the 2026 sales target, the government aims to provide automakers with greater flexibility to adjust to market realities. GM Canada’s president, Kristian Aquilina, praised the decision, arguing that EV adoption should align with consumer demand rather than government-imposed timelines [2].

The pause also coincides with the temporary resumption of the iZEV Program’s claims portal, allowing dealerships to submit unprocessed rebates for eligible vehicles. However, the program remains paused for new incentives, leaving consumers without financial support for EV purchases [3]. This gap in consumer incentives could slow adoption rates, particularly as EV prices rise due to tariffs and supply chain costs.

U.S. Tariffs and Supply Chain Reconfiguration

The U.S. trade war has amplified the challenges for North American automakers. Trump’s tariffs on Chinese EVs and non-U.S. auto parts have forced companies to localize production and rethink sourcing strategies. For example, Honda delayed its $15 billion EV production hub in Ontario, citing tariffs and slower market demand as key factors [4]. Similarly, General Motors has prioritized localized battery production to reduce costs and mitigate trade risks, aiming to cut battery cell costs by $30 per kilowatt hour in 2025 [5].

The Canadian government’s $5 billion aid package for firms affected by tariffs further underscores the urgency of reshoring efforts. However, this support does not extend to the steel and aluminum industries, which have been disproportionately impacted by U.S. levies [6]. This uneven relief highlights the fragility of Canada’s industrial strategy in a trade environment increasingly shaped by protectionism.

Long-Term Risks: Climate Goals and Market Uncertainty

While the 2026 pause offers short-term relief, it introduces long-term risks for Canada’s climate commitments. Environmental advocates warn that delaying EV targets could undermine efforts to increase supply and lower prices for consumers [7]. The 2030 and 2035 goals of achieving 60% and 100% ZEV sales, respectively, remain intact, but the absence of a 2026 benchmark may erode momentum. Provinces like British Columbia have maintained their EV mandates, creating a patchwork of regulations that complicate national coordination [8].

Financial analysts also caution that policy uncertainty could deter private investment in EV infrastructure. The Parliamentary Budget Officer’s analysis of production subsidies for Stellantis-LGES and Volkswagen highlights geographic and economic risks in scaling the EV supply chain [9]. Meanwhile, the Bank of Canada’s assessment of weak productivity growth underscores broader challenges in reallocating capital to support electrification [10].

Strategic Adjustments and Investment Trends

North American automakers are adapting to these dynamics by shifting R&D and capital toward localized battery production and nearshoring. Ford and GM have announced significant investments in U.S. and Canadian plants to meet USMCA compliance and reduce reliance on foreign components [11]. However, the absence of federal rebates and the potential influx of cheaper Chinese EVs into Canada threaten to erode market share for domestic producers [12].

The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act’s (IRA) recent rollback of EV tax credits further complicates the investment outlook. This policy reversal could reduce consumer demand and slow the pace of electrification, particularly in cross-border markets where Canadian automakers compete with U.S. and Chinese rivals [13].

Conclusion: Balancing Competitiveness and Climate Objectives

Canada’s EV policy pivot reflects a pragmatic response to immediate economic pressures but risks undermining long-term climate and industrial goals. While the pause provides automakers with short-term flexibility, it also exposes the sector to heightened trade volatility and reduced consumer incentives. For North American automakers and suppliers, the path forward requires a delicate balance between aligning with regulatory shifts and maintaining commitments to decarbonization. As the 60-day review of the EV Availability Standard (EVAS) unfolds, stakeholders must advocate for policies that harmonize climate ambitions with market realities—ensuring that Canada remains a competitive player in the global EV transition.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-07 10:00:53.132519

Türkiye’s upcoming Renewable Energy Resource Zone (YEKA) tenders in November and December are expected to attract about $3.3 billion in investment, allocating 2,000 megawatts (MW) of wind and solar capacity across 12 provinces.

The projects aim to cut reliance on imported energy, expand domestic clean power use and strengthen the country’s renewable manufacturing base.

YEKA, a special tender model, is designed to allocate large-scale wind and solar projects, encourage local manufacturing, and attract foreign and domestic investment.

Six wind projects totaling 1,150 MW will be auctioned in Sivas, Balıkesir, Aydın, Denizli, and Kütahya, with project sizes ranging from 110 MW to 500 MW.

Nine solar projects, ranging from 40 MW to 260 MW, will be tendered in Elazığ, Kahramanmaraş, Erzurum, Bolu, Eskişehir, Mardin, and Van.

Alongside YEKA tenders, Türkiye is also advancing floating solar power projects. In Manisa's Demirkopru Dam reservoir, a 35-megawatt floating solar installation is planned.

To meet its 2035 energy targets, Türkiye recently passed a reform law to streamline permitting and approval processes, aiming to accelerate investments.

The government also plans to strengthen transmission infrastructure with 14,700 kilometers of high-voltage direct current (HVDC) lines totaling 40 gigawatts of capacity.

An additional 15,000 km of alternating current lines will be built, while interconnection capacity is set to reach 6750 MW for exports and 6600 MW for imports.

Alper Kalaycı, the head of Energy Industrialists and Businessmen Association (ENSIA), told state-run Anadolu Agency that wind projects from the tenders are expected to generate about $2.3 billion in investment, while solar projects will account for roughly $1 billion.

These large-scale YEKA projects will particularly benefit companies producing domestic components in the renewable energy sector, he added.

They will also help firms shape their future plans, he explained and added that demand is rising for wind equipment such as turbine blades, towers and generators, as well as for solar panels and other components.

""Localizing production not only boosts demand but also contributes to technological development,"" Kalayci concluded.

Hakan Erkan, secretary-general of the Turkish Solar Energy Industrialists and Industry Association (GENSED), said the 35-megawatt floating solar project planned at the Demirköprü Dam reservoir would attract about $20 million in investment.

Erkan added that floating solar plants help conserve water by reducing evaporation through their shading effect.

Co-published with Inside Climate News and The Texas Tribune

( ProPublica ) – Hakim Dermish moved to the small South Texas town of Catarina in 2002 in search of a rural lifestyle on a budget. The property where he lived with his wife didn’t have electricity or sewer lines at first, but that didn’t bother him.

“Even if we lived in a cardboard box, no one could kick us out,” Dermish said.

Back then, Catarina was a sleepy place. A decade later, oil and gas drilling picked up, and he welcomed the financial opportunities it brought. Dermish launched businesses to support the industry, offering everything from guards for drill sites to housing for oil field workers.

The growth also brought flares — flames burning off excess natural gas — that blazed day and night at wells in the surrounding countryside. Initially enamored of the industry’s potential, Dermish now worried that its pollution endangered the health of the town’s 75 residents. He began lodging complaints with the state in 2023, asking it to push companies to control emissions.

Inspectors with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality investigated, finding only a handful of violations, some of which the companies addressed. But that did little to allay the concerns of Dermish and his neighbors, who continued to see flares light up the sky and to smell gas wafting over the community.

“Starting first thing in the morning, talk about the stench. Then you call the state and nothing happens,” Dermish said. “They do absolutely nothing.”

His neighbor Lupe Campos, who worked in the oil fields for more than three decades, lives three blocks from a flare. Toxic hydrogen sulfide escapes from nearby wells, giving the air the smell of “burnt rotten eggs,” Campos said. “It’s hard to bear.”

While working to expand the nation’s oil and gas production, President Donald Trump’s administration has maintained that drilling in the U.S. is cleaner than in other countries due to tighter environmental oversight. To mark Earth Day, for example, the White House boasted in a statement that increased natural gas exports meant the U.S. would be “sharing cleaner energy with allies” and “reducing global emissions.”

But Texas, the heart of America’s oil and gas industry, tells a different story.

Texas regulators tout their efforts to curtail oil field emissions by requiring drillers to obtain permits to release or burn gas from their wells.

Yet a first-of-its-kind analysis of permit applications to the Railroad Commission of Texas, the state’s main oil and gas regulator, reveals a rubber-stamp system that allows drillers to emit vast amounts of natural gas into the atmosphere. Over 40 months — from May 2021 to September 2024 — oil companies applied for more than 12,000 flaring and venting permits, while the Railroad Commission rejected just 53 of them, a 99.6% approval rate, according to the data.

Natural gas is composed mostly of climate-warming methane but also contains other gases such as hydrogen sulfide, which is deadly at high concentrations. Gas escapes as wells are drilled and before infrastructure is in place to capture it. It also can be intentionally released if pressure in the system poses a safety risk or if capturing and transporting it to be sold is not profitable. Typically, drillers burn the gas they don’t capture, converting the methane to carbon dioxide, a less potent greenhouse gas, in a process called flaring. Sometimes, they release the gas without burning it, in a process called venting.

The permit applications showed oil companies requested to flare or vent more than 195 billion cubic feet of natural gas per year, enough to power more than 3 million homes and generate millions of dollars of tax revenue had the gas been captured. Those emissions would have a climate-warming impact roughly equivalent to 27 gas-fired power plants operating year-round, even if the flares burned every molecule of methane released from the wells.

“It’s a gargantuan amount of emissions,” said Jack McDonald, senior analyst of energy policy and science for the environmental group Oilfield Witness. “Because so much of this gas is methane and so much of it is either incompletely combusted or not combusted at all through the venting process, we see a huge climate impact.”

Oilfield Witness gathered and studied the Railroad Commission data on exemptions to the state’s flaring rules and shared it with ProPublica and Inside Climate News. The news organizations verified the data, including by soliciting input from professors at universities in Texas.

Railroad Commission spokesperson R.J. DeSilva said in a statement that Texas has made “significant progress” in addressing methane emissions. Companies must provide evidence that flaring is necessary, and, when approving permits, the agency follows all applicable rules, he said. “If an application lacks sufficient justification, it is returned with comments for clarification.”

“I am proud of the progress that has been made to reduce the waste of our natural resources,” Jim Wright, chair of the Railroad Commission, said in a statement, adding that “there is always room for further improvement.”

The analysis likely overstates emissions, since the near-guarantee that regulators will approve a permit gives companies an incentive to request authorization for amounts larger than they intend to emit to ensure they’re in compliance. For example, operators in four Texas counties flared about 70% of the volume of gas that their permits allowed, according to a recent effort to compare the state’s flaring data to information collected via satellite. And the Railroad Commission sometimes approves flaring smaller volumes than requested, which is not captured in the data.

“The Texas oil and natural gas industry is committed to ongoing progress in reducing flaring and methane emissions while continuing to meet the ever-growing demand for reliable oil and natural gas across the globe,” Todd Staples, president of the Texas Oil and Gas Association, a trade group, told ProPublica and Inside Climate News in a statement.

Residents of communities surrounded by flares and leaking wells, like Catarina, want the state and the industry to do more to control oil field emissions. The Railroad Commission approved eight flares within 5 miles of the town during the study period and 280 across surrounding Dimmit County, according to agency data.

The danger posed by the gas became impossible to ignore on March 27, as a 30-inch steel pipeline a half-mile from Catarina failed. The rupture blasted more than 23 million cubic feet of gas into the air, as much as is used in 365 homes in a year, according to data the company that owns the pipeline, Energy Transfer, reported to the Railroad Commission.

Dermish recorded the chaos with his cellphone. “The house is shaking,” he says in the video as the escaping gas roars, its concussions jostling the camera.

Fearing for their safety, he and his wife evacuated, heading to a neighboring town for the day. After they returned home that evening, he called the sheriff to ask what had happened. During the conversation, Dermish could feel the gas causing him to slur his words. The next morning, Dermish noticed new gas flares, presumably lit to release pressure in the pipeline network by burning excess gas. A cellphone video he recorded shows a towering column of flame, taller than a nearby telephone pole, billowing and rippling.

“Have you ever seen ‘Lord of the Rings’? Do you remember the Fire of Mordor?” Dermish said in an interview. “That’s what we have here.”

An incident report submitted to the state by Energy Transfer attributed the pipeline failure to a technician’s errors. Without objection from the Railroad Commission, the pipeline was repaired and back in service three days later. The agency did not assess Energy Transfer with a violation or a fine.

Energy Transfer did not respond to a request for comment.

After more than two decades in Catarina, Dermish and his wife are planning to move away. “It’s just too dangerous,” he said.

Is American Oil and Gas Cleaner?

While the Trump administration characterizes American oil and gas as cleaner than fossil fuels from other countries, it has rolled back rules regulating methane.

The Environmental Protection Agency has, under Trump, delayed implementing previously finalized rules that would’ve mandated that the industry monitor for methane leaks and address them. He and Republicans in Congress also repealed the country’s first-ever tax on methane. And in June, Trump revoked a Biden administration guidance document laying out how companies should comply with a law aimed at reducing methane leaks from pipelines.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

As the nation’s highest-producing oil and gas state, Texas is a key barometer of the U.S. regulatory environment and whether it has created a cleaner fossil fuel industry.

The Permian Basin — the country’s largest oil field, which straddles the Texas-New Mexico border — was estimated by a 2024 study to emit the second-most methane of any oil field in the world.

The industry disputes that finding, pointing to a June report from S&P Global Commodity Insights that found that the rate of methane emissions in the Permian Basin dropped 29% between 2023 and 2024. “Methane emissions management” is increasingly a part of the industry’s operations, Raoul LeBlanc, a vice president at S&P, said in a statement announcing the findings. However, S&P’s report acknowledged that satellite data showed a much more modest reduction of 4%, contradicting the company’s own data, which was collected by airplane.

“We can say confidently that there is no evidence that methane emissions from the Permian Basin are low,” said Steven Hamburg, who studies methane as the Environmental Defense Fund’s chief scientist.

Texas’ Attempt to Rein In Flaring

In Texas, State Rule 32 prohibits flaring and venting gas at wells, except under a few specific conditions: while the well is being drilled, during the first 10 days after the well is completed and when necessary to ensure safety. Otherwise, drillers must seek an exception.

The Railroad Commission changed the application process for these exemptions in 2020 and issued new guidance in 2021. Operators would have to explain why they could not suspend drilling to avoid flaring and indicate that they had investigated all options for using the gas before flaring.

Oilfield Witness gathered all exemption requests since 2021, which showed the agency repeatedly approving permits that failed to comply with its guidelines. In many cases, oil companies asked to flare indefinitely or didn’t justify why they needed to flare, leaving blank the section of the application asking why the exemption was needed.

Capturing the gas requires an expensive system of pipelines, compressors and other infrastructure that can cost more than the gas is worth. In their permit applications, companies cite this reality, often listing financial considerations as the reason for seeking exemptions, Oilfield Witness found. These were nearly always approved, even though the agency wrote that finances were an insufficient explanation in a presentation on the permitting process.

“The Railroad Commission seems very interested in devolving decision-making processes to the companies themselves,” McDonald said.

The data also showed that nearly 90% of the approved permit applications were backdated, retroactively giving permission for flares that were already burning. Oil companies typically asked the Railroad Commission for permission to flare 10 days after they had already burned the gas.

A spokesperson said that when the commission revamped its guidelines in 2020, it allowed a longer period in which companies could file for a permit after they’d already started to flare. Even so, nearly 900 of the permits were applied for after the updated filing window and still accepted by the agency.

The Railroad Commission also approved more than 7,000 flares within areas where the gas reservoir being drilled was known to be high in hydrogen sulfide, increasing the likelihood that the toxic gas could escape into the air. Of those flares, 600 were within a mile of a residence, the agency’s data showed.

Minimizing flaring permits is “not a priority in any sense” for the Railroad Commission, said Gunnar Schade, an associate professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University. “The priority is oil produced, and that means revenue for the state. Oil and gas is a priority, so who cares about the flaring?”

Overstating the Progress

The Railroad Commission and the state’s oil industry trumpet their work to reduce flaring. The agency points to state data showing flaring rates dropping dramatically, specifically since 2019. And the Texas Oil and Gas Association announced in early August that drillers in the Permian Basin “slashed methane emission intensity by more than half in just two years.”

But such claims are misleading, according to experts such as David DiCarlo, an associate professor in the University of Texas at Austin’s petroleum engineering school. Using 2019 as a starting point leaves a false impression that there’s been a sharp decline, he said, as methane emissions that year were staggeringly high due to booming production and inadequate pipeline capacity to gather the gas.

DeSilva, the Railroad Commission’s spokesperson, defended using 2019 as the baseline because “about five years ago we began taking proactive steps to reduce flaring in Texas.”

Taking a longer view shows that a median of 2.2% of gas at Texas oil wells was flared or vented over the past decade, according to a ProPublica and Inside Climate News review of state data. (Flaring at gas wells is rare because those sites have the necessary pipeline infrastructure in place to collect the gas.) That figure hovered just north of 2% in the most recently available data, representing a much smaller drop than the state and industry claim. The industry still hasn’t built sufficient pipeline networks to capture gas at oil wells, so, as production rises, so does flaring and venting.

“They can’t get it below 2% because they keep drilling,” DiCarlo said. Since emissions are highest when a well is being drilled, overall emissions will remain high as long as the industry is drilling new wells. “That’s just the nature of the beast.”

Among the largest beneficiaries of the state’s lax permitting system was an oil company called Endeavor Energy Resources. More than half the approved permanent flaring exemptions went to Endeavor, which merged with the $40 billion Diamondback Energy in September 2024. Endeavor also applied for the longest flaring permit — 6,300 days, or more than 17 years. The Railroad Commission approved the permit without shortening its duration.

Diamondback Energy did not respond to a request for comment.

The industry has simultaneously claimed that it is addressing methane while bristling at oversight.

Steven Pruett is the president and CEO of Elevation Resources, a Permian Basin oil company, and the immediate past chair of the Independent Petroleum Association of America, one of the industry’s main trade groups. His company saw a 2,408% increase in flaring immediately following new wells being drilled and a 692% increase in flaring overall in 2023, according to emails unearthed by environmental watchdog organization Fieldnotes and shared with ProPublica and Inside Climate News. In the email exchange with University of Texas faculty who were preparing a grant application for a federal methane-reduction program, Pruett blamed the increases on inadequate infrastructure to capture the gas.

Just weeks later, Pruett participated in a tour of the oil field alongside EPA staff, where he echoed the claim that the American oil and gas industry is cleaner than others and that drilling companies were complying with efforts to reduce emissions.

During his term at the helm of the national trade group, it spearheaded multiple lawsuits against the EPA over the government’s methane rules.

Pruett did not respond to a request for comment.

“A Constant Roar”

Those opposed to flaring face long odds in halting the practice, even in rare instances when the Railroad Commission hears objections.

Consider the experience of Tom Pohlman, then sheriff of Fisher County, who had a flare burning next to his home in the Texas Panhandle starting in October 2023. The driller responsible for it, Patton Exploration, solicited companies to extend a pipeline to the oil well to capture the gas and evaluated whether the gas could be used to mine bitcoin. But by July 2024, it still had no deal, so the company sought another permit to continue flaring up to 1 million cubic feet of gas per day for 18 months. “Patton is diligently pursuing every avenue possible to find a solution, but still needs more time,” the company wrote in its application.

When Pohlman learned that Patton Exploration had applied for a new permit, he and his neighbors urged the Railroad Commission to deny it.

“The sound that comes from the flame is a constant roar that we can hear throughout our property both day and night,” the neighbors wrote in their objection. “There is no peace and quiet since the day of its ignition.”

In September 2024, Pohlman became one of the few people to officially challenge a flaring permit in Texas, as he and Patton Exploration representatives went head-to-head in a hearing before a Railroad Commission administrative law judge.

“For approximately 20 of my residents in this area, it completely lights up their yard and everything else,” Pohlman said, telling the judge that the flare was 45 feet high. “I just need liveability for this neighborhood. We’ve had nothing but issues here.”

Patton Exploration’s lawyer, David Gross, acknowledged the neighbors’ frustrations but emphasized the importance of keeping the well pumping.

“You can’t produce the oil without producing the gas,” he told the judge. “It’s the public policy of Texas that the recoverable oil and gas in the state’s reservoirs be recovered because it is in the public interest.”

In January, the three elected members of the Railroad Commission voted unanimously to approve the permit and allow flaring for another 12 months.",https://media.juancole.com/images/2025/09/texasoil-copy.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 07:03:25.045578

With recent movements in technology and AI, Political Analyst Scott Mitchell talks through the potential impact it could have in Oklahoma, as the AI and energy consumption conversation grows day by day.

Watch the full conversation above or follow along for the biggest takeaways:

Rising Electricity Demand and Market Pressures

Data centers, AI, and big tech companies are major drivers of increased electricity demand, both in Oklahoma and across the U.S.

There's pressure on the grid and concerns that electricity price inflation will soon outpace the general consumer price index due to this rapid demand growth.

New energy generation projects—especially natural gas—face long lead times (up to four years), creating a ""capacity gap"" where demand may outstrip supply.

Oklahoma’s Energy Mix and Transition

The state has transitioned away from out-of-state coal toward local natural gas and renewables, which has reduced emissions, supported local tax bases, and helped keep electricity prices among the cheapest in the nation.

More than 60 renewable projects in Oklahoma have provided significant local economic benefits, especially to landowners and schools, and have enhanced the state’s ability to export electricity.

Oklahoma’s unique taxation and regulatory structure affects oil, gas, and renewable projects differently—renewables typically provide more direct local benefits while oil and gas provide gross production taxes to the state.

Politics and Policy Tensions

State legislative activities and proposals have led to uncertainty, with some described as “anti-business” or as favoring certain energy sectors over others.

There is a perceived lack of a “level playing field” between renewables and oil and gas in terms of regulatory burdens like setbacks and property rights.

National and state politics—including differences between federal administrations and Oklahoma’s own political factions—further complicate energy policy, sometimes leading to confusion and market disruptions.

Economic and Social Impacts

Keeping a broad mix of energy sources is considered essential for suppressing electricity prices and supporting Oklahoma’s economy; removing options could drive prices up, deter business investment, and negatively impact consumers.

Policy shifts that disadvantage renewables could mean lost opportunities, as energy markets are regional—neighboring states could step in to meet demand, taking economic benefits with them.

The discussion repeatedly highlights the strategic importance of energy affordability and supply in attracting and retaining businesses, and the ripple effect on local economies and jobs.

Energy Policy History and Lessons

Oklahoma’s move away from Wyoming coal toward in-state natural gas and renewables is cited as a major positive development, providing local economic, educational, and environmental benefits.

Lessons include the importance of energy self-reliance, supporting local industry, and ensuring that government policies do not unnecessarily obstruct growth or distort market incentives.",https://fueltools-prod01-public.fuelmedia.io/91fa9954-d7e6-483b-9fc0-19e5940628a5/20250907/ddf9f23c-e927-4951-a4d0-8295dba10bcc/thumbnail_20250907025238946.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 08:01:47.399787

A defining energy philosophy Ultimately, Trump’s clean energy stance reflects more than economics.
Wind farms are derided as ugly, solar farms as land-grabbers tied to China, and nuclear energy as the patriotic option that showcases American technology and resilience.","Since returning to the White House, President Donald Trump has been reshaping the United States’ energy policy in ways that have alarmed advocates of renewable energy. His administration has rolled back incentives for wind and solar, halted projects already underway and sought to direct investment toward nuclear power and fossil fuels instead.

According to Reuters, officials close to the president have said the rationale is partly economic, partly aesthetic, and partly nationalistic, as nuclear power is seen as “more American” than wind and solar.

Nuclear as the “patriotic” option

According to Jarrod Agen, director of the US Energy Dominance Council, nuclear power fits more closely with the administration’s long-term vision than other clean energy sources. He argued that nuclear energy is more likely to be built with American parts and by American companies, which makes it a priority for federal financial backing, including loan guarantees and tax breaks, Reuters reported.

Agen described nuclear power as a “long-term play” that had not received the same investment focus as intermittent renewables like wind and solar. He added that the president viewed nuclear expansion as part of a three-pronged strategy to strengthen US energy and technological dominance. These are extending the life of existing coal plants, improving grid efficiency and investing in next-generation nuclear. In this framing, nuclear energy was not just a climate or energy issue but part of a broader competition with China, particularly in the field of artificial intelligence.

Renewables under siege

By contrast, the Trump administration has taken an aggressive stance against wind and solar. Since January, the White House has halted permitting for wind projects on federal land and waters, rescinded Biden-era plans for offshore leasing and revoked permits for projects that were already underway. As per a Bloomberg report, the Revolution Wind project off Rhode Island — 80 per cent complete — was ordered to stop construction, ostensibly on national security grounds.

Trump’s Interior Department has also tightened approval processes for renewable projects, requiring personal sign-off from the Secretary of the Interior for all new wind and solar projects on federal land. This effectively subjects proposals to political scrutiny and delays, while simultaneously expanding opportunities for oil and gas drilling.

Why Trump dislikes wind and solar

The president has made no secret of his disdain for wind and solar power. He has long described wind turbines as ugly, inefficient and even dangerous. In July, after visiting his golf resort in Scotland, he reiterated that “windmills are a disgrace,” calling them bird-killing eyesores and “the most expensive form of energy there is”. Years earlier, he had unsuccessfully tried to block an offshore wind project near the same course.

Solar has fared little better in his rhetoric. Trump has mocked large solar farms as “big ugly patches of black plastic” that despoil farmland and rely heavily on Chinese imports. He has also portrayed renewable power more generally as unreliable, citing the fact that the sun does not always shine and the wind does not always blow. While developers have increasingly turned to batteries to address this intermittency, Trump has remained sceptical, Bloomberg reported.

Reversing the Biden legacy

Trump’s hostility to renewables represents a dramatic reversal of the policies put in place by his predecessor. Under Joe Biden, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was hailed as the most significant climate legislation in US history, providing long-term tax credits and subsidies that spurred a wave of investment in clean energy. But the Trump administration has worked quickly to undermine those measures.

The new tax-and-spending law, branded the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” phases out key credits for wind and solar earlier than planned. The Treasury Department has also issued guidance that makes it more difficult for projects to qualify for the remaining incentives. Beyond subsidies, the administration has launched trade probes that could result in new tariffs on wind turbine parts and polysilicon for solar panels, further raising costs for developers.

The cost debate

The administration has justified its actions partly by pointing to rising electricity costs. Officials have argued that adding renewable energy to the grid has driven up prices for households and businesses. Nationally, electricity costs rose at more than twice the rate of inflation over the past year, a trend the White House attributes to the expansion of intermittent power sources, Bloomberg said.

However, independent analyses suggest a different picture. Much of the increase has come not from renewables themselves but from the cost of upgrading the nation’s aging grid. Utilities have been spending heavily on transmission lines, poles and other infrastructure, both to accommodate new sources of energy and to harden systems against extreme weather. According to Bloomberg, analysts warn that slowing down renewables could actually make the supply crunch worse, as coal and gas plants retire and demand grows from industries such as data centres and artificial intelligence.

Economic fallout for the clean energy sector

The administration’s moves have already had significant economic effects. According to the advocacy group E2, $22 billion worth of clean energy projects were scrapped or downsized in the first half of 2025 alone, with job losses and investment shortfalls concentrated in states that had previously benefited from the IRA. Offshore wind, which was just beginning to take off in the US, has been especially hard-hit, as developers face both political uncertainty and financial losses from halted projects.

Smaller and mid-sized renewable developers are considered particularly vulnerable, lacking the resources to weather prolonged policy shifts. Larger firms have expressed cautious optimism that they can continue building projects grandfathered under existing credits, but even they face a tougher economic environment.

Renewables still competitive

Despite the administration’s rhetoric, independent cost assessments show that renewables remain competitive. BloombergNEF estimates that onshore wind and solar are cheap enough to compete directly with new natural gas plants, even without subsidies. Offshore wind remains more expensive but is still cheaper than new nuclear builds, which are slow to construct and face their own economic hurdles.

Blue states like California and New York continue to push forward with renewable energy, seeking to decarbonise their grids regardless of federal policy. Even in red states, renewables have proven popular. Texas, for instance, has led the country in wind generation and ranks second in solar, with most of its new grid capacity since 2020 coming from renewables or batteries. That momentum, however, could falter under Trump’s accelerated subsidy phaseouts.

Long-term outlook

The uncertainty created by Trump’s policies has raised alarms about the long-term outlook for US renewables. Developers and financiers may grow wary of committing to projects if they fear federal support can be withdrawn suddenly, even for projects already near completion. States counting on offshore wind to meet climate goals and rising demand could face setbacks, while the country as a whole risks losing ground in the global clean energy race.

At the same time, the administration’s favoured alternatives — nuclear and fossil fuels — face their own challenges. New nuclear capacity is years away from becoming operational, while gas and coal plants continue to retire due to age and market pressures. As per Bloomberg, analysts warn that slowing renewables could leave the US struggling to meet rising demand while falling behind in energy innovation.

A defining energy philosophy

Ultimately, Trump’s clean energy stance reflects more than economics. It embodies a broader worldview that prizes nationalism, aesthetics and traditional energy dominance over climate goals. Wind farms are derided as ugly, solar farms as land-grabbers tied to China, and nuclear energy as the patriotic option that showcases American technology and resilience.

The result is a sharp break from the trajectory set under Biden and a return to a vision of energy policy where fossil fuels remain central, and nuclear is elevated as the clean alternative worthy of federal support. Whether that approach can deliver affordable, reliable, and competitive energy for the future remains a subject of fierce debate.","https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2025/08/2-2025-08-44ce44a0c1ca3fd5c3dddb7024d89c69.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)",N,,2025-09-07 08:01:50.690149

The newly released Tesla Model Y L is capturing attention across China, with throngs of potential buyers flocking to showrooms eager to explore this latest addition to Tesla’s electric vehicle lineup. This model enhances the existing Model Y range by offering six seats, as opposed to the traditional five, and is priced at approximately $47,180. Notably, the Model Y L boasts an impressive extended range of up to 751 kilometers (around 467 miles) on a single charge, making it the highest-performing offering within the Model Y series.

Despite a slowdown in Tesla’s sales during the first half of 2025, the overall electric vehicle market is thriving, attributed to decreasing prices, an expanding charging infrastructure, and improvements in vehicle range. This shift towards electric vehicles (EVs) not only provides a more environmentally friendly alternative to traditional gas-powered vehicles but also plays a crucial role in reducing air pollution and mitigating climate change.

Additionally, EV ownership presents long-term financial advantages. As gas prices continue to rise, drivers can benefit from lower operating costs and reduced maintenance requirements associated with EVs. A further cost-saving opportunity exists for those who install solar panels for home charging, allowing them to step away from dependency on the grid or public charging stations. EnergySage offers a streamlined process for comparing quotes from solar panel installers, potentially saving consumers up to $10,000 on installation costs. The combination of EVs and solar energy can significantly diminish individual carbon footprints.

Reports indicate that the Tesla Model Y L has been met with considerable enthusiasm in China, with sources indicating that around 35,000 orders were placed on its launch day. By introducing a higher-range, six-seat option, Tesla seems to be strategically enhancing demand and targeting a broader audience, particularly in a segment that was predominantly filled by the pricier Model X.

Donate Now Building on Bay Area Legacies The Bay Area’s Black churches have long been a force for social change.
“Black churches have always been resilience hubs,” said Carroll, who added that they have often provided tangible support during times of crisis.","HAYWARD, Calif.—On a Sunday morning, the swirling timbre of a Hammond organ drifted into the lobby at Glad Tidings International Church of God in Christ. On the stage, a lively guest preacher, Ronzel Pretlow, roused the congregation in the Hayward, California, church, his raspy voice rising and falling as he sang and shouted, prompting his audience to stand. When the excitement waned, he shifted their attention to Glad Tidings’ founder, Bishop Jerry Macklin, seated in the pulpit.

“I think we owe our Bishop another round of applause for leading us into innovation and creativity,” the preacher said, eliciting a jingle from the organist. “I’m going back home to see if I’ve got room for some electric vehicle chargers,” he joked, knowing the profit that the chargers the church would soon have up and running could bring.

In September, Glad Tidings will complete its new Community Decarbonization Hub—a multipurpose campus featuring a 13,000-square-foot solar-powered building with battery storage and ten EV charging stations. The project, which started four years ago and has a $4.3 million price tag, won’t only cut the church’s energy usage and costs—it’s expected to generate around $500,000 annually. And in five to seven years, as more people charge their vehicles at the church, that amount is projected to double.

Glad Tidings isn’t the only Black church in the Bay Area undergoing this kind of transformation. It’s one of four, thanks to a partnership with Green the Church, an Oakland-based environmental justice nonprofit founded by Reverend Ambrose Carroll, and Gemini Energy Solutions, a cleantech company founded by Stanford University graduate Anthony Kinslow. The hubs Carroll and Kinslow are helping to build won’t only bring clean energy infrastructure to these churches, but also turn them into year-round resilience hubs, ready to support residents when a disaster hits—be it a power outage, wildfire or heatwave.

As climate change progresses and brings more frequent extreme weather events, resilience hubs are becoming increasingly necessary—especially in Black and low-income communities, where legacies of redlining and other forms of racial discrimination have left residents particularly vulnerable. These communities are often the last to receive access to affordable, energy-efficient technology. Still, they persevere through brutal temperatures, hurricanes and other weather disasters, frequently earning praise from political leaders and news media for their resilience.

“Resiliency isn’t enough,” Kinslow said. “Resiliency implies maintaining where you’re at, but I would think most of us would agree that the current baseline isn’t where we want it to be. Communities need to be generating their own money to implement their own decarbonization projects.”

Black churches don’t just need money for decarbonization, but for their basic survival. Across the country, their congregations are shrinking due to aging populations and a larger generational shift away from religion, according to a Gallup study. Unable to rely on tithes and offerings, church leaders are under pressure to find new ways to maintain their buildings—their largest economic assets—and cut costs. Clean energy offers them a way to keep thriving.

Inside the Decarbonization Hub

Bishop Macklin began building his ministry in the late 1970s, when South Hayward was troubled by “drugs, crime, and rampant poverty,” according to the church’s website. Called a “visionary” by many in his circle, about 30 years ago, Bishop Macklin established the Glad Tidings Community Development Corporation (CDC), a separate entity from the church, to help area residents access essential resources, such as food, healthcare and affordable housing. Between the church and the CDC, they’ve acquired enough buildings to cover half a city block.

At the church’s north campus, directly across from the main sanctuary, the new resilience hub features a 5,000-square-foot gymnasium, an exercise room, a STEM lab, a youth lounge, a kitchen and classrooms. Powered by solar energy, the building can accommodate over 500 people in an emergency, providing them with electricity, as well as air conditioning and filtered air. The church will add six EV charging stations to a sliver of parking lot between the resilience hub and the main sanctuary, which will also be equipped with solar panels this fall.

According to Benita McLarin, who leads the Glad Tidings CDC, her team has spent the past six months training a 15-person Community Response Team on fire safety, CPR and mental health first aid. “Bishop Macklin is well respected and people look to him always for answers,” said McLarin, a former military commander and public health official. “He shouldn’t be the only person in our organization who is ready to provide them.”

At the south campus, where the church operates its Spanish-language ministry, four of the fastest EV chargers on the market are already installed under eight solar-paneled carports. McLarin, who drives an EV herself, expects this location to be their greatest revenue generator, as it’s located closest to Highway 880, a major thoroughfare that runs from Oakland to San Jose. Currently, there are few charging options in this part of Hayward, a common issue in many lower-income and Black and brown neighborhoods. These are the same neighborhoods where gig drivers, who often struggle with low wages, tend to live. Access to EVs and charging stations could help them save money in the long term and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the process.

According to Kinslow, Glad Tidings will reinvest 80 percent of its profits back into the church and the larger South Hayward community. “We’re actually building more solar than the demand of the buildings, so we make a profit from that [by selling the excess electricity they generate through the public EV charging stations], and then we use that profit for programming,” Kinslow said.

For example, they may use the funding to provide free solar panels and batteries to income-qualifying households or help to finance electric vehicles for people in the neighborhood. “We see this clean energy hub as the starting point to decarbonizing the rest of the community,” he said. Kinslow’s company is also creating a “Neighborhood Decarbonization Index” that utilizes survey data and machine learning to assess greenhouse gas emissions and evaluate neighborhood decarbonization progress over time.

Partners in Energy and Faith

Kinslow completed his Ph.D. at Stanford and spent most of his student years thinking about how to bring renewable energy to communities of color. Inspired by Al Gore’s documentary “An Inconvenient Truth” in high school, he wanted to make a difference. He launched Gemini Energy Solutions while he was still in graduate school, with the goal of democratizing clean energy. In 2020, he met Bishop Macklin at an event organized by Carroll’s nonprofit, Green the Church (GTC), and was later introduced to McLarin. A year later, they began crafting a plan to bring the community decarbonization hub to fruition.

Gemini Energy Solutions handles project management and community engagement, while Green the Church rallies clergy and collaborates with their internal “green team.” Rev. Carroll founded GTC fifteen years ago and has built relationships with faith leaders across the country. The organization currently has contracts with more than 15 churches, representing various denominations, to develop Community Decarbonization Hubs. In addition to Glad Tidings, GTC and Gemini are working to build these hubs at three other Bay Area churches: Twenty-Third Avenue Church in Oakland, The Way Christian Center in Berkeley and University AME Zion in Palo Alto. Glad Tidings is the furthest along, and the lessons learned there are shaping the work Kinslow and Carroll are doing at the other churches.

According to Kinslow, Pacific Gas & Electric Company’s (PG&E) delays in connecting the solar panels, battery, master meter and EV chargers to the power grid set the project back by about six months. Now, their construction partner, Imperial Electric Service in Fresno, has a designated interconnection representative at PG&E to accelerate future projects.

Gemini’s project team also realized they needed a contractor to explain the impacts of construction, like loss of parking, “which is a big thing for churches,” Kinslow said.

But perhaps the biggest challenge was the two years it took to find financing.

“We started this project based on faith,” said Carroll, noting this was before the Biden administration passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which invested billions in clean energy. But banks struggled to grasp the concept of a Black community generating income rather than an outside company profiting from it, Carroll said. Eventually, he and Kinslow formed a joint entity, Green the Church Renewable Energy Development (GTC R.E.D.), which secured a $3 million revolving loan from the Kresge Foundation to bring clean energy to churches across the country.

More support came from Green Power Ventures, a Black-led investment management firm focused on climate resilience in low- to moderate-income areas, and Freedmen Green Bank & Trust, a Black-led nonprofit and charitable trust devoted to climate resilience and clean energy. And while the churches aren’t putting money into the community decarbonization hubs, Kinslow said, they are investing a lot of “sweat equity.”

Building on Bay Area Legacies

The Bay Area’s Black churches have long been a force for social change. In East Palo Alto, congregants organized community watch programs during times of racial unrest. St. Augustine’s Episcopal Church in Oakland is the birthplace of the Black Panthers’ first free breakfast program, which served undernourished children before school. At the 107-year-old University AME Zion (UAMEZ) church in Palo Alto, they see their forthcoming community decarbonization hub as a continuation of this legacy—and their own commitment to justice.

“When we started talking [about the hub] as a community, it wasn’t like, ‘Why should we do this?’” said UAMEZ Pastor Kaloma Smith. ”It was like, ‘This makes sense for the betterment of our world.’”

Born in Jamaica and raised in New York, Smith arrived at UAMEZ in 2013 to find common challenges facing Black churches, including declining membership. That drop-off is partly from residents leaving Palo Alto—and the state of California—due to rising costs of living, Smith said. The community decarbonization hub is part of his long-term effort to “revitalize” the church and “be more effective, particularly for Gen Z and young families,” for whom he says environmental issues are a top concern.

Working with Kinslow on the hub marks a full-circle moment: he joined the UAMEZ congregation while still a student at Stanford, and approached Pastor Smith with a proposal to replace the sanctuary’s fluorescent lights. “We didn’t really have the money at the time,” said Smith. “But we saw there was phenomenal intersectionality between creating a benefit for the church, the environment and the community.”

Besides installing solar panels and making energy-efficient upgrades, UAMEZ will add 12 to 16 EV charging stations, including eight fast chargers, to its parking lot. Construction of the UAMEZ hub is expected to take only six months, including its connection to the power grid. In the event of an earthquake, Smith envisions UAMEZ as the go-to place for “all the things” residents of midtown Palo Alto might require.

“Black churches have always been resilience hubs,” said Carroll, who added that they have often provided tangible support during times of crisis. But they have the potential to do more, he said, by turning their parking lots into “revenue-generating microgrids” that meet their neighborhoods’ rapidly changing energy and climate needs.

Back in the pulpit at Glad Tidings, pink and purple lights illuminate the stage, casting a glow on Pretlow, the guest preacher, and an attentive congregation. “Prosperity is coming to your house,” he proclaimed, as the bassist plucked his strings. “Favor is getting ready to find your address!” His words seemed fitting for the era Glad Tidings is entering—as if that blessing had already come to pass.

This marks the first project under President Trump’s Nuclear Reactor Pilot Program.

This development represents an advance in providing modular nuclear energy for manufacturing operations, promising a reliable and sustainable energy source.

The Aalo-X represents a new breed of extra modular reactors (XMR), being positioned strategically next to INL’s Materials and Fuels Complex.

The target is for the reactor to reach criticality, enabling a self-sustaining nuclear reaction by 4 July 2026.

Aalo Atomics secured this opportunity through the competitive process managed by the US Department of Energy (DOE) as part of their pilot programme.

Government and national laboratory support

The DOE launched the Nuclear Reactor Pilot Program in June 2025 after Executive Order 14301, reforming testing protocols to authorise advanced nuclear designs at non-traditional sites, thereby fostering innovation for applications such as the growing demands of the manufacturing sector.

Matt Loszak, Co-founder and CEO of Aalo Atomics, says the selection is a clear signal of public-private alignment: “Our selection for the Nuclear Reactor Pilot Program is a significant catalyst for achieving our goal of going from ‘founding to fission’ in less than three years – a feat many deemed impossible just a year ago.

“This milestone groundbreaking event is a testament to the potential that can be unlocked when public entities and private companies partner together in the critical interest of the nation.

""This is a pivotal time for the US nuclear energy industry and we are incredibly proud to be at the forefront.”

Designed as a testing site, INL supports technologies aimed at enhancing energy scalability, reliability and deployment speed—crucial for manufacturing facilities that seek consistent, low-impact energy solutions.

“Today’s ground-breaking symbolises the progress that can be achieved when innovation, vision and national purpose come together,” adds John Wagner, Laboratory Director at INL.

“At Idaho National Laboratory, we are proud to support the Department of Energy’s efforts to accelerate advanced nuclear technologies that strengthen America’s energy security, provide reliable power and inspire the next generation of innovators.

“Projects like Aalo-X reflect the promise of nuclear energy to meet our nation’s historic demand growth and help enable a more prosperous future for our nation.”

Meeting manufacturing energy needs

The Aalo-X reactor serves as a prototype for Aalo’s commercial solution: the Aalo Pod, which is tailored to supply power to manufacturing centres.

That display reminded many of the cold war, but it captured only a fraction of China’s far greater modern influence, primarily built on a formidable economy, dramatic advancements in renewable energy, and a willingness to engage globally with the greatest crisis facing humanity: climate breakdown.

In that sense, the tanks, cannon and missiles that filed past Tiananmen Square may well prove less important in reshaping the world order than the wind turbines, solar panels and electric cars that are churning out of Chinese factories on to fields and roads all over the planet. They are the reason China has already won the battle for the energy of the 21st century.

If history is any guide, the country that dominates energy usually dominates economics and politics, which is why it is not just old war allies that are cosying up to Beijing. Narendra Modi, the president of longtime rival India, also visited China last week for the biggest ever meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation along with dozens of other regional leaders. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, led a delegation to Beijing this summer to coordinate climate policy. The Brazilian executive secretary of Cop30 will visit next week with a similar mission, knowing the success or failure of the annual climate summit now depends on China more than any other nation.

Expectations for Chinese climate leadership are rising in tandem with dismay at the US, which will attend Cop30 as an observer and disrupter that, under Donald Trump, appears to be trying to lurch backwards towards a 20th century comfort zone of oil, gas and coal.

The contrast could become even more striking once China confirms it has reached a positive tipping point after which it will irreversibly shift away from fossil fuels. Last year, the world’s biggest carbon emitter registered a very slight decline in greenhouse gas output. Many analysts believe this means the country’s carbon use will peak this year or very soon. If that is confirmed, it would be a moment of considerably greater significance than Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from UN climate negotiations.

The timing will be clearer when China unveils its revised nationally determined contribution (NDC), the climate actions plans countries promised to provide under the Paris agreement. This announcement, expected before next month’s UN general assembly, will be one of this year’s most eagerly watched declarations because no other country has been able to match China’s power to make or break the Paris targets to hold global heating between 1.5C and 2C.

But how real are the hopes China will step up and show greater leadership on finance and emission cuts, as well as renewable manufacturing?

There have been false dawns in the past. Coal – the most polluting of fossil fuels – drove China’s supercharged economic growth for most of the past three decades, though production declined for a few years in the wake of the global financial crisis and plateaued briefly during the Covid lockdown. Whether predictions of peak carbon prove more substantial this time will depend on the Beijing leadership’s next five-year plan, a domestic policy document for 2026-2030 being drawn up by the leadership in Beijing.

Speculation about the priorities continues to swirl. On one side is caution and a sense of justice that China should not try to step into the void left by the US because that would allow the latter to escape its responsibility as the world’s biggest historic emitter. On the other is geopolitical ambition and the momentum of an economy increasingly reliant on renewable energy investment for growth.

While China’s overall GDP expansion is slowing, the speed of cleantech investment remains breathtakingly fast. Last year, the amount of wind and solar under construction was double the rest of the world combined, helping China to reach an installed capacity of 1,200GW six years ahead of the government’s schedule.

The country is similarly ascendant in supplying overseas markets with renewable technology. Last year for the first time, the top four wind turbine makers in the world were all Chinese. It is a similar story of majority market share for the manufacture and export of photovoltaic cells and electric vehicles.

When it comes to clean energy, it no longer makes sense to talk about competition, says Li Shuo, the director of China Climate Hub at the Asia Society. “There is only one player. The US is not even in the room. I have full confidence that dynamic will continue.”

In the run-up to Belém, the contrast with the US looks ever more stark and is likely to shape geopolitics for decades to come. Under Trump, the US has shut down climate research centres, promised to drill for more gas and declared this to be “the moment” for coal. Meanwhile, $22bn in clean energy projects have been cancelled and wind power investment has shrunk to its lowest level in a decade.

China may not be in favour of multiparty democracy at home, but on the global stage its officials have made clear it will be a champion of multilateral decision making.

Xi has not tried to fill the void left by Trump, but he has presented himself – and China – as a reliable and constructive partner, particularly on the climate issue: “However the world may change, China will not slow down its climate actions, will not reduce its support for international cooperation, and will not cease its efforts to build a community with a shared future for mankind,” he said this year.

Before previous Cops, senior US and Chinese negotiations often held a bilateral meeting to ensure the world’s two biggest emitters were on the same page. This year, China held separate climate talks with the EU and affirmed they would work together to achieve a successful Cop30 with “ambitious and equitable” outcomes. Von der Leyen called the joint declaration a big step forward. “Together, the European Union and China must uphold the Paris agreement. Now more than ever,” she said.

The text did not mention the main areas of friction between the signatories: China’s fast-growing share of sales of electric cars, batteries and solar panels, its stranglehold on critical minerals needed for wind turbine magnets, and its continued heavy investment in coal.

Scientists and campaigners say the climate will not be stabilised solely by selling more photovoltaic cells or windmill blades; it is also necessary to phase out fossil fuels. On this half of the balance sheet, China’s record remains “highly insufficient” and its current policies would, if continued, push the planet towards 4C of heating, according to Climate Action Tracker, an independent initiative assessing countries’ compliance with the Paris agreement. It points out that China is off course from the commitments it previously made to “strictly limit” coal use and to reduce energy and carbon intensity by 2025.

Lauri Myllyvirta of the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), said Xi had compromised. “He does favour cleaning up the energy system and moving to a cleaner economy more broadly – this is a consistent and longstanding feature in his speeches – but clearly it’s not an overriding priority for him when there is pushback.”

The pushback has been most evident in the coal sector, where there has been a surge of investment in the past two years to the highest level in a decade. Major domestic coal companies, such as CHN Energy, Jinneng and Shaanxi Coal and Chemical, have considerable political influence. Although they don’t actively campaign against climate science like Exxon in the US, China analyst Qi Qin said they often pushed the energy security narrative by positioning coal as essential for reliability and independence, adding: “A lot of it comes down to concerns about energy security. During 2021–2022, droughts hit hydropower hard, and the system didn’t have the flexibility to handle that well. That led to some power shortages, and since then, there’s been more focus, especially from local governments, on securing local power supply, which partly explains the new wave of coal project approvals and construction.”

Even so, renewables has moved faster. The share of fossil fuels in China’s installed generation capacity has now fallen below half, down from two-thirds a decade ago. Whether this trend continues will depend on a recent change in energy pricing and the level of ambition in the NDC and five-year plan.

If the government wanted to send a strong signal, it could commit to no new coal power, sectorial targets for electric vehicles, electric steelmaking and building efficiency, and – most importantly – a sizeable cut in overall emissions over a clearly defined period.

Li dampened expectations the headline figure would fully align with the Paris targets. “If China were to set a course for a 1.5C world, it would need to cut emissions by 30% by 2035. A 2C world would mean reductions of 20% by the same year. Neither is likely. He said: “We understand the Chinese side is most likely to provide 8-15%. There will be a gap. If that landing zone is where they end up, then there could be the usual story of ‘under promise, over deliver.’”

He expects specific sectoral targets on how much renewable capacity China will install over the coming decade. “They will be very very big numbers,” Li predicts.

The economy may drive ambition more than politics. Belinda Schäpe, a policy analyst at CREA, said existing trends suggested it was still possible for China to reduce emissions by 30% over the coming decade, which would bring huge economic benefits, especially if combined with a continued global energy transition. “This would also strengthen China’s clean energy industries, which could double in value by 2035, adding CNY 15tn ($2.1tn) to the economy.”

At Belém, China will also seek to boost sales of renewables and possibly announce deals to build and finance a solar panel manufacturing plant in Brazil, in addition to the BYD electric car factory that is already there. This may have the feel of a trade fair, but the conference organisers said this was in line with the primary goal of Cop30, which is to accelerate action on global heating.

Brazilian diplomats also expect their Brics partner to invest in the Tropical Forests Forever Fund, which is the flagship initiative of the summit host. Chinese government sources told the Guardian this proposal was viewed positively in Beijing. Support for this effort to protect standing forests would be a sign of how China is steadily increasing climate finance outside the UN framework as it grows in wealth and responsibility. European diplomats express hope that China will lean in much further during Cop30.

Conservation NGOs hope Beijing will do more to crack down on imports of wood products from areas of illegal deforestation. China’s revised forest law theoretically prohibits these items, but it does not demand transparency or due diligence from traders so little has changed. China remains the biggest importer of illegally felled timber.

At previous Cop meetings, China has often cut an understated figure relative to its size. But its role is often decisive. At Cop26, it aligned with India to water down the language to fossil fuel “phase down” rather than “phase out” and at the 2009 Cop in Copenhagen, it was criticised for sabotaging the conference. More positively, it was widely credited for helping to get the Paris agreement over the line and last year played a crucial role together with the EU to set a climate finance target, the new quantified collective goal, that most countries could sign up to.

China sees itself as a leader of the developing world, but as it has grown richer from renewable technology and is increasingly to blame for the climate crisis (it is now the second biggest emitter), it is under more pressure to cut emissions and pay more to help others do the same. Brazilian diplomats expect their Brics partner to be a quiet but strong supporter of their agenda.

How far it goes is still to be seen, but the direction of travel is at least clear – and it is the opposite of the US.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e15ae8a33c3fce2a09a434aa480021c97716990d/625_0_3750_3000/master/3750.png?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=51c4fc10b69e1f9009b29e2ccfa6ede0",N,,2025-09-07 05:00:24.905251

Robotic arms swing methodically, while digital screens display real-time production data.

The park has established a complete industrial chain covering research and design, manufacturing and quality testing, according to He Changguo, manager of the firm's northern regional manufacturing center. Since 2008, wind turbines produced in the park have been deployed in more than 100 projects across China.

This facility epitomizes the accelerating pace of Inner Mongolia's green transition. Rich in coal and central to China's energy supply, the region accounted for more than one-quarter of the nation's coal output in 2024. This wealth of resources fueled decades of growth but also tied the region to high-polluting and resource-heavy industries.

In recent years, however, the nationwide low-carbon push has set the region on a new course. By tapping its abundant wind and solar resources, the region is cultivating fresh momentum for growth. Once renowned for its coal reserves and desert environment, Inner Mongolia is now dotted with vast arrays of solar panels and wind turbines.

So far, over 30 companies similar to Ming Yang Smart Energy Group, which operate full industrial chains in the new energy sector, have taken root in the region. In 2024, the added value of large-scale new energy and related industries rose by 20.1 percent compared with 2023, and that of new energy equipment manufacturers surged 42.4 percent year on year.

Gong Mingzhu, director of the regional Development and Reform Commission, said Inner Mongolia has established a comprehensive industrial chain for wind, solar, hydrogen and energy storage equipment manufacturing, effectively positioning the region to embark on a new chapter in industrial development.

As new energy industries gain momentum, Inner Mongolia is also transforming its traditional coal-based sectors, shifting from simple extraction toward a more diversified and cleaner industrial system.

A plant in Ordos exemplifies this transformation. Built by Inner Mongolia Baofeng Coal-based New Material Co., Ltd., the facility synthesizes olefins -- a class of chemical compounds serving as key raw materials for industrial products from plastics to textiles and aerospace components -- from coal.

With an annual production capacity of 3 million tonnes, this facility stands as the world's largest single-site coal-to-olefins project, according to the company.

Notably, the plant employs green hydrogen at scale to replace fossil fuels in olefin production, reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 6.3 million tonnes annually.

In 2024, Inner Mongolia's modern coal chemical industry output exceeded 100 billion yuan (about 14.07 billion U.S. dollars), while the region ranked first nationwide in both coal-to-gas and coal-to-olefin production capacities.

""Simply mining and selling coal cannot fully realize the value of Inner Mongolia's energy endowment, nor can it meet the requirements of building a modern country,"" said Hu Chengdong, deputy director of the regional energy bureau.

It is imperative for Inner Mongolia to transition from an extractive growth model, shift from factor-driven to innovation-driven development, and propel traditional industries toward higher efficiency and greater value, Hu added. ■",,N,,2025-09-07 07:02:38.516841

Implications for Investors: Risks and Rewards For EV investors, Rivian's strategy presents a compelling but high-risk proposition.
However, execution risks remain: - Production Delays: The temporary shutdown of the Normal plant in September 2025 to retool for R2 production could disrupt delivery targets.","The electric vehicle (EV) market has entered a new phase of brutal competition, where margin preservation and capital efficiency are no longer optional—they are existential imperatives. Rivian Automotive Inc (RIVN) has positioned itself at the forefront of this transformation, leveraging supplier renegotiations, production scaling, and design simplification to outpace rivals like Tesla (TSLA) and BYD (BYDDY). For investors, the question is no longer whether Rivian can survive this environment but whether its strategic pivot to lean production and commercial vehicle focus can unlock long-term value in a sector increasingly defined by razor-thin margins.

Capital Efficiency: The R2 Revolution

Rivian's transition from the R1 to the R2 model represents a masterclass in capital efficiency. The R2, a midsize SUV priced at $45,000, is designed to be 40% cheaper to produce per unit than the R1 lineup. This cost reduction stems from two pillars: supplier renegotiations and design simplification.

Supplier Contracts and Bill of Materials (BOM) Optimization:

Rivian has secured 50% lower component costs for the R2 compared to the R1, with a BOM of $32,000 per unit. This was achieved through aggressive supplier renegotiations and a shift to U.S.-based sourcing, which avoids 25% import tariffs. By locking in these costs, Rivian insulates itself from the volatility that has plagued competitors like BYD, whose Q2 2025 gross margin fell to 16.3% due to price wars in China.

Conversion Cost Reduction:

The R2's simplified architecture—streamlined body design, fewer wiring harnesses, and modular closures—reduces assembly complexity. Rivian projects conversion costs for the R2 to be less than half of those for the R1, a critical advantage in an industry where fixed costs dominate. This contrasts sharply with Tesla's recent struggles, where Q2 2025 automotive gross margins fell to 18% despite energy storage profits.

Supply Chain Optimization: Scaling Without Sacrificing Profitability

Rivian's ability to scale production while maintaining cost discipline is underpinned by its dual-facility strategy. The Normal, Illinois plant, now expanded to 1.1 million square feet, will produce 215,000 R2 units annually by 2026. This is complemented by the Georgia facility, a $5 billion project set to begin production in 2028 with 400,000-unit capacity. Crucially, Rivian has secured a $6.6 billion Department of Energy loan and a $1 billion Volkswagen investment to fund these expansions, ensuring capital efficiency without diluting equity.

The Georgia plant's phased approach—200,000 units per phase—allows Rivian to align production with demand, avoiding the overcapacity pitfalls that have plagued Tesla's Gigafactories. Meanwhile, the R2's U.S.-based production and eligibility for the $7,500 federal EV tax credit further enhance gross margins, a stark contrast to BYD's reliance on price cuts to maintain volume.

Margin Projections: A Path to Outperformance

Rivian's Q2 2025 results—$206 million gross profit loss—highlight its current challenges. However, the company's trajectory is clear: it anticipates gross margins above 20% by 2026, driven by R2's cost structure and economies of scale. This would outperform Tesla's 18% and BYD's 16.3%, positioning Rivian as a margin leader in a sector where profitability is increasingly elusive.

The key differentiator lies in Rivian's commercial vehicle focus. While Tesla and BYD compete in the consumer segment, Rivian's Electric Delivery Van (EDV) and R2's commercial potential offer higher-margin opportunities. Amazon's 100,000 EDV order and Rivian's partnerships with logistics firms provide a stable revenue stream, reducing reliance on volatile consumer demand.

Implications for Investors: Risks and Rewards

For EV investors, Rivian's strategy presents a compelling but high-risk proposition. The company's focus on lean production and commercial vehicles aligns with long-term trends in logistics electrification and U.S. manufacturing. However, execution risks remain:

- Production Delays: The temporary shutdown of the Normal plant in September 2025 to retool for R2 production could disrupt delivery targets.

- Tariff and Regulatory Shifts: The expiration of the EV tax credit in September 2025 and potential changes in trade policy could erode margins.

- Competition: Tesla's vertical integration and BYD's cost leadership pose ongoing threats, particularly in the mass-market segment.

That said, Rivian's capital-efficient model and strategic partnerships with Volkswagen and the Department of Energy provide a buffer against these risks. For investors with a medium-term horizon, Rivian's ability to achieve EBITDA breakeven by 2027 and its projected margin outperformance make it a high-conviction play in the EV sector.

Buyers are making quick decisions to take advantage of the expiring incentive.

Washington had a record year for electric vehicle sales in 2023, with registrations increasing by 43%. Nearly 224,000 electric vehicles are now on the state’s roads.

Steven Hershkowitz from the Washington Department of Commerce noted Washington’s leadership in electric vehicle sales.

“Nationally, we haven’t seen a huge spike in sales, a little bit of an increase, and we expect that increase to go up quite a bit in September before the tax credit expires,” he said.

Incentives have played a significant role in driving this growth. Last year, a state rebate program offered up to $9,000, but demand was so high that it sold out in just three months.

“Commerce ran a program called the EV Instant Rebate Program. It offered up to nine thousand dollars for new leases as compared to the seventy-five hundred that are offered at the federal level under the tax credits. It ended in 82 days. Last year, it was so popular that we ran through the more than six thousand rebates in less than three months,” Hershkowitz stated.

For climate officials, electric vehicle sales are not just about incentives. They emphasize the importance of adoption as Washington faces the challenges of a changing climate. Jennifer Hennessey from the Washington Department of Ecology highlighted the current impacts.

“In Washington, climate change impacts are already here. We’re seeing wildfires around the state and smoke that comes with it, heat waves. This is our third year in a row declaring drought, and all of these impacts are putting lives and livelihoods here in Washington at risk,” Hennessey said.

With the federal tax credit expiring soon, officials are urging buyers ready to switch to electric vehicles not to delay.

“This is definitely going to be a good moment to go out and get an EV,” Hennessey advised.

Even after the credit expires, Washingtonians are expected to continue embracing electric vehicles at a record pace.",https://www.fox28spokane.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/6887be412d143.image_.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 07:02:03.827240

Not only is renewable energy known to be better for the planet, but it can also help make energy cheaper for people. Who would complain about spending less on energy bills?

The National Grid claims that ""solar and wind energy are now the most affordable sources of new electricity in 82% of the world.""

Moving toward a more self-sustainable model of energy production, such as wind farming, can also create more stability for a country's electrical grid. In the transition to clean energy, new jobs will be created for the local community and help boost the economy.

Renewable sources of electricity help energy providers move away from relying on dirty fuels, which are known to be harmful to the health of people and the planet. Research by Harvard University links pollution to respiratory issues, cardiovascular problems, cancer, reproductive and developmental impacts, and even an increased risk of premature death.

Moving toward energy sources that cause fewer health issues can only be a step in the right direction for a cleaner, safer future. Enormous companies like Amazon getting behind a greener option is heartening to see.

The managing director of Amazon Web Services over much of Southeast Asia, Jeff Johnson, commented per Renewable Energy Magazine: ""We're proud to work with forward-thinking organisations like Gentari who share our commitment to both technological advancement and environmental stewardship.""

China has dramatically increased its investment footprint in Brazil's energy landscape, establishing itself as a dominant foreign investor in South America's largest economy. In 2024, Chinese investments in Brazil more than doubled year-over-year, reaching $4.18 billion across 39 projects, with the China investment in Brazil energy sector capturing the largest share of this capital influx. This strategic focus reflects China's dual approach to securing both traditional and renewable resources while expanding its global economic influence.

The power sector, particularly solar and wind projects, received 34% ($1.43 billion) of total Chinese investments in Brazil during 2024, while oil and gas attracted 25% ($1 billion). This balanced approach demonstrates China's pragmatic energy transition trends that simultaneously advances renewable capacity while maintaining access to fossil fuel resources.

What Drives China's Interest in Brazilian Energy Resources?

Strategic Resource Security

China's investment strategy in Brazil is fundamentally driven by resource security concerns. As the world's largest energy consumer, China seeks to diversify its supply sources and reduce vulnerability to market volatility and geopolitical tensions. Brazil offers an attractive combination of established oil production, renewable energy potential, and critical minerals necessary for energy transition technologies.

The investments serve multiple strategic objectives:

Securing long-term access to Brazil's offshore oil reserves

Establishing positions in renewable energy development

Accessing critical minerals like lithium, niobium, and rare earths

Building influence in a major regional economy with significant natural resources

Complementary Energy Policies

Both China and Brazil pursue parallel energy strategies that combine aggressive renewable energy expansion with continued fossil fuel development. Brazil maintains approximately 90% renewable electricity generation (primarily hydropower) while simultaneously expanding its oil production capacity. Similarly, China leads globally in renewable energy deployment while continuing to develop coal, oil, and gas resources.

This policy alignment creates natural investment synergies, allowing Chinese firms to pursue diverse energy projects that match their domestic expertise and strategic priorities. According to a recent analysis by Alvarez & Marsal, this complementary approach has positioned Brazil as China's third-largest investment destination globally.

Which Sectors Receive the Most Chinese Investment?

Renewable Energy Dominance

Since 2007, Chinese companies have invested $77.5 billion across 303 projects in Brazil, with the power sector claiming the largest share at 45% of total investments. Major Chinese energy corporations have established significant positions in Brazil's renewable energy landscape:

China Three Gorges (CTG): Acquired multiple hydroelectric assets and developed solar projects

State Power Investment Corporation (SPIC): Invested in wind and solar facilities

CGN Power: Developed utility-scale solar installations and transmission infrastructure

The Luiz Gonzaga Solar Complex represents one flagship project with substantial Chinese investment, highlighting the scale of renewable energy commitments and battery recycling innovation efforts.

Oil and Gas Strategic Positioning

The oil industry ranks as the second-largest recipient of Chinese investment at 29% of the cumulative total since 2007. Chinese national oil companies have secured stakes in Brazil's prolific pre-salt offshore oil basin, which has driven most of Brazil's production growth in recent years.

These investments provide China with:

Direct access to Brazilian crude oil exports

Participation in production sharing agreements

Technology transfer opportunities in deep-water exploration

Diversification away from Middle Eastern oil dependencies

Critical Minerals and Manufacturing

Beyond direct energy investments, Chinese firms have strategically targeted Brazil's mining sector, focusing on materials essential for the energy transition supply chain. For example, China Nonferrous Metal Mining Group (CNMC) acquired Brazilian firm Mineração Taboca, the country's largest refined tin producer, for $340 million in late 2024.

This acquisition secured access to:

Tin (used in solar panel manufacturing)

Niobium (critical for high-strength steel and superconductors)

Tantalum (essential for electronics and energy storage)

Manufacturing investments have also followed, representing 8% of total Chinese investment since 2007, often supporting energy-related supply chains.

What Are the Recent Investment Trends?

Accelerating Capital Flows

Chinese investment in Brazil energy has shown remarkable acceleration in recent years. The $4.18 billion invested in 2024 represented a 113% increase compared to 2023, while the number of projects grew by 34% year-over-year. This surge has positioned Brazil as the top emerging market destination for Chinese foreign direct investment.

Recent high-profile investments include:

Envision Group's $1 billion sustainable aviation fuel project (2025)

CGN's $529 million combined wind and solar developments (2025)

Multiple transmission infrastructure projects to support renewable integration

Shifting Focus to Energy Transition

While maintaining positions in oil and gas, Chinese investors have increasingly targeted projects supporting Brazil's energy transition. These investments align with Brazil's ""Fuel of the Future"" initiative and its ambition to become a global green energy hub, as reported by China News.

Investments now frequently support:

Local manufacturing of wind turbine components (60-80% locally produced)

Green hydrogen development infrastructure

Electric vehicle supply chain integration

Smart grid and energy storage technologies

What Challenges Do These Investments Face?

Political and Regulatory Risks

Chinese companies consistently identify political risk as their primary concern when investing in Brazil. The country's complex regulatory environment and history of policy shifts create uncertainty, particularly with elections expected in 2026 that could affect the investment strategy insights.

Key risk factors include:

Potential changes to foreign investment regulations

Environmental licensing delays and complications

Local content requirements and labor regulations

Currency volatility affecting project economics

Environmental and Social Considerations

As investments expand into environmentally sensitive areas, Chinese companies face increasing scrutiny regarding environmental and social impacts. This is particularly relevant for investments in:

Amazon basin oil exploration (such as Petrobras' efforts in Foz do Amazonas)

Hydroelectric projects affecting indigenous territories

Mining operations in ecologically sensitive regions

Chinese investors must navigate these complexities while maintaining their strategic objectives and addressing stakeholder concerns.

How Does This Investment Affect Brazil-China Relations?

Economic Integration

China has maintained its position as Brazil's largest trading partner for 15 consecutive years, with energy investments deepening this economic relationship. The growing investment ties create mutual dependencies that shape diplomatic and economic relations between the two BRICS nations.

Trade and investment flows have created:

Increased Brazilian commodity exports to China

Growing Chinese manufactured goods imports to Brazil

Technological collaboration in energy sectors

Financial cooperation through development banks

Geopolitical Implications

The strengthening Brazil-China energy partnership carries significant geopolitical implications, particularly as both nations seek to expand their influence in global energy markets and governance structures. Their cooperation represents a major South-South partnership that challenges traditional North-South investment patterns and creates potential trade war impact concerns.

This relationship influences:

Global oil market dynamics

International climate negotiations

Regional economic integration in South America

Multilateral institutions like BRICS and G20

What Does the Future Hold for Chinese Energy Investments in Brazil?

Continued Growth Trajectory

All indicators suggest China investment in Brazil energy will continue their upward trajectory. The complementary nature of their energy strategies, Brazil's abundant resources, and China's capital availability create powerful incentives for ongoing partnership.

Future investment areas likely include:

Expanded offshore oil development

Accelerated utility-scale solar and wind deployment

Green hydrogen production facilities

Battery manufacturing and energy storage

Critical mineral supply chain integration

Strategic Adaptation

As global energy markets evolve, Chinese investments will likely adapt to changing priorities while maintaining core strategic objectives. This may include greater emphasis on technologies supporting electrification, digitalization, and decarbonization while maintaining positions in conventional energy resources.

The investment relationship will continue balancing:

Short-term resource security needs

Long-term energy transition goals

Technological leadership ambitions

Economic and political influence objectives

Conclusion

China's multibillion-dollar investments in Brazil's energy sector represent a sophisticated strategy that secures access to both traditional and renewable resources while expanding economic influence in Latin America's largest economy. The complementary energy policies of both nations create natural investment synergies, despite apparent contradictions between fossil fuel development and renewable energy expansion.

As Brazil positions itself to host the COP30 climate summit while simultaneously pursuing oil production growth, Chinese investment provides crucial capital and technology to advance both conventional and renewable energy development. This partnership will continue shaping global China investment in Brazil energy markets, supply chains, and geopolitical relationships in the coming decades.

The dual focus on securing traditional energy resources while investing heavily in renewables reflects a pragmatic approach to energy transition—one that acknowledges the continuing importance of fossil fuels while building the infrastructure for a lower-carbon future. As this investment relationship evolves, it will significantly influence both countries' energy landscapes and their positions in the global energy order.

The person posted images in the r/teslamotors subreddit showing the severed cables and a repair truck that had arrived to fix the problem.

""Someone keeps cutting the SC Cables at the [Cincinnati] Meijer,"" they wrote. ""Tech showed up while I was there and said it happened the day before as well. Camera only can see last 4, which are never cut.""

Meijer is just one store that has worked to expand its EV charging options. Target, Walmart, Kroger, and Ikea are others, and it's a sign of the times: More than 1 in 5 vehicles purchased this year will be electric.

While the proliferation of charging stations is good news, there is more work to be done. It has become clear that these chargers, which feature thick copper wires inside insulated cables, will continue to be targeted by thieves.

The Biden-Harris administration has said there will be 200,000 chargers available to drivers by the end of the year, but the rollout has been slow.

Watch now: Uber-wealthy couple makes unprecedented move with $300 million land

Ride-hailing company Uber is offering drivers up to $22,000 to buy EVs as we work to decarbonize the transportation sector.

Internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) are powered by gasoline, a source of dirty energy that pollutes the environment, harms our health, and costs more money than electricity. In one year of use, an ICEV releases 2 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e), while an EV releases zero, according to Recurrent.

Critics trumpet the outsize pollution that comes with manufacturing an EV — especially the battery — but EVs are still much better for the environment, our well-being, and our wallets than ICEVs over the vehicles' lifetimes.

Despite contributing 14 tCO2e during production — compared to 10 tCO2e for an ICEV — and 26 tCO2e for charging from the grid (which is mostly still powered by gas, coal, and oil), an EV's pollution output is 39 tCO2e over 16 years. On the other hand, an ICEV's tCO2e is 55, more than 58% of which comes from tailpipe pollution.

Thankfully, it seems there's a simple way to prevent EV charging stations from being destroyed.

The Nebraska State Fair is a yearly reminder of the values that make the Good Life in our state.","One of my biggest priorities as your Senator is hearing directly from Nebraskans. I continue to do what I did as Governor. I travel the state, talk to Nebraskans, and listen to their concerns. Last week, I welcomed hundreds of Nebraskans to my annual Federal Issues Forum at the State Fair in Grand Island. I’m grateful for everyone who attended.

The Federal Issues Forum is an event where we discuss federal issues impacting Nebraskans. This year, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin and Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso joined me. We highlighted solutions to get America back on track. Senate Republicans and the Trump Administration are delivering for Nebraska. We are fighting to protect and promote the Good Life.

Administrator Zeldin and I discussed the importance of the EPA cutting excessive regulation. Nobody cares more about preserving our water, air, and land resources than our farmers and ranchers. They are the original conservationists. What farmers and ranchers want are common-sense rules and regulations that allow them to continue managing their land. That’s what Administrator Zeldin and I are fighting to deliver.

Reining in overregulation means reforming rules like Waters of the United States (WOTUS). In 1972, Congress passed the Clean Water Act. This gave the EPA authority over navigable waters like lakes, rivers, and oceans. Then, the Obama and Biden administrations tried to illegally increase the EPA’s authority. They redefined what navigable waters are. They claimed that navigable waters include roadside ditches, puddles on construction sites, and farm ponds. Last time I checked, those aren’t navigable waters. That’s not what Congress voted for. Administrator Zeldin and I are putting an end to this kind of overreach.

Administrator Zeldin and I also discussed the Renewable Fuel Standard. He previously committed to me that EPA would follow the standard Congress passed. This includes getting the process back on schedule. The EPA’s most recent Renewable Volume Obligations exceeded our expectations. It will drive strong biofuel markets. This will benefit energy consumers with cheaper prices at the pump, help clean up our environment, and be great for our farmers and ranchers. The Biden administration ignored biofuels and weakened American energy independence. We’re unleashing American energy dominance again.

Senator Barrasso and I discussed how the One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) strengthens Nebraska families. It’s rare to have the opportunity to pass legislation that preserves the Good Life for generations.

The One Big Beautiful Bill is good for families. It avoids a $2,400 tax hike on the average Nebraska family. OBBB expands the child tax credit. It makes the Death Tax exemption permanent. OBBB expands child and dependent care credits while increasing take-home pay by up to $9,000. It ensures no tax on tips or overtime. 88% of seniors will no longer pay taxes on Social Security due to a new $6,000 tax credit. OBBB includes a $50 billion rural health care fund. This makes sure Nebraska gets a minimum of $100 million each of the next five years. OBBB secures our border. It promotes peace through strength by deterring foreign adversaries like Communist China.

Senator Barrasso and I also discussed historic votes from this Congress. Bipartisan laws like the HALT Fentanyl Act and the Laken Riley Act are keeping Nebraskans safe. We have confirmed 125 of Trump’s nominees. We passed a $9 billion cut to spending.

After the Federal Issues Forum, I walked around the state fair. I spoke with small business owners, fair staff, and Nebraskans enjoying the fair. I saw the ingenuity of Nebraska entrepreneurs at the expo hall. I saw the impressive livestock shown in fair competition by our next generation of farmers and ranchers. I was even able to help show a Rambouillet ram in competition. I also won a blue ribbon!

Nebraska is what America is supposed to be. The reason is our people. As I travel across our state, I’m reminded of the values that make Nebraska special. We’re committed to faith, family, community, and hard work. These values are the same ones that guide my service to Nebraska.

""The momentum is incredible,"" said Tyler Gerczak, Oak Ridge National Laboratory's principal investigator for the cooperative with X-energy's subsidiary TRISO-X.
If timelines hold, Americans could see this next generation of nuclear fuel powering homes and businesses before the end of the decade.","At Oak Ridge National Laboratory, researchers are crafting what look like gray pool balls (or pebbles) that may hold the power to usher in a new era of nuclear energy in the U.S.

But inside, they're packed with thousands of tiny uranium particles enriched beyond what today's power plants use.

Built by X-energy at Oak Ridge in Maryland, the researchers hope to fuel a new wave of nuclear reactors, expected to be operational by 2030, as Tech Xplore reported. This includes companies like Standard Nuclear and Orano, producing fuel and enrichment facilities to help reach that goal.

The uranium-based fuel, Tri-structural Isotropic particle fuel or TRISO, inside the pebbles is the ""most robust nuclear fuel on Earth,"" according to the Department of Energy, as it cannot melt in a reactor. Each pebble can cycle through a high-temperature reactor multiple times, making it more efficient and safer than traditional fuel rods.

This breakthrough couldn't come at a more critical time. Nuclear fission, the process of splitting atoms to release energy, is far cleaner than coal or gas, generating large amounts of power without the same level of climate-warming pollution.

But new advanced reactors need advanced fuels, and right now, most of the world's supply chain for high-assay, low-enriched uranium is controlled by Russia and China. X-energy's work represents a push for the U.S. to ramp up domestic production and reduce dependence on foreign sources.

Still, experts caution that nuclear power isn't a clean energy silver bullet. Building new reactors is costly and often delayed. And while TRISO fuel is designed to be safer, it's not unlimited, and all nuclear waste must still be contained and stored securely to avoid disasters to human health and the environment.

Even so, the potential is enormous as we continue to rely more and more on massive amounts of energy to power new technology. If advanced reactors paired with TRISO fuel succeed, they could provide stable, low-carbon power that supports renewables like wind and solar, reducing air pollution and making the grid more resilient against extreme weather and climate.

Therefore, these small TRISO pebbles could have a huge impact by cutting pollution, strengthening U.S. energy security, and potentially lowering costs for consumers.

""The momentum is incredible,"" said Tyler Gerczak, Oak Ridge National Laboratory's principal investigator for the cooperative with X-energy's subsidiary TRISO-X.

With $2 billion invested in a fuel production campus in Oak Ridge, X-energy hopes that by 2028, the factory could produce enough TRISO pebbles to power 11 new reactors, with plans for a large production facility by 2029. Amazon has also invested in X-energy in hopes of helping to fuel its power-hungry data centers.

During his holiday in Scotland last month, the US vice-president held private talks with a string of major US nuclear companies about projects they are pursuing in the UK.

Executives from Westinghouse, GE Hitachi, X-energy, Holtec International and TerraPower, the nuclear developer co-founded by Bill Gates, are understood to have attended the meeting.

It was scheduled to last just 20 minutes but ultimately went on for double that amount of time, multiple sources confirmed.

Now with less than a fortnight before the president touches down for his state visit in London, the White House is understood to be lobbying in support of plans for American companies to build nuclear power plants and data centres that could power artificial intelligence (AI) software in the UK.

These include a major nuclear plant proposed by Westinghouse on the island of Anglesey, North Wales, as well as a string of miniature plants that X-energy, the start-up backed by Amazon, wants to build in industrial areas across the country.

Mr Vance’s meeting with nuclear companies is understood to have been billed as a fact-finding mission to explore opportunities for US business in Britain.

But government sources acknowledged that both countries see nuclear energy as key to meeting the massive electricity demands expected to come from AI data centres and are discussing how to work more closely together.

One well-placed British source who is familiar with the discussions said: “The White House wants announcements for Trump to make while he’s here.

“So there is huge pressure to make that happen. But the Government won’t allow that to happen unless there are credible proposals from the nuclear companies on the table.”

On Friday, Lord Mandelson, the British ambassador to Washington, also hinted that deals spanning energy, defence, AI and quantum computing were potentially on the cards, with a view to “create jobs, drive innovation and ensure that British and American ingenuity continues to lead the world”.

While once the preserve of national energy companies, Silicon Valley’s tech giants are piling into nuclear energy because it is seen as the only clean, large and uninterrupted power source capable of meeting the 24/7 needs of data centres.

X-energy is seeking to build an advanced modular reactor (AMR) in Hartlepool, County Durham, with a view to building up to 10 in the UK if it proves successful.

The company is understood to be regarded as highly credible within Whitehall and is in talks about receiving potential debt and equity financing from the National Wealth Fund.

It is also seeking revenue support and guarantees that the Government will follow through on planning reforms that would let nuclear companies build mini reactors near cities.

In June, The Telegraph also revealed that Westinghouse was in talks with the Government about a proposed large nuclear power station at Wylfa, Anglesey.

Westinghouse is pushing for the site to be set aside for the project, which could see it build four large reactors capable of generating almost five gigawatts of electricity – enough to power millions of homes.

The company insists the scheme would be privately financed, and so kept off the Government’s balance sheet, but it is seeking minimum revenue guarantees and £50m to carry out a feasibility study.

However, the proposal has created a potential dilemma for Ed Miliband, the Energy Secretary, as Wylfa is also being eyed as a potential testbed for the first mini nuclear reactors plants designed by Rolls-Royce, which are due to be built by the mid-2030s.

On Friday, a government spokesman declined to comment on talks with the Trump administration, but said: “Over the past year we’ve taken action to deliver a golden age of nuclear for Britain, with record funding for Sizewell C and our first small modular reactors – creating thousands of new, skilled jobs through the Plan for Change.

“No decisions on a future large-scale nuclear project have been made.”

The Frontline Communities Protection Act is a state law that creates a new permitting process for industry in impoverished, minority ""environmental justice"" communities.","The path to Minnesota's groundbreaking, new anti-pollution law began at a metal-shredding facility in Minneapolis before spreading its ""toxic soup"" along the banks of the Mississippi.

The factory, now shut, was once recognized as a source of lead, chromium and other pollution by state regulators — as well as by concerned locals such as Roxxanne O'Brien.

But as O'Brien focused on fallout from the metals factory on her impoverished north Minneapolis neighborhood, her gaze widened to the many other industrial operations lining the river, each spewing out its own cocktail of pollutants.

""All of these different industries combined were creating a toxic soup,"" O'Brien, a mother of three, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

She refers to these combined pollution levels as ""cumulative impacts"" — when multiple sources of pollution come together and hurt human health.

It is a particular concern in poor, minority areas, she said, citing places such as north Minneapolis, where heavy industry, manufacturing and transport tend to concentrate.

Regulators, meanwhile, have focused on individual operations rather than look at the implications of a concentration of industry in any given area.

But O'Brien, co-founder of a group called Community Members for Environmental Justice, is now hoping she has a solution.

The Frontline Communities Protection Act is a state law that creates a new permitting process for industry in impoverished, minority ""environmental justice"" communities.

The law passed in 2023, and an implementation framework is due by next May.

It’s the country’s third, after New Jersey and New York.

The trend offers a major new tool to address pollution in ""overburdened"" communities that backers say local officials are increasingly taking up.

This comes as President Donald Trump undermines national momentum on the issue through funding cuts and by banning government ""diversity, equity and inclusion"" efforts that could have helped impacted communities stave off pollution.

The Environmental Protection Agency, which in November released an interim framework for a national policy, has now ""paused"" that work, a spokesperson told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

The Minnesota bill met with pushback from industry groups, including local chambers of commerce and utilities, warning it could stifle economic development or duplicate existing rules.

Yet the need for change is a ""no-brainer,"" said Minnesota state Representative Fue Lee, who spearheaded the law.

""If we have the tools already, why are community members still coming to me to have the state step in?""

Discussion of the cumulative effects of air, water and soil pollution took root in the 1980s and 1990s as communities grew frustrated with regulators' reliance on risk analysis that didn’t reflect the harm they'd witnessed first hand.

More racially segregated areas are up to 75% more likely to have high copper, chromium, lead and other particulate concentrations, with low-income communities suffering higher levels of asthma, diabetes and hypertension, according to the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators.

A facility permit might allow a set level of pollutants but did so without taking into account what other industries were polluting the area, said Ana Baptista, director of the Tishman Environment and Design Center at the New School in New York.

""So communities would be hitting brick walls every time they tried to fight these facilities,"" Baptista said.

She helped get the first such law enacted in New Jersey.

The new law requires regulators to consider the cumulative effects of polluting industries, strengthens their power to win changes and ensure that local voices are part of the process.

While it is too early to gauge the impact, New Jersey regulators in May issued their first decision under the law, on permits for a recycling plant, and ordered changes.

Campaigners applauded that milestone but said ""significantly more could have been done to ensure protections for the surrounding overburdened communities,"" according to the New Jersey Environmental Justice Alliance, a coalition of groups.

In addition to Minnesota and New York, dozens of states and cities — including Maryland, D.C. and Colorado — have proposed similar laws, according to tracking by the Tishman Center.

The return of Trump has prompted many communities to turn to state legislators for their help, said Baptista, since they no longer feel the federal government will protect them.

In 2019, researchers found that Chicago had a life expectancy gap between racially segregated neighborhoods of 30 years — the country’s widest such discrepancy.

Clustering industries in certain areas had measurable fallout: high levels of cancer, asthma and other respiratory illnesses, said Iyana Simba of the Illinois Environmental Council, an advocacy group that represents 130 groups.

""It's not just one single factory or warehouse. It's these communities that have several in the same area,"" she said.

The mayor and others introduced a cumulative impacts bill in April, for an ordinance that could be voted on in coming weeks.

In Minnesota, negotiations are continuing on how to implement the new law ahead of next May's deadline, with particular focus on the inclusion of ""community benefits.""

That could mean mitigating pollution, paying for the health problems it caused, ringfencing jobs for locals or even helping with housing, said Sasha Lewis-Norelle, an organizer with COPAL, an advocacy group that works with Minnesota’s Latino community.

""It has felt really important to work on these local laws and regulations as we're seeing so many rules from the federal level be taken away,"" he said.",https://www.japantimes.co.jp/japantimes/uploads/images/2025/09/07/492229.jpg?v=3.1,N,,2025-09-07 07:03:29.207915

A U.S.-based nuclear fusion startup is setting its sights on Japan as a key market for deploying its advanced reactor technology, signaling a potential shift in global energy strategies. Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS), a Massachusetts company backed by tech giants like Nvidia, has initiated discussions with Japanese government officials about bringing its fusion power plants to the island nation. According to reporting in The Japan Times, CFS aims to have a reactor operational in Japan by the late 2030s or early 2040s, aligning with Tokyo’s push for carbon-neutral energy sources.

This move comes amid a surge of investment in fusion energy, with CFS recently securing $863 million in funding from investors including Nvidia, as detailed in the same Japan Times article. The company’s technology revolves around high-temperature superconductors to create compact tokamaks, which could generate electricity from fusion reactions mimicking the sun’s power. Japan, with its history of energy innovation and post-Fukushima caution toward traditional nuclear fission, sees fusion as a safer, cleaner alternative to meet rising demands from data centers and manufacturing.

Investment Surge and Strategic Partnerships

The influx of capital underscores investor confidence in fusion’s viability. CFS’s funding round, highlighted in Bloomberg, positions the firm to accelerate development, potentially outpacing competitors. In Japan, a consortium of 12 companies, including Mitsubishi Corporation and Kansai Electric Power, has invested in CFS, marking the first such involvement from Japanese firms, as reported by Digitimes. This collaboration aims to import technical know-how for domestic commercialization.

For industry insiders, this partnership highlights the interplay between U.S. innovation and Japanese industrial might. Japan’s government has been proactive in fusion, evidenced by the JT-60SA tokamak, a joint EU-Japan project that began operations in 2023, according to the European Commission. CFS’s entry could build on this foundation, integrating American magnet technology with Japan’s precision engineering.

Technological Hurdles and Market Potential

Yet, challenges remain in scaling fusion from experimental to commercial stages. CFS’s approach promises net energy gain, but skeptics point to historical delays in the field. As Reuters noted in coverage of a U.S.-Japan fusion partnership announced earlier this year, bilateral efforts are crucial for overcoming plasma stability and material durability issues.

Japan’s energy needs, driven by AI and electrification, make it an ideal testing ground. A recent Interesting Engineering article discussed Japan’s consideration of new fission reactors, but fusion offers a zero-waste, abundant fuel option using seawater-derived deuterium. CFS executives, per The Japan Times, emphasize regulatory alignment and site selection as next steps.

Global Implications for Energy Transition

The broader implications extend to international energy security. With fusion potentially providing baseload power without greenhouse emissions, CFS’s Japan plans could inspire similar deployments elsewhere. Neutron Bytes reported on CFS’s funding, noting its role in advancing tritium fuel cycles alongside partners like General Atomics.

For insiders, this development signals a maturing fusion sector, where private ventures like CFS are bridging lab breakthroughs to real-world applications.

That's because a Los Alamos National Laboratory-led team has tapped the power of ""THOR,"" according to a news release.

And while there isn't a hammer-wielding god involved, there is potential for plenty of cleaner power thanks to the Thinned Hohlraum Optimization for Radflow diagnostic device. The team was able to achieve ignition through a self-contained feedback loop called burning plasma. It's part of the way our sun continues to burn, according to the release and other government data.

It's also extremely hard to sustain, making fusion energy an as-yet unrealized power source on Earth. But if experts can make a key breakthrough, the reaction could provide nearly unlimited energy. Unlike common fission reactors, fusion doesn't produce long-lasting nuclear waste or carry meltdown risks. Fusion combines atoms to create energy, while fission splits them, according to the Department of Energy.

Powerful lasers creating astounding heat are needed to create ignition, something the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory first achieved in 2022. The extreme settings provide them with a setting to observe how materials respond to severe plasma conditions. And THOR is essentially a better window to look through, per the summary.

As lasers are fired at a gold-coated cylinder holding fusion fuel, a ""bath"" of X-rays is produced that is needed to create ignition. As part of the THOR process, the cylinder, known as a hohlraum, includes ""windows"" that allow some of the X-rays to escape. This technique gives the scientists another look at how materials are reacting to high heat and radiation, according to the release.

""We pulled this off in less than a year because of everyone's commitment. We moved fast and we moved together, showing what can happen when the whole team is aligned and all-in,"" THOR project lead Ryan Lester, a physicist, said.

It's an exciting benchmark in the effort for sustainable fusion energy, as the power comes without heat-trapping air pollution that the World Health Organization said is a health problem for almost everyone on Earth. Indoor and outdoor dirty air is linked to 7 million premature deaths a year, per the WHO. A study has even associated it with dementia risks.

However, there are also nuclear pitfalls. The Los Alamos news release mentioned that the information they are gathering is also of value for weapons development. Experts and advocates on both sides continue to debate the repercussions of nuclear waste, meltdown risks, and the prospect of limitless, cleaner power.

Fission energy, powering 54 plants stateside, is still being developed as growing data center electricity demand strains the power grid.

For its part, fusion could resolve many of the concerns. The THOR project was completed in conjunction with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the National Ignition Facility. The experts plan to continue refining the diagnostic system, per the release.

""This is a game-changing breakthrough,"" physicist Joseph Smidt said.

Solar energy is another clean energy option that is among the cheapest — second to wind — to develop, according to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It doesn't provide weapons-related data or create radioactive waste, either.

On a continent where more than 300 million people lack access to safe drinking water, green hydrogen risks becoming water plunder disguised in green labels.","Energy that is hailed as clean demands a vital resource that is missing: water.

The world applauds green hydrogen as the clean energy that will save the planet. It is sold as the invisible gold of the twenty-first century. But there is a truth buried under the propaganda. To produce every kilo of hydrogen, liters and liters of pure water are needed. On a planet already suffering historic droughts, where millions of people lack drinking water, that promise turns into a threat.

The geopolitics of the twenty-first century will not only revolve around minerals and fuels. It will also revolve around water. The same countries that are pushing green hydrogen megaprojects are the ones watching their people dry up. Chile announces plants in Atacama, one of the driest deserts in the world. Namibia and Mauritania hand over land for gigantic projects while their populations still carry buckets of water. Saudi Arabia builds complexes with desalination plants that generate more brine than energy.

The contradiction is brutal. They speak of clean energy, but they hide the water cost. They proclaim the fight against climate change, but they risk deepening the water crisis. What should be a path toward sustainability can become a new form of plunder. Green hydrogen not only divides the world into producers and buyers. It also divides it between those who will have water to live and those who will give up theirs to export molecules.

The water cost of hydrogen

Green hydrogen is produced by electrolysis. A process that splits water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen using renewable electricity. The equation is simple in theory, but brutal in practice. To produce one kilo of hydrogen, between nine and twelve liters of pure water are needed, free of salts and minerals. That water must be treated and demineralized before entering the electrolyzers, which makes the process even more expensive.

The numbers escalate at industrial scale. The International Energy Agency estimates that if the world produces the 530 million tons of green hydrogen projected for 2050, more than five billion cubic meters of water per year will be required, equivalent to the annual consumption of a nation of one hundred million people. In other words, the energy transition based on hydrogen demands a new sacrifice: turning water into exportable energy.

The contradiction is obvious. Projects rise in arid regions where water is scarcest. Chile announces complexes in Atacama and Magallanes. Namibia and Mauritania promise massive exports from the desert. Saudi Arabia pushes its futuristic city Neom based on hydrogen, with desalination plants that generate millions of tons of brine discharged into the sea. They call it progress, but for local communities it is another form of dispossession.

The water cost of green hydrogen opens a new political question. Should water be used to feed electrolyzers or to secure life and agriculture? What right do corporations have to drain rivers and aquifers in the name of an energy that will not even remain in producing countries? At its core, green hydrogen risks being clean only in appearance. Clean in Europe’s and Asia’s carbon accounts, but dirty in the thirst it leaves behind.

Latin America: green energy in dry lands

Latin America is presented as the new Saudi Arabia of green hydrogen. Governments and corporations announce gigantic projects that promise billion-dollar exports to Europe and Asia. But behind the discourse of progress lies a paradox: many of these megaprojects are being built in territories where water is scarce and where millions of people still lack access to the most basic resource.

Chile leads the regional map. In Magallanes, world-scale plants are planned to produce green ammonia and export it to Germany and Japan. In Atacama, the driest desert on the planet, solar parks are being built to power electrolyzers that require thousands of cubic meters of pure water every day. The same country where more than 400,000 people suffer chronic water scarcity is handing over its water to corporations that will generate energy for European ships.

Argentina is not far behind. In Río Negro, the Australian company Fortescue is projecting an $8.4 billion investment to install a green hydrogen hub that will need water resources in a province already under stress. Patagonia, with its wind potential, is turning into the epicenter of a clean energy that risks drying up agricultural valleys.

Brazil and Mexico are moving forward with pilot projects in Ceará, Bahia, and Yucatán—regions where water is limited and contested between human consumption, agriculture, and mining. Figures projected by the International Energy Agency indicate that producing just one million tons of green hydrogen per year consumes more than nine million cubic meters of water, enough to supply a medium-sized city.

The warning is clear. Latin America is giving up water and territory to produce energy it will not consume. Green hydrogen is sold as the key to the future, but in practice it threatens to repeat the history of plunder: cheap raw materials for the north and thirst for the south.

Africa: the desert as a testing ground

Africa is the new laboratory of green hydrogen. In the midst of energy poverty and lack of drinking water, megaprojects are rising that promise to save the planet but may condemn local communities. Namibia is the most brutal example. There, the company Hyphen Energy is pushing a $10 billion complex on the southern coast, aimed at exporting green ammonia to Germany and the Netherlands. The project will use desalinated water, but that desalination will generate tons of brine discharged into the ocean, altering already fragile marine ecosystems.

Mauritania has become the other epicenter. The consortium CWP Global is planning a $40 billion megaproject, one of the largest in the world, also geared toward exports to Europe. The Mauritanian desert, where communities survive with minimal water and electricity, will be converted into an energy extraction zone to supply foreign trains and ships. The paradox repeats itself: countries where more than 40 percent of the population lacks regular access to electricity are giving up their water resources to produce energy they will not consume.

South Africa and Morocco have joined the race. Pretoria announced a hydrogen corridor in Northern Cape, while Rabat signed agreements with the European Union and Germany to be a key supplier in the next decade. Both rely on desalination to sustain production. That technology raises the cost of hydrogen and generates a hidden problem: millions of tons of brine dumped into the sea, impacting fisheries and biodiversity.

The figures are stark. Producing one million tons of green hydrogen per year requires more than nine million cubic meters of water. Namibia, Mauritania, and Morocco aim to multiply that figure tenfold over the next twenty years. On a continent where more than 300 million people lack access to safe drinking water, green hydrogen risks becoming water plunder disguised in green labels.

Asia and the Middle East: water or energy

Asia and the Middle East concentrate the paradox of green hydrogen at its most extreme. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates announce gigantic hydrogen plants in the middle of the desert. The flagship project is Neom, the futuristic Saudi city presented as a model of sustainability, which includes the installation of one of the largest hydrogen plants on the planet. Production depends on massive desalination, a process that requires additional energy and discharges millions of tons of highly polluting brine into the Red Sea. Clean energy in theory, but with a toxic environmental trail.

India faces an even more direct dilemma. The government launched a national green hydrogen plan with the goal of producing five million tons annually by 2030. However, much of that production would be located in the arid regions of Rajasthan and Gujarat, where water is already insufficient for agriculture and human consumption. One kilo of hydrogen means ten liters less of water for farmers already enduring chronic droughts. In a country with more than 100 million people without secure access to drinking water, hydrogen can become more of a threat than a solution.

China is also betting big. Its hydrogen megaprojects are concentrated in the north, in areas such as Inner Mongolia, rich in wind and solar power but poor in water. The challenge is obvious: while China leads in electrolyzers, it must guarantee water to sustain large-scale production. The risk is that the energy meant to decarbonize the global economy will end up worsening local water stress.

The figures don’t lie. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, 60 percent of green hydrogen projects in Asia and the Middle East are located in regions with high or extreme water stress. The question becomes unavoidable: what is worth more—water for life, or water turned into fuel for global trade?

Potential conflicts

Green hydrogen is not only an energy bet, it can also become a new motive for water wars. Where historical tensions already exist, the arrival of HV megaprojects threatens to deepen conflicts. The Nile River is a clear example. Egypt, Sudan, and Ethiopia have spent years disputing control of the Grand Renaissance Dam. If hydrogen production is added in Ethiopia and Sudan, the waters of the Nile will become fuel for export and not a vital resource for 150 million people.

The Indus River in Asia faces a similar situation. India and Pakistan dispute its flow under a fragile sharing agreement. India’s decision to push hydrogen projects in arid regions using Indus water could ignite a new conflict front. The same is happening in the Amazon, where there is already talk of exploring HV projects in Brazil and Peru, in a basin that holds 20 percent of the world’s freshwater and already suffers from deforestation and pollution. Turning that river into an energy input for export would be repeating plunder under another guise.

The numbers put the contradiction in black and white. More than 400 million Africans and 100 million Asians today lack secure access to drinking water. Producing one million tons of green hydrogen per year consumes more than nine million cubic meters of water, enough to supply a city of half a million inhabitants for a year. Water colonialism is taking hold in silence. The north buys green molecules, and the south gives up the water it needs to live. They call it energy transition, but it smells like the same old story: exporting life and staying with thirst.

Alternatives and solutions

Green hydrogen does not have to be a water plunder. There are technological and political alternatives that could prevent the energy of the future from being built on the thirst of the people.

The first option is to look to the sea. New electrolyzers designed to operate directly with seawater reduce dependence on freshwater sources. The technology is still expensive, but it is advancing quickly. Researchers in China and Australia have already tested prototypes that produce hydrogen without the need for desalination.

The second alternative is the reuse of wastewater. Cities that today dump millions of liters of treated water into the sea could redirect part of that flow to hydrogen production. Germany and Japan are already developing pilots along these lines. The cost is lower than desalination and avoids tensions with agriculture and human consumption.

The third solution is not technical but political. Water justice must be a principle of the energy transition. No hydrogen project should advance if it compromises access to drinking water for local communities. The priority must be clear: life first, export second.

The numbers show viability. Using wastewater could cover up to 15 percent of the projected water demand for hydrogen by 2030. Direct seawater electrolysis could reduce operating costs by 20 percent if scaled up industrially. These are figures that prove this is not science fiction, but political will and real investment.

The dilemma is clear. Hydrogen can be the excuse to deepen water colonialism, or it can be the impulse for a just and sustainable energy transition. It all depends on who sets the rules: the banks and corporations of the north, or the peoples who put their water at stake.

Green hydrogen is announced as the key to a clean future. But behind every electrolyzer beat the rivers, the aquifers, and the communities that feed it. There will be no just transition if water becomes a commodity to produce molecules destined to light up distant cities while entire peoples continue carrying jugs just to drink.

The history of energy colonialism may repeat itself in another disguise. First it was gold, then oil, now it may be water turned into hydrogen. The discourse changes, the logic remains. The south delivers what is vital, the north keeps the benefit. They call it green energy, but it may end up being blue plunder, hidden in liters of water evaporated in silence.

And yet, not everything is written. Technologies exist that can use seawater and urban waste. Social movements already raise their voices to demand water justice. Governments could still put sovereignty above contracts signed on their knees. Hope is not naivety, it is memory. The peoples who survived past colonialism know they can resist the colonialism of the future.

Green hydrogen can be a mirage or a real opportunity. It can dry out the planet or give it a breath. The decision is not in tanks or ports. It is in the hands of those who must choose between selling the water of life or defending it as a human right.

And that choice will define whether the energy of tomorrow will be liberation or condemnation.

The EV revolution has taken a huge hit since the failed US president brought his team of fossil fuel champions to Washington. Emissions rules? Gone. EV tax credits? Gone. Funding for EV chargers? Gone — although, most of it was later restored. EVs are now viewed as part of the “green new scam” touted by America’s Dear Leader and his jock-sniffing coterie of sycophants.

It’s not just the US that is affected. The malevolence against electric cars in the US has been a disaster for foreign automakers. Volkswagen this week announced it will furlough 160 employees at its ID.4 factory in Chattanooga, Tennessee, as demand for the car has evaporated. Although everyone in the industry expects EV sales to break records in September as buyers race to get their orders in before September 30, which is when the federal tax incentive ends, after that, sales of electric cars are expected to plummet, and how long will it be before Americans begin to embrace them again is a matter of intense speculation.

Canada Ditches EV Mandate

This week, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney rescinded a policy put in place by his predecessor that would require automakers in Canada to sell a certain percentage of electric cars beginning next year. According to Bloomberg, the move is designed to support domestic manufacturers whose business has been upended by the cockamamie tariff wars initiated by Washington.

Under the Trudeau plan, 20 percent of new cars sold in Canada in 2026 would need to be electric, rising to 100 percent by the end of 2035. “These targets were made up by the government, not based on any sound assessment of real market dynamics,” Brian Kingston, CEO of the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers’ Association, said in an interview in August.

An Engine For All Seasons

So, what are manufacturers who have designed battery electric cars supposed to do now that the bloom is off the EV rose? Horse Powertrain, a joint venture between Renault and Geely, says it has the answer — an ultra-compact engine and integrated generator it says can be retrofitted to any EV to help calm the fears of customers who are still freaked out by charging anxiety.

A year ago, Horse Powertrain introduced a compact electric motor that can be added to virtually any conventional car to boost its efficiency. Next week at the IAA auto show in Munich, if you stop by booth B40 in hall A2, you can see its latest creation.

That may seem like a stretch to most of us. The engine may be diminutive, but there are things like gas tanks and exhaust systems that need to be fitted as well. Horse Powertrain suggests those niggling issue can be overcome. Perhaps they can.

The company slyly suggests its C15 engine is small enough to fit into a briefcase. Actually, it measures 19.7 x 21.7 x 11 inches (50 x 55 x 28 cm). Perhaps briefcases are bigger in Europe and China than they are in the US, but give the company credit for some creative marketing. If you call it a suitcase engine, everyone will want to see it, which is pretty much the point of all marketing.

In a press release, the company says “the C15 integrates an engine, generator, and inverter into a unit compact enough to be fitted within existing battery electric vehicle (BEV) platforms with little to no modification. This allows OEMs to easily and efficiently convert a BEV platform into a range extended EV (REEV), allowing them to expand their product line-ups to meet local market demands.”

Matias Giannini, CEO of Horse Powertrain, said: “Range extended EVs are the fastest-growing powertrain category in many global markets. The Horse C15 range extender solution offers OEMs a straightforward and cost effective way to tap into this opportunity, and adapt their native BEV platforms into REEVs.

“We believe demand for REEVs will continue to grow. Horse C15 will play a critical role in this transition, as one of the market’s most efficient and flexible REEV solutions to date. It also underlines our commitment and ability to support OEMs in delivering a full range of EVs, hybrids, and combustion platforms.”

The C15 has been designed for Euro 7 compliance, including China 7 and SULEV 20. It will be available in naturally aspirated form for B and C segment vehicles, with maximum engine power of up to 70 kW (93 hp). For larger D segment vehicles and commercial vehicles, the addition of a turbocharger increases power output up to 120 kW (161 hp).

The little engine is able to run on gasoline, ethanol or methanol flex fuels, and synthetic fuels. In all applications, the range extender maintains the charge level of the battery used to power the drive motor of an EV. By adding the C15 to an existing model, the manufacturer can elect to use a smaller battery, which could lower the price of the vehicle and make it more appealing to customers.

By definition, the C15 never powers the vehicle’s wheels directly, which allows it to operate as efficiently as possible to minimize fuel consumption and emissions, while keeping noise, vibration, and harshness to a minimum.

Splitting The Difference

Writing in New Atlas, C.C. Weiss summed up the Horse Powertrain phenomenon succinctly. “Horse has always struck us as a company just over the right side of the thin wire fence dividing genius from insanity. Had it debuted a couple of years earlier, when the automotive world had its head down toward going 110% all-in on electric vehicles, it would have struck us as a bit insane, or at least too little, too late.

“But having ramped up at a time when governments and automakers worldwide are rethinking those EV plans and timelines, it seems to be perfectly positioned for a renaissance in hybrid technology. For now, at least.”

We agree. The debate about hybrid, plug-in hybrid, series vs parallel, extended range, and battery electric cars has been raging for nearly 15 years. We confess that here at CleanTechnica, most of us have always laughed at manufacturers who couldn’t make up their minds about what direction the market — and government polices — were likely to go in the future, and so designed their platforms to accept a variety of powertrains.

We thought that was nuts because anyone with more than a 4th grade education could see that EVs were the future. By relying on such multi-dimensional chassis configurations, they are denying their customers some of the important benefits of an EV, such as more interior space for people and stuff, more “cab forward” designs, and worst of all — no frunk!

But as things have developed, the companies that allowed themselves such flexibility may be better positioned for the markets of today. Tomorrow can always take care of itself, we suppose.

It pains us to admit we might have gotten too far out over our skis when it comes to promoting the EV revolution and wishing the S curve would hurry up to work its magic. The biggest factor, of course, other than the whiplash of changes in policy, is that in many places — particularly in the US — EV prices are still significantly higher than they are for conventional cars. That has to change before the EV revolution becomes unstoppable.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/C15-top.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 01:58:53.026868

The World Bank is not financing the project outright.
The World Bank is providing a mix of support including concessional funding for legal and environmental issues and transmission lines, partial risk guarantees and political risk insurance.
In Congo, the World Bank is backing the huge Inga 3 project that could also send electricity to South Africa, Nigeria and others.","SIDUAVA, Mozambique -- Hermínio Guambe used to cut hair in a tiny barbershop with no electricity in his village outside Mozambique’s capital. The arrival of power changed everything.

The 48-year-old now uses hair dryers. The village pharmacy stocks vital medicines requiring refrigeration. More jobs were created as trading and transport picked up.

“These are the kinds of businesses that drive economies,” World Bank President Ajay Banga said in an interview with The Associated Press during a July visit to tour electrification projects and meet entrepreneurs like Guambe. “Electricity isn’t just light, it’s a chance.”

Mozambique has won World Bank backing for the $6 billion Mphanda Nkuwa hydroelectric plant, southern Africa’s biggest such project in 50 years.

Mozambique, one of the world’s poorest countries by per capita income, aims to connect all of its 33 million mostly rural citizens to electricity by 2030, largely through renewable energy from hydroelectric, solar and other sources.

The challenge is similar in much of sub-Saharan Africa, home to 85% of the global population living without power, according to the World Bank.

Electricity access in Mozambique has nearly doubled from 31% in 2018 to 60% in 2024. The state-run energy supplier Electricidade de Moçambique, or EDM, says it connected 563,000 homes in 2024 and plans to reach 600,000 this year.

“Mozambique has the resources, gas, hydro, solar, and it’s already the biggest supplier of excess power to southern Africa,” Banga said.

His visit came with fanfare, and political undertones. President Daniel Chapo, who took office after a disputed 2024 election, raised his fist to cheering crowds.

Located 60 kilometers (37 miles) downstream from the even larger Cahora Bassa hydroelectric dam along the Zambezi river, the Mphanda Nkuwa plant is expected to generate 1,500 megawatts when it begins operations in 2031. That will help a region facing a 10,000-megawatt deficit that keeps millions from accessing power.

The World Bank is not financing the project outright.

Global energy firm TotalEnergies, French utility Électricité de France and Mozambique’s Hidroeléctrica de Cahora Bassa will develop the plant. The World Bank is providing a mix of support including concessional funding for legal and environmental issues and transmission lines, partial risk guarantees and political risk insurance.

Banga said this approach in Africa aims to move away from reliance on donors for high-impact projects. It coincided with a global shift in development funding. With the Trump administration dismantling the U.S. Agency for International Development, multilateral lenders like the World Bank are stepping in, often emphasizing private sector–led growth.

“Many shareholders, even in Europe, are reducing their overseas development assistance budgets because they have to divert the money to defense and their own needs. This is the way it is,” Banga said.

Mphanda Nkuwa could also help Mozambique earn critical foreign exchange through exports of electricity to neighbors like South Africa and Zimbabwe. It is among several large hydropower projects aiming to reshape Africa’s energy future.

Ethiopia is preparing to inaugurate its $4 billion Grand Renaissance Dam, which will eventually generate over 5,000 megawatts, doubling the nation’s power output despite fierce opposition from Egypt. In Congo, the World Bank is backing the huge Inga 3 project that could also send electricity to South Africa, Nigeria and others.

Yet hydropower — the world’s largest source of renewable electricity — remains mostly untapped in Africa, with the World Bank and the International Hydropower Association estimating around 90% of capacity is still unused.

And building a mega-dam is only part of the challenge in Mozambique.

“Our country is quite big, and it’s not so easy to go everywhere with the national grid,” said EDM chairman Joaquim Ou-Chim. “So it’s off-grid solutions, mainly driven by solar.”

About 10% of electricity access in Mozambique comes from off-grid projects, and more are being rolled out.

Evaristo Cumbane, an energy consultant based in Maputo, said large projects like Cahora Bassa and Mphanda Nkuwa are important but stressed the need for smaller, local sources of energy.

“We are talking about plenty of rivers, plenty of sunshine, plenty of wind, plenty of coastlines,” he said, adding that “the real Mozambique is in rural, remote areas.”

Cumbane also urged caution over Mozambique’s growing debt burden. Public debt rose to about $17 billion in the first quarter of 2025. A record $2.1 billion was spent in 2023 in debt service, according to the Finance Ministry.

“The World Bank is not a godfather, it is not god. The guy is here on business. These are not donations,” he said.

It was not clear how much new debt is involved in the Mphanda Nkuwa hydroelectric project. Banga said the project’s final cost is yet to be determined but estimated $5 billion to $6 billion.

Mozambique’s path has been complicated. Since gaining independence from Portugal in 1975, it has seen civil war, flare-ups of fighting following a peace deal and an ongoing Islamist insurgency in the north that forced TotalEnergies to halt a $20 billion gas project, though it hopes to restart operations.

But for Mozambicans, Guambe’s buzzing barbershop is proof of what’s possible when power reaches the people.

In another impoverished neighborhood outside Maputo visited by Banga, 38-year-old Aurélio Arlindo has been unemployed for years and lives without electricity. But new power poles signal hope.

“It’s really coming. I am just waiting,” he said, and he hopes to open a cold drinks stall.

The mirrors tilt to varying degrees throughout the day, tracking the sunrays and projecting them onto a tower. The tower houses a receiver that absorbs intense heat, boils water and produces high-pressure steam. This is then converted into 50 megawatts of electricity — enough to power over 40,000 households for 24 hours.

The KHI Solar One project is one of many looking to add renewable energy to South Africa's power grid, which is heavily reliant on coal-fired power stations.

However, as hundreds of delegates prepare to gather in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa for the Africa Climate Summit this week, it's clear that many more such projects are needed to bring electricity to millions of people on the continent who need it and to fight the impacts of climate change.

Africa's energy needs

According to the International Energy Agency, about 600 million people on a continent of some 1.5 billion live without electricity, leaving children without lights to study at night and homes without power for appliances.

The World Bank estimates that Central and West Africa have some of the world’s lowest electrification rates. In West Africa, where 220 million people have no electricity, the electrification rate is as low as 8%.

The lack of electricity also limits the continent's access to quality health care, education and economic growth brought about by a sufficient and uninterrupted power supply.

The continent's embracing of renewable energy has been slow when compared to more developed economies like China, European countries and the U.S., which account for 80% of renewable power capacity installed worldwide.

Only 1.5% of installed renewable power capacity is in Africa.

Renewable energy potential in Africa

According to a report by the United Nations released in July, Africa has 60% of the world's best solar resources with the continent's deserts and warm climate creating massive potential for solar projects.

Despite this, Africa received just 2% of global clean energy investments in 2024.

At a climate summit in January this year, African leaders committed to bringing renewable energy capacity in Africa to 300 gigawatts by 2030. That amount of power equals the output of about 114 large power stations — enough to power a large city or a small country. Meanwhile, the International Renewable Energy Agency projects that 90% of Africa's power could be generated from renewables including solar by 2050.

This includes other renewable energy sources besides solar, with countries like South Africa opting for an energy mix that includes hydropower and wind energy.

China's rising solar exports to Africa

Some recent analysis of Chinese export data has shown that exports of solar panels to Africa have increased significantly over the last 12 months.

A report by energy think tank Ember notes that imports from China rose 60% in the last year to 15,032 megawatts, with 20 African countries setting a record for imports of solar panels in a 12-month period.

While the surge in solar panels had previously been buoyed by imports by South Africa, which went through years of power blackouts due to a lengthy electricity crisis, imports of solar panels from outside of South Africa tripled in the last 12 months.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/HuQ.Z1jYEg.sNIwg1x2a5g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/ddaa0e404cd17be1dbd648bb10e4766d,N,,2025-09-07 07:02:56.504986

Along with Jackson County, the first awardee, Spencer will be on the receiving end of a program that provides local governments with private funding to address environmental barriers, preparing rail-served properties for new industrial uses that attract investment and create lasting jobs.

“Not every job-creating site begins as a blank slate,” said Carl Warren, NCRR president and CEO. “We help communities overcome early redevelopment hurdles, unlocking the potential of rail-served properties.”

Brownfields are sites hindered by environmental concerns that can complicate redevelopment. NCRR’s program helps communities take critical, initial steps toward entry into the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (NCDEQ) Brownfields Program, positioning sites for remediation, industrial investment and job creation.

“NCRR is helping communities turn yesterday’s challenges into tomorrow’s opportunities by preparing rail-served sites for new industry and lasting jobs,” said Trish Haver, NCRR’s chief commercial officer.

Spencer plans to facilitate transformation of a property at 2555 North U.S. Highway 29, once a textile dyeing and finishing facility, into a rail-accessible industrial site, attracting investment and expanding job opportunities. NCRR awarded the municipality $99,800 in grant funding, with a 20-percent match, or nearly $20,000, provided by Samet Corporation.

“This funding helps us partner with property owners and redevelopment professionals to ready a site that has remained inactive and largely untouched for roughly 25 years,” Spencer Town Manager Peter Franzese said. “By preparing this property for industrial use, we hope to identify new possibilities for investment and quality jobs in our community, while addressing a site that has long stood as a reminder of one of North Carolina’s most significant economic challenges.”

Jackson County received $92,000 to assess a 42-acre former sawmill site at 3636 Skyland Drive in Sylva which closed in early 2024. The county will provide a 20-percent match toward the $115,000 project, which will fund environmental assessment and remediation planning. The goal is to repurpose the property for future industrial use.

“This project allows Jackson County to transform a recently closed sawmill into new opportunities for our people and our future,” said Kevin King, Jackson County manager. “With NCRR’s support, we are preparing the site for industry, rail access and workforce training. These investments will create good jobs and long-term prosperity for families across Western North Carolina.”

To ensure long-term impact, the railroad company requires that supported sites:

• Enter the NCDEQ Brownfields Program as part of redevelopment planning.

• Use grant funds within two years of the award for on-site remediation.

• Secure a company that will move at least 40 rail cars annually for five years; if not, partial repayment may be required.

For investors, the U.S. natural gas sector presents a compelling case study in how strategic infrastructure development and regional production shifts can create long-term value.

Production Growth and Regional Drivers

U.S. dry natural gas production has defied expectations of decline, surging to 107.4 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) in June 2025—a 4.5% increase compared to June 2024 and the highest monthly output since 1973 [1]. This growth is underpinned by robust performance in key shale basins. The Permian Basin, for instance, added 2 Bcf/d in 2025 alone, while the Haynesville and Appalachia regions each contributed an additional 0.9 Bcf/d [2]. These gains reflect a strategic reallocation of drilling rigs to gas-rich plays, with the Haynesville region seeing an 18% increase in active rigs between April and August 2025 [2].

The EIA forecasts that 2025 production will average 106 Bcf/d, a 3% rise from 2024 levels, with growth sustained by new infrastructure. The Louisiana Energy Gateway pipeline, set to expand takeaway capacity in the Haynesville region, and LNG export projects like Golden Pass and Plaquemines LNG Phase 2 are critical to unlocking future output [2].

Demand Resilience and Export Dynamics

Despite flat domestic consumption, U.S. natural gas demand remains resilient due to its role in power generation and industrial processes. However, the true driver of demand is the global LNG market. Exports are projected to rise by 2 Bcf/d in 2025–2026, tightening supply-demand balances and supporting price stability [2]. This trend is amplified by Europe’s continued reliance on U.S. LNG to replace Russian imports and Asia’s seasonal demand spikes, particularly in Japan and South Korea.

Price Resilience and Investment Implications

Natural gas prices have exhibited remarkable seasonal resilience, with the Henry Hub price averaging $3.60 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in the second half of 2025 and projected to climb to $4.30/MMBtu in 2026 [2]. This upward trajectory is fueled by infrastructure bottlenecks—such as constrained takeaway capacity in the Permian Basin—and the ramp-up of LNG export facilities. For investors, this volatility underscores opportunities in midstream assets, such as pipelines and processing facilities, which are essential to monetizing production gains.

Strategic Investment Opportunities

Shale Plays and Drilling Efficiency: The Permian, Haynesville, and Appalachia basins remain high-conviction areas. The Permian’s associated gas production, driven by record crude oil output, is expected to add 11.5 Bcf/d in 2025 [4]. Operators with strong acreage in these regions and access to capital-efficient drilling technologies will outperform.

Midstream Infrastructure: Projects like the Matterhorn Express Pipeline and Louisiana Energy Gateway are critical to alleviating bottlenecks and enabling production growth. These assets offer stable cash flows and long-term value as they connect supply hubs to export terminals.

LNG Export Facilities: With global demand for cleaner energy intensifying, new LNG terminals will become pivotal. The EIA estimates that U.S. LNG exports could reach 12 Bcf/d by 2026, creating a tailwind for companies involved in terminal construction and operations [2].

Conclusion

The U.S. natural gas market is undergoing a transformation, characterized by production growth, infrastructure innovation, and export-driven demand. While 2026 may see production stabilize, the long-term outlook—projected to reach 120 Bcf/d by 2040—remains bullish [5].

The bigger problem is that, according to the Parliamentary Budget Office, Canada’s federal and provincial governments – mainly Ontario and Quebec – have earmarked up to $52.5 billion to subsidize 13 major Electric Vehicle supply chain projects, 14% more than the $46.1 billion the EV industry in Canada is spending on itself.

While most of these subsidies have yet to be paid, these governments have a huge financial stake of taxpayers’ money in the eventual success of the EV industry, with some projects already delayed because of lower-than-expected EV sales due to higher costs to consumers compared to internal combustion engine vehicles, a shortage of public charging stations and reduced range in cold weather.

Canada to stall electric vehicle rules as Carney seeks to boost auto sector

Poilievre accuses PM of flip-flopping on gas, diesel car ban

ELBOWS DOWN: Carney sees popularity drop, Tories still leading Liberals

When Carney announced his decision to cancel the 20% mandate for new EV sales in 2026 on Friday, he said the government will conduct a 60-day review of future mandates of 60% of new car sales being EVs by 2030 and 100% by 2035.

He said this will “consider potential amendments to the annual sales targets,” as well as “explore possible additional flexibilities” to ensure government programs promoting EV sales “reflect market realities, remain effective for Canadians” and do not “place undue burden on automakers.”

Aside from responding to the public’s declining interest in EVs in a time of economic uncertainty, rising unemployment and cost-of-living concerns, Carney is responding to warnings from the auto sector that its unrealistic EV mandates would further damage Canada’s struggling auto sector, which employs almost 550,000 Canadians in direct and indirect jobs.

Carney’s cancellation of the consumer carbon tax and his postponement of the 2026 EV mandate – both Justin Trudeau-era policies – while welcome, are baby steps compared to what really needs to be done.

They are only two of more than 140 federal government programs, administered by 13 federal departments and agencies, that as of 2023 had committed more than $200 billion of taxpayers’ money to address climate change.

Independent evaluations – for example, by the federal environment commissioner and PBO – have concluded they will fall far short of achieving Canada’s target of reducing industrial greenhouse gas emissions to at least 40% below 2005 levels by 2030 and net zero by 2050.

RECOMMENDED VIDEO

According to the latest government data from 2023, emissions were down only 8.5%.

The problem with these unrealistic federal targets is that they lead to unattainable and costly policies, such as the now-cancelled mandate that EVs had to reach 20% of all new car sales by next year.

A report by federal environment commissioner Jerry DeMarco following an audit of the Liberals’ Net Zero Emissions Accountability Act last year concluded the government’s lack of transparency made it impossible for the average citizen to understand, much less believe, its claim it will reduce Canada’s emissions by at least 40% below 2005 levels by 2030.

In examining a sampling of 20 government measures to reduce emissions, it found only nine were on track to achieve their goals.

Of 32 additional measures the government claimed would help boost reductions from 36.2% to at least 40% in 2030, only seven were new.

An investigation last year by Auditor General Karen Hogan of the now-disbanded, $1-billion Sustainable Development Technology Fund, which audited a sampling of the projects it funded, found 90 cases where conflict-of-interest rules were not followed in awarding $76 million worth of government contracts and 10 examples where $56 million was awarded to ineligible projects.

It’s not just the Liberal government’s EV mandates that needs to be critically assessed. So does its entire $200-billion program to address climate change.

Black Hollow Sun I delivers clean energy to Platte River Power Authority, powering thousands of local homes

SEVERANCE, Colo. — A major milestone for renewable energy in Northern Colorado arrived this week as ContourGlobal announced the start of operations at Black Hollow Sun I (BHS I), a 185-megawatt solar facility located just east of Fort Collins.

The project, the company’s first renewable facility in the United States, is delivering electricity directly to Platte River Power Authority, which serves Fort Collins, Loveland, Estes Park, and Longmont. Once complete in 2026, the two-phase Black Hollow Sun complex will be the largest photovoltaic installation in Northern Colorado, producing enough power to supply more than 73,000 homes while offsetting nearly 450,000 metric tons of CO₂ emissions annually.

Regional Impact

BHS I created a significant economic boost during construction, generating about 450 direct jobs and 250 indirect jobs for skilled workers and regional partners across Weld County and surrounding communities. With BHS II already under construction, more opportunities for local contractors, suppliers, and service providers are expected over the next year.

The clean power produced by the project will strengthen the resilience of Northern Colorado’s electric grid while supporting the community-owned Platte River Power Authority’s commitment to reliable, low-carbon energy.

Looking Ahead

ContourGlobal leaders say this development is part of a larger U.S. strategy to expand renewable energy investments. American-manufactured solar modules provided by Qcells are being used in the project, underscoring both domestic supply partnerships and long-term sustainability goals.

The company has also shown its commitment to community engagement, recently sponsoring the Severance Days Festival, strengthening ties with the growing town located just 16 miles from Fort Collins.

As new energy industries gain momentum, Inner Mongolia is also transforming its traditional coal-based sectors, shifting from simple extraction toward a more diversified and cleaner industrial system.","BEIJING, Sept. 7 (Xinhua) -- Stepping into the wind turbine assembly plant at Ming Yang Smart Energy Group's industrial park in Baotou, north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, visitors are greeted by orderly production lines and busy workers. Robotic arms swing methodically, while digital screens display real-time production data.

The park has established a complete industrial chain covering research and design, manufacturing and quality testing, according to He Changguo, manager of the firm's northern regional manufacturing center. Since 2008, wind turbines produced in the park have been deployed in more than 100 projects across China.

This facility epitomizes the accelerating pace of Inner Mongolia's green transition. Rich in coal and central to China's energy supply, the region accounted for more than one-quarter of the nation's coal output in 2024. This wealth of resources fueled decades of growth but also tied the region to high-polluting and resource-heavy industries.

In recent years, however, the nationwide low-carbon push has set the region on a new course. By tapping its abundant wind and solar resources, the region is cultivating fresh momentum for growth. Once renowned for its coal reserves and desert environment, Inner Mongolia is now dotted with vast arrays of solar panels and wind turbines.

So far, over 30 companies similar to Ming Yang Smart Energy Group, which operate full industrial chains in the new energy sector, have taken root in the region. In 2024, the added value of large-scale new energy and related industries rose by 20.1 percent compared with 2023, and that of new energy equipment manufacturers surged 42.4 percent year on year.

Gong Mingzhu, director of the regional Development and Reform Commission, said Inner Mongolia has established a comprehensive industrial chain for wind, solar, hydrogen and energy storage equipment manufacturing, effectively positioning the region to embark on a new chapter in industrial development.

As new energy industries gain momentum, Inner Mongolia is also transforming its traditional coal-based sectors, shifting from simple extraction toward a more diversified and cleaner industrial system.

A plant in Ordos exemplifies this transformation. Built by Inner Mongolia Baofeng Coal-based New Material Co., Ltd., the facility synthesizes olefins -- a class of chemical compounds serving as key raw materials for industrial products from plastics to textiles and aerospace components -- from coal.

With an annual production capacity of 3 million tonnes, this facility stands as the world's largest single-site coal-to-olefins project, according to the company.

Notably, the plant employs green hydrogen at scale to replace fossil fuels in olefin production, reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 6.3 million tonnes annually.

In 2024, Inner Mongolia's modern coal chemical industry output exceeded 100 billion yuan (about 14.07 billion U.S. dollars), while the region ranked first nationwide in both coal-to-gas and coal-to-olefin production capacities.

""Simply mining and selling coal cannot fully realize the value of Inner Mongolia's energy endowment, nor can it meet the requirements of building a modern country,"" said Hu Chengdong, deputy director of the regional energy bureau.

It is imperative for Inner Mongolia to transition from an extractive growth model, shift from factor-driven to innovation-driven development, and propel traditional industries toward higher efficiency and greater value, Hu added. ■",,N,,2025-09-06 22:02:46.662188

Tesla has proposed a new pay package for Elon Musk, potentially making him the world's first trillion-dollar executive if he meets aggressive targets, including significant increases in car production, share price, and operating profit. However, Tesla faces challenges such as declining sales in Europe due to Musk's political affiliations and intensifying competition from rivals like BYD.

The world's richest man could become its first trillionaire if Elon Musk hits a series of extremely aggressive targets for his electric car company over the next decade, according to a proposed pay package released by the company.

Tesla said in a regulatory filing Friday that it will hand Musk shares worth as much as 12% of the company in a dozen separate packages if the company meets certain performance targets, including massive increases in car production, share price and operating profit. If approved by shareholders, the new pay package could make Musk the world's first trillion dollar executive, and would mark a new level of outsized pay in a country already known for extreme compensation. But the payoff is in shares, not cash, and the goals are extreme as well.

Musk overcame doubters to turn Tesla into the world's most valuable car company, but he could face even steeper odds in hitting the targets set by the company's compensation committee - not least because of Tesla's main business of making electric vehicles is currently in a slump, in part because of Musk's foray into right-wing politics.

""It doesn't matter how much money he gets. He can't help himself,"" said Telemetry analyst Sam Abuelsamid who follows Tesla stock, which has plummeted 27% from its December high. ""And the more he talks, the more he turns off potential customers.""

To get his first package of shares equivalent to 1% of the company, Musk would have to convince investors in the stock market that Tesla is worth $2 trillion in total, double what they value it today, and also hit several other milestones. To receive all the shares offered and make him the world's first trillion-dollar man would require that market value to then rise to $8.5 trillion, double that of the world's most valuable company now, chipmaker Nvidia.

Live Events

Among other goals, sales of all Tesla vehicles would eventually also have to reach 20 million, nearly triple its entire sales since it was founded more than two decades ago. Musk would also have to vastly expand Tesla's robot and robotaxi businesses by selling a million of the bots and a million of the driverless cabs, the latter a business that has only begun to roll out its taxi service and is behind rivals, such as Waymo.

Musk would also need to remain with Tesla for at least seven and a half years to cash out on any stock, and 10 years to earn the full amount.

Musk has been one of the richest people in the world for several years. He is currently estimated to be worth more than $400 billion by Forbes magazine.

A condition of the 11th and 12th tranches of the plan includes Musk coming up with a framework for someone to succeed him as CEO.

The plunge in Tesla sales this year was largely due to blowback over Musk's affiliation with President Donald Trump. Tesla also faces intensifying competition from the big Detroit automakers and particularly from China.

Tesla sales have fallen precipitously in Europe after Musk aligned with a far-right political party in German. Sales plunged 40% in July in the 27 European Union countries compared with the year earlier even as sales overall of electric vehicle soared, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association. Meanwhile sales of Chinese rival BYD continued to climb fast, grabbing 1.1% market share of all car sales in the month versus Tesla's 0.7%.

Without a reversal of those trends, meeting the financial goals could prove especially difficult. In its most recent quarter, Tesla reported that quarterly profits plunged from $1.39 billion to $409 million. Revenue also fell and the company came up short of even the lowered expectations on Wall Street.

Investors have grown increasingly worried about the trajectory of the company after Musk had spent so much time in Washington this year, becoming one of the most prominent officials in the Trump administration in its bid to slash the size of the U.S. government.

Even bulls on the stock are not convinced the new pay incentive will keep Musk, who frequently posts on his X social media platform, from saying things that alienate potential buyers.

Said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, ""Fixing the Musk brand damage remains a work in progress."" Even so, Ives told clients, ""We believe this was the smart move by the Board as the biggest asset for Tesla is Musk.""

In January 2024, a Delaware judge threw out Musk's previous pay package, worth $44.9 billion at the time. Investors voted to restore that compensation package at Tesla's last shareholders meeting on June 13 of last year. But late last year the package was revoked for a second time. Tesla has appealed the ruling. Last month, Tesla said that it gave Musk a stock grant of $29 billion as a reward for years of ""transformative and unprecedented"" growth - despite the drop in sales and profits - and noting that the CEO hadn't been paid in years.

The EV company is set to hold its annual shareholders meeting on Nov. 6, where investors will vote on the new pay package. Musk would also receive more voting power over Tesla under the proposed plan. Musk has said that he needed more shares and control so he couldn't be ousted by shareholder activists. If he does hit all the goals, Musk would own about quarter of the company's shares, up from 13% today.

Tesla's stock nearly 3% in afternoon trading.

BP is seeking a development consent order (DCO), which is required for nationally significant infrastructure projects, for a blue hydrogen plant on the Teesworks site in Redcar.

The government had been set to make its decision by 28 August, but this has now been pushed back to 30 October to ""allow time to request further information"", according to MP Miatta Fahnbulleh.

Since BP first announced its plans, landowners South Tees Group (STG) has sought permission for the data centre.

If the hydrogen plant is approved, BP would be given the power to compulsorily purchase the land it needs.

But STG now has different plans for the site and wants to build a giant AI data centre on it instead.

Teesworks is run as a joint venture between the publicly-owned and funded South Tees Development Corporation, led by the Tees Valley Combined Authority (TVCA), and two Teesside businessmen, Martin Corney and Chris Musgrave.

The men initially owned 50% of the shares of Teesworks, but that was raised to 90% in 2021 with the remaining 10% staying in public hands.

BP has said the plant would be one of the UK's largest blue hydrogen facilities and represent more than 10% of the government's hydrogen production target by 2030.

But in a letter detailing its opposition to BP's plans, STG claimed the proposed data centre, which was approved by Redcar and Cleveland Council in the summer, was of ""critical national importance"".

For renewable energy investors, the pause raises questions about the alignment of Canada’s energy transition with its automotive policy.
A slowdown in EV sales could indirectly weaken the business case for renewable energy projects, particularly those tied to grid modernization and battery storage.
Opportunities in Alternative Clean Energy While the EV mandate pause may dampen short-term momentum for battery electric vehicles, it opens avenues for alternative clean energy pivots.
Global investment in clean energy is projected to reach $2.2 trillion in 2025, dwarfing fossil fuel investments [6].","The Canadian government’s decision to pause its 2026 electric vehicle (EV) mandate has sent ripples through the automotive and renewable energy sectors, creating a complex landscape of strategic risks and opportunities for investors. Prime Minister Mark Carney’s move, announced amid escalating trade tensions with the United States and domestic industry lobbying, suspends a policy that would have required 20% of new light-duty vehicle sales to be zero-emission by 2026. While the long-term targets of 60% by 2030 and 100% by 2035 remain intact, the immediate pause reflects a recalibration of priorities in the face of economic headwinds [1].

Strategic Risks for Investors

The automotive sector, particularly automakers and dealers, has welcomed the pause as a necessary reprieve from what they describe as unrealistic targets. The Canadian Automobile Dealers Association (CADA) has praised the decision, arguing that the mandate’s aggressive timelines risked affordability crises and supply chain disruptions [2]. However, this pause introduces uncertainty for EV infrastructure investment. According to a report by BloombergNEF, Canada’s EV charging network expansion had already lagged behind its climate goals, with only 12% of required charging stations operational as of mid-2025 [3]. The suspension of the 2026 mandate may further delay private-sector commitments to infrastructure, as companies reassess the viability of long-term projects.

For renewable energy investors, the pause raises questions about the alignment of Canada’s energy transition with its automotive policy. The federal government’s Clean Electricity Strategy, which aims to position Canada as a global leader in low-carbon technologies, relies on robust EV adoption to drive demand for clean power [4]. A slowdown in EV sales could indirectly weaken the business case for renewable energy projects, particularly those tied to grid modernization and battery storage.

Opportunities in Alternative Clean Energy

While the EV mandate pause may dampen short-term momentum for battery electric vehicles, it opens avenues for alternative clean energy pivots. The government’s 60-day review of the EV Availability Standard (EVAS) has already sparked discussions about biofuels and hydrogen as complementary technologies. For instance, the Canadian Renewable Fuels Association has lobbied for expanded incentives for biofuel integration, which could diversify the country’s decarbonization strategy [5].

Investors may also find opportunities in the renewable energy sector’s broader resilience. Global investment in clean energy is projected to reach $2.2 trillion in 2025, dwarfing fossil fuel investments [6]. Canada’s Green Bond Program, which has raised over $11 billion since 2023, continues to fund projects in solar, wind, and grid modernization, even as EV policy evolves [7]. Additionally, the federal government’s $5-billion Strategic Response Fund, designed to cushion industries against U.S. trade pressures, could redirect capital toward innovation in low-carbon manufacturing and energy storage [8].

Balancing the Scales: A Call for Flexibility

The pause underscores the need for policy flexibility in a rapidly shifting economic and technological landscape. While environmental advocates warn that the move risks undermining Canada’s climate commitments, industry leaders argue it preserves jobs and stabilizes the auto sector during a period of global uncertainty [9]. For investors, the key lies in hedging against volatility by diversifying portfolios across EV-related infrastructure, renewable energy, and alternative decarbonization technologies.

The coming months will be critical. The 60-day review of the EVAS, set to conclude by October 2025, could yield adjustments that reconcile industry needs with climate goals. In the interim, investors must navigate a landscape where policy uncertainty coexists with long-term opportunities in clean energy. As one analyst noted, “The pause isn’t a pivot—it’s a recalibration. The direction remains clear; the pace may shift” [10].",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-06 20:01:04.514454

Nio (NYSE:NIO) Stock

Chinese EV maker NIO recently reported mixed results for Q2 2025. The company missed sales estimates, as robust growth in deliveries, driven by models like the ONVO L90, was offset by the impact of price wars amid intense competition in the Chinese EV market.

Nonetheless, improved deliveries and optimism about the demand for the ES8 model have moved NIO ADRs (American Depositary Receipts) higher by 32% over the past month and more than 36% year-to-date.

Looking ahead, Nio expects Q3 vehicle deliveries in the range of 87,000 to 91,000 units, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 40.7% to 47.1%. It is worth noting that Nio’s August deliveries jumped 55% to 31,305 units, including 10,575 units of the ONVO L90, the flagship SUV of its mass-market brand.

Is NIO a Good Stock to Buy?

Reacting to the Q2 print, Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh raised the price target for NIO stock to $6 from $3.50, while reiterating a Hold rating. The 5-star analyst noted that Nio’s Q2 revenue and earnings were “modestly softer” compared to the consensus estimates. Rakesh added that Nio’s Q3 deliveries guidance of 89,000 units (at the midpoint), which missed the consensus of 91,100 units, indicates 47% sequential growth and a new lower average selling price (ASP) related to the Firefly/ONVO L90 ramps.

While better near-term EV demand for lower ASP models is helping, Rakesh argues that the expectation for exiting Q4 2025 at about 50,000 deliveries per month seems challenging. Overall, Rakesh believes that NIO is fairly valued at a price-to-sales (2026) multiple of 0.8x, as near-term revenue and delivery tailwinds are offset by margin challenges as models ramp.

Currently, Wall Street has a Moderate Buy consensus rating on Nio stock based on six Buys, five Holds, and one Sell recommendation. The average NIO stock price target of $5.95 indicates that the stock is fully valued at current levels.

XPeng (NYSE:XPEV) Stock

Let’s look at another Chinese EV maker, XPeng, which has seen its stock rally about 68% year-to-date. XPeng impressed investors with a 125% year-over-year jump in its Q2 revenue. Moreover, the company reported a 63% year-over-year reduction in its second-quarter net loss attributable to shareholders, thanks to robust deliveries and improved margins.

XPeng is benefiting from continued demand for the Mona M03 and P7+ sedans, the updated versions of the G6, G9, and X9 models, and the launch of the new G7 SUV.

Looking ahead, XPeng is confident about continued growth, backed by its focus on innovation and overseas expansion. In the first half of the year, XPEV’s overseas deliveries surpassed 18,000 units, increasing more than 200% year-over-year.

Is XPEV a Good Stock to Buy?

Recently, Jefferies analyst Alexious Lee reiterated a Buy rating on XPeng stock with a price target of $29. The 4-star analyst hosted a post-result non-deal roadshow (NDR) for XPeng in Hong Kong. Lee noted that XPeng’s first-half results beat expectations, thanks to solid margins from economies of scale.

Lee sees a clear path to profitability by the fourth quarter of this year, with the G7 and new P7 models set to start mass deliveries. Lee stated that he views XPeng’s “tech DNA as the most differentiated moat,” which is combining rapid product innovation, AI leadership, and global expansion to bolster its place as a top-tier EV maker. Further, Lee believes that the CEO’s share buyback reflects confidence in XPeng’s trajectory.

Wall Street has a Moderate Buy consensus rating on XPeng stock based on nine Buys, two Holds, and one Sell recommendation. The average XPEV stock price target of $25.75 indicates about 30% upside potential.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Stock

Tesla stock has been under pressure this year due to concerns about weak deliveries, CEO Elon Musk’s political distractions, and a lack of innovation. The stock is down 13% year-to-date and has underperformed the broader market.

However, TSLA stock has recovered 14% over the past month due to optimism about the company’s full self-driving (FSD) technology, the continued rollout of its robotaxi service, and prospects for Optimus, its humanoid robot.

Moreover, investors cheered the decision of Tesla’s board to approve a $1 trillion pay package for CEO Musk, contingent upon his achieving certain milestones.

Is TSLA Stock a Buy, Sell, or Hold?

Reacting to the board’s proposed pay package for Musk, Stifel analyst Stephen Gengaro called the milestones “very aggressive.” The 4-star analyst added that achieving these targets would “clearly require sustained executional excellence” and strong growth in auto deliveries, FSD success, robotaxi traction, and robust success of the Optimus humanoid robot.

Gengaro stated that the unprecedented pay package clearly incentivizes Musk to lead Tesla for the long term. The analyst reiterated a Buy rating with a price target of $440.

Overall, Tesla scores a Hold consensus rating based on 14 Buys, 14 Holds, and eight Sell recommendations. The average TSLA stock price target of $309 indicates about 12% downside risk from current levels.

Conclusion

Wall Street is cautiously optimistic about Nio and XPeng stocks, but sidelined on Tesla. Analysts see higher upside potential in XPEV stock than in the other two EV stocks. XPeng’s robust deliveries in recent quarters, despite intense competition in the Chinese EV market, solid execution, and improving margins support analysts’ bullish stance.",https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/shutterstock_2314812733-750x406.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 20:00:53.548918

City Council members approved a $4 million loan agreement with the Texas Water Development Board during their Aug. 26 meeting. The funds will go toward a water treatment project to remove per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, that are commonly known as “forever chemicals,” from fluid coming from the city’s southeast landfill before being treated.

The chemicals have been found in leachate, the fluid that drains from landfills or through waste, that then flows into the city’s wastewater collection system and is treated at the Village Creek Water Reclamation Facility, city spokesperson Mary Gugliuzza said in a statement.

The southeast landfill receives residential, commercial and industrial waste.

Because of the amount of PFAS collected over the last 50 years in solid waste streams, leachate often contains high concentrations of the chemicals, Gugliuzza said.

PFAS are made up of manufactured chemicals that break down very slowly and can build up in humans, animals and in the environment over time, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

Forever chemicals can be found in sources of drinking water systems, landfill and disposal sites, fire extinguishing foam, food packaging, household cleaning products, biosolids and manufacturing or chemical production plants.

Exposure to the chemicals can lead to decreased fertility, developmental effects in children, increased risk of some cancers, a weakened immune system and increased cholesterol levels, according to the EPA.

The project comes in response to the city’s requirements on industrial waste pretreatment, Gugliuzza added, which limits the amount of forever chemicals that go through wastewater treatment.

The city will not have to repay the loan as long as it meets contractual requirements, according to city documents.

Fort Worth leaders have taken up other water quality treatment projects recently to address PFAS in local water supplies.

In March, city officials joined a lawsuit alleging the Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth and chemical manufacturers contaminated Fort Worth’s water supply by using products containing forever chemicals, including fire-fighting foam.

The city sought $420 million in reimbursement for treating the water. The lawsuit, originally filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, was dismissed by Fort Worth officials.

They later joined a federal lawsuit filed out of South Carolina along with other plaintiffs against the original 12 defendants. City officials could not provide an update on the case.

Water treatment plant to supply additional millions of gallons of water

Council members also approved a contract with the state water board to fund the $180 million expansion of the Eagle Mountain Water Treatment Plant.

The plant will be able to treat an additional 35 million gallons a day after the expansion, up from the 105 million gallons a day it currently produces.

The funds, made available through the State Water Implementation Fund for Texas, offers local governments financial assistance to fund projects related to conservation and reuse, water treatment plants, reservoirs and pipelines.

The expansion project comes in response to rapid development and population growth.

Fort Worth has 1 million residents. Officials expect to add 550,000 more residents by 2045 throughout the city’s service areas, water utility director Chris Harder said in a Feb. 18 meeting.

The water department ultimately plans on expanding the Eagle Mountain plant to produce up to 200 million gallons a day, Harder said. The total expansion is projected to cost up to $250 million.

However, as gas prices fluctuate wildly, many Americans may reconsider the cars they drive and how much they drive.","Gas can get real expensive, real fast

Unless you are a proud owner of an electric car, you know that paying for gas is an expense that cannot be ignored for the life of you. It’s one of those routine costs that sneaks up on your budget every week, and depending on where you live, it can take a much bigger bite out of your paycheck than you might expect. Gas prices vary wildly across the country, but the real story isn’t just about what’s posted on the pump; it’s about how much of your paycheck is swallowed up at the gas pump.

For some drivers, it’s a manageable hit and just another part of the weekly grind. For others, it can be a heart-wrenching expense that creates a significant hole in their online banking statements. A new study looking at both pump prices and local incomes paints a clearer picture of which states’ drivers are sacrificing the most just to keep moving.

The brains at FinanceBuzz used data from the U.S. Department of Transportation, U.S. Census Bureau, and other sources like AAA to calculate and compile the U.S. states where the average driver spends the most of their monthly income on gas.

They found that drivers' gas spending and financial impact can vary significantly based on various factors like the median income in different states, the average number of miles they drive, and local gas prices. After analyzing all the data, it was determined that, on average, Americans spend 2.28% of their income on gas nationwide. However, in some states, this expenditure can be as high as 3.73%, while in others, it can drop as low as 0.76%.

Drivers in the South have it the worst at the pump

FinanceBuzz analyzed states where drivers need to budget heavily for gas, revealing that in many of these states, apart from Montana and Florida, drivers clock in over 1,000 miles per month on average. These states are often large and rural, resulting in long daily drives that can lead to higher fuel costs than their residents can afford.

Mississippi and Arkansas have the lowest median incomes, with the average driver taking home less than $50,000 a year, and New Mexico and Louisiana are close behind. Despite states like Mississippi having some of the lowest gas prices nationally, drivers in these states spend a larger chunk of their income on gas, due to the combination of low earnings and high monthly mileage.

Drivers in D.C. and on the Coasts have it the best at the pump

Unlike the states where drivers spend a large portion of their income on gas, the states where people spend a much smaller percentage of their take-home pay tend to be smaller, more urbanized areas with higher median incomes.

Drivers in Washington, D.C. may spend the smallest percentage of their incomes on gas, but FinanceBuzz notes that drivers there clock in an average of just 440 miles per month, the lowest in the country. Though it’s technically not a state, our nation’s capital is a city with a well-developed public transportation system that enables people to get around without much driving. At the same time, drivers in New York and Rhode Island drive fewer than 600 miles per month on average, largely due to the New York Metro Area’s robust transit systems and Rhode Island being the smallest U.S. state by total land area.

In addition, drivers in states on this list tend to have higher average incomes. The median income in Washington, D.C., is the highest in the country, topping $100,000, while median earnings in Massachusetts, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Maryland rank among the highest in the country.

Final thoughts

Ultimately, the link between gas prices, income, and the cars Americans drive underscores the complexity of decisions influenced by economic circumstances. Beyond our cities, the United States is a landscape where gas prices play a pivotal role in shaping the choices of a diverse range of car owners. The connection between income levels and gas prices can significantly impact what people drive and how much gas they use. However, as gas prices fluctuate wildly, many Americans may reconsider the cars they drive and how much they drive.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/autoblog_arena_articles_145/ec6b54898649cb72ac9af060130ea595,N,,2025-09-06 19:06:42.737518

Gavin Newsom, whose administration signaled strong opposition to advancing E15 ahead of a California Air Resources Board regulatory review.

In testimony at a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing last month on Assembly Bill 30, California Department of Finance officials labeled the bill as duplicative and unnecessary. A budget official pointed to the $2.3 million and 10 positions the Legislature approved this year for CARB to implement the new E15 standards, resources that will not be available until the agency completes its review.

The administration’s opposition to AB 30 centers on new costs to the California Department of Food and Agriculture for enforcing petroleum product quality standards. CDFA would need new equipment to sample and test E15, along with other expenses for maintenance and supplies. To cover those costs, the department would have to raise its motor vehicle fee beyond the current five cents per gallon. Increasing fuel fees would run counter to the administration's priority to lower gas prices.

Finance staff underscored that CARB’s review is the proper venue to determine how E15 fits within those standards.

Newsom has until Oct. 12 to decide.

Legislative Push for Lower Prices

Despite the administration’s stance, lawmakers moved the bill with rare bipartisan unity. The Assembly passed AB 30 in June without opposition, and the Senate followed with a 39-0 vote this week. With its urgency statute, the bill would take effect immediately upon the governor’s signature.

Backers have highlighted the potential for cost savings as Californians continue to pay some of the nation’s highest gas prices. A University of California, Berkeley and U.S. Naval Academy study estimated drivers could save about 20 cents per gallon, or $2.7 billion statewide, if E15 were widely available.

“California consumers cannot wait any longer,” said California Sen. Laura Richardson, D-South Bay, during the floor debate.

The bill’s author, Assemblymember David Alvarez, D-San Diego, argued it is past time for the state to join the other 49 states that already allow the blend.

Industry groups representing ethanol producers and corn growers have echoed those arguments, citing both economic and environmental benefits. Studies by CARB and UC Riverside have suggested E15 could cut tailpipe pollutants that contribute to smog and health risks.

Fuel Industry Urges Signature

The Renewable Fuels Association pressed Newsom to sign quickly.

“Many other states have already seen the benefits of E15 — healthier air, better engine performance and cost savings at the pump,” said RFA President and CEO Geoff Cooper. “Now California drivers are on the cusp of experiencing those same advantages.”

Growth Energy CEO Emily Skor pointed out that E15 is already approved for use in 96% of all light-duty vehicles on the road.

“Growth Energy has already begun to provide technical expertise in support of CARB’s still-forthcoming E15 approval rulemaking, and we encourage the state to identify other ways to maximize the impact AB 30 can have in the short-term,” said Skor. “With AB 30, the Legislature heard and responded to California drivers that demanded more affordable fuel options.”

In addition to national trade groups, California-based stakeholders have lined up behind the bill. The California Farm Bureau has endorsed AB 30, citing potential relief for rural communities facing high fuel costs. The California Fuels and Convenience Alliance, which represents the state’s retailers, has also backed the measure.

What’s Next

Newsom now faces a decision that could anger Democrats and biofuel producers alike if he issues a veto. His administration has leaned on fiscal concerns, warning that authorizing E15 before CARB’s process concludes would raise state spending — as it continues to grapple with an ongoing budget deficit — while undermining regulatory integrity.

In a special session last year, lawmakers shot down a bill to accelerate E15. Matthew Botill, a division chief at CARB, explained to the lawmakers that the agency must evaluate the potential air, water and soil impacts. That has led to several studies and literature assessments, followed by a review from an environmental policy committee, extending the process. Once that is completed, CARB can consider reopening the rulemaking, triggering several more months of hearings and administrative review.

“It's a resource-intensive process,” said Botill. “It does take time and staff on the CARB side.”

Two weeks after the bill stalled, Newsom directed CARB to accelerate its review regardless of the legislation. A month later, Alvarez echoed that message with AB 30.

Newsom's office declined Friday to comment on his plans for the bill.",https://www.agriculture.com/thmb/QI8cdkoufBfmwkc6h6GViAr8dC0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Ethanol20from20flickr-2000-0a0d81f6221043f98e22ca5a38613e31.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 19:02:44.074432

International markets are gaining significant ground due to more attractive valuations, favorable monetary policy, and a different mix of companies.
While the U.S. equities markets will remain the gold standard, there are definitive signs that global dynamics are shifting.","For much of the past decade, the U.S. stock market has dramatically outperformed its global counterparts. A major reason is the emergence and dominance of the U.S. technology sector and the rapid expansion of “mega-cap” companies such as Alphabet (Google), Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla, and Nvidia. However, there are signs that international equities may be making a comeback.

Thus far this year, international stocks are enjoying higher returns than those of U.S. firms by some measures. This phenomenon has not been limited to a single region, as numerous markets have shown impressive gains. Historically, the performance leader has swung from the U.S. to the rest of the world and back multiple times, and several key factors are contributing to this current shift.

One reason is the high values of U.S. stocks, particularly in the technology sector, which have been trading at a significant premium compared to international equities. Price-to-earnings ratios for U.S. stocks have been higher for quite a while. In fact, the valuation gap is the widest that it has been in decades. As a result, other major markets are becoming a more attractive proposition for value-seeking investors.

In addition, many countries began easing up on monetary policy before the United States. The Federal Reserve has not yet reduced interest rates this year (following three moves in 2024), while central banks elsewhere (particularly in Europe) have implemented cuts. Much of this pattern stems from the potential inflationary effects of tariffs and the resilience of domestic growth. Nonetheless, this approach has put U.S. economic prospects and corporate earnings at a comparative disadvantage.

Another factor is that, while U.S. market strength has been highly concentrated in relatively few technology-oriented stocks, other sectors, such as financials and industrials, are now showing some momentum. These segments are more heavily represented in international markets, thus enhancing the attractiveness of global investments.

Despite the performance of international stocks, investors have been slow to shift until recently. There is growing acknowledgment of the risks associated with concentration in the U.S. market due to high valuations and the importance of a small number of firms to overall returns. Additionally, U.S. firms are affected by various domestic policy issues which have brought unprecedented uncertainty and notable volatility of late (though many nations face significant challenges).

International markets are gaining significant ground due to more attractive valuations, favorable monetary policy, and a different mix of companies. The underlying driver of stock markets is expected firm profitability which is in turn dependent on economic conditions and innovation. While the U.S. equities markets will remain the gold standard, there are definitive signs that global dynamics are shifting. The coming months should be quite interesting to watch.

Most recently, Hollo served as the Chief Engineer at REFIRE, a leading fuel cell and electrolyzer manufacturer. ""Having spent over a decade commercializing sodium metal chloride batteries, I can say with confidence that what Inlyte has accomplished is a real leap forward,"" said Hollo. ""Inlyte's iron-sodium battery is technically mature, the supply chain is secure, and the company is ready to meet the needs of today's grid.""

Armstrong joins following a distinguished career in manufacturing across Ford Motor Company, Sun Microsystems, Oracle, Tesla, and Zero Motorcycles. At Tesla, Armstrong led a team of 1,800 employees manufacturing powertrain products for the Model X and Model S, and she brings her experience in scaling high-volume, cost-effective manufacturing in the United States to Inlyte. Armstrong also served as the VP of Manufacturing and Programs at Zero Motorcycles, where she doubled the company's manufacturing footprint in California to grow battery and motor production. ""In my experience, high-volume manufacturing is one of the hardest transitions for startups,"" said Armstrong. ""I'm excited to bring my experience scaling domestic manufacturing to deliver resilient, affordable energy storage to our customers.""

Goswami co-founded Molekule and led the company as the CEO, President, and CTO to $100M+ in revenue, $100M+ in successive fundraises and a public listing through a merger with AeroClean Technologies. Goswami's decision to join the leadership team follows his term as a Venture Partner at At One Ventures, where he led the firm's initial investment in Inlyte Energy. Goswami will lead Inlyte's finance and strategy to position the company for its next phase of growth. ""Inlyte has a unique position of innovative but proven technology, unbeatable cost, and surging customer interest,"" said Goswami. ""Now it's time to execute on our vision for large scale, safe, cost-effective energy storage.""

These hires come as Inlyte has announced its first utility-scale BESS project with Southern Company and a Department of Energy-backed commercial-scale project in a fire-risk zone in Northern California this year. The team will be attending the RE+ Conference in Las Vegas, NV next week to build commercial partnerships for Inlyte's first US factory.

(CNN) — The Environmental Protection Agency has moved to suspend more than 100 staffers who signed a letter of dissent against the Trump administration’s policies in July, a representative of the union covering the agency’s staff told CNN on Friday.

The EPA previously moved to fire a handful of employees late last week, but now it is taking disciplinary action against more than 130 employees also suspected of signing the letter, the representative said. These employees were sent letters indicating they would be suspended for 14 days without pay.

The reason cited in the letters is for “conduct unbecoming of a federal employee,” the representative said, noting that is highly unusual, if not unprecedented, under the circumstances.

An EPA spokesperson would not confirm the report or details, saying the agency “does not comment on individual personnel matters.”

“These workers bravely voiced concerns about harmful changes at the Agency that threaten the lives of every American. And we know the administration’s motives are not about government efficiency or advancing public safety. Placing these workers on leave and now firing or suspending them months later has wasted over 47,000 work hours and $2 million. This is simply about squashing dissent and preventing workers from protecting American lives,” said Justin Chen, president of the union group AFGE Council 238, in a statement Friday.

The EPA placed roughly 140 employees on administrative leave in July, days after they signed a public letter expressing concern about the treatment of federal employees and the Trump administration’s regulations on climate and public health. In the letter, employees criticized the EPA, saying it has strayed from its core mission to protect human health and the environment.

The EPA conducted an “administrative investigation” into the employees, who were placed on administrative leave until July 17, according to internal emails viewed by CNN at the time. Some employees were let go last week, but additional staff members were affected on Thursday.

On Friday, the agency’s spokesperson also repeated its previous statement on the matter, saying the EPA “has a zero-tolerance policy for career officials using their agency position and title to unlawfully undermine, sabotage, and undercut the will of the American public that was clearly expressed at the ballot box last November. Thankfully, this represents a small fraction of the thousands of hard-working, dedicated EPA employees who are not trying to mislead and scare the American public.”",https://kion546.b-cdn.net/2023/10/kionlogog-860x540.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 18:02:59.764527

That is why the Central Asian nation – already producing rare metals worth over $252.7 million annually – is investing in advanced mining technologies, infrastructure enhancements, and diverse international partnerships.","Amid the global hunt for natural resources, Kazakhstan aims to position itself as a reliable supplier of critical minerals. Although the energy-rich Central Asian nation is expected to soon become the third-largest holder of rare earth reserves in the world, Astana is signaling that it wants to be more than just a raw material supplier.

Kazakhstan’s decades-old cooperation with major international energy giants has shaped the country’s overall economic growth. The nation’s GDP per capita ($14,770, by far the highest in Central Asia) is expected to surpass Russia’s $14,260 and China’s $13,690. But from the Kazakh perspective, things could be even better. Astana now seeks to revise its contracts with Western oil corporations, particularly when it comes to oil exploitation.

According to reports, 98% of the revenue generated from Kashagan – a massive offshore oil field in the Caspian Sea and Kazakhstan’s most valuable find in the last five decades – is being funneled into the profits of Shell (UK), Eni (Italy) and Total Energies (France). It is, therefore, no surprise that the Central Asian nation aims to secure a more favorable stance in these arrangements.

Another challenge for Kazakhstan is the very structure of its export portfolio. Presently, Europe primarily imports oil from Kazakhstan, with 80% of it passing through Russia. Astana is actively working to diversify its exports and boost crude oil shipments via the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline.

Simultaneously, Astana is expected to continue working toward another ambitious goal: generating 15% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030 and 50 percent by 2050. It is part of the nation’s strategy to become a significant exporter of green electricity to Europe.

In parallel, Kazakhstan plans to attract new investors to its energy sector. It seeks to develop nuclear cooperation with Japan, while also eying to establish joint gas projects with Indonesia. Moreover, by the end of 2026 Kazakhstan and Jordan are expected to begin developing uranium deposits in the Middle Eastern country. If the results prove economically viable, a joint enterprise will be launched, and Kazakhstan’s Kazatomprom will hold a 70% stake, while the Jordanian National Uranium Company (Jumco) will retain 30%.

This move suggests that Astana is not only focused on tapping into its own natural resources, but is also looking to expand its energy interests beyond its borders. It is no secret that Kazakhstan – despite being the world’s largest producer of uranium – is interested in the extraction and processing of uranium and rare-earth metals in Tajikistan, a landlocked Central Asian nation that appears keen to strengthen its ties with its neighbor, the region’s largest economy.

Indeed, an increasing number of countries are eager to do business with Kazakhstan and establish closer economic and political ties with the energy-rich state. Fully aware of this, Kazakh policy makers decided to invite experts from various nations to discuss geopolitical, economic and strategic issues at upcoming the Astana Think Tank Forum. The event will take place on October 15-16, providing a platform for honest, constructive policy dialogue in a polarized world.

Over the years, Kazakhstan has been pursuing a balanced multilateral approach in the international arena, balancing relations with all major actors in Central Asia: Russia, China, the United States, and the European Union. The fact that Russia’s Rosatom and the China National Nuclear Corporation are set to build nuclear power plants in the largest regional nation, clearly indicates that Astana intends to extend its “multi-vector” approach to the energy sector as well.

In an attempt to diversify its export portfolio, Kazakhstan is actively cooperating with China in the development of its energy and mining sectors. At the same time, it seeks to strengthen ties with the U.S.-based investment firm Cove Capital, a company interested in conducting geological explorations in the former Soviet republic.

Reports suggest that in the first three months of the year, authorities in Kazakhstan identified 38 new mineral deposits, including gold, rare earth metals, copper, nickel, and brown coal. As Jozef Síkela, the European Commissioner for International Partnerships, stressed in March, the access to critical raw materials is essential for the EU to modernize its economy.

Kazakhstan, on the other hand, intends to modernize its existing production facilities and infrastructure, expand geological exploration, introduce modern processing technologies, and strengthen the research base. To achieve that goal, Astana plans to bring international partners into exploration and processing projects, aiming to gain access to advanced technology, state-of-the-art equipment, and lucrative markets.

The country holds significant reserves of critical minerals, including zinc, copper, lead, and nickel. However, despite the growing global demand for these resources, the ease and cost of mining will vary depending on factors such as depth, grade, water availability, and accessibility. Kazakhstan knows its mineral wealth has huge potential to help accelerate the world’s energy transition, and yield tangible benefits for its people. That is why the Central Asian nation – already producing rare metals worth over $252.7 million annually – is investing in advanced mining technologies, infrastructure enhancements, and diverse international partnerships.

Energy Equity: A Balancing Act For investors, the challenge lies in balancing the immediate risks of rising utility costs with the long-term potential of green energy.
Conclusion: Strategic Opportunities in a Shifting Energy Landscape Missouri's utility sector is a microcosm of the broader energy transition.","Missouri's energy landscape is undergoing a pivotal shift as Spire Missouri's recent gas rate hike—approved by the Missouri Public Service Commission (PSC)—takes effect on October 24, 2025. The 10% to 10.5% increase in natural gas rates will add approximately $8.21 to $8.93 per month to the average residential bill, depending on the region. While the hike is framed as necessary to fund infrastructure upgrades, it raises critical questions about affordability for households and the broader implications for energy equity. At the same time, the regulatory environment and infrastructure investments are creating fertile ground for energy infrastructure and green utility stocks to thrive.

The Financial Impact on Missouri Households

Spire's rate increase, though reduced from its original $289.5 million request to $210 million, still represents a significant burden for consumers. For eastern Missouri households, the $8.21 monthly increase may seem modest in isolation but compounds over time. For a family earning below the median income of $65,000 annually, this hike could consume 1.5% of their monthly budget—a non-trivial share when combined with inflationary pressures on other essentials. Western Missouri residents face a slightly higher 10.5% increase, reflecting regional infrastructure disparities.

However, the PSC's approval included safeguards. The rate hike is partially offset by a 40% drop in natural gas prices since 2024, ensuring that 2025 bills will still be lower than in the previous year. Additionally, Spire's low-income programs, such as the Limited Income Customer Charge Pilot Program—which waives a $22 monthly fee for qualifying households—provide critical relief. These measures highlight the tension between utility profitability and consumer affordability, a theme that will define energy policy debates in the coming years.

Regulatory Shifts and Infrastructure Investments: A Tailwind for Energy Stocks

The rate hike is part of a broader trend of regulatory alignment with infrastructure modernization. Missouri utilities are increasingly prioritizing grid resilience and renewable integration, driven by both necessity and policy incentives. Ameren Missouri (AEE), for instance, is capitalizing on this momentum with its $28 billion five-year plan. The company's Reform Renewable Energy Center—a 250-MW solar project adjacent to its nuclear-powered Callaway Energy Center—exemplifies the hybrid approach to energy generation. By pairing solar with battery storage and natural gas backup, Ameren is positioning itself to meet reliability demands while reducing carbon intensity.

Ameren's strategic alignment with regulatory goals—such as its net-zero-by-2045 target—has already translated into strong investor confidence. Its disciplined execution and regulatory approvals in Missouri and Illinois have enabled stable returns, making it a standout in the utility sector. Similarly, Evergy (EVE), another Missouri-based utility, is expanding its natural gas and solar capacity under a $2.75 billion infrastructure plan. While environmental groups have criticized its reliance on gas, the company's ability to secure federal tax credits for solar projects underscores the financial incentives driving this transition.

National Green Utility Stocks: Riding the Renewable Wave

Beyond Missouri, national green utility stocks are poised to benefit from the same forces. NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE), the world's largest wind and solar generator, is a prime example. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has supercharged its growth, with agreements to develop 10.5 gigawatts of renewables and storage by 2030. NextEra's transmission projects in AI-driven data center hubs like the PJM Interconnection further position it to capitalize on surging electricity demand.

Brookfield Renewable Partners LP (BEP) is another key player, leveraging its global hydroelectric and solar assets to meet corporate clean energy demands. Its recent partnership with Cameco to acquire Westinghouse—a nuclear services giant—signals a strategic pivot toward diversified energy solutions. Meanwhile, GE Vernova (GEV), spun off from General Electric, is gaining traction with its focus on offshore wind and grid modernization, supported by IRA tax credits.

Energy Equity: A Balancing Act

For investors, the challenge lies in balancing the immediate risks of rising utility costs with the long-term potential of green energy. Spire's rate hike and Missouri's regulatory environment highlight the need for utilities to invest in infrastructure while maintaining affordability. Companies that successfully navigate this balance—like Ameren and NextEra—offer a compelling mix of stable dividends and growth potential.

However, energy equity remains a critical concern. Low-income households, which already spend 3.5 times more of their income on energy than higher-income households, are disproportionately affected by rate hikes. Investors should consider utilities that integrate social responsibility into their strategies, such as Spire's pilot programs or Ameren's community-focused solar initiatives.

Conclusion: Strategic Opportunities in a Shifting Energy Landscape

Missouri's utility sector is a microcosm of the broader energy transition. While rising gas rates test consumer resilience, they also catalyze investments in infrastructure and renewables. For equity investors, the path forward lies in supporting companies that align with both regulatory trends and societal needs. Ameren, NextEra, and Brookfield represent not just financial opportunities but also models for sustainable energy equity in an era of rising costs and climate urgency.

As the October 24 rate hike looms, the interplay between affordability, infrastructure, and innovation will define Missouri's energy future—and the stocks that lead the charge.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-06 18:03:13.591064

By Rystad Energy More Top Reads From Oilprice.com Canada Rethinks EV Targets to Aid Carmakers Oil Slips 2% as Saudi Arabia Presses OPEC+ to Fast-Track Output Hike SCO Unity Crumbles Amidst Internal Conflicts","US President Donald Trump significantly pivoted US energy policy with the signing of The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), transforming supply chains, redirecting investment flows and solidifying the US government’s support of traditional fuels. The act, which underscored the administration’s domestic energy dominance ambitions, was packed with various cost-cutting measures that directly reversed key provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Rystad Energy estimates that the OBBBA’s aggressive foreign content tests, and restrictions on Specified Foreign Entities (SPEs), may force companies to build more resilient, but potentially more expensive, supply chains, independent of target nations. Specific provisions, like the North American feedstock requirement for biofuels, will likely directly reshape global trade flows, creating clear-cut winners and losers in international commodity markets.

Compared to the IRA’s original timeline, the OBBBA shortens the runway for projects in several key sectors, accelerating the termination of tax credits for wind, solar and clean hydrogen. In a clear policy choice, biofuels received a favorable multi-year extension of credits, while consumer-facing credits for electric vehicles (EVs) and residential solar are eliminated.

One of the law’s most significant revisions is the shortened timeline for Clean Electricity Production and Investment Tax Credits, known as the 45Y and 48E credits. Now, solar and wind projects must begin construction within the next 12 months and be placed in service by end of 2027, rather than after 2032. Rystad Energy expects developers to rush orders for project materials to comply with the new one-year period set by the OBBBA to safe-harbor incentives for projects to be placed in service by 2029-2030.

The OBBBA also?introduces stringent changes for clean energy manufacturing and supply chains, with the most critical changes in the introduction of new restrictions on foreign content. To qualify for the remaining tax credits, project components must meet domestic or ‘friend-shored’ sourcing thresholds that escalate over time, topping out as high as 90% for some equipment. From a solar developer’s perspective, meeting the Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) requirements will be a costly and arduous process.

US shale companies with the most exposure to federal land with mineral rights stand to benefit from the royalty rate cut and tax incentives ushered in through the OBBBA. Although the legislation may not spur a new era of high growth from US shale oil plays, marginal benefits can be realized through continued near-term investments and improved economics that will favor companies with the most exposure to federal lands. In the long term, reduced federal royalty rates could help lower the marginal supply cost needed for new incremental sources of gas. Additionally, Rystad Energy finds that the reinstatement of the 100% bonus depreciation for tangible capital expenditure could lower breakeven prices by one to two dollars per barrel for short-term development in most core unconventional US oil plays, assuming consistent recurring investment. This benefit will apply to all companies, regardless of federal lands exposure.

The impact of the OBBBA, much like the IRA, will resonate globally, calibrating the competitive landscape for clean tech investment. Ultimately, the US has shifted its policy away from green technology acceleration to a more guarded strategy focused on domestic energy security, creating a more complex and uncertain environment for the future of the energy transition.

In addition to writing 21 significant books on climate and justice, “he is a founder of 350.org, the first planet-wide, grassroots climate change movement, which has organized twenty thousand rallies around the world in every country save North Korea, spearheaded the resistance to the Keystone Pipeline, and launched the fast-growing fossil fuel divestment movement.”

Turning point with climate

He also is a co-founder of Third Act, which mobilizes people over age 60 for action on climate and justice, including Third Act Florida in our state: thirdact.org.

On Aug. 19, 2025, Bill McKibben launched his most recent book, “Here Comes the Sun: A Last Chance for the Climate and a Fresh Chance for Civilization.” What is most remarkable to many, including Bill McKibben himself, is that just when it seems the news could not be worse about the condition of the planet, renewable energy has crossed a crucial threshold of being both affordable and accessible.

“Sometime in the course of this decade, we passed some invisible line where it became cheaper to produce energy from the sun and the wind than from burning coal and gas and oil,” McKibben writes. He believes that if we act now, we will be able to put the brakes on climate devastation and solve problems related to our earth and our humanity that desperately need addressing.

As someone who has for most of his career been the bearer of bad news regarding climate, the “doomsday prophet” as he has been called and calls himself, what a delight to him and to us to realize that there is legitimate hope for our planet if we act now.

Another 'Sun Day' on Sept. 21

On the first “Sun Day,” on May 3, 1978, President Jimmy Carter visited the Solar Energy Research Institute that his administration had founded in 1977, three years after Congress and the Nixon White House had taken steps to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil.

Carter said, “We must begin the long, slow job of winning back our economic independence. Nobody can embargo sunlight. No cartel controls the sun. Its energy will not run out. It will not pollute the air; it will not poison our waters. It's free from stench and smog. The sun's power needs only to be collected, stored, and used.”

McKibben laments that we did not find the will to move on this opportunity 48 years ago, but is so thrilled that we have another chance today if we only take it.

This year’s Sun Day is scheduled for Sept. 21, and the hope is to organize a powerful climate movement to take advantage of this remarkable opportunity affordable solar power is presenting to us. The Sun Day website found at sunday.earth is easy to use and offers helpful ideas about how to plan and register an event, whether large or small, to take action, how to find an event to join, and how to celebrate the power of clean energy.

Harnessing solar

There is a playlist on Spotify of sun songs, a sun drawing collection from people around the world who have drawn the Sun Day logo, to which you can add your own drawing, and suggested postcards you create to send to lawmakers. And above all, we can read and share McKibben’s remarkable book, with astonishing information about the ways in which we are on the road to restoring some of what we have lost.

Solar is no longer alternative energy, as it is growing faster than any energy source in history. And the key now, he says, is to propel the rising solar power movement forward despite massive resistance from the fossil-fuel industry and its political enablers.

A theologian I admire, Diana Butler Bass, praises his book not only for the remarkable information contained within it, but “the sheer beauty of its prose.” It has important dimensions of scientific information and moral imperative that invite the reader to hope and to action.

McKibben is not a preacher, though he has taught Sunday School and led worship at his small Vermont Methodist Church.

He does say in gratitude, “The good Lord was kind enough to hang this big ball of burning gas 93 million miles up in the sky. And he's given us the wit to learn how to make full use of it. It's a shame that we let it go to waste day after day after day after day. The sun already gives us light; it already gives us warmth. It already allows us to have photosynthesis, and now it's willing to give us all the power we could ever want. I think we should thank God for that.”

It is my prayer that we will thank God and find the will to take advantage of this remarkable gift that is ours if we act now. Would you join thousands of others across the globe who see this as a decisive moment?

Sept. 7 is Grandparents Day. Perhaps those of us who are grandparents will get involved for the sake of those children we adore. Or the one death in five globally that could be saved annually without breathing combustion byproducts of fossil fuel. Or to seize the single greatest possibility for rapid development and poverty alleviation that we've ever seen in renewable energy. Together we can do this. How exciting!

Why are electric bills in Indiana higher this summer?

Electric bills in Indiana, including Monroe County, are higher this summer than a year ago because of higher electricity rates and above-normal temperatures.

State regulators early this year approved a request by Duke Energy to be allowed to raise its electric rates.

A spokeswoman for the utility said the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission allowed Duke Energy to raise its rates by about 9% in February, which is contributing to rates this summer being higher than a year ago. Rates will increase another roughly 4% early next year.

However, Duke’s Lead Communications Manager McKenzie Barbknecht said higher temperatures this summer also have contributed.

Average temperatures in Bloomington this summer:

June: 75.6 degrees, or 3.6 degrees above normal, Barbknecht said via email.

July: 79.3 degrees, or 4.6 degrees above normal.

August, as of the middle of the month: 76.4 degrees, or 2.4 degrees above normal.

What does Duke Energy plan to do with the additional revenue?

The utility said in a news release early this year that it asked state regulators to be allowed to hike rakes “to continue making investments in a modernized electric grid that is more resistant to power outages, increasing reliability at our power plants, constructing hundreds of miles of new power lines, complying with evolving environmental responsibilities and improving electric grid security.”

The utility said that among other things, it has been installing:

Sensors on power lines that can detect problems automatically and would reroute power, much like a GPS system in a car reroutes a driver.

Underground power lines and steel poles to replace wood poles to harden its system against severe weather.

How can you lower your electric bill?

Duke and the U.S. Department of Energy said you can reduce your electricity usage by:

Raising your thermostat.

Using cool water to wash clothes.

Running heat-producing appliances in the morning when it’s cooler.

Closing curtains on the sunny side of your home.

Operating ceiling fans (counterclockwise).

Buying energy-efficient appliances, electronics and lights.

Reducing “always-on” appliances. Look for electronics that you don’t use or can switch off — or perhaps get rid of that extra refrigerator.

Are we done for the year with high temps? What's the forecast?

While many Hoosiers have gotten a nice break from summer heat in the past few days, with highs in the low- to mid-70s, the mercury is expected to rise again in Bloomington, with highs in the mid-80s in mid-September, according to The Weather Channel — though lows will remain in the mid- to high 50s.

Source: DOT, IRS EV STATS IN HAWAII >> Hawaii has 38,086 registered passengers EVs.","For electric vehicle drivers in Hawaii, there will soon be few, if any, perks left — as some of the most popular ones are set to expire this month.

Solo drivers with EV license plates have since 2012 been permitted to use the high-occupancy vehicle lane on Oahu highways, which are usually reserved for cars with at least two occupants during rush hour to encourage carpooling.

On Sept. 30, a federal code allowing states to set their own HOV lane requirements expires, and federal tax credits of up to $7,500 for the purchase or lease of EV vehicles also end.

These changes come at a time when Hawaii is being held accountable for its ambitious, state-mandated goals of achieving 100% clean energy and net-zero emissions by 2045, and are expected to hamper efforts to get more residents to drive electric in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

“It definitely doesn’t help,” said state Rep. Nicole Lowen, chair of the House Energy and Environmental Protection Committee. “Taking incentives away isn’t pushing things in the right direction.”

Still, she thinks most of the impetus behind EV adoption has been market­ driven.

The HOV lane perk may have been an incentive for some drivers commuting on the H-1 freeway to go electric, but even without it, EVs remain a competitive choice for consumers, she said, because they cost less to own and operate in the long run.

There are fewer maintenance costs, such as a regular oil changes, and no more waiting in line at the gas station.

“From a consumer point of view, there’s still a really strong case for it,” she said. “I think we’ll continue to see people buying EVs.”

History of perks

In an effort to boost the adoption of EVs, Hawaii passed a law in 2012 that offered a smorgasbord of perks.

EVs were not only allowed to use the HOV lane with only one occupant, but granted free parking at street parking meters, in state and county parking lots, and at airport parking lots.

Those privileges sunsetted on July 1, 2020, but the state Department of Transportation extended the HOV perk for EV drivers.

DOT says it is complying with federal law come Sept. 30, but will retain language written into Hawaii’s administration rules should states be able to make their own rules once again.

Additionally, car consumers will no longer be eligible for a $7,500 in federal tax credits for the purchase of new EVs as a result of President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” adopted in July. Hawaii does not offer tax credits or rebates for the purchase of EVs.

The Electric Vehicle Association called the rollback of incentives a step in the wrong direction and “a lane change we can’t afford to make.”

EVA board member Elaine Borseth called the HOV lane perk “one of the simplest, most effective ways to encourage clean transportation,” and said it’s still necessary, given that EV adoption is still in a critical growth phase.

“We’re on our way, but we’re not there yet,” she said in a recent blog post. “Removing low-cost, high-impact incentives like HOV access risks slowing the momentum just when we need it most.”

EVs on the rise

Noel Morin, president of the Hawaii EV Association, said it is unfortunate to see these barriers to adoption, especially as sales are gaining momentum in the state.

The perks and tax incentives appear to have spurred the growth of EVs in Hawaii, with year-over-year increases over the past five years.

In July 2021 there were 15,551 registered EVs in Hawaii, which more than doubled to nearly 33,000 by July 2024. As of July this year, the state counted 38,086 registered EVs in Hawaii, a 16% increase from 2024.

EVs now represent 3.5% of the more than 1 million registered passenger vehicles in the state.

“If you look at the trajectory, more people are adopting EVs,” Morin said. “As people upgrade, and rental car companies dispense of EVs, it also means you have a pre-owned market.”

The range of EV batteries has improved, and there are an expanding number of EV options to choose from in the U.S., including ones that start at lower price points from brands such as Nissan, Chevrolet and Hyundai.

Locally, the expanding pre-owned EV market also offers consumers more affordable EV choices.

The addition of tariffs and Matson’s recent announcement that it will no longer ship EVs to Hawaii complicate the market outlook, but the days in which EVs were considered a rarity in Hawaii are over.

The Tesla Model Y, despite a drop in sales, is the third-most-popular vehicle in the state, according to Hawaii Auto Outlook, two notches below the Toyota Tacoma, which has long taken the top spot.

Hawaii also has been recognized as a top state in the U.S. for EV adoption.

J.D. Power last year ranked Hawaii third, behind California and Washington, in EV adoption based on an index weighing consumer preferences and availability. Hawaii was also among the top five EV markets, with EVs making up nearly 12% of new vehicle sales in the state.

Achieving EV equity

“We see an increase in EV registrations, so it’s steadily heading in the right direction, but obviously, not fast enough,” said Jeff Mikulina of Climate Hawaii. “The timing is very unfortunate for these new changes.”

While perks help get people in the door, he said, Hawaii needs a clean transportation program that works for everyone.

“So I think it’s on the state, now, particularly with this Navahine settlement, to really focus on equity and infrastructure, and making those take center stage,” he said.

That means making EVs more accessible for families, renters, and rural communities, he said, and investing in more charging stations, particularly for multifamily units — and doing everything possible to make clean transportation “the default as opposed to a luxury.”

DOT released a 205-page draft of its plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as part of a settlement of a lawsuit – Navahine vs. DOT — filed by a group of young climate activists.

Public comments on the draft were due by the end of Sunday.

As a legislator, Lowen has introduced bills seeking to expand EV charging infrastructure, including one offering rebates for EV-ready parking stalls in new affordable housing developments.

Morin agreed much more needs to be done to accelerate the adoption of EVs in the state if Hawaii is to reach its clean-energy goals.

Hawaii consumes nearly 40 million gallons of gasoline and diesel each month, and gas and diesel vehicles still make up 93% of all registered passenger vehicles in the state.

“It’s not just about EVs,” Morin said. “It’s about sustainable transportation. It’s about efficient transportation.”

That includes expanding other options like public transit, biking, walking, and rideshares.

“We want to be independent of fossil fuel imports,” Morin said. “We don’t want to be dependent on ships coming in to turn on our lights, transport our kids, or do our jobs. One way to do that is to achieve these goals.”

While it’s going to “take a little longer to make it happen,” he said, it doesn’t change the urgency of those aspirations.

Education is still a part of it, and Hawaii EV is hosting events locally from Sept. 12 to Oct. 12 to raise awareness on the numerous benefits of electric cars, trucks, and motorcycles as part of National Drive Electric Month.

Mikulina said the timing of the federal cutbacks is unfortunate, but is nevertheless confident that market demand for EVs will not go away, as global trends show the future is electric.

“Really, I think the momentum is so strong to electrify transportation and for clean energy,” said Mikulina, “that this is this is just a speed hump.”

CHANGES AFOOT FOR EV DRIVERS

>> On Sept. 30, the right to use the HOV lane during rush hour by solo EV drivers ends.

>> Where are HOV lanes? Oahu, the most populated isle in Hawaii, is home to most HOV lanes, which are available on the H-1 highway weekday mornings, as well as on H-2, Nimitz, Moanalua, and Kalanianaole highways.

>> On Sept. 30, federal tax credits of up to $7,500 for the purchase of eligible new EVs, and up to $4,000 for used EVs expires. These tax credits were originally set to last through Dec. 31, 2032, under the Inflation Reduction Act.

>> What to know: The IRS says a contract signed or down payment made for an EV before Sept. 30 is still eligible, even if the car is delivered at a later time. The vehicle must be acquired with a written binding contract before Sept. 30.

>> Starting in July, Hawaii EV owners could choose between paying a per-mile road usage charge of $8 per 1,000 miles, capped at $50, or annual fee of $50 (replacing the $50 EV surcharge). In 2028, all EV owners must pay the per-mile usage charge.

MEDIA RELEASE

Port Kembla Transformation a Generational Opportunity for Illawarra

The Property Council of Australia today welcomed the NSW Government’s announcement of plans to transform 200 hectares of underutilised land at BlueScope’s Port Kembla site into a hub for advanced manufacturing, clean energy, logistics, and education – creating up to 30,000 new jobs.

Property Council Illawarra Shoalhaven Regional Director Matthew Wales said the announcement was a major win for the region, reflecting years of advocacy for investment in Port Kembla’s future.

“Port Kembla has always been the industrial heartbeat of the Illawarra, and today’s announcement sets the stage for it to become the region’s growth engine for the next generation,” Mr Wales said.

“Our members have consistently called for government and industry to work together on a long-term plan for Port Kembla. We are proud to see this vision taking shape with a rezoning proposal that unlocks new industries while preserving the site’s proud industrial history.”

Mr Wales said the Property Council has long championed the need for a diversified Illawarra economy, with the Port Kembla Master Plan at the centre of that ambition.

“BlueScope’s master plan shows what’s possible when we plan big – thousands of jobs in emerging industries, billions in new investment, and a secure future for local workers,” Mr Wales said.

“With this rezoning now on exhibition, we look forward to working with government, BlueScope and the community to ensure the delivery of this transformational project.”

The Property Council has previously called for state investment to support Port Kembla’s expansion, recognising the precinct’s potential to underpin economic growth and create a multi-faceted industrial hub for the future.

“We’ve consistently highlighted the opportunity to unlock underutilised land around the steelworks to attract new industries and create a stronger future for the Illawarra,” Mr Wales said.

“This project is about giving local workers and businesses the confidence that Port Kembla will remain the region’s industrial engine while opening the door to new careers in advanced manufacturing, clean energy and technology. That certainty is exactly what investors, educators and contractors have been waiting for.

“This site might be the same size as Monaco, but it won’t be luxury yachts, casinos and Formula One, it will be proudly Illawarra – practical, hardworking and focused on building the industries of tomorrow.”

“The Property Council will continue to work with all partners to make sure this momentum translates into lasting jobs and opportunities for the community,” Mr Wales said.

Spiro and Catholic Church Partner to Roll Out Solar-Powered Swap Stations Across Kenya

Spiro, one of the leading electric mobility companies in Africa, has just signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Catholic Church in Kenya to establish solar-powered battery swap stations nationwide, advancing the country’s transition to clean and affordable mobility.

Spiro says this initiative is the first of its kind at this scale, combining Spiro’s e-mobility technology with the Catholic Church’s trusted grassroots presence to expand access to affordable, renewable energy solutions across urban and rural Kenya. The Catholic Church has a big presence in Kenya. For example, the Archdiocese of Nairobi, which covers two counties (Nairobi and Kiambu Counties), has 16 deaneries, 127 parishes, and over 4,000 small Christian communities. Across the whole country, the Catholic Church has over 1,000 parishes and over 5,000 mission stations. Facilities ranging from schools to healthcare centres, as well as other real estate, form quite a large portfolio.

“Rolling out solar-powered swap stations marks a new chapter in Kenya’s clean mobility journey. By combining renewable energy with our battery swapping technology and working hand in hand with the Catholic Church, we are ensuring riders can power their journeys affordably, sustainably, and closer to where they live and work,” said Kshitij Sharma, Spiro Kenya country head.

“The Catholic Church is committed to initiatives that safeguard creation and promote the wellbeing of our communities. Partnering with Spiro to establish solar-powered battery swap stations aligns with our mission of stewardship and service, bringing affordable and clean mobility solutions closer to the people we serve,” said Fr. John.

Spiro says the rollout will be phased across the country, helping Kenya cut emissions, lower transport costs, and advance its climate action goals. By embedding clean energy infrastructure within communities, the partnership is set to unlock new green jobs, reduce reliance on fossil fuels, and make sustainable transport accessible to millions.

Spiro adds that this MoU reflects Spiro’s wider mission to transform Africa’s transport ecosystem through locally manufactured, green mobility solutions while collaborating with institutions that hold deep trust and reach at the community level. This collaboration came out of the blue. It’s one that you wouldn’t normally expect. But it’s an interesting one that makes a lot of sense. The motorcycle industry is a vital pillar of Kenya’s transport system. There are about 4 million vehicles registered in Kenya. Motorcycles make up over 50% of the country’s fleet. It’s no surprise then that motorcycles are seeing most of the action in Kenya, and at the moment, the motorcycle sector is the main driver of electric vehicle adoption. In 2024, just over 7% of new motorcycle registrations were electric, followed by 4% for electric tuk tuks, 1.1% for electric buses and minibuses, and then 0.18% for electric cars.

As the Catholic Church is embedded in the community with a wide presence, people going to church or other business at Catholic Church facilities will no doubt include a large portion getting there via motorcycle taxi. Leveraging this large network and real estate to facilitate adoption of electric mobility supported by solar-powered swap stations at these Catholic facilities looks like a great initiative. A good number of these facilities would naturally be in rural areas as well. Therefore, implementing this solar-powered swap station there would help improve connectivity in these areas as well.

This collaboration got me thinking. Smart partnerships between the new electric mobility companies and existing local organisations can help propel the electric mobility industry to new heights at a much faster pace. In general, the electric mobility sector in most African countries has been driven by startups without much government support. We haven’t seen the kind of financial incentives that helped propel the EV sector in Europe, North America, and China. In a lot of African countries, the transition has been led by locally developed solutions solving real-world everyday problems, resonating with the target market and driving initial uptake. In sectors such as the motorcycle industry, the unit economics just made sense, and customers in the target segments clearly saw the potential savings on fuel and general operational costs, enticing them to switch to electric motorcycles.

Armed with results from real-world pilots, several firms have managed to raise significant funds from investors, helping them grow from early pilot phase to early commercialisation, and some have even grown to full commercial operations. Besides traditional equity and debt contributions, which can be quite hard to close for startups on the African continent, especially in a new sector such as electric mobility, innovative partnerships could provide a pathway to sustaining these businesses. In all of these markets, there are family owned or even larger businesses that have been operating in those markets for decades, accumulating decades of local market expertise, including how to navigate the local business environment. These businesses would have accumulated loads of cash over the years and would be looking to diversify and put some of that money to use in a forward-looking industry.

Another area to leverage is these organizations would have built a very large client base and network that these electric mobility startups could plug into, providing a good base to start with and scale. Just like in the case of the Catholic Church, some of these organisations could have large real estate portfolios, which in some cases are underutilised, and partnerships with electric mobility startups could open up win-win scenarios where the mobility startup gets access to prime sites for infrastructure such as EV charging and battery swap stations and the owners of the properties get to earn some additional revenues and unlock efficiencies. I think the industry will grow more via leveraging these local partnerships. This will help get it to a level where large institutional investors will start to notice and get the confidence to invest in mobility companies as they usually do in other areas. This will also give confidence to larger traditional investors such as the large pension funds that want to invest in less risky portfolios. I hope we start to see more collaborations like this.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Kenya-Spiro-elecric-motorcycles-Catholic-Church.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 18:02:48.091205

Here in Connecticut, we’re not backing down. This fall, we have important opportunities to defend clean energy, and make sure people know the facts about what’s at stake and how we can take action together.

Although this bill passed, federal clean energy tax credits are still available, but only for a limited time.

Families can save thousands of dollars while reducing pollution:

$4,000 back on a used EV, or instant savings when you lease one before September 30th 2025.

Households can also receive up to $1,000 for installing a home charger. For home energy upgrades by June 30, 2026.

Families can claim up to $3,200 in tax credits for audits, heat pumps, and insulation through December 31, 2025.

For solar panels, home batteries, and other clean energy projects, the credit covers up to 30% back on multiple projects through 2025.

These programs were designed to save money and accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels. Trump’s cuts will take that away, which makes it more important than ever to claim these benefits now and speak out.

In the weeks ahead, we’re coming together to show the strength of the clean energy movement.

OFFSHORE WIND

On Friday, August 22 the Trump Administration ordered an immediate halt to work on Revolution Wind, a wind project that was 80% complete. The wind farm was being built at the State Pier in New London, and part of its electricity is coming to Connecticut bringing affordable, renewable offshore wind to our state. In all, this wind project supports more than 2,500 U.S. jobs across construction, operations, shipbuilding, and manufacturing.

You can see the Sierra Club Connecticut statement on this order.

Connecticut has committed to two gigawatts of offshore wind energy, and support is growing across the state and along the East Coast. Offshore wind is one of the most powerful tools we have to tackle the climate crisis while creating healthier communities and stronger local economies.

Offshore wind means good jobs for local workers, from shipyards and ports to electricians and clean energy technicians. It means healthier air by cutting pollution from fossil fuels so families can breathe easier. It means homegrown, reliable power that stabilizes electricity costs and reduces our dependence on imported fuels. And it means thriving coastal economies, with revitalized infrastructure and new opportunities for small businesses.

We stand with communities, laborers, and local leaders who are saying YES to Offshore Wind. Together, we can power our future with clean, affordable, and reliable energy while creating resilient places to live and work.

Add Your Name: Say YES to Offshore Wind

Yet it is increasingly clear that reducing fossil fuel combustion will bring immediate benefits for the issue of air pollution.
Racial-ethnic minorities were found to experience the greatest differences in air pollution exposure and health burdens.
An earlier economic analysis estimated that improvements in air pollution from net zero policies in the US could reduce early deaths from air pollution by between 4,000 and 15,000 a year in 2035, a health gain of $65bn-$128bn.","Efforts to improve the climate could reduce the number of deaths caused by air pollution in the US by about 6,000 people a year by 2030, according to a study. If action is not taken, the situation is predicted to worsen. This is because of a growing and ageing population who are more vulnerable to the impacts of air pollution, resulting in nearly 13,000 increased air pollution deaths in 2030 compared with 2015.

The research, led by Princeton University, looked at pollution sources and population. These revealed health gains from climate actions across every US state and, more locally, in nearly every US county.

Climate actions are often framed around targets that are several decades away. Yet it is increasingly clear that reducing fossil fuel combustion will bring immediate benefits for the issue of air pollution.

Xinyuan Huang, the lead author of the US-wide research, said: “Climate actions not only reduce carbon emissions but also bring significant air-quality improvements to regions with historically high pollution levels.

“Under ambitious climate policies, states like West Virginia and Kentucky could see deaths from particle pollution decrease by over 19% in 2030, demonstrating the substantial health benefits of shifting away from fossil fuels.”

Policies and actions included more renewable energy, such as wind and solar power; increased uptake of electric cars; and the electrification of freight trucks.

They also included reductions in vehicle miles travelled as well as gains from low- and zero-emission zones and decongestion charging, such as the successful scheme in New York. As in many parts of the world, decarbonising US buildings is challenging, although heat pumps outsold fossil gas boilers in the country in 2023.

Dr Wei Peng said: “Figuring out how to leverage and combine actions to maximise local benefits will be important to promote widespread public support for this transition. With a focus on the health benefits, our study aims to offer insights into this critical policy challenge.”

Separate research, published last month, found large inequalities in the health burden from fossil fuel and production and use in the US. Racial-ethnic minorities were found to experience the greatest differences in air pollution exposure and health burdens. Louisiana and Texas had the most extreme inequalities in exposure, mainly from fossil fuel production and processing.

An earlier economic analysis estimated that improvements in air pollution from net zero policies in the US could reduce early deaths from air pollution by between 4,000 and 15,000 a year in 2035, a health gain of $65bn-$128bn.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ba11d7b78f296b602da23f474b235c78f8d4c73/0_0_4259_3409/master/4259.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=175e794f619789f17b9e923454be2c83",N,,2025-09-06 18:03:29.425522

While federal deregulation and a focus on fossil fuels introduced significant strategic risks, market forces and state-level initiatives revealed enduring opportunities. This analysis examines how these dynamics shaped investor sentiment, corporate strategies, and stock performance in the renewable energy space.

Regulatory Rollbacks and Market Dynamics

The Trump administration’s energy agenda prioritized deregulation and fossil fuel expansion, epitomized by the withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement in 2017 and the replacement of the Obama-era Clean Power Plan with the weaker Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule in 2019 [1]. These moves accelerated permitting for oil, gas, and coal projects while slowing the deployment of renewables [2]. According to a report by Renewable Energy Vulnerabilities and Fossil Fuel Revival, the administration’s policies created a “headwind” for solar and wind technologies reliant on federal subsidies, such as the 30% tax credit for solar installations [3].

However, the sector’s resilience emerged from declining technology costs and state-level commitments. Despite federal rollbacks, solar installations grew by 50% during Trump’s first term, driven by state incentives and corporate demand [4]. This duality—federal policy headwinds and market-driven tailwinds—underscored the sector’s adaptability but also highlighted its vulnerability to regulatory shifts.

Investor Sentiment and Stock Volatility

Clean energy stocks faced heightened volatility during Trump’s tenure, particularly in response to policy announcements. A 2024 Reuters analysis noted a sharp drop in the MAC Global Solar Energy Index following Trump’s re-election, as investors feared further rollbacks of tax credits and subsidies [5]. The administration’s emphasis on deregulation and fossil fuels also led to a “divergence in market performance,” with the S&P 500 rising 63.0% from 2017 to 2021, while clean energy indices lagged [6].

Academic studies further contextualize this volatility. Research published in Energy Economics found that Trump’s tweets on energy topics amplified speculative behavior in oil markets, indirectly affecting renewable energy sectors through investor uncertainty [7]. Additionally, the phaseout of federal tax credits under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act by 2025 introduced a “race against time” for companies like Xcel Energy to secure incentives, creating short-term price swings [8].

Corporate Adaptation Strategies

Faced with federal inaction, corporations and states became pivotal in sustaining clean energy growth. For example, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), enacted under Biden, demonstrated how state-level and private-sector initiatives could fill federal gaps. Even during Trump’s term, companies leveraged state incentives and international markets to advance projects [9]. This adaptability, however, came at a cost: firms had to navigate fragmented regulatory landscapes and accelerate timelines to meet expiring tax credit deadlines [10].

ESG Fund Flows and Long-Term Resilience

The ESG investment landscape reflected a similar tension. While $50 billion flowed into ESG funds in 2020 and $70 billion in 2021, reflecting strong demand for sustainable investing, outflows began in 2023 and 2024 as Trump’s anti-ESG rhetoric gained traction [11]. A CNBC analysis noted that despite these outflows, ESG assets still grew in 2024 due to market appreciation, suggesting long-term resilience [12].

Strategic Risks and Opportunities

For investors, the Trump-era experience highlights two key lessons:

1. Policy Risk: Clean energy stocks remain sensitive to regulatory shifts, as seen in the MAC index’s post-2024 drop. Companies reliant on federal subsidies face heightened exposure to policy reversals.

2. Opportunistic Resilience: Declining technology costs and state-level momentum create a floor for growth. Firms that diversify funding sources (e.g., state incentives, private equity) and prioritize international markets may mitigate federal policy risks.

Conclusion

Trump’s renewable energy rollbacks exposed the sector to strategic risks but also revealed its capacity to adapt through market innovation and subnational action. While federal policy uncertainty remains a headwind, the interplay of falling costs, corporate agility, and ESG demand suggests that the clean energy transition is far from derailed. Investors must balance short-term volatility with long-term structural trends, recognizing that the sector’s future will be shaped as much by state and corporate action as by federal policy.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-06 18:03:21.125881

Experts predict EV sales gains through the end of the month.

Car buyers may get some good deals on EVs, analysts said.

August was Ford Motor Co.'s sixth consecutive month of sales gains, driven by SUVs and big gains in sales of electric vehicles as the nation's car buyers hurried to get ahead of the expiration of the federal EV tax credit.

On Sept. 3, Ford reported August U.S. sales increased by 3.9% to 190,206 vehicles sold in the month compared with the year-ago August. For the first eight months of the year, Ford has sold a total of 1.5 million vehicles in the United States, a 6.6% gain compared with the same period a year ago.

Sales for Ford's luxury brand, Lincoln, declined 14.9% to 8,379 vehicles sold in August and sales at the Ford brand came in at 181,827 vehicles, a 5% gain compared with August 2024.

But the big winner for Ford was its retail EV sales. Sales of EVs skyrocketed by 19% to a total of 10,671 sold in August. Year to date, however, Ford's EV sales are down 5.7% at 57,888 sold.

""The ‘pull forward’ effect of vanishing EV incentives is reflected in Ford’s electric vehicle sales last month,"" Karl Brauer, executive analyst with iSeeCars.com, told the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network, on Sept. 3. ""Consumers planning an EV purchase in the next three to six months are now rushing to buy one before the federal tax break goes away on Sept. 30.""

What's driving EV sales

In August, Ford sold 18,773 hybrid vehicles, a gain of 14.5% compared with August 2024. Hybrid vehicles run on an electric motor before switching to a gasoline engine when the electric motor charge runs out.

Ford's sales of internal combustion vehicles, those that run on gasoline, inched up 2% in August to 160,762 gasoline cars sold.

Year to date, Ford's sales of hybrid vehicles are up 24% to 155,107 sold. January through August, Ford has sold 1.3 million gasoline-powered vehicles, a gain of 5.5% compared with the same period in 2024.

Sales of the all-electric Mustang Mach-E rose 35.3% to 7,226 in the month; sales of the Lightning F-150 rose 21.2% to 3,217 in the month; but sales of the limited commercial vehicle E-Transit plummeted 76% to 228 sold.

The driver behind these gains in retail EV sales is the mega-tax bill signed into law in July. That legislation pushed up the expiration date of the federal clean vehicle tax credit to Sept. 30 from its original date of 2032. That means the deadline for snagging a tax credit of up to $7,500 on a qualifying, new electric vehicle is closing in.

Edmunds.com's Ivan Drury said Ford’s straightforward marketing messages coupled with incentives that resonate with consumers has resulted in positive sales, especially in EVs.

""This is a night and day difference between last year when Ford’s EVs were sitting on the lot for 99 days on average back in August of 2024 versus this August at nearly half that with 51 day lot times,"" Drury, Edmunds' director of Insights, said. ""The EV turnaround stems from both the right mix of incentives catering towards leasing with 64% of Ford EV’s being leased versus 48% last August as well as the clock ticking on the EV tax credit expiring, putting a sense of urgency behind any potential EV consumers.""

The problem is sustainability, Drury said. He said with the tax credit set to expire, the industry will see the binge on EVs result in a hangover during fourth quarter.

Car buyers can expect EV deals

Savvy consumers can't help but be aware of the EV tax credit's impending death. For those who aren't, all they have to do is look at auto websites and ads. Some dealers are running headlines on their sites that read: ""Plug in before it powers down.""

As the Detroit Free Press reported in early August, analysts predict EV sales to be the strongest ever during the third quarter as consumers scramble to take advantage of the tax credit.

“The urgency created by the administration’s decision to sunset government-backed, IRA-era EV incentives was expected to create serious demand for EVs in the short term. If last month is any measure: Mission Accomplished,"" wrote Stephanie Valdez Streaty, Cox senior analyst, in a report released Aug. 13. ""July sales were near an all-time monthly record. At this pace, Q3 will be the best ever and then some, as buyers jump in before the big incentives dry up.”

Brauer told the Free Press that the EV sales spike will continue through the end of September across all EV models, ""followed by a whipsaw"" in the other direction as EV sales evaporate in the fourth quarter, similar to Drury's prediction.

""It’s a predictable pattern, one we see whenever large purchase incentives are removed from the marketplace,"" Brauer said.

In the meantime, consumers can expect to find deals as EV inventory evaporates.

""Dealers are very aware of this pattern, and those with EV stock will offer increasingly desirable pricing and financing as the end of September draws near,"" Brauer said. ""Having a large supply of unsold EVs on their lot on Oct. 1 is a position dealerships will actively avoid.""

Ford's other results

For the month, Ford sold 81,539 SUVs, a 6.2% gain compared with August 2024. Sales of pickups rose 2.4% to 105,432 sold. Sales of traditional passenger cars inched up 2.2% to 3,235 sold.

Some winners: Bronco sales rose 32% to 13,378 vehicles sold in August compared with the year-ago period. August Explorer sales soared 22% to 20,617 vehicles sold. Sales of the Maverick pickup rose 16.4% to 11,956 vehicles sold.

Some losers: Sales of the Escape were down 10.4% to 12,290 in August compared with the year-ago period. Despite Lightning sales rising, sales of the F-Series in total dipped 3.4% to 68,318 units sold in August.

At Lincoln, only the Navigator and Corsair saw sales gains. The Corsair, which Ford will stop producing by year-end, sold 2,526 units in August, a 8.6% gain. The Navigator saw a 2.5% sales gain to 1,624 units sold.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/09/06/USNK/86016128007-20230405-t-165518-z-201621158-rc-2-f-80-agip-39-rtrmadp-3-autoshownewyork.JPG?crop=3078,1732,x0,y160&width=3078&height=1732&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-09-06 15:02:58.828956

The California-based company cited insurmountable financial pressures, including failed attempts to secure investor funding and generate sufficient sales, leading to the closure of its facilities in Michigan and California as well.

The decision, announced this week, marks a significant setback for North Carolina’s burgeoning electric-vehicle and renewable-energy ecosystem. State officials, who had celebrated the project as a landmark economic win just a year ago, confirmed that the Rocky Mount-area factory is now off the table, leaving local communities grappling with dashed expectations.

A Promising Start Derailed by Market Realities

Natron’s trajectory had seemed promising. In August 2024, the company unveiled plans for what would have been the first U.S. gigafactory dedicated to sodium-ion batteries, a technology touted for its potential to offer cheaper, more abundant alternatives to lithium-ion counterparts. Governor Roy Cooper heralded the announcement, noting it would inject nearly $1.4 billion into Edgecombe County and create high-paying jobs in manufacturing and research.

According to reports from WRAL, the state approved an incentives package worth up to $56.3 million to lure Natron to the Kingsboro megasite, positioning it as one of the largest economic development deals in eastern North Carolina in recent years. This move aligned with broader efforts to bolster the state’s clean-energy profile, attracting companies focused on sustainable technologies amid global supply-chain shifts away from lithium dependencies.

Financial Strains and Operational Halts

However, cracks began to appear earlier this summer. By July, Natron paused its North Carolina plans due to funding shortfalls, as detailed in an article from the Raleigh News & Observer. The company struggled to raise capital in a competitive market where investor enthusiasm for battery startups has waned amid economic uncertainties and fluctuating raw-material prices.

The final blow came this month, with Natron confirming it would end all operations effective immediately. Sources from CleanTechnica highlighted “strong financial pressures” that rendered the business unprofitable, despite the technology’s advantages in safety and scalability for applications like data centers and electric vehicles.

Implications for Regional Economies and Industry Trends

The fallout extends beyond North Carolina. In Michigan, where Natron had operations, similar job losses are rippling through local supply chains. Industry analysts point to this closure as a cautionary tale for the battery sector, where hype around next-generation technologies often outpaces commercial viability. Sodium-ion batteries, while promising due to their use of plentiful sodium instead of scarce lithium, face hurdles in energy density and market adoption.

State commerce officials, as reported by NC Commerce, expressed disappointment but emphasized resilience in pursuing other clean-energy investments. The Kingsboro site remains available, potentially attracting new suitors in a sector still hungry for domestic manufacturing capacity.

Lessons for Future Investments in Emerging Tech

For industry insiders, Natron’s demise underscores the volatility of scaling innovative energy solutions. While the company secured partnerships and initial funding rounds, it couldn’t bridge the gap to mass production amid rising interest rates and investor caution. Comparisons to other battery ventures, such as those in lithium-iron-phosphate, reveal a pattern: success hinges on not just technological edge but also robust financial backing and timely market entry.

Looking ahead, North Carolina’s economic developers are likely to scrutinize incentives more closely, balancing optimism with due diligence. As one expert noted in coverage from the Carolina Journal, this episode highlights the risks of over-reliance on speculative tech firms in state-led growth strategies.

Broadening Horizons Amid Setbacks

Yet, the closure isn’t entirely devoid of silver linings. The groundwork laid for the Kingsboro megasite—improved infrastructure and workforce training—could accelerate future projects. Broader industry shifts, including federal incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act, continue to fuel interest in U.S.-based battery production, potentially filling the void left by Natron.

In the end, this development serves as a reminder of the high-stakes nature of the energy transition, where innovation must align with economic realities to thrive.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/xai-tmp-imgen-d2658df3-993e-4a1b-895b-8615664c145b.jpeg,N,,2025-09-06 15:03:11.756075

As the country pushes for greener power and energy independence, the agreement marks a major step toward making solar not just cleaner but truly local.

Starting in late 2026, Corning will supply solar wafers from its Michigan factory that T1 will use to make solar cells at a new facility in Austin, Texas. Those cells will then be assembled into panels at T1's existing Dallas-area plant.

T1 CEO Daniel Barcelo said in a statement, per Reuters: ""This is American companies building in America and protecting American energy security.""

The timing is key. With solar demand rising and new federal rules favoring American-made components, this deal reduces dependence on China, currently the world's leading wafer producer, and boosts both clean energy and U.S. manufacturing.

By making solar panels cheaper and more locally available, the deal could help lower energy costs for households while also cutting harmful carbon pollution by replacing fossil fuels with clean, homegrown power.

It also supports thousands of U.S. manufacturing jobs, keeping the benefits of the clean energy transition rooted in local communities.

Thanks to deals like the one between T1 Energy and Corning, more affordable, American-made solar panels are on the way, making installing solar the ultimate home energy hack.

Once panels are installed, your electricity costs can drop to near zero. If you are curious to learn more about installing solar in your home, EnergySage provides a free service that can help you compare quotes from vetted local installers with the potential of saving up to $10,000 on installations.

This year’s fire season has been the worst in European history, driven in part by lightning-caused wildfires in Spain.
Despite these regional differences, the result was clear: virtually everyone will be dealing with more wildfire risk in the future.
More smoke from more lightning-caused fires may also coat glaciers in Canada, Greenland and Europe with dark particles that can make them melt more quickly.
Due to their remote nature, lightning-caused wildfires also tend to drain emergency response capacity away from urban areas.","The climate crisis will continue making lightning-sparked wildfires more frequent for decades to come, which could produce cascading effects and worsen public safety and public health, experts and new research suggest.

Lightning-caused fires tend to burn in more remote areas and therefore usually grow into larger fires than human-caused fires. That means a trend toward more lightning-caused fires is also probably making wildfires more deadly by producing more wildfire smoke and helping to drive a surge in air quality issues from coast to coast, especially over the past several years.

Over the last 40 years, thunderstorms and other weather conditions favoring lightning have been happening more often across many parts of the US west, including western Washington, western Oregon, the California Central valley, and higher elevations throughout the Rocky Mountains.

This trend isn’t just in the US. This year’s fire season has been the worst in European history, driven in part by lightning-caused wildfires in Spain. In Canada, huge fires this year have burned more than 200% of normal forest area, the vast majority of which were caused by lightning.

Despite the well-documented trend toward worsening fires, most climate models have been too coarse to resolve how the relationship between lightning and wildfires will change as the climate crisis deepens.

A new study published last week is the first to use machine learning techniques to tackle this problem, simultaneously looking at future changes in lightning frequency and changes in weather variables like air temperature, humidity, wind and soil moisture that can predict how likely a fire is to spread.

“The overall signal is that we will have more risk of lightning-caused fires,” said Dmitri Kalashnikov, a climate scientist at the Sierra Nevada Research Institute at University of California-Merced and the study’s lead author.

The findings come as this year’s wildfire season in the US is shifting into high gear in a manner eerily similar to what Kalashnikov imagines for the future – lurching forward after a series of dry thunderstorms tore through California earlier this week.

Thousands of lightning strikes this week have sparked at least 20 new fires and burned tens of thousands of acres across California’s Central valley and into the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, with one fire destroying several structures in the Gold Rush-era settlement of Chinese Camp east of Modesto.

Kalashnikov’s team found that some places, like the inland Pacific north-west, will see a surge of lightning with a relatively small increase in overall fire risk due to a moistening environment. Other places, like the desert south-west, will see an increase in wildfire risk without much of a change in the number of days with lightning due to an overall trend towards more pervasive drought.

Despite these regional differences, the result was clear: virtually everyone will be dealing with more wildfire risk in the future. In fact, Kalashnikov’s team found future increases in the number of lightning-caused wildfires across a robust 98% of the western US “due to more lightning, or more fire weather, or both”, he said.

In a future world with limited firefighting resources, the implications of more lightning-caused wildfires are worrying.

Over a recent 15-year span, wildfire smoke killed about a thousand people in the US each year. A surge in lightning-caused fires could cause America’s smoke epidemic to take the lives of potentially more than 20,000 people a year by mid-century.

In addition to the increase in wildfire risk, Kalashnikov’s study found the biggest impact from the expected increase in thunderstorms and lightning across some parts of the west could be an increase in flash flooding and mudslides, especially in recently burned areas. More smoke from more lightning-caused fires may also coat glaciers in Canada, Greenland and Europe with dark particles that can make them melt more quickly.

Due to their remote nature, lightning-caused wildfires also tend to drain emergency response capacity away from urban areas.

Even today, a sudden lightning storm “can stretch resources really, really thin” for weeks during peak wildfire season, said Max Moritz, a University of California Cooperative Extension wildfire specialist and adjunct professor at University of California-Santa Barbara.

“Maybe a week or two later you may have a big Santa Ana wind event,” said Moritz, “then you have a real recipe for catastrophe.”

When coupled with the trend of urbanization of wildfire-prone areas that we are seeing across the west, a world with worse wildfires could place additional pressure on the insurance industry which is digesting billions of dollars of claims from this year’s fires in Los Angeles alone.

In the US, firefighting resources are stretched thin nationwide as a result of the Trump administration’s cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Park Service and a host of other federal agencies with staff throughout the west. As of late July, more than one-quarter of all firefighting jobs remained vacant at the US Forest Service, and a recent immigration raid within an active firefighting crew in Oregon has reportedly reduced firefighter morale.

Moritz sees a possible partial solution – change the way we build cities in fire-prone regions.

In addition to instituting basic fire safety building codes, Moritz envisions agricultural buffers surrounding cities that could effectively shield homes and people from encroaching fire.

“There’s a growing awareness now that live fuel moisture, the amount of water in green living twigs and leaves, is also a really strong control on fire dynamics,” said Moritz. “That’s what we have here in Santa Barbara. We’ve got an existing old agricultural belt that’s relatively thin. In the places where it still exists, wildfires cannot sweep out of the national forest and into neighborhoods.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/647c5161307ec6e2a2dc62a970a364bf67967cda/683_0_6827_5464/master/6827.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9e438507f240b9864b85e1b73e9ec7c6",N,,2025-09-06 15:03:06.591551

Legal challenges to federal incentives, regulatory rollbacks, and geopolitical tensions are reshaping the industry’s trajectory. For investors, the implications are profound: automakers are recalibrating strategies, energy markets are reconfiguring supply chains, and sector rotations are accelerating. Understanding these dynamics is critical for navigating the next phase of the EV revolution.

Automakers: From All-Electric Hype to Pragmatic Pivots

The expiration of the federal EV tax credit at year-end 2025 has forced automakers to abandon earlier all-electric ambitions. General Motors, for instance, has scaled back its 2030 EV production targets, shifting to a hybrid model that includes internal combustion engines (ICE) and plug-in hybrids [4]. This pivot reflects a broader industry trend: Hyundai and Honda are retooling factories to produce multiple vehicle types, while Ford has delayed battery plant expansions due to uncertain demand [1].

Regulatory uncertainty is compounding these challenges. The Trump administration’s 2025 rule banning critical minerals from “foreign entities of concern” has forced automakers to reconfigure supply chains at significant cost. For example, GM’s partnership with Australian lithium producers and Tesla’s vertical integration of battery production highlight the scramble to comply with new sourcing mandates [3]. Meanwhile, tariffs on Chinese EVs and batteries—accounting for 60% of global EV sales—have further strained domestic producers [2].

Energy Markets: Resilience Amid Disruption

Battery manufacturers and renewable energy firms are adapting to a post-incentive era. The Inflation Reduction Act’s (IRA) Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit (§45X) remains a lifeline, but its stringent sourcing criteria—requiring 65% of materials to be U.S.-sourced—have spurred vertical integration. Companies like Panasonic and LG Chem are consolidating production facilities to meet these thresholds, while startups are exploring alternative chemistries to bypass supply chain bottlenecks [1].

Grid operators, meanwhile, are deploying smart technologies to manage EV-driven demand. Time-of-use pricing, vehicle-to-grid (V2G) systems, and AI-driven load management are gaining traction as utilities seek to balance renewable energy integration with peak demand [5]. California’s ongoing legal battle with the DOJ over truck emissions standards underscores the state’s role as a regulatory bellwether, with its policies still driving 30% of U.S. EV adoption despite federal rollbacks [5].

Investor Strategies: Navigating Volatility and Long-Term Themes

For investors, the EV sector’s volatility demands a dual approach: hedging against regulatory risks while capitalizing on enduring trends. Q2 2025 data reveals a sector in flux: Tesla’s Cybertruck sales plummeted 50%, while GM’s Equinox EV doubled its sales to 78,000 units [1]. Such divergences highlight the importance of stock-specific fundamentals over broad sector bets.

Sector rotation is accelerating as investors seek defensive plays. European infrastructure funds, for instance, attracted $100 billion in inflows in Q2 2025, reflecting a shift toward regulated utilities and grid modernization [4]. Conversely, U.S. equity funds faced outflows amid trade tensions and policy uncertainty. Yet long-term themes—such as AI-driven electrification and critical minerals—remain intact. Nickel and lithium producers, despite 50% of global nickel supply operating at a loss, are seeing government-backed rebalancing efforts [2].

Conclusion: Strategic Exposure in a Fragmented Landscape

The EV sector’s future hinges on navigating regulatory fragmentation. Automakers must balance short-term pragmatism with long-term electrification goals, while energy markets will need to innovate to offset supply chain constraints. For investors, the key lies in diversification: pairing exposure to resilient subsectors (e.g., grid infrastructure, critical minerals) with active hedging against policy risks. As one industry analyst notes, “The EV transition isn’t over—it’s just becoming more complicated.” [3]",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-06 18:03:25.030335

The EPA previously moved to fire a handful of employees late last week, but now it is taking disciplinary action against more than 130 employees also suspected of signing the letter, the representative said. These employees were sent letters indicating they would be suspended for 14 days without pay.

The reason cited in the letters is for “conduct unbecoming of a federal employee,” the representative said, noting that is highly unusual, if not unprecedented, under the circumstances.

“These workers bravely voiced concerns about harmful changes at the Agency that threaten the lives of every American. And we know the administration’s motives are not about government efficiency or advancing public safety. Placing these workers on leave and now firing or suspending them months later has wasted over 47,000 work hours and $2 million.

Three automakers benefit from increased EV sales

The $7,500 federal tax credit for buying an electric vehicle will officially end on September 30, 2025. Then poof, that massive EV incentive will be history.

Some states will continue providing tax credits until funds run out. However, they’re much lower than $7,500. For example, Maine offers $2,500.

This has started a fire under some drivers, pressuring them to get the best electric vehicle deal possible before prices increase.

Electric Ford models have benefited from a year-over-year sales increase of 20%. The Ford Mustang Mach-E and Ford F-150 Lightning have ballooned to about 10,671 units per month.

Kia has also enjoyed increased sales. The Kia EV9 has a 54% sales increase over last month, with 2,679 units sold.

According to Index Box, the smaller Niro EV has experienced sales increases of 39% and 57%. Kia has had increasing electric vehicle sales for the past four consecutive months.

Hyundai is the third automaker with booming electric car success. Its total sales increased by 12.0% compared to last month.

Electric vehicles are responsible for 32% of the total sales volume. Sales for one of my favorite electric SUVs, the Hyundai Ioniq 5, increased by 60%.

Crews have successfully drilled more than 18,437 feet to tap Sweetwater County’s Madison Limestone formation. The engineering feat, which took months, is a major step toward establishing what developers hope will be one of the largest carbon dioxide storage projects in the U.S.

At 3.5 miles, it’s the deepest Class VI carbon dioxide injection well in the U.S., according to project officials, and it is the second well completed for the Sweetwater Carbon Storage Hub project. It is part of the public-private Wyoming CarbonSAFE program, which aims to identify geologic formations to permanently store carbon dioxide from industrial facilities in the region.

The average depth for an oil or natural gas well in Wyoming is about 8,000 feet or 1.5 miles, according to industry sources. Anything more than 12,000 feet is considered “deep,” by industry standards. The deepest petrol well in Wyoming is nearly 26,000 feet, in the Madden formation near the Lost Cabin gas plant in north-central Wyoming, according to the Petroleum Association of Wyoming.

The first well for the Sweetwater Carbon Storage Hub reached a depth of just over 16,000 feet.

“This deeper well gives us a more complete picture of the subsurface, reinforcing our commitment to building scalable, practical carbon solutions for Wyoming’s key industries,” Frontier President and Co-Chief Executive Officer Robby Rockey said in a prepared statement.

The new well, referred to as J1-15, will provide a wealth of new data to potentially confirm years of previous modeling, which has so far suggested the Madison Limestone is capable of holding large volumes of carbon dioxide. Targeting several geologic strata, the Sweetwater Carbon Storage Hub could hold more than 350 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to Frontier.

For scale, a typical passenger vehicle emits about 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

Carbon dioxide capture and storage vision

The University of Wyoming’s School of Energy Resources partnered with the U.S. Department of Energy about 10 years ago on the CarbonSAFE Initiative. The vision is to advance the use of carbon capture technologies — filtering carbon dioxide from smokestacks — by providing a place to put the greenhouse gas.

It’s a major pillar of Gov. Mark Gordon’s Decarbonizing the West energy policy initiative, which he has said will help keep Wyoming’s fossil fuels in the nation’s energy mix while building a new commercial sector to reduce the nation’s industrial carbon dioxide emissions.

In addition to the Sweetwater Carbon Storage Hub project, exploration and validation efforts are underway at Echo Springs in Carbon County and at the Dry Fork Station coal-fired power plant in Campbell County. Apart from the Wyoming CarbonSAFE efforts, Tallgrass Energy is exploring a carbon sequestration project in Laramie County.

Frontier Infrastructure, a division of Dallas-based Tailwater Capital, is the primary private partner for the Sweetwater Carbon Storage Hub. The $54 million project is backed by about $43 million in federal money, according to project officials. It’s unclear, so far, exactly which companies and gas-emitting facilities might sign on to offload their carbon dioxide, but Frontier has indicated that local trona mines and soda ash processing facilities in the southwest corner of the state will serve as its “anchor” clientele.

One potential client, the Project Bison direct-air capture partnership between Carbon Capture Inc. and Frontier Carbon Solutions, is no longer active, according to those familiar with the project. Despite the Trump administration’s efforts to ease emission regulations, many still see carbon capture and carbon storage as a growing industry in the U.S. and abroad.

Frontier Infrastructure, for its part, is dedicated to “empowering industries to meet their carbon reduction goals” and helping to ensure “that the region remains competitive in an evolving global market,” according to its website.

As for the security of existing federal funding for the Sweetwater Carbon Storage Hub efforts, it is currently “obligated” through February, according to an SER official close to the project.

In an emergency court filing Friday, the company said a Portland judge has set up an “impossible schedule” of 160 jury trials “week after week” over 2 1/2 years. The trials are for small groups of individual homeowners to seek millions of dollars in monetary damages for homes and businesses destroyed by the blazes four years ago, PacifiCorp said.

The unrelenting pace of the trials “imperils the operations of an essential public utility on which millions of customers depend” and threatens to “impose a crushing financial burden” on the largest electric grid operator in western US, according to the filing.

The company already has been hit with almost $500 million in damages for about 90 plaintiffs following a jury’s finding in 2023 that PacifiCorp was negligent for failing to shut off power lines ahead of a big wind storm. More than 1,900 fire victims in western Oregon have yet to present evidence of damages to juries in a case that’s shaping up as one of the biggest in the state’s history.

While destructive wildfires are now an almost routine part of summer in the American West, PacifiCorp’s decision to take its chances with a jury in 2023 marked the first time a lawsuit over large-scale devastation blamed on a utility’s equipment went to a trial.

PacifiCorp has said it’s confident it will get the landmark verdict overturned on appeal. But it’s now asking a state appeals court to halt further damages trials until the appeal is resolved, which could take several years.

PacifiCorp representatives didn’t immediately respond outside regular business hours to a voice mail request for comment.

In a regulatory filing last month, PacifiCorp didn’t describe its financial risk from the 2020 fires in the same dire terms as the court filing. The company said it has paid more than $1 billion in settlements, and estimated that probable losses for the fires totaled about $2.7 billion at the end of June.

Lawyers for fire victims declined to comment on Friday’s filing. They argued in a filing last week that pausing the trials would be unfair, as the fires “left thousands of Oregonians homeless, struggling to make ends meet, and traumatized.”

In 2024, Berkshire Chairman Warren Buffett warned in his annual letter to investors that wildfires have turned utilities across western US into risky investments. Utilities in California, Colorado, Hawaii and Texas have also faced billions in fire liabilities.

PacifiCorp has explored options with Oregon regulators and lawmakers to minimize its wildfire exposure, including recouping its litigation losses from customers and capping damages for non-economic claims.

The charging and connectivity bench, which is manufactured by SELS Solar, costs over $5,000 but Max – as he’s commonly known – used his negotiating skills to bring the price down to the amount in the grant, which he pursued independently.

“The bench is a renewable energy source. It’s also a public amenity, which is a bonus,” he said Thursday while sitting on his futuristic bench, which is covered with solar panels that convert sunlight to electricity using photovoltaic cells.

“People from all over White Plains can come and have a place to sit, a place to charge, free WiFi and Bluetooth,” Max said, adding that it is the only such bench in the city of some 60,000 residents.

For pedestrians who wish to do more than stop for a rest and figuratively recharge, the SB1020 stainless steel bench features USB charging ports, an inductive charging pad, WiFi connectivity and Bluetooth. The various options are displayed with blue logos on either side of the armrests.

“I want to try and make a change. If I can do this with $5,000, imagine what the city can do with a budget of $100,000,” Max said. “I want this to be a stepping stone for the city to implement more renewable energy sources. “This is a testament for what White Plains can do,”

Max said he was grateful for the city and thanked its leadership, the library and Public Works crews for their roles in bringing the project to fruition.

The student, who has attended the district’s schools since kindergarten, also praised WPHS and his teachers over the years.

“White Plains High School is a really good place and I love the learning atmosphere. The teachers really facilitate learning and make it more enjoyable,” said Max, whose brother, Josh, is entering the 10th grade.

He is already applying to colleges with the goal of entering the field of finance after first considering a career in computers.

“I used to gravitate toward computer science but with the job market right now it’s not that sustainable. So right now, finance is my go-to option,” Max said confidently.",https://yonkerstimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/max.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 15:01:35.726215

That momentum is at risk of slowing as the accelerated phaseout of tax credits makes wind and solar projects more expensive.
In addition, blue states including California and New York are still pushing to expand their clean power fleets.
Following the passage of Trump’s tax-and-spending law, BloombergNEF’s revised estimate for new wind, solar and energy storage additions in the US through 2035 is 26% lower than previously projected.","President Donald Trump has launched an unprecedented attack on wind and solar power as he seeks to reshape the US energy landscape and reverse the green agenda put forward by his predecessor.

Since Trump returned to office in January, his administration has taken aim at projects on federal lands and oceans, stopping work on wind farms, revoking permits, and making it more difficult for new renewable energy developments to secure approval. He’s also weakened the economics of wind and solar projects more broadly, pushing legislation through Congress that phases out key tax breaks and moving to tighten access to these incentives.

The broadsides have thrown the US clean energy industry into crisis, putting billions of dollars of investment at risk and threatening thousands of jobs. It’s a sharp reversal from just three years ago, when the sector hailed the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act under then-President Joe Biden as the most significant piece of climate legislation in US history.

Why does Trump dislike renewables?

Trump has criticised solar and wind as being unreliable and expensive. He’s called for more power to be generated from fossil fuels, namely natural gas and coal, as well as nuclear.

Renewables generation is intermittent as the sun isn’t always shining nor the wind blowing. But developers are increasingly turning to batteries to store surplus power and discharge it to the grid when needed.

Trump also isn’t a fan of how renewable power installations look, describing solar projects as “big ugly patches of black plastic that come from China” and mar farmland.

He’s been a vehement critic of wind turbines for years, falsely claiming they cause cancer and deriding them as bird-killing eyesores. Before his first presidential term, Trump lost a legal challenge in the UK to prevent an offshore wind project from being built within sight of a golf course he owns in Aberdeen, Scotland.

“Windmills are a disgrace,” he said in July after a visit to the course. “They hurt everything they touch. They’re ugly. They’re very inefficient. It’s the most expensive form of energy there is.” Looking at the levelised cost of electricity the long-term price a power plant needs to break even offshore wind is much more expensive than a new gas-fired facility, but it’s cost-competitive with coal and cheaper than nuclear, according to BloombergNEF’s assessment published in February. Meanwhile, onshore wind, as well as solar, is cheap enough to compete with a new-build gas plant.

How has Trump sought to curb wind and solar developments?

The Trump administration has harnessed its oversight of millions of acres of federal land and waters, where developers need government authorisation to build. While these areas are being made easier to explore for the oil and gas industry as part of Trump’s “drill, baby, drill” agenda, the government is imposing standards that would essentially prevent new renewables installations.

On Trump’s first day back in office, he froze permitting for all wind projects on federal land and oceans, and indefinitely halted the sale of new leases for offshore wind development. He also directed the Interior Department to review the “necessity of terminating or amending any existing wind energy leases” and to identify “any legal bases for such removal.” Since then, a number of wind projects have been upended. This includes the Revolution Wind development off the coast of Rhode Island. The government issued an order halting construction of the project which is already 80% complete citing national security concerns. This sent shares of developer Orsted A/S to record lows and added to the Danish company’s mounting troubles. Orsted’s Revolution Wind LLC unit filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration in early September, seeking to overturn the stop-work order so that it can finish the project.

For developers hoping to get past the planning stage, Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum has ordered that all solar and wind projects on federal lands require his personal sign-off, which could mire the approval process in red tape. The department said it’s acting in accordance with Trump’s order to end “preferential treatment” for these technologies.

As part of this mandate, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management rescinded Biden-era decisions that earmarked coastal waters for future wind turbines. This covers more than 3.5mn acres, including in the Gulf of Mexico, the New York Bight, and off the coast of California and Oregon.

How has the Trump administration targeted renewables beyond federal land and waters?

Only 4% of operational US renewables capacity is located on federal land. While the government doesn’t have direct control over clean energy developments on private property, many of those projects still need federal approvals that are being held up. In addition, the Trump administration has been trying to make the economics of wind and solar less attractive.

Trump has branded efforts to combat climate change as the “Green New Scam” and vowed to do away with subsidies for these activities. The tax-and-spending law he helped push through Congress known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act phases out the tax credits for wind and solar projects years before they were due to expire. On top of this, the Treasury Department has issued guidance making it harder for developments to qualify for the incentives.

There could be bad news to come on the tariff front, too. Wind turbines and parts are already subject to the 50% duties Trump imposed on imported steel and aluminium products. But the Commerce Department has opened a so-called Section 232 investigation into the national security implications of importing wind energy components, which could lead to sector-specific levies.

It also opened a Section 232 probe into imports of polysilicon a key raw material for solar modules which could result in additional duties on imports.

How have these actions impacted the US clean energy industry?

The industry had been building momentum as solar and wind power almost tripled their share of US electricity generation over the past decade, topping 15%. But it’s now in a tough spot. Billions of dollars of new factories and clean energy projects have been cancelled, delayed or scaled back since the start of the year.

Clean energy advocacy group E2 estimates that $22bn worth of projects were scrapped or downsized from January to June, and more than half of the investment lost was in congressional districts represented by Republicans.

Trump’s crackdown on renewables will likely hit smaller and medium-sized companies harder because they lack the financial moat needed to survive the instability. Larger solar developers have expressed more cautious optimism, saying they’ve been able to start enough projects that qualify for the expiring tax credits in order to continue their projects for the next several years.

The nascent US offshore wind industry is perhaps in the most precarious position given it was just starting to take off before Trump re-entered the White House.

How is this affecting energy prices?

That’s a subject of huge debate and has become a hot-button political issue. Electricity prices nationally rose at more than twice the rate of overall inflation in the past year and remained at a record high in June.

While the Trump administration says that adding wind and solar to the grid has been pushing up the cost of electricity, data shows that increased spending on power lines and poles has been the biggest driver of utility bill hikes.

Utilities have been upgrading their grids to accommodate new sources of generation and demand, and network operators are also trying to improve resilience to extreme weather events and modernise infrastructure that was built in the 1960s and 1970s.

Higher electricity costs are a reflection of tight supply as well, as aging coal- and gas-fired plants retire and power consumption rises after years of relatively tepid growth. Demand is being propelled by industrial users and the power-hungry data centres behind artificial intelligence. Slowing the deployment of renewables could exacerbate the situation.

The phaseout of wind and solar incentives under Trump’s tax-and-spending law could raise average US household energy bills by $78 to $192 in 2035, and increase annual industrial energy expenditure by $7bn to $11bn, according to the Rhodium Group.

Where does this leave the outlook for US renewables?

The threat of the federal government pulling the plug on fully permitted and nearly complete assets could make renewables developers and project financiers more wary of making long-term investments in the US, even after Trump has left office. It could also create uncertainty for states such as Massachusetts and Rhode Island that are relying on offshore wind to meet growing power demand and decarbonise their grids.

Blue states won’t be the only ones facing challenges. In red Texas the top US state for wind generation and number two for solar behind California all but 6% of new capacity added to the grid since 2020 has come from renewables or batteries, fuelling the power needs of its growing economy. That momentum is at risk of slowing as the accelerated phaseout of tax credits makes wind and solar projects more expensive.

Despite the Trump administration’s roadblocks, the US clean energy buildout is expected to continue, albeit more slowly. Solar and batteries are faster to deploy than Trump’s favoured energy sources. There’s currently a multiyear manufacturing backlog for the combined-cycle turbines used in gas plants, while new nuclear capacity whether based on conventional or next-generation reactors is many years away.

And onshore wind and solar are expected to be cost-competitive even without subsidies, according to BloombergNEF. In addition, blue states including California and New York are still pushing to expand their clean power fleets.

But the outlook for the sector has certainly dimmed.

“For example, a lot of the proposals out at the legislature for setbacks and even the current law for wind energy. requires a 1.5 nautical setback from public airports, from hospitals, and from schools,” Roth said. “Nothing like that exists on the oil and gas side.”

Lawmakers have been debating new restrictions on renewable projects, including solar farms and energy storage facilities, raising questions about how far new developments should be located from homes or occupied structures. Roth urged caution.

“My prayer for our legislature is to be a good carpenter, right? Measure twice, only cut once,” Roth said. “We don't want to harm private rights. We don't want to cause danger around people.”

Political extremes and public frustration

Mitchell noted that recent disputes over energy development reflect the chaos of a political environment where ideas swing from one extreme to another. Roth agreed, adding that most Oklahomans aren’t engaged in the political noise.

“I think 80 percent of the public that’s in the middle is too busy to be on Facebook ranting with internet science,” Roth said. “I know a lot of Oklahomans who are working hard to get by. They may have two jobs, kids in daycare, and it's an expensive reality. Inflation is on the move, still upward, unfortunately.""

""The idea that politics has gotten strange is because I think people feel like they're keyboard warriors that sit behind a screen anonymously and can say whatever they want without any accountability,"" Roth said.

The rules will largely scrutinise whether industrial units are compliant with environmental regulation. The overall framework for monitoring and compliance within the existing environmental framework is presently supported by the Central Pollution Control Board, the Regional Offices of the Environment Ministry, and the State Pollution Control Boards/Pollution Control Committees. They have, however, been facing significant constraints in terms of manpower, resources, capacity and infrastructure. “These limitations have hampered their ability to comprehensively monitor and enforce environmental compliance across the vast number of projects and industries operating nationwide,” said a press statement by the Environment Ministry. This scheme aims to bridge the manpower and infrastructure deficits faced by regulatory authorities, thereby strengthening the effective implementation of environmental compliance mechanisms.

Under the new rules, private agencies can get themselves accredited as auditors. Much like chartered accountants, environment auditors can get themselves licensed and be authorised to evaluate the compliance of projects with environmental laws and their adherence with best practices in the prevention, control and abatement of pollution. Environmental regulation has, in recent years, transcended policing and bookkeeping. Given that human-caused climate change is seen as a problem that nations must collectively fix, new dimensions to environmental regulations have emerged. Thus, audits undertaken by these agencies can also be used for compliance with ‘Green Credit Rules’, under which individuals and organisations can gain tradeable ‘credits’ for afforestation, sustainable water management and waste management among other activities. Beyond industrial units, nearly every company in India will have to account for its direct and indirect carbon emissions. This will entail fairly complex accounting practices, which are beyond what Pollution Control Board officials can handle. However, preparing for the future should not be at the expense of compromising core responsibilities.

Corporate travellers are switching from the East to the West Coast with demand for US West Coast corporate housing across key locations including California, Washington, Seattle and Silicon Valley rising by 44% YOY for the last quarter. At the same time, ongoing legislation changes and uncertainty ahead of the upcoming mayoral election scheduled for November coupled with average daily rate (ADR) rising 41% YOY for the last quarter, are also impacting the decline in corporate demand for New York. These are some of the findings in SilverDoor’s latest Quarterly Market Update report published today. With enquiries for New York City down by nearly a third – 29% - for the first half of 2025 compared to the same period last year, it has been replaced by Dubai in the top five cities for corporate demand according to the latest SilverDoor booking data:

London

Singapore

Madrid

Amsterdam

Dubai

Corporate demand and mobility are growing from the advancing technology sector which is continuing to increase its footprint across the West Coast and towards the southern states. The advance of AI and machine learning investment is spearheading the combined 44% growth in demand YOY for this quarter across Seattle and California’s Silicon Valley. Likewise further south, Houston in particular continues to offer comparatively lower operating costs, more favourable tax rates and a significantly lower ADR compared to New York such that as corporates continue to diversify operations beyond core cities, bookings for the popular Texas city are up 58% YOY this quarter.

The ever-advancing growth in AI investment is also having a ripple effect across the Pacific into the APAC region. Whilst Singapore demand remains high, it is starting to soften, with a 10% decline in demand YOY and ADR also following suit with a similar 13.5% decline YOY for the last quarter. Conversely, growth in AI demand globally has meant growth in demand for semiconductor manufacturing particularly in Taiwan. Likewise tech sector and cloud service growth is impacting demand in Tokyo – both destinations are reporting triple figure growth of 600% and 154% increase in bookings respectively for this quarter YOY. Across EMEA it is the renewable energy sector that has delivered significant growth in destinations to more coastal locations. Investment in solar power and offshore wind farms, particularly in Spain, has resulted in a marked shift in corporate demand as bookings for a number of destinations including Bilbao, Valencia and Zaragoza are all on the rise. Bilbao bookings have increased by 50% in the last quarter compared to the same period in 2024, Zaragoza bookings are up five-fold, and the number of room nights booked in Valencia in the last quarter is up 380% YOY. An increase of bookings by 65% YOY for the last quarter has seen Dubai claim a place in the top five with growth in demand for the region primarily coming from not only an increase in extended stays but also an increase in relocation assignees from the financial, law and pharmaceutical sectors, all of which are increasing investment across Dubai and the Middle East. Commenting on the report, Martin Klima, SilverDoor Chief Customer Officer, said, “These latest demand trends reflect a continuing wider shift in both corporate travel and operating policies. As businesses continue to balance their own growth plans against wider geopolitical and economic landscapes, diversifying operations and locations can be one way to achieve just that. Growth in regions beyond the more traditionally popular hubs like New York City towards cities in western and southern US states, and likewise the significant APAC demand growth in Taiwan, indicate where corporates are committing to investing their funds and placing their people. “As AI, technology, and renewable energy investment continues, it will be interesting to watch how the diversification trend evolves in the coming months and the impact it will have on demand across both the serviced apartment and wider accommodation sector both, from a short-term and longer-term perspective. “Growth in serviced apartment usage also comes with a shift in how corporate travellers are choosing their accommodation. Guests are increasingly keen to return to a particular apartment or operator if and when budgets and policy allow, particularly for longer stays where assignees have come to know and trust a specific operator. Pointing to more brands now having a strong presence in different markets and delivering consistent levels of service and quality throughout their portfolio, this brings with it the potential for increased loyalty across the sector.” The full SilverDoor Market Update is now available to read here *Figures from SilverDoor’s own booking data.

Brian is a member of the Farm & Forest Growers Cooperative, a network of small farms and nurseries that grow climate-adaptive tree seeds into seedlings, and then sell the seedlings to reforestation agencies and individuals.
“Minnesota has a massive need for tree seedlings,” Ingmire said.
He's also been selling seedlings at his Bemidji Natural Choice Farmers Market booth, and says having them there gives him an opportunity to talk about the project.
We’ve got different insect pests and fungal pests that are putting stressors on trees just because of the temperature extremes.","NARY — Brian Ingmire’s mission to help reforest northern Minnesota with trees from south of here became a lot more important after the June 21 storm that leveled millions of trees in the Bemidji area.

Ingmire and his wife, Trina, own the 10-acre New North Farm southeast of Bemidji in Hubbard County. They sell Certified Naturally Grown produce at Bemidji’s Natural Choice Farmers Market on Saturdays. They also raise sheep and chickens.

Brian is a member of the Farm & Forest Growers Cooperative, a network of small farms and nurseries that grow climate-adaptive tree seeds into seedlings, and then sell the seedlings to reforestation agencies and individuals.

The program is headed by Dr. Julie Etterson, Distinguished McKnight Professor at the University of Minnesota Duluth’s Swenson College of Science and Engineering.

“Minnesota has a massive need for tree seedlings,” Ingmire said. “Something like 10 million trees are needed every year at a minimum. And we have a lot of forest disturbance, whether it’s fires or wind events.”

Ingmire figures he has about 30,000 tree seedlings on his farm, and about two-thirds of them will be available for purchase this fall. Online orders can be placed at climatesmarttrees.com . He's also been selling seedlings at his Bemidji Natural Choice Farmers Market booth, and says having them there gives him an opportunity to talk about the project.

New North Farm is one of 24 members of the cooperative. Ingmire is growing several varieties, including red oak, burr oak, yellow birch and silver maple. All are collected from about 200 miles south and then started up north.

“I can tell you where their parent tree came from,” Ingmire said. “They should be able to handle the changes in temperature extremes. We’ve got different insect pests and fungal pests that are putting stressors on trees just because of the temperature extremes. These trees should have the genetic ability to deal with that kind of extreme.”

The need for reforestation was certainly exacerbated in the Bemidji area after the June storm. It is estimated that Beltrami County lost nine million trees, and many were also downed in parts of Hubbard and Cass counties.

“That number exceeds a lot of the nursery capacity that we have,” Ingmire said.

Trees that are purchased this fall should be planted right away to ensure their survival.

“Most of our sales will be done for spring planting,” Ingmire said, “but I would like to see as many available in the fall as possible. I think the trees do better when they're planted in the fall. But you've got a very narrow window here in northern Minnesota between when trees drop their leaves and when the ground freezes. Some years you've got a month to get all that done, and some years you've got two weeks.”

He said trees that are not sold this fall will be kept in cold storage at UMD and will be available in the spring.

Listening to Ingmire talk about the seedling program, his gardens and forest ecology, it’s clear to see his passion for science and the environment.

""In a lot of ways it’s a spiritual thing for me,"" he said. ""You either set everything aside and you take a preservationist mindset where nature's best left without man touching it, or you recognize that we as humans have a unique role and responsibility to participate and be part of the natural world. There's really no separation between the two of them.""

He noted that the impacts humans have are global, but that these impacts start on a local level.

""One tree at a time, or one farm that's growing vegetables that feed people. So you can choose to participate in a lot of different ways,"" Ingmire said. ""The way that I choose to participate is to imagine and envision what it could be, and then work to model that and make it happen. And help other people do the same.""

Ingmire's full-time job is with the Minnesota Department of Agriculture as a water certification specialist. It’s a position that allows for flexibility, especially during the growing season, and it also allows him to visit with farmers throughout the region.

He has a degree in natural resources and environmental maintenance from Ball State University in his native Indiana. He did graduate work at Western Kentucky University and Indiana University before becoming a science teacher at the junior college and high school level.

After that, he managed water quality programs for the Environmental Protection Agency and spent 13 years as a conservation planner and trainer with the United States Department of Agriculture.

The Ingmires moved to Minnesota nearly four years ago after he started his current position with the MDA. But finding the right place to live was a bit of a challenge for Brian and Trina.

“It was right in the middle of COVID,” Brian said. “Interest rates were starting to go up. Everybody was racing to get a place.”

The couple had planned to visit five properties in the Bemidji area, but by the time they arrived, three of them had been sold.

“The first one we looked at was just a nightmare,” Brian said. Even the farm they bought didn’t look right when they pulled into the snow-covered driveway.

“It looked horrible,” Brian said. “We didn’t have any photos of the inside of the house. The doors were open on the sheds when we pulled in. It hadn’t been plowed. But then we got into the house and it had a bank of south-facing windows and all the sun was shining through. We thought, ‘This is it. We can do this.’”

Fast forward four years, and Brian and Trina have created a pristine and productive farm, with a lot of sweat equity and a little help from their hungry sheep.

“I was looking at soil maps and thought it should be good,” Brian said. “It’s prime agricultural land. We had a lot of little surprises when everything thawed. There were piles of trash, it was all grown over and full of boxelder. Kind of daunting, but I was ready for it. I was just ready to have my own piece of land, and I had ideas I wanted to try out.”",https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/6270a4e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5712x4284+0+0/resize/1421x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F68%2F20%2Fa80e09dd49a3ae86822b44a6ae3b%2Fingmire2.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 12:08:39.440485

We continue to work towards this ambition.” Likewise, Google's Data Centers Sustainability webpage also maintains the net-zero carbon by 2030 pledge is still in place at the firm.
On the other hand, the Trump administration has been advancing its strategy on climate action and carbon emissions.","It appears that Google is starting to hide its internal climate advocacy goals from the public eye. The internet titan has silently removed its goal to ""pursue net-zero emissions"" across all operations by 2030 from its Sustainability webpage, as first spotted by Canada's National Observer.

An update to Google Sustainability's ""Operating sustainably"" landing page, now renamed to ""Our operations,"" has removed its first headline broadcasting Alphabet Inc.'s long-stated goal to achieve net-zero emissions across its operations and value chain by 2030. The new page adds details on Google's sustainability goals in recent hardware releases, but shirks any mention of a net-zero climate policy or a carbon footprint beyond the aluminum used in constructing Google Pixel phones.

After the National Observer first reported on the change, a spokesperson from Google clarified the company's carbon emission policy. ""Our most recent environmental report shows a 12% reduction in data center energy emissions in 2024,"" reads the press statement. ""This was achieved by bringing new clean energy online, even amidst increased energy demands. In 2021, we set out an ambition to reach net-zero emissions across all of our operations and value chain by 2030. We continue to work towards this ambition.”

Likewise, Google's Data Centers Sustainability webpage also maintains the net-zero carbon by 2030 pledge is still in place at the firm. But the wording around it has now shifted to framing the goal as more of a moonshot than a guarantee. This was seen as inevitable by many as in 2023 and 2024, Google transitioned away from its practice of buying carbon offsets to achieve a ""technically carbon neutral"" status, now striving for a more robust and substantial carbon effort.

Possible Reasons Behind the Change

Still, seemingly hiding the net-zero verbage from view on its flagship sustainability website is a noteworthy choice by Google. Two major shifts in 2025 may have something to do with the decision: Google's spiraling AI energy costs and the U.S. government's crackdown on climate change initiatives.

Google and other AI hyperscalers have been continually purchasing and building data centers to meet perceived AI demands since the field opened wide last year. As a result of Google's major strategy shift towards AI, the company announced that its greenhouse gas emissions climbed by 48% in the past year, noting then that this boom would make the 2030 goal a challenge.

On the other hand, the Trump administration has been advancing its strategy on climate action and carbon emissions. After taking down a number of government websites discussing climate change upon coming into power, the U.S. government has begun championing the use of ""incredibly clean"" coal power plants.""

Now that Google seems to be officially considering its climate plans as a long shot more than a real commitment, what its path forward looks like will likely be somewhat in flux.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZBz8tMdiR9FaRK5xeafByT.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 12:06:07.771924

The strategic adjustments at Spring Hill also include a temporary reduction in staffing levels, the memo also said.
About 700 employees will be laid off at Spring Hill, GM confirmed.
Still, Ford reported its retail EV sales skyrocketed by 19% to a total of 10,671 sold in August.","Spring Hill makes the Cadillac Lyriq SUV and Vistiq, while Fairfax is currently closed as the facility prepares to produce the Chevrolet Bolt EV. CAMI produces the BrightDrop electric delivery van.

The production changes come on the heels of partial shutdowns at the electric vehicle manufacturing plant Factory Zero, in Detroit-Hamtramck.

General Motors' Spring Hill Assembly plant in Tennessee is planning several weeks of downtime in the coming months, according to a memo obtained by the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network.

Additionally, the Detroit automaker told the Free Press on Sept. 4 that it is adjusting future production plans at its Fairfax Assembly plant in Kansas City, Kansas, and at its CAMI Assembly Plant line in Ontario, Canada.

Spring Hill makes the Cadillac Lyriq SUV and Vistiq, while Fairfax is currently closed as the facility prepares to produce the Chevrolet Bolt EV. CAMI produces the BrightDrop electric delivery van.

“General Motors is making strategic production adjustments in alignment with expected slower EV industry growth and customer demand by leveraging our flexible ICE and EV manufacturing footprint,” GM spokesman Kevin Kelly said in a statement.“ GM's U.S. manufacturing footprint remains our strength, and we are in the process of investing nearly $5 billion over the next two years to further increase domestic vehicle production, enabling the ability to assemble more than 2 million vehicles per year in the U.S.”

Spring Hill will close the week of Oct. 6 and the week of Thanksgiving, as well as the full month of December, according to the memo sent to employees Sept. 3. The change will impact vehicle assembly as well as the teams that assemble battery packs for EV batteries, GM confirmed. Ultium Cell employees will not be affected.

Separately, Fairfax Assembly, which ended production earlier this year of the Cadillac XT4 and the Chevrolet Malibu, is no longer planning to add a second shift once construction ramps up on the Bolt. GM said this summer it plans to begin assembly of the gas-powered Chevrolet Equinox in Fairfax by mid-2027.

Plans were to start with one shift in November, according to the company website, but now GM says it will wait on market conditions before making the decision to expand to a second shift.

Meanwhile, the production pause at CAMI will be extended through Nov. 17. CAMI Assembly had run two shifts while producing Chevrolet BrightDrop vehicles, but GM said in April that the plant would initiate temporary layoffs. Unifor said those layoffs would last through October. During this downtime, GM says it plans to complete retooling work to prepare the facility for production of the 2026 model year of commercial electric vehicles.

When production resumes, the plant will operate on a single shift for the foreseeable future — a reduction expected to impact 450 workers.

Factory Zero also altering plans

The production changes come on the heels of partial shutdowns at electric vehicle manufacturing plant Factory Zero, in Detroit-Hamtramck.

Last week, GM told employees that the plant would partially shut down some first- and second-shift production starting after Labor Day and that it would resume Oct. 6. Meanwhile, the temporary layoff in place for second-shift production that GM announced in April was extended until Oct. 6. The move impacted production of the GMC Hummer EV and Cadillac Escalade IQ and approximately 360 employees were laid off.

The strategic adjustments at Spring Hill also include a temporary reduction in staffing levels, the memo also said.

About 700 employees will be laid off at Spring Hill, GM confirmed.

Spring Hill Vehicle Assembly and the battery operations on site expect to be running on first shift only from January to May 2026, per the memo. Impacted employees will be placed on layoff status and may be eligible for sub-pay and benefits in accordance with the National UAW/GM contract.

“We understand this is difficult news. At the same time, it's important to remember Spring Hill has a bright future ahead,” the memo said. “We've earned multiple product allocations, including the next-generation Cadillac XT5 and the gas-powered Chevrolet Blazer, thanks to your strong business performance, high engagement and track record for launch excellence.”

EV sales are strong, but uncertain

Electric vehicle sales soared in July and August as buyers tried to take advantage of up to $7,500 in federal tax credits before the Sept. 30 deadline.

Automakers preparing for a slowdown are starting to make production announcements now, according to Sam Abuelsamid, vice president of market research at Telemetry.

“Given the situation with the tax credits going away at the end of the month, cars that would have been bought in the fourth quarter are being bought now,” he said. “Automakers are going to adjust their production in accordance with what they're selling.”

GM said Sept. 2 that sales of more than 21,000 EVs combined from Chevrolet, Cadillac and GMC set an all-time record for the automaker.

Still, the company is bracing for an EV sales falloff, and Duncan Aldred, GM senior vice president and president of North America, said in a statement the company would be mindful of its EV production plans.

“We’re expecting strong demand once again in September. The question, of course, is what’s next? There’s no doubt we’ll see lower EV sales next quarter after tax credits end Sept. 30, and it may take several months for the market to normalize,” Aldred said. “We will almost certainly see a smaller EV market for a while, and we won’t overproduce.”

On Sept. 3, Ford Motor reported gains in August U.S. retail sales, driven in a large part by EV sales. It's unusual because EV sales had been muted, given that demand for them had not been as strong as the industry had predicted it would be a few years ago. A lagging charging infrastructure and high price tags for EVs had hampered sales just 12 months ago.

According to Kelley Blue Book, the average transaction price for a new EV across all brands for July was $55,689. By comparison, the average transaction price in July for a new car in general was $48,841.

Still, Ford reported its retail EV sales skyrocketed by 19% to a total of 10,671 sold in August. But for the first eight months of the year, Ford's EV sales are down 5.7% at 57,888 sold compared with the year-ago period.

Analysts said any EV sales gains are not sustainable this year. That is why GM is making adjustments to production now.

Karl Brauer, executive analyst with iseecars.com told the Free Press that the EV sales spike will continue through the end of September across all EV models, “followed by a whipsaw” in the other direction as EV sales evaporate in the fourth quarter.

“It’s a predictable pattern, one we see whenever large purchase incentives are removed from the marketplace,” Brauer said.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/presto/2023/03/16/PDTF/0ec0d5ca-19cc-4f6a-b7da-a0b535b551f0-IMG_Cadillaclyriqevent05_1_.JPG?crop=2999,1687,x0,y152&width=2999&height=1687&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-09-06 12:05:15.712906

Sanjiv Malhotra emphasized the importance of keeping the supply chain within the United States and away from China, hoping that tariffs on Chinese goods will encourage more American businesses to seek out their products.

""This is the only production facility in North America making the cathode active material for this kind of lithium battery,"" said Malhotra.

Malhotra owns patents and developed technology that does not rely on nickel or cobalt, which are traditionally used in lithium batteries and are made in China.

""Lithium comes to us from North Carolina. Iron comes to us from Minnesota, and phosphate that comes to us from Florida,"" he said. ""It's all 100% U.S.-based supply chain.""

The Sparkz battery is developed through a three-step process: starting with the material, making the cell, and then creating the complete battery pack.

The batteries can power large grids or data centers for energy storage and commercial vehicles like ATVs, trucks, school buses and forklifts.

The factory has sparked the interest of the Sacramento Electric Vehicle Association, whose members received a behind-the-scenes look at how the batteries and materials are made.

""Even though Sparkz is maybe concentrating more on the stationary storage portion of it rather than car batteries, it's still something that we're interested in from the environmental side,"" said President Peter Mackin.

Malhotra said while Sparkz is producing this technology for energy needs now, they're also looking ahead to what's next.

""I think we've done it fairly efficiently. It hasn't taken us decades,"" he said. ""Let's see what the next five years looks like.""

Sparkz is currently hiring and will need to fill more positions as it continues to expand and fill the 130,000-square-foot warehouse.

Agen said building out nuclear power is the third prong of the Trump administration’s approach to winning the artificial intelligence race against China after extending the lifespans of aging coal plants that are retiring and increasing the efficiency of the existing electric grid.

In recent weeks, President Donald Trump has deployed a range of tactics to stop offshore wind expansion, which was a cornerstone of former President Joe Biden’s efforts to combat climate change but has struggled with soaring costs and supply chain snags.

Most notably, Trump’s Interior Department late last month issued a stop-work order on the Revolution Wind project off the coast of Rhode Island, which is 80% complete.

Agen dismissed criticism that revoking permits for nearly-completed renewable energy projects causes instability and uncertainty, saying the Trump administration is sending a signal that projects that will succeed will not be reliant on tax credits or subsidies.

“If you want to invest in a project that you can be financially viable in, and you’re not reliant on tax subsidies to do it, I think that’s the message that we’re trying to show and I think that we have seen success on the fossil fuels,” he said.

“With or without the tax credit, these improvements bring energy savings that lower energy bills,” he said.","The “one big beautiful bill” that President Donald Trump signed into law in July is set to upend many aspects of American life, including climate policy. The law, which Republicans backed en masse, not only derails the nation’s efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it could also strike a blow to consumers’ pocketbooks.

From a climate perspective, the legislation’s most significant rollbacks are aimed at industries such as renewable energy, not individuals. But there will be very real impacts for taxpayers hoping to decarbonize their homes.

The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, provided tax credits for climate-friendly purchases ranging from heat pumps to solar arrays through 2032. That time frame has been cut to as little as a few months.

“This bill is going to take away a lot of assistance from consumers,” said Lowell Ungar, director of federal policy for the nonprofit American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. He noted that two million people used the home improvement tax credit in its first year alone.

The good news is that the law does not affect the billions of dollars that the IRA already sent to state efficiency and electrification rebate programs, and that much of that money will remain available beyond the federal sunsets. But, Ungar added, the tax credits can still save people thousands of dollars before they vanish.

“If consumers are able to make the investment now,” he said, “it will help them out.”

For those looking to act, Grist shares a roundup of when credits will go away.

Buy an EV before October

New electric vehicles that meet federal domestic manufacturing requirements qualify for a tax credit of up to $7,500. While credits on foreign-made EVs aren’t offered directly to consumers, automakers do get them and often pass the savings along through leases. Used EVs under $25,000 that are purchased at a dealer are also eligible for up to a $4,000 credit.

All of this goes away on September 30. There will be no credits after that. Ultimately, this will make new electric vehicles more expensive and put the technology further out of reach for low- to moderate-income Americans.

The income caps on the EV credits still apply, limiting the benefit on new EVs to those households earning less than $300,000 and on used vehicles to those earning less than $150,000. There is an MSRP limit of $80,000 for new cars, too.

Strangely, the tax credit for installing an EV charger (up to $1,000) runs through June of next year.

Make home improvements by the end of the year

The remarkably vast Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit provides up to $2,000 toward qualified heat pumps, water heaters, biomass stoves, or biomass boilers. It offers another $1,200 toward efficiency upgrades such as insulation, doors, windows, and even home energy audits.

These are going away on December 31. All items must be “placed in service” by then to qualify, though a reminder: Tax credits lower your tax liability but don’t come back as rebates. You must have a tax bill to benefit, which may not be the case for certain low-income households.

Pay for solar this year

The most valuable IRA incentive being axed is the Residential Clean Energy Credit. It covers 30 percent of clean energy systems such as solar panels, wind turbines, and geothermal heat pumps, and there is no cap. With the average cost of a solar system in the U.S. just north of $28,000, that means a tax credit would be worth around $8,500. That credit vanishes at the end of this year, though the law refers to the “expenditures” being made by then, so that could mean paying for — but not necessarily installing — a system by then.

Like with other credits, Ungar suggests confirming any changes with a tax professional. He also said that the potential for higher tariffs is another reason to move quickly. But, he said, even after the credits go away, many of these improvements could still make financial sense over the long term.

“With or without the tax credit, these improvements bring energy savings that lower energy bills,” he said. “In some cases, improvements are going to be a no-brainer regardless.”",https://kvia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/grist-environmental-tax-credits_0.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 12:07:55.031852

Popularized in national energy policy discussions in the early 2000s, this strategy champions diversity in energy sources—such as coal, natural gas, solar and regional grid participation—rather than reliance on any single solution. For Kentucky’s electric cooperatives, it’s more than a slogan—it’s a commitment to reliability, affordability and innovation.

EKPC’s latest infrastructure investments reaffirm that commitment, expanding generation capacity by nearly a third while empowering co-op members with energy efficiency tools and safeguarding the future of Kentucky communities. EKPC provides electricity to 16 electric cooperatives that serve 1.1 million Kentucky residents in 89 counties.

“Diversification is really key to our portfolio,” says Don Mosier, EKPC’s executive vice president and chief operating officer. “And the projects that we’re adding today really contribute to that all of the above strategy.”

During the past three winters, EKPC has set new all-time peak demand records during extreme cold events when large amounts of electricity are used for heating. The cooperative forecasts growing day-to-day power consumption will exceed the capacity of its current fleet by 2030.

New natural gas unit at Cooper Station

EKPC plans to add a new 745-megawatt natural gas combined cycle unit at Cooper Station in Pulaski County, effectively tripling the plant’s capacity to provide power and meet future energy demands.

The new unit will bolster the regional transmission grid in southern Kentucky, and it comes as national energy monitors are warning of a shortage of electric power as the most reliable energy sources such as coal plants are prematurely shut down so utilities can comply with federal environmental standards.

“When you start talking about having random and rolling blackouts, that’s nothing that any of us want to experience,” says Chris Girdler, president and CEO of the Somerset-Pulaski Economic Development Authority. “And Cooper Station is historically—decade after decade—an incredible asset to making sure that those kinds of things don’t happen here.”

Coal and natural gas combos

Meanwhile, EKPC is protecting its most dependable electric-generating resources—existing coal-fired units—in the face of the EPA’s greenhouse gas rule that went final last year.

“And that rule basically states this: if you do nothing to your coal facilities, you must close those facilities by the end of 2031,” Mosier says. “Not that far away.”

EKPC plans to convert an existing coal-fueled unit at Cooper Station and all four coal units at Spurlock Station in Mason County to enable them to use both coal and natural gas as fuel.

With those changes, EKPC will ensure continued compliance with the existing greenhouse gas rule, even as the Trump administration attempts to implement reforms.

EKPC carefully studied but ultimately rejected the idea of capturing carbon dioxide emissions of the power plant, transporting and storing it.

“We found out that it would have devastated our members’ rates,” Mosier says. “And that’s totally unacceptable.”

“We are trying to prepare for the future, but the biggest thing is uncertainty,” says Alan Ahrman, EKPC’s board chairman. “It’s like a guessing game. What’s going to happen five years down the road?”

When the next generation reviews the bold decisions EKPC is making today, “I want them to look at it and say, we made a smart decision,” Ahrman says. “We did the best we could with the information we have.”

The co-firing projects will protect nearly half of EKPC’s existing generating capacity while reducing carbon dioxide emissions.

New natural gas plant in Casey County

EKPC plans to construct an innovative 214-megawatt natural gas power plant at a 100-acre site near Liberty, in Casey County.

Featuring 12 natural gas-fueled engine/ generator sets, the plant will be capable of rapidly starting and ramping up and down. This flexibility means the facility can support energy demands during peak usage hours or when solar facilities experience a reduction in output.

“Liberty Station will help to meet growing demand for electricity, while also strengthening the reliability of southern Kentucky’s electric grid and supporting intermittent renewables,” says Anthony “Tony” Campbell, EKPC’s president and CEO.

The plant is expected to be in operation by late 2028 and will create 23 new full-time jobs.

Expanded programs

Following a detailed cost-effective analysis, EKPC plans to more than double its investment in demand side management/energy efficiency programs, including increasing incentives for qualifying participants in the CARES low-income weatherization program.

Combined with existing programs, EKPC projects it can cumulatively reduce energy use by 69,792 megawatt-hours and cut winter peak by 38 megawatts by 2030.

Additional sources

EKPC recently secured a power purchase agreement for 100 megawatts of nuclear energy and plans to add 136 megawatts of solar capacity at facilities in Fayette and Marion counties.

“EKPC is taking steps to lower our greenhouse gas emissions intensity,” Mosier says.

“We are taking a comprehensive approach that safeguards reliability and cost-competitiveness, while boosting sustainability. Greater fleet diversity means access to low-cost energy when it is available, along with reliable, flexible power plants to keep electricity flowing when it is needed the most.”",https://d2fxn1d7fsdeeo.cloudfront.net/kentuckyliving.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/03102930/Cooper2_resized-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 13:02:54.432369

As summer turns to fall, we know cooler temperatures are around the corner, and we’ll be reaching for the thermostat more often.

Changes in energy policies eliminating renewable sources of energy like wind, solar and battery storage will decrease supply. This will result in higher costs for electricity and increased greenhouse gas pollution, contributing to global warming. Heating homes in the winter and cooling them in the summer is going to get more expensive as electricity costs increase. The risks of brownouts and blackouts will also increase.

New federal energy policies are putting a thumb on the scale favoring fossil fuels with greater subsidies while penalizing or eliminating renewable clean energy sources. The result will damage the environment and the economy.

The price of electricity is determined by supply and demand. Disruptive changes are underway for both.

On the demand side, virtually all planning models predict increased demand. The Northwest Power and Conservation Council predicts electricity in its four-state region could double in 20 years. The Pacific Northwest Utilities Conference Committee predicts demand increases equivalent to adding seven Seattle-sized cities to the power grid within the next decade.

In addition to traditional population and job growth, surging electricity demand is driven by data centers feeding a voracious appetite for artificial intelligence (AI), technology and crypto-currency. Microsoft, Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Meta (Facebook) and others are investing billions of dollars in data centers and they are in a hurry to bring them online as fast as possible.

Climate change is adding to new demand with increased charging capacity for electric vehicle (EV) transportation, and air conditioning. These new sources are increasing demand and accelerating timing for new energy availability.

On the supply side, disruptive change is driven by new tax policies in the so-called Big Beautiful Bill pushed by President Trump and Republicans, with the aim to effectively eliminate renewable energy sources: wind, solar and battery storage. The tax bill will subsidize fossil fuel development while phasing out tax credits for clean energy. It is part of a culture war in Trump’s fight against climate science. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin recently said we want to “drive a dagger through the heart of the climate change religion.”

As reported in the Seattle Times, “The tax plan, broadly seen as the linchpin to Trump’s agenda marks the president’s latest shot in his escalating fight against climate science.” U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said: “Washington State, stands to loose an estimated $8.7 billion in clean-energy investments.”

Renewable energy is cost-competitive with fossil fuels and costs are trending down. Renewable pricing is less volatile than fossil fuels and renewables do not generate greenhouse gases. What is more, there are no hidden “external” costs as with fossil fuels warming the planet.

Other disruptive changes include upgrading the transmission and distribution grid, and capital costs financing new infrastructure.

New demand presents challenges for the grid. Demand for AI data centers are localized while EVs and increased air conditioning are spread over larger areas. Sources for new power generation, including wind and solar, may be located some distance from where its needed. The grid must be upgraded to match supply with demand.

Financing new infrastructure presents additional challenges and risks for utilities and their customers. Utilities must make investment decisions for tomorrow’s capital needs based on current best estimates. New infrastructure and upgrades are typically financed with debt instruments between 10 and 30 years. Customers and rate payers are on the hook for these costs. Changes and uncertainty in energy markets — supply and demand — raise the risk of building capital infrastructure that fails to meet future needs. These are known as stranded assets and are borne by customers and rate payers regardless.

At a time when demand for energy is surging, the Trump administration’s response is to wage a crusade on climate science. The effect is eliminating the most cost effective and cleanest sources of energy and increasing greenhouse gas emissions. The consequences will be higher energy costs for consumers at homes and businesses, a less reliable energy supply and a warmer planet.

The winners in this mindless endeavor include China and Europe who are not waiting for the U.S. to get it’s act together on energy or climate policy (“Green revolution is booming; just not in the U.S.,” The Herald, Sept. 2). The losers in the short run will be consumers; you and me. The crusade against climate science is leading us into a new dark age; literally.

“Eco-nomics” is a series of articles exploring issues at the intersection of climate change and economics.

“The economic activities of our companies investing in the US and the rights and interests of our nationals must not be unfairly violated,” South Korean ministry spokesperson Lee Jae-woong said.

The ministry’s spokesperson added that “We conveyed our concern and regret through the US Embassy in Seoul today.” Korea sent officials to Washington and to the Hyundai plant to establish an on-site task force to deal with the matter.

The site spans nearly 3,000 acres total and includes an assembly facility, two battery plants, a weld shop, and several others for training, logistics, and more.

As the largest economic project in Georgia, the plant, including Hyundai’s suppliers, is expected to create nearly 40,000 jobs while drawing $12.6 billion into the state.

Federal agents walked into a massive Hyundai and LG Energy Solutions construction site yesterday and detained nearly 500 people on suspected immigration offenses. The site, near Savannah, Georgia, is the home of a future electric vehicle battery plant. On Instagram, video posted by an account with the name Alex Morales showed a group of people listening to a masked man who identifies himself as part of Homeland Security.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED DHS OFFICER: We need construction to cease immediately. We need all work to end on the site right now.

DETROW: Homeland Security Investigations says this was the largest single-site operation they have ever carried out. NPR's Camila Domonoske covers cars for NPR and joins us now. Hey there.

CAMILA DOMONOSKE, BYLINE: Hi.

DETROW: What do we know about this workplace raid so far?

DOMONOSKE: Yeah. So Homeland Security Investigations, which is the branch of ICE that carries out this kind of workplace raid, they say that they detained 475 people, most of them South Korean. Hyundai and LG Energy Solutions - both of those companies are headquartered in South Korea. Here's Special Agent Steven Schrank speaking at a press conference.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

STEVEN SCHRANK: Some that illegally crossed the border into the United States, some that came in through visa waiver and were prohibited from working, some that had visas and overstayed their visas.

DETROW: So who was employing the people who were detained?

DOMONOSKE: It's a good question. You know, in a project like this, there are really complicated webs of subcontractors and subcontractors to subcontractors. Hyundai says that it believes that nobody detained was directly employed by Hyundai Motor Company. LG Energy Solutions hasn't responded to NPR's requests for comment.

That Homeland Security official said that this raid was tied to, quote, ""allegations of unlawful employment practices and serious federal crimes,"" end quote. He did not provide more details on that, and there are no charges filed in this case right now. Officials say this is an ongoing investigation. It would be unusual if charges are eventually filed because immigration raids like this, where workers are detained - they don't often end with criminal charges for employers.

DETROW: Tell us more about where this raid happened.

DOMONOSKE: It's on this huge campus of buildings near Savannah, Georgia, that also includes a large factory where Hyundai is right now building electric vehicles. That factory was not directly affected by the raid. Production of vehicles didn't actually stop. But the battery plant that's under construction nearby, which is where the raid actually happened - it's an important part of the long-term plans for this facility 'cause the goal is to build not just electric vehicles, but the whole supply chain for these vehicles here in the U.S.

And that's important not just to Hyundai, but actually to the United States more broadly in this effort to try to compete with China over the future of electric vehicles. So Hyundai is investing some $26 billion in moving manufacturing to the U.S., including this project. It's a big deal for the company and for Georgia. The state's called it the largest economic development project in state history.

DETROW: And I understand you just heard back from Hyundai. What did they say?

DOMONOSKE: They said they're going to conduct an investigation into suppliers and their subcontractors to make sure they are all following employment law and other laws and regulations. Meanwhile, Congressman Buddy Carter, who represents the area surrounding the plant, posted on X that he applauded the Trump administration for taking bold action. And the South Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs says it voiced concerns to the United States about respecting South Korean economic activity and citizens.

DETROW: That is NPR's Camila Domonoske. Thank you so much.

DOMONOSKE: Thank you.

Conclusion: Navigating the New Normal The U.S. offshore wind sector stands at a crossroads.","The U.S. offshore wind sector, once heralded as a cornerstone of the clean energy transition, now faces a complex web of political and economic risks that are reshaping its investment landscape. While the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has provided a temporary tailwind through tax credits and funding mechanisms, policy instability—exacerbated by regulatory reversals, permitting delays, and geopolitical tensions—has introduced significant volatility into equity valuations. For investors, the interplay between these risks demands a recalibration of strategies to navigate an increasingly unpredictable environment.

Policy Instability: A Double-Edged Sword

The Trump administration’s 2023–2025 policies exemplify the sector’s vulnerability to political shifts. While streamlined permitting under NEPA reforms briefly accelerated onshore wind development, the administration’s simultaneous rollback of federal clean energy incentives—including the phase-out of the Production Tax Credit (PTC)—created a fragmented regulatory landscape [2]. This duality is evident in the fate of major offshore projects: the suspension of Empire Wind 1 and Revolution Wind in 2024, attributed to stop-work orders and permitting bottlenecks, directly eroded investor confidence [3]. According to a report by Recharge News, such regulatory uncertainty has increased project risk premiums by 15–20%, driving up capital costs and deterring private-sector participation [1].

The ripple effects of these policies are quantifiable. Norwegian energy giant Equinor, for instance, recorded a nearly $1 billion writedown on its U.S. offshore wind projects in July 2025, citing “evolving regulatory headwinds” as the primary cause [2]. Similarly, NextEra Energy’s stock price experienced sharp declines in late 2024 amid fears of potential IRA rollbacks, with analysts noting a 12% drop in valuation within a single quarter [4]. These examples underscore how policy instability can translate into tangible financial losses, even for industry leaders.

Economic Headwinds: Supply Chains and Cost Inflation

Beyond political risks, economic factors are compounding the sector’s challenges. U.S.-China trade tensions have disrupted supply chains for critical components like turbines and cables, pushing construction costs up by 30% since 2023 [3]. A 2025 Deloitte report highlights that these inflationary pressures, combined with rising interest rates, have made pure-play offshore wind developers less attractive to capital markets, with investors favoring late-stage assets offering stable cash flows [1].

The Trump administration’s 2024 tariffs on solar and battery imports further illustrate the sector’s exposure to trade policy. While these tariffs were initially framed as a boost for domestic manufacturing, industry insiders warn they could extend to wind technologies, threatening the cost competitiveness of offshore projects [1]. This dynamic is particularly acute for floating offshore wind, which relies on global supply chains and faces additional volatility from foreign exchange rate fluctuations [5].

Strategic Implications for Investors

For investors, the key takeaway is clear: policy and economic risks are now inextricably linked. The IRA’s tax credits and transferability markets have provided a floor for valuations, but their long-term efficacy hinges on political stability. A 2025 FTI Consulting analysis notes that sub-federal initiatives—such as green banks and the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund—are emerging as critical buffers against federal policy shifts, offering new monetization avenues through carbon attribute sales [1]. However, these mechanisms remain untested at scale, and their success depends on sustained state-level commitment.

Investors must also weigh the role of technological and industrial trends. The surge in demand for 24/7 clean energy from data centers and AI infrastructure could offset some policy-driven headwinds, as highlighted by the 2025 Renewable Energy Industry Outlook [1]. Yet, this demand is unlikely to materialize without regulatory clarity on permitting and grid interconnection.

Conclusion: Navigating the New Normal

The U.S. offshore wind sector stands at a crossroads. While its long-term potential remains intact, the path to realization is fraught with political and economic uncertainties. For investors, the imperative is to adopt a dual strategy: hedging against policy risks through diversified portfolios while capitalizing on emerging opportunities in state-level programs and technology-driven demand. As the 119th Congress and new administrations take shape, the ability to monitor and adapt to regulatory shifts will be the defining factor in unlocking offshore wind’s value proposition.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-06 12:07:38.727857

Through the private provider, American Independent Power, the facility will utilize solar thermal energy and liquid nitrogen to create power 24/7.
""In a thermal solar situation, we get sun heat during the day, and that heat stays through a thermal medium overnight so still solar-powered but 24/7 solar power.""
The utility company is the first in the country to pilot this project.","Lakeland's utility company will be the first in the country to pilot a liquid nitrogen generation facility.

It's another way the company is ensuring its customers will always have power flowing to their homes.

Lakeland Electric's Socrum Substation off of US 98 N will soon be the site of a small liquid nitrogen generation facility.

Sitting on half-an-acre, it'll be able to generate 5-megawatts, which provides power to about 5,000 homes.

""To put that into perspective, traditional solar would need roughly 25 acres to make the exact same power build,"" said Mike Dammer, Emerging Technology Manager at Lakeland Electric.

Through the private provider, American Independent Power, the facility will utilize solar thermal energy and liquid nitrogen to create power 24/7.

""This is different from traditional solar where the sun has to be out,"" said Dammer. ""In a thermal solar situation, we get sun heat during the day, and that heat stays through a thermal medium overnight so still solar-powered but 24/7 solar power.""

The utility company is the first in the country to pilot this project. Dammer says the neat thing about this system is its flexibility, which is why they wanted to try it out.

""This is simply a pilot, but we could take this from a one-megawatt distributed energy system at a neighborhood,"" said Dammer. ""We could make a 100-megawatt centralized system at Macintosh Power Plant, and we can do 100 things in-between.""

Big picture view:

Dammer says the goal of the project is not only to see that it works, but also to see how it works within their system.

""The goal here is we can deploy these at substations, if there's a line down between here and Mcintosh,"" said Dammer. ""We can still run power to people's houses from these systems so we want to understand how this system will inject power at a distributed level. That hasn't been done widespread across the industry yet, so we want to study that. Prudent, practical steps.""

What's next:

Power regulators to take a broad view of its powers and undertake a full review of a proposed natural gas generating station to be built in Tantramar, N.B., near the Nova Scotia border.

""It would be a very large hole in the regulatory scheme if generating facilities that N.B. Power refers to as critical are not being reviewed,"" said Ryan Burgoyne during closing arguments in front of the New Brunswick Energy and Utilities Board.

Provincial legislation requires the board to hold hearings into any N.B. Power capital project that will exceed $50 million in expenditures.

However, the utility is asking for a ruling that exempts the proposed new generating station, which will cost several hundred million dollars to construct, from that provision.

In a special arrangement with N.B. Power, the private company ProEnergy will build, own and operate the generating station, with the utility obliged to pay for the station's entire output for 25 years.

That arrangement should place the facility outside of the EUB's legal review powers, according to N.B. Power and ProEnergy.

The EUB is now sorting through arguments for and against that position.

""We're here to try to determine what a particular section in a particular piece of legislation allows us to do,"" EUB chairperson Christopher Stewart said during the hearing.

Burgoyne, who represents Saint John Energy, Edmundston Energy and the Perth Andover Electric Light Commission, said even though N.B. Power is not directly building or owning the new station, it is causing it to be built for its own use.

That, he said, gives the EUB authority to review whether it is a financially responsible project.

""I do not know how N.B. Power can credibly argue that this is not a capital project of N.B. Power. They can repeat that they do not own the project but that is not the test [for a review],"" said Burgoyne.

Also calling for a full review of the merits of the generating station were the New Brunswick Conservation Council and public intervener Alain Chiasson.

However, lawyers for both N.B. Power and ProEnergy argued New Brunswick legislation specific states that only capital projects of N.B. Power are subject to an EUB review.

""I don't see this in any way being a capital project of N.B. Power,"" said Len Hoyt, a lawyer acting for ProEnergy.

Stewart said the board recognized the importance of the issue and promised a decision ""as soon as possible.""",https://i.cbc.ca/1.7626663.1757102962!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/eub-hearing.JPG?im=Resize%3D620,N,,2025-09-06 12:06:16.632159

Americans today are rarely excited about major construction projects. This is in part because they’re associated with environmental damage, and in part because they take so long to complete.

It’s also because they’ve become so rare that people have forgotten how much they can improve lives.

Contrast this with China. Modern China has been on a building spree.

He urged the commission to reject the declaratory ruling part of the petition.
The commission has not yet acted on the other part of the petition regarding the implementation of the Social Costs of Greenhouse Gases analysis.
The commissioners discussed the petition for two minutes before voting unanimously to adopt the order PSC staff drafted rejecting the declaratory ruling request.
“The PSC makes critical decisions about utility investments in fossil fuel and clean energy infrastructure that affect all Montanans,” Harbine wrote.","The Montana Public Service Commission declined to make a declaratory ruling incorporating climate change into its regulatory oversight of the energy sector.

A coalition of 41 businesses and nonprofits submitted a petition to the PSC in March of 2024 in the wake of a state district court finding in Held v. Montana that the state’s right to a “clean and healthful environment” incorporates a right to a “stable climate system.”

The petition before the PSC had two parts. One asked the agency to adopt rulings “affirming its obligation to consider the adverse climate impacts of greenhouse gas emissions under the Montana Constitution and the statutory and regulatory framework governing its decision making.” The other included a specific rule giving the commission a framework for weighing the social, economic and environmental costs of different energy sources. That framework, developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, is called the Social Costs of Greenhouse Gases.

In his presentation before commissioners on Tuesday, PSC Chief Legal Staff Lucas Hamilton argued that the authority for declaratory rulemaking rests with the judicial and legislative branches, not with an executive-branch agency such as the Public Service Commission. He urged the commission to reject the declaratory ruling part of the petition. The commission has not yet acted on the other part of the petition regarding the implementation of the Social Costs of Greenhouse Gases analysis.

“Even if the commission had the authority under case law and the [Montana law] to issue that declaratory ruling, the draft order before you still concludes it would be inappropriate to do so here because the right to a ‘clean and healthful environment’ exists alongside several other very important rights, including the right to pursue life’s basic necessities,” Hamilton said in his breakdown of the order.

Hamilton then discussed state laws governing how the agency considers environmental impacts, public interests and the process by which utilities identify and compare new sources of electricity generation. Adding climate to the list of considerations would “engraft additional, mandatory requirements into those statutes that the Legislature did not clearly intend,” Hamilton said.

“Instead, you should consider evidence on a case-by-case basis and determine — only in the context of cases — exactly what rights are implicated by the parties appearing in front of you,” Hamilton said.

Lucas also flagged potential issues about creating a “very, very broad” framework for climate analysis that would be “binding against all present and potential future parties that may appear before the commission.”

“If the commission would like to do that, the proper method would be through administrative rulemaking,” he concluded.

The commissioners discussed the petition for two minutes before voting unanimously to adopt the order PSC staff drafted rejecting the declaratory ruling request.

Public Service Commission President Brad Molnar praised Hamilton’s work on the issue before cautioning his fellow commissioners that the PSC’s decision would likely land before a judge.

“This is one step. If anybody thinks that this isn’t going to court, I think they are wrong,” Molnar said. “Nationally, regionally and in the state of Montana, this is a conversation that will be going on for some time.”

Jenny Harbine, an attorney for Earthjustice who represented the petitioners in their request, nodded at that eventuality in an emailed statement issued Sept. 2.

“The PSC makes critical decisions about utility investments in fossil fuel and clean energy infrastructure that affect all Montanans,” Harbine wrote. “Under our constitution, the commission must account for the significant climate costs of its actions. We intend to hold them accountable to that requirement.”

Michael Hudson, a volunteer with Families for a Livable Climate, expressed disappointment with the commission’s “further delay” in acting on the petitioners’ request.

“We know that climate change will cost Montanans millions — in lost crops and livestock, in widespread health problems from increased wildfire smoke, lost tourism and more. The PSC regulates the single greatest source of CO2 emissions in our state, and it would make sense for them to consider its impacts,” Hudson said in the statement.",https://montanafreepress.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DSC_0354-1.jpeg,N,,2025-09-06 13:03:14.173932

It ...,Pamela Flick,,,,,https://davisvanguard.org/2025/09/california-ceqa-exemption-threat/,"In June, Governor Newsom worked with legislative leadership to push through SB 131 as a budget trailer bill.
But SB 131 mostly does not address housing.
These kinds of projects typically involve hazardous chemicals and solvents, yet SB 131 provides no environmental guardrails or conditions.
Further, most of the “advanced manufacturing” facilities will be built in and around disadvantaged communities that are already burdened by decades of industrial pollution.
Legislators’ commitment to fix SB 131 reflects the bill’s extreme nature.","In June, Governor Newsom worked with legislative leadership to push through SB 131 as a budget trailer bill. SB 131 was touted as a companion to AB 130, and both bills were sold as streamlining measures to the California Environmental Quality Act to rapidly accelerate housing development. While the verdict is still out on how much new housing AB 130 will actually create, it was indeed a housing bill. But SB 131 mostly does not address housing.

Instead, its most controversial feature was a CEQA exemption for a vague category of polluting industrial projects known as “advanced manufacturing.” Exempt projects include battery and energy storage manufacturing, lithium mining, defense and aerospace manufacturing, and semi-conductor and electronics manufacturing.

While innovation and new technology is important to California and our quest for clean energy, these types of projects still produce pollution that should, at least, be disclosed and evaluated when sited near communities and sensitive habitats. These kinds of projects typically involve hazardous chemicals and solvents, yet SB 131 provides no environmental guardrails or conditions. Further, most of the “advanced manufacturing” facilities will be built in and around disadvantaged communities that are already burdened by decades of industrial pollution.

Neither the public nor most legislators saw the language of SB 131, or knew about the “advanced manufacturing” exemption, until Friday, June 27, just three days before it was signed into law. At the Senate Budget Committee hearing on Monday, June 30, many senators expressed serious concerns about the likelihood of increased air and water pollution in their communities.

In response, the bill’s author (Sen. Wiener), Senate Pro Tem Mike McGuire, and other legislators committed to move clean-up legislation through the Legislature this year to address the serious concerns around the impacts of this new “advanced manufacturing” exemption.

Legislators’ commitment to fix SB 131 reflects the bill’s extreme nature. Never in 50 years has the state enacted a broad CEQA exemption for polluting industrial projects. Given California’s position of economic strength, it’s hard to understand why it is needed.

As Governor Newsom himself has been proudly touting, “California leads the nation” as the top state for Fortune 500 companies, new business starts, manufacturing, venture capital funding, high-tech businesses, and agriculture. Our state now boasts the fourth largest economy in the world.

So why are we removing common sense requirements regarding polluting industrial activities that threaten public health and the environment?

Tellingly, the state has already classified numerous metal recycling plants as “advanced manufacturing” facilities—and history shows that environmental review is essential for these projects. If such facilities are exempt from CEQA, public health in already-overburdened communities will suffer, as they’ll have no chance to understand or advocate for measures to reduce pollution.

Of equal concern is SB 131’s failure to exclude from the new exemption projects that are located on habitat for endangered and threatened species. The result could imperil sensitive species throughout California.

Because “advanced manufacturing” projects won’t require CEQA review, the public won’t be notified when a semi-conductor or aerospace manufacturing facility is built on sensitive habitat, and there will be no requirement to mitigate its impacts on species. That means that we will end up losing more habitat for declining wildlife, driving even more species to need protections. California is a world-renowned biodiversity hotspot, and our state should be doing more to avoid driving species into extinction—not giving polluting developers a pass to destroy imperiled species’ habitat.

This new framework represents a major reversal of state policy. Many legislators who felt pressured to vote for SB 131 in order to pass the state budget said this provision, too, must be fixed before the end of the legislative session. Notably, other bills that have allowed major exemptions for the environmental review process under CEQA do exclude projects located on sensitive habitat. For example, 2017’s SB 35 (Wiener) and this year’s AB 130 require projects on such habitat to undergo environmental review. Why should advanced manufacturing projects not be held to the same standard?

Time is running out to fix SB 131. Clean-up legislation must be enacted before the legislative deadline to pass bills on September 12. Nearly one-third of California’s legislators have already signed a letter calling on leadership to “expeditiously pursue legislation to address outstanding concerns on the public resources budget trailer bill, SB 131.”

California can’t afford the abundance of pollution this dangerous law will bring. Nor should we threaten more of our state’s imperiled fish and wildlife. The legislature must act quickly to fix SB 131.

Emich Volkswagen initially offered the VW ID.4, a compact crossover SUV, for $39 a month before sales tax in August.
To heighten the urgency, the Emich Volkswagen website displayed a countdown timer marking the days, hours and minutes until September 30 - the expiration date for the federal EV tax credit.
On a national scale, forecasts predict up to 38% fewer EVs on the road by 2035 without the federal tax credit.
In addition to the federal tax credit expiration, Colorado has been reducing its state EV tax credit due to revenue shortfalls.","PENNY-pinching drivers are rushing to dealerships to take advantage of EV lease deals before the federal tax credit expires later this month.

Bundling federal and state incentives has brought lease prices as low as $9 a month, which has driven a mighty surge in EV sales.

This is especially the case in Colorado, where dealerships have aggressively marketed the discounts while they last, according to CPR.

The federal tax credit, worth up to $7,500, is set to expire on September 30, prompting dealerships like Emich Volkswagen in south Denver to see packed showrooms filled with bargain-hunting motorists.

Scott Nelson, a real estate broker and customer, shared that he had wanted an EV for years but only started taking test drives after realizing these local deals wouldn’t last much longer.

“It was on our radar, but this definitely sped up the timeline,” Nelson told reporters.

After test-driving a Volkswagen ID.4 in early August, Nelson pre-ordered the vehicle to lock in the cheaper lease pricing - even if the car arrives after the deadline.

Emich Volkswagen initially offered the VW ID.4, a compact crossover SUV, for $39 a month before sales tax in August.

But starting September 1, the dealership began advertising an even cheaper $9-a-month lease on a two-wheel-drive version of the SUV.

To heighten the urgency, the Emich Volkswagen website displayed a countdown timer marking the days, hours and minutes until September 30 - the expiration date for the federal EV tax credit.

This urgency stems from federal climate policy changes, which was initially introduced under President Biden as part of efforts to combat climate change, but was later revoked under President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

The impending expiration has caused a spike in EV sales nationally - although dealers remain uncertain about how busy they will be once the incentives disappear.

On a national scale, forecasts predict up to 38% fewer EVs on the road by 2035 without the federal tax credit.

In addition to the federal tax credit expiration, Colorado has been reducing its state EV tax credit due to revenue shortfalls.

The incentive, previously $5,000, was reduced to $3,500 in 2025 and is set to decline further to $750 by 2026.

These reductions are expected to slow Colorado’s EV market, which had seen it briefly overtake California as the top state for EV adoption.

The combined loss of financial incentives from both state and federal governments, amounting to $11,700, means buyers will no longer be able to access these savings once the EV programs are reduced or taken away.

Together, these changes mean buyers will miss out on major financial savings that have made EVs more affordable.

Matthew Groves, president of the Colorado Auto Dealers Association, expressed concern that fewer discounts will make EVs more expensive, which could hurt dealerships that rely on volume sales for profitability.

Groves said: “Anything that makes cars more expensive is bad for dealers.”

Colorado dealerships have been seen as leaders in leveraging EV incentives to attract customers.

Boulder Nissan, for example, offered leases as low as $9 a month for the Nissan Leaf last summer - which resulted in record-breaking sales numbers.

Ed Olsen, sales manager at Boulder Nissan, reflected on the dealership’s success.

“It’s been such a good ride over the last year and a half or so,” he said.

Now, Olsen is working to sell or lease all EV inventory - including multiple Nissan Ariyas - before September 30.",https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/09/2024-chicago-illinois-ford-motor-914977211.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1,N,,2025-09-06 12:08:22.710163

As the energy transition accelerates, this St. Louis-based utility is not just surviving—it’s leading.","The energy transition is reshaping the utility sector, but few companies are navigating this shift as strategically—or as resiliently—as Ameren Corporation. With a $28 billion five-year capital plan announced in 2024, Ameren is doubling down on infrastructure modernization, decarbonization, and regulatory alignment, positioning itself as a linchpin in the U.S. energy landscape. At the Barclays 2025 CEO Energy-Power Conference on September 3, 2025, Ameren’s leadership underscored its commitment to balancing environmental goals with grid reliability, a rare feat in an industry where peers like FirstEnergy and Duke Energy are scaling back or abandoning their decarbonization targets [1].

Regulatory Alignment: A Foundation for Resilience

Ameren’s success hinges on its ability to align with evolving regulatory frameworks in Missouri and Illinois, two key markets it serves. In Missouri, new electric service rates effective June 2025 have bolstered revenue streams, enabling the company to fund grid upgrades and renewable projects [2]. Meanwhile, in Illinois, the Illinois Commerce Commission’s rate proposals continue to shape Ameren’s financial trajectory, with the company securing favorable terms to support its $63 billion capital investment pipeline [2]. This regulatory alignment contrasts sharply with peers like Duke Energy, which has delayed coal plant closures due to political uncertainties in “red states” [3]. By securing rate case approvals and navigating state-specific policies, Ameren ensures stable, inflation-protected returns while advancing its net-zero-by-2045 goal [4].

Decarbonization Execution: Balancing Ambition and Affordability

Ameren’s decarbonization strategy is both ambitious and pragmatic. The company is retiring less efficient coal plants while expanding low- and no-carbon generation, including solar, wind, and nuclear. Its Integrated Resource Plan emphasizes a diversified energy mix, ensuring affordability and reliability even as it phases out fossil fuels. According to a report by Ameren Missouri, the company has already made meaningful progress toward its 2030 emissions reduction targets, a stark contrast to peers like FirstEnergy, which abandoned its 30% reduction goal in 2024 to keep coal plants operational [5]. Ameren’s approach—adding 10,000 MW of renewable capacity by 2030 while maintaining fuel diversity—demonstrates its ability to execute decarbonization without compromising service quality [6].

Infrastructure Investments: Future-Proofing the Grid

Ameren’s $28 billion capital plan is not just about decarbonization; it’s about future-proofing the grid for a world dominated by electric vehicles (EVs) and distributed energy resources. The company is modernizing its infrastructure with smart grid technologies, enhancing resilience against extreme weather events and cyber threats. As highlighted in its Q2 2025 earnings call, these investments are projected to drive 6–8% compound annual earnings growth through 2029, supported by robust demand in its service territories [7]. Analysts note that Ameren’s focus on grid modernization—particularly in MISO transmission projects—positions it to capitalize on the broader shift toward decentralized, renewable-powered systems [8].

Differentiation in a Stalling Industry

While many utilities are retreating from their climate commitments, Ameren is accelerating. The company’s recent presentation at the Barclays conference emphasized its disciplined capital allocation and regulatory momentum, differentiating it from peers like American Electric Power (AEP), which has hinted at revising its “aspirational” net-zero goals [3]. Ameren’s ability to secure ratepayer support for its clean energy initiatives—coupled with its conservative yet executable capital plan—makes it a standout in an industry grappling with policy fragmentation. As one analyst put it, “Ameren is proving that decarbonization and profitability aren’t mutually exclusive” [9].

Why Investors Should Own Ameren

For investors seeking stable, inflation-protected returns, Ameren offers a compelling case. Its regulatory alignment, disciplined infrastructure spending, and proactive decarbonization strategy create a moat against both climate risks and market volatility. With a 2025 EPS guidance of $4.85–$5.05 and a projected revenue increase to $10.28 billion by 2029, the company’s financials reflect confidence in its long-term vision [2]. Moreover, Ameren’s focus on ESG metrics—particularly its hybrid renewable projects and grid resilience initiatives—aligns with the growing demand for sustainable infrastructure investments.

In a sector where many utilities are faltering, Ameren stands out as a model of resilience and execution.

Although Texas has become known for the wind farms and solar parks in the west, the state seems to be unstoppable in terms of pursuing green projects. Texas seems to have turned much of its focus towards green projects focusing on green hydrogen.

Texas is thinking larger than life in terms of its sustainable energy missions and hydrogen’s potential is being recognized. One Houston-based company is looking at constructing a 50,000 acre data center close to Laredo. This new project could very well lead to Texas being called the Data City, Texas.

Looking at bypassing the traditional grid with Data City Texas

On the cards for Texas is a data center campus of more or less 5GW that chooses to use its unique behind-the-meter power supply. By ensuring that both energy consumption and generation occurs on the same 50,000 acre property, the plan is to bypass the traditional grid completely. In the process, having energy generated, stored, and used on the same property could mean a reduction in transmission costs and in loss of energy.

However, Texas is not just looking at constructing a data center, but in creating a data center structured around sustainable and uninterupted power. The need for uniterupted power is more necessary due to the increase in artificial learning as well as machine learning.

Energy Abundance which has changed its name from Green Hydrogen International has faith in its management team who are known to have much experience in terms of behind-the-meter project engineering. The idea is for this data center to be one of the largest that is powered by a constant supply of green energy.

What the emergence of Data City could mean for Texas?

The ground-breaking project finally had its big reveal and it his clear that the Houston-based Energy Abundance Development Corporation will be behind Data City, Texas. Data City will be designed in such a way that it operates with about 5 gigawatts (GW) of power capacity. The Data City will also be developed in phases with the first phase of the 300MW facility said to come about in 2026.

Where the idea of Data City can be said to be revolutional is in terms of how operations will be powered. Initially and during the first few phases, the reliance will be on solar and wind power as well as on natural gas. Thereafter, the idea is to ensure that all operations are entirely powered by hydrogen. Hydrogen City, a green hydrogen and ammonia production site close by, will ensure solar and wind power is utilized to produce about 280,000 tons of green hydrogen every year. The question remains is green hydrogen still the future?

Data City powering the AI revolution in the process

After the initial phase in 2026, Data City is believed to be expanding to 5 gigawatts of power over 15 million square feet of space. According to Brian Maxwell, CEO and founder of Energy Abundance, America will be in the lead in the AI race having the ability to showcase green power generation that is constant. With Elon Musk also looking to dry up Texas for what has been underground for millions of years, Texas surely is becoming the hub of economic growth and futuristic innovation.

Revolution Wind is projected to save Connecticut and Rhode Island ratepayers hundreds of millions of dollars over 20 years. The Revolution Wind project supports over 2,500 jobs nationwide in the construction, operations, shipbuilding and manufacturing sectors, including over 1,000 union construction jobs. The project has been vetted and approved through every layer of the federal and state regulatory process and is supported by binding contracts and legal mandates. Construction is nearly complete.

The August 22 stop work order issued by the Bureau of Ocean and Energy Management (BOEM) did not identify any violation of law or imminent threat to safety. The order abstractly cites BOEM's authority under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA), ordering the stop so that the agency may address unidentified “concerns.” No explanation was provided.

The complaint, to be filed against the Department of the Interior, BOEM and their appointed leaders alleges that such arbitrary government conduct violates both the Administrative Procedure Act and the government's authority under OCSLA.

Both laws “demand reasoned decision-making, fidelity to statutory limits, and respect for the settled expectations of sovereign States and regulated parties,” the complaint states. ""The States of Connecticut and Rhode Island sue to vindicate those principles. They seek to restore the rule of law, protect their energy and economic interests, and ensure that the federal government honors its commitments.""

The complaint asks that the court declare the stop work order unlawful and block the Trump administration from halting Revolution Wind's development.

""Revolution Wind is fully permitted, nearly complete and months from providing enough American-made, clean, affordable energy to power 350,000 homes. Now, with zero justification, Trump wants to mothball the project, send workers home, and saddle Connecticut families with millions of dollars in higher energy costs. This kind of erratic and reckless governing is blatantly illegal, and we're suing to stop it,"" said Attorney General Tong.

“With Revolution Wind, we have an opportunity to create good-paying jobs for Rhode Islanders, enhance energy reliability, and ensure energy cost savings while protecting our environment,” said Attorney General Neronha.

""It's been nearly two weeks, and the Trump Administration still has not explained or justified its decision to halt construction of Revolution Wind. While this is unacceptable, there is still a path forward if Washington is willing to be a partner. We hoped to work with the Administration to lower energy costs, strengthen grid reliability, create jobs, and drive economic growth, but only if they share those goals. But if they do not, we will act to preserve this vital project and protect the energy future of Connecticut and the entire New England region,"" said Governor Ned Lamont.

""Shutting down Revolution Wind is insane, illogical, and illegal. Thousands of workers are without jobs, businesses may close, and energy prices will only climb higher because of this foolish decision.

James Stewart is president of Unifor Local 444, representing workers at the Nextstar EV battery Plant and the Stellantis Windsor Assembly Plant. Workers in Windsor make the Chrysler Pacifica hybrid as well as the Dodge Charger Daytona.

""I understand why he's doing it, [Carney] is trying to find some relief for the industry in the short term,"" Stewart said.

I would caution in the long term, we need to make sure Canada is developing EV technology and EVs.

""Long term, we are falling behind countries like China. They're finding ways to develop their technology around EVs and, and due to that fact, lowering the cost around EVs and Canada has to make sure we're doing that. You're going to see EVs becoming part of the industry and if we fall too far behind, we're not going to be able to make the ground up.""

Carney announced the government would pause the EV mandate, which has prescribed targets for how much of an automakers' sales needs to be from EVs, for the 2026 model year and review the policy for 60 days. The 2026 target would have been 20 per cent of total sales.

The overall mandate is 100 per cent EV sales in Canada by 2035.

But automakers have lobbied against the mandate, arguing they have been hit too hard by tariffs and it would put jobs at risk.

It comes with an announcement of a whole host of other measures meant to help workers and industries hit by tariffs.

""It's not all about money, some of it is about regulation. So to add flexibility to the automotive sector, we will remove the 2026 Electric Vehicle Availability Standard, which specifies the share of new vehicle sales that must be electric next year,"" Carney said.

""This will provide immediate financial relief to automakers at a time of increased pressure on their competitiveness.""

WATCH | The Windsor Assembly Plant could be in trouble if tariffs don't disappear: Auto expert

Stewart says that EVs are here to stay, and Canada needs to be cautious about letting other countries run up a lead.

In Windsor, Stewart said his workers are well-positioned: Windsor Assembly is a multi-platform plant that builds EVs hybrids and gas engines.

""The Windsor Assembly Plant will be able to adapt to more EVs, less EVs, more top hats — whether it's a car, truck or van,"" he said. ""The plant will adjust based on the market.""

His union also represents workers at the NextStar EV battery plant. There, too, he says the company is diversifying and he's ""confident"" the facility can handle the change.

As for the other measures Carney announced, Stewart says he's cautiously optimistic but has many questions about how the supports will apply to autoworkers.

Both NextStar Energy or Stellantis declined to comment to CBC.

Flavio Volpe, president of the Automotive Parts Manufacturers' Association (APMA), says automakers are applauding the move.

""Football fans know the value in a well timed and well placed punt,"" Volpe said. ""That's what this is right now.

""The pressure that this [mandate] would have put on manufacturers who have had their major market cut off in a hostile manner by the White House, looking at if this kept going up to a $3 billion in additional costs next year. I'm glad that they've removed the 2026 standard.""

He said the government remains committed to electrification, and he hopes they use this pause to speak to and listen to employers in the automotive industry.

""It's a challenge from the government to say, 'look, we're going to pause, we're going to stick to the EV tariffs that we have on China that are controversial in some spaces, but we're going to give you all the tools for you to reconfigure and build for Canada.'""",https://i.cbc.ca/1.7506150.1744229744!/cantoImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/wap-tariff-last-shift.jpg?im=Resize%3D620,N,,2025-09-06 12:07:18.003554

“Utilities are committing to large loads ramping rapidly this decade,” Ben Hertz-Shargel, global head of grid edge for Wood Mackenzie, said in a statement.
Data centers could consume 9% of the United States’ electricity generation by 2030 — double the amount consumed today, according to the Electric Power Research Institute.
But experts agree that not all of the proposed data centers will be built.
Investor-owned utilities have over 17 GW of large loads under construction and have committed to another 99 GW, together equal to 15.5% of current US peak demand, WoodMac said in the report.","Large loads, including AI data centers, are showing up on the U.S. electric grid and could ultimately add 20% to utilities’ peak demand, most within the next decade, according to new analysis from Wood Mackenzie published Thursday.

The report looks at investor-owned utilities’ near-term committed loads and more speculative projects beyond 2035, as well as shifts in where the demand is showing up and uncertainty around the buildout.

“Utilities are committing to large loads ramping rapidly this decade,” Ben Hertz-Shargel, global head of grid edge for Wood Mackenzie, said in a statement. “The market will be hard-pressed to supply this new load on that timeframe, which may prevent it from happening.”

The need for electricity in the United States is growing rapidly, following years of flat-line demand. The growth is being driven by data centers, industrial expansion and electrification, but just how much power demand will show up remains uncertain.

Data centers could consume 9% of the United States’ electricity generation by 2030 — double the amount consumed today, according to the Electric Power Research Institute. But experts agree that not all of the proposed data centers will be built.

Investor-owned utilities have over 17 GW of large loads under construction and have committed to another 99 GW, together equal to 15.5% of current US peak demand, WoodMac said in the report. Another 32 GW of capacity “is in advanced conversation or a near-term forecast, resulting in 147 GW of high-probability load, equal to 20% of US peak demand.”

A significant portion of this capacity will come online this decade, WoodMac said, with 60 GW expected to be added through 2030 — or about 8% of current U.S. peak demand. Utilities expect 93 GW to be operational by 2035, “after which little pipeline capacity has been disclosed,” the firm said.

But how much of the longer-lead load is high-confidence capacity in utility forecasts?

“Rather than starting to see a trend toward pipeline certainty, we continue to observe the opposite,” Hertz-Shargel said.

WoodMac said its analysis shows “modest increases” in high-confidence capacity at several utilities, but the high-confidence share of the total capacity pipeline “has decreased over the last few quarters as new requests outpace the advancement and withdrawal of existing requests.”

There has also been a shift towards large load development in deregulated markets, the report found.

“While 91% of the current 17 GW of disclosed capacity under construction is located in regulated markets, 54% of committed capacity not yet under construction and 65% of capacity in advanced discussion is planned for deregulated markets,” WoodMac said.

“Committed capacity not under construction as well as advanced discussion capacity fall disproportionately in deregulated markets,” primarily in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas area, said Hertz-Shargel. “Deregulated markets pose risks of inadequate future supply and price increases to non-large load customers, which has prompted market interventions by Texas and PJM and will likely prompt more in the future.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/hIdsAudTEAQ30lovdVYmOOsNwxVlhWu7zfHQLuo6vbY/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMzQwNTY3MTQ4LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-09-06 12:06:20.754080

This week Prime Minister Mark Carney unveiled a series of actionable priorities to support sectors of Canada’s economy struggling in the face of U.S. tariffs — including the automotive industry.

Among the long list of issues addressed was the government’s role in encouraging the adoption of electric vehicles and, specifically, a promise that Canadian automakers and dealerships will not be forced to meet the 2026 Electric Vehicle Availability Standard (EVAS).

“We have an auto sector which, because of the massive change in U.S. policy, is under extreme pressure. We recognize that,” said the prime minister, who confirmed he is beginning an immediate 60-day review of the EVAS.

“They’ve got enough on their plate right now, so we’re taking that off.”

The EVAS regulations (originally set by the previous incarnation of the liberal government) state that for 2026, at least 20 per cent of new light-duty vehicle sales in Canada be zero emissions vehicles. Those percentages were slated to rise to 60 per cent by 2030 before finally reaching 100 per cent of all new light-duty vehicle sales by 2035.

According to a government statement, the purpose of the review is to ensure the EVAS framework “continues to reflect market realities, remains effective for Canadians, and does not place undue burden on automakers. The review will consider potential amendments to the annual sales targets, including the 2035 goal, and will explore possible additional flexibilities.”

Industry response

Responses to the announced EV policy change were quick to come and range from fully supportive to disappointed.

Ontario mayors representing cities where automotive manufacturing occurs, dubbed “Auto Mayors,” expressed strong support for government’s revised approach to EVs.

“The decision to waive the 2026 model year vehicles from the Electric Vehicle Availability Standard, combined with an immediate 60-day review of the EV Standard is the essential course correction needed to prevent the loss of the Canadian auto industry,” the Auto Mayors wrote in a statement.

The Canadian Automotive Dealer’s Association also came out in favour of the plans and said it would engage with the federal government during the 60-day review period.

“It gives certainty to consumers and the automotive industry for the next year, and will help to avoid a consumer availability and affordability crisis in the short term. The provinces of Quebec and British Columbia should immediately follow this lead to avoid perpetuating internal trade barriers,” the association wrote in a statement.

Meanwhile the Canadian Charging Infrastructure Council (CCIC), which represents the businesses that manage half of the public charging sites in Canada, issued a statement emphasizing the importance of maintaining the EVAS.

CCIC’s president, Travis Allan, wrote, “The EVAS plays a critical role in supporting the multi-year investments in charging infrastructure and utility upgrades needed by future Canadian EV drivers. These investments create sustainable, well-paying jobs in civil and electrical trades across Canada.”

The council urged the federal government to “keep [EVAS] targets ambitious and to provide long-term policy certainty that attracts private investment.”

National industry association, Electric Mobility Canada (EMC), says the way EVAS is currently structured offers sufficient flexibility to accommodate for changed U.S. trade policy and what is needed now is government to throw its support behind EV adoption.

“While Canada is providing the industry temporary relief from regulatory compliance, Electric Mobility Canada urges the government to swiftly confirm a clear path forward,” reads a statement from EMC president and CEO, Daniel Breton.

“The EV Availability Standard remains essential for ensuring predictability and supporting investments across the broader EV ecosystem.”

The Pembina Institute also weighed in on the changes to EV policy. The director of its transportation program, Adam Thorn, shared his thoughts in a statement.

“The federal government’s decision to pause — rather than adjust — the EV Availability Standard leans too heavily toward the concerns of the automotive industry, not the best interest of Canadians. It also unfairly penalizes companies that have already made investments in EV production and infrastructure based on an expectation of clear, consistent policy.”

Thorn suggests that the government look at other options including: “extending credits for plug-in hybrid vehicle and charging infrastructure, modestly adjusting targets, or re-evaluating tariffs on Chinese-made EVs.”

Next steps

The government’s 60 day review period of EVAS will no doubt include hearing feedback from industry stakeholders as they lobby the government in the hopes of informing the path forward.

“We are using this as an opportunity, as part of a broader strategy on climate competitiveness, to look at all our measures to help get greenhouse gases down in the key sectors,” said Carney.

“We’ll look at the interaction between the EV mandate, our clean fuel standards, our investment tax credits, our trade policy — all of those elements. What this government is focussed on is absolutely results.”

What exactly those “results” are is still unclear, but Carney did pledge that as part of the review, “we’ll advance new options to bring more — and more affordable — electric vehicles to Canadians.”",https://cms.electricautonomy.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Canada-EV-mandate-hero.jpeg,N,,2025-09-06 07:59:37.364386

CHESTER, Pa.—In this small city south of Philadelphia, trash is a problem. A thick white cloud rising from Reworld’s Delaware Valley Resource Recovery Facility, the largest trash incinerator in the country by capacity, and the stinging odor of garbage are daily reminders that mounds of waste from Philadelphia, New York City and Delaware are a toxic burden here.

Air pollution from the burning trash and emissions from other industrial sites along the river have long been blamed for contributing to high rates of deadly illnesses in Chester and the surrounding Delaware County. Beginning in 1996, the Environmental Protection Agency noted the harmful load of industrial facilities in the city.

Now, researchers and community groups are raising alarms that Chester and its neighboring towns could face a new liquified natural gas (LNG) terminal that will increase emissions and pollution and add a potential threat of explosions.

Their concern comes amid a push by the Trump administration to dramatically increase LNG exports, which could contribute an estimated $1.3 trillion dollars to the U.S. gross domestic product through 2040. Pennsylvania lawmakers speak of the financial benefits of a terminal along the Delaware River—they predict thousands of new jobs—but people who live in the region are most interested and worried about the quality of the air they breathe.

LNG is a form of natural gas cooled to minus 260 degrees Fahrenheit. In Pennsylvania, the nation’s second largest energy-producing state, the gas comes primarily from fracking the Marcellus Shale, which runs beneath about two-thirds to three-quarters of the state.

The condensed fuel is shipped to international markets, which has bolstered the national economy in recent years. But a recent Inside Climate News analysis has found that those exports, and specifically the tankers that transport LNG from the United States, contribute to global warming through the emission of methane, a climate super-pollutant 80 times more warming than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period.

For the community activists facing a new LNG export terminal, the risks of the tanker traffic and possible pipeline accidents far outweigh the benefits. “It’s the potential of death,” said David Kronheim. The retired computer programmer has lived in Chester for five years, about a mile from the incinerator. If an LNG export terminal were built nearby, Kronheim said he would want to move. “It doesn’t matter where they build it. If you’re within 10 miles you’re in trouble,” said Kronheim, who has joined a local activist group that is fighting the terminal.

In 2016, a New York based company, Penn America Energy, wrote a report on the economic impact of building a $6.4 billion dollar facility that would operate out of Chester in 2023. CEO Franc James held meetings with local lawmakers but faced local pressure against allowing another polluting industry into an overburdened community and obstacles from the Biden administration to slow LNG exports.

That changed on Jan. 20 as President Trump signed an executive order declaring a national energy emergency. LNG exports have become a focus of foreign policy and energy development.

In April, Pennsylvania Republican Sen. David McCormick announced in a Washington Times op-ed that Penn America was collaborating with the Pennsylvania Building Trades, a union alliance, on a $7 billion LNG export terminal in Eddystone Borough, a working class white community next to Chester along the I-95 corridor south of Philadelphia.

That terminal, he said, would contribute to future “energy domination” and “that future runs through Pennsylvania.”

“This massive, proposed project in southeastern Pennsylvania has the potential to generate billions in economic impact over the next 20 years, create 3,000 good-paying jobs, and produce $30-$40 million per year in tax revenue for this community,” McCormick said in a separate statement on his Senate website that criticized Biden’s efforts to evaluate environmental and economic impacts of LNG exports.

“The Biden Administration foolishly placed an indefinite pause on this and other critical projects, halting our progress towards energy independence…I’m grateful to President Trump for immediately reversing this ban, allowing proposals like this new LNG export terminal to resume and unleashing Pennsylvania’s energy dominance,” McCormick said.

In June, Reuters reported that James, the Penn America Energy executive, had a meeting in the White House to “provide intelligence” on bringing LNG operations to southeast Pennsylvania. James told Reuters he was looking beyond the original Chester location to other possible sites in Trainer, Marcus Hook and Eddystone.

Last month, Trump signed a record agreement with the European Union to buy $750 billion dollars worth of American energy in the next three years—an amount that some experts warn is unrealistic.

Activists in Delaware County have said that McCormick’s optimistic estimates for job creation and tax revenues clash with on-the-ground realities: potential public health harm from what could be a 100-acre site in a residential area.

Chester and Eddystone are part of what advocates have identified as an environmental justice area, where low-income neighborhoods and communities of color have been disproportionately harmed by polluting industries for decades.

Zulene Mayfield, an activist who heads the nonprofit Chester Residents Concerned for Quality Living (CRCQL), has been at the forefront of the environmental justice movement in Chester since 1992.

When she hears talk of a potential economic boom in the area, Mayfield said she can’t help but take the word literally, thinking of a 2022 explosion at an LNG site in Freeport, Texas, that stemmed from a pipe failure. Vapors ignited a fireball. Damage was contained to the site, and there were no injuries reported to authorities, according to a government website.

She noted that the potential exists for liquified natural gas to combust and CRCQL is concerned about an explosion risk in Delaware County, a densely populated area. Two local hospitals closed in the past year, and Mayfield said that undercut the community’s ability to handle medical crises.

“The difference now is that they’ve ripped away the protections,” she said referring to EPA regulations. “And there have never been that many in the first place.”

Following Trump’s executive order, the U.S. Department of Energy announced in January that it was lifting Biden’s 2024 pause on LNG exports. In March, the EPA announced 31 regulatory rollbacks that it called ”the biggest deregulatory action in U.S. history” to encourage energy production.

“We know there’s no help from the EPA,” Mayfield said. “Don’t think the cavalry is coming from Washington. It is incumbent on us to become our own cavalry.”

The Delaware Riverkeeper Network, a nonprofit that aims to protect waterways, has submitted right-to-know requests to Eddystone Borough to sort through documentation or filings related to efforts to build the export terminal. Following Sen. McCormick’s op-ed that raised Eddystone as a possible site, the borough manager for code compliance in May emailed a response to the Riverkeepers that said: “There is nothing to report as I do not know what you are referring to.”

Tracy Carluccio, deputy director of the Delaware Riverkeeper Network, said she is concerned that Penn America Energy has been informally lining up support with elected representatives from the state.

Eddystone and Chester are communities directly next to each other on the Delaware River. Chester takes up six square miles, Eddystone accounts for less than two square miles. Activists say that neither are large enough to safely accommodate the industry, and there isn’t a site to build in either location that wouldn’t infringe on homes, small businesses, churches, or major throughways.

“They would have to go in and destroy the community,” Mayfield said, referring to Eddystone. “[An LNG terminal] is way too large for a populated area like this.”

Mayfield said she is just as worried about LNG in Eddystone as she was about Chester.

Comparing the situation to a house on fire,she said that the threat was the same, regardless of which town in Delaware County that investors had their sights on. “If they go to Eddystone, that’s the equivalent of a neighbor’s house on fire,” she said. “If their house is on fire, our house is going to burn, too.”

Turning their efforts to resisting plans for LNG in Eddystone, Mayfield and Carluccio are leading an education and mobilization campaign across Delaware County with public and virtual forums. Researchers from Haverford College have joined to explain how the LNG terminal would affect the county, beyond economic terms.

“They want us dumb,” said Mayfield at a public forum that CRCQL sponsored last month. “They don’t want educated thinkers. They want workers—bargain basement thinkers who won’t challenge them.”

A crowd of about 30 residents, community organizers and researchers sat on wooden pews one hot summer day at the Quaker Providence Friends Meeting House in Media, about six miles north of Chester, to learn how LNG’s promise for economic development could affect their health.

Mayfield and Carluccio said residents in the affluent area near Chester should care about the LNG terminal. “The fight is getting those who don’t see and smell it [to understand] that you are in just as much danger,” Mayfield said.

Residents living in towns not directly burdened by the industries that pollute Chester might not be aware of the dangerous air emissions that waft inland from the waterfront, she said.

Chester, a predominantly Black community, is burdened by a disproportionate amount of polluting industries, which fits a larger trend of systemic racial bias, along with lower socioeconomic status, as a defining factor of where these industries are historically located. A General Accounting Office study in the 1980s found 75 percent of hazardous waste sites across eight states were in low-income communities of color.

Mayfield pointed out that what happens in Chester now will affect nearby communities. Majority white suburbs will be affected by the LNG terminal’s traffic and air pollution, she said. Harm won’t be contained to just one zip code.

Lauren Minsky, a health studies professor at Haverford College who spoke during the meeting, said her research on cancer in Delaware County found industries on the river had contributed to pollution that correlates with a range of heightened rates of deadly diseases in southeast Pennsylvania.

Minsky presented a map during the meeting that tracked weather patterns and showed how wind moves northwest and inland from the waterfront. Towns farther from the river, including Media, would be affected, and the air from the waterfront was shown to be laden with particulate matter and carcinogens, she said.

“You can think of [it] as a sacrifice zone where people are losing their lives because of these facilities,” Minsky said. ““People in these communities are dying young.”

“It’s not always routine, it’s not only where you work, it’s not only your lifestyle, it can be the land and the air where you live that affects you,” Mayfield said about the causes of cancer and asthma in Delaware County. “Our children literally cannot breathe.”

Children in Eddystone developed Hodgkin’s Lymphoma, a blood cancer, at a rate 1,051 percent higher than the national average, according to Minsky’s research. Meanwhile in Chester City, female rates of laryngeal cancer were 201 percent higher than the national average, and male rates of liver and bile cancer were 97 percent higher than the national average, her research found.

A study published in May by Johns Hopkins researchers focused on Chester and surrounding boroughs in an effort to better account for and assess the noncarcinogenic health eﬀects of cumulative chemical exposures. The researchers found that the mix of pollutants from the various industries posed more health risks to nearby communities–called “fenceline communities” in the study–than the harm associated with a single pollutant.

The Johns Hopkins team noted that “communities along the Delaware River in southeastern Pennsylvania have long faced high levels of pollution from petro-chemical reﬁneries, municipal waste incinerators, and several other industrial facilities.” The EPA had for years documented elevated rates of infant mortality, cancer mortality, and asthma among residents.

Other groups that attended Mayfield’s meeting included Swarthmore College’s Campus Coalition Concerning Chester, Earth Quaker Action Team, and Choices, a youth environmental justice group affiliated with CRCQL.

While CRCQL has been spreading the word of environmental justice and rallying support against LNG proposals this summer through public meetings, Choices has been doing its own advocacy. Its members are between 8 and 18 years old.

Their work has included testing soil samples for lead with University of Pennsylvania researchers, volunteering at a local farm, building solar panels, and events to support and inspire the community.

Nolan Fontaine, who has an Ed.D. in sociology, equity studies and education, is an American Indian organizer who also leads Choices. Modern day Chester is located in the Okehocking and Lenapehocken region, and Fontaine’s activism includes reclaiming his familial roots along the Delaware River. He said Choices aims to change the narrative about industries that came to the city promising jobs and left residents fighting for air.

Hope and love for the community, he said, is intertwined with the resistance to the trash incinerator and polluting sites along the river. It’s evident in Choices initiatives including, “Sowing Seeds of Hope,” a gardening event and plant giveaway.

“It’s a small act of resistance. While we aren’t able to shut down Reworld Covanta yet,” Fontaine said of Chester’s trash incinerator, “we can control our homes and our small environments to make them cleaner, fresher, and a safe place for us to be able to breathe.”",https://delawarecurrents.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/chester-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 12:06:29.869149

As one of his first acts as Prime Minister, Carney ended the consumer carbon price — and Van Nijnatten places Carney’s pausing of the EV sales mandate on the same throughline.
With Chinese and European carmakers surging forward with EVs, Van Nijnatten fears pausing the mandate will only add to the gap in North American competitiveness while limiting choice for consumers.
Canada’s auto sector is highly integrated with the US and is facing significant impacts from US President Donald Trump’s tariffs.
“I just spent three months looking at hybrids and EVs,” Van Nijnatten said.","“The Liberals keep retreating in the face of populist conservative rhetoric that targets some aspects of climate policy,” Van Nijnatten said.

As one of his first acts as Prime Minister, Carney ended the consumer carbon price — and Van Nijnatten places Carney’s pausing of the EV sales mandate on the same throughline.

“All this does is make me think … he's going to lift the oil and gas [emissions] cap as well,” she said.

Bloc Québécois environment and climate change critic Patrick Bonin slammed Carney’s decision in an emailed statement.

""By once again bowing to pressure from the lobby of Ontario automakers and western oil companies, the federal government is weakening our environment and the availability of electric vehicles, all at the expense of Quebecers,” Bonin said in the statement, released in French.

“Once again, we see that when it comes to fighting climate change, Mark Carney has only one gear: backward.""

Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, who has been calling for the mandate to be scrapped, called the delay a “clumsy retreat” that adds uncertainty for investors in the auto sector. The NDP did not respond to a request for comment.

The transportation sector is responsible for 23 per cent of Canada’s emissions, second only to the oil and gas sector’s 30 per cent share. From 1990 to 2023, emissions from cars have fallen while emissions from light trucks (including SUVs) more than doubled.

Oil and gas and transportation are the highest emitting economic sectors and should be responsible for a fair share of emissions reductions but pausing the sales mandate gives the transport sector a break, Van Nijnatten said. The electricity sector is doing some heavy lifting to reduce emissions and emissions from the heavy industry sector are also falling.

With Chinese and European carmakers surging forward with EVs, Van Nijnatten fears pausing the mandate will only add to the gap in North American competitiveness while limiting choice for consumers.

North American automakers “will not choose to do it on their own, because, first of all, they're protected by tariff walls and, second of all, they're protected by policy and politics,” she said.

Keith Brooks, programs director at Environmental Defence, said “healthy competition” is needed to balance supporting Canada’s auto sector while offering consumers choices and reducing planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.

“If we bring Chinese EVs in, and we create a more competitive market, that's good, because the domestic automakers here in North America would just rather not do EVs,” Brooks said in an Aug. 14 phone interview with Canada’s National Observer.

“If they're not being pushed to [build EVs], either by regulation or competition, we're not going to get them.”

Removing the first sales target is a “direct disincentive” for automakers to make electric vehicles available to Canadians, Van Nijnatten said.

The auto sector holds considerable power — particularly in Ontario — and many auto sector groups and companies have long opposed the federal government’s regulations, which require hybrids and EVs to make up “at least” 20 per cent of sales in 2026 and 100 per cent by 2035. Canada’s auto sector is highly integrated with the US and is facing significant impacts from US President Donald Trump’s tariffs. A common refrain from companies and industry associations is that the sales targets are unrealistic.

The regulations operate with a credit system for flexibility so companies that perform better than their ZEV targets earn credits which they can bank or sell to other companies who are underperforming. ZEV sales from 2024 and 2025 also count towards the credits, offering further flexibility, Daniel Breton, head of Electric Mobility Canada, said in a phone interview with Canada’s National Observer on Aug. 14.

Companies — and Conservative politicians such as Pierre Poilievre — also say the sales mandate will limit consumer choice.

Van Nijnatten said, as a consumer, her choices are already being restricted and removing the sales target will only exacerbate the problem.

“I just spent three months looking at hybrids and EVs,” Van Nijnatten said. “Do you think I can buy one off a lot anywhere?” Her answer: no.

Risk to profits

The Detroit Three auto manufacturers (Ford, GM and Stellantis) met with Carney in June and called on him to scrap the EV mandate.

In corporate filings, the auto manufacturers say that the transition to electric vehicles poses risks to the companies’ profits.

“Ford’s results are dependent on sales of larger, more profitable vehicles, particularly in the United States,” the company disclosed to shareholders. “A shift in consumer preferences away from larger, more profitable vehicles with internal combustion engines (including trucks and utilities) to electric or other vehicles in our portfolio that may be less profitable could result in an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.”

Some stakeholders are more optimistic about the 60-day review. It is an opportunity for the federal government to marry EV sector policy with its made-in-Canada industrial development goals, Matthew Fortier, president and CEO of Accelerate, said in an emailed statement to Canada’s National Observer.

“We want more Canadians driving EVs but we also want more Canada in those EVs, including critical minerals, batteries and other components,” Fortier said. “I think there are ways to use policies designed to drive purchase uptake to also incentivize manufacturer investment into our supply chain.”

In Mississauga, Carney said his government “will advance new options to bring more affordable electric vehicles to Canadians” but did not say how. Last fall, the federal government imposed a 100 per cent tariff on cheaper, Chinese-made EVs, which prompted China to impose retaliatory tariffs on Canadian canola imports. Lifting that tariff would increase the availability and affordability of EVs.

In a press conference last week, Housing Minister Gregor Robertson (speaking for Energy Minister Tim Hodgson) said Canada will not be dropping its tariff on Chinese EVs in order to protect workers at Canadian automakers.

When asked on Friday if the federal government will consider lifting the tariff on China’s EVs, Carney said, “We have begun more intense engagement with China with respect, first and foremost, to canola and other agriculture and seafood products … I'm sure those discussions will branch out, but it's too early to come to any conclusions on those.”

The government also intends to strengthen federal tax credits to “foster investment in clean energy” and keep the industrial carbon price but noted a need to “improve” the way the carbon market works, Carney said Friday, speaking in French. There will be a policy for “carbon competitiveness” and nature, he said.

“We intend to do a lot but we're focusing really on results, and the results are to improve the competitiveness of our economy, our businesses, as it pertains to the reduction in greenhouse gasses.”

Van Nijnatten said maybe Carney will “pull a rabbit out a hat” with his forthcoming climate strategy, but these initiatives don’t show much promise.

“Anything you do that dances around direct emission reductions delays the transition,” she said. “It will make it more costly in the long run. It places industries at a competitive disadvantage over the long run and … it's not going to contribute to our 2030 emissions reduction plan.”

At Tesla, Armstrong led a team of 1,800 employees manufacturing powertrain products for the Model X and Model S, and she brings her experience in scaling high-volume, cost-effective manufacturing in the United States to Inlyte. Armstrong also served as the VP of Manufacturing and Programs at Zero Motorcycles, where she doubled the company's manufacturing footprint in California to grow battery and motor production. ""In my experience, high-volume manufacturing is one of the hardest transitions for startups,"" said Armstrong. ""I'm excited to bring my experience scaling domestic manufacturing to deliver resilient, affordable energy storage to our customers.""

Goswami co-founded Molekule and led the company as the CEO, President, and CTO to $100M+ in revenue, $100M+ in successive fundraises and a public listing through a merger with AeroClean Technologies. Goswami's decision to join the leadership team follows his term as a Venture Partner at At One Ventures, where he led the firm's initial investment in Inlyte Energy. Goswami will lead Inlyte's finance and strategy to position the company for its next phase of growth. ""Inlyte has a unique position of innovative but proven technology, unbeatable cost, and surging customer interest,"" said Goswami. ""Now it's time to execute on our vision for large scale, safe, cost-effective energy storage.""

These hires come as Inlyte has announced its first utility-scale BESS project with Southern Company and a Department of Energy-backed commercial-scale project in a fire-risk zone in Northern California this year. The team will be attending the RE+ Conference in Las Vegas, NV next week to build commercial partnerships for Inlyte's first US factory.

Source: DOT, IRS EV STATS IN HAWAII >> Hawaii has 38,086 registered passengers EVs.","For electric vehicle drivers in Hawaii, there will soon be few, if any, perks left — as some of the most popular ones are set to expire this month.

Solo drivers with EV license plates have since 2012 been permitted to use the high-occupancy vehicle lane on Oahu highways, which are usually reserved for cars with at least two occupants during rush hour to encourage carpooling.

On Sept. 30, a federal code allowing states to set their own HOV lane requirements expires, and federal tax credits of up to $7,500 for the purchase or lease of EV vehicles also end.

These changes come at a time when Hawaii is being held accountable for its ambitious, state-mandated goals of achieving 100% clean energy and net-zero emissions by 2045, and are expected to hamper efforts to get more residents to drive electric in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

“It definitely doesn’t help,” said state Rep. Nicole Lowen, chair of the House Energy and Environmental Protection Committee. “Taking incentives away isn’t pushing things in the right direction.”

Still, she thinks most of the impetus behind EV adoption has been market­ driven.

The HOV lane perk may have been an incentive for some drivers commuting on the H-1 freeway to go electric, but even without it, EVs remain a competitive choice for consumers, she said, because they cost less to own and operate in the long run.

There are fewer maintenance costs, such as a regular oil changes, and no more waiting in line at the gas station.

“From a consumer point of view, there’s still a really strong case for it,” she said. “I think we’ll continue to see people buying EVs.”

History of perks

In an effort to boost the adoption of EVs, Hawaii passed a law in 2012 that offered a smorgasbord of perks.

EVs were not only allowed to use the HOV lane with only one occupant, but granted free parking at street parking meters, in state and county parking lots, and at airport parking lots.

Those privileges sunsetted on July 1, 2020, but the state Department of Transportation extended the HOV perk for EV drivers.

DOT says it is complying with federal law come Sept. 30, but will retain language written into Hawaii’s administration rules should states be able to make their own rules once again.

Additionally, car consumers will no longer be eligible for a $7,500 in federal tax credits for the purchase of new EVs as a result of President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” adopted in July. Hawaii does not offer tax credits or rebates for the purchase of EVs.

The Electric Vehicle Association called the rollback of incentives a step in the wrong direction and “a lane change we can’t afford to make.”

EVA board member Elaine Borseth called the HOV lane perk “one of the simplest, most effective ways to encourage clean transportation,” and said it’s still necessary, given that EV adoption is still in a critical growth phase.

“We’re on our way, but we’re not there yet,” she said in a recent blog post. “Removing low-cost, high-impact incentives like HOV access risks slowing the momentum just when we need it most.”

EVs on the rise

Noel Morin, president of the Hawaii EV Association, said it is unfortunate to see these barriers to adoption, especially as sales are gaining momentum in the state.

The perks and tax incentives appear to have spurred the growth of EVs in Hawaii, with year-over-year increases over the past five years.

In July 2021 there were 15,551 registered EVs in Hawaii, which more than doubled to nearly 33,000 by July 2024. As of July this year, the state counted 38,086 registered EVs in Hawaii, a 16% increase from 2024.

EVs now represent 3.5% of the more than 1 million registered passenger vehicles in the state.

“If you look at the trajectory, more people are adopting EVs,” Morin said. “As people upgrade, and rental car companies dispense of EVs, it also means you have a pre-owned market.”

The range of EV batteries has improved, and there are an expanding number of EV options to choose from in the U.S., including ones that start at lower price points from brands such as Nissan, Chevrolet and Hyundai.

Locally, the expanding pre-owned EV market also offers consumers more affordable EV choices.

The addition of tariffs and Matson’s recent announcement that it will no longer ship EVs to Hawaii complicate the market outlook, but the days in which EVs were considered a rarity in Hawaii are over.

The Tesla Model Y, despite a drop in sales, is the third-most-popular vehicle in the state, according to Hawaii Auto Outlook, two notches below the Toyota Tacoma, which has long taken the top spot.

Hawaii also has been recognized as a top state in the U.S. for EV adoption.

J.D. Power last year ranked Hawaii third, behind California and Washington, in EV adoption based on an index weighing consumer preferences and availability. Hawaii was also among the top five EV markets, with EVs making up nearly 12% of new vehicle sales in the state.

Achieving EV equity

“We see an increase in EV registrations, so it’s steadily heading in the right direction, but obviously, not fast enough,” said Jeff Mikulina of Climate Hawaii. “The timing is very unfortunate for these new changes.”

While perks help get people in the door, he said, Hawaii needs a clean transportation program that works for everyone.

“So I think it’s on the state, now, particularly with this Navahine settlement, to really focus on equity and infrastructure, and making those take center stage,” he said.

That means making EVs more accessible for families, renters, and rural communities, he said, and investing in more charging stations, particularly for multifamily units — and doing everything possible to make clean transportation “the default as opposed to a luxury.”

DOT released a 205-page draft of its plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as part of a settlement of a lawsuit – Navahine vs. DOT — filed by a group of young climate activists.

Public comments on the draft were due by the end of Sunday.

As a legislator, Lowen has introduced bills seeking to expand EV charging infrastructure, including one offering rebates for EV-ready parking stalls in new affordable housing developments.

Morin agreed much more needs to be done to accelerate the adoption of EVs in the state if Hawaii is to reach its clean-energy goals.

Hawaii consumes nearly 40 million gallons of gasoline and diesel each month, and gas and diesel vehicles still make up 93% of all registered passenger vehicles in the state.

“It’s not just about EVs,” Morin said. “It’s about sustainable transportation. It’s about efficient transportation.”

That includes expanding other options like public transit, biking, walking, and rideshares.

“We want to be independent of fossil fuel imports,” Morin said. “We don’t want to be dependent on ships coming in to turn on our lights, transport our kids, or do our jobs. One way to do that is to achieve these goals.”

While it’s going to “take a little longer to make it happen,” he said, it doesn’t change the urgency of those aspirations.

Education is still a part of it, and Hawaii EV is hosting events locally from Sept. 12 to Oct. 12 to raise awareness on the numerous benefits of electric cars, trucks, and motorcycles as part of National Drive Electric Month.

Mikulina said the timing of the federal cutbacks is unfortunate, but is nevertheless confident that market demand for EVs will not go away, as global trends show the future is electric.

“Really, I think the momentum is so strong to electrify transportation and for clean energy,” said Mikulina, “that this is this is just a speed hump.”

CHANGES AFOOT FOR EV DRIVERS

>> On Sept. 30, the right to use the HOV lane during rush hour by solo EV drivers ends.

>> Where are HOV lanes? Oahu, the most populated isle in Hawaii, is home to most HOV lanes, which are available on the H-1 highway weekday mornings, as well as on H-2, Nimitz, Moanalua, and Kalanianaole highways.

>> On Sept. 30, federal tax credits of up to $7,500 for the purchase of eligible new EVs, and up to $4,000 for used EVs expires. These tax credits were originally set to last through Dec. 31, 2032, under the Inflation Reduction Act.

>> What to know: The IRS says a contract signed or down payment made for an EV before Sept. 30 is still eligible, even if the car is delivered at a later time. The vehicle must be acquired with a written binding contract before Sept. 30.

>> Starting in July, Hawaii EV owners could choose between paying a per-mile road usage charge of $8 per 1,000 miles, capped at $50, or annual fee of $50 (replacing the $50 EV surcharge). In 2028, all EV owners must pay the per-mile usage charge.

The EV transition is disrupting trillions of dollars of annual cash flows, and not just in the oil industry. People who stand to lose in that transition are working hard to delay the change, primarily by spreading FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt).The recently passed Federal budget bill adds two new sources of uncertainty, by eliminating the electric vehicle tax credits, and by attempting to renege on previous commitments to fund EV charging infrastructure. Like most political footballs, the impacts of these will probably be neither as good nor as bad as the opposing parties claim, but the fear, uncertainty and doubt are themselves a big problem.

FUD creates inertia, causing people who might otherwise care deeply about the benefits of BEVs and PHEVs to buy ""just one more"" vehicle that can't be plugged in. And that, in turn, locks in the status quo for 30 more years, at least for that one vehicle. A little reflection is in order.First, it's unconscionable that the administration that brought us DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) should threaten to rescind funding for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) charger installations on the claimed basis of the pace of the buildout. That pace was dictated by the accountability protocols of the bipartisan infrastructure bill that authorized NEVI.

But EV opponents have never lacked for hypocrisy, and there are plenty of public EV chargers already in place, with many more on the way. If you look on plugshare.com, you'll see that you can already drive an EV anywhere in the U.S. with little or no inconvenience, as long as you do your homework.Second, not all EVs are eligible for tax credits today. There are strict limits relating to price, where the battery materials come from, and where the vehicles are built. Manufacturers and dealers price their vehicles to match whatever the market will bear, and use a host of tricks (rebates, lease terms, trade-in values, monthly payments, etc.) to disguise the real price. The prices they accept, dictated by market realities, are quite flexible, even if they are highly inscrutable. But currently ineligible vehicles are unlikely to see major price changes when their competitors lose their tax advantage, and previously eligible vehicles will still have to compete.Third, the competition is heating up, with more electric vehicle models on the market every day. U.S. politics may be highly dysfunctional, but the rest of the world recognizes the value of electrification, and isn't sitting still. Putin's war on Ukraine lit a fire under Europe for energy security, leading to major increases in EV market share in most European countries. In Norway, long a leader, over 95 percent of new cars sold are now electric. The Chinese government made a command decision to go electric over 35 years ago, for similar reasons. We'll see how long Congress continues to abdicate its responsibility for tariffs and other taxation, but the impact of those foreign EVs is coming to the United States, even if the cars themselves are somehow kept out.Finally, if you remain convinced that the sky is falling, you can buy an EV and still get the tax credit (up to $7,500 for new EVs, and up to $4,000 for used) until Sept. 30. It's available as an instant rebate when you buy the car. You just have to sign one form at the dealer, and include another one with your tax return next April.There are many other bogus narratives (about charging, price, size, environmental issues, and more) out there. But a quick look at a few real EVs and a short talk with a few real EV drivers can easily dispel the lies and clear up the FUD. National Drive Electric Month (NDEM) exists to provide those opportunities. The Blue Ridge EV Club will hold its 12th annual NDEM event on Sunday, Sept. 14th at the Tanger Asheville Outlets Mall on Brevard Road. For more information, see driveelectricmonth.org.

As a result, the PSC exhibits a high PCE of 23.19% while it exhibits high stability.","Facet and lattice engineering strategies for PSCs

Designing suitable facet and lattice for perovskites can enhance the performance of PSCs. Utilization of suitable additive can afford the growth of perovskite with suitable facet, and that can enhance the performance of PSCs. Ma et al.75 have demonstrated facet-dependent degradation and facet engineering to achieve stable PSCs. The FAPbI3 with the dominant (100) facet exhibits much higher degradation for moisture when compared to the FAPbI3 with the dominant (111) facet. The key mechanisms of facet-dependent degradation of FAPbI3 films are provided based on theoretical and experimental studies. An elongated Pb−I bond distance is formed due to the strong water adhesion on the FAPbI3 with the dominant (100) facet, and thus a new δ-phase is formed on the (100) facet, which is attributed to the poor stability of the dominant (100) facet. Therefore, a larger surface fraction of the (111) facet is prepared by utilizing cyclohexylamine (boiling point: 134 °C) as an additive to selectively prefer the growth of the (111) facet, and the FAPbI3 with the dominated (111) facet exhibits much higher stability against moisture. The Fig. 2a depicts the XRD pattern of the FAPbI3 with the cyclohexylamine additive, where the FAPbI3 exhibits peaks for both (111) and (100) facets, but the dominant peak is for the (111) facet. A large triangular (111) facet on the individual crystal with fewer lateral (100) facets is observed from the FAPbI3 with cyclohexylamine additive, as shown in Fig. 2b (SEM image), which is contrast to the SEM image of the FAPbI3 with the dominant (100) facet (without additive). The XRD pattern of FAPbI3 with the dominant (111) facet corroborates with the SEM image (the large triangular (111) facet). The exposed-area percentage of the (111) facets from five crystals of the FAPbI3 with and without cyclohexylamine additive is approximately calculated using larger-area SEM images, where the FAPbI3 with cyclohexylamine additive exhibits 85–98% (Fig. 2c) for the (111) facets when compared to that of the control (40–55%). Hence, the FAPbI3 with cyclohexylamine additive exhibits a predominant enlarged (111) facet by diminishing the moisture-sensitive (100) facet, which could be attributed to the selective absorption of the cyclohexylamine additive, and that can diminish the surface energy of the (111) facet. The moisture stability of the FAPbI3 with the cyclohexylamine additive is compared with that of the FAPbI3 without the additive after exposure to 30–40% relative humidity in the air. In the XRD spectra, the FAPbI3 with cyclohexylamine additive exhibits negligible reduction of both (100) peak and dominant (111) peak intensities after exposure for ∼1000 h in moisture (green line; Fig. 2d, top) when compared to that of the unexposed film (black dashed line), which is corroborated with the PL spectra (Fig. 2e, top; a slight peak shift is observed after exposure), where the slight peak shift can be attributed to the phase segregation of FA. Nevertheless, in the XRD spectra, the FAPbI3 without additive exhibits an obvious reduction (~30%) in the dominant (100) peak intensity after exposure for ∼1000 h in moisture (green line; Fig. 2d, bottom) when compared to that of the unexposed film (black dashed line), while a new obvious peak for δ-phase is observed after exposure, which is corroborated with the PL spectra (Fig. 2e, bottom; the obvious reduction in the peak intensity is observed after exposure), which is attributed to the generation of non-radiative recombination centers possibly due to the formation of δ-phase on the (100) facet. Hence, the PSC (FAPbI3 with the dominant (111) facet) exhibits exceptional PCE of 24% (Table 2), with high stability (95% retention for ∼2000 h (Fig. 2f) at 30–40% relative humidity for the device without encapsulation).

The utilization of topochemical assembly strategy can afford the growth of perovskite with suitable orientation, and that can diminish lattice heterogeneity, electronic disorder, and microstructure defects, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Zhu et al.116 have demonstrated that the lattice heterogeneity is minimized by topochemical assembly in polycrystalline halide perovskites to enhance the stability of the PSCs. The mechanisms of topochemical assembly are investigated, where a solid-solid transition is usually observed along the interface of PbI2/perovskite. An alternative pathway for crystal growth along a different coherent interface is achieved due to the introduction of intermediates. Therefore, an optimal (001)-oriented perovskite film is prepared, which possesses reduced lattice heterogeneity, electronic disorder, and microstructure defects. As a result, the PSC exhibits a high PCE of 24.5%, while it exhibits high stability (99% retention for 2500 h by MPP tracking test; 95% retention (one sun, AM 1.5 G) for 500 h (IEC61215 protocols)).

Introduction of pentafluoroanilinium trifluoromethanesulfonate into PbI2 precursor solutions can afford preferred orientation, decrease defects, and enlarge grains, and that can enhance the performance of PSCs. Shao et al.117 have demonstrated the promoted preferential perovskite orientation growth due to the modulation of nucleation and crystallization in PbI2 films by incorporating pentafluoroanilinium trifluoromethanesulfonate into PbI2 precursor solutions to enhance the performance of PSCs. In this case, the modulatory PbI2 films serve as porous templates that promote the formation of perovskites with reduced PbI2 residues, a preferred orientation, decreased defects, and enlarged grains, possibly due to the acceleration of the formation of perovskite and the diminished Gibbs free energy of PbI2. Hence, the PSC exhibits outstanding PCE of 24.52%, while it exhibits high stability (~90% retention for 500 h in an N2 atmosphere at ∼55 °C under constant light irradiation by the MPP tracking test).

Utilization of reconstruction subsurface lattice strategy can afford the growth of perovskite with suitable crystal lattice, modulate the valence band alignment, diminish defects, enhance the carrier-selective transfer and improve the charge carrier lifetime, and that can enhance the performance of PSCs. Gao et al.118 have applied the reconstruction subsurface lattice strategy to achieve stable PSCs; while using this strategy, the positions of the I− and Pb2+ planes are simultaneously modulated. The corner-sharing octahedral is preferred, and high stability is achieved in the crystal lattice by the reconstructed lattice configuration, thereby stabilizing FA-based perovskites. Furthermore, the subsurface lattice reconstruction modulates the valence band alignment and diminishes defects, which enhances the carrier-selective transfer and improves the charge carrier lifetime. Consequently, the PSC exhibits a remarkable PCE of 25.2%, while it exhibits high stability (95% retention for 3000 h under illumination of simulated AM 1.5 by MPP tracking test; 96% retention for 6000 h of storage in a dry box at 25 °C under ∼20% relative humidity).

Various facet/lattice engineering strategies, including utilization of cyclohexylamine as an additive75, topochemical assembly strategy116, incorporating pentafluoroanilinium trifluoromethanesulfonate into PbI2 precursor solutions117, and reconstruction subsurface lattice strategy118, enhanced the efficiency and/or stability of the PSCs.

Strategies for defect/grain engineering and passivation for PSCs

Defect/grain engineering can improve the performance of the PSCs. Tuning the reaction kinetics through anion-π interaction of the AX component of ABX3 perovskite can decrease the defects, and afford high phase purity, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Huang et al.67 have tuned the reaction kinetics through anion-π interaction of the AX component of ABX3 perovskite with hexafluorobenzene, which is an alternative strategy to conventional methods that rely on the BX2 component. These two strategies are independent, but they work together to attain ‘dual-site regulation’, which leads to delicate control over the reaction of AX with BX2 without unwanted intermediates. As a result, the FAPbI3 perovskite film affords red-shifted absorption, lesser defects, and high phase purity without measurable nanoscale δ phase. Hence, the PSC exhibits a superior PCE of 26.07% and excellent stability (94% retention for 1258 h by MPP tracking test).

Lattice strains and phase transitions can be induced in halide perovskites by the variations in the daily temperature, and that can affect the stability of the PSCs. Therefore, developing PSCs that can be stable at variable temperature (ambient, low, and high temperature) is highly desirable. The introduction of suitable polymer with ordered dipolar structure into the perovskite precursor can stabilize the perovskite black phase, promote the growth of a low-defect crystalline film, generate the dipoles at the surface of the perovskite, diminish ion migration, enhance interfacial charge extraction, enhance hydrophobicity, and that can enhance the performance of PSCs at variable temperature. Li et al.78 have utilized the ordered dipolar structure of β-poly(1,1-difluoroethylene) (β-pV2F) for the stabilization of the perovskite black phase to enhance the performance of PSC by controlling the energy alignment and perovskite film crystallization. Therefore, the PSC exhibits enhanced PCE of 24.6% (Table 3), and it exhibits high stability (88 and 96% retention for 1000 h by MPP tracking test at 75° and 25 °C, respectively), while negligible signs of fatigue are observed for the PSCs at rapid thermal cycling between +80 °C and −60 °C, suggesting its high thermal cycling stability. The β-pV2F exhibits an ordered molecular dipole distribution due to the polymeric backbone of the β-pV2F and alternate symmetric hydro and fluorocarbon units. β-pV2F with 0.5 mg/mL (molecular weight: 180,000) had been used. Figure 3 depicts the role of β-pV2F on the work function and film morphology. The control perovskite film exhibits evident voids at the grain boundaries (average grain size: ~400 nm; Fig. 3a−c), where non-radiative recombination centers and shunting paths can be formed due to these defects. In contrast, the β-pV2F-treated perovskite film exhibits high density with large grain size (~480 nm; Fig. 3d−f). The XRD of the β-pV2F-treated perovskite film exhibits improved crystallinity as inferred from a smaller full width at half maximum in the (001) peak. The atomic force microscopy studies disclose that the β-pV2F-treated perovskite film exhibits a lesser surface roughness of 41.1 nm when compared to that of the control (54.4 nm), which can ameliorate coverage with charge-transporting layers. The adjacent hydrogen atoms in β-pV2F can have a partial positive charge density due to the fluorine atoms with electron-withdrawing effect. Furthermore, the β-pV2F exhibits an all-trans planar zigzag conformation, which is almost similar to a Lewis acid, and that can interact with the surface of the perovskite. In the FTIR spectra, the β-pV2F-treated perovskite film exhibits the –CH2 stretching vibration peak at 3019 cm−1 when compared to that of bare β-pV2F (3025 cm−1), possibly due to a solid C-H···X dipole interaction of –CH2 moieties with halide ions of the [PbX6]4− frame. Thus, the β-pV2F-treated perovskite film exhibits an upward shift of the surface work function (Fig. 3g), possibly due to the change in crystallization during film growth caused by the aforementioned polar interaction between β-pV2F and precursors. Therefore, the β-pV2F-treated perovskite film exhibits an increase in surface work function up to 300 meV (Fig. 3h) when compared to that of the control, and that can enhance the interfacial charge extraction and improve the stability of PSC.

Effective rejuvenated of aged perovskite quantum dots can be achieved through in situ defect healing treatment. Chen et al.119 have effectively rejuvenated aged perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) using in situ defect healing treatment (DHT). Theoretical calculations and experimental studies disclose that the surface matrix defects of aged PQDs could be strongly anchored by the I3− anions generated from tetra-n-octylammonium iodide and iodine, which can considerably reduce the non-radiative recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. Furthermore, the morphology of aged PQDs could be renovated by DHT, which can enhance the stacking orientation of PQD solids and considerably ameliorate charge carrier transport within PQD solids. As a result, the PSC exhibits a high PCE of 15.88%, while it exhibits high stability (60% retention for 200 h by MPP tracking test).

Utilization of suitable grain modulator can consolidate the crystal structure, while utilization of redox-active radical polymer can effectively p-dope the hole-transporting material through hole injection, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. You et al.68 have performed two strategies (grain modulation and radical polymeric p-doping) to enhance the performance of the PSC. A phosphonic acid-functionalized fullerene derivative is introduced in mixed-cation perovskites as a modulator for the grain boundary to consolidate the crystal structure, thereby improving the resistance of the perovskite sheet against heat, moisture, and illumination. Furthermore, the poly(oxoammonium salt) as a redox-active radical polymer is used to effectively p-dope the hole-transporting material through hole injection, which also inhibits the diffusion of lithium ions. Hence, the PSC and mini-module demonstrate satisfactory PCE of 23.5% (1 cm2) and 21.4% (17.1 cm2), respectively, while maintains high stability (95.5% retention for 3265 h by MPP tracking test at 70° ± 5 °C).

Several strategies have been applied to enhance the passivation of the perovskites to enhance the performance of PSCs. The library of low-dimensional capping materials with metal cations can be expanded by processing a full precursor solution with both metal and ammonium halides rather than the commonly used Pb2+ and Sn2+, where a zero-dimensional zinc-based halogenometallate can induce stronger n–N isotype three-dimensional/low-dimensional heterojunctions and higher surface passivation when compared to its lead-based counterpart, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Ye et al.69 have expanded the library of low-dimensional capping materials with metal cations rather than the commonly used Pb2+ and Sn2+ by processing a full precursor solution with both metal and ammonium halides. Thus, facile synthetic control is achieved for the low-dimensional capping layer, while greater versatility is attained for low-dimensional interface engineering. Therefore, a 0D PEA2ZnX4 (zinc-based halogenometallate; PEA = phenethylammonium, X = Cl/I) exhibits much higher surface passivation and robust n-N isotype 3D/low-dimensional heterojunctions when compared to that of lead-based counterpart. The resulted PSC exhibits a superior PCE of 24.1% with high stability (94.5% retention for 1009 h by MPP tracking test).

Utilization of dimethylacridine-based molecular doping process can effectively passivate the grain boundaries, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Tan et al.120 have demonstrated a dimethylacridine-based molecular doping process to build a well-matched p-perovskite/ITO contact with passivation of grain boundaries to attain enhanced performance for PSCs. Thus, a molecule-extrusion process occurs, where the molecules can be extruded to the grain boundaries from the precursor solution, while the crystallization process occurs at the bottom of the film surface in the chlorobenzene-quenching process. The core coordination complex of lead polyiodide of perovskite with the deprotonated phosphonic acid group of the molecule is accountable for both electronic charge transfer and mechanical absorption, and that cause p-type doping of the perovskite film. As a result, the PSC exhibits a high PCE of 25.86%, while it exhibits high stability (96.6% retention for 1000 h by MPP tracking test).

Utilization of pseudo-halide anion engineering strategy can effectively passivate the surface, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Xu et al.121 have performed pseudo-halide anion engineering for bifunctional surface passivation to enhance the performance of PSCs, while a machine learning workflow is demonstrated to facilitate the discovery process through full-DFT calculations for training the model. Thus, promising molecules with a head group can be identified through the physics-informed machine learning model, and that inhibits anti-site defect generation and lattice distortion, while a tail group is optimized for robust attachment to the surface. Furthermore, 15 potential bifunctional pseudo-halide anions having the ability to passivate both acceptors and donors are identified, where the most effective passivant is sodium thioglycolate. As a consequence, this strategy contributes to PSC with unexceptional PCE of 24.56% and robust stability (96% retention for 900 h by MPP tracking test).

Utilization of ligand reactivity engineering strategy can afford stable PSCs at high-temperatures. Park et al.122 have demonstrated ligand reactivity engineering to achieve stable PSCs at high-temperatures. Ammonium ligands are utilized, which are non-reactive with the bulk of perovskites, while a library is determined that alters ligand molecular structure systematically. Thus, fluorinated aniliniums exhibit interfacial passivation and, at the same-time, reduce reactivity with perovskites. Hence, the PSC exhibits a large PCE of 24.09%, while it exhibits high stability (85% retention for 1560 h by MPP tracking test at 85 °C and 50% relative humidity).

Introduction of insulator layer having optimal thickness with random nanoscale openings between the absorber and transport layer can diminish surface recombination, while the crystallinity and bulk recombination lifetime can also be enhanced, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Peng et al.123 have introduced ∼100-nm-thick insulator layers with random nanoscale openings between the absorber and transport layer without deteriorating both the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and the fill factor (FF) to diminish surface recombination and achieve high-performance PSCs. Drift-diffusion simulations are conducted for cells having this porous-insulator contact and comprehended with a solution process through managing the growth mode of Al2O3 nanoplates. Thus, the 87.9% of the Shockley-Queisser limit is the product of Voc × FF, while the surface recombination velocity was diminished to 9.2 cm s−1 from 64.2 cm s−1 at the p-type contact, and the bulk recombination lifetime is elevated to 6.0 μs from 1.2 μs due to the enhancement in the crytallinity of perovskite. As a result, the PSC with a porous-insulator contact with a ∼25% diminished contact area exhibits a high PCE of 25.56%, while it exhibits high stability (>98% retention for 1000 h by MPP tracking test).

Utilization of in situ tin selenide deposition strategy can enhance the surface crystallization and diminish the number of surface traps, and that can enhance the performance of PSCs. Chen et al.124 have obtained PEA2(FA0.5MA0.5)4(Pb0.5Sn0.5)5I16 (n = 5) with a gradient structure through a two-step blade coating. Furthermore, improved surface crystallization and a diminished number of surface traps are observed for the perovskite films after treatment with tin (II) acetate and N,N-dimethylselenourea, due to the in situ generation of tin selenide, where the active layer is well protected from the environment by this hydrophobic tin selenide. Therefore, the PSC exhibits PCE of 15.06% with a VOC of 0.855 V and negligible hysteresis, while it exhibits high stability (100% retention for 15 h by MPP tracking test).

Utilization of crystallization strategy can passivate the defects and enhance the crystallization, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Zhang et al.125 have demonstrated holistic defect passivation and crystallization manipulation through the crystallization strategy via a novel intermediate phase to construct high-quality perovskite films to achieve high-performance PSCs. Thus, the orientational growth of the α-phase perovskite is promoted during crystallization after introducing phenformin hydrochloride (PFCl) into the precursor solution, where the intermediate phase PFCl•FAI diminishes the formation of the δ yellow phase. Furthermore, a post-treatment is performed using multiactive-site S-methylisothiosemicarbazide hydroiodide, leading to a reduction in the bulk and interfacial trap-assisted non-radiative recombination losses, which is attributed to diminished defects, enhanced crystallization, and released residual stress. As a result, the PSC exhibits a high PCE of 24.67%, while it exhibits high light and thermal stability (94% retention for 600 h by MPP tracking test; 84% retention for 1008 h at constant light illumination; 90% retention for 864 h at constant heating at 85 °C).

Utilization of surface n-type band bending strategy can enable the p to n-type transition at the surface and passivate the defects, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Wang et al.126 have demonstrated a surface n-type band bending strategy to alleviate the severe energy losses in inverted PSCs at the interface between the n-type ETL and p-type perovskite. Furthermore, a p to n-type transition is observed at the surface of the CsPbI3 due to the post-deposition of propylamine hydrochloride to expedite the extraction and separation of the electrons while passivating the defects of the surface. Hence, the PSC exhibits an outstanding PCE of 20.17% (38.93% at indoor light illumination using LED with 307 mW cm−2 having 1000 lux) with robust stability (∼97% retention for 792 h in light soaking at the open circuit condition).

The α-phase of FAPbI3 can be stabilized without band gap broadening by utilizing suitable cations and anions. Yoo et al.127 have utilized R4N+ cations and Cl− anions for the stabilization of the α-phase of FAPbI3 without band gap broadening. The resulted PSC and module exhibit unexpected PCE of 24.53% and 21.23% (36.4 cm2), respectively, while the perovskite solar module exhibits high stability (93% retention for 870 h at constant one-sun illumination).

The utilization of two alkylammonium halide modulators can inhibit halide phase segregation and enhance passivation, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. In addition, Alharbi et al.128 have utilized two alkylammonium halide modulators to enhance the stability and PCE of PSCs based on FA0.65MA0.35Pb(I0.65Br0.35)3 and α-FAPbI3, where the modulators inhibit halide phase segregation induced by light in the former. The 2D NMR studies disclose that the modulators are found at grain boundaries and surfaces, while the computational studies reveal that the modulators exhibit a higher passivation effect when compared to that of established compounds. Therefore, the PSC based on α-FAPbI3 exhibits a high PCE of 24.9%, while it exhibits high stability (∼90% retention for 1200 h by MPP tracking test).

The utilization of suitable surface passivation can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Hieulle et al.129 have discovered the effect of white light in the degradation of the surface of FAPbI3-rich perovskite absorbers through computational studies and multiscale characterization techniques. Thus, the degradation kinetics are investigated, where the chemical degradation of perovskite into secondary phases with metallic I-V characteristics and a larger work function is triggered by the white light. In addition, the degradation of perovskite has been triggered by a synergetic effect of the defects in perovskite and the illumination of light. In addition, surface passivation is performed to determine the effect of defect sensitivity in the degradation process. Furthermore, the light-induced degradation of perovskite with respect to the wavelength is determined by utilizing filtered light. Therefore, the PSC exhibits a large PCE of 22%, while it exhibits high stability (75% retention for 500 h by MPP tracking test).

The utilization of solid-phase passivation strategy can alleviate the usage of solvents for passivation, enhance the passivation and diminish the carrier non-radiative recombination loss, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Luo et al.130 have utilized 2-mercaptopyridine as a passivator on pre-prepared solid-state films to bond surface uncoordinated Pb2+ defects through a solvent-free solid-phase passivation (SPP) route rather than the conventional solution processing route. Furthermore, owing to the robust coordination ability of the passivator with the uncoordinated Pb2+ defects, the passivator is found to anchor on the defect sites of the surface of the perovskite film even if the passivator film is destroyed. Thus, the defect passivation considerably diminishes the carrier non-radiative recombination loss. Hence, the PSC exhibits an excellent PCE of 25.2%, a high VOC of 1.20 V, and a low voltage loss of 0.34 V, while it exhibits high stability (92% retention for 800 h by MPP tracking test).

Utilization of organic iodides can enhance the energy barrier for iodine interstitial migration and improve the defect passivation, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Ren et al.131 have utilized organic iodides to enhance the performance of the PSCs. Thus, the energy barrier for iodine interstitial (Ii) migration is increased by the organic iodides with suitable cations, possibly due to their strong interaction with the surface of the perovskite, where the interaction emerges from a high dipole moment and a stable steric alignment. The role of four classical phenylalkylammonium iodides on Ii migration is studied, where the length of the alkyl chain of cations possesses influence on the inhibition of Ii migration. As a result of Ii migration inhibition and defect passivation on the surface of the perovskite film, the phenylpropylammonium iodide-treated PSC exhibits a high PCE of 24.2%, while it exhibits high stability (92% retention for 240 h by MPP tracking test).

Utilization of phase transition engineering strategy can improve the crystallinity, and modulate the energy levels, conductivity, carrier mobility, and trap states, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Chen et al.132 have utilized a holistic strategy to enhance carrier transportation in a SnO2/perovskite stack. At first, the NT:SnO2 is obtained by co-doping Nb5+ and Ta5+ with SnO2, which can modulate the energy levels, conductivity, carrier mobility, and trap states, while the NT:SnO2 tunes the crystallization process of the perovskites, leading to improved crystallinity. Furthermore, carrier lifetime is increased to >3 μs, and non-radiative recombination is considerably decreased after the introduction of 4,4’-dithiodibutyric acid as a multifunctional passivator molecule to subsequently passivate the charged traps in perovskites. As a result, the PSC exhibits satisfactory PCE of 25.3%, while it exhibits high stability (90% retention for 1200 h by MPP tracking test).

Utilization of interfacial-engineering method can effectively passivate the defects and diminish the trap densities, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Kim et al.133 have demonstrated an interfacial-engineering approach containing the in situ thermal phase transition of AAFos (AAFos: alkylammonium formates) to effectively passivate the defects to enhance the performance of PSCs. AAFos is composed of a big organic cation with a pseudohalide anion, which can be involved at relatively low temperatures in the passivation process as the liquid phase due to the weak coordination between the anions and cations. Thus, the AAFos exhibits several merits in interfacial engineering: (a) The grain boundaries of perovskites can be effectively passivated by the AAFos to diminish the trap densities by improving the liquid-like behavior of the AAFo. (b) The effective passivation at iodide vacancies is achieved to enhance the thermal stability due to the formate anion, where the fromate anion has a comparatively larger affinity with iodide vacancies when compared to that of other halides. (c) The moisture stability is enhanced by the decylammonium cations with lengthy alkyl chain which inhibits the permeation of moisture into the perovskite layer. Therefore, the PSC and module exhibit high PCE of 25% and 20.82% (23.75 cm2), respectively, while the PSC exhibits high thermal and moisture stability.

Utilization of suitable aging-resistant precursor can afford higher crystallinity and larger grain size, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Huang et al.134 have added 2,3,5-trichlorobenzaldehyde with chloride ions and a C═O group (3Cl-BZH; Fig. 4a) into the solution (organic salt precursor) to alleviate the excess organic amine formation by Schiff-base reactions, and that enhances the stability of the precursor solution and prevents further irreversible amine-cation reactions of formamidine-methylammonium (FA-MA+). The FTIR is performed to investigate the interaction of 3Cl-BZH with organic salt (Fig. 4b, c). The stretching vibration peak of C═O exhibits a shift to 1638 cm−1 from 1628 cm−1, and the stretching vibration peak of N─H exhibits a shift to 3451 cm−1 from 3438 cm−1 after mixing FAI with 3Cl-BZH, suggesting the existence of a chemical interaction of the C═O group of 3Cl-BZH with FA+. Thus, slower black phase formation is occurring, possibly due to the delay of the reaction of FAI with PbI2 after the addition of 3Cl-BZH. Therefore, a higher crystallinity and larger grain size of perovskite are obtained due to the delayed organic ion release and slow reaction when compared to the original unannealed film, as shown in Fig. 4d. Figure 4e depicts the schematic diagram that illustrates the role of 3Cl-BZH on the crystallization process of perovskite films. If 3Cl-BZH is not used, a rapid reaction can occur between FAI and PbI2, which can form a perovskite layer on top of PbI2, inhibit the diffusion of FAI into the inner PbI2 layer, and provide a perovskite phase with low crystallinity and excess PbI2 residues. In contrast, the diffusion rate of FAI within the PbI2 matrix has been slowed down after the introduction of 3Cl-BZH, leading to the gradual crystallization of perovskite nuclei, while the interaction of 3Cl-BZH with FAI enhances the perovskite reaction, resulting in the generation of an orderly and uniform organic salt layer, leading to the formation of high-quality perovskite films. Therefore, the PSC with 3Cl-BZH (with defect passivation effect) using a conventional annealing process exhibits a high PCE of 24.08% and high stability, while it exhibits a high PCE of 22.01% after broadening the annealing window of the wet perovskite sheet in the air atmosphere to 240 h, suggesting its prospects towards commercialization.

Utilization of room-temperature molten salt-mediated perovskite growth strategy using dimethylamine formate can afford low-defect density and a large grain size, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Zai et al.135 have added dimethylamine formate (DMAFa, a room-temperature molten salt) into the precursor solution to control the crystallization behavior of CsPbI3 perovskite films. The coordination of DMAFa with Pb2+ can form HCOO−-Pb2+ in the initial stage, and subsequent annealing gradually decompose the HCOO−-Pb2+ into I−-Pb2+, leading to a delay in crystallization rate, while the defects of the perovskite films can be passivated by the interaction of DMA+ with the uncoordinated Pb2+, and that generates a high-quality CsPbI3 film with a low-defect density and a large grain size. As a result, the PSC exhibits a high PCE of 20.4% while it exhibits high stability.

In situ polymerization of cross-linked perovskite-polymer composites can enhance the crystallinity and increase the grain size, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Guo et al.136 have demonstrated cross-linked perovskite-polymer composites with in situ polymerization to enhance the performance of PSCs, where the acrylamide monomers are cross-linked with the assistance of light to the non-crystalline perovskite films. The preferred crystal orientation in the polycrystalline perovskite films is induced by the acrylamide monomers, and the perovskite grain size is enlarged while the perovskite grains are cross-linked. The cross-linked interfacial layer protects the perovskite film against water corrosion, where this layer acts as an airtight wall. Furthermore, the lattice strain during perovskite-film crystallization is effectively released by the liquid properties of acrylamide. Hence, the PSC and module exhibit remarkable PCE of 24.45% and 20.31% (33 cm2), respectively, and the PSC exhibits high stability, while it exhibits a high VOC of 1.199 V, which is a higher VOC than that previously reported for promising hybrid PSCs with TiO2 as ETLs.

The utilization of suitable ionic liquid as co-solvent can modulate the crystallinity, and afford interfacial band alignment and effective charge transport of the screen-printed film, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Chen et al.137 have demonstrated the fabrication of fully screen-printed perovskite solar cells with a high PCE of 16.95% towards commercialization through modulating confined perovskite crystallization within the mesoporous layer. The complete volatilization of ionic liquid methylamine acetate (MAAc) is achieved, and perovskite crystals with high filling degree within the mesoporous structure are attained due to the addition of ionic liquid MAPa (MAPa: methylamine propionate) with robust coordination as a co-solvent to stimulate the escape of MAAc molecules, where volatilization channels for solvent are generated in a confined mesoporous structure. Additionally, interfacial band alignment and effective charge transport of the screen-printed film are achieved due to the MAPa, where the vertical growth of perovskite crystals is stimulated by MAPa and the unbonded Pb2+ is coordinated by MAPa on the surface of the perovskite. Hence, the PSC exhibits a high PCE of 16.95%, while it exhibits high stability (∼85.3% retention for 250 h by MPP tracking test).

Utilization of halogenated phenylethylammonium iodide salts can effectively tune the passivation of the perovskite, while the meta-substituted cations can afford better performance than that of ortho and para counterparts, which could be due to the higher interfacial dipoles and lower formation energies, and that could enhance the performance of the PSCs. Gozukara Karabag et al.138 have modulated the passivation of 2D perovskite, while the role of steric and electronic effects on the performance of 3D/2D PSCs has been investigated. Thus, several halogenated PEA+ iodide salts are prepared through the facile route, and the salts are deposited on the top of 3D perovskite, where the salts are x-XPEAI (x is ortho (o), meta (m), or para (p); X is F, Cl, or Br). The grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering analyses and XRD investigation disclose the formation of a 2D perovskite layer for all cations, irrespective of the position and nature of the halogen. Theoretical calculations disclose that m-substituted cations exhibit higher performance when compared to their o- and p- counterparts owing to their higher interfacial dipoles and lower formation energies. Therefore, the PSC with m-BrPEAI exhibits a high PCE of 23.42%, while the PSC with m-ClPEAI exhibits high stability (87% retention for 1000 h by MPP tracking test).

The utilization of β-alaninamide hydrochloride can generate in situ formation of 2D perovskite seeding, which can enhance the quality of crystallization, provide uniformity of perovskite film, and that can enhance the performance of indoor PSCs. Li et al.139 have utilized β-alaninamide hydrochloride, which spontaneously generates a layer of 2D perovskite nucleation seeds, to enhance the quality of crystallization, uniformity of film, and performance of indoor PSCs. The charge carrier lifetime is increased 10-fold after the introduction of β-alaninamide hydrochloride due to the enhanced film quality with lesser lattice stress, smaller trap density, and better uniformity. Hence, the indoor PSCs presents impressive PCE of 42.12% (0.09 cm2), 40.93% (1.0 cm2), and 40.07% (2.56 cm2) with light intensity of 1000.52, 1000.69, and 1000.85 lux, respectively, with LED illumination, while it exhibits high stability.

Utilization of uracil as a binder in the perovskite film can strengthen grain boundaries, effectively passivate defects, strengthen the interface between ETL and perovskite, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Wang et al.79 have utilized uracil as a binder in the perovskite film to improve the performance of PSCs. The uracil can strengthen grain boundaries and effectively passivate defects to improve the stability of perovskite films, while it strengthens the interface between ETL (SnO2) and perovskite to enhance the binding force. Hence, the PSC exhibits a high PCE of 24.23% with negligible hysteresis and high reproducibility, while it exhibits robust stability (90% retention for 5960 h by MPP tracking test) and high reproducibility.

Utilization of surface in situ reconstruction strategy using CsF treatment can enhance hole extraction, inhibit non-radiative recombination, effectively passivate the surface defects, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Chu et al.140 have demonstrated a surface in situ reconstruction strategy to enhance the efficiency of the PSC through CsF treatment for inorganic perovskite to enhance hole extraction and inhibit non-radiative recombination, while the mechanism has been verified by experiments and kinetic calculations. Thus, effective passivation of surface defects can be achieved after the incorporation of fluorine, while a prolonged carrier lifetime of 737.2 ns is obtained from 11.5 ns. Additionally, a wider-bandgap perovskite layer can be formed as a graded heterojunction to enhance hole extraction. As a result, the PSC exhibits a high PCE of 21.02%, a fill factor of 85.3%, and an open-circuit voltage of 1.27 V, while it exhibits high stability (86% retention for 400 h by MPP tracking test).

Strategies for defect/grain engineering67,68,78,119 and passivation129 including expansion of the library of low-dimensional capping materials with metal cations69, dimethylacridine-based molecular doping process120, pseudo-halide anion engineering121, introduction of insulator layer having optimal thickness with random nanoscale openings between the absorber and transport layer123, in situ tin selenide deposition124, crystallization strategy125, surface n-type band bending strategy126, utilization of R4N+ cations and Cl− anions127, utilization of two alkylammonium halide modulators128, solvent-free solid-phase passivation route130, utilization of organic iodides131, phase transition engineering132, interfacial-engineering method133, utilization of aging-resistant precursor134, room-temperature molten salt-mediated perovskite growth135, in situ polymerization of cross-linked perovskite-polymer composites136, modulation of confined perovskite crystallization137, modulation of the passivation of 2D perovskite138, in situ formation of 2D perovskite seeding139, utilization of uracil as a binder into the perovskite film79, and surface in situ reconstruction strategy140 enhanced the efficiency and/or stability of the PSCs.

Dion–Jacobson/hybrid perovskite for PSCs

Designing suitable Dion–Jacobson (DJ)/hybrid perovskite can enhance the performance of PSCs. Utilization of triple-solvent engineering strategy can afford pure-phase, finely oriented crystal grains and a homogenous quantum well width structure for DJ-2D perovskites, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Ahmad et al.74 have designed 4APP(FA)3Pb4I13-based quasi-DJ-2D perovskite (4APP: 4-aminopiperidinium) to improve the stability of the PSCs. The 4APP possesses strong rigidity and robust hydrogen bonding ability with the perovskite, leading to an obvious increase in the intrinsic stability of the perovskite. The DJ-2D perovskites with pure-phase, finely oriented crystal grains and a homogenous quantum well width structure are obtained through the triple-solvent engineering strategy by coordinating solvent properties. Thus, the PCE of the unencapsulated PSCs is improved by 48% using MA-free DJ 2D perovskite (n ≤ 4). As a result, the PSC exhibits a high PCE of 17.27% (Table 4), while it exhibits high stability (95% retention for 2000 h at 40 °C by MPP tracking test for the unencapsulated device; 95% retention for >3000 h in air at 85 °C with 60–90% relative humidity).

The performance of the PSCs can be improved using 2D/3D heterostructure, where the amidino based DJ 2D perovskite can afford skeleton for 3D growth upon the dissolution-recrystallization process, which can diminish bulk defects and alleviate volume collapse. Yang et al.141 have utilized amidino-based Dion–Jacobson 2D perovskite to achieve stable and efficient FAPbI3-based 2D/3D heterostructure in PSCs. Time-resolved optical diagnostics is utilized to investigate the effect of DJ 2D perovskite on the nucleation and growth mechanisms and crystallization pathways of 3D perovskite. The crystallization process of the 2D/3D perovskite in comparison with the neat 3D perovskite is illustrated in Fig. 5. FA-rich α-phase perovskites are formed by the preferential crystallization of 3D perovskite during the following perovskite film fabrication processes, including spin coating, dissolution, and recrystallization, when the entrapped DMSO eliminates the bulk film in the course of thermal annealing. Thus, void generation at grain boundaries on 3D perovskite induced by the volume collapse of the crystals is observed due to the evaporation of DMSO and the uniform nucleation in the course of dissolution-recrystallization equilibrium. In contrast, the nucleation and growth pathways are altered and the volume collapse is inhibited by the DJ 2D perovskite, where a high-quality perovskite film with suppressed bulk defects and voids is obtained due to the modulated crystallization process, leading to efficient charge transport. Hence, the PSCs exhibit a high PCE of 24.9% (on rigid substrate) and 22.3% (on flexible substrate), while the PSC exhibits high stability, and high bending cycle stability for flexible solar cells (92% retention for 3000 bending cycles).

Utilization of suitable solvent and ligand for quasi-2D-DJ phases on 3D perovskites can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Ramakrishnan et al.142 have utilized 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol as a solvent and 3-aminomethylpyridine as a ligand for the fabrication of quasi-2D DJ phases on 3D perovskites to achieve enhanced performance for PSCs. In situ X-ray scattering is used to determine the structural evolution and solvent-mediated formation dynamics of 2D and 3D heterostructures. The spatial distribution of quasi-2D phases for n is from 2 to 4, and the formation sequence is determined by the interaction of the solvent with the 3D surface. When isoproponol is used as a solvent, the perovskite is reconstructed into a PbI2-rich surface, where a strata is generated with a smaller n first, and then a thinner substratum is formed with a larger n. However, when 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol is used as a solvent, the 3D surface is protected, thereby enhancing the generation of homogenously distributed larger n domains first and smaller n last. Thus, DJ perovskites have been utilized with excellent charge transport properties and structural robustness to construct 2D/3D heterostructures with n ≥ 3 and design a suitable energy landscape for electron tunneling. Hence, the PSC exhibits impressive PCE of 23.6%, with high stability (94% retention for 960 h at 85 °C).

Fabrication of organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite by incorporating a tiny amount of organic cations for inorganic cations can increase the optoelectronic properties, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Jiang et al.143 have prepared tetragonal (β-) (DMA, Cs)PbI3 by incorporating a tiny amount of DMA+ (large organic cation) for Cs+ with a small ionic radius, while the obvious evidence for the generation of organic-inorganic hybrids is provided. The hybrid organic-inorganic β-(DMA, Cs)PbI3 with a dominant inorganic composition exhibits higher optoelectronic properties when compared to that of inorganic orthorhombic (γ-phase) CsPbI3, suggesting the beneficial substitution of a small quantity of DMA+.As a result, the PSC exhibits a satisfactory PCE of 19.76%, while maintains high stability (95% retention for ~186 h by MPP tracking test).

Designing suitable Dion–Jacobson (DJ)/hybrid perovskite, including 4-aminopiperidinium-based quasi-DJ-2D perovskite74, amidino-based DJ-2D perovskite96, utilization of suitable solvent and ligand for quasi-2D-DJ phases on 3D perovskites142, and fabrication of organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite by incorporating a tiny amount of DMA+ for Cs+ 143 enhanced the efficiency and/or stability of the PSCs.

Strategies for using ambient conditions and/or water for the fabrication of PSCs

The fabrication of PSCs in ambient air and/or water can prevent the moisture-induced severe degradation of the perovskite layer, and that can trigger their industrialization. The introduction of guanabenz acetate salt can inhibit perovskite hydration, alleviate both anion and cation vacancies, and crystallize a high-quality film for the fabrication of PSCs in ambient air. Yan et al.71 have utilized guanabenz acetate salt to prevent perovskite hydration, obviate both anion and cation vacancies, and crystallize a high-quality film for the fabrication of PSCs in ambient air. Hence, the PSC exhibits a remarkable PCE of 25.32% (Table 5), while it exhibits high stability (96% retention for 500 h by MPP tracking test; 85% retention for 300 h under damp heat conditions with 85% relative humidity at 85 °C). The cause of the generation of good-quality perovskite sheet in ambient air was determined. There is an initial interaction stage of moisture with perovskite, but the hydration pathway is blocked by the utilization of guanabenz acetate salt, and thus a high-quality perovskite film is formed in ambient air. The left side of Fig. 6a depicts the mechanism of moisture-induced decomposition. The water molecules can be more easily bound in energetics with an atom exposed by a vacancy in perovskite at the initial stage of the hydration process. Consequently, FAI will be escaped and the Pb2I62− framework will be collapsed. The DFT calculations disclose the binding energy of water molecules with the perovskite (Fig. 6b) and the critical role of vacancies on hydration. FA+ and I− vacancies are readily generated during the deposition of the film. If I− vacancy occurs, then the binding energies are −1.450 eV for H2O with FA+, − 0.610 eV for H2O with Pb2+, and −1.189 eV for H2O with I−. If FA+ vacancy occurs, then the binding energies are −1.134 eV for H2O with FA+, −1.133 eV for H2O with Pb2+, and −1.461 eV for H2O with I−. However, in the ideal perovskite structure, the binding energies are 1.020 eV for H2O with FA+, 1.446 eV for H2O with Pb2+, and 1.774 eV for H2O with I−. These results disclose that the degradation of the perovskite can occur due to the hydration of the perovskite by the absorption of water molecules at the sites adjacent to vacancy defects. Thus, eliminating vacancies can be a viable way to diminish the sensitivity of perovskites to moisture.

The right side of Fig. 6a depicts that the utilization of guanabenz acetate salt can remove vacancies through interaction with perovskite. The aromatic amine salt guanabenz acetate contains acetate (AC−) and guanidine groups, where the AC− exhibits robust coordination ability, while a larger number of effective hydrogen bonds can be formed by the terminated guanidine group in the benzene ring when compared to that of FA+. In the FTIR spectra (Fig. 6c), the peaks of C=O and C-O of guanabenz acetate salt with perovskite film exhibit a shift towards a lower wave number when compared to that of guanabenz acetate salt, suggesting the existence of an interaction of guanabenz acetate salt with perovskite. Furthermore, in the high-resolution XPS spectra of Pb 4f (Fig. 6d), the target film affords an obvious downshift when compared to its counterpart, which suggests that the guanabenz acetate salt can bind with the unsaturated Pb2+, thereby eliminating the I− vacancy. If I− vacancies occur, the unsaturated Pb2+ will preferentially bind with AC− by a robust Pb-O bond instead of the water molecule because the binding energy of Pb2+-AC− is −2.401 eV, which is much lower than that of the −0.610 eV for Pb2+-H2O. Furthermore, the energetic stability calculation and generated hydrogen bond suggest that the terminated guanidine group of guanabenz acetate salt can be responsible for the filling of FA+ vacancies. In the high-resolution XPS spectra, the target film exhibits a downshift when compared to that of the control film, which suggests that the AC− is responsible for the filling of the I− vacancy and the generation of a hydrogen bond between the I atom and the terminated guanidine group of guanabenz acetate salt. In the FTIR spectra, the peak of C=N of guanabenz acetate salt with PbI2 film exhibits a shift towards a lower wave number when compared to that of guanabenz acetate salt, suggesting the existence of an interaction of the terminated guanidine group of guanabenz acetate salt with PbI2 film by a hydrogen bond. Additionally, the DFT calculations suggest that the formation of I− vacancy is suppressed by 0.28 eV when FA+ vacancy is filled by the terminated guanidine, and thus a stable perovskite lattice is formed.

A deep energy level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) investigation (Fig. 6e) is performed to validate the elimination of I− and FA+ vacancies by guanabenz acetate salt in perovskite. In the DLTS plot, the control sheet shows two peaks indicated as T1 and T2, suggesting the existence of two kinds of dominant traps. In contrast, the absence of trap peaks is observed in the target film, suggesting the elimination of vacancy after the introduction of guanabenz acetate salt in perovskite. To determine the activation energy of the corresponding traps, the Arrhenius plots have been fitted (Fig. 6f) based on the Arrhenius equation (ln(tau × Vth × Nc) = ((ET − EV)/KT) − ln(XPσP)). The symbols denote the following terms: K: Boltzmann constant; Nc: effective density of states of the trap in cm−3; XP: entropy factor; tau: emission time constant; Vth: thermal velocity; ET: energy level of the trap center; EV: energy level of VBM; σP: capture cross section; T: temperature of the test. The ΔE = ET − EV is the trap activation energy, where the ΔE of T1 is calculated to be 0.51 eV for FA+ vacancy and the ΔE of T2 is calculated to be 0.39 eV for I− vacancy in the control film. The space-charge-limited current investigation further corroborates the DLTS investigation. Furthermore, the target film exhibits higher carrier mobility (2.68 cm2 V−1 s−1) and diffusion length (3.92 μm) when compared to that of the control film (1.98 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.96 μm). Additionally, the effects of the diminished moisture sensitivity of perovskite with guanabenz acetate salt due to the elimination of vacancies are analyzed. The FA+ vacancy is filled by terminated guanidine groups, and the I− vacancy is filled by AC− of guanabenz acetate salt, where the calculated binding energies (Fig. 6g) are 0.790 eV for H2O molecules with FA+, 0.373 eV for H2O molecules with Pb2+, and 0.475 eV for H2O molecules with I−. The binding energies of H2O molecules with the perovskite are negative (Fig. 6b), whereas the binding energies of H2O molecules are positive (Fig. 6g) after the introduction of guanabenz acetate salt, which suggests that the H2O molecules are harder to bind (not spontaneous or immediate) with the perovskite after the introduction of guanabenz acetate salt. Therefore, the perovskite hydration is intercepted due to guanabenz acetate salt, which could guard the crystallization of perovskite from moisture, and thus high-quality perovskite film deposition is obtained in ambient air (Fig. 6a) for the fabrication of efficient PSCs.

The introduction of dry air and a surfactant (potassium oleate) can enable water to act as a green solvent for the fabrication of perovskite. Zhang et al.72 have utilized dry air and a surfactant (potassium oleate), which enables water to act as a green solvent for the fabrication of perovskite, to achieve enhanced performance of PSCs. At first, the crystallization process of Pb(NO3)2 under various relative humidity conditions is investigated. The moisture in the ambient air acts a crucial role in the nucleation rate of Pb(NO3)2 and the spreading dynamics of aqueous inks, where the high surface tension of water can severely deteriorate the morphology of the perovskite film. Hence, the surface tension of water is diminished by using long-alkyl-chain potassium oleate as an anionic surfactant. Therefore, pinhole-free, high-quality, conformal perovskite film with enlarged grain size can be prepared by the synergistic effect of oleate anion and dry air, while potassium oleate modulates the crystallinity of Pb(NO3)2, which can improve the crystallization of PbI2 and enhance the formation kinetics of perovskite. As a result, the PSC exhibits a high PCE of 24.14%, while it exhibits high stability (95.2% retention for 800 h by MPP tracking test).

The introduction of NH4+ as a volatile cation can easily eliminate acetate during annealing for the fabrication of high quality perovskite film in an ambient laboratory environment. Zhao et al.144 have utilized NH4+ as a volatile cation for the facile elimination of acetate during annealing, and thus high-quality formamidinium-caesium mixed-cation perovskite films are prepared using a lead acetate-based precursor formulation by blade-coating in an ambient laboratory environment. As a result, the PSC and module exhibit high PCE of 21% and 18.8% (10 cm2), respectively, while the PSC exhibits high stability (80% retention for 327 h by MPP tracking test (PTAA as HTL)) and high thermal stability (negligible decay for 3300 h at 65 °C).

Utilization of machine learning-guided robotic platforms can enable the fabrication of high quality perovskite in an ambient atmosphere. Zhang et al.145 have demonstrated the SPINBOT (fully automated spin-coating platform) for the engineering of solution-processed functional thin films for high-performance PSCs. Using SPINBOT, experiments can be conducted with high sampling variability, where hundreds of substrates can be processed without supervision with superior experimental control. The Bayesian optimization algorithm can enable the iterative optimization process, and thus an intricate parameter space can be explored by the SPINBOT, which constantly enhances the reproducibility and quality of the prepared thin films. Thus, the exploration of the optimization process of PSCs can be enabled by this machine-learning-guided reliable SPINBOT platform through the facile photoluminescence characterization of thin films. Thus, utilizing a machine-learning-guided, robotic platform, the perovskite thin-film parameter spaces are optimized. As a result, the PSC obtained in an ambient atmosphere exhibits a high PCE of 21.6%, while it exhibits high stability (85% retention for 1570 h by MPP tracking test).

Utilization of aqueous halide-free nanofluids can control the formation kinetics of a perovskite through a grain refinement strategy for the fabrication of green water-processed PSCs. Zhai et al.146 have utilized aqueous halide-free nanofluids to control the formation kinetics of a perovskite through a grain refinement strategy, while in situ UV-Vis absorption and PL measurements are performed to investigate the crystallization process, where anion configurations and the microstructure of PbI2 play a vital role in the formation kinetics. Subsequently, the reaction rate is promoted to ∼30% by using PbCO3 nanofluids with an inert CO32− (carbonate anion), where the formation of FA vacancy defects is efficiently hindered by CO32− at the surface of a FA-based perovskite. As a result, the green water-processed PSC obtained in dry-air atmosphere exhibits a high PCE of 23.64% while it exhibits high stability.

Strategies for using ambient conditions and/or water for the fabrication of PSCs, including the utilization of guanabenz acetate salt71, dry air and surfactant (potassium oleate)72, NH4+ as a volatile cation for the facile elimination of acetate during annealing144, machine learning-guided robotic platforms145, and aqueous halide-free nanofluids146, enhanced the efficiency and/or stability of the PSCs.

Flexible/bifacial PSCs

Developing flexible PSCs with high performance is highly desirable for the application of wearable electronics, intelligent vehicles, uncrewed aerial vehicles, and building-integrated photovoltaics76,147. Utilization of molecular dipole engineering strategy can release the strain for the fabrication of mechanically strong and flexible PSCs. Xie et al.76 have fabricated mechanically strong and flexible PSCs by using molecular dipole engineering strategy to release the strain. 1F-2CN, 2F-2CN, and 3F-2CN are among the -CN additives with different molecular dipoles that are created (1F-2CN: 2’-fluoro-[1,1’-biphenyl]-3,5-dicarbonitrile; 2F-2CN: 2’,6’-difluoro-[1,1’-biphenyl]-3,5-dicarbonitrile; 3F-2CN: 2’,3’,4’-trifluoro-[1,1’-biphenyl]-3,5-dicarbonitrile). Two -CN groups in the additives may coordinate the Pb2+ defects, and the F (fluorine) atoms may control the dipole moment of the additives by forming hydrogen bonds with the charged FA+ group. Additionally, the -CN additions may stitch the flaws at the grain boundaries and relieve the stress at the grain boundary, resulting in a lower Young’s modulus and greater mechanical flexibility. Furthermore, the additions may improve carrier extraction and transport while attenuating the interactions between the longitudinal optical phonons and the charge carriers. When compared to PSC with 1F-2CN and PSC with 3F-2CN, the flexible PSC with the 2F-2CN addition shows superior efficiency and stability due to its stronger molecular dipole. Thus, the PSC containing the 2F-2CN addition shows a high PCE of 24.08% (Table 6), strong stability (retention of 94% for 620 h by MPP tracking test), and excellent bending cycle stability for flexible solar cells (92% retention for 3000 bending cycles).

The utilization of halide-substituted ammonium salts can optimize the buried interface and the perovskite crystallization, eliminate the nanovoids at the interface for the fabrication of flexible PSCs on flexible plastic substrates. An et al.148 have utilized halide-substituted ammonium salts to optimize the buried interface and the perovskite crystallization to enhance the performance of flexible PSCs, where the halide-substituted ammonium salts are n-bromophenethylammonium (n-Br-PEAX; n = 2 or 4; X = Cl or Br). The speed of the crystallization process of perovskite can be altered by the rational design molecular structure of the ammonium salt, thereby generating a dense and homogenous morphology where nanovoids are absent at the interface. Hence, the PSC exhibits a high PCE of 20.2% on flexible plastic substrates, while it exhibits high stability (87% retention for 290 h by MPP tracking test).

The utilization of in situ crosslinking-assisted perovskite grain growth strategy can enable the fabrication of mechanically robust flexible PSCs with high efficiency. Wu et al.149 have demonstrated mechanically robust flexible PSCs with high efficiency through in situ crosslinking-assisted perovskite grain growth. The bis((3-methyloxetan-3-yl) methyl) thiophene-2,5-dicarboxylate (OETC) monomer is designed for regulating the growth of perovskite on plastic substrates. Thus, a perovskite film with a preferential crystal orientation, compact stacking, and enlarged grain size is obtained. Additionally, the mechanical stress can be effectively removed by the crosslinked elastomer polymer accumulated at the grain boundaries of the perovskite. Thus, after 2000 bending cycles (Radius: 5 mm), the SEM image of perovskite-crosslinking OETC film exhibits negligible fracture (Fig. 7c), but the SEM image of perovskite-MOTC film exhibits noticeable fracture (Fig. 7b), whereas the SEM image of pristine perovskite film exhibits severe fracture (Fig. 7a), suggesting the crosslinking OETC affords robust deformation stability, while the MOTC affords a partial deformation stability, but the pristine perovskite possesses poor deformation stability (MOTC: bis(3-methoxypropyl) thiophene-2,5-dicarboxylate). As a result, the PSC with crosslinking OETC exhibits high bending cycle stability for flexible solar cells (93% retention for 5000 bending cycles (Fig. 7d)), and the PSC with crosslinking OETC exhibits high PCE of 23.4%, while it exhibits high stability.

Bifacial PSCs can harvest more solar illumination through two sides (front and rear surfaces; additional energy can be added through albedo light) than the one-side light harvesting of the monofacial PSCs, and that can enhance the energy conversion efficiency of the bifacial PSCs. Nevertheless, the design of the bifacial PSCs with high PCE and stability is a challenging task because of electrode corrosion and electrical loss in transparent rear contact, ion migration, and high rear side carrier recombination, while the components (such as the back contact electrode, perovskite layer, and transport layer) of the bifacial solar cells (making these as semi-transparent PSCs) need to be transparent to achieve high performance150,151. Thus, Jiang et al.77 have fabricated a transparent conducting rear electrode for bifacial single-junction PSCs (Fig. 7e) with inverted architecture using optical and electrical modeling to achieve high efficiency at different albedo illumination conditions. They have demonstrated that the bifacial PSCs have the capability to surpass their monofacial PSCs in terms of a lower levelized cost of energy and larger energy yields. As a result, the single-junction bifacial PSC exhibits a high PCE of 31.2% at an albedo of 0.5 (Fig. 7f), and the stabilized bifacial power output densities are 26.9 mW/cm2 under an albedo of 0.2, 28.5 mW/cm2 under albedo of 0.3, and 30.1 mW/cm2 under an albedo of 0.5 (Fig. 7g), while the bifacial PSCs exhibit the bifaciality of about 91% to 93%.

Various strategies for flexible PSCs, including molecular dipole engineering-assisted strain release76, utilization of halide-substituted ammonium salts148, and in situ crosslinking-assisted perovskite grain growth149, enhanced the efficiency and/or stability of the PSCs. Fabrication of a transparent conducting rear electrode77 enhanced the efficiency and/or stability of the bifacial PSCs.

Additive strategies for PSCs

Utilizing ammonium cations with a high pKa value of 12 as an additive can inhibit the deprotonation process when they react with FA+ in the perovskites at high-temperatures light soaking, and that can enhance the efficiency and stability of the PSCs at high-temperatures. Wang et al.63 have observed that the extensively used organic cations such as butylammonium (BA+) and phenethylammonium (PEA+) for 2D perovskites are unstable in formamidinium (FA+)-containing perovskites in light soaking at high-temperature. The BA+ and PEA+ deprotonate into amines at high-temperature light soaking, which subsequently react rapidly with FA+ to generate (butylamino)methaniminium (BAMA+) and (phenethylamino)methaniminium (PEAMA+), respectively. As a result, ammonia is produced, which generates damage to grain boundaries and perovskite interfaces and hampers the photostability of the PSCs at high-temperatures. Therefore, the photostability of the PSCs at high-temperatures can be enhanced by either removing BA+ and PEA+ cations from precursors or utilizing ammonium cations with high pKa (12.0), including BAMA+ and PEAMA+, because of the difficulty in deprotonation. Thus, the PSC exhibits a high PCE of 24.1% (Tables 7), while it exhibits high stability (90% retention at 85 °C for ~1500 h) by MPP tracking test.

The cation compositional inhomogeneity exhibited due to A-site cation segregation can hamper the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs with FA1-xCsxPbI3. The utilization of a suitable additive with a sulfone group can cause cation compositional homogeneity, and that could enhance the performance of PSCs. Liang et al.80 have identified the cause of the compositional inhomogeneity outside of the plane and its significant impact on PSCs. They envision this occurring along the vertical direction throughout perovskite films, where Cs aggregation is observed, preferably at the bottom of the film (Fig. 8a). Furthermore, the addition of 1-(phenylsulfonyl)pyrrole (PSP; Fig. 8b) with a sulfone group homogenizes the distribution of cation content in perovskite films. As a result, the PSC shows a high PCE of 26.09% and a good level of stability (92% retention for 2500 h) according to the MPP tracking test. In situ synchrotron radiation grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) is conducted to determine the dual essential kinetic processes of phase transition and crystallization during the formation of perovskite. As shown in Fig. 8c, signals for a q vector of about 0.8 Å−1 can be ascribed to δ-phase perovskite of 2H (100), at about 0.82 Å−1 can be attributed to δ-phase perovskite of 6H (101), and 1.0 Å−1 can be assigned to α-phase perovskite. Two periods can be defined to investigate the kinetic processes. Period I is ascribed until the appearance of α-phase perovskite from the dripping of chlorobenzene (CB), where the crystallization rate is indicated by the duration of period I. Period II indicates the transition rate of δ- to α-phase, signifying the duration of stable α-phase formation. Thus, the in situ GIWAXS results disclose that both the phase transition and crystallization are accelerated by the introduction of PSP. The ‘out-of-plane cation inhomogeneity’ studies and in situ GIWAXS results disclose that the segregation of the Cs and FA phases can be efficiently inhibited by the PSP, where the slow rate of phase transition and crystallization are the potential kinetic factors leading to segregation of phase. The barrier energy (EB) for the perovskite phase change and crystallization is calculated thermodynamically using DFT calculations (DFT: Density functional theory), and the energy is then divided into the contributions from the Cs and FA components. The ΔEB = EBFA - EBCs defines the change in barrier energies. The mismatch factor μ = (EBFA - EBCs)/EBFA is calculated to determine more precisely the imbalance between the Cs and FA components. During period I, the ΔEB,I ref is 101.6 meV for the reference system (Fig. 8d), whereas the ΔEB,I PSP is only 35.3 meV for the PSP system (Fig. 8e), while the corresponding μ values are calculated to be 20.48% for μI,ref and only 5.34% for μI,PSP. At period II, ΔEB,II ref is 82 meV with μref is 12.49% for the reference system, but ΔEB,II PSP is only −6 meV with μPSP is only −1.79% for the PSP system. Thus, the PSP system exhibits lower μI and μII, which disclose that the variations in the phase transition and crystallization rates of the Cs and FA components are diminished, where the differences in the cations rates are possibly attributed to the observed delay through in situ GIWAXS. The potential reason for cation inhomogeneity may be attributed to the soft base characteristic of Cs cations compared to FA cations. This difference could lead to stronger interactions with PbI3−, resulting in a tendency for Cs to aggregate preferentially at the bottom. Moreover, the variation in the solubilities of FA and Cs species could partially be ascribed to inhomogeneity of cations.

Through extended X-ray absorption fine spectroscopy (EXAFS), the adsorption spectra of the Pb LIII edge are obtained to determine the interactions of PSP with perovskite. A total of five grazing incidence angles are chosen in order to collect data at various perovskite film depths. The peaks at radial distances of about 2.2 Å and 2.9 Å, respectively, can be attributed to Pb-O and Pb-I coordination, as seen in Fig. 8f, g. A gradual downward shift of about 0.03 Å for the coordination of Pb-I is seen for the reference film (Fig. 8f) as the detecting depth is increased, suggesting that the lattice at the bottom of the perovskite has compressed. Nonetheless, the comparatively steady peaks linked to Pb-I coordination are detected subsequently to the addition of PSP, indicating the existence of cation inhomogeneity outside of the plane. When the depth is increased, an obvious shift in the higher radial distance for the Pb-O coordination is observed for the PSP film (Fig. 8g), suggesting the formation of a higher Pb-O coordination near the bottom of the film. Calculating the Pb-O coordination ratio of (Pb-O)/((Pb-O) + (Pb-I)) (Fig. 8h) reveals that Pb atoms in the PSP system typically coordinate with extra oxygen atoms toward the bottom of the perovskite film. Thus, it is hypothesized that there is a possible interaction between PSP and Pb atoms in perovskite due to the donation of electrons from the two oxygen atoms of the PSP.

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements are performed on the as-synthesized (PbI2)x(PSP)y complex crystals to exactly determine the interaction of PSP with PbI2, where the peak at about 1328 cm−1 corresponds to asymmetric stretching vibration (νas), 1133 cm−1 corresponds to symmetric stretching vibration (νs) of the sulfone (O = S = O) group, and 964 cm−1 corresponds to symmetric stretching vibration (νs) of the sulfoxide (S = O) group. Moreover, all three characteristic peaks exhibit obvious shifts, suggesting the coordination between PSP and PbI2 by the sulfone (O = S = O) group (Fig. 8i). The νas and νs peaks exhibit upward shifts, which suggest that both oxygen atoms of the PSP can act as active sites, while the coordination between the O = S = O group and PbI2 is further confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra, where the shifts in the carbon atoms nearby to the O = S = O group (nos. 14, 11, 6, 2, and 1) to a higher field are observed. These results corroborate the peak shifts detected through XPS measurements and the diminished PbI2 signal obtained through in situ GIWAXS tests.

Utilization of a suitable Lewis base additive can enhance the crystallinity and diminish the defect density and internal residual stress of the perovskite bulk, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. The quality of the bulk and surface of the FA0.98Cs0.02PbI3 perovskite film was improved by Chen et al.152 to diminish the efficiency gap. At first, a Lewis base additive (dibutyl sulfoxide) is used to enhance the crystallinity and diminish the defect density and internal residual stress of the perovskite bulk. Finally, the surface of the perovskite film is treated with trifluorocarbon-modified phenethylammonium iodide to optimize the energy levels and protect the film from moisture and passivate defects. Thus, the PSC exhibits a high PCE of 25.1%, while it exhibits high stability (97.4% retention for 1800 h) according to the MPP tracking test.

The introduction of a non-volatile, multifunctional additive can alter the kinetics of the growth of the perovskite film via a hydrogen-bond-bridged intermediate phase, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Li et al.153 have utilized a non-volatile, multifunctional additive to alter the kinetics of the growth of the perovskite film via a hydrogen-bond-bridged intermediate phase. Thus, coherent grain growth and the generation of large perovskite grains from the bottom to the surface of the perovskite film are achieved, leading to considerably diminished non-radiative recombinations. As a result, the PSC exhibits a high PCE of 24.8% and a low energy loss of 0.36 eV, while it exhibits high stability (90% retention for 500 h) by MPP tracking test, while the unencapsulated devices afford enhanced thermal stability with a T98 lifetime for >1000 h in a nitrogen-filled glovebox under constant heating at 65 ± 5 °C.

The introduction of dimethylammonium chloride as an additive can modulate the perovskite intermediate precursor phases, which can modulate the grain size, orientation, crystallinity, and texturing of the perovskite system, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. McMeekin et al.154 utilized dimethylammonium chloride as an additive to modulate the perovskite intermediate precursor phases through a high-temperature dimethyl-sulfoxide-free processing route. Thus, the grain size, orientation (corner-up versus face-up), crystallinity, and texturing of the (FA)yCs1–yPb(IxBr1–x)3 perovskite system are modulated through controlling the sequence of crystallization. Hence, the PSC exhibits an unexpected PCE of 20.2% while it exhibits high stability (it exhibits 80% retention for 1190 h for steady-state power conversion efficiency and 80% retention for 1410 h at open-circuit conditions in air under simulated sunlight at 65 °C).

Excess lead iodide (PbI2) and abundant defects are commonly observed in perovskite films, where the PbI2 species can exhibit either a positive or negative effect on the PCE of the PSCs. The PbI2 layer with an ordered array structure can be obtained by integrating a suitable additive with nanoimprinting technology, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. He et al.155 have integrated a succinamide additive with nanoimprinting technology for the fabrication of a porous PbI2 layer with an ordered array structure. Thus, organic amine salts can be confined in PbI2 arrays to enhance omnidirectional diffusion and realize adequate conversion to perovskites. As a result, the PSC exhibits a high PCE of 23.56% and high stability, while the module (14.63 cm2) exhibits a PCE of 16.42%.

The introduction of more hydrophobic π-conjugated aromatic additives can enhance the passivation and decrease the recombination, which can improve the stability and PCE of PSCs. Wang et al.156 have demonstrated the role of π-conjugated aromatic additives (CAAs) such as coumarin methacrylate (CMA) and coumarin hydroxyethyl (CHE) on the stability and PCE of PSCs using Cs0.05(FA0.85MA0.15)0.95Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 perovskite. The additives are added to the precursor perovskite solutions, where CMA is more hydrophobic than CHE. Thus, the extent of passivation and binding to Pb2+ increase with an increase in hydrophobicity, leading to a decrease in recombination. As a result, the PSC with CMA exhibits a superior PCE of 21.28% than that of CHE (21.14%), while it exhibits high stability (including moisture and thermal stability).

The introduction of Zn(C6F5)2 as a molecular additive, and the utilization of dopant-free hole transport layer can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Mali et al.157 have demonstrated β–CsPbI3-Zn(C6F5)2 and γ–CsPbI3-GAI based phase-heterojunction all-inorganic PSC (n-i-p type) with high efficiency, where the β–CsPbI3-Zn(C6F5)2 was obtained by hot-air-processed and dimethylammonium iodide-assisted method, while the γ–CsPbI3-GAI was obtained by triple-source thermally evaporated method (GAI: guanidinium iodide). The Zn(C6F5)2 is used as a molecular additive, while the dopant-free hole transport layer is utilized. Therefore, the β − γ-based phase-heterojunction PSC and module exhibit enhanced PCE of 21.59% and 18.43% (18.08 cm2), respectively, while the PSC exhibits high stability (~90% retention for 200 h by MPP tracking test).

Utilization of hydrophobic additive with the hole transport layer can enhance the moisture resistance of the perovskite films, while integration of silica nanoparticles with suitable size and spacing with the perovskite films can retrieve the absorption loss induced by the lack of reflective metal electrodes, and that can enhance the performance of the bifacial perovskite minimodules. It has been shown by Gu et al.158 that the bifacial perovskite minimodules can add additional energy through albedo light, and their front efficiency is comparable to that of their opaque monofacial counterparts. A hydrophobic additive is introduced with the hole transport layer to enhance the moisture resistance of the perovskite films, while silica nanoparticles with suitable size and spacing are integrated with the perovskite films to retrieve the absorption loss induced by the lack of reflective metal electrodes. Under 1 solar illumination and 0.2 albedo, the small-area single-junction bifacial PSCs show a power-generation density of 26.4 mW cm−2. As a result, the PSC exhibits a high PCE of 23.19% while it exhibits high stability. The bifacial minimodules exhibit >20% front efficiency, 74.3% bifaciality, and >23 mW cm−2 of power-generation density at an albedo of 0.2. The bifacial minimodule exhibits high stability (97% retention for >6000 h after light soaking under 1 sun at 60 ± 5 °C).

Utilization of suitable alkylthiol additive with the hole transport material can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Liu et al.159 have demonstrated a facile approach to introducing the 1-dodecanethiol (DDT, a low-cost alkylthiol additive) in the hole transport material (spiro-OMeTAD: 2,20,7,70-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)-9,90-spiro bifluorene). Thus, a controllable, efficient doping process with efficient doping duration is achieved due to the DDT, which can provide comparable performance for hole transport material before air activation. The coordination of DDT with a lithium compound (LiTFSI) elevates the concentration of dopants in the bulk hole transport material, diminishes their accumulation at interfaces, and improves the structural integrity of the hole transport material at heat, wetting, and light stress. Consequently, the PSC demonstrates substantial power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.6% and maintains robust stability, retaining 90% of its performance after 1000 h as verified by the maximum power point (MPP) tracking test.

The utilization of suitable additives, including additives with a sulfone group for perovskite80, Lewis base additives for perovskite152, a non-volatile, multifunctional additive for perovskite153, dimethylammonium chloride as an additive for perovskite154, the integration of succinamide additives with a nanoimprinting technology for perovskite155, π-conjugated aromatic additives for perovskite156, Zn(C6F5)2 as a molecular additive157, and the introduction of 1-dodecanethiol as an alkylthiol additive with the hole transport material159 enhanced the efficiency and/or stability of the PSCs.

Strategies associated with buried interfaces for PSCs

The main obstacles hindering the photovoltaic stability and performance of inverted PSCs are photochemical degradation and non-radiative recombination losses (trap-assisted) at the perovskite and charge-transport layers interface. Introduction of suitable additive into the precursor inks can tune the crystallization of perovskite, regulate the extraction dynamics and carrier recombination at the buried interface, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Li et al.64 have introduced a tiny quantity of 2-aminoindan hydrochloride into the precursor inks to tune the crystallization of methylammonium-free perovskite. Thus, the additive regulates the extraction dynamics and carrier recombination at the buried interface through the generation of a bottom-up 2D/3D heterojunction (Fig. 9a, b). The PSC achieves a notable PCE of 25.12% overall (Fig. 9a, b) and a certified PCE of 24.60%, surpassing previously reported values for similar MA-free inverted PSCs (Fig. 9c). It maintains over 98% of its performance after 1500 h, as verified by MPP tracking tests (Table 8 and Fig. 9e).

Introduction of an amphiphilic molecular hole transporter with multifunctional group can produce a superwetting underlayer for the deposition of perovskite, and that can cause the formation of high-quality perovskite films with the fewest defects at the buried interface. Zhang et al.81 have demonstrated the (2-(4-(bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino)phenyl)-1-cyanovinyl)phosphonic acid (MPACPA) containing a multifunctional cyanovinyl phosphonic acid group as an amphiphilic molecular hole transporter. This generates a superwetting underlayer for the deposition of perovskite, and that causes the formation of high-quality perovskite films with the fewest defects at the buried interface. As a result, the perovskite film exhibits 17% of photoluminescence quantum yield and about 7 microseconds of Shockley-Read-Hall lifetime, and the perovskite solar cell and minimodule exhibit high PCE of 25.16% (23.4% for 1 cm2) and 22.0% (10 cm2), respectively. The PSC exhibits robust stability (>90% retention for 2000 h) by MPP tracking test due to the encapsulated modules afford high stability at damp heat and operational test conditions. Electronic structure calculations by first-principles are conducted to determine the effect of passivation of MPACPA on typical deep-level defects generated on the surface of the perovskite grain, including lead-iodide antisite (PbI) and interstitial lead (Pbi) defects. Deep defective states are induced by Pbi and PbI within the band gap, and that could play as non-radiative recombination centers. The introduction of the MPACPA molecule significantly passivates the defective states of PbI and Pbi, causing them to migrate either within the conduction or valence bands or close to the band edges, as shown in Fig. 10b. Emerging chemical bonds were generated between N and Pb from the cyano group (Pb-N’) and between O and Pb from the phosphonic acid group (Pb-O’), as shown in Fig. 10a, leading to the formation of a complemented octahedral local chemical environment for Pb. The Pb-N’ bond length is calculated to be 2.47 Å, which is less than that of the experimentally determined Pb-N bond lengths (~2.58 to 2.75 Å) in lead acesulfamates, whereas the calculated Pb-O’ bond length of 2.68 Å is within the experimentally determined limit of ~2.484 to 2.914 Å. The calculated electron localization function results further confirm the chemical bond formation between Pb and O’ and N’ (Fig. 10c).

The synergistic effect of passivation through two types of bonds significantly enhances the thermodynamic stability of passivation sites, proving especially effective at mitigating deep-level defect states. As a result, the perovskite film on MPACPA exhibits 17% of the photoluminescence quantum yield in the half-stacks due to the decrease in non-radiative recombination at the buried interface. The XPS studies further confirm the interaction of CPA with Pb. The thermal admittance spectroscopy studies disclose the frequency dependent capacitance in PSCs with various hole transport layers. The MPACPA-based PSCs afford a lower apparent trap density of states (tDOS) at about 0.4 eV (Fig. 10d), which could be attributed to the lesser number of ionic charges or the reduction of electronic defects in perovskite.

Introduction of MACl as an additive can afford void-free perovskite-buried interface for scalable processing of perovskite solar modules. Hu et al.160 have demonstrated a void-free perovskite-buried interface for scalable processing of p-i-n-based perovskite solar modules (>10 cm2) with FAPbI3 as perovskite. The growth of the perovskite film is controlled by utilizing a moderate flow of N2 during vacuum-assisted growth, while the utilization of MACl as an additive hinders interfacial voids in blade-coated large-area perovskites. As a result, the PSC exhibits a high PCE of 22.3%, while it exhibits high stability, while the scalable perovskite solar module with 12.25 cm2 of aperture area exhibits a high PCE of 18.3% with a geometric fill factor of 96.3%.

The utilization of interfacial ligand confinement strategy can provide top-contact passivation and improve the extraction of electrons at the electron selective contact, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Huang etal.161 have demonstrated the fabrication of finite 2D/3D hierarchical perovskite structures through interfacial ligand confinement to enhance the stability and efficiency of the inverted PSCs and modules. The generation of a finite and dense 2D layer is achieved due to the utilization of a diamine masking reagent atop the 3D perovskite layer, which can modulate cation exchange through hydrogen bonding, while this can provide top-contact passivation and improve the extraction of electrons at the electron selective contact. Hence, the PSC exhibits a remarkable PCE of 24.7% with high stability (>90% retention for 1000 h) according to the MPP tracking test.

The utilization of suitable amphoteric organic salt can modulate the energy level alignment and film morphology at the perovskite buried interface. Zhang et al.162 have utilized 2-(4-fluorophenyl)ethylammonium-4-methyl benzenesulfonate (4FPEAPSA) to modulate the energy level alignment and film morphology at the perovskite buried interface. The amphoteric organic 4FPEAPSA salt treatment enhances the growth of a coarse-grained, void-free, and hydrophobic film by inducing crystal orientation. Thus, the 4FPEAPSA with dual functionality can interact chemically with the perovskite film to passivate the formamidine vacancies and defects of iodine, returning the fermi level of perovskite to its defect-free state. Moreover, the interfacial charge extraction and transport of PSC can be enhanced by the generation of a p-type doping buried interface to attain diminished carrier recombination loss. This PSC exhibits a large PCE of 25.03% while it exhibits high stability.

Utilization of conductive and transparent oxide perovskite as ETL can afford high lattice matching, and obviate the generation of a deteriorated buried interface, which can provide less strain, less defects, high crystallinity, fewer voids, and suppress ion migration, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Luo et al.163 have utilized the SrSnO3 perovskite as ETL rather than using a passivator, where the SrSnO3 is a conductive and transparent oxide perovskite. Thus, a well-ordered beginning of the growth of perovskite on the ETL is achieved due to the high lattice matching, hindering the generation of a deteriorated buried interface. Hence, the buried interface affords reduced strain, less defects, high crystallinity, fewer voids, and suppressed ion migration. Consequently, the PSC exhibits an excellent PCE of 25.17%, and retain high stability (90% retention for 1000 h) according to the MPP tracking test.

Utilization of suitable surfactant on the surface of the TiO2 can diminish surface energy, enhance the carrier-extraction efficiency, relieve the compressive stresses at the buried interface, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Su et al.164 have utilized heptadecafluorooctanesulfonate tetraethylammonium (HFSTA) as a surfactant on the surface of the TiO2. The DFT calculations reveal that the generation of O vacancies is inhibited on HFSTA-TiO2, and that can diminish surface energy and enhance the carrier-extraction efficiency. The experimental studies disclose that the enhanced crystallization process and diminished heterogeneous nucleation sites enable the generation of good-quality perovskite films, while the compressive stresses at the buried interface are significantly relieved by the flexible long alkyl chains in HFSTA. Thus, the PSC exhibits a high PCE of 25.03% due to the passivation of TiO2, stress relief, and modulation in the crystallization process, while it exhibits high stability (66% retention for 50 h) by MPP tracking test.

Utilization of a pre-embedding mixed A-cation halide strategy can enable the formation of the high-stable 3D perovskite from the residual unstable PbI2 near the buried interface, optimize the lattice strain of the perovskite near the buried interface, inhibit the detrimental δ phase formation from the α phase, and enhance the phase stability of the perovskite. Gao et al.165 have improved the stability of the PSC through utilizing a pre-embedding mixed A-cation halide strategy, where the high-stable 3D perovskite is formed from the residual unstable PbI2 near the buried interface. Thus, this strategy could optimize the lattice strain of the perovskite near the buried interface, inhibit the detrimental δ phase formation from the α phase, and enhance the phase stability of the perovskite. As a result, the PSC exhibits a high PCE of 24.26%, while it exhibits high stability (94.7% retention for 1000 h) by MPP tracking test.

Strategies associated with buried interfaces including the utilization of suitable additives64,160, amphiphilic molecular hole transporter81, amphoteric organic salt162, conductive and transparent oxide perovskite as ETL163, suitable surfactant on the surface of the TiO2164, interfacial ligand confinement161, and a pre-embedding mixed A-cation halide strategy165, enhanced the efficiency and/or stability of the PSCs.

Strategies for ion migration for PSCs

Various strategies have been performed to retard the ion migration to enhance the performance of PSCs. Utilization of suitable material as iodine trapper can alleviate the ion migration, and that can enhance the stability of PSCs. Li et al.70 have utilized β-cyclodextrin as an iodine trapper to enhance the stability of PSCs. The iodine formed in perovskite can be trapped by β-cyclodextrin, and the bowl structure of β-cyclodextrin hinders the escape of iodine, where the trapped I2 can react with and consume Pb0 defects in perovskite films, further enhancing the stability of PSCs. Therefore, the PSC exhibits a high PCE of 23.2%, while it exhibits high stability (∼90% retention for 1000 h (Table 9) under ISOSL-1 by MPP tracking test at 25 °C; ∼81.2% retention for 300 h under ISOSL-2 by MPP tracking test at 85 °C, where ISOS represents International summit on organic photovoltaic stability).

Substitution of lead with tin in perovskite can suppress the ionic transport, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Dey et al.166 have demonstrated that ionic transport is suppressed in halide perovskite optoelectronics due to the substitution of lead with tin. The scan-rate-dependent current-voltage investigations on mixed Pb-Sn and Pb PSCs disclose losses for short-circuit current at lesser scan rates in both kinds of perovskites, which can be traced to the existence of mobile ions. Temperature-dependent impedance spectroscopy measurements and scan-rate-dependent hysteresis analyses reveal that the ion migration in Pb-Sn PSCs is suppressed when compared to that of Pb perovskite solar cells. As shown in Fig. 11a–c, three distinct pathways for iodide ion migration are examined, which are labeled as A, B, and C, while the Fig. 11d depicts their corresponding energy profiles. The A, B, and C pathways for FAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 and FASnI3 exhibit various orders of equatorial-axial type hops, where >0.9 eV of energy barriers for both perovskites and 1.45 eV for FAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 and 1.12 eV for FASnI3 of rate-limiting ion migration energies for long-range diffusion are obtained. Thus, the simulations obviously suggest that the iodide migration adjacent to Sn vacancy defects in FASnI3 and FAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 exhibits higher energy barriers of >1.1 eV when compared to that of Pb perovskites with <0.5 eV because of the severe local structural distortion of Sn vacancies, thereby diminishing halide ion mobility. The theoretical calculations and experimental investigations disclose that the Sn vacancies with local structural distortions in mixed Pb-Sn perovskite play a vital role in increasing the suppression of iodide ion migration.

Utilization of a supermolecule as a buffer layer at the interface of perovskite can enhance defect self-healing and inhibit ion migration, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Zhang et al.167 have utilized a supermolecule (starch-polyiodide) as a buffer layer at the interface of perovskite, and this bifunctional buffer layer can enhance defect self-healing and inhibit ion migration. Hence, the metastable dynamics of degradation in perovskites can be tuned by the supramolecular chemistry. Therefore, the PSC exhibits a high PCE of 24.3%, and it exhibits high stability (92% retention for 1472 h by MPP tracking test; 98% retention for 42 diurnal cycles (12 h light/12 h dark cycle), while it exhibits intense electroluminescence with high external quantum efficiencies (>12%).

Introduction of suitable alkali metals can effectively control the ionic migration due to an electrostatic interaction with the organic compounds, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Aranda et al.168 have demonstrated the control of ionic migration in PSCs by alkali metals. Thus, the role of Na, Li, and K on the photovoltage of the MAPbBr3 (wide band-gap perovskite) is systematically examined by utilizing negative capacitance in impedance spectroscopy as a tool. Sodium cations inhibit adverse interfacial recombination pathways, and it exhibits a higher stabilized VOC of 1.65 V when compared to that of Li and K. Impedance studies disclose that the sodium substantially affects the material’s bulk, which is corroborated with the XPS and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry studies. These investigations reveal that the ionic migration is effectively diminished by Na in perovskite materials. The XPS studies disclose that Na effectively decreases the ionic migration in perovskite materials due to an electrostatic interaction with the organic compounds.

Utilization of bis-diazirine molecules can suppress the ionic migration due to the covalent bond formation with the organic cations of perovskites, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Liu et al.169 have utilized bis-diazirine molecules, where the organic cations of perovskites can be covalently bonded with bis-diazirine molecules to alleviate the escape of organic components from perovskites, and that can hinder adverse effects including more defects, organic vapors, and ion migration. Ab initio simulation and experimental investigations disclose that the bis-diazirine molecules effectively immobilize the organic cations, leading to an improvement in the illumination, thermal, and electrical bias resistance properties of perovskites. Hence, the PSC exhibits a large PCE of 23.95%, while it exhibits high stability (98.6% retention for 1000 h by MPP tracking test).

Introduction of a conformally bonded molecular interface can mitigate iodine migration and enhance the performance of PSCs. Yuan et al.170 have utilized a conformally bonded molecular interface to mitigate iodine migration and enhance the performance of PSCs. Thus, three linear molecules (L1, L2, and L3) with a D-A-D’-A-D structure as dopant-free HTMs are obtained by enlarging the indacenodithiophene π-bridge donor (D’) to merge with the benzothiadiazole acceptor (A) and methoxy triphenylamine donor (D). The intermolecular packing effect and intramolecular dipole effect are leveraged by the π-bridge extension with active sites for coordination, leading to a conformally bonded ultrathin interface with uniform and compact coverage (about 60 nm) to guard the buried perovskite and hinder iodine migration. Ultrafast laser spectroscopy investigations disclose that L-series molecules possess a sequential decline of photoexcited energy disorder to demonstrate the structure-performance-stability relationship. Hence, the n-i-p PSC with L3 (ITO/SnO2/perovskite/L3/MoO3/Au) exhibits a high PCE of 22.61%, while it exhibits high stability (>85% retention for 500 h at 85 °C by MPP tracking test).

Incorporating a cross-linked polymer between 2D and 3D perovskite can reduce the ionic diffusion, and that can enhance the performance of the PSCs. Luo et al.82 have designed a 3D perovskite/cross-linked polymer/2D perovskite heterostructure to reduce the ionic diffusion between the surface 2D and bulk 3D perovskites by adding a cross-linked polymer to the top of a 3D perovskite layer and then depositing a 2D perovskite layer using a vapor-assisted two-step process. The heterostructure is sustained by the cross-linked polymer by delaying the diffusion of FA+ and 4F-PEA+ cations across the 2D and 3D perovskites, according to thickness-profiled elemental analysis and photoluminescence spectra (FA+: formamidinium; 4F-PEA+: 4-fluorophenylethylammonium). Consequently, the PSC has a high PCE of 21.2% and great stability (retention of 90% for 4390 h at 60 °C according to the MPP tracking test).

Strategies to retard ion migration, including the utilization of β-cyclodextrin as an iodine trapper70, a buffer layer (a starch-polyiodide supermolecule) at the perovskite interface167, alkali metals168, bis-diazirine molecules169, a conformally bonded molecular interface170, incorporating a cross-linked polymer between 2D and 3D perovskite82, and substitution of lead with tin in perovskite166 enhanced the efficiency and/or stability of the PSCs.

HTL and ETL-related strategies for PSCs

Since the design of (opto)electronic devices resistant to heat is highly desirable, the formation of stable and compact semiconducting thin films is required. Nevertheless, developing solution-processable organic semiconductors with superior thermo-mechanical properties is a highly challenging task. Fang et al.65 have demonstrated that the organic semiconductors (obtained through solution-processable route) exhibit significantly high glass transition temperatures (>220 °C), which could be due to the selection of tribenzotriazatruxene with helical isomer instead of planar isomer as the conjugated core. Microscopic studies disclose that the integration of a non-planar helicene as the conjugated core with organic semiconductors can be solution processed into integral thin films and morphologically homogenous on several substrates, due to a remarkably enhanced solubility of >200 mg mL−1. Furthermore, the theoretical and experimental studies disclose that the helical tribenzotriazatruxene-based organic semiconductor exhibits considerably high water resistance and hole conduction, possibly due to the heightened molecular packing density. As a result, the n-i-p type PSC exhibits a high PCE of 23.9% (Table 10), and high stability (93% retention for 500 h) by MPP tracking test, and high long-term thermal stability at 85 °C.

Utilization of suitable spirobifluorene-based hole transport material containing an electron-donor can afford high glass transition temperature, and provide comparable HOMO energy level, and that can enhance the thermal stability and performance of the PSCs. Ren et al.171 have fabricated a spirobifluorene-based hole transport material containing an electron-donor of extremely asymmetric fluorenylcarbazolamine (SBF-FC) to achieve high thermal stability and efficiency in PSC. Thus, the SBF-FC exhibits a very high glass transition temperature, while it exhibits a comparable HOMO energy level when compared to that of spiro-OMeTAD. A composite is prepared by blending an 85:15 weight ratio of SBF-FC and 4-tertbutylpyridinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide, while the composite exhibits a high conductivity of 49 mS cm−1 at room temperature and retains a high glass transition temperature of 176 °C. Furthermore, the PSC with SBF-FC based hole transport layer on a FAPbI3 thin perovski",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs44296-025-00073-9/MediaObjects/44296_2025_73_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2025-09-06 06:59:28.072077

But Porsche has never done a front-biased all-wheel drive system in its nearly 40-year history of selling all-wheel drive cars.","Porsche is scrambling. Going fully electric with the Macan was a bold decision that came at the wrong time, as luxury EV demand faltered in the US and Europe, and Porsche sales essentially collapsed in China. Porsche won’t revive the gas-powered Macan, sadly, but the company is making a successor—and it's trying to do so cheaply and quickly.

Autocar reports that this new gas-powered SUV, codenamed ""M1,"" will be a twin to the new Audi Q5, which rides on that brand’s Premium Platform Combustion (PPC) architecture. The original Macan was a twin of the Q5, but Porsche spent a lot of money and effort reengineering the car to make it worthy of the Stuttgart crest. That included new V-6 engines and an entirely bespoke all-wheel drive system.

That won’t be the case for this coming SUV. Autocar says that the ""M1"" will use the same front-wheel-drive-based Quattro Ultra all-wheel drive system as the Q5 and other new Audi models. In the Q5, the system operates as front-wheel drive in most normal driving scenarios, but shifts torque rearwards when deemed necessary. It can send a maximum of 70 percent of engine torque rearwards, and in some models, Quattro Ultra employs an electronic rear differential that can bias torque across the axle.

It’s a more efficient system than the traditional Torsen-center-differential Quattro all-wheel drive, or the original Macan’s Porsche Traction Management, which always sent power to the rear. That’s good for helping hit the increasingly strict fuel-economy and emissions targets Porsche (and every other automaker) faces everywhere except the US these days.

Using Quattro Ultra is also cheaper and easier for Porsche. When confirming the ""M1"" project this past summer, Porsche CEO Oliver Blume said that the brand is aiming to develop this SUV in a relatively short three years.

And Porsche needs to save costs wherever it can. Taycan sales have fallen sharply, tariffs are hitting it hard in the US market, and Chinese customers are rejecting non-domestic brands like Porsche. The electric 718 Boxster and Cayman models are also significantly behind schedule and will be a tough sell when they arrive, as there doesn’t seem to be much of a market for electric sports cars.

But Porsche has never done a front-biased all-wheel drive system in its nearly 40-year history of selling all-wheel drive cars. It’s always gone for rear-drive bias for superior driving dynamics. The reality is that the ""M1 will still drive well thanks to ever-clever Porsche engineering, but it reflects just how much the fortunes have changed for a company that was once the envy of the entire auto industry.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/vx0Jw6/s1/porsche-macan-gts.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 07:59:53.413514

Campbell power plant, a local advocacy group is calling on Ottawa County to take control of the facility and create its own energy board.

The plant, originally scheduled to close in May, remains operational after the presidential directive. Current owner Consumers Energy has warned that keeping the plant open will likely result in higher utility bills for residents.

Ottawa County group pushes for local control of J.H. Campbell power plant

Joseph Parnell McCarter, volunteer leader of the group ""Save the Campbell,"" believes there's a way to keep the plant open without raising costs for consumers.

""Consumers Energy is very aggressive in terms of the net zero agenda, and so their strategy is to build more battery plants, solar fields,"" McCarter said. ""Those plans, which I think is an economic mistake, a mistake for our grid, and even an environmental mistake.""

McCarter is urging Ottawa County commissioners to pass a resolution requiring Consumers Energy to scale back its renewable energy efforts and explore contracts with AI data centers to keep the plant financially viable.

If Consumers Energy doesn't comply, McCarter suggests the county should consider taking control of the plant and establishing a countywide energy board.

""Our goal is to have a locally controlled electric that provides reliable, cost effective and environmentally responsible electric for us,"" McCarter explained.

County commissioners are divided on the proposal. Commissioner Joe Moss expressed support for exploring the idea.

""I definitely support an exploratory committee and I support the county being involved in general with that process,"" Moss said.

However, Commissioner Doug Zylstra, who voted against the original resolution to keep the plant open, opposes the new plan.

""I voted against the first resolution… I would also not be in favor of the Ottawa County board being involved in purchasing an aging coal plant,"" Zylstra said.

Zylstra questioned the economic viability of the proposal.

""The cost of production is the cost of production, and I think there are good reasons why consumers' energy is transitioning away from the Campbell plant,"" Zylstra said.

Despite acknowledging the challenges of creating a county-wide cooperative, Moss believes the board should examine the proposal.

""I think the board should definitely discuss it there have been ongoing discussions at the county level about the Campbell plant and energy policy in general,"" Moss said.

The county board has not announced whether it will formally consider the issue, though Zylstra indicated it could appear on a future agenda.

""The first resolution came fairly quickly, so it could happen that we take that up,"" Zylstra said.

But while attacking the ZEV mandate, the Conservative leader didn't say how he would reduce emissions from Canada's transportation sector.
The ZEV mandate is now officially under review.
It was implausible that the implementation of climate policy in Canada was ever going to be perfectly straightforward or without revision.","Mark Carney's announcement on Friday that implementation of the federal government's zero-emission vehicle mandate will be delayed by at least a year can be read as another retreat on climate policy from the new prime minister.

It can also be read as a small victory for Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, who had been calling on the government to abandon the policy.

That was certainly Poilievre's own reading of events.

""Today he's flip-flopped.… He's finally admitted that the Conservatives were right, just like we were right on the carbon tax,"" Poilievre told reporters on Parliament Hill.

But, the Conservative leader lamented, it was a ""clumsy retreat,"" because the prime minister was merely promising to ""delay"" the mandate.

""Mark Carney can't even get his flip-flops right,"" Poilievre said.

In fact, Carney says the ZEV sales mandate will be subject to a 60-day review. And so, for now, it's not clear whether the mandate — a major policy meant to drive down greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector — is actually dead or merely sleeping.

But deliberations on the mandate, Carney said, will be part of a larger review aimed at designing a new ""climate competitiveness"" strategy — upon which a lot, both politically and practically is now riding.

How the ZEV mandate got squeezed

The electric vehicle availability standard — what has come to be known as the ZEV mandate — sets out a series of escalating sales targets for automakers in Canada. For next year, the target would have been 20 per cent.

As with the federal carbon tax that he scrapped in March, Carney could plead that he inherited a troubled policy. Under the previous prime minister, the federal government allowed its EV consumer rebate to expire in January and that likely contributed to a significant drop in sales. Environment Minister Julie Dabrusin said in June that the government was working on a new rebate program, but that may have only further dissuaded potential consumers from making immediate purchases.

American tariffs on the automotive sector then gave the industry another reason to ask for relief.

It's also fair to note that Canada is not the only country where a new government has decided to fiddle with its existing ZEV mandate — in the United Kingdom, a Labour government recently amended a mandate that was originally introduced by a Conservative government.

But the British government did still keep a mandate in place. Asked on Friday whether he would consider fully repealing Canada's ZEV mandate, Carney did not offer a categorical answer.

""We're using this as an opportunity, as part of a broader strategy on climate competitiveness, to look at all our measures to help get greenhouse gases down,"" he said. ""And we'll look at the interactions between the EV mandate, our clean fuel standards, our investment tax credits, our trade policy — all of those elements — because what this government is focused on is absolutely results.""

Can the mandate be saved?

There may be paths to amending the mandate without abandoning it.

""Today's announcement of a delay in application by one year and a broader review of the policy can be an opportunity to better meet its most important objectives: giving consumers choice and getting EVs into the hands of those who want them,"" Clean Energy Canada's Joanna Kyriazis said in a statement on Friday.

If a lack of incentives or charging infrastructure is part of what's standing in the way of Canada keeping pace with other countries — EVs accounted for 21 per cent of new car sales in the European Union last year — that might be all the more reason for the federal government to double-down on such efforts.

Clean Energy Canada has a number of other suggestions: giving carmakers credit for either selling vehicles below $40,000 or offering zero-interest financing, adopting European safety standards to allow for the sale of a great variety of vehicles or, perhaps most controversially, lowering tariffs on Chinese-made EVs.

The Pembina Institute similarly said the government's options include ""extending credits for plug-in hybrid vehicle and charging infrastructure, modestly adjusting targets or re-evaluating tariffs on Chinese-made EVs.""

In his remarks on Friday, Carney said the government would ""advance new options to bring more and more affordable electric vehicles to Canadians."" But he declined to speculate on whether that might include reducing tariffs on Chinese EVs.

On Parliament Hill, Poilievre said he disagreed with Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe, who has called for Canada to drop those tariffs (retaliatory tariffs by China are punishing Saskatchewan's canola industry).

But while attacking the ZEV mandate, the Conservative leader didn't say how he would reduce emissions from Canada's transportation sector. Asked directly on Friday what he would do, Poilievre answered by saying he would aim to help other countries reduce their emissions.

What will Carney's climate strategy include?

Carney came to politics with a reputation for — and a track record of — putting his energy and time toward the cause of combatting climate change. Until January, he was the UN's special envoy on climate action and finance. In his book, Value(s), he wrote extensively about the challenge and on Friday he said combatting climate change was both a ""moral obligation"" and an imperative for global competitiveness.

But his first act as prime minister was to repeal the consumer carbon tax. The ZEV mandate is now officially under review. And the future of the proposed cap on emissions from the oil and gas sector is also uncertain.

""More than four months after its election, and in the wake of a destructive summer of climate change-driven drought, wildfires and smoke affecting millions of Canadians, the federal government has provided limited information about its intentions on climate policy,"" Rick Smith, president of the Canadian Climate Institute, said in a statement on Friday.

It was implausible that the implementation of climate policy in Canada was ever going to be perfectly straightforward or without revision. And it is still possible to knit together an ambitious climate agenda without policies like a carbon tax or a cap on oil and gas emissions.

Carney has said he would maintain and enhance the carbon-pricing benchmarks for industrial emissions and one of the criteria guiding the government's selection of ""nation-building"" infrastructure projects is ""contribut[ing] to clean growth and to meeting Canada's objectives with respect to climate change.""",https://i.cbc.ca/1.7626806.1757109833!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/carney-tariffs-20250905.jpg?im=Resize%3D620,N,,2025-09-06 06:59:23.489033

Greater Washington Region Clean Cities Coalition (GRWCCC) hosted the event, the latest installment in a series of job fairs they have organized in the Washington, D.C., metro area. To GWRCCC, job fairs are a critical way to provide connections that lead to employment opportunities. The job fairs bring a sense of confidence and positivity for people impacted by unemployment.

When GRWCCC first started hosting the job fairs in 2022, they focused on employers that could provide jobs in the clean energy and transportation sectors. This year, the coalition concentrated on quality, long-term, and sustainable employment opportunities that can support people struggling with unemployment.

“Bringing community members who are experiencing hardship to employers with quality jobs and making that process inviting is important,” said Association Manager Kimberly Harden, who supports event planning at GWRCCC and organizes the job fairs.

For the Baltimore fair, Greater Paradise Christian Center converted its sanctuary into a space for job seekers, the majority between 18 and 40 years old, to visit 17 employers who offered onsite interviews, job listings, and information about available positions. Job seekers also visited professional coaches and recruiters. Many employers in attendance were nonprofits and government agencies, including the state of Maryland, Job Corps, Maryland Environmental Service, the National Guard, and a solar company, in addition to entities that provided job training.

GWRCCC is one of more than 75 U.S. Department of Energy-designated Clean Cities and Communities coalitions across the country. These coalitions work to deploy affordable and efficient transportation fuels, energy efficient mobility systems, and other cost-saving technologies and practices.

GWRCCC’s mission involves creating networks of local stakeholders and providing technical assistance to implement alternative and renewable fuels, idle-reduction measures, fuel economy improvements, and emerging transportation technologies. The networks and connections that come with this work make the coalition uniquely suited for its role as a community connector. GWRCCC brings resources directly to those who need them most and ensures that environmental benefits are also economic benefits.

“We don’t have the bandwidth to provide customized support to individuals in the communities we serve, but we can connect people in underserved communities with these opportunities and help provide motivation and inspiration through informational resources,” Harden said.

By connecting job seekers and employers, GWRCCC is creating multifaceted relationships that benefit all involved. These relationships bring extra quality and commitment to their job fairs through dependable, valuable employment opportunities, and community-based organizations spread the word, putting opportunities and connections within reach.

GWRCCC often works with partner organizations and other free or low-cost event spaces to host job fairs, and the coalition provides informational flyers for the events. In some cases, professional coaches continue working with potential employees after the job fairs to connect them with opportunities that match their skillsets and experience. One employer held an informational entrepreneurial conference during a fair to share ideas for making money while looking for employment. Miss Maryland also attended the July fair, promoting the event live from a video on the GRWCCC Facebook page.

The coalition’s definition of success isn’t simply hosting a fair. While some employers report how many inquiries they received from the job fair, the coalition often hears about the success of their job fairs from networking events and other interactions with stakeholders and board members. A local employer thanked GWRCCC for the opportunity and reported that they received great prospects.",https://www.act-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/job-fair.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 06:59:34.498397

Rivian bets big on smaller R2

After launching the R1T pickup truck and the R1S SUV, Rivian is now readying to introduce the R2, a midsize electric SUV to be offered starting at $45,000 USD. Its mandate is to reach a broader customer base and compete directly with the Tesla Model Y, Ford Mustang Mach-E and Hyundai Ioniq 5.

To prepare for production of the R2, Rivian will temporarily close its factory for three weeks in September 2025 to install a new assembly line dedicated to the model.

GM and VW also curb their ambitions

Rivian is not the only company rethinking its plans in the face of expiring federal credits and a market slowdown.

General Motors will temporarily suspend EV production at its Spring Hill, Tennessee, plant for several weeks this fall. This measure will notably affect the Cadillac Lyriq and Vistiq.

For its part, Volkswagen announced last week a slowdown in production of the all-electric ID.4 at its Chattanooga plant. That will entail a temporary layoff of 160 employees at the end of October. According to the manufacturer, this is a “market-driven decision” to adjust production volumes to demand.

An unfavorable economic context

The end of the tax credits, combined with the rising cost of raw materials and pressure from tariffs, is complicating the profitability of EVs for manufacturers.

Rivian recorded a net loss of $1.1 billion USD in the second quarter of 2025. The company expects to deliver between 40,000 and 46,000 vehicles by the end of the year, a decrease from the 51,579 units delivered in 2024.

Rivian has already slightly increased its prices for 2026: the R1T starts at $72,885 USD and the R1S at $78,885 USD (fees included). The disappearance of the federal tax credit will make high-end EVs less attractive. Rivian hopes to attract a wider audience with the more accessible price of the R2, but the competition is set to be fierce.

The current slowdown in the EV market is not a simple accident: it reflects the limits of demand in a context where government incentives are disappearing. Rivian, GM, and Volkswagen are adjusting their strategies to navigate this period of uncertainty by betting on more affordable models better suited to actual demand.",http://picolio.auto123.com/auto123-media/articles/2025/9/73167/2026-rivian-r2-002afr.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 13:02:26.716390

Our world is changing faster than ever. Climate shocks—extreme heat, floods, fires—are becoming the new normal. At the same time, our demand for reliable, affordable energy is skyrocketing. From AI to data centers to the electrification of everything, we need more power—and we need clean power.

Offshore wind is already delivering; with multiple projects under construction, this industry is poised to provide nearly 6 GW—enough to power over 1.4 million homes—before the decade’s end. In my home state of Maryland, where I serve as a Climate Commissioner, voters overwhelmingly support it—not just for environmental justice but because offshore wind can stabilize energy prices and deliver real economic benefits.

Politics and Pushback: The Trump Administration’s Attack

Yet that progress is being threatened. The Trump administration has ramped up a targeted assault on offshore wind beyond the Executive Memorandum issued on the President’s first day in office—issuing stop-work orders, freezing funding, and even trying to vacate permits for fully approved projects.

• In Rhode Island and Connecticut, Revolution Wind—80% complete and designed to power 350,000 homes—has been halted by a federal order citing vague “national security” concerns. The project’s owner, Ørsted, and two states have sued in response.

• The administration is also seeking to revoke approval for the New England and South Coast Winds projects. The Massachusetts project alone is projected to serve up to 900,000 homes.

• In Maryland, the US Wind project near Ocean City—a hard-won victory after years of development and permitting review—is now under legal threat as the administration moves to rescind that permit.

Oceantic leaders have been vocal in response. Sam Salustro, SVP at Oceantic, called it “a devastating assault on U.S. workers and businesses,” warning that revoking permits “after years of review will raise electricity prices for millions, jeopardize billions in private investment, and unravel a domestic $25 billion supply chain across 40 states.” And CEO Liz Burdock signed a legal declaration, under ACE NY, in support of the 17 states Attorneys General lawsuit challenging the legality of the Executive Memorandum. The filing delivered hard evidence of the economic damage inflicted—including staff layoffs, stranded assets, and lost or unrealized revenue—because the “President is not a fan of wind.”

This is not a theoretical fight. It’s a political blitz—and one that demands collective action.

Jen Brock: Leading with Heart and Resolve

This is where Jen Brock’s warmth and grit becomes invaluable. Whether she’s shepherding a Maryland business through Oceantic’s accredited market entry coaching program, managing cross-functional clean energy initiatives, or standing up for U.S. supply chain jobs, she does it with poise and urgency.

Her recent work—like advocating to protect US Wind’s permit in Maryland’s courts—is about more than policy. It’s personal. Brock celebrated her daughter Dylan’s Bat Mitzvah on May 4, 2024, where Dylan delivered a D’var Torah blending Star Wars with climate action—“May the Fourth be with you,” she proclaimed—reminding us that these struggles are about our kids and their futures.

I was with Brock recently at a major conference for County officials from Maryland. I watched her work with union leaders, environmental activists and our governor, Wes Moore. Thankfully, Moore is supporting the expansion of clean energy.

We Must Push Harder

With mounting threats—halted projects, pulled funding, and political roadblocks—anyone who cares about clean, affordable energy must dig in harder. We need to elevate voices like Brock’s: solution-driven, people-focused, and unafraid to stand up for what’s right.

As demand surges—from AI platforms to homes and factories—offshore wind is a scalable, reliable, prove solution that is cost-competitive and can be deployed relatively rapidly compared to nearly all other energy sources today. It can grow our clean energy capacity, lower costs, and protect our shared environment—if it’s allowed to proceed.

A Call to Action

Offshore wind isn’t just an energy answer—it’s part of a moral calling. In Jewish tradition, tikkun olam—repairing the world—demands more than words; it demands action. Jen Brock’s leadership shows us what that looks like: bold, grounded, smart, and unstoppable.

Let’s rally behind leaders like her—because the time is now. Whether through policy advocacy, public support, or simply spreading the word: the fight is real, the stakes are high, and we must act with both charm and grit to win.",https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/blogs/uploads/2025/09/Jen-Brock-speaks-with-Maryland-Governor-Wes-Moore-and-Marylands-First-Lady-Dawn-Flythe-Moore-about-offshore-wind.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 11:01:15.055015

The upgrading plants are necessary because swine gas has a different chemical composition than gas derived from fossil fuels.
Of those, 14 have completed construction and are generating swine gas, or able to.","The Trump administration has cancelled a $417,000 federal grant that would have funded research on the social and economic impacts of biogas production from industrialized swine operations in North Carolina.

Over several years, scientists from RTI International in Durham and the Gillings School of Public Health at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill had planned to continuously monitor the air, and periodically sample rivers, streams, and private drinking water in Duplin and Sampson counties. The study would also have collected health data in the communities.

Duplin and Sampson rank first and second in the nation, respectively, in the number of swine farms, according to a University of Michigan study. They account for 4.2 million hogs on roughly 900 farms, state environmental data shows, a small percentage of which have received state permits to produce biogas.

Census data show tracts near these concentrated animal feeding operations—CAFOs—are predominantly Black, Indigenous or Latino.

The research is important because swine gas operations are proliferating in North Carolina. Yet there is scant data on the environmental and health effects near these facilities, according to the RTI and UNC scientists.

The community research conducted in Duplin and Sampson counties on the biogas production project was sponsored by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and National Institute of Environmental and Health Sciences (NIEHS).

The biogas study was one of at least 1,700 projects that lost funding earlier this year after the Trump administration terminated $783 million in grants at NIEHS’ parent agency, the National Institutes of Health. Although it is unclear if the biogas study was singled out for its environmental justice focus , similar projects were targeted.

The U.S. Supreme Court last month upheld the administration’s cuts by a 5-4 vote. A lower court judge had blocked the cancellations on the grounds that they were discriminatory.

The North Carolina scientists, led by Crystal Lee Pow Jackson, had conducted one round of private well sampling and collected initial air quality data, but had yet to sample near an active swine gas operation when the Trump administration canceled the grant.

“We couldn’t complete the full research but there is valuable baseline data in this,” said Courtney Woods, an associate professor in UNC’s Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering. She also leads programs at the university in Environment, Climate and Health and Health Equity and Social Justice.

Major pork producers tout biogas as a solution to the industry’s methane problem. In 2018, swine manure emitted 970,000 tons of methane nationally, federal data show, second only to dairy.

Methane is short-lived in the atmosphere, but it inflicts more damage to the climate than carbon dioxide. Over 20 years, methane is 86 times more potent at warming the planet than CO2, which remains in the atmosphere for centuries.

Swine CAFOs generate biogas by capping waste lagoons, capturing the methane they emit and injecting the gas into a pipeline. Some CAFOs use the gas to power farm operations.

Yet the industry’s position doesn’t account for pipeline leaks. And in North Carolina, swine biogas systems still pump extra feces and urine into a second open-air lagoon; from there, the waste is sprayed on fields as fertilizer. Fecal contamination can seep into the groundwater and private drinking water wells from the spraying; methane, ammonia and hydrogen sulfide from the lagoons still enter the air, unabated.

Align RNG, a partnership between Dominion Energy and Smithfield Foods, the world’s largest pork producer, receives swine gas from a half dozen CAFOs in Sampson and Duplin counties, according to state records from 2024. The farms ship their gas through 30 miles of low-pressure pipelines to Align RNG’s upgrading facility near Warsaw, a small town off Interstate 40 in Duplin County.

Align RNG did not respond to an email summarizing Inside Climate News’ reporting and inviting comment.

The upgrading plants are necessary because swine gas has a different chemical composition than gas derived from fossil fuels. Constituents such as hydrogen sulfide, nitrogen,ammonia and carbon dioxide must be removed before the gas can be injected into a traditional pipeline. These “tail gases” are scrubbed of hydrogen sulfide and burned in an enclosed flare.

Once the swine gas is upgraded, Align RNG injects it into a nearby pipeline owned by Piedmont Natural Gas, a subsidiary of Duke Energy, which uses it to generate electricity.

Align RNG estimates as many as 19 swine CAFOs could eventually ship their gas to the plant in Warsaw. Kraig Westerbeek, then-vice president of Align RNG, told the state Division of Air Quality in 2020 that the participating farms would reduce their collective methane emissions each year by 150,000 tons, measured as carbon dioxide equivalent. CO2 equivalent is a unit of measurement that standardizes the global warming potential of different greenhouse gases.

The company plans to build a second upgrading plant near Bowdens, also in Duplin County. It would accept gas from as many as 35 swine CAFOs, according to the Align RNG website. Construction is expected to finish by late 2026. The company has yet to apply for an air permit, according to a state database.

State records show that there are 55 swine CAFOs with biodigester permits. Of those, 14 have completed construction and are generating swine gas, or able to. Another 41 have yet to notify the state that they’ve finished construction. The state is reviewing permit applications for another 30 farms.

Since 2012, Duke Energy, municipal utilities and electric cooperatives have been legally required to generate or source a small percentage, up to 0.2 percent, of their prior year’s total retail electricity sales from swine waste.

However, the N.C. Utilities Commission has delayed its implementation because “the technology of power production from swine waste continues to face challenges and that swine waste-to-energy projects continue to experience operational difficulties,” a commission report from 2020 reads.

Blakely Hildebrand, a senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, filed a civil rights complaint with the EPA Office of External Rights Compliance four years ago over the biogas permits. The law center submitted the complaint on behalf of its clients, the Duplin County NAACP and the North Carolina Poor People’s Campaign.

The complaint alleged that, in issuing the biogas permits, the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality discriminated against Black and Latino residents in eastern North Carolina because the facilities had a disparate, harmful impact on those communities.

Since 2022, SELC and the state have been negotiating to resolve some of the allegations, Hildebrand said.

“We’ve not yet resolved the complaint,” Hildebrand said, “and the Trump administration has taken several steps to undermine civil rights law and environmental justice policy.”

In the spring, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin canceled more than 400 environmental justice grants. In late August, the EPA fired more than two dozen remaining staffers in the now-defunct Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced last month it would stop funding wind and solar power installations on farmland.

The biogas conditioning plants are also sources of pollution. Align RNG’s Warsaw plant could emit 64 to 220 tons of pollutants each year, according to the company’s air quality permit.

Sulfur dioxide accounts for more than 75 percent of the potential emissions produced during biogas processing. Short-term exposure to sulfur dioxide can harm the respiratory system and make breathing difficult, according to the EPA. People with asthma, particularly children, are sensitive to these effects.

Precise figures from the upgrading facility aren’t publicly available because Align RNG doesn’t have to file an emissions inventory until 2028, state records show.

Earlier Air and Water Testing

RTI and UNC scientists presented limited results from their study in August in Sampson County at a meeting of EJCAN, an environmental and social justice group in Clinton. The preliminary data reflected the baseline environmental conditions because the biogas project is not in full operation, an RTI spokesperson said.

All of the 11 surface water sampling sites tested before the grant cancellation contained total coliform and E. coli bacteria at least once. In some cases, levels of E. coli exceeded state surface water standards.

(The N.C. Department of Environmental Quality currently uses fecal coliform as an indicator, but is switching to E. coli to align with EPA methods.)

Levels of nitrite, ammonia and nitrate concentrations were below surface water standards. However, phosphorus, which can supercharge harmful algal blooms, peaked at more than 30 times the levels at which algae could begin to multiply.

One-time air monitoring outside 13 homes within two miles of swine CAFOs, also conducted prior to the grant cancellation, detected nitrogen dioxide below National Ambient Air Quality Standards.

The scientists also found ammonia and hydrogen sulfide at similar levels reported by other studies in North Carolina, although there are no state standards for those compounds in for community ambient air. There were brief spikes of fine particulate matter, known as PM 2.5, at unhealthy levels for a few hours, said Seung-Hyun Cho, the air monitoring project leader.

The scientists wanted to survey more community members about their views on swine gas operations, as well as the state of their physical and mental health. Yet despite the study’s limitations, residents were able to participate in the research, itself a valuable exercise. “We successfully engaged the community in environmental monitoring,” Courtney Woods, the UNC associate professor and researcher, said.

Most of the participants weren’t aware of the swine gas operations, Woods said. But they were concerned about persistent odor, health impacts and emotional stress of living near CAFOs in general.

While those surveyed said the hog industry provided economic benefits, Woods said, “they wanted clear answers on health impacts.”

The deleterious health impacts of living near swine CAFOs—even those without biodigesters—have been well documented. A University of Michigan study released last month found that census tracts near these facilities had 11 percent higher levels of PM 2.5 than those tracts without them, even when accounting for urban and industrial sources.

Epidemiologists have found that exposure to elevated levels of PM 2.5 is linked to asthma, cardiovascular disease, bronchitis, leukemia and Alzheimer’s disease. Researchers at the American Medical Association have found increases in overall death rates, heart attacks and lung cancer corresponding with increases in PM 2.5 levels. These health effects have been observed in residents as far as 11 miles from the farms.

Julia Kravchenko, an assistant professor of surgery and of population health sciences at Duke University, discovered similar trends in 2018. North Carolina communities located near hog CAFOs had higher all-cause and infant mortality, deaths due to anemia, kidney disease, tuberculosis, septicemia, and higher hospital admissions of low-birth-weight infants, Kravchenko found, but the study did not establish causality.

The Trump administration’s cancellation of the grant hampers the public’s ability to scrutinize the burgeoning industry. “I think communities have a right to know how their health is going to be affected,” Hildebrand, of the SELC, said. “And regulators need to know that as well, so that they can put protections in place to keep the environment safe and to ensure that the people who live near these facilities are kept safe as well.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/t4i6348.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 06:02:42.635951

Bottom Line If clean energy tax credits are important to your business, evaluate your ownership, financing and supply chain structures.","The U.S. government has been steadily tightening rules relating to who can benefit from clean energy incentives. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) is the latest step, and it makes one thing crystal clear: if your company has ties to certain foreign governments, your access to federal tax credits could be at risk and you should carefully consider the source of any debt financing. Here is what you need to know.

Who Gets Blocked from Tax Credits?

The OBBBA introduced several new entity categories, all under the umbrella term “prohibited foreign entity” (PFE), which are barred from obtaining clean energy tax credits. A PFE is either a—

Specified Foreign Entity (SFE), which includes:

Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOCs),

Chinese military companies,

Entities on national security watchlists, and

Foreign-Controlled Entities (FCEs)—entities owned or controlled by, or with sufficient ties to, a “covered nation” (i.e., North Korea, China, Russia, and Iran).

Foreign-Influenced Entity (FIE), which refers to companies where SFEs hold significant influence, such as:

Large ownership stakes,

Debt holdings, and

Contracts that effectively let the SFEs steer operations.

Notably, an entity is an FIE if at least 15% of its debt is issued, in the aggregate, to one or more SFEs (the “15% debt threshold”).

An organization can be labeled an FEOC if it is:

on a terrorism or sanctions list,

named on the U.S. Treasury’s Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list,

owned, controlled by, or subject to the jurisdiction or direction of a government of a “covered nation,”

accused by the Attorney General of involvement in a serious crime, or

determined to be engaged in unauthorized conduct that is detrimental to national security or foreign policy.

Even partial ownership, voting rights, grants, debt, or board seats can be enough to trigger concern

If your business is an SFE or FIE, you will not be eligible for clean energy tax credits.

Which Tax Credits Are Affected?

Starting in 2025, restrictions kick in for a wide range of incentives, including credits for:

Nuclear power generation (45U)

Clean electricity (45Y, 48E)

Manufacturing clean energy components (45X)

Clean fuel production (45Z)

Carbon capture and storage (45Q)

Some bans began immediately upon enactment of OBBBA, while others phase in by 2027. Additionally, credits cannot be transferred or sold to SFEs, and harsher penalties are imposed for misstatements of tax liability due to disallowed credits under the PFE rules.

Why This Matters for Financing?

As noted, it is not just about ownership—financing and supply chain ties matter too. If your company uses loans or financing from an SFE, that alone can disqualify your company from tax credits (i.e., if you become an FIE).

On the debt capital markets front, we have been receiving queries from underwriters working with issuers in the energy and utility sector concerning the 15% debt threshold and its potential impact on debt securities offerings. For instance, underwriters are exploring whether and to what extent they can avoid placing with or reselling notes to, SFEs as well as the practical implications of implementing or monitoring compliance. Issuers, on the other hand, are exploring seeking additional or stronger representations from underwriters that no distributions of securities will be made by them to SFEs or FIEs either altogether or in excess of the 15% debt threshold. In one transaction we are aware of, the terms of the securities gave the issuer the right to redeem bonds at 101% upon a “Tax Credit Event” which was defined as any time in the reasonable determination of the issuer that payment of interest under the bonds would result in the issuer being unable to utilize its tax credits. It will be interesting to see how the market develops to tackle these issues and whether any regulatory relief or clarification will be forthcoming.

Bottom Line

If clean energy tax credits are important to your business, evaluate your ownership, financing and supply chain structures. Affected borrowers and lenders may include contractual language in loan or credit agreements addressing these issues and underwriters in bond offerings may need to explore ways (e.g. contractually and/or operationally) to avoid selling (or limit sales of) securities to certain foreign lenders.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15924_5512.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 11:01:19.225222

As the EU accelerates its transition away from Russian hydrocarbons, the U.S. energy sector stands to gain significant opportunities—but also faces risks tied to infrastructure constraints, policy alignment, and geopolitical tensions.

Market Dynamics: A New Era for Global Energy Flows

The EU’s REPowerEU initiative, launched in 2022, has already reduced Russian gas imports from 45% in 2022 to 19% in 2025, despite a 18% rebound in 2024 driven by liquefied natural gas (LNG) and pipeline deliveries [1]. By 2028, the EU aims to fully phase out Russian oil and gas, a timeline reinforced by legal proposals to ban new contracts for Russian energy and address “shadow fleets” evading sanctions [5]. This transition creates a vacuum that the U.S. is positioning itself to fill.

U.S. LNG exports to the EU surged to $12.2 billion in 2024, with the U.S.-EU trade agreement committing the EU to purchase $750 billion in energy resources (including LNG, oil, and nuclear fuel) over three years [2]. However, analysts question the feasibility of this target, citing U.S. export capacity limits and the EU’s parallel push for renewables. For instance, U.S. LNG terminals operate near full capacity, and expanding infrastructure requires years of investment [4]. Meanwhile, the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive aims to boost renewables to 42.5% of energy consumption by 2030, potentially reducing long-term demand for fossil fuels [1].

Geopolitical Risks: Fragmentation and Strategic Dependencies

The EU’s phase-out plan is not without internal friction. Hungary and Slovakia, which rely on Russian crude via the Druzhba pipeline, have resisted the 2028 timeline, arguing it would destabilize energy prices [3]. This resistance highlights the risk of fragmented implementation, which could delay the EU’s energy independence and create market volatility. Additionally, the end of Ukrainian gas transit in 2025—a route accounting for half of Russia’s pipeline exports to the EU—has shifted geopolitical risks to Central and Eastern Europe, where countries like Austria and Hungary face supply disruptions [3].

For U.S. investors, these dynamics underscore the importance of diversifying energy partnerships. While the U.S. has become the EU’s largest LNG supplier (46% of European LNG imports in 2024 [2]), overreliance on U.S. fossil fuels could clash with the EU’s decarbonization goals. Eurelectric Secretary General Christian Rubi has warned that prioritizing LNG over renewables could undermine the EU’s strategic autonomy and divert resources from critical clean energy infrastructure [4].

U.S. Energy Sector Opportunities: LNG, Renewables, and Policy Alignment

Despite challenges, the U.S. energy sector is strategically positioned to benefit from the EU’s transition. U.S. LNG producers like Cheniere Energy are expanding export terminals, with projects in Louisiana and Texas aiming to double capacity by 2027 [2]. Similarly, renewable energy firms such as NextEra Energy are capitalizing on EU investments in clean power technologies, aligning with Europe’s sustainability goals [2].

The U.S.-EU trade agreement also includes provisions for nuclear energy collaboration, with U.S. firms like Westinghouse and NuScale vying to supply reactors to the EU [1]. However, the Trump administration’s rollback of climate policies—such as withdrawing from the Paris Agreement and easing methane regulations—poses risks. These moves could create a policy misalignment with the EU, which has maintained its climate commitments, including the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) [5].

Policy Alignment and Investment Returns

The alignment of U.S. and EU policies will be critical in shaping returns for energy investments. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has spurred U.S. cleantech manufacturing, but Trump-era deregulation and tariffs on solar and wind components have slowed renewable growth [3]. This divergence could limit the EU’s ability to source clean energy from the U.S., favoring domestic or Asian suppliers instead.

Conversely, U.S. companies that pivot toward renewables and carbon capture technologies—such as Occidental and Plug Power—stand to gain from EU green energy partnerships. A 2025 Oxford Sustainable Finance Group report estimates that €811 billion in renewable investments could replace Russian gas in the EU by 2028, offering long-term opportunities for U.S. firms with scalable clean energy solutions [4].

Conclusion: Strategic Value and Geopolitical Realities

The EU’s 2028 Russian oil exit is a pivotal moment for global energy markets, with the U.S. energy sector at the center of both opportunity and risk. While LNG exports and nuclear partnerships present immediate gains, the long-term viability of these investments depends on infrastructure expansion, policy alignment, and the EU’s renewable transition.

Portland General Electric and its partner Mitsubishi Power have quietly shelved a planned hydrogen production, storage and hydrogen-fueled generation complex near Boardman, Oregon.

“Given the exit of an essential project partner in June, along with challenging project economics for utility customers and federal policy changes, PGE is no longer pursuing” the hydrogen complex, PGE spokesman Drew Hanson said via email.

The cancellation comes at a dicey time for the tri-state Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub, the ringleader that is channeling federal money to projects in the region. The U.S. Energy Department is scrutinizing clean energy programs and initiatives launched under the Biden administration, including the Northwest hub. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said he is ready to terminate funding for projects that he deems “a bridge to nowhere.”

Elected officials from across the political spectrum in the Northwest have defended low-emissions hydrogen as a promising means to create new jobs and meet climate goals, particularly in sectors that are proving difficult to convert directly to clean electric power.

“We have several new projects in the pipeline that we’re excited to share more on soon,” spokesperson Kaitlin Sheppard said in an emailed statement on behalf of the Northwest hydrogen hub. “PNWH2 continues to evaluate additional project interest and remains focused on supporting a broad, resilient regional hydrogen ecosystem with the potential to deliver lasting economic value to Oregon and the greater Pacific Northwest.”

The PGE and Mitsubishi Power pullback follows in the wake of the scrapping of a different hydrogen factory in Centralia, Washington, proposed by Fortescue, which was to be one of the primary producers of the alternative fuel within the regional clean energy hub. Another founding partner in the PNWH2 Hub, Seattle-based developer of hydrogen-powered mining trucks First Mode, declared bankruptcy last December.

PGE’s pivot calls into question what will happen at the nearby Port of Morrow, where Air Liquide planned to build a hydrogen liquefaction plant to support distribution of clean hydrogen to urban fueling stations and the ports of Seattle and Tacoma. PGE and Mitsubishi were supposed to supply the gaseous hydrogen to Air Liquide via a short pipeline from the site of PGE’s demolished coal power plant outside Boardman.

Air Liquide acknowledged a request for comment, but a spokesperson declined to shed more light about where things are headed now.

The Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub said in its emailed statement that “project adjustments were expected and planned for” in the early development phase of the nascent industry. The pullback in this region tracks with what is happening elsewhere.

Brand name corporations — such as Shell, BP and Airbus — and lesser-known startups around the world are scaling back their hydrogen ambitions. Commonly cited reasons include a slower-than-anticipated emergence of customer demand and stubbornly high costs to produce green hydrogen.

The developers behind the two remaining large-scale projects in the Northwest hydrogen hub are pressing ahead. Switzerland-based Atlas Agro plans to build a $1.5 billion green fertilizer factory near Richland, Washington, for which hydrogen produced on site will be a key ingredient. Meanwhile, Calgary-based AltaGas has a costly plan to redevelop the closed Alcoa aluminum smelter near Ferndale, Washington, to produce climate-friendly hydrogen for refinery use, transportation fuel and possibly power generation.

Crucially, Atlas Agro and AltaGas need to secure large volumes of affordable renewable electricity for the energy-intensive process of making hydrogen. The green fertilizer plant reportedly needs around 300 megawatts of power, which is a bigger load than all of the rest of Richland combined.

AltaGas estimated last year that it needs about 265 megawatts of electricity to achieve its maximum production target at Ferndale. Neither company has confirmed they have a power supply contract amid rising competition for sources of renewable electricity.

“The success of this project is contingent on regulatory and financial incentive certainty, timely approvals, and a clear and predictable path forward from government and commercial partners,” said Andrea McNamara Doyle, Washington state external affairs manager for AltaGas, in an emailed statement.

The Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub game plan envisions that producers will make “green” hydrogen exclusively by splitting water molecules with an electric current. This process (known as electrolysis) must use renewable electricity for the resulting hydrogen to be considered green.

Uncertain Government Support

A year ago, the Pacific NW hub collected the first installment from its potentially $1 billion federal allocation. That $27.5 million in initial funding through the Energy Department partially passed through to participating companies and to Washington State University to begin site planning and community outreach.

Under the original program terms, another tranche of funding would come 12-18 months after the first to subsidize developer permitting and engineering. A third tranche could underwrite the construction phase for multiple years, before a possible final shot of money comes to subsidize production ramp up. In all, the hub could pass through federal subsidies to its participants for 8-12 years.

But this past May, Wright, President Donald Trump’s energy secretary, announced a department-wide review of grant programs to root out “wasteful spending of taxpayer dollars.” Wright expressed skepticism about government support to scale up clean hydrogen.

“Hydrogen, it’s tough with the math to see how in the long term it becomes a meaningful commercial energy source,” Wright told senators at a budget hearing in front of the Senate Energy Committee in June, during which Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Washington, pressed him to state his position on the hydrogen hubs.

“It’s expensive to produce, but there are high value uses,” Wright went on to say about hydrogen. He predicted the agency will continue funding some projects under review, modify others and terminate the “low-value” ones.

Cantwell responded that the Northwest’s renewable hydropower made her region a good place to make hydrogen for hard-to-decarbonize sectors.

A spokesperson at Energy Department headquarters confirmed this past week that the program vetting was ongoing, but declined to estimate when the results will become known.

Democrats in the U.S. Senate preemptively wrote a joint letter to Wright in April asserting it would be illegal for the Trump administration to unilaterally cancel Congressionally-approved spending on clean energy projects. Oregon’s Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley and Washington’s Patty Murray and Cantwell signed on.

“Our Constitution gives Congress the power of the purse and exclusive power to appropriate funds,” the 27 senators wrote. “In this instance, where Congress has authorized and appropriated funds for programs that support clean energy projects, the Department must faithfully execute the law and expend the funds for the purposes provided.”

If the PNWH2 Hub survives the Energy Department vetting, the pressure will still be on. Earlier this year, the Republican-controlled Congress shortened the window for companies to get lucrative tax incentives that were created in the 2022 Biden climate and clean energy package.

Private developers now have until the end of 2027 to begin construction on a hydrogen plant in order to qualify for production tax credits. The deadline was previously 2033. Clean hydrogen producers strive to qualify for the tax credit in order to lower the otherwise high retail price of the fuel.

“Under current federal and state permitting regimes, this accelerated timeline may jeopardize our eligibility for the tax credit, which is essential for achieving positive project returns, and we are evaluating our ability to meet the new timelines,” said Doyle from AltaGas.

The EV company is set to hold its annual shareholders meeting on Nov. 6, where investors will vote on the new pay package.","The world's richest man could become its first trillionaire if Elon Musk hits a series of extremely aggressive targets for his electric car company over the next decade, according to a proposed pay package released by the company.

Tesla said in a regulatory filing Friday that it will hand Musk shares worth as much as 12% of the company in a dozen separate packages if the company meets certain performance targets, including massive increases in car production, share price and operating profit. If approved by shareholders, the new pay package could make Musk the world’s first trillion dollar executive, and would mark a new level of outsized pay in a country already known for extreme compensation. But the payoff is in shares, not cash, and the goals are extreme as well.

Musk overcame doubters to turn Tesla into the world's most valuable car company, but he could face even steeper odds in hitting the targets set by the company's compensation committee — not least because of Tesla’s main business of making electric vehicles is currently in a slump, in part because of Musk's foray into right-wing politics.

“It doesn’t matter how much money he gets. He can’t help himself,” said Telemetry analyst Sam Abuelsamid who follows Tesla stock, which has plummeted 27% from its December high. “And the more he talks, the more he turns off potential customers.”

To get his first package of shares equivalent to 1% of the company, Musk would have to convince investors in the stock market that Tesla is worth $2 trillion in total, double what they value it today, and also hit several other milestones. To receive all the shares offered and make him the world’s first trillion-dollar man would require that market value to then rise to $8.5 trillion, double that of the world’s most valuable company now, chipmaker Nvidia.

Among other goals, sales of all Tesla vehicles would eventually also have to reach 20 million, nearly triple its entire sales since it was founded more than two decades ago. Musk would also have to vastly expand Tesla's robot and robotaxi businesses by selling a million of the bots and a million of the driverless cabs, the latter a business that has only begun to roll out its taxi service and is behind rivals, such as Waymo.

Musk would also need to remain with Tesla for at least seven and a half years to cash out on any stock, and 10 years to earn the full amount.

Musk has been one of the richest people in the world for several years. He is currently estimated to be worth more than $400 billion by Forbes magazine.

A condition of the 11th and 12th tranches of the plan includes Musk coming up with a framework for someone to succeed him as CEO.

The plunge in Tesla sales this year was largely due to blowback over Musk’s affiliation with President Donald Trump. Tesla also faces intensifying competition from the big Detroit automakers and particularly from China.

Tesla sales have fallen precipitously in Europe after Musk aligned with a far-right political party in German. Sales plunged 40% in July in the 27 European Union countries compared with the year earlier even as sales overall of electric vehicle soared, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association. Meanwhile sales of Chinese rival BYD continued to climb fast, grabbing 1.1% market share of all car sales in the month versus Tesla’s 0.7%.

Without a reversal of those trends, meeting the financial goals could prove especially difficult. In its most recent quarter, Tesla reported that quarterly profits plunged from $1.39 billion to $409 million. Revenue also fell and the company came up short of even the lowered expectations on Wall Street.

Investors have grown increasingly worried about the trajectory of the company after Musk had spent so much time in Washington this year, becoming one of the most prominent officials in the Trump administration in its bid to slash the size of the U.S. government.

Even bulls on the stock are not convinced the new pay incentive will keep Musk, who frequently posts on his X social media platform, from saying things that alienate potential buyers.

Said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, “Fixing the Musk brand damage remains a work in progress."" Even so, Ives told clients, “We believe this was the smart move by the Board as the biggest asset for Tesla is Musk.”

In January 2024, a Delaware judge threw out Musk’s previous pay package, worth $44.9 billion at the time. Investors voted to restore that compensation package at Tesla’s last shareholders meeting on June 13 of last year. But late last year the package was revoked for a second time. Tesla has appealed the ruling. Last month, Tesla said that it gave Musk a stock grant of $29 billion as a reward for years of “transformative and unprecedented” growth — despite the drop in sales and profits — and noting that the CEO hadn’t been paid in years.

The EV company is set to hold its annual shareholders meeting on Nov. 6, where investors will vote on the new pay package. Musk would also receive more voting power over Tesla under the proposed plan. Musk has said that he needed more shares and control so he couldn’t be ousted by shareholder activists. If he does hit all the goals, Musk would own about quarter of the company’s shares, up from 13% today.

In just a few years, the country has boosted its renewable and nuclear energy capacity. This growth not only surpasses much of the world but also sets the stage for future industrial growth.

China’s focus on clean energy is making it the top choice for the digital age. This comes as AI, robotics, and large data centers use huge amounts of power.

Recent charts show clear momentum: China’s solar output now exceeds U.S. nuclear generation. Also, its nuclear expansion is the largest globally. These developments are not accidental. They come from careful planning, state funding, and a choice to lead in clean energy and related industries.

China’s Solar Boom Surpasses U.S. Nuclear

China’s solar industry has experienced an explosive rise. In early 2025, monthly solar generation surged past 125 terawatt-hours (TWh)—a more than fivefold increase since 2018. For perspective, this figure is now higher than the steady 65–75 TWh per month produced by the entire U.S. nuclear fleet.

This is a symbolic turning point. For decades, nuclear power was the gold standard for large-scale, carbon-free electricity. Today, China’s solar farms produce more clean power on a monthly basis than America’s entire nuclear sector. The gap is expected to widen, as China continues adding record-breaking solar capacity each year.

Solar growth has been so steep that it is no longer just about meeting household or industrial demand. China is producing extra electricity. This allows it to power energy-demanding technologies like AI, cloud services, and electric vehicles. This “overbuilding” strategy ensures that when demand spikes, the grid has capacity ready.

In the first half of 2025, China’s solar installations more than doubled from a year earlier. This surge meant China added over twice the solar capacity of all other countries combined. The country now accounts for 67% of global installations, up from 54% in the same period of 2024.

RELATED: Renewable Energy Investment Reaches Record High as China Operates World’s Biggest Solar Farm

Two Strategies, Two Futures: Beijing vs. Washington

A side-by-side comparison of energy goals shows just how far apart the two countries are in their approaches.

Solar and Wind Capacity (2025): China is on track for 1,400 GW, while the U.S. will reach only about 350 GW.

New Additions in 2025: China plans to add 212 GW of solar and 51 GW of wind, compared to less than 100 GW combined in the U.S.

Mega Projects: China is developing multi-gigawatt solar bases in deserts and multiple 100+ GW wind farms. The U.S.’s largest solar project—Gemini in Nevada—is just 690 MW, or less than 0.7 GW.

Offshore Wind: China already has 42.7 GW installed, compared with the U.S.’s Empire Wind project (816 MW phase 1, with a potential expansion to 2.1 GW).

The comparison reveals a structural difference. China views clean energy as national infrastructure, central to its industrial policy. The U.S., meanwhile, relies more heavily on market incentives and tax credits, which can shift with each administration.

Nuclear Power: The Long Game

China’s clean energy dominance is not limited to solar and wind. Nuclear power is becoming a core pillar of its long-term strategy.

As of 2025, China operates about 58 GW of nuclear power capacity, compared to 94 GW in the United States. At first glance, this seems like a smaller footprint, but the forward-looking numbers tell a different story.

China has more than 30 GW of nuclear capacity under construction, representing over half of the world’s current nuclear buildout. By comparison, U.S. nuclear growth is limited to incremental projects, with little in the way of large-scale expansion.

Looking ahead:

2030 Goal: China is targeting 200 GW of nuclear, while U.S. projections range from 100–110 GW.

2050 Vision: China aims for 500 GW of nuclear capacity, compared to the U.S.’s ambitious but unfunded target of 400 GW.

Nuclear offers China two critical advantages. First, it provides reliable baseload electricity, balancing out the intermittency of solar and wind. It also provides a secure, carbon-free power supply. This is crucial for industries that need constant electricity, like AI supercomputing, semiconductor fabs, and robotics manufacturing.

Mega Projects That Redraw the Energy Map

China’s energy expansion is not just about adding capacity; it’s about reshaping the global map of mega energy projects. Some of the most ambitious include:

Xinjiang Desert Solar Farm: A 3.5 GW solar base, one of the largest in the world, leveraging the region’s vast open land and high sunlight exposure.

Hundred-Gigawatt Wind Clusters: Multiple projects, each scaling over 100 GW, dwarf anything currently planned in other countries.

Hydropower Expansion: With over $170 billion invested, China is pursuing new gigaprojects, unlike the U.S., which is focused only on modernizing existing dams.

These projects are not built in isolation. They connect to ultra-high-voltage transmission lines, ensuring that clean electricity from remote areas flows to coastal cities, industrial parks, and increasingly, to massive data centers.

Energy and AI: The Hidden Race Behind Algorithms

The global AI race is about algorithms and chips as well as energy. Training large-scale AI models requires massive amounts of electricity. Data centers using these systems now consume power like small countries. By the end of this decade, their demand is set to triple.

China’s decision to overbuild renewables and expand nuclear capacity is directly linked to this future. By ensuring a surplus of clean, low-cost energy, China is preparing to host the next generation of AI clusters, robotics hubs, and cloud infrastructure.

U.S. Policy Uncertainty: A Strategic Weakness

While China pushes ahead, U.S. clean energy growth faces obstacles. Policy shifts and partisan battles have slowed momentum. Proposals to roll back tax credits or defund renewable energy research could reduce investor confidence and stall growth.

As one observer, Laurie Garrett, noted:

“By blocking and de-funding alternative energy R&D and tax incentives for use of solar, wind, nuclear and other renewables, Trump is handing the future on a gold platter to China.”

This concern is not just about climate. It’s about competitiveness. If the U.S. can’t boost energy capacity to meet growing AI and industrial needs, it may lose its leadership in key sectors. These sectors will shape global influence in the coming decades.

Clean Energy as the New Industrial Edge

China’s renewable and nuclear surge is reshaping the balance of global power. With solar generation now surpassing U.S. nuclear, nuclear projects expanding faster than anywhere else, and gigaprojects rising across deserts, mountains, and coastlines, China is ensuring it has the energy backbone for the AI-driven future.

The U.S. still retains advantages in innovation, advanced nuclear designs, and private-sector dynamism. But without consistent policy support and accelerated project deployment, it risks falling behind.

With regulatory tailwinds, federal incentives, and a clear alignment with decarbonization trends, Georgia Power’s initiatives not only address rising energy demand but also position Southern Company as a leader in the clean energy transition.

Regulatory Tailwinds: Policy-Driven Momentum

Georgia Power’s 2025 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP), approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission (PSC), underscores a $2.3 billion investment in renewable energy and grid modernization from 2023 to 2025 [1]. This includes procuring up to 4,000 MW of new solar and battery storage by 2035, with 1,100 MW of new resources targeted through competitive bidding [2]. Regulatory approvals for these projects are critical, as they ensure cost recovery and rate stability for customers while enabling Southern Company to capitalize on long-term cash flows.

Federal incentives further amplify this momentum. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) provides a 30% investment tax credit (ITC) for solar and energy storage systems through 2032, reducing upfront costs and enhancing project viability [3]. Georgia Power has also secured regulatory flexibility to opt out of certain IRS tax normalization requirements, allowing it to accelerate ITC recognition [1]. These policy-driven advantages create a predictable financial environment, mitigating risks for investors.

Financial Metrics: ROI and Cost Savings

The financial case for Georgia Power’s solar projects is bolstered by robust returns. A 2025 study of a 100 MW solar project in Pakistan—a comparable large-scale initiative—revealed a payback period of 5.6 years and a net present value (NPV) of $31.7 million over 25 years [4]. While regional differences exist, Georgia’s access to the 30% ITC and falling solar installation costs (now $3–$5 per watt pre-incentive [5]) suggest similarly attractive returns.

For commercial projects, the combination of the ITC and 100% bonus depreciation under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act can yield payback periods as short as five years and internal rates of return (IRR) exceeding 10% [3]. Residential solar adoption in Georgia, though less capital-intensive, also benefits from these incentives, with households saving 20%–25% on electricity costs over a system’s lifetime [6]. These metrics highlight solar’s scalability and its potential to drive Southern Company’s profitability.

Decarbonization Alignment: A Strategic Imperative

Georgia Power’s renewable targets align with national decarbonization goals. The utility plans to add 11,000 MW of renewable capacity by 2035, including 1,500 MW of battery storage, while uprating carbon-free nuclear units at Plants Hatch and Vogtle [2]. This diversified approach—balancing solar, storage, and nuclear—ensures reliability amid the intermittency of renewables, addressing a key concern for regulators and investors.

The broader industry context reinforces this strategy. Solar has been the leading source of new U.S. electricity generation in recent years, driven by declining costs and federal policies [7]. Georgia Power’s 2025 IRP also anticipates 8,500 MW of load growth by 2030, driven by data centers and EV manufacturing, necessitating a resilient grid [2]. By integrating 1,000+ miles of new transmission lines and modernizing existing infrastructure, Georgia Power is future-proofing its operations against demand shocks.

Shareholder Value: Growth and Stability

For Southern Company shareholders, Georgia Power’s renewable expansion offers dual benefits: growth from new revenue streams and stability from regulated returns. The utility’s $2.3 billion capital investment program from 2023 to 2025 [1] signals confidence in long-term cash flow generation, while its focus on low-cost solar and storage reduces exposure to volatile fossil fuel markets.

Moreover, Southern Company’s nuclear investments—such as the recent commercial operation of Plant Vogtle Unit 4 [8]—provide a hedge against renewable intermittency and position the company to benefit from production tax credits (PTC) for zero-carbon energy [9]. This hybrid model of nuclear, solar, and storage aligns with investor preferences for diversified, low-risk portfolios.

Conclusion

Southern Company’s strategic renewable expansion, led by Georgia Power’s solar initiatives, is a masterclass in leveraging regulatory and financial tailwinds. With a clear roadmap for decarbonization, robust ROI metrics, and a diversified energy mix, the company is not only meeting the demands of a growing Georgia but also securing its position as a clean energy leader. For shareholders, this translates to a compelling combination of growth, stability, and alignment with global sustainability trends—a recipe for long-term value creation.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-06 04:58:32.410855

The company is undertaking a reduction of approximately 1.5% of its workforce, impacting less than 15,000 employees globally—the total number reported at the close of the prior year.

These workforce changes are primarily targeted at enhancing the operational efficiency of Rivian's commercial team, which oversees sales and service operations. The company has extended support to affected employees, encouraging them to seek alternative roles within the organization's open positions.

Rivian is set to commence production of the R2 model at its manufacturing plant in Normal, Illinois. This new model represents a strategic pivot toward more affordable electric vehicles, aiming to widen its market reach and garner greater demand. The R2 SUV, priced competitively at approximately $45,000, positions itself as a more accessible option compared to Rivian's prior models, including the R1T pickup and the R1S SUV.

In the face of policy shifts impacting the electric vehicle sector, Rivian is navigating economic pressures that have necessitated workforce adjustments. The expiration of a $7,500 federal tax credit for EV buyers and stringent fuel economy regulations are adding layers of complexity for Rivian and its peers. These recent developments are poised to affect revenue streams associated with credit sales to other automakers, potentially delaying up to $100 million in expected income.

Despite the economic challenges, Rivian maintains that it possesses adequate financial reserves to support the forthcoming launch of the R2 model, highlighting this new vehicle as a critical element in its strategy to achieve profitability. Analysts believe that the success of the R2 could herald a turning point, fostering increased adoption among mainstream consumers. Rivian's financial loss of $1.1 billion reported in the second quarter underscores the urgency of its transition towards a broader customer base.

The R2 SUV's launch is thus a pivotal moment for Rivian, with the company's future resting partly on the vehicle's reception in the marketplace. While analysts predict enhanced demand for this model, they emphasize cautious optimism. Rivian remains focused on streamlining its operations and managing expenses as it strives to solidify its standing as a key player in the evolving electric vehicle landscape.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-06 12:05:27.028234

An August 23 referendum on restarting Taiwan’s Third Nuclear Power Plant failed to pass, bringing the island’s energy security concerns back into focus. As Taiwan strives to be a global hub for tech manufacturing, reliable energy supplies are vital to maintaining its edge in chipmaking and artificial intelligence (AI). In addition, the more than four million votes cast in favour of restarting the plant highlight public anxiety over Taiwan’s energy vulnerability — anxiety that could push leaders to revisit the island’s nuclear-free policy or risk losing votes in the 2028 presidential election.

Canada, already a major player in Taiwan’s offshore wind sector, could bring its nuclear expertise to bear in strengthening the island’s energy security, if Taipei were to revive atomic power.

In Brief

In May, the opposition Kuomintang and Taiwan People’s Party, which together hold a legislative majority, backed a referendum to restart Taiwan’s third nuclear power plant, arguing that the island could reduce dependence on imported fuel and ensure its own energy supply.

The Maanshan Nuclear Power Plant, located on the island’s southern tip, was taken offlinethe same month as part of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party’s (DPP) pledge to phase out all of Taiwan’s nuclear power programs, which once met more than half of the island’s energy needs. Taiwan originally had three nuclear plants, which were shut between 2014 and 2025. Maanshan was the final plant to close.

Roughly 4.3 millionTaiwanese voted in favour of reopening the plant, vastly outnumbering the 1.5 million who voted against it. However, under referendum rules, a motion must secure the support of at least one quarter of Taiwan’s 20 million registered voters — around five million — to pass. By law, the same issue cannot be brought to a referendum again for another two years.

In response to the plebiscite, President Lai Ching-te left the door open to Taiwan reconsidering nuclear technology in the future if safety conditions are met.

Implications

Taiwan’s energy depends on imports, while renewables lag. The island imports more than 95 per cent of its energy. In 2024, liquefied natural gas (LNG) was the leading source of power generation, at over 40 per cent, while renewables accounted for only 13 per cent — well short of the government’s 20 per cent target. Power outages have become increasingly frequent.

Taiwan’s energy crunch could undermine its advanced technology leadership. The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), which produces 90 per cent of the world’s most advanced chips for clients such as Apple and Nvidia, uses nine per cent of Taiwan’s total electricity output. That share is set to expand. In 2021, a seven-hour blackout at TSMC’s Tainan plant directly disrupted production of TSMC’s 40-nanometre chip production. With an AI boom estimated to drive a 12-13 per cent increase in power demand by 2030, such energy shortages will continue to be a serious risk not only to the viability of Taiwan’s long-term tech leadership, but also to the global supply of advanced chips amid surging AI demand.

For Taiwan, energy security is also a chokepoint security issue. If Beijing were to launch a blockade of Taiwan, the island's limited reserves of natural gas and its reliance on imported energy would be critical vulnerabilities. Chinese military drills have already simulated blockades of Taiwan’s LNG gateways, with estimates suggesting that the island’s LNG supplies could be depleted within 10 days. Analysts warn China could also target Taiwan’s power grid, mirroring tactics Russia has employed in Ukraine.

However, restarting the Maanshan Plant runsthe risk of a Fukushima-like leak. Such an incident would have severe environmental consequences for the earthquake-prone region where the Maanshan plant is located. However, the high number of the referendum’s voters who were in favour of the plant’s reopening seems to indicate a shift in public opinion: a similar referendum in 2021 to restart the construction of two mothballed reactors at Lungmen faced 51 per cent opposition versus 47 per cent support. While the same proposal will not return for at least another two years, public anxiety could mean that the debate about nuclear energy remains active.

What’s Next

1. Nuclear remains difficult question for DPP

This failed — yet majority-backed — referendum underscores pressure on the Lai government to revisit the DPP’s ideological commitment to a “nuclear-free homeland.” If the DPP does not address the island’s lagging renewable development — and the public’s mounting concerns over a stable energy supply — the party’s support could take a hit in the 2028 presidential election.

2. Deepening Canada–Taiwan energy partnerships

Canada has emerged as a promising partner in Taiwan’s energy diversification, with Canadian investment in the island’s offshore wind projects having the potential to power over one million households. As Canada exports its first shipment of LNG in July to Asian markets, Taiwan is eyeing opportunities for collaboration, both in terms of investment and imports. Meanwhile, should Taiwan revisit its stance on nuclear power, Canada could contribute its full spectrum of capabilities, from fuel production to advanced reactor technologies, including the G7’s first small modular reactor with enhanced safety features. The Canadian Trade Gateway for Nuclear Development, announced as part of Ottawa’s 2022 Indo-Pacific Strategy, signals Canada’s commitment to sharing expertise and best practices in nuclear technology to help partners meet their clean energy needs.

It views this development as an innovation addressing a pressing bottleneck in the battery industry: safe, efficient and automated disassembly.
Recirculate says the system is designed to dismantle batteries in two key phases—from battery pack to module, and from module to cell level.
“We’ve trained a machine learning model to locate and identify each screw, extract their exact coordinates and send this data to the robot.
“This is one of the first working, real-world examples of battery disassembly using machine learning and robotics,” Pitkäaho says.","Recirculate, a European Union-funded project based in Finland, says it is developing a “state-of-the-art” electric vehicle (EV) battery disassembly system using artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics.

Project leadership says it has successfully completed its first phase: the creation of a set of tools and machine learning models for the robotic dismantling of an EV battery from pack to cell level. It views this development as an innovation addressing a pressing bottleneck in the battery industry: safe, efficient and automated disassembly.

Recirculate says the system is designed to dismantle batteries in two key phases—from battery pack to module, and from module to cell level. Centria University of Applied Science’s team is leading work on this development within Recirculate and created a purpose-built robotic cell using a KUKA KR10 industrial robot. Recirculate says the robot, equipped with specially designed tools and a mobile linear track, can autonomously detect, unscrew and remove components of high-voltage battery packs.

“There are approximately 50 screws on the lid alone,” says Tomi Pitkäaho, principal lecturer in research, Centria University of Applied Science. “We’ve trained a machine learning model to locate and identify each screw, extract their exact coordinates and send this data to the robot. With a depth camera installed directly on the tool, the robot can precisely determine not just the ‘x’ and ‘y’ position, but also the z-depth for each component.”

Recirculate says the system uses multiple machine learning models to identify and extract critical components including screws, connectors and wiring. Once the lid is removed using a vacuum gripper, specialized robotic tools are used to dismantle internal components. The models not only recognize the elements but also analyze wire orientations to determine optimal disassembly strategies.

“We’ve developed tools that can detect and manipulate parts with remarkable precision,” Pitkäaho says. “From training datasets to model architecture and deployment, it took 18 months of dedicated work by our team of robotics, AI and ML [machine learning] experts.”

Beyond disassembly, Recirculate says its team has created a battery identification model that can recognize batteries eve in the absence of QR codes or digital product passports. Currently, project participants claim the model can identify battery types from manufacturers such as Ford and Tesla with nearly 100 percent accuracy, enabling the system to automatically select the correct disassembly program.

“This is one of the first working, real-world examples of battery disassembly using machine learning and robotics,” Pitkäaho says. “Until now, most efforts have been purely academic. We’re proud to bring this into industrial application through Recirculate.”

The project team says it is focused on expanding its proprietary training dataset in order to scale the solution and extend its compatibility to other battery types.",https://www.recyclingtoday.com/fileuploads/image/2025/09/05/recirculate_robot_disassembly-web.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 14:03:29.848586

Attorneys General William Tong of Connecticut and Peter Neronha of Rhode Island announced Thursday that they’ll file suit in Rhode Island federal court to overturn the August 22 stop-work order from the Bureau of Ocean and Energy Management (BOEM). The order abruptly shut down construction without citing any violation of law or safety threats. Instead, BOEM vaguely referred to “concerns” under its Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act authority, offering no explanation.

Revolution Wind is 15 nautical miles off Rhode Island and expected to come online in 2026. Once complete, the $6 billion project would supply 350,000 homes with electricity and save ratepayers in Connecticut and Rhode Island hundreds of millions of dollars over 20 years. The project supports more than 2,500 jobs across the US, including over 1,000 union construction jobs, and has already cleared every required state and federal review. Construction is already 80% complete.

The lawsuit, to be filed against the Department of the Interior, BOEM, and their nominated leaders, argues that the stop-work order violates the Administrative Procedure Act and the agency’s authority under OCSLA. The complaint says the government’s action is arbitrary, capricious, and undermines both states’ legal and financial commitments.

“Revolution Wind is fully permitted, nearly complete, and months from providing enough American-made, clean, affordable energy to power 350,000 homes. Now, with zero justification, Trump wants to mothball the project, send workers home, and saddle Connecticut families with millions of dollars in higher energy costs,” Tong said. “This kind of erratic and reckless governing is blatantly illegal, and we’re suing to stop it.”

Neronha added, “With Revolution Wind, we have an opportunity to create good-paying jobs for Rhode Islanders, enhance energy reliability, and ensure energy cost savings while protecting our environment. And yet, this stop-work order is not even the latest development in this administration’s all-out assault on wind energy. Just yesterday, we learned of reports that the Administration is pulling in staff from several different unrelated federal agencies, including Health and Human Services, to do its bidding. This is bizarre, this is unlawful, this is potentially devastating, and we won’t stand by and watch it happen.”

Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont said the administration has offered no explanation nearly two weeks after the order. “We hoped to work with the Administration to lower energy costs, strengthen grid reliability, create jobs, and drive economic growth, but only if they share those goals. But if they do not, we will act to preserve this vital project and protect the energy future of Connecticut and the entire New England region,” he said.

Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) called the shutdown “insane, illogical, and illegal,” while Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) said, “The Revolution Wind project has already made it through exhaustive reviews by multiple federal agencies, and I doubt Trump’s flimsy excuses for scuttling this project will stand up to legal scrutiny.”

Danish renewables developer Ørsted, which owns a 50% share in Revolution Wind, also announced Thursday that it’s suing the Trump administration in a bid to restart construction on the blocked wind farm.

Rhode Island and Connecticut have said that halting construction of Revolution Wind would harm the states, their residents, investments and the offshore wind industry.","PROVIDENCE, R.I. — Connecticut, Rhode Island and the developer of an offshore wind farm that would power 350,000 homes in the two states said Thursday that they’re suing the Trump administration for stopping the nearly completed project.

Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha accused President Donald Trump of waging an “all-out assault” on the wind energy industry. The states’ lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Rhode Island, describes the Revolution Wind project as a “cornerstone” of their clean energy future, abruptly halted by federal officials without “statutory authority, regulatory justification or factual basis.”

Danish energy company Orsted filed a separate suit in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., also arguing that the administration lacks the legal authority to block the Revolution Wind project. Orsted said it would seek a preliminary injunction that would allow it to move forward with the project, which is 80% complete, with all underwater foundations and 45 of 65 turbines installed.

Interior Department spokesperson Elizabeth Peace said Thursday that the department doesn’t comment on pending litigation.

Work on the project was paused Aug. 22 when the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management issued a stop work order for what it said were national security concerns. It did not specify those concerns.

Trump has been hostile to renewable energy, particularly offshore wind, and prioritizes fossil fuels for electricity. Revolution Wind is the second major wind project that his administration ordered to stop work. The first, an offshore wind project for New York, was later allowed to resume construction.

In separate recent federal court filings, the administration said it was reconsidering approvals for three other wind farms: the Maryland Offshore Wind Project, SouthCoast Wind and New England Wind. Combined, those projects could power nearly 2.5 million homes in Maryland, Massachusetts and Rhode Island with clean electricity.

Democratic Sens. Ed Markey and Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, said Trump and his Cabinet “need to end their war on American energy and jobs.”

‘Swarm drone attacks’ cited as a reason for stopping work

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum told CNN that he’s concerned offshore wind turbines distort radar detection systems, which could give cover to a bad actor to “launch a swarm drone attack through a wind farm.”

Retired U.S. Navy Cmdr. Kirk Lippold called that a “specious and false narrative” pushed by someone with an “overactive imagination in search of a solution to a problem that doesn’t exist.” Lippold was commanding the USS Cole when al-Qaida attacked it in a Yemeni port in 2000.

If drones get that close to U.S. shores to be near a wind farm without being detected by the military, he said, “we have had a massive intelligence — a national security — failure.”

U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat and national security expert, has also disputed the administration’s rationale, pointing to the Defense Department’s involvement in reviewing the project.

When it approved Revolution Wind in 2023, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said it consulted with the Defense Department at each stage of the regulatory process for the lease area assigned to the wind farm. The DOD concluded that with some site-specific stipulations, any impacts to its training and activities in the wind energy area would be “negligible and avoidable,” according to the record of decision.

The state and federal reviews took about nine years.

Trump and several Cabinet members repeatedly slammed wind power as ugly and expensive during last week’s Cabinet meeting. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. talked about the failure of a massive wind turbine blade at a different offshore wind farm under construction off Nantucket, Massachusetts.

Fiberglass fragments of a blade from the Vineyard Wind project broke apart and began washing ashore last summer during the peak of tourist season. Manufacturer GE Vernova agreed to pay $10.5 million in a settlement to compensate island businesses that suffered losses due to the blade failure.

Kennedy’s family famously opposed an earlier failed wind project not far from the family’s Cape Cod estate.

Trump said, “We’re not allowing any windmills to go up unless there’s a legal situation where somebody committed to it a long time ago.”

Wind farm was on track to deliver power in 2026

Revolution Wind was expected to be Rhode Island’s and Connecticut’s first large offshore wind farm, capable of providing about 2.5% of the region’s electricity needs.

Orsted began construction in 2024 about 15 miles south of the Rhode Island coast. It says in its complaint that about $5 billion has been spent or committed, and it expects more than $1 billion in costs if the project is canceled. Rhode Island is already home to one offshore wind farm, the five-turbine Block Island Wind Farm.

Rhode Island and Connecticut have said that halting construction of Revolution Wind would harm the states, their residents, investments and the offshore wind industry. More than 1,000 people have been working on the wind farm, and Connecticut committed over $200 million to redevelop State Pier in New London to support the industry.

The states said they’re counting on the electricity from Revolution Wind, particularly in the winter, when demand in New England spikes and natural gas is prioritized for heating. The power would cost 9.8 cents per kilowatt-hour, locked in for 20 years. That’s cheaper than the average projected cost of energy in New England.

The head of Connecticut’s top environmental and energy agency, Katie Dykes, predicts it will cost the state’s electricity ratepayers tens of millions of dollars if the wind project doesn’t come online. She also noted the risk to electricity reliability in New England cited by the region’s independent system operator.

From St. James to Cameron Parish, environmental justice organizations have dragged parish commissions, global corporations and state agencies into court.

One group, The Descendants Project, a nonprofit based in St. John the Baptist Parish, has filed at least three lawsuits in recent years over a Formosa Plastics zoning dispute. One targeted the parish government itself, while the other targeted Formosa. A third lawsuit related to the same dispute was filed against the Port of South Louisiana.

The disputed zoning change, passed unanimously in 1990, reclassified land in Wallace from residential to heavy industrial. The Descendants Project says the move was tainted by corruption tied to then-Parish President Lester Millet and aimed at benefiting Formosa Plastics.

The land is home to the graves of former enslaved Blacks. Their names were Simon, Betsy, Rachel, Stanley and Harry.

In July, The Descendants Project and Inclusive Louisiana filed suit against Formosa, saying that Formosa is violating the 13th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution by owning and controlling the bodies.

While such lawsuits are sometimes well intentioned, they are “at least in part by a desire simply to burden the defendant or the defendant’s industry in some way,” said Robert Stilson of the Capital Research Center. “This might be through causing delays or increased costs, scoring public relations points, or attempting to achieve through litigation what those activists have been unable to achieve through legislation”

The Descendants Project also sued the Port of South Louisiana, accusing its board of secretly predetermining a vote on Greenfield’s grain elevator deal through email – a violation, they allege, of the state’s open meetings law.

Many of the lawsuits across the state include the same groups.

RISE St. James, Inclusive Louisiana, and the Mount Triumph Baptist Church, represented by the Tulane University Environmental Law Clinic, are pressing their case against St. James Parish and Koch. Koch and parish officials have asked the Louisiana Supreme Court to shut the case down and revive approvals for an expansion at Koch’s methanol plant.

The same three groups, also represented by Tulane, have a separate lawsuit against the parish saying it “discriminates against them by directing hazardous industrial facility development towards majority-Black districts and Black churches, where their members and congregants live.”

And just last week, another front opened in Cameron Parish, as reported by The Advocate. The Louisiana Bucket Brigade, Sierra Club, and Environmental Integrity Project filed suit against the state Department of Environmental Quality for granting Venture Global a permit to build its Calcasieu Pass 2 liquefied natural gas facility.

“This company has been a bad neighbor and continually pollutes the air we breathe, while generating billions of dollars in profits,” resident and Sierra Club member John Allaire said in announcing the lawsuit.

The Sierra Club chapter of Louisiana, an environmental lobbying and legal group, has a long list of ongoing litigation against various big businesses.

“It’s disappointing to see nationally-backed activists try to litigate their agenda instead of working with local communities to understand the positive impact U.S. LNG brings to Louisiana and the world,” Venture Global wrote The Center Square in a statement.

The Bucket Brigade has also turned its firepower on New Orleans, suing the city and a development district in 2024 over a tax break deal for Shell Oil. The group says it was rushed through illegally and unfairly shifted tax burdens onto residents.

Taken together, the lawsuits reflect the strategy of a small but interconnected network of nonprofit groups that have reshaped environmental battles in south Louisiana.

The Descendants Project and Inclusive Louisiana have focused on challenging heavy industry expansion in St. John and St. James parishes, where descendants of enslaved people live in neighborhoods overshadowed by industrial development.

The Bucket Brigade has become one of the most visible opponents of industry in “Cancer Alley,” winning national recognition for forcing the cancellation of projects like the billion-dollar Wanhua chemical plant.

The Bucket Brigade, founded more than 20 years ago, has broadened its reach from oil refineries to liquefied natural gas export terminals, running campaigns that identify and train local residents to speak before federal regulators, track accidents, and rally community resistance.

In its filings, the group says it is building an “early warning network” across parishes most targeted for industrial growth, particularly majority-Black communities in St. James and St. John.

Some of these nonprofits are being bankrolled by an out-of-state foundation with an ironic stake in Big Oil. The Elizabeth B. and Arthur E. Roswell Foundation Inc., which as of 2023 held more than 6,800 shares of BP stock, has poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into Louisiana’s grassroots groups.

Tax records show the Roswell Foundation gave $33,000 to the Descendants Project, $76,000 to the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, and tens of thousands more to groups like Jubilee Justice in Alexandria, Rural Roots Louisiana, and Voice of the Experienced.

The foundation committed even larger future payments, including $90,000 to the Descendants Project, $120,000 to the Bucket Brigade, and $120,000 to Rural Roots Louisiana.

Cancer rates in Louisiana are among the highest in the nation and are often attributed to irresponsible business practices in the petrochemical industry, which has a massive presence in Louisiana.

These organizations were “founded by and serving the descendant community of enslaved people who forcibly worked and died on plantations in the parishes along the Mississippi River in Louisiana under the cruel and inhumane system of slavery in the U.S. South,” one lawsuit states.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/e0/8e075607-daf4-426f-bc76-eba0b9b7ac11/685b0a67662a7.image.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 15:04:03.185561

CAMILA DOMONOSKE, BYLINE: Hi.

DETROW: What do we know about this workplace raid so far?

DOMONOSKE: Yeah. So Homeland Security Investigations, which is the branch of ICE that carries out this kind of workplace raid, they say that they detained 475 people, most of them South Korean. Hyundai and LG Energy Solutions - both of those companies are headquartered in South Korea. Here's Special Agent Steven Schrank speaking at a press conference.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

STEVEN SCHRANK: Some that illegally crossed the border into the United States, some that came in through visa waiver and were prohibited from working, some that had visas and overstayed their visas.

DETROW: So who was employing the people who were detained?

DOMONOSKE: It's a good question. You know, in a project like this, there are really complicated webs of subcontractors and subcontractors to subcontractors. Hyundai says that it believes that nobody detained was directly employed by Hyundai Motor Company. LG Energy Solutions hasn't responded to NPR's requests for comment.

That Homeland Security official said that this raid was tied to, quote, ""allegations of unlawful employment practices and serious federal crimes,"" end quote. He did not provide more details on that, and there are no charges filed in this case right now. Officials say this is an ongoing investigation. It would be unusual if charges are eventually filed because immigration raids like this, where workers are detained - they don't often end with criminal charges for employers.

DETROW: Tell us more about where this raid happened.

DOMONOSKE: It's on this huge campus of buildings near Savannah, Georgia, that also includes a large factory where Hyundai is right now building electric vehicles. That factory was not directly affected by the raid. Production of vehicles didn't actually stop. But the battery plant that's under construction nearby, which is where the raid actually happened - it's an important part of the long-term plans for this facility 'cause the goal is to build not just electric vehicles, but the whole supply chain for these vehicles here in the U.S.

And that's important not just to Hyundai, but actually to the United States more broadly in this effort to try to compete with China over the future of electric vehicles. So Hyundai is investing some $26 billion in moving manufacturing to the U.S., including this project. It's a big deal for the company and for Georgia. The state's called it the largest economic development project in state history.

DETROW: And I understand you just heard back from Hyundai. What did they say?

DOMONOSKE: They said they're going to conduct an investigation into suppliers and their subcontractors to make sure they are all following employment law and other laws and regulations. Meanwhile, Congressman Buddy Carter, who represents the area surrounding the plant, posted on X that he applauded the Trump administration for taking bold action. And the South Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs says it voiced concerns to the United States about respecting South Korean economic activity and citizens.

In the two decades since Hurricane Katrina, Entergy has worked alongside local partners to invest in clean energy, financial empowerment, and economic development, creating pathways to prosperity for Gulf South communities while preparing them for a stronger, more sustainable future.

When Entergy rebuilds, it extends beyond poles and wires; it’s about building the community back stronger – whether equipping schools with solar panels, creating 130 miles of bike lanes or replanting almost 100,000 trees wiped out by the storm.

The company has also made significant investments in solar energy, energy efficiency, and grid resilience, ensuring that families, schools, and businesses have access to power that is affordable, reliable, and clean.

John Weiss, Entergy’s Vice President of Sustainability and Environmental Policy.

For more than twenty years, Entergy shareholders have invested nearly $44 million in environmentally beneficial projects and programs through the Environmental Initiatives Fund. The fund identifies projects or programs throughout Entergy’s service area that improve the environment by reducing emissions, protecting natural resources and restoring wetlands and forests. In the wake of hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the fund supported local organizations that made a big impact on the communities Entergy calls home. From coastal restoration to sustainable parade throws, Entergy’s support helped deliver real results.

Grounds Krewe, a nonprofit organization focused on waste prevention, is working to increase recycling efforts and expand the use of eco-friendly parade throws and consumable goods. “With continued support from Entergy’s Environmental Initiative Fund, the Entergy Charitable Foundation, and hundreds of volunteer hours from their staff, our non-profit has been able to provide over 760,000 eco-friendly, functional throw alternatives to Mardi Gras Krewes and divert 112,000 pounds of material from the landfill through parade recycling initiatives,” says Brett Davis, director of Grounds Krewe. “Entergy’s help was fundamental in getting us off the ground and has kept our programs thriving.”

These efforts are grounded in Entergy’s climate action plan, which includes a goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Through renewable energy, advanced battery storage, and smarter grid technology, Entergy is shaping a future where sustainability benefits everyone. Importantly, these innovations also create economic opportunities. By training local workers to install, maintain, and manage renewable energy infrastructure, Entergy connects environmental progress directly to jobs and workforce development, ensuring that economic growth and sustainability move forward together.

Just as Entergy invests in cleaner energy, it also empowers families to build financial stability and create generational wealth. Through partnerships with United Way of Southeast Louisiana, Entergy supports Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) centers, helping families claim the refunds and tax credits they deserve. From 2011 through 2024, Entergy volunteers have helped refund more than $354 million in earned income tax credits to customers across its system, with nearly half of those refunds going to Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans customers. Entergy’s pro bono

legal program also assists residents in securing critical documents related to housing, helping them retain home ownership and access rebuilding funds – work that has had a transformative and generational impact on families across the region. Over the past decade, Entergy’s dedicated legal team has contributed more than 22,000 hours of pro bono work, resulting in a $6.1 million in-kind donation to the communities Entergy serves.

“Entergy’s dedicated pro bono volunteers have played a pivotal role in helping families retain their homes, guiding them through the process of securing essential paperwork to access rebuilding funds and foster family wealth,” said Christy Kane, Entergy Pro Bono Counsel. “This initiative not only bolsters economic stability within our region but, more importantly, provides immense relief to community members who can finally claim legal ownership of family homes.

Christy shared one particularly moving story: “One woman told me that locking the door at night now brings her peace, knowing her grandmother’s home is finally in her name. That sense of security ensures her family’s legacy will live on.”

Kane was recently selected as a Daily Point of Light Award honoree for her pro bono work with Entergy by the Points of Light organization, an organization that honors U.S. companies that prioritize giving back, empowering volunteer work and creating sustainable community programs. Working on issues like these reinforces how personal this work can be for Kane, and everyone at Entergy.

Beyond helping families secure their homes, Entergy also extends its commitment to strengthening the Gulf South by supporting local businesses and fostering economic opportunities. Through mentorship programs, contracting partnerships, and financial tools, Entergy helps entrepreneurs grow their businesses and contribute to a thriving Gulf South economy.

From reducing energy costs and strengthening infrastructure to supporting families and small businesses, Entergy’s work reflects a vision where environmental progress, economic empowerment, and community resilience are all connected.

Twenty years after Katrina, the company continues to partner with communities to create pathways from recovery to renewal, ensuring that the Gulf South’s future is one of strength, opportunity, and shared prosperity.

Those restrictions could effectively prevent the expansion of National Monuments, National Conservation Areas, Wild and Scenic Rivers, and National Scenic and Historic Trails administered by the BLM.
The order would also allow states to use the conservation fund to buy federal property, including protected federal conservation land.
The Land and Water Conservation Fund has pumped more than $175 million into acquiring and improving public land at Red Rock Canyon and Lake Tahoe, according to the Nevada Conservation League.
Local conservation groups warned the restrictions could prevent new investments in the outdoor recreation economy and halt pending land deals and projects.","The Department of the Interior announced plans Thursday to reshape a popular conservation program that uses offshore oil royalties to support conservation projects, including narrowing the ways those funds can be spent.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum issued an order guiding the allocation of more than $430 million from the Land and Water Conservation Fund to projects that would “benefit wildlife habitat, improve water quality and provide flood protection while creating new recreational opportunities.”

“The Land and Water Conservation Fund continues to deliver on its promise to connect Americans to the outdoors while protecting the landscapes that make our nation special,” said Burgum in a statement.

But local conservation groups say the changes threaten to undermine the bipartisan Great American Outdoors Act (GAOA) that President Donald Trump signed into law in 2020, which contributes hundreds of millions of dollars to the development and rehabilitation of parks, conservation areas and outdoor recreation facilities across the nation.

Conservation groups said language in the order restricts the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) from using the fund to acquire additional land that could be used to expand recreation and conservation.

Those restrictions could effectively prevent the expansion of National Monuments, National Conservation Areas, Wild and Scenic Rivers, and National Scenic and Historic Trails administered by the BLM.

“Nevada is approximately 86% public land, of which 67% is managed by the Bureau of Land Management. If you have enjoyed some form of outdoor recreation in Nevada, there is a good chance it was on BLM managed land. If you have camped, hiked, OHV’ed or hunted in Nevada, it was likely in or near a National Conservation Area or National Monument,” said Russell Kuhlman, executive director of the Nevada Wildlife Federation.

The order would also allow states to use the conservation fund to buy federal property, including protected federal conservation land. Those changes could open the door to land transfers that shift public land to private ownership, said the Nevada Conservation League.

“Nevadans overwhelmingly support protecting these places, and we cannot afford to roll back decades of progress in opening and protecting access to the great outdoors,” said Kristee Watson, Executive Director of the Nevada Conservation League.

The Land and Water Conservation Fund has pumped more than $175 million into acquiring and improving public land at Red Rock Canyon and Lake Tahoe, according to the Nevada Conservation League.

The order also “increased bureaucratic red tape” by requiring both state governors and local county officials to approve land acquisitions purchased using the fund, said the Nevada Wildlife Federation.

Local conservation groups warned the restrictions could prevent new investments in the outdoor recreation economy and halt pending land deals and projects.

In 2023, Nevada’s outdoor recreation industry accounted for $8.1 billion in value-added (GDP) annually, ranking the state 10th in the nation, according to the Nevada Division of Outdoor Recreation.

The Department of the Interior did, however, back away from earlier plans to include language that would siphon money away from conservation land purchases to pay for maintenance projects on federal property.

“Fortunately,” the order does not include one of the administration’s worst ideas, leaving out its prior proposal to divert LWCF funding for unauthorized purposes,” said Amy Lindholm, a spokesperson for the Land and Water Conservation Fund Coalition.

Lindholm continued, “Unfortunately, Secretarial Order 3442 still does real damage. It hinders critical conservation and public access by reviving previously rejected ideas.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-90/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/avi-kwa-ame-national-monument-1024x6581757114975.jpeg?h=e69e7156&itok=IwnxmtEi,N,,2025-09-06 15:04:06.577579

Federal agents walked into a massive Hyundai and LG Energy Solutions construction site yesterday and detained nearly 500 people on suspected immigration offenses. The site, near Savannah, Georgia, is the home of a future electric vehicle battery plant. On Instagram, video posted by an account with the name Alex Morales showed a group of people listening to a masked man who identifies himself as part of Homeland Security.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED DHS OFFICER: We need construction to cease immediately. We need all work to end on the site right now.

DETROW: Homeland Security Investigations says this was the largest single-site operation they have ever carried out. NPR's Camila Domonoske covers cars for NPR and joins us now. Hey there.

CAMILA DOMONOSKE, BYLINE: Hi.

DETROW: What do we know about this workplace raid so far?

DOMONOSKE: Yeah. So Homeland Security Investigations, which is the branch of ICE that carries out this kind of workplace raid, they say that they detained 475 people, most of them South Korean. Hyundai and LG Energy Solutions - both of those companies are headquartered in South Korea. Here's Special Agent Steven Schrank speaking at a press conference.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

STEVEN SCHRANK: Some that illegally crossed the border into the United States, some that came in through visa waiver and were prohibited from working, some that had visas and overstayed their visas.

DETROW: So who was employing the people who were detained?

DOMONOSKE: It's a good question. You know, in a project like this, there are really complicated webs of subcontractors and subcontractors to subcontractors. Hyundai says that it believes that nobody detained was directly employed by Hyundai Motor Company. LG Energy Solutions hasn't responded to NPR's requests for comment.

That Homeland Security official said that this raid was tied to, quote, ""allegations of unlawful employment practices and serious federal crimes,"" end quote. He did not provide more details on that, and there are no charges filed in this case right now. Officials say this is an ongoing investigation. It would be unusual if charges are eventually filed because immigration raids like this, where workers are detained - they don't often end with criminal charges for employers.

DETROW: Tell us more about where this raid happened.

DOMONOSKE: It's on this huge campus of buildings near Savannah, Georgia, that also includes a large factory where Hyundai is right now building electric vehicles. That factory was not directly affected by the raid. Production of vehicles didn't actually stop. But the battery plant that's under construction nearby, which is where the raid actually happened - it's an important part of the long-term plans for this facility 'cause the goal is to build not just electric vehicles, but the whole supply chain for these vehicles here in the U.S.

And that's important not just to Hyundai, but actually to the United States more broadly in this effort to try to compete with China over the future of electric vehicles. So Hyundai is investing some $26 billion in moving manufacturing to the U.S., including this project. It's a big deal for the company and for Georgia. The state's called it the largest economic development project in state history.

DETROW: And I understand you just heard back from Hyundai. What did they say?

DOMONOSKE: They said they're going to conduct an investigation into suppliers and their subcontractors to make sure they are all following employment law and other laws and regulations. Meanwhile, Congressman Buddy Carter, who represents the area surrounding the plant, posted on X that he applauded the Trump administration for taking bold action. And the South Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs says it voiced concerns to the United States about respecting South Korean economic activity and citizens.

The cluster, therefore, has cultivated a network of members and partners that it regularly convenes to offer opportunities to build relationships, exchange ideas, and foster innovation. Some of the most notable members include ABB, Duke Energy, and Hitachi, all of which have seats on the Research Triangle Cleantech Cluster Board of Directors. The cleantech cluster also deploys programs and taps partnerships to help develop the next generation of cleantech leaders, such as the Cleantech Connect Career Fair, which it claims is the biggest cleantech career fair in the Southeast.

After graduation, the startups can apply for a Joules Camp pilot grant to deploy their technologies in local communities. With two 90-day cohorts per year, the accelerator has seen more than 90 graduates join its portfolio, which have raised more than $1.7 billion in early-stage venture funding and created more than 3,300 new jobs to date. Some of their most notable graduates include Huntersville, North Carolina-based EV charging solution provider Atom Power and San Francisco, California-based EV charging optimization company WeaveGrid. The nonprofit also received support from companies including GE Vernova, Honeywell, and both the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Economic Development Association.

Georgia

In 2023, the Greenhouse Accelerator launched the Georgia Cleantech Innovation Hub in Atlanta. The state is located in the battery belt, with universities that spend more than $3 billion on research and development per year. Furthermore, there are more than 800 cleantech companies in Atlanta alone, particularly in the e-mobility and solar industries. The public-private-academic partnership seeks to contribute to this momentum by providing local education to build cleantech expertise, building a connected community of cleantech leaders, creating places for them to meet, and ultimately, “fostering the innovation and sustainability culture in a way that is uniquely Georgia.”

The Georgia Cleantech Innovation Hub last year teamed up with gener8tor and the Cox Enterprises empire to launch the Cox Cleantech Accelerator in Atlanta. The twice-yearly, twelve-week program, with five companies per cohort, has supplied Southeastern early-stage operations with industry connections, mentorship, and $100,000 in capital investment each. Some of the success stories from the first program include Accelerate Wind, whose small wind turbines are meant to be paired with solar panels for commercial rooftop installation to boost energy generation by an additional 25%, and Flux Hybrids, whose plug-in hybrid powertrain technology can be installed on new vehicles to increase their fuel efficiency. The second cohort launched at the end of last month. Moreover, Cox Enterprises and Cox Cleantech have collectively invested more than $2 billion in cleantech businesses spanning a variety of stages, from early startups to more commercially successful companies, since 2007.

Tennessee

In 2020, the Spark Innovation Center at the University of Tennessee Research Park teamed up with Evergreen Climate Innovations – previously Clean Energy Trust – to launch the Spark Cleantech Accelerator. In the five years following, the twelve-week accelerator program has assisted 29 early-stage cleantech companies that have together raised more than $77 million in funding and created 108 jobs. Last year, the Spark Innovation Center announced that the country’s biggest utility, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), would sponsor the Spark Cleantech Accelerator, offering its technical expertise, as well as funding to the startups. The companies selected for the 2025 Spark Cleantech Accelerator, which will launch at the end of this month, can expect to benefit from training workshops, prototyping services through the University of Tennessee’s Center for Materials Processing, and practice with pitching. Other sources of funding and support for the program include the City of Knoxville and the Tennessee Advanced Energy Business Council.

Alabama

The Birmingham-based Techstars Alabama Power EnergyTech Accelerator is part of the Techstars network, launched with support from the utility Alabama Power in 2020. The accelerator invests across the entire energy vertical, ranging from clean energy, to clean vehicles, to the grid. By the end of 2023, the participating companies in the program had collectively raised $150 million. Graduates have included Boise, Idaho-based Pitch Aeronautics, which deploys power line components via droids, and Los Angeles, California-based EV Safe Charge, whose EV charging robot, named ZiGGY, comes to you. Other support for this accelerator came from the University of Alabama, the Economic Development Partnership of Alabama, and the Alabama Department of Commerce, again indicating the importance of community involvement in these types of initiatives. As Managing Director Matthew Jaeh explained, “Success is not achievable without support. There are ladder climbers and ladder builders. Be a ladder builder.”",https://thebusinessdownload.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/473079573_588613823883871_6276911064469355288_n-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 11:01:31.208615

Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty in Oak Ridge on Thursday to celebrate what is becoming a pattern in the Atomic City of major nuclear companies announcing giant investments.

Oklo, a California-based developer of advanced nuclear reactors and fuel recycling, unveiled plans to build a nuclear fuel recycling plant in the first stage of an advanced fuel center that could total $1.68 billion invested and 800 jobs created.

The fuel recycling center would be the first of its kind in the U.S. and would turn used nuclear fuel into fuel for so-called fast reactors like Oklo's Aurora powerhouse, which is cooled by liquid metal rather than water.

The company said it was working with the Tennessee Valley Authority, the largest public utility in the U.S., to explore recycling used fuel from its nuclear plants at the Oak Ridge facility. It could also one day sell electricity from its reactors to TVA, which is based in Knoxville and has its largest presence in Chattanooga.

""Fuel is the most important factor in bringing advanced nuclear energy to market,"" Jacob DeWitte, Oklo co-founder and CEO, said in a press release. ""By recycling used fuel at scale, we are turning waste into gigawatts, reducing costs and establishing a secure U.S. supply chain that will support the deployment of clean, reliable and affordable power. Tennessee is showing the nation that recycling can be done to support new nuclear development and growth.""

Oklo has completed a licensing plan for the facility with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. More than 94,000 tons of spent nuclear fuel is stored at nuclear power plant sites, much of which is recyclable, the company said.

The Oak Ridge facility is expected to begin producing fuel for Oklo reactors by the early 2030s.

The U.S. Department of Energy gave Oklo a site use permit in 2019, and the company was awarded fuel for its first reactor from Idaho National Laboratory. The company says it's on track to bring its first reactor online by the end of the decade.

Oklo cited executive orders from President Donald Trump aimed at streamlining nuclear licensing and speeding up new nuclear deployments, partly in a race to compete with China on artificial intelligence development.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman stepped down as chair of the Oklo board earlier this year to avoid conflicts of interest as the two companies deepen their partnerships.

TVA is a critical piece of the AI puzzle as the power provider to Oak Ridge since the town was created by the U.S. government in 1943 to enrich uranium for the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, in 1945.

""The next generation of nuclear technologies are being built and developed right here in our own backyard,"" TVA President and CEO Don Moul said in the release. ""Our partnership with Oklo represents yet another step forward in shaping the future of nuclear energy and ensuring a secure energy future for the Valley and beyond.""

The Oklo announcement came one year to the day after Orano USA, the U.S. subsidiary of French nuclear fuels company Orano, announced it would build in Oak Ridge what state officials called the largest private investment in Tennessee history.

Orano plans to construct a multibillion-dollar uranium enrichment plant on land formerly owned by the U.S. Department of Energy to sell domestically produced nuclear fuel to commercial power plants.

The nuclear fuel supply chain was upended in 2022 when Russia, the world's dominant supplier of enriched uranium, launched a full-scale war against Ukraine.

Gov. Bill Lee has worked to position Tennessee as the U.S. leader in attracting nuclear investment and supporting nuclear companies, creating a special fund and an advisory council in 2023. Orano received $6 million from the state fund.

More than 150 nuclear companies have a presence in Oak Ridge, according to the East Tennessee Economic Council.

""Tennessee is well positioned to lead America's energy independence, which is why we created the Nuclear Energy Fund to support and expand our state's nuclear ecosystem,"" Lee said in the release. ""We're proud to partner with Oklo to innovate for the future, while bringing continued opportunity and prosperity to Tennessee families.""",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/imports/adg/img/2025/09/06/103773279_fuel_recycling_render_pr_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4,N,,2025-09-06 03:58:09.560374

He noted that two million people used the home improvement tax credit in its first year alone.
But, Ungar added, the tax credits can still save people thousands of dollars before they vanish.
All items must be “placed in service” by then to qualify, though a reminder: Tax credits lower your tax liability but don’t come back as rebates.
“With or without the tax credit, these improvements bring energy savings that lower energy bills,” he said.","The “one big beautiful bill” that President Donald Trump signed into law in July is set to upend many aspects of American life, including climate policy. The law, which Republicans backed en masse, not only derails the nation’s efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it could also strike a blow to consumers’ pocketbooks.

From a climate perspective, the legislation’s most significant rollbacks are aimed at industries such as renewable energy, not individuals. But there will be very real impacts for taxpayers hoping to decarbonize their homes.

The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, provided tax credits for climate-friendly purchases ranging from heat pumps to solar arrays through 2032. That time frame has been cut to as little as a few months.

“This bill is going to take away a lot of assistance from consumers,” said Lowell Ungar, director of federal policy for the nonprofit American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. He noted that two million people used the home improvement tax credit in its first year alone.

The good news is that the law does not affect the billions of dollars that the IRA already sent to state efficiency and electrification rebate programs, and that much of that money will remain available beyond the federal sunsets. But, Ungar added, the tax credits can still save people thousands of dollars before they vanish.

“If consumers are able to make the investment now,” he said, “it will help them out.”

For those looking to act, Grist shares a roundup of when credits will go away.

Buy an EV before October

New electric vehicles that meet federal domestic manufacturing requirements qualify for a tax credit of up to $7,500. While credits on foreign-made EVs aren’t offered directly to consumers, automakers do get them and often pass the savings along through leases. Used EVs under $25,000 that are purchased at a dealer are also eligible for up to a $4,000 credit.

All of this goes away on September 30. There will be no credits after that. Ultimately, this will make new electric vehicles more expensive and put the technology further out of reach for low- to moderate-income Americans.

The income caps on the EV credits still apply, limiting the benefit on new EVs to those households earning less than $300,000 and on used vehicles to those earning less than $150,000. There is an MSRP limit of $80,000 for new cars, too.

Strangely, the tax credit for installing an EV charger (up to $1,000) runs through June of next year.

Make home improvements by the end of the year

The remarkably vast Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit provides up to $2,000 toward qualified heat pumps, water heaters, biomass stoves, or biomass boilers. It offers another $1,200 toward efficiency upgrades such as insulation, doors, windows, and even home energy audits.

These are going away on December 31. All items must be “placed in service” by then to qualify, though a reminder: Tax credits lower your tax liability but don’t come back as rebates. You must have a tax bill to benefit, which may not be the case for certain low-income households.

Pay for solar this year

The most valuable IRA incentive being axed is the Residential Clean Energy Credit. It covers 30 percent of clean energy systems such as solar panels, wind turbines, and geothermal heat pumps, and there is no cap. With the average cost of a solar system in the U.S. just north of $28,000, that means a tax credit would be worth around $8,500. That credit vanishes at the end of this year, though the law refers to the “expenditures” being made by then, so that could mean paying for — but not necessarily installing — a system by then.

Like with other credits, Ungar suggests confirming any changes with a tax professional. He also said that the potential for higher tariffs is another reason to move quickly. But, he said, even after the credits go away, many of these improvements could still make financial sense over the long term.

“With or without the tax credit, these improvements bring energy savings that lower energy bills,” he said. “In some cases, improvements are going to be a no-brainer regardless.”",https://keyt.b-cdn.net/2025/09/grist-environmental-tax-credits_0.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 12:08:00.281778

DTE Energy (DTE), a major player in the U.S. energy market, now faces a high-stakes legal battle involving its subsidiary, EES Coke Battery, LLC, which could redefine how investors assess regulatory exposure in utility valuations.

Legal Developments and Escalating Risks

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has filed a motion for partial summary judgment against EES Coke, alleging Clean Air Act violations at the Zug Island facility. A federal court denied DTE’s motion to dismiss the case, ruling that DTE is an operator of the facility and thus legally liable under the Act [1]. On August 25, 2025, the court granted the EPA’s motion for partial summary judgment on liability, effectively confirming the company’s responsibility for sulfur dioxide emissions and reporting failures [2]. EES Coke has since sought an interlocutory appeal to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, but a bench trial to determine remedies—including a potential $140 million fine—remains scheduled for September 15, 2025 [3].

This case underscores the growing scrutiny of legacy industrial operations within utility portfolios. According to a report by USA Herald, the EPA’s demand for penalties reflects a broader regulatory shift toward stricter enforcement of air quality standards, particularly for facilities emitting sulfur dioxide, a pollutant linked to respiratory illnesses and environmental degradation [3].

Financial Exposure and Valuation Implications

DTE Energy has acknowledged the case as a “material event” in its SEC filings, though it cannot predict the financial impact [2]. The potential $140 million fine alone could strain the non-utility segment of DTE’s business, which includes EES Coke. For context, DTE’s non-utility segment reported operating income of $250 million in Q2 2025 [1]. If the court imposes additional remediation costs or operational restrictions, the financial burden could escalate further.

Regulatory risks like these are not merely one-time charges; they can erode investor confidence and inflate capital costs. Utilities are typically valued using metrics like earnings yield and dividend stability, but regulatory penalties introduce volatility. As stated by Planet Detroit, the case adds to DTE’s existing challenges in its clean energy transition, where compliance costs and capital expenditures for decarbonization are already rising [1].

Investor Considerations: Balancing Risk and Resilience

For investors, the EES Coke case highlights the importance of evaluating regulatory risk as a core component of utility valuation. While DTE’s utility operations remain stable—benefiting from regulated rate structures and long-term infrastructure projects—the non-utility segment’s exposure to litigation could create asymmetrical risks.

Data from Panabee indicates that DTE’s stock has historically traded at a premium to peers due to its diversified energy portfolio and transition plans [1]. However, the current legal uncertainty may pressure its valuation multiples, particularly if the EPA’s demands are upheld. A $140 million fine would represent approximately 1.5% of DTE’s 2025 market capitalization, but the reputational and operational costs could be far greater.

Conclusion: Navigating the New Normal

The EES Coke case is a microcosm of the broader tension between industrial legacy and regulatory modernization. For DTE, the outcome of the September trial will not only determine its immediate financial exposure but also signal how courts and regulators will hold utilities accountable for environmental stewardship.

Investors must weigh these risks against DTE’s long-term strategy. While the company’s clean energy investments and regulated utility operations provide a buffer, the EES Coke litigation serves as a reminder that regulatory compliance is no longer a passive obligation—it is a dynamic, capital-intensive challenge that can redefine utility valuations. As the trial approaches, all eyes will be on Zug Island to see whether DTE can navigate this storm without sacrificing its position as a leader in the energy transition.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-06 02:00:27.552810

From St. James to Cameron Parish, environmental justice organizations have dragged parish commissions, global corporations and state agencies into court.

One group, The Descendants Project, a nonprofit based in St. John the Baptist Parish, has filed at least three lawsuits in recent years over a Formosa Plastics zoning dispute. One targeted the parish government itself, while the other targeted Formosa. A third lawsuit related to the same dispute was filed against the Port of South Louisiana.

The disputed zoning change, passed unanimously in 1990, reclassified land in Wallace from residential to heavy industrial. The Descendants Project says the move was tainted by corruption tied to then-Parish President Lester Millet and aimed at benefiting Formosa Plastics.

The land is home to the graves of former enslaved Blacks. Their names were Simon, Betsy, Rachel, Stanley and Harry.

In July, The Descendants Project and Inclusive Louisiana filed suit against Formosa, saying that Formosa is violating the 13th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution by owning and controlling the bodies.

While such lawsuits are sometimes well intentioned, they are ""at least in part by a desire simply to burden the defendant or the defendant’s industry in some way,"" said Robert Stilson of the Capital Research Center. ""This might be through causing delays or increased costs, scoring public relations points, or attempting to achieve through litigation what those activists have been unable to achieve through legislation""

The Descendants Project also sued the Port of South Louisiana, accusing its board of secretly predetermining a vote on Greenfield’s grain elevator deal through email – a violation, they allege, of the state’s open meetings law.

Many of the lawsuits across the state include the same groups.

RISE St. James, Inclusive Louisiana, and the Mount Triumph Baptist Church, represented by the Tulane University Environmental Law Clinic, are pressing their case against St. James Parish and Koch. Koch and parish officials have asked the Louisiana Supreme Court to shut the case down and revive approvals for an expansion at Koch’s methanol plant.

The same three groups, also represented by Tulane, have a separate lawsuit against the parish saying it “discriminates against them by directing hazardous industrial facility development towards majority-Black districts and Black churches, where their members and congregants live.”

And just last week, another front opened in Cameron Parish, as reported by The Advocate. The Louisiana Bucket Brigade, Sierra Club, and Environmental Integrity Project filed suit against the state Department of Environmental Quality for granting Venture Global a permit to build its Calcasieu Pass 2 liquefied natural gas facility.

“This company has been a bad neighbor and continually pollutes the air we breathe, while generating billions of dollars in profits,” resident and Sierra Club member John Allaire said in announcing the lawsuit.

The Sierra Club chapter of Louisiana, an environmental lobbying and legal group, has a long list of ongoing litigation against various big businesses.

""It’s disappointing to see nationally-backed activists try to litigate their agenda instead of working with local communities to understand the positive impact U.S. LNG brings to Louisiana and the world,” Venture Global wrote The Center Square in a statement.

The Bucket Brigade has also turned its firepower on New Orleans, suing the city and a development district in 2024 over a tax break deal for Shell Oil. The group says it was rushed through illegally and unfairly shifted tax burdens onto residents.

Taken together, the lawsuits reflect the strategy of a small but interconnected network of nonprofit groups that have reshaped environmental battles in south Louisiana.

The Descendants Project and Inclusive Louisiana have focused on challenging heavy industry expansion in St. John and St. James parishes, where descendants of enslaved people live in neighborhoods overshadowed by industrial development.

The Bucket Brigade has become one of the most visible opponents of industry in “Cancer Alley,” winning national recognition for forcing the cancellation of projects like the billion-dollar Wanhua chemical plant.

The Bucket Brigade, founded more than 20 years ago, has broadened its reach from oil refineries to liquefied natural gas export terminals, running campaigns that identify and train local residents to speak before federal regulators, track accidents, and rally community resistance.

In its filings, the group says it is building an “early warning network” across parishes most targeted for industrial growth, particularly majority-Black communities in St. James and St. John.

Some of these nonprofits are being bankrolled by an out-of-state foundation with an ironic stake in Big Oil. The Elizabeth B. and Arthur E. Roswell Foundation Inc., which as of 2023 held more than 6,800 shares of BP stock, has poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into Louisiana’s grassroots groups.

Tax records show the Roswell Foundation gave $33,000 to the Descendants Project, $76,000 to the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, and tens of thousands more to groups like Jubilee Justice in Alexandria, Rural Roots Louisiana, and Voice of the Experienced.

The foundation committed even larger future payments, including $90,000 to the Descendants Project, $120,000 to the Bucket Brigade, and $120,000 to Rural Roots Louisiana.

Cancer rates in Louisiana are among the highest in the nation and are often attributed to irresponsible business practices in the petrochemical industry, which has a massive presence in Louisiana.

This is after the Biden administration implemented policies to halt oil and natural gas permits nationwide and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit last August vacated authorizations for LNG projects in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas.

In response, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, led a bicameral and bipartisan group last year expressing support for LNG development in the RGV. Cruz, Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Cameron County Judge Eddie Treviño, Jr., also argued the court’s “unprecedented” revocation of already issued permits created “a new reality that threatens thousands of jobs, undermines economic growth in Texas, and, according to a former Obama Administration official, even puts future investment in renewable energy infrastructure at risk.”

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in 2023 had approved the construction and operation of Rio Grande LNG’s proposed LNG terminal project, Rio Grande LNG Terminal, and Rio Bravo Pipeline Company’s proposed pipeline project, Rio Bravo Pipeline Project, but three judges on the court vacated the approvals.

The Rio Grande LNG Project will develop, own, operate and maintain a natural gas pipeline system to access natural gas from the Agua Dulce Hub and an LNG export facility in south Texas. It’s slated to export 27 million tons of LNG a year to the global market. The Rio Grande LNG Terminal Project will provide LNG for truck transport and fueling operations.

The projects will create thousands of jobs and bring more than $18 billion in investment to South Texas, officials in support of the projects argue.

Fast forward to 2025, two months after President Donald Trump was sworn into office, the court reinstated FERC’s 2023 approvals.

In response, Cruz said the court “was right to reexamine its previous decision and restore these permits, which had already been issued and should never have been vacated.” The court’s decision last year “jeopardized 7,000 high-paying jobs and $24 billion in investment in the Rio Grande Valley, set a dangerous precedent for energy infrastructure development and investment nationwide, and needed to be revisited.”

Fast forward to this July, and FERC issued an environmental impact statement concluding “the projects would result in less than significant impacts.”

On August 29, FERC issued a final rule authorizing Rio Grande LNG Terminal construction to move forward. The rule states that the project “is not inconsistent with the public interest under section 3 of the Natural Gas Act (NGA), and the Rio Bravo Pipeline Project is required by the public convenience and necessity under section 7 of the NGA.”

Cruz praised the FERC approval saying the new projects would strengthen “Texas’s energy leadership. Texas is the energy capital of the world, and I am proud to fight to ensure it stays that way.”

In order to prevent a court from revoking permits after they were already issued, Cruz, Cornyn and U.S. Rep. Wesley Hunt, all Republicans from Houston, introduced the Protect LNG Act earlier this year.

The bill would prevent courts from halting LNG permits when a lawsuit is filed and require that the cases only be filed in the circuit court jurisdiction where the LNG facility is located, not the location of a federal agency that issues the requested permits. It also includes timelines for lawsuits among other stipulations, The Center Square reported.

Texas lawmakers led the charge to support LNG development in south Texas as Texas continues to lead the U.S. in oil and natural gas production and emissions reductions.

The U.S. leads the world in LNG exports, led by the Gulf states of Texas and Louisiana. In 2017, the U.S. became a net exporter of natural gas for the first time since 1957, “primarily because of increased LNG exports,” according to the U.S. Energy Information Agency.

Three summers later, another budget bill is reshaping clean energy in the U.S.

The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (OBBBA) rolls back many of the clean energy provisions in the IRA, striking heavy blows to government support of solar, wind, electric vehicles (EVs), and energy efficiency. The good news, limited though it may be, is that the bill leaves the central provision for energy storage intact, with the investment tax credit (ITC) still available until the 2030s.

This article is part of POWER’s annual special edition published in partnership with the RE+ trade show. This year’s event is scheduled for Sept. 8-11, 2025, in Las Vegas, Nevada. Click here to read the entire special issue, and if you’re attending RE+, be sure to connect with the POWER team at our booth on Venetian Level 1—V3046.

Batteries did not, however, escape the IRA dismantling unscathed. Operators eyeing new battery projects now must adhere to the challenging Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) requirements to qualify for the ITC. The OBBBA especially squeezes operators whose projects are to be co-located with solar, as they’ll now need to either begin construction by July 4, 2026, or have their site in service by 2027 to qualify for the solar ITC.

The new provisions ultimately mean that, even with the ITC for battery storage still in place, it is more paramount than ever that operators extract the most revenue possible from their batteries. Analytics is one way to do that.

Lowering Upfront Cost

Battery storage already requires a significant upfront investment well before any post-energization revenue generation begins, and that investment level could rise as operators seek domestic suppliers to meet the ITC’s new FEOC requirements. Analytics software can help reduce the cost of storage projects even before installation through processes known as modeling and digital commissioning.

Using modeling through analytics, operators can determine exactly what size system they need for their site with advanced predictive software. This avoids a scenario where an operator may order more storage than necessary for their planned use case, and enables them to optimize their battery choices for a deployment focused on revenue-generating market services. With the stricter requirements for the ITC, it is more essential than ever to avoid the unnecessary expense of an oversized system.

Digital commissioning enabled by analytics (Figure 1) offers more cost control in the OBBBA era. With the deeper access to system- and cell-level data, analytics software can identify issues that may go unnoticed by conventional on-site commissioning. Digital commissioning could, for example, detect a malfunctioning cell early, helping to prevent more significant and costly downtime further down the line.

Unlocking Greater Revenue

With the OBBBA increasing costs for operators, especially those planning a solar + storage system, energy market participation offers one of the most promising ways to increase revenue from battery storage. Though options differ across America’s independent system operators (ISOs) and regional transmission organizations (RTOs), battery energy storage system (BESS) operators can enroll their installations in services such as arbitrage, frequency regulation, demand reduction, peak shaving, and reserve capacity.

Navigating these various programs can be daunting. While many energy management systems (EMS) support dispatch and basic market participation, they often lack the depth needed to optimize performance across diverse ISO/RTO markets. BESS analytics can complement EMS by helping operators coordinate how each storage asset participates in trading while taking into account technical constraints like degradation, state of charge (SoC), and thermal behavior. As market rules and rate structures shift, BESS analytics can automate the evaluation of participation opportunities and recommend adjustments that protect both profit and asset health.

Easing the path to energy markets is just one way that analytics help operators increase the return on investment (ROI) of their storage systems. During regular operations, analytics continuously monitor battery performance for anomalies that operators can address before they escalate into a critical issue. Analytics will catch an issue early that an EMS would find only when it requires taking the entire battery out of operation—and out of revenue-generation.

Analytics also helps operators determine which operating strategies are best for long-term revenue. Storage operations often emphasize short-term revenue, which has the tradeoff of accelerating battery degradation, leading to lower revenue over the battery’s lifetime. Analytics provides the tools for operators to maximize the life of their batteries, ultimately resulting in greater total revenue over time. A short-term revenue strategy also often leads to operators exceeding their battery’s warranty without realizing it—a situation analytics will alert operators to well in advance.

Compared to an EMS, analytics better gauges the true SoC of a battery, a critical element for revenue generation, as it reflects the battery’s usable capacity. EMS platforms typically rely on aggregate battery management system, or BMS, data, which can become less reliable under real-world conditions such as degradation or high cycling. In contrast, analytics use advanced modeling to estimate SoC based on cell-level behavior. True SoC is critical for delivering promised energy in market trading and ancillary services; without it, operators risk underperformance penalties and a significant hit to revenue.

Storage Revenue is More Critical Than Ever

The OBBBA dealt a brutal blow to the clean energy aspirations set in motion by the IRA, but it need not serve as a death knell for a maturing industry. Solar, wind, storage, and more will all be essential to preserving the stability of the electric grid. Storage, which retains its expanded ITC, offers a rare policy foothold amid broader rollbacks. Even so, rising costs and growing uncertainties are likely to challenge storage operators. Now more than ever, tools like battery analytics will play an increasingly important role in helping renewable energy projects reach their full potential.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/figure-1-twaice-usable-and-recoverable-energy.png,N,,2025-09-06 12:07:44.108975

For decades, the residents of the Ohio Valley have been paying for the aftermath of extractive industries. That “beautiful clean coal” Presidnet Donald Trump refers to took lives, and left a legacy of mine shafts and acid mine run-off. Taxpayers continue to foot the bills to plug orphan oil and gas wells and clean-up un-reclaimed strip mined lands.

Recently, the Ohio River Valley was targeted to become a carbon capture and sequestration hub. This hub will consist of a series of pipelines and Class VI injection wells that will theoretically allow industrial facilities to store carbon dioxide permanently underground. However, this technology has proven to be unsuccessful, expensive and dangerous. As usual, this hub comes with promises of jobs and economic development. Tenaska, the company which has received $55 million from the U.S. Department of Energy to help build this hub, held an open-house in Cadiz in July. However, there was no formal presentation and attendees left with more questions than answers.

Proponents of carbon capture are reluctant to share details about this technology and instead claim the industry will bring “millions of jobs and billions of investment dollars.” (see “Carbon capture can be an economic accelerator,” Aug. 23.). A report by the Ohio River Valley Institute believes the number of jobs are being greatly exaggerated. The hub is expected to “permanently employ a total of four people, according to an economic impact study commissioned and sponsored by Tenaska and prepared by West Virginia University’s Bureau of Business and Economic Research.”

Unlike enhanced oil recovery, an injection process that has been used for 40 years to recover residual oil in the western oil fields, carbon capture and sequestration is a relatively new process. Carbon dioxide will be captured from industrial sources, condensed to create a super critical fluid and delivered by pipelines to Class VI injection wells. Federal legislation for CCS Class VI wells was established in 2010 and since then, fewer than 30 wells nationally have received permits, and only two wells are operational. There are 12 Class VI well applications for Ohio, but no wells are in operation in the state. Additionally, no industries or power plants in Ohio have been retrofitted to capture carbon dioxide from their emissions, and no super critical state CO2 pipelines have been laid.

Numerous peer-reviewed studies show there are safety hazards and environmental concerns to consider from the capture site (power plants, ethanol plants, ammonia plants and steel mills) to the Class VI injection wells. The toxic chemicals needed to sequester the CO2 gas include lye and ammonia, and these must be produced, transported, handled and eventually disposed of in order to operate CCS at scale. These compounds threaten frontline communities. Some estimates say at least 900 miles of pipelines would be required to carry CO2 across the state from sources to the injection wells in Eastern Ohio.

Revisions to federal safety rules for CO2, written by the Pipeline Hazardous Materials Safety Administration are still in limbo. In Satartia, Miss., 45 people were injured from a pipeline rupture. Studies have shown that leaks in the Class VI wells will release the carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere, nullifying any potential gains in reducing carbon emissions.

Leaks can also threaten groundwater, as was the case in recent accidents at Archer Daniel Midland in Illinois. Environmental groups and lawmakers were concerned that the Mahomet Aquifer, the sole source aquifer for the region and drinking water source for more than 1 million people, might become acidic and undrinkable. “Once CO2 dissolves in water, it forms carbonic acid, which lowers the pH of the water, eroding and corroding rock and well equipment, and mobilizing toxic metals such as lead, arsenic and mercury.”

Ohio has more than 36,000 orphan oil wells, which adds to the risks of injecting high pressure CO2 into Ohio’s Appalachian counties. A recent explosion during an orphan well capping operation in the Wayne National Forest speaks to the inherit dangers of these old wells. Ben Ebenhack, professor emeritus of petroleum engineering at Marietta College, said in a recent piece in the Marietta Times, “We don’t know where all these orphan wells are (some were plugged with wood)” and believes they pose “safety hazards for new drilling operations.”

The Marietta area also is dealing with brine wastewater from Class II wells infiltrating vertical oil and gas wells, as well as water wells in the Washington County area. How safe will our communities be if we start injecting 1,000 psi super critical carbon dioxide, a known asphyxiant, under more than 80,000 acres of our region where mines, vertical oil wells, brine injection wells and fracking wells exist?

Seismicity within the proposed carbon dioxide storage space could be problematic. According to the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Noble County in Southeastern Ohio recorded more than 70 earthquakes this year, second only to Washington County which recorded 76. “The presence of seismic activity, natural and induced, is of great importance when evaluating CO2 sequestration potential. Extensive fault zones may provide leakage pathways along which CO2 could migrate,” according to a study published in Environmental Geosciences.

CCS retrofits on power plants need significant amounts of water for cooling the additional equipment required to capture the CO2. They also will require up to 30 percent more energy. Taxpayers will be picking up the tab for costly retrofits to gas and coal power plants in the form of increased electricity bills. Taxpayers also will pay for the 45Q tax credits for carbon dioxide captured. The Inflation Reduction Act established rates per ton of CO2 sequestered at $85 per ton and the One Big Beautiful Bill kept these credits; even increasing some credits for CO2 used for enhanced oil recovery.

The Trump administration is trying to roll back environmental regulations that address climate change at the same time they are pushing for tax credits to capture the same emissions causing climate change. According to the Geoengineering Monitor, after decades of research, “there is no evidence that CCS can address the causes of the climate crisis or significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions” but it can put our communities at risk, leave us with the externalities and cost taxpayers billions of dollars.

Tesla reincorporated in Texas after a Delaware judge rejected Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package. Texas corporate law offers greater protection from legal challenges, allowing Tesla to propose a larger pay deal for Musk.

Delaware -Elon Musk's blow-out $1 trillion pay package from Tesla proves everything is bigger in Texas, especially under its new management-friendly law.

Last year, Tesla reincorporated in the Lone Star State after a judge in its former corporate home, Delaware, ruled a $56 billion compensation for the CEO was ""unfathomable"" and unfair to shareholders. Musk urged companies to ditch Delaware and his board worked on a new pay package.

Freed from the constraints of Delaware's widely used corporate law, Tesla has super-sized the next pay deal for Musk, already the world's richest person. Despite increasing his pay nearly 20-fold, there is a better chance this package will be approved and a lesser risk it will be struck down in the courts, thanks to Texas's corporate law.

In addition, it would be harder for shareholders to challenge the independence of the two board members who developed the pay package.

Unlike the 2018 pay package, this time around Musk will be allowed to use his voting power, which is around 13.5%, according to Friday's security filing. If recent history is a guide, that will lock in approval.

Live Events

Last year, the company's shareholders voted to ""ratify"" Musk's 2018 pay package in an attempt to essentially undo the court ruling and restore Musk's pay package. Musk will be able to vote about 411 million shares at this year's shareholder meeting, nearly outweighing the 529 million shares that voted against ratification.

In the end, the ratification vote did not matter because the Delaware judge ruled it did not override her prior decision. That ruling and her ruling striking Musk's $56 billion compensation are on appeal.

In 2018, the company barred Musk from voting his shares to make it harder for investors to sue under Delaware law.

Now Tesla does not need to do that because it has much better protection from legal challenges - the law in Texas, where it reincorporated last year.

""They are completely insulated from a shareholder lawsuit in Texas,"" said Ann Lipton, a professor at the University of Colorado Law School.

Tesla told investors last year in its pitch to approve its move from Delaware to Texas that laws in the two states were ""substantially equivalent"" and there was no reason to believe shareholders would have weaker litigation rights in Texas.

Things, however, changed in May when Texas lawmakers allowed companies to require shareholders to own 3% of a stock before they can sue.

Tesla quickly adopted a 3% bylaw. Musk is the only individual shareholder who meets that requirement. Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street do as well, but they are passive investors. Other investors could band together to reach the threshold.

By contrast, Delaware does not limit who can sue and many lawsuits are brought by investors with tiny stakes and the cases are overseen and funded by a handful of specialized law firms, which is a source of frustration to corporate boards. Richard Tornetta owned nine shares of Tesla when he sued over the 2018 pay package.

""We believe this bait-and-switch effectively was an effort to pull the wool over shareholders' eyes,"" the New York State Comptroller said in a proposal in Friday's proxy statement.

The comptroller is asking Tesla shareholders to repeal the 3% threshold at the annual meeting where shareholders will also vote on Musk's pay package.

Lipton said if shareholders do not like the pay package proposal, they still have an option. ""Sell,"" she said.

Aspen Power Acquires Projects in Illinois and New Jersey, Closes on Tax Equity Financing

This week was a busy one for distributed generation platform Aspen Power, which announced the acquisition of four projects in two states and closed on a new tax equity facility.

The company snapped up two community solar gardens in Illinois with a combined capacity of 13.9 megawatts direct current (MWdc). Located in Grafton and Mattoon, the projects are expected to generate over 19 million kilowatt-hours (kWh)- the clean energy equivalent to powering 2,770 homes each year.

The projects were acquired from Greenwood Sustainable Infrastructure (GSI) and are part of a larger portfolio spanning Illinois and New York, which also includes sites nearing final completion. Aspen Power recently closed on another 14.1 MW Illinois portfolio and has announced a partnership to acquire 20 additional community solar projects totaling up to 19 MW, primarily in Illinois.

Aspen Power also acquired two community solar projects in New Jersey totaling just over 1 MWdc solar capacity from Ecogy Energy. The projects, located in Millville (South Jersey) and Ocean Township (Monmouth County), were initially developed by Ecogy Energy and are approaching the start of construction. The acquisition is part of a series of deals Aspen Power announced spanning four states. The projects are in Atlantic City Electric and Jersey Central Power & Light utility territories and will provide subscribers with a discount on prevailing utility rates.

“Solar is the cheapest form of power available to Americans of all income levels,” reminded Jorge Vargas, Chief Executive Officer of Aspen Power.

“Collaboration is essential to accelerating the clean energy transition, and our partnership with Ecogy Energy demonstrates how working together can deliver results where they matter most,” stated Dan Gulick, Executive Vice President of Community Solar at Aspen Power.

“These projects are a great representation of Ecogy’s continued focus on developing the mid-market commercial and industrial distributed energy resources space,” added Jack Bertuzzi, Principal at Ecogy Energy. “It’s great to have a partnership with Aspen Power, who see the value in these distributed generation projects and the outsized value they bring to the grid and the surrounding communities.”

Aspen Power’s new tax equity facility is with Monarch Private Capital and will support solar project portfolios across New York, Illinois, and Pennsylvania, further advancing the company’s 2025 pipeline. Aspen Power has now secured a total of $66 million in tax equity commitments during the first eight months of 2025, aiming to reach gigawatt scale by mid-decade.

ClearGen Forges $150M Multi-Year Partnership For Community and Commercial Solar Projects

ContourGlobal’s First U.S. Facility Comes Online

On Thursday, British power company ContourGlobal celebrated the energization of its first U.S. project, the initial phase of Black Hollow Sun I, a 185 MW installation near Severance, Colorado, serving Platte River Power Authority, the community-owned utility serving Fort Collins, Loveland, Estes Park, and Longmont. The facility, located in Weld County, is about 16 miles east of Fort Collins. It was originally developed by Hanwha Renewables and acquired by ContourGlobal earlier this year.

ContourGlobal is also constructing the second part of the project, BHS II, which will add 139 MW and is expected to be completed by the end of 2026. Together, the tandem will constitute the largest photovoltaic installation in Northern Colorado and Platte River’s largest contracted solar asset. Combined, the projects will produce nearly 608 GWh of clean electricity annually, enough to power more than 73,000 homes and avoid almost 450,000 metric tons of CO₂ emissions each year.

“The start of operations at Black Hollow Sun I is a pivotal moment for ContourGlobal, marking our first U.S. renewable plant to reach operational state, and especially meaningful as we celebrate our 20th anniversary since the company was incorporated in the U.S.,” commented Antonio Cammisecra, CEO of ContourGlobal.

ContourGlobal is using American-manufactured solar modules supplied by its partner Qcells, which is also providing its integrated EPC (Engineering, Procurement, Construction) solutions for this project. ContourGlobal’s overall U.S. portfolio now totals 2.8 GW of power generation capacity in operation, under construction, or in late-stage development. The company’s operational portfolio (1.5 GW) also includes a thermal fleet of 10 plants located in California, New Mexico, and Texas, as well as a light fuel oil plant in Connecticut.

Renewable Properties Announces New EV Fleet Charging Hub, Financing

Developer and investor Renewable Properties (RP) has closed on the purchase of land and a $20 million credit facility for a new electric vehicle (EV) charging hub for fleet vehicles in Richmond, California. The investment will also support RP’s development of nine other fleet charging depots in the San Francisco Bay Area, California’s Central Coast, and Chicago, Illinois.

The 4 MW Goodrick Avenue EV Depot project will commence construction in Q2 of 2026 and is expected to be completed by October 2027. It is being funded by a $20 million credit facility from a prominent family office investment firm. Renewable Properties has also received a $3 million grant from the Bay Area Air District to construct the fleet charging hub.

Located in an industrial infill area known for warehousing, distribution, and manufacturing, the Goodrick Avenue, Richmond location will become one of Renewable Properties’ first completed EV charging hubs for medium-duty EV truck fleets. Designed for commercial applications, such as delivery trucks, box trucks, utility service vehicles, and smaller buses, the facility will feature 60 charging stalls with 16 Level 3 DCFS chargers and 48 Level 2 chargers. The company expects additional committed capacity from PG&E in 2026, which will further expand the depot’s 4 MW of charging capacity.

“The Richmond charging hub is part of Renewable Properties’ expanded commitment to decarbonizing the transportation sector,” said Aaron Halimi, founder and President of Renewable Properties. “This launch will not only expand Bay Area EV fleet infrastructure, it will help lead a shift toward reducing diesel and gas emissions in high traffic corridors and support the health of disadvantaged communities.”

Renewable Properties also closed on $26.5 million in tax equity funding for its Fund 10 portfolio this week, expanding the company’s relationship with SOLCAP, KeyState’s tax equity investment platform.

Fund 10 includes three solar projects in California, totaling 17 MWdc. The projects have commenced construction and are scheduled for completion this year.

The 5.56 MWdc Redemeyer Road Solar Project in Ukiah, to be completed in Q4 2025, will incorporate a 4 MWdc/16 MWh energy storage system. Power from the Redemeyer project will be procured by community choice aggregator Sonoma Clean Power (SCP) as part of its EverGreen shared solar program, which allows customers to benefit from off-site solar, storage, and geothermal energy.

The Althea Avenue Solar Phase 1 and Phase 2 projects in Fresno County will complete construction by Q4 2025. Energy from the 6.42 MWdc Althea Solar Phase 1 project will contribute to the Disadvantaged Communities (DAC) Green Tariff program offered by Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E), which provides clean power to low to moderate-income-qualified residents with a 20% discount on their electric bills. The adjacent 5.02 MWdc Althea Phase 2 project is part of PG&E’s Solar Choice program, which allows customers to purchase solar energy to match either 50% or 100% of their energy use.

First Citizens Bank Provides $60 Million to Triple Oak Power

First Citizens Bank’s Energy Finance business has provided a $60 million credit facility to Triple Oak Power, a U.S.-based renewable energy developer backed by Energy Capital Partners, a leading investor in energy transition companies.

Triple Oak has an 8 GW pipeline of utility-scale onshore wind and hybrid projects currently under development. The new credit facility will be used to provide interconnection security postings for the development of renewable project assets.

The week began with a subcommittee markup of the Labor-HHS-Education bill, in which Republicans approved cuts to some climate and health programs but bucked the Trump administration by increasing funding for low-income electricity assistance.

On Wednesday, the Appropriations Committee marked up its Financial Services-General Government bill, approving conservative riders on climate and battery initiatives — including one targeting a major battery plant in a GOP-led district.

And on Thursday, dozens of Republicans joined Democrats to block conservative amendments to the Energy-Water bill that proposed to slash funding for popular climate and environment programs. The bill squeaked through on the floor, 214-213, with no Democratic support and several Republicans voting against it.

The discord among Republicans is not new; it cropped up last year and forced GOP leadership to cancel a vote on the fiscal 2025 Energy-Water bill at the last minute. So far this year, it has not derailed Republicans’ aggressive push to pass appropriations bills on the floor.

But the disagreements over funding levels and the role the government should play in propping up various forms of energy underscore the challenge congressional leaders are up against in trying to strike deals to keep the government funded in a narrowly divided Congress.

Some of the intraparty fights have been somewhat symbolic, with Republicans pushing amendments that have no chance of passing to make a point.

Rep. David Schweikert (R-Ariz.) pushed a failed proposal to reduce energy and water funding by $37 billion and said many of the programs he was targeting “I actually don’t oppose.”

“It’s not about liking the appropriation,” Schweikert said. “It’s about budgetary discipline.”

But the dissonance is likely not helpful as congressional leaders look to put on a united front amid broader government funding talks. Democrats are already incensed at House Republicans for pursuing partisan bills.

One senior Democratic appropriator walked out of the House chamber after the vote on the Energy-Water bill Thursday shaking her head at what she perceived as Republican dysfunction.

“I wish the people who are the principle [critics of the spending bills] would cave earlier so we can all go home,” said House Appropriations ranking member Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.).

“In the long run, that’s what they always do,” DeLauro said. “This is just a charade.”

The Senate has passed three fiscal 2026 spending bills on the floor, all with bipartisan support. The upper chamber did not make any progress on appropriations this week, but the Senate Appropriations Committee is expected to meet next week to try to advance two more bills.

Bucking cuts to energy assistance

House Republican appropriators are advancing fiscal 2026 bills with steep cuts to Democratic priorities, but they have at times rejected the conservative funding levels the White House requested in its fiscal 2026 budget proposal.

The latest example came this week, when the House Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations Subcommittee advanced its spending bill with a $10 million increase to the popular Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, despite the fact that President Donald Trump wants to eliminate it.

Still, the Labor-HHS-Education bill would scrap funding for some of the Democrats’ favored climate and health programs and cut $40 million from the Department of Labor’s Mine Safety and Health Administration.

“The bill supports the Trump Administration’s efforts to eliminate out-of-touch progressive policies, ends the weaponization of government, preserves parental rights, and upholds the right to life,” said House Appropriations Chair Tom Cole (R-Okla.). “Each dollar is directed toward initiatives that truly help our communities, students, families, and workforce.”

The Senate’s version of the bill, which advanced out of committee with bipartisan support, would increase funding for LIHEAP by $20 million over the enacted level and generally maintain funding for the Mine Safety and Health Administration.

Both bills include more than $1 billion for environmental health programs administered by HHS. There are also provisions directing work on disaster resilience.

Ford plant, ESG under attack

The House Appropriations Committee advanced its Financial Services-General Government bill Wednesday after a day-long markup in which Republicans approved a number of amendments targeting Democratic climate priorities.

A GOP amendment package, adopted 32-28, included a provision that, if enacted, could effectively bar the federal government from buying vehicles from Ford and potentially Tesla — two of the most iconic and successful American automakers. Both have major plants in Republic-led districts.

The amendment would prohibit the General Services Administration from purchasing vehicles from any entity that has a contract or licensing agreement with certain Chinese companies, including Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL), due to national security concerns. The Department of Defense has labeled CATL a Chinese military company, a description that CATL disputes.

Ford is licensing CATL technology for its Blue Oval battery manufacturing plant in a Michigan congressional district represented by Republican Rep. Tim Walberg.

The GSA owns and leases thousands of Ford vehicles and even purchased Ford electric trucks for use in Michigan parks during the Biden administration.

Republicans have hammered Ford for its decision to use the Chinese technology and worked to get Ford to end the agreement. CATL has reportedly worked with Tesla to provide faster charging batteries, meaning Tesla could be impacted, too, if the language becomes law. The EV maker is owned by Republican ally and donor Elon Musk.

Ford declined to provide a comment for this story. CATL did not respond to a request for comment.

The amendment package also contained two provisions adding new scrutiny to the practice of using environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria in making financial decisions.

The amendment added new language to the bill report noting that the “Committee is concerned with the consideration of [ESG] criteria in bond markets and debt financing.”

It would require the SEC to issue a report outlining “the extent to which such practices may constrain a state’s or public entity’s ability to access capital and finance their debt.”

GOP blocks additional energy cuts

Thursday’s votes on the Energy-Water bill were the latest examples of the intraparty tensions among Republicans when it comes to energy and environment provisions.

Rep. Chuck Fleischmann (R-Tenn.), chair of the Energy-Water Appropriations Subcommittee, pushed back on several amendments proposed by his Republican colleagues to water down his $57.3 billion bill.

He led the opposition against a number of Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Scott Perry’s amendments seeking to reduce funding for regional commissions and to eliminate funding for various programs at the Department of Energy.

Perry requested votes on amendments that would have zeroed out money for DOE’s advanced energy research arm, blocked funding for the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program and slashed the Loan Programs Office.

Fleischmann also spearheaded the bipartisan opposition to amendments that would have completely cut funds for DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), as well as Schweikert’s proposal to reduce the bill’s overall top line by $37 billion.

“I respectfully think my colleague’s amendment goes too far in eliminating this program,” Fleischmann said while noting that his bill would still cut EERE’s funding roughly in half.

“I think EERE is an [office] we all can support,” he said. “The reductions are there, and I think this strikes a very good balance.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/39/3d/f418e1a148a18815357c5a356ea6/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/1690945483,N,,2025-09-06 02:00:14.377378

SEA recommended to approve the project in its consolidated report published this week, documents show.

The project entails two main terminals in the city of Copiapó: a clean bulk facility with expected capacity of 10 million metric tons per year (t/y), and a multipurpose terminal with capacity for 300,000 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU) per year, 150,000t/y of general cargo, and 150,000t/y of fertilizers.

Other components include a desalination plant with capacity for 50 liters per second, a 60km-long 110kv transmission line, and a 50km-long water adduction pipeline to transport 20 liters per second.

Construction is expected to begin on February 2026.

Local opposition

The project is opposed by social and environmental organizations in Atacama region, who allege it will have negative impacts on local ecosystems.

“The approval of the Copiaport-e project shows the State and its services’ incoherence and fundamental incapacity to protect a highly ecologically relevant are of the sea and the Atacama coast,”environmental group CODEMAA (Atacama environment defense collective) said in a letter adressed to environment minister Maisa Rojas.

These and other issues have kept tensions high in Washington, but Republicans in and out of Congress largely remain behind President Trump.","Tariff Litigation.

On August 7th, the Trump administration’s reciprocal tariffs (ranging from 15% to 50%) on over 90 countries went into effect. Later in the month, a federal appeals court upheld a lower court’s ruling that those reciprocal tariffs were unconstitutional. The case now will be appealed to the Supreme Court by the Trump administration. Since, under the normal process, a ruling wouldn’t be made until later next spring, the Trump administration has pressed for expedited consideration. The appeals court’s decision allows the tariffs to stay in place until mid-October, and the Supreme Court could grant a similar stay to allow them to stay in place while it makes its decision. A ruling against the reciprocal tariffs by the Supreme Court would blow a big hole in the Trump administration’s trade strategy. The administration has imposed sectoral and other tariffs under other legal authorities, and could pivot to rely more on those. However, it would be more complicated and time-consuming to apply tariffs on such a broad basis.

Another Reconciliation Bill?

The final version of the “One Big Beautiful Bill” increased the deficit by $4 trillion, roughly $600 billion more than the version passed by the House. Some House Republicans have been frustrated by this differential and are pushing for another reconciliation bill focusing on deficit reduction. There will be noise about this in the coming weeks. However, we believe that these efforts will fall short as most Republicans, most notably President Trump, are not on board with a deficit reduction bill of this size.

Another Tax Bill?

If there is another reconciliation bill, there will be interest in having it include additional tax measures, though President Trump generally succeeded in getting his tax priorities into the “One Big Beautiful Bill.” Beyond reconciliation, there is some potential for a bipartisan tax bill later this year. During COVID, Congress expanded the eligibility for households with income above 400% of the federal poverty line to claim health insurance premium tax credits. These are set to expire at the end of the year. Some sort of renewal of this policy could serve as the basis for a bipartisan tax bill, though we are pessimistic about something significant materializing.

Nomination Frustration.

The confirmation of Trump administration nominees continues to be a hot topic given that the Senate has 130 nominations still outstanding. Senate Republicans are frustrated that Democrats have used Senate procedures to slow down the process. It’s not uncommon for the minority party in the Senate to take these measures, though it is less common with lower-level and relatively noncontroversial nominees. There are ongoing discussions about making certain procedural changes to speed up the process. Proposals include shortening the amount of debate time that must elapse between a procedural vote and a final vote, as well as reducing the number of executive branch roles subject to Senate confirmation. Senate Republicans could invoke the “nuclear option” by changing Senate rules with a simple majority vote. These discussions are fluid and we think there is a good chance that Senate Republicans will make changes to expedite approval of nominations.

Fed Drama.

For months, the Federal Reserve and its Chairman Jay Powell have been targets of President Trump. The president has jawboned the Fed on cutting interest rates and has complained about the cost of a renovation of the Fed’s facilities. More recently, President Trump took the unprecedented step of trying to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook (on the grounds of alleged mortgage fraud). The attempted firing is now the subject of lengthy litigation that is likely to go up to the Supreme Court. Economists and others have expressed concerns that the attacks on the Fed could erode its independence and therefore credibility. This issue provided the backdrop of a Senate hearing on the nomination of Stephen Miran (currently serving as head of the Council of Economic Advisors) to fill a temporary vacancy at the Federal Reserve. Republicans are trying to quickly push through Miran’s nomination. The bigger change will come in May when Chairman Powell’s term expires. President Trump has made no secret of his interest in replacing Powell and could name a replacement for Powell well in advance of May. In the meantime, the intrigue and criticism will continue.

Tensions Flaring.

Since Congress recessed at the end of July, a number of issues have stoked tension between the two parties (and sometimes within the parties). There will continue to be calls and efforts by many lawmakers to force the release of all files related to Jeffrey Epstein. Additionally, President Trump’s use of the National Guard in Washington to combat crime and his threat to use the guard in other cities has divided lawmakers along party lines. Other controversies include the aforementioned legal fight regarding the firing of Fed Governor Cook and questions about HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s leadership after his firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez and changes to vaccination policies. These and other issues have kept tensions high in Washington, but Republicans in and out of Congress largely remain behind President Trump.

Government in the Boardroom.

In a departure from traditional US economic policy, the federal government has taken direct equity stakes in private companies, most notably the conversion of prior grants into a 10% share in Intel last month. The Trump administration has expressed interest in starting a sovereign wealth fund and having the government become a shareholder in more US companies, with defense contractors being eyed as the government is their main customer. While this isn’t the first time the US government has invested in private companies, many of the prior instances (e.g. investments in banks and auto companies during the financial crisis) were structured differently and intended to be temporary. While the Trump administration’s investments are outside of traditional Republican economic orthodoxy, some progressives have praised these efforts. As the line between private and public blurs, the coming years will test both the ambition and limits of this ""government as stakeholder"" model.

Congressional Stock Trading?

The buzz around Congress and the long-debated issue of stock trading by lawmakers continues. While this issue has arisen before, there’s now a growing set of bipartisan bills aimed at limiting, or banning, Members of Congress from trading stock. Comprehensive legislation introduced this week would force Members of Congress (and their families) to divest or use blind trusts. It would impose those same strictures on the President and Vice President, though, as currently written, these requirements only would apply to future presidents and vice presidents. Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) and Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) have both conveyed qualified support for legislation to prevent Members of Congress from stock trading, but that’s not a guarantee they’ll support this particular effort. This is especially the case if President Trump comes out against the bill. The bill’s sponsors argue that the public’s overwhelming support (86% according to recent polls) makes an eventual ban inevitable. While Congress’s near-term preoccupation will be government funding, this issue could boil over towards the end of the year.",https://www.ubs.com/us/en/wealth-management/washington-weekly/2025/washington-weekly-5-september/_jcr_content/root/pagehead/opengraphimage.1423544471.img/washington-weekly-c.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 08:59:55.275446

Hyundai said the detainments will not impact car production at the factory.

Hyundai's Savannah, Georgia Metaplant is the South Korean automaker's newest and arguably most important factory ever, making the Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 9 electric SUVs on American soil. Today, however, it was the site of the largest-ever Homeland Security enforcement operation at a single location.

Earlier today, the 16 million square-foot factory was raided by law enforcement officers, including those from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, who arrested about 475 people. Most were South Korean nationals who were not in the country legally, according to multiple news reports.

In a statement to InsideEVs, Hyundai Motor America officials confirmed that none of the workers detained were employed by the Korean automaker. Instead, they seem to have been working for LG Energy Solution, which co-owns the plant with Hyundai and operates its nearby battery facility.

""We are closely monitoring the situation while working to understand the specific circumstances,"" Hyundai officials said. ""Based on our current understanding, none of those detained is directly employed by Hyundai Motor Company.""

The automaker added: ""Hyundai is committed to full compliance with all laws and regulations in every market where we operate. This includes employment verification requirements and immigration laws. We expect the same commitment from all our partners, suppliers, contractors, and subcontractors.""

A Hyundai spokesperson said that vehicle assembly at the plant will not be affected by today's arrests.

Hyundai officials said the company is ""reviewing our processes to ensure that all parties working on our projects maintain the same high standards of legal compliance that we demand of ourselves. This includes thorough vetting of employment practices by contractors and subcontractors."" It was not immediately clear why the EV and battery manufatcuring site was targeted by the Trump administration.

Today's raid comes as the Trump administration continues to dramatically step up immigration-related detentions, arrests and deportations across the country. While Trump campaigned on a promise to deport criminals and ""the worst of the worst,"" many such raids have implicated scores of people who have not been accused of crimes. According to a New York Times report, an attorney for at least two detained suspects today in Georgia said they were in the United States on a visa waiver program that allows stays of 90 days or less for business.

The Times report indicated that Korean companies often bring their own technicians on-site to help set up new operations, as they have the training to do such work. But one immigration lawyer said U.S. visa laws are not properly set up to sponsor trained workers to run those factories.

However, ICE officials said in a statement that the raid was part of ""an active, ongoing criminal investigation.""

""The individuals arrested during the operation were found to be working illegally, in violation of the terms of their visas and/or statuses,"" ICE officials said. ""People on short-term or recreational visas are not authorized to work in the U.S. A green card holder from Mexico was arrested after being determined to be removable from the U.S. based on multiple criminal convictions.""

Hyundai's Metaplant is perhaps the automaker's most important effort to bolster manufacturing in the U.S., its largest and most important market. It is also the largest economic development project in Georgia's history. The scale of the project, and its planned 14,000 manufacturing jobs, have been hailed as a win by Democrats and Republicans alike. Hyundai also announced this year that the plant can make hybrid cars, amid potential concerns about electric demand following the end of the federal EV tax credits later this month.

""The safety and well-being of everyone working at our sites, whether directly employed by us or working for our suppliers, is a top priority,"" Hyundai officials said. ""We take our responsibility as a corporate citizen seriously, and incidents like this remind us of the importance of robust oversight throughout our entire supply chain and contractor network.""",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/L3XXmN/s1/hyundai-metaplant-top.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 23:58:32.927404

Outer Continental Shelf, effectively terminating federal plans for offshore wind development across more than 3.5 million acres of ocean waters.
These projections now face uncertainty as the Trump administration reverses the previous administration’s goal of deploying 30 gigawatts of offshore wind capacity by 2030.
The Interior Department promised “more meaningful consultation” with tribes, fishing communities, and coastal towns regarding any future offshore energy development.
The administration’s actions represent a significant policy reversal from federal offshore wind development that had been planned and studied since 2014.","The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management announced this week it has rescinded all designated Wind Energy Areas on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf, effectively terminating federal plans for offshore wind development across more than 3.5 million acres of ocean waters.

The sweeping decision eliminates 11 previously designated areas spanning multiple regions, including the Gulf of America, North Carolina coast, Gulf of Maine, Oregon, and California’s Morro Bay. The canceled zones include four areas off Texas and Louisiana, three off North Carolina, approximately 2 million acres in New England waters, and two floating wind areas totaling 195,000 acres off Oregon.

“By rescinding WEAs, BOEM is ending the federal practice of designating large areas of the OCS for speculative wind development,” the agency stated in its announcement.

The action follows Interior Secretary Doug Burgum’s Order 3437, which aims to end “preferential treatment for unreliable, foreign controlled energy sources” in federal decision-making. This builds on President Trump’s January 20 presidential memorandum that temporarily withdrew all Outer Continental Shelf areas from offshore wind leasing.

The offshore wind industry had projected $65 billion in investments by 2030, supporting an estimated 56,000 jobs with significant benefits for U.S. shipbuilding and maritime operations. These projections now face uncertainty as the Trump administration reverses the previous administration’s goal of deploying 30 gigawatts of offshore wind capacity by 2030.

Commercial fishing groups have welcomed the decision. The New England Fishermen’s Stewardship Association and other fishing organizations have long argued that offshore wind projects disrupt marine ecosystems and traditional fishing grounds. Fishermen have raised concerns about electromagnetic fields from underwater cables affecting lobster larvae and turbine-related water disturbances impacting fish populations.

The decision also addresses concerns about whale mortality along the East Coast, which some fishing advocates have linked to offshore wind surveying activities.

While existing lease rights remain unaffected, the order mandates comprehensive review of current wind energy leases for potential termination or amendment. The Interior Department promised “more meaningful consultation” with tribes, fishing communities, and coastal towns regarding any future offshore energy development.

Just remember that it’ll take years before the effects of this capacity increase start to shave down your energy bills.
When Will Power Bills Come Back Down?
Analysts are forecasting investments in America’s national grid to balloon energy bills right into 2030.","Better infrastructure should make transmission cheaper in the future. But for now, these upgrades are going to make your bills more expensive.

Although the DoE has agreed to help out a little bit, power companies are still spending billions trying to upgrade regional systems piece by piece. To keep shareholders from jumping ship, they're passing the cost of upgrades directly onto monthly rate payers.

Worst of all, these projects have multi-year pipelines and costs tend to spiral. Permitting delays, equipment shortages, and tariffs imposed by the Trump administration have slowed upgrade efforts in many parts of the country.

That means these expansion efforts aren’t going to come to fruition anytime soon. Instead, they’ll just continue to inflate your electricity bills.

Demand Has Ballooned

There are some amazing tech innovations disrupting daily life. Huge data centers, AI, and a steady rise in electric vehicle uptake have pushed demand for electricity higher than ever.

Earlier this year, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) issued a new consumption forecast warning it expects a 1.7% annual rise in demand over the next two years.

That doesn’t look like a huge rise at first glance. But zoom in for some extra context, and you’ll see that U.S. electricity consumption only increased by around 0.1% between 2005 and 2020. So that 1.7% rise is actually a dramatic shift.

Average temperatures have continued to climb, which will push up demand for cooling systems and heat pumps. A lot of these systems guzzle electricity, which will create further supply imbalances.

What Is the Trump Admin Saying About Power Bills?

Earlier this week, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright told reporters that tackling soaring electricity prices was his top concern. So, what is the Trump administration actually doing to bring prices down?

Aside from the usual political blame game, there’s been a huge pivot in recent months away from clean energy.

The DoE has canceled offshore wind funding and pulled billions in green energy grants. The administration has also rewritten tax credits and torn apart energy-efficiency standards like ENERGY STAR.

Instead, it’s promoting a return to “big beautiful coal” and natural gas (NGV25) to fuel American power plants.

Over 4.3 GW of natural gas generation projects have now been started or are in pre-construction. That’s more than twice the amount of natural gas generation projects that were built last year — and developers are planning to bring four new power plants online to add a total of 18.7 GW by 2028.

These capacity increases should have the desired effect (eventually).

These projects will likely create a positive tailwind for billpayers when they come to fruition. Just remember that it’ll take years before the effects of this capacity increase start to shave down your energy bills. So in the meantime, billpayers don’t have a whole lot to look forward to.

When Will Power Bills Come Back Down?

This isn’t an answer families are going to want to hear. But no one’s expecting energy bills to come down in the short term — and by short term, we’re not talking about the next few months. We’re talking about the next three years.

Analysts are forecasting investments in America’s national grid to balloon energy bills right into 2030. These big infrastructure projects take a long time. Network upgrade costs will keep trickling down to rate payers until utility companies start to realize a profit on those investments.

And while production capacity is set to increase significantly over the next three years, the U.S. is simultaneously consolidating its reliance on natural gas as its primary source of electricity generation. There’s an inherent risk there, and it'll probably hurt prices in the short term.

The Trump administration and the DoE are keen to increase domestic production of natural gas throughout Trump’s second term, and this could push prices down a bit. But there are also geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic factors at play that'll likely drive prices right back up.

Based on everything that’s happened over the last five years, nobody expects a glorious return to the era of cheap gas anytime this decade.

Of course, there’s a bit of a ZIP code lottery here, too. Some energy customers might see regional variations in prices thanks to local energy mixes or regulatory changes. If you're lucky, that could work in your favor.

But generally speaking, most of us just need to adapt. Energy bills are going to keep outpacing inflation. All signs indicate this is going to be the new normal for the next three to five years. So, your best bet at reducing your bills is to focus on improving your own individual energy efficiency.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/0xB7usf3IrI3kYKgHGyypw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/barchart_com_477/6c242dade169cad237b60f738ee1cf7f,N,,2025-09-06 03:00:27.823295

Federal agents walked into a massive Hyundai and LG Energy Solutions construction site yesterday and detained nearly 500 people on suspected immigration offenses. The site, near Savannah, Georgia, is the home of a future electric vehicle battery plant. On Instagram, video posted by an account with the name Alex Morales showed a group of people listening to a masked man who identifies himself as part of Homeland Security.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED DHS OFFICER: We need construction to cease immediately. We need all work to end on the site right now.

DETROW: Homeland Security Investigations says this was the largest single-site operation they have ever carried out. NPR's Camila Domonoske covers cars for NPR and joins us now. Hey there.

CAMILA DOMONOSKE, BYLINE: Hi.

DETROW: What do we know about this workplace raid so far?

DOMONOSKE: Yeah. So Homeland Security Investigations, which is the branch of ICE that carries out this kind of workplace raid, they say that they detained 475 people, most of them South Korean. Hyundai and LG Energy Solutions - both of those companies are headquartered in South Korea. Here's Special Agent Steven Schrank speaking at a press conference.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

STEVEN SCHRANK: Some that illegally crossed the border into the United States, some that came in through visa waiver and were prohibited from working, some that had visas and overstayed their visas.

DETROW: So who was employing the people who were detained?

DOMONOSKE: It's a good question. You know, in a project like this, there are really complicated webs of subcontractors and subcontractors to subcontractors. Hyundai says that it believes that nobody detained was directly employed by Hyundai Motor Company. LG Energy Solutions hasn't responded to NPR's requests for comment.

That Homeland Security official said that this raid was tied to, quote, ""allegations of unlawful employment practices and serious federal crimes,"" end quote. He did not provide more details on that, and there are no charges filed in this case right now. Officials say this is an ongoing investigation. It would be unusual if charges are eventually filed because immigration raids like this, where workers are detained - they don't often end with criminal charges for employers.

DETROW: Tell us more about where this raid happened.

DOMONOSKE: It's on this huge campus of buildings near Savannah, Georgia, that also includes a large factory where Hyundai is right now building electric vehicles. That factory was not directly affected by the raid. Production of vehicles didn't actually stop. But the battery plant that's under construction nearby, which is where the raid actually happened - it's an important part of the long-term plans for this facility 'cause the goal is to build not just electric vehicles, but the whole supply chain for these vehicles here in the U.S.

And that's important not just to Hyundai, but actually to the United States more broadly in this effort to try to compete with China over the future of electric vehicles. So Hyundai is investing some $26 billion in moving manufacturing to the U.S., including this project. It's a big deal for the company and for Georgia. The state's called it the largest economic development project in state history.

DETROW: And I understand you just heard back from Hyundai. What did they say?

DOMONOSKE: They said they're going to conduct an investigation into suppliers and their subcontractors to make sure they are all following employment law and other laws and regulations. Meanwhile, Congressman Buddy Carter, who represents the area surrounding the plant, posted on X that he applauded the Trump administration for taking bold action. And the South Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs says it voiced concerns to the United States about respecting South Korean economic activity and citizens.

Oklo Announces Fuel Recycling Facility as First Phase of up to $1.68 Billion Advanced Fuel Center in Tennessee

Nation’s first privately funded facility to recycle used nuclear fuel will help reduce costs, create jobs, and establish a durable U.S. fuel supply.

Oklo Inc. (NYSE: OKLO) an advanced nuclear technology company,announced plans to design, build, and operate a fuel recycling facility in Tennessee as the first phase of an advanced fuel center.

The firm will organize an investment totaling up to $1.68 billion. The initial investment will be for the construction of a facility to recycle used nuclear fuel into fuel for fast reactors like Oklo’s Aurora powerhouse advanced reactor.

The recycling facility will recover usable fuel material from used nuclear fuel and fabricate it into fuel for advanced reactors. This process can reduce waste volumes for more economical, clean, and efficient disposal pathways.

The fuel recycling facility is the first phase of Oklo’s broader advanced fuel center, a multi-facility campus aimed at supporting recycling and fuel fabrication.

Oklo is also exploring opportunities with the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to recycle the utility’s used fuel at the new facility and to evaluate potential power sales from future Oklo powerhouses in the region to TVA.

Oklo has completed a licensing project plan for the fuel recycling facility with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and is currently in pre-application engagement with the regulator’s staff.

The facility in Tennessee is expected to begin producing metal fuel for Aurora powerhouses by the early 2030s, following regulatory review and approvals.

This collaboration would mark the first time a U.S. utility has explored recycling its used fuel into clean electricity using modern electrochemical processes, turning a legacy liability into a resource while creating a secure fuel supply for the future.

“Fuel is the most important factor in bringing advanced nuclear energy to market,” said Jacob DeWitte, Oklo co-founder and CEO.

“By recycling used fuel at scale, we are turning waste into gigawatts, reducing costs, and establishing a secure U.S. supply chain that will support the deployment of clean, reliable, and affordable power.”

The more than 94,000 metric tons of used nuclear fuel stored at power plant sites around the country contain considerable reserves of recyclable fuel. The energy that can be unlocked from this material via recycling is equivalent to about 1.3 trillion barrels of oil, or five times the reserves of Saudi Arabia.

Separately, in July, Oklo successfully completed pre-application readiness assessment for Phase 1 of the combined license application for Oklo’s first commercial Aurora powerhouse.

Oklo CEO and Co-founder Jacob DeWitte at the announcement of Oklo’s planned advanced nuclear fuel center in Oak Ridge, TN, with the Governor of Tennessee Bill Lee, the Commissioner of the Department of Economic and Community Development Stuart C. McWhorter, United States Senators from Tennessee Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty, Nuclear Regulatory Commission Commissioner Bradley Crowell, and Member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Tennessee’s 3rd district Chuck Fleischmann.

“Tennessee is well positioned to lead America’s energy independence, which is why we created the Nuclear Energy Fund to support and expand our state’s nuclear ecosystem. We’re proud to partner with Oklo to innovate for the future, while bringing continued opportunity and prosperity to Tennessee families,” said Governor Bill Lee.

Oklo Claims to Have a Fuel Recycling Process. How does it Work?

Oklo’s nuclear fuel recycling process is a type of pyroprocessing that uses an electrochemical process to separate usable fuel from spent nuclear waste. This technology, which is being developed in collaboration with U.S. national laboratories, allows Oklo to extract more than 90% of the remaining energy from used fuel and turn it into new fuel for its advanced fast reactors, like the Aurora powerhouse.

How the Process Works

Oklo’s process differs from traditional aqueous reprocessing methods because it’s a dry process that doesn’t use large amounts of water or chemical solvents. Instead, it involves electrorefining, a technique that has been demonstrated at the Idaho National Laboratory’s (INL) Fuel Conditioning Facility.

Electrorefining

In this process, used nuclear fuel is submerged in a bath of molten salt. An electrical current is then applied to the salt, which causes the usable elements in the fuel, like uranium and transuranics (e.g., plutonium), to migrate and collect on a cathode. This process separates the reusable material from the highly radioactive fission products, which remain in the molten salt.

Fuel Fabrication

The separated material, which is a mixture of uranium and transuranics, is then fabricated into new metal fuel for Oklo’s fast reactors. The process is designed to be proliferation-resistant because it keeps the transuranic materials together and doesn’t create a pure stream of plutonium.

Waste Reduction

By recycling the fuel, Oklo significantly reduces the volume of high-level radioactive waste that needs to be stored long-term, making disposal more economical and efficient.

This recycling technology is a key part of Oklo’s business model, aiming to provide a secure domestic fuel supply, reduce costs, and convert what is currently a liability—used nuclear fuel—into a valuable resource for generating clean energy.

Technical Challenges to Commercialization

While pyroprocessing has a strong historical foundation, its demonstration at the EBR-II was at a laboratory scale. Scaling this process to an industrial level for commercial operation is a major technical and financial hurdle.

The process operates in an extremely harsh environment, with high temperatures of 500-700°C and highly corrosive molten salts. The entire operation must be conducted remotely within heavily shielded “hot cells” due to the extreme radioactivity of the materials, adding significant complexity and cost to the facility’s design and operation.

Economic Viability and Cost

Oklo’s narrative of “reducing costs” stands in contrast to a broader academic and expert debate about the economic viability of reprocessing. Research indicates that reprocessing is not currently cost-competitive with the “once-through” fuel cycle, particularly with today’s low uranium prices.

Oklo’s economic model does not appear to be based on the immediate market value of the recovered uranium, but rather on a long-term strategic value proposition. The model implicitly places a significant value on a closed fuel cycle and the elimination of a long-term waste management liability, making it a bet on future market conditions and regulatory frameworks rather than on present economic realities.

Kairos Power And BWXT MOU on Commercial Triso Manufacturing

The Kairos Power-BWXT team will work together to explore opportunities for the optimization of commercial production of TRISO fuel for Hermes 2 and future commercial reactors

Kairos Power and BWX Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: BWXT) announced an agreement to collaboratively explore technical and process opportunities for the optimization of commercial production of TRISO nuclear fuel to supply Kairos Power’s advanced reactor fleet and other potential customers.

The arrangement will bring together Kairos Power’s established capabilities in annular graphite pebble production with BWXT’s more than 20 years of experience in TRISO fuel manufacturing and will consider possible paths to deliver fuel for the Hermes 2 Demonstration Plant and subsequent Kairos Power reactor deployments.

Kairos Power’s Fluoride Salt-Cooled High-Temperature Reactor (KP-FHR) uses TRISO fuel embedded in annular graphite pebbles roughly the size of a golf ball.

Under the collaboration agreement, the joint team will explore opportunities to utilize the state-of-the-art TRISO Development Lab (TDL) at Kairos Power’s Albuquerque campus, the BWXT Innovation Campus in Lynchburg, Virginia, and BWXT’s existing TRISO production line to optimize TRISO fuel manufacturing and process automation.

The companies have also agreed to explore opportunities to jointly develop a TRISO fuel fabrication facility, which would incorporate this experience and knowledge, along with newly developed technology for commercial fuel production.

This combined fuel manufacturing knowledge and expertise creates the opportunity to develop efficient and cost-effective mass-produced TRISO coated particle fuel to support Kairos Power’s commercial scale-up and lower fuel costs for the advanced reactor industry.

TRISO (TRi-structural ISOtropic) particle fuel is a proven technology developed by the U.S. Department of Energy, which has dubbed it “the most robust nuclear fuel on earth.” Each TRISO particle is made up of a uranium, carbon, and oxygen fuel kernel encapsulated by three layers of carbon- and ceramic-based materials that prevent the release of radioactive fission products. By combining TRISO fuel with molten fluoride salt coolant, Kairos Power’s advanced reactor technology achieves robust inherent safety in a simplified, compact design.

US Uranium Unveils UF6 Conversion Facility Plans

(WNN) The proposed facility – which UEC says will be the largest conversion facility in the USA and “amongst the most modern in the Western world” – is envisaged as having a designed capacity to produce some 10,000 tU per year as UF6, representing a “substantial share” of the USA’s 18,000 tU per year demand.

The proposed facility is the result of work initiated with Fluor Corporation in July 2024 and supported by a recently completed AACE Class 5 conceptual study. UEC said it has initiated discussions on potential siting options, “evaluating factors such as logistics, workforce availability, public acceptance, local incentives, and synergies with other fuel cycle facilities.”

“The project will move forward contingent on several factors, including completion and assessment of additional engineering and economic studies, securing strategic government commitments, utility contracts, regulatory approvals, and favorable market conditions,” the company said.

“UEC has begun initial discussions with the United States government, state-level energy authorities, utilities, and financial entities, and will report further updates as these engagements advance.”

UEC Gets a New Name

Texas-headquartered UEC said the new company will be called United States Uranium Refining & Conversion Corp. (UR&C). Onshoring the nuclear fuel cycle is seen as a priority for national security.

“Positioning UEC as the only vertically integrated US company with uranium mining, processing, refining and conversion capabilities is both a significant commercial opportunity and a strategic necessity for the United States,” UEC President and CEO Amir Adnani said.

“UEC’s end-to-end capabilities would provide a secure, geopolitically reliable source of uranium hexafluoride – the feedstock needed for uranium enrichment to produce nuclear fuel – for “undersupplied domestic and allied markets.”

Conversion is a chemical process to refine U3O8 to uranium dioxide, which can then be converted into uranium hexafluoride gas. Honeywell’s Metropolis Works plant, built in the 1950s in southern Illinois, is currently the only uranium conversion facility in the USA. It was temporarily shut down from 2017 to 2023 due to poor market conditions, but was restarted in July 2023.

UEC has three hub and spoke in-situ recovery uranium platforms in South Texas and Wyoming with a combined licensed production capacity of 12.1 million pounds U3O8 (4654 tU) per year.

The facility will position UEC as the only American company with a nuclear fuel supply chain capability from uranium production to refining, conversion, and delivery of natural UF6, the company said.

High conversion prices in both the spot and long-term markets are “indicative of a highly undersupplied market and a major bottleneck in the US nuclear fuel supply chain, and market conditions, plus current federal government support, have created a “prime opportunity” for a US company to develop a new uranium refining and conversion plant, it added.

Fermi America Closes $350 Million in Series C Financing

Fermi America, developing the world’s largest, behind-the-meter artificial intelligence private grid campus (the “HyperGrid Project”), in partnership with the Texas Tech University System, announced the successful close of its $100 million Series C preferred equity financing round led by Macquarie Group, alongside the establishment of a $250 million senior loan facility, funded solely by Macquarie’s Commodities and Global Markets business, with $100 million drawn at close.

This financing marks a major milestone for Fermi America to secure long-lead supply chain assets..

The company said in its press statement the Series C equity round and senior loan facility “provide a strong foundation for Fermi America to continue locking up global long-lead time items, adding subject matter experts to the Fermi team, and constructing phase one of the HyperGrid Project.”

About the FERMI Project

The Texas Firm, led by former DOE Secretary Rick Perry plans to build four 1,150 MW (4.6 GW) Westinghouse AP1000 PWR type nuclear reactors at a 5,700 acre site adjacent to the NNSA Pantex nuclear weapons depot in Amarillo, TX, which is 360 miles northwest of Dallas, TX.

According to its press statement, the project is expected to have its first reactor, of the four, in revenue service by 2032. Until then the facility will rely on natural gas and solar energy for electricity. Amarillo is home to a large and productive gas field. The gas plants are quicker to build and construction of them can scale to electricity demand by the data centers until it is sufficient to justify building the reactors.

Given the timeline for a nuclear new build at this scale, it could be 2040 or later before all four reactors are in revenue service. The 2032 date provided by Fermi American for the first reactor is likely to be subject to change.

By partnering with the Texas Tech University, by leasing the site for 99 years, project developers will be able to leverage a legal authority of the State of Texas called “Sovereign Ovenership” which is expected to clear away delays related to water and mineral rights and local zoning.

The site is expected to host so-called hyperscale data centers based on “behind the meter connections” which will likely mean most of the power generated by the reactors will not go on the Texas electrical power grid. Amarillo is not part of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas. ERCOT, which covers most of the state.

Poland’s Orlen And Synthos Agree to Joint Venture for 1st BWRX-300 Nuclear Plant

Companies say Europe’s first small modular reactor will be built near city of Wloclawek

(NucNet) Polish companies Orlen and Synthos Green Energy (SGE) have agreed on a new operating model for their joint venture Orlen Synthos Green Energy (OSGE), paving the way for construction of Poland’s first BWRX-300 small modular reactor (SMR) near the central city of Wloclawek.

The new model means state-controlled energy company Orlen and privately owned SGE will each hold 50% of the shares and have equal rights in OSGE, including the ability to alternately appoint the chief executive officer and chairman.

Another element of the agreement is a licensing agreement that gives OSGE direct access to the BWRX-300 technology, developed by them US company GE Vernova (GEV).

The new OSGE structure introduces a steering committee responsible for overseeing project implementation and making operational decisions. The committee will also support the creation of additional special purpose vehicles responsible for the construction of additional reactors.

In December 2023, OSGE received a decision-in-principle for the construction of up to 24 SMRs at six potential sites across the country. Those six sites included Wloclawek.

Orlen Planning Up To 600 MW Of Capacity By 2035

In January 2024, Orlen laid out plans for deploying two reactors with about 600 MW of nuclear power capacity by 2035.

OSGE also signed an agreement with the Polish Data Center Association to explore the integration of SMRs with data centre infrastructure in Poland.

SGE chief executive officer Rafal Kasprów, who is also CEO of OSGE, told NucNet recently that SGE is building partnerships in Slovakia, Hungary, the Czech Republic and the UK as it seeks to expand its footprint and deploy new-generation reactors across Europe.

With peak electricity demand expected to grow and coal capacity rapidly exiting the system, Poland faces one of Europe’s most acute energy crises.

Kasprów said: “Poland can’t keep up with new consumption. We must replace coal with reliable baseload – and that’s what SMRs offer.”

The BWRX-300 is a 300-MW water-cooled, natural circulation SMR with passive safety systems. It is based on an existing boiling water reactor design – the ESBWR – that is licensed in the US.

NASA Posts Lunar Nuclear Plan with Commercial Focus

(Space News)(NASA) NASA is moving ahead with plans to support development of a lunar nuclear power system with an emphasis on commercialization.

On 08/29/25 the agency released a draft Announcement for Partnership Proposals, or AFPP, for its Fission Surface Power initiative to gather industry input for the final version.

The AFPP is designed to implement a policy directive signed July 31 by Acting Administrator Sean Duffy that seeks to accelerate work on nuclear power systems for the moon. The directive calls for a reactor capable of producing at least 100 kilowatts of power that would be ready for launch by the end of 2029.

NASA plans to pursue the effort through public-private partnerships using funded Space Act Agreements. While the directive called for selecting two companies, the draft AFPP states NASA can choose “one, multiple or none” of the proposals.

The draft provides few new details about NASA’s requirements. One, restated from the directive, is that the system will use a closed Brayton cycle power conversion system — a signal, industry officials said, that NASA wants the technology to scale to higher-power systems.

The reactor would operate in the lunar south polar region for at least 10 years. A cover letter accompanying the draft seeks input on issues including cybersecurity, physical security and reactor fuel.

Under the Space Act Agreement structure, the company would own the reactor and sell power to NASA and other customers. The AFPP requires proposers to submit a financing plan “showing how cash from operations, financing, and NASA covers the expenses of the total end-to-end deployment of the FSP system.”

Proposers must also provide a “Commercial Lunar Power Business Plan” outlining the strategy, potential customers and market size. “The market should include or leverage customers other than NASA,” the draft states.

That approach also extends to delivery. Companies may propose that NASA land the reactor on the moon, if it weighs no more than 15,000 kilograms. But the AFPP says companies “that propose a wholly commercial approach to the end-to-end deployment, all other things being equal, will receive higher-rated proposal evaluations.”

The draft does not state how much funding NASA expects to provide but says the final version, due no later than Oct. 3, will include that information. Awards are expected by March 2026.

INL Report on Space Nuclear Power Development

The directive followed a report commissioned by the Idaho National Laboratory that recommended accelerating space nuclear power development. One option in that report called for building a reactor of at least 100 kilowatts through traditional contracts; another proposed public-private partnerships for reactors of 10 to 100 kilowatts.",https://neutronbytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/x-energy-triso-fuel_thumb.png,N,,2025-09-06 02:00:32.219343

Why the BMW iX3 deserves your attention right now

This is not a concept locked behind velvet ropes it is the BMW iX3, the first Neue Klasse production model. It arrives at a moment when buyers are demanding more from electric vehicles than ever before. Long range, fast charging, and genuine usability are no longer luxuries; they are table stakes. Add in sustainability, smarter software, and a touch of wit, and BMW appears to have built an EV that feels both futuristic and familiar.

The timing could not be sharper. Government policies are tightening around emissions. Consumers are weighing EV purchases against charging infrastructure concerns. Competitors are sprinting to fill every possible niche. The iX3 lands as BMW’s declaration that it is not only in the EV race, but intends to lead it.

Why does this car matter right now?

BMW has spent years hinting at its Neue Klasse platform. Now the first real proof is here. The iX3 delivers an estimated 497 miles of range on the European test cycle. Translated for American roads, that’s a realistic 320 to 380 miles, enough for most drivers to go days without a charge. Dual motors produce 470 horsepower and 475 pound-feet of torque, launching the SUV from zero to sixty in under five seconds. It is quick enough to thrill enthusiasts yet refined enough for daily school runs.

Charging is equally compelling. A 10-to-80 percent DC fast charge takes just 21 minutes. With only 10 minutes plugged in, the iX3 can add about 217 miles of range. For those who dread wasting time at a charger, that is the difference between frustration and convenience. And unlike most rivals, the iX3 does not only take power, it gives it back. Bidirectional charging means it can power a home during an outage, support a laptop on the roadside, or keep the blender running at a campsite. This feature elevates the iX3 beyond transportation, turning it into a mobile energy source.

Inside, BMW has leaned into innovation without abandoning common sense. A 43-inch heads-up projection stretches across the windshield, serving speed, navigation, and alerts directly into the driver’s view. Below that, a 17.9-inch display is angled toward the driver. Yet unlike many competitors, BMW has not sacrificed tactile controls. Real buttons for climate, a physical volume roller, and switches that can be found by feel make the cabin usable without constant screen tapping. In an industry obsessed with minimalism, this combination feels refreshing.

How does it compare to rivals?

The iX3 enters a crowded premium EV market that includes the Tesla Model Y, Audi Q8 e-tron, and Mercedes EQE SUV. Tesla leads on software ecosystem and brand familiarity, but the BMW outpaces it in cabin design and material sustainability. Audi’s Q8 e-tron offers refined comfort but cannot match the iX3’s charging speed or bidirectional capability. Mercedes delivers luxury, yet its reliance on screens without physical controls can feel less intuitive.

Where BMW pulls ahead is in balance. The iX3 does not overwhelm with gimmicks. Its performance is competitive, its range practical, and its tech genuinely useful. A driver who has grown weary of learning new infotainment quirks may appreciate that BMW still values tactile interaction. Meanwhile, its projected range edges out most rivals in real-world comparisons, a point that matters more to American buyers than headline acceleration numbers.

Who is this for and who should skip it?

The iX3 is tailored for buyers who want an EV that feels like a natural upgrade rather than a radical leap. Families will appreciate the 62 cubic feet of cargo space and the 58-liter frunk, big enough for groceries or weekend bags. The 4,400-pound tow rating covers trailers, boats, or even a horse box. Daily commuters will enjoy the seamless integration of safety features: adaptive cruise control, lane keeping, and traffic light recognition. Long trips are made easier by range confidence and fast charging.

This SUV also suits environmentally conscious buyers. Nearly one-third of its materials are recycled. Seat fabrics are spun from PET plastic bottles, mats are crafted from salvaged fishing nets, and the aluminum used in construction is 80 percent reused. It is a clear statement that sustainability need not look or feel compromised.

Who should skip it? Drivers looking for the cheapest way into EV ownership will not find it here. The iX3 is a premium vehicle with premium pricing. Those who demand the absolute longest range in the industry may still gravitate toward Tesla’s upper-end models. And buyers uninterested in technology might find the dual-screen cabin excessive. For the majority, though, the iX3 strikes an enviable balance.

What is the long-term significance?

BMW calls the electronic control unit of the iX3 the “Heart of Joy.” It governs power delivery, regenerative braking, and steering inputs at speeds ten times faster than previous generations. The result is silky acceleration and braking so refined it feels almost apologetic. This is more than marketing; it is a glimpse at how BMW intends to differentiate its driving experience in the electric era.

Safety technology is equally forward-looking. The iX3 reads road signs, interprets driver behavior, and provides support without the heavy-handedness of some systems. It handles roundabouts, lane changes, and traffic signals with minimal fuss. Unlike many voice assistants, BMW’s new AI-driven system responds naturally and learns habits over time. It knows when to warm the seat or suggest a charging stop, without demanding constant prompts.

In the broader industry, the iX3 establishes Neue Klasse as BMW’s future backbone. Every upcoming model will draw from its template of high-range efficiency, rapid charging, sustainable materials, and intuitive software. For consumers, this means BMW’s EVs are no longer niche experiments but mainstream flagships.

The cultural impact should not be overlooked either. By designing an EV that balances NASA-like tech with familiar BMW touches, the company demonstrates that electric vehicles need not alienate long-time petrol drivers. Instead, they can feel aspirational and approachable at once. If competitors chase the same equilibrium, the EV transition may accelerate faster than predicted.

And if you want to take advantage of tax credits for electric vehicles, run over to the dealership right away.

Federal clean energy tax credits established or expanded under former President Biden’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act have been significantly curtailed by the recently passed tax legislation, which was signed into law in July 2025. The new law accelerates the expiration dates for many credits for both individuals and businesses.

Most of these credits had been set to expire at the end of 2032 or 2034. Now, they are set to expire at the end of this year, or in the case of EVs, the end of this month.

It’s important to note that you will need to pay for and complete the projects before the end of the year.

How Much Money Is at Stake?

These federal home energy tax credits have been instrumental in helping Americans lower their energy bills—and go green in the process.

One environmental group says that by taking advantage of these credits, the average household could cut their annual energy bills by over 70%, which for the average home is about $2,200 a year.

Most of the home improvement projects offer a 30 percent tax credit for the costs of qualifying clean energy systems. Most of these energy-efficient home projects are capped at $1,200; in some cases, the cap is $2,000.

Even after the federal credits expire, a number of state and local rebates will keep some incentive programs in place.

What’s Covered?

The tax credit covers a wide range of home improvement projects, everything from new water heaters to solar panels.

The credits also cover:

Energy-efficient doors, windows, and skylights

Furnaces, boilers, and central air conditioners

Electrical panel upgrades

Geothermal heat pumps, small wind turbines, fuel cells, and battery storage technology

For the most part, these projects must be done on your primary residence, which must be located in the United States. There are some exceptions for projects involving second homes and rentals.

Clean Vehicle Credits

The credit for new electric vehicles can be as high as $7,500, but under the new rules, you must take possession of the vehicle by September 30th.

There are a number of restrictions on which vehicles qualify.

They must undergo final assembly in the U.S., and there are restrictions on where the battery components and minerals come from.

The manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP) cannot exceed $80,000 for pickup trucks, SUVs, and vans, or $55,000 on all other vehicles.

Your Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) cannot exceed $300,000 for married couples filing jointly, $225,000 for heads of household, or $150,000 for all other filers.

The credit for used EVs is 30 percent of the sale price, up to $4,000.

For the full list of eligible vehicles, check the government website at fueleconomy.gov.

There is also a credit of 30 percent for the installation of a charging station costing up to $1,000.

The credit is applicable to both the purchase and lease of a qualifying electric vehicle. Technically, the credit belongs to the leasing company, but many will pass the credit on to the lessee. Additionally, the MAGI limitation does not apply to a leased vehicle, making this an attractive alternative to purchasing the car for those who would not qualify for the credit based on their MAGI being too high in the year they purchase the car. If you are going to lease the car, make sure the leasing company passes the credit on in the form of a rebate or reduced lease price.

How to Claim the Tax Credit

If you complete and pay for the project by the end-of-year deadline, you will need to file Form 5695, Residential Energy Credits Part II, with your 2025 tax return, which you will file in 2026.

For EVs, Consumer Reports says that most auto dealerships will apply the tax credit when you make the purchase. If not, you will need to file IRS Form 8936.

For many people, the desire to reduce their carbon footprint is reason enough to purchase an EV or make energy-efficient home improvements.

Earlier this week, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright told reporters that tackling soaring electricity prices was his top concern.
Just remember that it’ll take years before the effects of this capacity increase start to shave down your energy bills.","Let’s not beat around the bush here: We’re stuck in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis.

Everything is getting more expensive. And even though we’ve managed to keep inflation at or below 3% for quite a while now, one household cost that’s starting to get out of control is electricity.

The average residential electricity bill has surged by around 10% since January, easily outpacing inflation and causing serious worries for stretched billpayers. Almost three out of four Americans say they’re stressed about further price hikes on the horizon, and over half of billpayers don’t understand what’s driving prices.

So, what's pushing electricity prices up so high in 2025? And more importantly, when are power bills going to come back down? Let’s dive a bit deeper.

Why Are Electricity Bills So High?

Despite some regional variations, U.S. electricity bills are shooting up right across the board. Regulators have already approved a colossal $29 billion in rate hikes so far in 2025, and utility companies are still asking for more.

So, why do all of these electricity providers keep increasing rates? As you might expect, a lot of it centers on supply and demand.

America’s Power Grid Needs a Facelift

The biggest issue affecting your energy bills is infrastructure. America’s electrical grid is decades old in a lot of places, and it’s in desperate need of some upgrades to maintain adequate supply.

Extreme weather events are increasing in frequency across many parts of the country and putting a lot of stress on transmission systems. U.S. power plants are depreciating faster than anticipated, and analysts now estimate it'd cost up to $5 trillion to replace the entire grid.

Fortunately, there's some political will to get this done (sort of).

Last year, President Joe Biden’s administration pledged to kickstart $2.2 billion worth of improvements across 18 states, adding nearly 13 GW of capacity. The Department of Energy (DoE) has maintained this trajectory under President Donald Trump. It’s offering billions in grants and subsidies for utility providers keen to take on modernization efforts, and some upgrades have already started.

Better infrastructure should make transmission cheaper in the future. But for now, these upgrades are going to make your bills more expensive.

Although the DoE has agreed to help out a little bit, power companies are still spending billions trying to upgrade regional systems piece by piece. To keep shareholders from jumping ship, they're passing the cost of upgrades directly onto monthly rate payers.

Worst of all, these projects have multi-year pipelines and costs tend to spiral. Permitting delays, equipment shortages, and tariffs imposed by the Trump administration have slowed upgrade efforts in many parts of the country.

That means these expansion efforts aren’t going to come to fruition anytime soon. Instead, they’ll just continue to inflate your electricity bills.

Demand Has Ballooned

There are some amazing tech innovations disrupting daily life. Huge data centers, AI, and a steady rise in electric vehicle uptake have pushed demand for electricity higher than ever.

Earlier this year, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) issued a new consumption forecast warning it expects a 1.7% annual rise in demand over the next two years.

That doesn’t look like a huge rise at first glance. But zoom in for some extra context, and you’ll see that U.S. electricity consumption only increased by around 0.1% between 2005 and 2020. So that 1.7% rise is actually a dramatic shift.

Average temperatures have continued to climb, which will push up demand for cooling systems and heat pumps. A lot of these systems guzzle electricity, which will create further supply imbalances.

What Is the Trump Admin Saying About Power Bills?

Earlier this week, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright told reporters that tackling soaring electricity prices was his top concern. So, what is the Trump administration actually doing to bring prices down?

Aside from the usual political blame game, there’s been a huge pivot in recent months away from clean energy.

The DoE has canceled offshore wind funding and pulled billions in green energy grants. The administration has also rewritten tax credits and torn apart energy-efficiency standards like ENERGY STAR.

Instead, it’s promoting a return to “big beautiful coal” and natural gas (NGV25) to fuel American power plants.

Over 4.3 GW of natural gas generation projects have now been started or are in pre-construction. That’s more than twice the amount of natural gas generation projects that were built last year — and developers are planning to bring four new power plants online to add a total of 18.7 GW by 2028.

These capacity increases should have the desired effect (eventually).

These projects will likely create a positive tailwind for billpayers when they come to fruition. Just remember that it’ll take years before the effects of this capacity increase start to shave down your energy bills. So in the meantime, billpayers don’t have a whole lot to look forward to.

When Will Power Bills Come Back Down?

This isn’t an answer families are going to want to hear. But no one’s expecting energy bills to come down in the short term — and by short term, we’re not talking about the next few months. We’re talking about the next three years.

Analysts are forecasting investments in America’s national grid to balloon energy bills right into 2030. These big infrastructure projects take a long time. Network upgrade costs will keep trickling down to rate payers until utility companies start to realize a profit on those investments.

And while production capacity is set to increase significantly over the next three years, the U.S. is simultaneously consolidating its reliance on natural gas as its primary source of electricity generation. There’s an inherent risk there, and it'll probably hurt prices in the short term.

The Trump administration and the DoE are keen to increase domestic production of natural gas throughout Trump’s second term, and this could push prices down a bit. But there are also geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic factors at play that'll likely drive prices right back up.

Based on everything that’s happened over the last five years, nobody expects a glorious return to the era of cheap gas anytime this decade.

Of course, there’s a bit of a ZIP code lottery here, too. Some energy customers might see regional variations in prices thanks to local energy mixes or regulatory changes. If you're lucky, that could work in your favor.

But generally speaking, most of us just need to adapt. Energy bills are going to keep outpacing inflation. All signs indicate this is going to be the new normal for the next three to five years. So, your best bet at reducing your bills is to focus on improving your own individual energy efficiency.",,N,,2025-09-06 08:00:01.639716

If they prevail, they’ll drive up our energy costs, harm our health, and throttle our opportunities for local economic development.

The Trump administration has our clean energy economy in its crosshairs. Federal agencies are on a mission to find new bureaucratic means of stopping clean energy projects that are already financed and under construction or fully permitted. Meanwhile, the Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin has been meeting with political leaders in the northeast to demand that they concede to new gas pipelines thatdo not have financial support and are unlikely to reduce energy costs

If the administration and the fossil fuel industry get their way, New England families and businesses could be stuck with expensive bills to pay for gas infrastructure and price-volatile gas for years after Zeldin and President Trump are long gone.

In Connecticut, Governor Lamont doesn’t seem to grasp that investing in new gas pipelines would be costly and shortsighted. While Lamont supports the state’s climate goals, he has cravenly agreed with Trump’s demand to expand gas pipelines in the region. Lamont claims he’s responding to high electricity rates, but new gas pipelines are not the answer. In fact, investors have been unwilling to finance new pipelines in the region because they’re not a viable investment and there are no buyers for long-term gas contracts.

What Zeldin and Lamont seem to forget is that New England has been here before. In 2016, the region rejected a similar push for new gas pipelines. When the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled that it was not legal to charge electric customers for the high cost of a pipeline and the Maine utility regulator determined that the plan was not cost-effective, those plans fell like a house of cards.

What Lamont is really doing is bowing to pressure from Trump and the fossil fuel industry at the expense of the people he represents. Industry front groups with deceptive names like Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future and Consumers Energy Alliance are mobilizing in support of fossil fuels and attacking clean energy. They release pro-fossil fuel studies and surveys of questionable accuracy while receiving funding from fossil fuel companies, or in the case of Mass Fiscal Alliance, refusing to say who funds them.

Despite the fossil fuel industry’s attempts to strangle clean energy, deployment has exploded across the U.S. and globally. Nationally, solar, wind, and batteries dominate as we race to add new sources of electricity to meet growing demand. Solar is the cheapest and fastest growing source of energy in the U.S. and globally

But the transition to clean energy in the U.S. is not happening fast enough to reduce our reliance on volatile fossil fuels. The Trump administration is making things worse by taking unprecedented – and often illegal – actions to slow the transition and continue inflating the profits of fossil fuel companies, which already enjoy huge government subsidies.

The Trump administration’s support for fossil fuels is purely ideological and unbelievably myopic. Nationally, 90 percent of new capacity added to the grid is from solar and wind. In the winter, wind power – a free and local resource – ramps up just when we need it most. In summer, abundant sunshine makes solar an excellent source of power. During the heat wave that hit the region this summer, rooftop solar and batteries saved us from losing power – and saved consumers almost $20 million in fuel costs.

When the federal government does the bidding of multibillion dollar corporations while driving up costs for the average American, we need states to step up. Our state and local leaders have a responsibility to lead where this administration has failed us: by investing in clean, local, and affordable sources of energy, enabling families and businesses to access clean technologies that are more efficient and better for our health, and refuting Trump’s nonsensical claims that fossil fuels are the future.

According to America’s Clean Power, a renewable energy industry group, the offshore wind sector supports 25,000 jobs in the United States.
On Friday, Mr. Wright said that European nations powered by offshore wind turbines had high electricity prices.
Eric Hines, who directs the offshore wind energy graduate program at Tufts University, acknowledged that offshore wind projects currently required substantial subsidies to be successful.
Mr. Wright blamed what he described as a misplaced emphasis in the Biden administration on tackling climate change and promoting clean energy.","Energy Secretary Chris Wright on Friday defended the Trump administration’s decision to block a nearly completed $6.2 billion wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island by saying offshore wind increases electricity prices and by downplaying the jobs at stake.

Energy experts accused Mr. Wright of oversimplifying the economics of offshore wind energy, noting that while it requires a significant amount of upfront capital to build a project, it was expected to create more than 55,000 jobs by the end of the decade and enough electricity to inexpensively power 22 million homes before the Trump administration took steps to throttle the nascent industry.

A former fracking executive, Mr. Wright said the focus in the United States to transition away from fossil fuels had hurt the country. It’s a message he said he intended to take on a multileg trip next week to Europe, where he will encourage countries to buy more American gas. The United States is currently the world’s biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas as well as the largest producer of oil.

“Europe is in the midst of almost completely deindustrializing the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution,” Mr. Wright said, referring to Europe’s commitments to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that are heating the planet. He delivered those remarks on Friday to the Council on Foreign Relations, a Washington research organization.

He called the 2015 Paris agreement, in which the United States and nearly every other country pledged to reduce greenhouse gases, “silly.”

“Climate change, for impacting the quality of your life, is not incredibly important,” Mr. Wright said. “In fact, if it wasn’t in the news, in the media, you wouldn’t know.”

Hundreds of the world’s top scientists gathered by the United Nations have found that greenhouse gases from the burning of coal, oil and gas are heating the planet and already having profound effects on communities by increasing the frequency and intensity of heat waves, wildfires, drought, floods and other extreme weather.

Earlier this year Mr. Wright handpicked a group of people who reject the scientific consensus on climate change to write a report downplaying global warming. On Friday he argued that renewable energy projects developed with the aim of reducing fossil fuels were not beneficial to the United States.

He likened the Trump administration’s decision to throttle the offshore wind industry to the Keystone XL oil pipeline, which would have transported carbon-heavy oil from the Canadian oil sands to the Gulf Coast. Keystone was blocked by the Obama administration and later the Biden administration because of climate change concerns.

“The difference is, in that example, that’s a huge amount of oil that would be jobs for America,” Mr. Wright said.

According to America’s Clean Power, a renewable energy industry group, the offshore wind sector supports 25,000 jobs in the United States.

On Friday, Mr. Wright said that European nations powered by offshore wind turbines had high electricity prices. “We don’t want to be in the race for the most expensive electricity in the world,” he said. “We want to be in the race for the most affordable electricity in the world.”

Jesse Jenkins, an associate professor of energy at Princeton University, called Mr. Wright’s arguments facile.

“He’s doing the classic correlation equals causality,” Mr. Jenkins said. “The reasons these places have turned so heavily to renewables is that they lack access to cheap fossil fuels and they don’t want to have to rely entirely on imported resources.”

Mr. Jenkins said that Mr. Wright’s assertion that wind and solar had led to higher electricity prices in the United States was false. “There’s no evidence for that,” he said, adding that in many parts of the country, the opposite was true, with renewables lowering the cost of electricity.

Revolution Wind was expected to generate electricity for more than 350,000 homes at 9.8 cents per kilowatt-hour, a rate that would be locked in for 20 years and is cheaper than the average cost of electricity in New England, according to America’s Clean Power.

Eric Hines, who directs the offshore wind energy graduate program at Tufts University, acknowledged that offshore wind projects currently required substantial subsidies to be successful. But he argued that states had determined that offshore wind would bring significant benefits.

“There’s an opportunity for an enormous number of jobs that are sustainable, and an opportunity to build this infrastructure that can last for generations, at which point electricity will be far less expensive than anybody can imagine,” Mr. Hines said, referring to wind power.

Mr. Wright said the abrupt stop-work order for the Revolution Wind project in Rhode Island was issued because the Biden administration acted hastily when it issued its permits, something the company leading the project and state leaders said was untrue.

Orsted, the Danish developer of Revolution Wind, is suing the Trump administration over the work stoppage, calling it capricious and arbitrary. Separately, Connecticut and Rhode Island are also suing the administration to overturn the stop-work order.

Mr. Wright suggested, without citing evidence, that a damaged wind turbine blade from a different project, Vineyard Wind, that washed up on beaches of Nantucket last year occurred because those approvals were rushed. Mr. Wright blamed what he described as a misplaced emphasis in the Biden administration on tackling climate change and promoting clean energy.

“These were permitted rather quickly,” Mr. Wright said. “If you do something fast and quickly, because we’re in a crisis and it must happen, bad things happen.”

Vineyard Wind, in Massachusetts, applied for permits in 2017 and was approved in 2021.

Solar can cut power costs on the farm Solar energy is also boosting farm finances.
The changes also accelerate the phase‑out of wind power tax credits.
Renewable energy also powers rural economies Renewable energy benefits entire communities, not just individual farmers.
On the solar side, rural companies like APA Solar Racking, based in Ohio, manufacture steel racking systems for utility-scale solar farms across the Midwest.","Drive through the plains of Iowa or Kansas and you’ll see more than rows of corn, wheat and soybeans. You’ll also see towering wind turbines spinning above fields and solar panels shining in the sun on barns and machine sheds.

For many farmers, these are lifelines. Renewable energy provides steady income and affordable power, helping farms stay viable when crop prices fall or drought strikes.

But some of that opportunity is now at risk as the Trump administration cuts federal support for renewable energy.

Wind power brings steady income for farms

Wind energy is a significant economic driver in rural America. In Iowa, for example, over 60% of the state’s electricity came from wind energy in 2024, and the state is a hub for wind turbine manufacturing and maintenance jobs.

For landowners, wind turbines often mean stable lease payments. Those historically were around US$3,000 to $5,000 per turbine per year, with some modern agreements $5,000 to $10,000 annually, secured through 20- to 30-year contracts.

Nationwide, wind and solar projects contribute about $3.5 billion annually in combined lease payments and state and local taxes, more than a third of it going directly to rural landowners.

These figures are backed by long-term contracts and multibillion‑dollar annual contributions, reinforcing the economic value that turbines bring to rural landowners and communities.

Wind farms also contribute to local tax revenues that help fund rural schools, roads and emergency services. In counties across Texas, wind energy has become one of the most significant contributors to local property tax bases, stabilizing community budgets and helping pay for public services as agricultural commodity revenues fluctuate.

In Oldham County in northwest Texas, for example, clean energy projects provided 22% of total county revenues in 2021. In several other rural counties, wind farms rank among the top 10 property taxpayers, contributing between 38% and 69% of tax revenue.

The construction and operation of these projects also bring local jobs in trucking, concrete work and electrical services, boosting small-town businesses.

The U.S. wind industry supports over 300,000 U.S. jobs across construction, manufacturing, operations and other roles connected to the industry, according to the American Clean Power Association.

Renewable energy has been widely expected to continue to grow along with rising energy demand. In 2024, 93% of all new electricity generating capacity was wind, solar or energy storage, and the U.S. Energy Information Administration expected a similar percentage in 2025 as of June.

Solar can cut power costs on the farm

Solar energy is also boosting farm finances. Farmers use rooftop panels on barns and ground-mounted systems to power irrigation pumps, grain dryers and cold storage facilities, cutting their power costs.

Some farmers have adopted agrivoltaics – dual-use systems that grow crops beneath solar panels. The panels provide shade, helping conserve water, while creating a second income path. These projects often cultivate pollinator-friendly plants, vegetables such as lettuce and spinach, or even grasses for grazing sheep, making the land productive for both food and energy.

Federal grants and tax credits that were significantly expanded under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act helped make the upfront costs of solar installations affordable.

However, the federal spending bill signed by President Donald Trump on July 4, 2025, rolled back many clean energy incentives. It phases down tax credits for distributed solar projects, particularly those under 1 megawatt, which include many farm‑scale installations, and sunsets them entirely by 2028. It also eliminates bonus credits that previously supported rural and low‑income areas.

Without these credits, the upfront cost of solar power could be out of reach for some farmers, leaving them paying higher energy costs. At a 2024 conference organized by the Institute of Sustainability, Energy and Environment at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I work as a research economist, farmers emphasized the importance of tax credits and other economic incentives to offset the upfront cost of solar power systems.

What’s being lost

The cuts to federal incentives include terminating the Production Tax Credit for new projects placed in service after Dec. 31, 2027, unless construction begins by July 4, 2026, and is completed within a tight time frame. The tax credit pays eligible wind and solar facilities approximately 2.75 cents per kilowatt-hour over 10 years, effectively lowering the cost of renewable energy generation. Ending that tax credit will likely increase the cost of production, potentially leading to higher electricity prices for consumers and fewer new projects coming online.

The changes also accelerate the phase‑out of wind power tax credits. Projects must now begin construction by July 4, 2026, or be in service before the end of 2027 to qualify for any credit.

Meanwhile, the Investment Tax Credit, which covers 30% of installed cost for solar and other renewables, faces similar limits: Projects must begin by July 4, 2026, and be completed by the end of 2027 to claim the credits. The bill also cuts bonuses for domestic components and installations in rural or low‑income locations. These adjustments could slow new renewable energy development, particularly smaller projects that directly benefit rural communities.

While many existing clean energy agreements will remain in place for now, the rollback of federal incentives threatens future projects and could limit new income streams. It also affects manufacturing and jobs in those industries, which some rural communities rely on.

Renewable energy also powers rural economies

Renewable energy benefits entire communities, not just individual farmers.

Wind and solar projects contribute millions of dollars in tax revenue. For example, in Howard County, Iowa, wind turbines generated $2.7 million in property tax revenue in 2024, accounting for 14.5% of the county’s total budget and helping fund rural schools, public safety and road improvements.

In some rural counties, clean energy is the largest new source of economic activity, helping stabilize local economies otherwise reliant on agriculture’s unpredictable income streams. These projects also support rural manufacturing – such as Iowa turbine blade factories like TPI Composites, which just reopened its plant in Newton, and Siemens Gamesa in Fort Madison, which supply blades for GE and Siemens turbines. The tax benefits in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act helped boost those industries – and the jobs and local tax revenue they bring in.

On the solar side, rural companies like APA Solar Racking, based in Ohio, manufacture steel racking systems for utility-scale solar farms across the Midwest.

As rural America faces economic uncertainty and climate pressures, I believe homegrown renewable energy offers a practical path forward. Wind and solar aren’t just fueling the grid; they’re helping keep farms and rural towns alive.

Jen Kiggans, R-Va., highlighting provisions she says will deliver major benefits to Hampton Roads.

The Fiscal Year 2026 measure, passed on a 214–213 vote, funds the Army Corps of Engineers, the Department of Energy and water resource projects nationwide.

Republicans described the bill as strengthening U.S. energy dominance and military readiness. The legislation eliminates the Department of Energy’s Office of Energy Justice and Equity and the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, and cuts more than $1.6 billion from renewable energy accounts compared with last year.

The Senate must still act before the legislation becomes law.

Kiggans secured $5.4 million in community project funding for the Norfolk Harbor Operations and Maintenance project. That money will support annual dredging of the harbor and Elizabeth River, along with dike work at Craney Island to ensure safe navigation for commercial shipping, military vessels and fishing boats. She said the funding will help protect coastal communities from flooding and storm damage while keeping Navy ships mission-ready.

“Coastal Virginia is the backbone of America’s naval power, and keeping our harbors safe and our shoreline strong is critical to both our national defense and our local economy,” Kiggans said in a statement.

The bill also directs new Department of Energy funding to Jefferson Lab in Newport News, one of the nation’s top nuclear physics research facilities.

Projects there include construction of a high performance data facility and expansion of the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility. Kiggans said those investments will cement Hampton Roads’ role as a hub for scientific and technological innovation.

Nationally, the legislation sets aside $20.6 billion for nuclear weapons modernization, $2.17 billion for naval reactors including the Columbia-class submarine program, and nearly $2 billion for nuclear nonproliferation. It provides $9.8 billion for the Army Corps of Engineers, including almost $2 billion for flood and storm damage reduction projects across the country.

The measure boosts funding for advanced nuclear reactors and critical minerals research while reducing spending on renewable energy accounts.

It would also eliminate the Department of Energy’s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations and block federal support for diversity, equity and inclusion programs.

Kiggans added that the measure “is about strengthening national security, growing our economy, and making sure Coastal Virginia remains at the forefront of America’s future.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/32/23279358-da24-4fe1-bfae-0a01f105f350/67e1a96fbf4b2.image.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 22:02:29.720129

Rivian was just the latest automaker to announce layoffs or production cutbacks in light of recent changes to EV tax incentive programs and the overall automotive regulatory structure.

Electric-vehicle tax credits of $7,500 are now set to end Sept. 30 rather than extending through 2032, as originally planned.

In August, General Motors, which has recently made huge strides in its EV business, announced temporary layoffs for 360 workers at its Factory ZERO facility in Detroit, according to CBS News.

""Factory ZERO is making temporary adjustments to production to align to market dynamics,"" Kevin Kelly, a GM spokesperson, said at the time, per CBS News.

While the expiration of EV tax credits has gotten most of the attention, EV-only companies like Rivian, which do not make any gas-powered vehicles, have also faced other regulatory headwinds.

Specifically, automakers no longer face hefty fines for violating Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, Reuters reported in July.

""The decision is one of a number made by Washington to make it easier for automakers to build gasoline-powered vehicles and to make electric vehicle sales more costly,"" Reuters said at the time.

Under the CAFE program, automakers were required to make their fleets more fuel-efficient or face significant fines, which for some companies reached into the hundreds of millions of dollars, per Reuters.

In the alternative, noncomplying car companies were able to purchase credits from EV-only makers such as Tesla and Rivian to bring their vehicle lineups in line with CAFE standards.

Tesla had received $2.8 billion globally under such programs, per Reuters, while Rivian said in a court filing that the change in policy could cost the company $100 million, according to The Wall Street Journal.

With the $7,500 tax credit for EVs expiring Sept. 30, those who are thinking about upgrading to an electric vehicle should act quickly to take advantage — unless, of course, you're waiting for that R2 model from Rivian, which is set to begin mass production in 2026.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Rivian-layoffsimage-rec5fAZQPautqCPHu.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 22:01:43.752818

Increased precipitation and inland flooding threaten the structural integrity of thousands of bridges.
And the impacts of climate change for transportation infrastructure will only intensify over time,” Sherrill said.
Until then, the fight over how to balance resilience with affordability is set to dominate conversations from the Jersey Shore to riverfront towns.","New Jersey flood-zone rules spark storm of opposition from shore to river towns

Trenton, N.J. – Governor Phil Murphy has just a few months left in office, but he has a new idea for the Jersey Shore, and the Jersey Shore doesn’t like it any more than the governor’s failed windmill and school funding agendas.

This time, it A sweeping climate resilience plan from New Jersey regulators has triggered a surge of backlash across shore communities and inland towns alike, as residents and local leaders warn the proposed rules could drive up costs, stall development, and undercut already strained housing markets.

This means more homes will need to be raised to qualify for federal flood insurance and more restrictions will be placed on waterfront communities, many of which they cannot afford.

It’s not just Phil Murphy calling for a change. Mikie Sherrill, the Democrat nominee for governor this year is also on board with the sweeping proposed regulations.

“Here in New Jersey’s 11th District, we have been living with the impact of increased inland and coastal flooding due to climate change,” said Mikie Sherrill (D-NJ), Chairwoman of the Congressional Subcommittee on Environment. “Today’s report – based on robust scientific evidence from NOAA – tells us that that flooding from tidal and storm surges in the next 30 years will travel further inland and occur 10 times more often than it does today. We must redouble our efforts both to reduce climate warming pollution and to equip our communities with tools and resources to protect their residents from the worst effects of climate change.”

The regulations, known as the REAL rules—short for Resilient Environments and Landscapes—are part of the state’s Protecting Against Climate Threats (PACT) initiative. They would modernize land-use laws to account for projected sea-level rise and recurrent flooding, reshaping how development is planned from the coast to inland rivers.

At the center of the proposal is a new “Inundation Risk Zone,” covering areas projected to flood by 2100. In those zones, new construction and significant redevelopment would need to be elevated at least four feet above FEMA’s base flood standard, down from the original five-foot requirement after community pushback.

The rules would also expand flood hazard boundaries across the state and impose stricter stormwater and infrastructure mandates.

Business groups, municipalities, and homeowners argue the proposal could impose staggering costs without a clear economic analysis. Critics point to the state’s reliance on a severe sea-level scenario with only a 17% probability, which they say unfairly classifies vast areas as high risk.

Others warn of “dry access” requirements that could force property owners to elevate roads and infrastructure outside their control—effectively creating no-build zones.

“climate change poses an unprecedented threat to our transportation infrastructure. Sea level rise and coastal flooding place 60,000 miles of roads and bridges in coastal floodplains at greater risk. Rail infrastructure is vulnerable to more frequent extreme heat waves. Increased precipitation and inland flooding threaten the structural integrity of thousands of bridges. Airports are exposed to a spectrum of flooding and extreme heat risks. And the impacts of climate change for transportation infrastructure will only intensify over time,” Sherrill said.

The impact on housing and insurance looms large. Opponents fear the rules could depress property values, inflate flood insurance premiums, and stifle affordable housing development at a time when demand is already acute.

Supporters counter that the rules are grounded in science, citing Rutgers University research projecting up to five feet of sea-level rise by century’s end under moderate emissions scenarios. They argue that elevated standards are essential to safeguard communities against worsening storms and coastal flooding.

Don’t worry, adjustments and exemptions for affordable housing have already been built into the plan.

The Department of Environmental Protection has delayed final adoption, extending a 60-day comment period and additional hearings, with a final decision expected in early 2026. Until then, the fight over how to balance resilience with affordability is set to dominate conversations from the Jersey Shore to riverfront towns.

Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat running for governor has also issued a warning while serving in Congress about preparing New Jersey for her climate agenda and fears of rising sea levels.

“We’re no strangers to flooding in the Garden State. Storm after storm, New Jersey families and businesses have to face the devastating impact of major flood events. That’s why, since first taking office, I have been focused on working with the community to come up with both short and long-term solutions to build climate-resilient infrastructure that will protect our state from flooding. Each of the projects we fought for in this year’s WRDA will advance efforts to keep families safe from flooding and make long-overdue infrastructure upgrades,” said Rep. Sherrill.",https://www.shorenewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lifeguard-Stand-Ocean-City-NJ.-Sunrise-on-Ocean-City-N.-J.-s-beach.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 06:02:21.774102

Although a 50% price cut always seemed unrealistic, the president’s message sent a clear signal that lower energy costs were one of his top priorities. But in one key energy sector his administration is not showing much evidence that it is having any impact. US electricity prices, which began to rise steadily during the Biden administration, have continued to increase under President Trump.

Over the 12 years from the start of 2009 to the end of 2020, average US retail power prices, as measured by the electricity component in the CPI, rose by 12%. Over the four and a half years since the start of 2021, they have risen by 36%. The average annual rate of electricity price inflation has jumped from 1% to 7%.

Public concern over electricity bills is growing. A poll in April commissioned by the non-profit group PowerLines found that 63% of respondents said their electric and gas utility bills were adding to their financial stress. Social media are full of angry comments from consumers shocked by their rising bills.

Politicians have taken notice. Mikie Sherrill, the Democratic candidate for the governorship of New Jersey, has said that on her first day in office she would declare an emergency over utility costs.

Mike Braun, the Republican governor of Indiana, this week created a new role for a Utility Consumer Counselor, with a mission to save money for ratepayers. Governor Braun said: ""We can't take it anymore… [I would] like to see the utilities' investors bear more of the cost of doing business.""

Governor Ned Lamont of Connecticut, a Democrat, said in June: “I think electric bills are too damn high”, and signed legislation intended to cut them.

The American public has had a range of opinions on who bears the most responsibility for rising bills. A poll in New Jersey last month found that utility companies were the most widely blamed, chosen by 26% of respondents, followed by the state’s governor (19%), the federal government (15%), the state legislature (14%) and energy producers (10%).

Energy secretary Chris Wright said this week on Fox News that stopping the rise in electricity prices and reshoring jobs and opportunity was what he worried about most, seven days a week. And he argued that changing the direction of the industry would take time.

“Electricity prices rose a lot – almost 30% – under the Biden administration, and it angered Americans. It’s part of the reason President Trump was elected,” he said. “That is a key challenge for us, though: things move slowly in the electricity grid. All sorts of crazy projects were under construction and being built on your electricity grids over the last four years. We can’t stop all of them. They’re going to get finished. That extra expenditure goes into the rate base for the utility, and it pushes up your prices.”

Over the next few years, he added, he expected the administration to “make enormous progress” in stopping the rise in electricity prices, while making sure there was sufficient power available for the US to remain ahead of China in developing AI.

But progress over the next few years may not assuage mounting discontent among the American public.

The Wood Mackenzie view

The bad news for politicians and industry leaders who are being blamed for rising electricity bills is that the upward pressure on prices is set to continue. In fact, some of the drivers expected to push prices higher over the coming decades are only just starting to take effect.

Over the past five years, electricity bills have been rising in part because of the need to replace ageing infrastructure and strengthen resilience to events such as wildfires and storms.

Over the past four years, investment by US investor-owned electric utilities has risen by about 50%, from US$134 billion in 2021 to US$203 billion in 2025, according to the Edison Electric Institute, the industry group. That capital spending goes into the utilities’ rate bases, allowing them to recover their costs through higher bills.

Robert Whaley, Wood Mackenzie’s director for North America power, says there are two other key factors that will put upward pressure on US retail electricity prices over the years and decades to come.

One is demand growth, driven in particular by data centres for AI, but also by new manufacturing facilities and the electrification of transport in some states.

There are many uncertainties here, including how much of the proposed new demand will actually materialise, and how far rate structures are adopted to shield residential customers from some of the impact. But as a general principle, if higher demand means increased investment in new generation, distribution and transmission infrastructure, that investment will have to be paid for somehow.

The other factor is higher natural gas prices, driven by increased consumption for power generation and higher LNG exports. US benchmark Henry Hub gas has generally remained subdued in recent years, with prices falling back after a spike in 2022. But over time we think US gas prices will be on a rising trend.

Wood Mackenzie is forecasting that Henry Hub will average about US$4.60 per million British thermal units (mmBTU) in real terms in 2030, up from about US$3 / mmBTU today.

Because gas plants are generally the marginal suppliers, that will put wholesale power prices in most markets on a rising trend.

All this suggests that without some dramatic policy interventions, the consumers who are unhappy about their electricity bills are going to get even less happy in the years to come. The prospect of more such interventions is becoming a material issue for the industry.

In brief

President Trump has filed a formal request to the US Supreme Court for it to decide rapidly on the legality of the wide-ranging tariffs he has announced since taking office in January. Two lower courts have ruled that the president exceeded his legal powers when imposing two sets of tariffs: the “fentanyl tariffs” on imports from Mexico, Canada and China, and the “reciprocal tariffs” imposed on almost all countries.

Article I of the US Constitution specifies that it is Congress that has the power to “lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises… [and to] regulate Commerce with foreign Nations.” The Trump administration argues that the president is allowed to set tariffs under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which gives him the authority to take action “to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat” to the national security or economy of the US. John Sauer, the Trump administration’s solicitor-general, recommended that the Supreme Court should hear oral arguments in the case in the first week of November.

Two Japanese engineering companies have talked about confirmed or possible investments in power equipment manufacturing that should help ease tightness in the supply chain and allow a faster build-out of new infrastructure. Hitachi announced planned investments of more than US$1 billion in the US, including US$457 million for a new large power transformer factory in Virginia.

Separately, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries was reported to be prepared to double its production capacity for gas turbines. Chief executive Eisaku Ito said the company was already increasing capacity by 30%, but that would not be enough to meet growing demand.

The insurance marketplace Lloyd’s of London has said it will no longer seek to discourage insurers from providing coverage for coal, oil sands and Arctic oil projects. New chief executive Patrick Tiernan, who took over in June, told the Financial Times: “It’s important we don’t wade into issues we don’t need to.” Under his predecessor, John Neal, Lloyd’s had said in 2022 that it would ask insurers at the marketplace to no longer provide new insurance coverage for or invest in coal-fired power plants, thermal coal mines, oil sands projects and Arctic oil development. That position has now been dropped

Tiernan said in a statement discussing the financial performance of the Lloyd’s market in the first half of 2025: “We must remain apolitical. Our neutrality is part of our value. In a world of strained trade relations, Lloyd’s licence network can be a safe harbour.”

Quote of the week

“Even if you wrapped the entire planet in a solar panel, you would only be producing 20% of global energy. One of the biggest mistakes politicians can make is equating the ELECTRICITY with ENERGY!”

Chris Wright, the US energy secretary, posted on X in support of his argument that the Biden administration put too much emphasis on “unreliable, intermittent electricity” from wind and solar.

His point was that electricity accounts for only about 20% of the world’s final energy consumption. So even if all of that power was provided by solar, there would still be enormous demand for oil, gas and coal. Supporters of renewable energy countered that in that impossible hypothetical scenario – or even in a possible case of massively increased solar generation – electricity’s share of global energy consumption could increase significantly, through the electrification of transport and heating. It would also be possible to use electricity to create gas and liquid fuels.

Since 2021, the Clean Energy Workforce Roundtable has brought together hundreds of employers, educators, community-based organizations, labor leaders, and government partners to create an inclusive, coordinated clean energy workforce ecosystem across the 10-county region.

This work is part of our broader mission to position Southwestern Pennsylvania—Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, and beyond—as a national and global model for sustainable, equitable economic growth.

Why Pittsburgh and Why Now?

Findings from the Clean Energy Workforce Roundtable demonstrate that our region is positioned for a stronger, more resilient future. The 2024 report, Clean Energy Workforce Needs and Opportunities for Southwestern Pennsylvania, identifies priority sectors such as energy efficiency, electrification, construction, and advanced manufacturing that are poised for rapid growth with sustained regional support.

More importantly, these sectors represent accessible career paths for workers with a range of educational and professional backgrounds. However, opportunity alone is not enough. If we are going to lead in clean energy, we must act deliberately and collaboratively. Among the Roundtable’s top recommendations:

Build sector-based training partnerships among employers, education providers, workforce boards, and unions.

Embed equity and inclusion into every stage of the workforce pipeline.

Develop blended funding models across public, private, and philanthropic sectors to scale training, apprenticeships, and job placement efforts.

Support wraparound services like childcare, transit, and mentorship to remove persistent barriers to workforce entry.

These recommendations directly align with the insights of local stakeholders and broader regional research on clean energy development, including recent work by RMI.

Finding Regional Alignment

The Heinz Foundation, in conjunction with research firm RMI, has gathered data and released findings that support the need for regional alignment towards building a strong clean energy workforce ecosystem (detailed here: Developing Cleantech Clusters in Southwestern Pennsylvania).

The RMI report underscores the need for stronger regional coordination and shared infrastructure to support a thriving clean energy economy. Among its key recommendations is the establishment of a short-term, regional effort to explore how a cleantech cluster initiative could take shape, including identifying core functions, testing models, and eventually determining a permanent home for the effort.Five priority functions are identified for a cleantech cluster initiative:

Align stakeholders on a regional cleantech plan

Connect regional stakeholders across sectors

Conduct analysis to support location branding and competitive positioning

Coordinate the lab-to-market ecosystem to improve innovation flow

Augment business attraction, retention, and expansion efforts

These functions would require the collaborative involvement of diverse stakeholders including economic development organizations, universities, workforce developers, businesses, startup incubators, planning bodies, and community-based organizations to succeed.

These helpful insights reflect the very challenges Sustainable Pittsburgh’s Clean Energy Workforce Roundtable has been working to address since its inception. The Roundtable brings together essential partners focused on advancing solutions, and serves as a platform for collaboration that helps break down silos, share best practices, and elevate strategies that are inclusive, actionable, and grounded in the lived experiences of workers and communities.

The Road Ahead: Vision Meets Opportunity

The RMI report identifies three priority sectors where the region has a comparative advantage:

Battery Manufacturing and Recycling

Solar Component Manufacturing

Green Buildings and Related Technologies

These findings reinforce existing efforts of Sustainable Pittsburgh’s Clean Energy Workforce Roundtable, which has focused on building pathways into precisely these areas through regional coordination, workforce equity, and strategic visibility.

An integral project of the Roundtable’s work, the Future Energy Career Maps platform, was built to address the barriers identified in the RMI report: limited awareness of opportunities, fragmented training pathways, and unclear routes into emerging careers. The Career Maps (which currently highlight the construction and advanced manufacturing sectors) provide a clear, interactive pathway for job seekers to explore and pursue future potential in clean energy careers. The platform showcases real, achievable roles, local training providers, job requirements, expected salaries, and advancement opportunities.

The Future Energy Career Maps directly align with the talent pipelines needed in the three identified cleantech sectors:

Direct air capture isn’t just a carbon management solution, it’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to revitalize U.S. industry, restore communities, and secure America’s position in global energy markets. As DAC technology scales, it has the potential to create 130,000 American jobs in the coming decades — and reinvigorate regions hit hardest by the decline of manufacturing and industrial activity.

But the opportunity goes beyond jobs: DAC offers a rare chance to rebuild domestic supply chains, drive innovation and prosperity, and strengthen our national competitiveness in energy and infrastructure.

Manufacturing’s second act with DAC

U.S. supply chain realities are hitting multinational manufacturers hard. In the 1950s, manufacturing jobs represented 35% of U.S. employment; today, the share has dropped to just 9.4%. From solar panels to semiconductors, production capacity of critical components has increasingly moved overseas, jeopardizing U.S. economic security.

Meanwhile, global competitors like Canada, China, and the European Union are racing ahead with carbon removal technologies, bolstered by investment and policy support, putting them in a position to gain a first-mover advantage where American innovation can lead the way. Thanks to the preservation of the carbon capture and sequestration tax credit, or 45Q, in this year’s GOP budget legislation, the U.S. has taken an important step toward building a strong domestic DAC industry. Yet, without continued federal support to prioritize domestic manufacturing and deployment, we risk repeating a familiar story: developing transformative technology on U.S. soil, and scaling it abroad.

DAC presents a rare opportunity to break that cycle. It requires a complex supply chain — from steel and sensors to sorbents and automation — many of which can be produced by retooling or integrating into existing manufacturing processes. As automotive plants close around North America, many could be retooled to produce DAC systems, reviving local economies and extending the life of existing industrial assets. The technology can also be combined with existing ventilation systems in buildings, leveraging current infrastructure for low-cost carbon management, or else it can utilize waste heat to power the DAC regeneration process, improving overall energy efficiency.

One emerging use case is the data centers fueling the AI boom. Recent New York Times reporting showed that data centers are expected to double electricity use by 2030, intensifying pressure on regional grids and water supplies. As utilities scramble to keep up, some DAC systems offer a multi-faceted solution: They can integrate with data centers to recycle waste heat, reduce emissions, and even generate clean water.

With growing concern about data centers consuming entire towns’ worth of electricity and water, co-locating with DAC offers a way to decarbonize this next phase of digital infrastructure.

Community transformation: From coal to DAC

Consider Moffat County, Colorado, where Craig Station coal-fired power plant and nearby mines are closing. The community faces the loss of more than 400 jobs and nearly half of its property tax revenue when those facilities close their doors.

But rather than let these workers and towns fall behind, Colorado has introduced a carbon management roadmap, identifying DAC and other carbon management technologies as pillars of its energy future. The plan has the potential to create an average of 2,480 project jobs and 1,575 ongoing operation jobs across the state over 15 years — offering a future beyond coal.

This community shares a common need with many coal hubs across the U.S.: sustainable employment alternatives, leveraging existing skills and infrastructure to revitalize their economies. This is what DAC can provide.

Research indicates that an initial 500-kiloton DAC project generates between 540 and 1,370 average annual jobs over its five-year construction period, and between 300 and 420 ongoing jobs associated with maintaining the project and related supplier activities over the facility’s lifetime. Each DAC facility needs steel workers, engineers, technicians, operators, construction crews for building, maintenance teams for operation.

Critically, many of these roles are a fit for workers from fossil fuel and traditional energy sectors, which would make retraining easier and transitions smoother. At the same time, these regions can maintain their energy identity and leadership, continuing to be essential contributors to the country’s energy strategy.

The race to lead is on

The carbon removal market is expected to grow to as much as $100 billion a year by 2035. And with this massive opportunity comes intense competition. China and the EU are moving aggressively to make carbon removal a part of their industrial strategies. In fact, the EU is currently assessing DAC and other approaches to see how they can reach their goals. Canadian leaders announced they will ensure that the full value of their own carbon capture tax credit is extended to 2035 to support a broad range of carbon removal innovation.

The nation that leads in DAC will secure advantages that extend far beyond economic benefits. It will have the chance to shape global energy markets for decades to come, and shepherd critical supply chains. The United States has the expertise, industrial capacity, and skilled workforce to dominate this emerging sector — but only if we act decisively. To unlock this opportunity, we need to see coordinated efforts between industry, government, and communities, beginning now.

The most important piece in securing American leadership is having federal policies that prioritize domestic manufacturing, create long-term procurement pathways, and support early DAC deployment in energy communities. The strengthened 45Q tax credit is a powerful foundation — a clear signal that the current administration recognizes the opportunity. Now, Congress and the White House must build on that momentum to ensure that DAC becomes a “Made in America” industry that benefits the regions that need it most.

ENERGY AND WATER PROGRAMS: The House has passed the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act (H.R. 4553), sponsored by Rep. Chuck Fleischmann, R-Tenn., to provide $57 billion of fiscal 2026 funding for the Energy Department, the Bureau of Reclamation, and Army Corps of Engineers programs. Fleischmann said: “This legislation reflects a clear commitment to fiscal responsibility while safeguarding our national security and increasing economic prosperity for all of our citizens.” An opponent, Rep. Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, said the bill “does not meet our nation’s energy and water imperative for the future nor for the present. We must invest faster in modern infrastructure to become energy independent in perpetuity.” The vote, on Sept. 4, was 214 yeas to 213 nays.

He can’t help himself,” said Telemetry analyst Sam Abuelsamid who follows Tesla stock, which has plummeted 27% from its December high.
The plunge in Tesla sales this year was largely due to blowback over Musk’s affiliation with President Donald Trump.
Tesla sales have fallen precipitously in Europe after Musk aligned with a far-right political party in German.
The EV company is set to hold its annual shareholders meeting on Nov. 6, where investors will vote on the new pay package.","WASHINGTON — The world's richest man could become its first trillionaire if Elon Musk hits a series of extremely aggressive targets for his electric car company over the next decade, according to a proposed pay package released by the company.

Tesla said in a regulatory filing Friday that it will hand Musk shares worth as much as 12% of the company in a dozen separate packages if the company meets certain performance targets, including massive increases in car production, share price and operating profit. If approved by shareholders, the new pay package could make Musk the world’s first trillion dollar executive, and would mark a new level of outsized pay in a country already known for extreme compensation. But the payoff is in shares, not cash, and the goals are extreme as well.

Musk overcame doubters to turn Tesla into the world's most valuable car company, but he could face even steeper odds in hitting the targets set by the company's compensation committee — not least because of Tesla’s main business of making electric vehicles is currently in a slump, in part because of Musk's foray into right-wing politics.

“It doesn’t matter how much money he gets. He can’t help himself,” said Telemetry analyst Sam Abuelsamid who follows Tesla stock, which has plummeted 27% from its December high. “And the more he talks, the more he turns off potential customers.”

To get his first package of shares equivalent to 1% of the company, Musk would have to convince investors in the stock market that Tesla is worth $2 trillion in total, double what they value it today, and also hit several other milestones. To receive all the shares offered and make him the world’s first trillion-dollar man would require that market value to then rise to $8.5 trillion, double that of the world’s most valuable company now, chipmaker Nvidia.

Among other goals, sales of all Tesla vehicles would eventually also have to reach 20 million, nearly triple its entire sales since it was founded more than two decades ago. Musk would also have to vastly expand Tesla's robot and robotaxi businesses by selling a million of the bots and a million of the driverless cabs, the latter a business that has only begun to roll out its taxi service and is behind rivals, such as Waymo.

Musk would also need to remain with Tesla for at least seven and a half years to cash out on any stock, and 10 years to earn the full amount.

Musk has been one of the richest people in the world for several years. He is currently estimated to be worth more than $400 billion by Forbes magazine.

A condition of the 11th and 12th tranches of the plan includes Musk coming up with a framework for someone to succeed him as CEO.

The plunge in Tesla sales this year was largely due to blowback over Musk’s affiliation with President Donald Trump. Tesla also faces intensifying competition from the big Detroit automakers and particularly from China.

Tesla sales have fallen precipitously in Europe after Musk aligned with a far-right political party in German. Sales plunged 40% in July in the 27 European Union countries compared with the year earlier even as sales overall of electric vehicle soared, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association. Meanwhile sales of Chinese rival BYD continued to climb fast, grabbing 1.1% market share of all car sales in the month versus Tesla’s 0.7%.

Without a reversal of those trends, meeting the financial goals could prove especially difficult. In its most recent quarter, Tesla reported that quarterly profits plunged from $1.39 billion to $409 million. Revenue also fell and the company came up short of even the lowered expectations on Wall Street.

Investors have grown increasingly worried about the trajectory of the company after Musk had spent so much time in Washington this year, becoming one of the most prominent officials in the Trump administration in its bid to slash the size of the U.S. government.

Even bulls on the stock are not convinced the new pay incentive will keep Musk, who frequently posts on his X social media platform, from saying things that alienate potential buyers.

Said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, “Fixing the Musk brand damage remains a work in progress."" Even so, Ives told clients, “We believe this was the smart move by the Board as the biggest asset for Tesla is Musk.”

In January 2024, a Delaware judge threw out Musk’s previous pay package, worth $44.9 billion at the time. Investors voted to restore that compensation package at Tesla’s last shareholders meeting on June 13 of last year. But late last year the package was revoked for a second time. Tesla has appealed the ruling. Last month, Tesla said that it gave Musk a stock grant of $29 billion as a reward for years of “transformative and unprecedented” growth — despite the drop in sales and profits — and noting that the CEO hadn’t been paid in years.

The EV company is set to hold its annual shareholders meeting on Nov. 6, where investors will vote on the new pay package. Musk would also receive more voting power over Tesla under the proposed plan. Musk has said that he needed more shares and control so he couldn’t be ousted by shareholder activists. If he does hit all the goals, Musk would own about quarter of the company’s shares, up from 13% today.

In conclusion, the Russian-China energy shift creates a strategic window for U.S. investors to bolster energy security and capitalize on emerging markets.","The global liquefied natural gas (LNG) market in 2025 is undergoing a seismic shift as Russia pivots its energy exports toward China, reshaping trade flows and challenging U.S. energy dominance. This realignment, driven by geopolitical tensions and strategic infrastructure projects like the Power of Siberia 2 pipeline, presents both risks and opportunities for investors in U.S. energy infrastructure and alternative technologies.

The Russian-China Energy Partnership: A Geopolitical and Market Shift

Russian pipeline gas exports to China surged by 25% in the first half of 2025, with the Power of Siberia pipeline operating at maximum capacity [5]. Meanwhile, Russian LNG exports to China, though declining by 18.8% year-on-year to 3.38 million tons in Q3 2025 [2], remain a critical component of China’s energy mix, accounting for 21% of Russia’s LNG exports in early 2025 [6]. This shift reflects a deliberate strategy by Russia to diversify its export markets amid Western sanctions and China’s desire to secure long-term energy supplies.

The Power of Siberia 2 pipeline, finalized in September 2025, exemplifies this partnership. Expected to deliver 50 billion cubic meters of gas annually to China via Mongolia, the project underscores Russia’s pivot to Asia and China’s growing leverage in global gas markets [3]. However, the pipeline’s economic viability remains uncertain due to pricing disputes and financing challenges [4].

Implications for U.S. LNG Exports and Energy Security

While Russian gas sales to China have not directly harmed U.S. energy markets, as noted by the U.S. Energy Secretary in September 2025 [1], the long-term implications are significant. China’s increasing reliance on Russian pipeline gas—particularly through the Power of Siberia 1 pipeline, which operates near its 3.7 billion cubic feet per day capacity [4]—reduces its dependence on LNG, including U.S. exports. This shift is compounded by geopolitical tensions, such as U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, which have led to re-sales of U.S.-sourced LNG cargoes in China [6].

Yet, the U.S. LNG industry is not without momentum. New projects like the Plaquemines LNG facility and Corpus Christi Stage 3 expansion have boosted U.S. peak export capacity to over 17 billion cubic feet per day in 2025 [2]. By 2030, U.S. LNG capacity is projected to grow by 75%, driven by final investment decisions on projects like Louisiana LNG Phase 1 and CP2 LNG Phase 1 [1]. This expansion positions the U.S. to capitalize on global LNG demand, particularly in Asia, where Russia’s market share may plateau due to infrastructure constraints [5].

Strategic Investment Opportunities in U.S. Energy Infrastructure

The U.S. energy infrastructure sector offers compelling opportunities for investors seeking to hedge against geopolitical risks. The Trump administration’s focus on accelerating LNG exports and removing regulatory barriers aligns with the need to counter Russian-China energy partnerships [3]. For instance, Woodside Energy’s Louisiana LNG Phase 1 and Cheniere’s Corpus Christi Midscale Trains 8 & 9 are expected to come online between 2027 and 2029, further solidifying U.S. export capacity [1].

Investors should also consider the role of Canadian LNG projects, such as LNG Canada, which began operations in June 2025 [1]. These projects diversify North American supply chains and reduce reliance on Russian energy, aligning with U.S. strategic interests.

The Rise of Alternative Energy: A Counterbalance to Fossil Fuel Dynamics

While LNG remains a cornerstone of global energy security, the rapid growth of renewable energy investments in China and the U.S. is reshaping the landscape. China’s clean energy investment in 2024 exceeded $625 billion, with solar and wind capacity targets achieved six years ahead of schedule [4]. In contrast, U.S. investments in renewable energy declined by 36% in the first half of 2025 due to policy uncertainty [1].

However, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 has catalyzed $115 billion in U.S. clean energy manufacturing investments through Q1 2025 [3]. This momentum, though lagging behind China’s pace, highlights opportunities in technologies like hydrogen, carbon capture, and next-generation nuclear energy [3]. Investors who prioritize these sectors can capitalize on the U.S.’s ""all-of-the-above"" energy strategy while mitigating exposure to volatile fossil fuel markets.

Geopolitical Risks and the Path Forward

The U.S. and its allies must remain vigilant against Russian sanctions evasion and the EU’s phasedown of Russian gas imports [1]. Meanwhile, China’s domestic renewable energy growth—driven by solar PV, intelligent grids, and battery storage—could further reduce its LNG demand [6]. For investors, this underscores the importance of diversifying portfolios across energy infrastructure and alternative technologies.

In conclusion, the Russian-China energy shift creates a strategic window for U.S. investors to bolster energy security and capitalize on emerging markets. By leveraging U.S. LNG expansion, supporting domestic clean energy innovation, and navigating geopolitical risks, investors can position themselves at the forefront of a transformed global energy landscape.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-05 23:58:44.588722

“Fuel is the most important factor in bringing advanced nuclear energy to market,” said Jacob DeWitte, Oklo co-founder and CEO.
“Tennessee is well positioned to lead America’s energy independence, which is why we created the Nuclear Energy Fund to support and expand our state’s nuclear ecosystem.
Oklo is developing next-generation nuclear power plants called “powerhouses” that run on nuclear waste.
Oklo argues its business model simplifies clean energy access by selling power, not power plants – offering customers a direct pathway to advanced nuclear energy.","Advanced nuclear power and fuel company Oklo announced plans to design, build and operate a fuel recycling facility in Tennessee as the first phase of an advanced fuel center through investment totaling up to $1.68 billion.

The initial investment will be for the construction of a facility to recycle used nuclear fuel into fuel for fast reactors like Oklo’s Aurora powerhouse, and the company claims it will be the first of its kind in the U.S.

Oklo is also exploring opportunities with the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to recycle the utility’s used fuel at the new facility and to evaluate potential power sales from future Oklo powerhouses in the region to TVA. This collaboration would mark the first time a U.S. utility has explored recycling its used fuel into clean electricity using modern electrochemical processes, Oklo noted.

“Fuel is the most important factor in bringing advanced nuclear energy to market,” said Jacob DeWitte, Oklo co-founder and CEO. “By recycling used fuel at scale, we are turning waste into gigawatts, reducing costs, and establishing a secure U.S. supply chain that will support the deployment of clean, reliable, and affordable power. Tennessee is showing the nation that recycling can be done to support new nuclear development and growth.”

Oklo has completed a licensing project plan for the fuel recycling facility with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and is currently in pre-application engagement with the regulator’s staff. In July, Oklo successfully completed pre-application readiness assessment for Phase 1 of the combined license application for Oklo’s first commercial Aurora powerhouse. The facility in Tennessee is expected to begin producing metal fuel for Aurora powerhouses by the early 2030s, following regulatory review and approvals.

Oklo argues that the more than 94,000 metric tons of used nuclear fuel stored at power plant sites around the country contain “considerable reserves” of recyclable fuel, with the energy available from this material via recycling equivalent to about 1.3 trillion barrels of oil, or five times the reserves of Saudi Arabia.

“The next generation of nuclear technologies are being built and developed right here in our own backyard,” said TVA President and CEO Don Moul. “Our partnership with Oklo represents yet another step forward in shaping the future of nuclear energy and ensuring a secure energy future for the Valley and beyond.”

The fuel recycling facility is the first phase of Oklo’s broader advanced fuel center, a multi-facility campus aimed at supporting recycling and fuel fabrication.

“Tennessee is well positioned to lead America’s energy independence, which is why we created the Nuclear Energy Fund to support and expand our state’s nuclear ecosystem. We’re proud to partner with Oklo to innovate for the future, while bringing continued opportunity and prosperity to Tennessee families,” said Governor Bill Lee.

Oklo is developing next-generation nuclear power plants called “powerhouses” that run on nuclear waste. The company’s Aurora powerhouse design is a fast neutron reactor that would transport heat from the reactor core to a power conversion system and is designed to run on material from used nuclear fuel known as HALEU, or “high assay, low-enriched uranium.” The reactor builds on the Experimental Breeder Reactor-II and space reactor legacy. The Aurora powerhouse is designed to scale to 15 MW and 50 MW offerings today. Oklo is also evaluating a 100 MW or larger offering that it is developing.

Oklo argues its business model simplifies clean energy access by selling power, not power plants – offering customers a direct pathway to advanced nuclear energy. Aurora powerhouses are planned to support growing energy demands as they are deployed in the future. Oklo’s first Aurora powerhouse is targeted for deployment in 2027 at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL).",https://www.power-eng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-2-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 22:59:20.412250

By constructing a network of deep underground tunnels, National Grid aims to address the city’s increasing energy needs, ensuring a secure and sustainable power supply for years to come. A central component of this ambitious initiative is the Bengeworth Road substation, a 400kV high-voltage facility designed to provide reliable power to homes and businesses across Central and South London. This substation plays a critical role in stabilizing network voltage and enhancing the capacity to connect future renewable energy sources to the grid.

National Grid has set a bold target to reduce emissions of SF6 from its network by 50% by 2030, marking a major milestone in its drive toward sustainability. Achieving this vision required more than just replacing legacy equipment; it demanded a new generation of high-performance, eco-efficient technologies.

At the Bengeworth Road substation, the journey began with the deployment of ester-filled transformers and SF₆-free switchgear. Hitachi Energy delivered seven bays of its EconiQ™ 420 kV gas-insulated switchgear (GIS) and 420 kV gas-insulated lines (GIL), enabling long-distance electricity transmission without the use of SF₆.

But innovation didn’t stop there. National Grid sought a direct connection between the eco-efficient transformers and SF₆-free switchgear - a configuration never implemented before. This requirement called for a complete redesign of the transformer bushing, a critical component that enables the safe and reliable transfer of electricity between the transformer and switchgear.

To meet this challenge, Hitachi Energy developed a new bushing design with updated coating and gasket systems, engineered specifically for compatibility with both ester oil and the alternative insulating gas. This advancement ensured not only technical performance and safety but also compliance with strict environmental standards.

To solve this challenge, Hitachi Energy introduced a breakthrough component: GARIP Eco, a next-generation dry-type resin-impregnated paper (RIP) bushing developed specifically for SF₆-free applications. For the Bengeworth project, Hitachi Energy delivered 420 kV and 145 kV GARIP Eco bushings designed to operate reliably between ester-filled transformers and EconiQ™ SF₆-free GIS.

GARIP Eco is a next-generation solution purpose-built for tomorrow’s switchgear. Developed in response to the industry’s growing shift toward eco-efficient gas mixtures like C4-FN blends, GARIP Eco bridges the insulation and mechanical challenges posed by new dielectric conditions, elevated internal pressures, and material compatibility with ester oils.

Developed through close collaboration across transformer and switchgear engineering teams, GARIP Eco represents a complete rethinking of bushing performance, engineered from the ground up to handle the new insulation gases, materials, and pressure demands of a fully eco-efficient system.

Its dry-type design also eliminates the risks associated with oil-filled components, enhancing environmental safety and simplifying maintenance. In doing so, GARIP Eco has proven its role not only as a technical enabler but as a foundational element for future-ready substation design.

This pilot project has successfully validated the seamless interaction between the innovative GARIP Eco bushings and EconiQ™ switchgear, making them ready for deployment in future applications.

Additionally, the extensive research and expertise gained during this project provide a strong foundation for verifying compatibility with other gases upon request.

A key advantage of Hitachi Energy's bushings is also their universal platform applicability to transformers from all OEMs, offering unmatched flexibility and scalability for future projects.

The implementation of Hitachi Energy’s GARIP Eco bushings has delivered transformative benefits, ensured the compatibility of SF6-free systems while enabling a more compact and eco-efficient substation design. By eliminating the need for larger infrastructure, this solution significantly reduces material use and lowers the substation's overall carbon emissions.

The Bengeworth Road substation is set to play a vital role in providing a reliable power supply for London, supporting the integration of more renewable energy sources into the grid, and advancing the UK’s net-zero ambitions. Beyond energy innovation, National Grid’s commitment to sustainability was further demonstrated by planting 27 new trees in Ruskin Park, achieving a 10% net biodiversity gain in the substation area.

In conclusion, the collaboration between Hitachi Energy and National Grid has not only overcome the challenges of transitioning to SF6-free systems but has also set a new benchmark for sustainable energy solutions. By empowering National Grid to meet its sustainability goals, Hitachi Energy has contributed to the creation of a eco-friendly and resilient energy grid for London and beyond, setting a new benchmark for innovation and partnership in building a more resilient, low-carbon energy future.",https://dynamic-assets.hitachienergy.com/is/image/hitachiabbpowergrids/css-bengeworth-page-banner-image-2880x1125px:16-9?wid=1440&hei=810&fmt=png-alpha&fit=crop%2C1,N,,2025-09-06 06:59:46.457716

“We have an auto sector that because of the massive change in U.S. trade policy is under exteme pressure.
Carney also announced measures for workers and businesses in those sectors most impacted by the U.S. tariffs and trade disruptions.
Volpe said Canadians buy about 2 million vehicles a year and make just under 2 million.
Carney said the government is also launching a new $370 million Canadian (US$268 million) production incentive to help Canada’s canola producers.","TORONTO (AP) — Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is delaying a requirement for automakers to begin hitting minimum sales levels for electric vehicles next year as the sector deals with U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs.

Former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau set the target, requiring that in 2026 20% of passenger vehicles sold should be zero-emission vehicles.

Removing the requirement comes as automakers absorb Trump's tariffs.

“We have an auto sector that because of the massive change in U.S. trade policy is under exteme pressure. We recognize that,"" Carney said.

“The EV mandate adds to the liquidity issues they have, the financial challenges these producers have. They've got enough on their plate right now so we are taking that off.”

The Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers' Association and others have been lobbying the government to scrap the EV mandate.

Flavio Volpe, Automotive Parts Manufacturers Associated president, noted the U.S. has ended EV incentives and industrial support and is going back to “pickup trucks and dinosaurs.”

Volpe said auto factories in Canada are geared to push product to the U.S., and Canada doesn't have much choice in the short term.

“I’m glad that we punted,"" Volpe said. “The White House has turned on the industry.""

Carney also announced measures for workers and businesses in those sectors most impacted by the U.S. tariffs and trade disruptions. The government is also making employment insurance more flexible and with extended benefits.

“We can't rely on our most important trading partner like we once did,” Carney said.

Most imports from Canada and Mexico are still protected by the United States-Mexico-Canada trade pact, but Trump has some sector-specific tariffs that do apply for Canada despite the USMCA — known as 232 tariffs — which are having an impact on the Canadian economy and the auto sector in particular. There is the 50% tariff on steel and aluminum imports, for example.

The Big 3 American automakers, General Motors, Ford and Jeep-maker Stellantis, who all build in Canada, face the 50% tariff on steel and aluminum and a 25% tariff on parts and finished vehicles, with some exceptions for products covered under the USMCA.

Autos are Canada’s second-largest export and the sector employs 125,000 Canadians directly and almost another 500,000 in related industries. Volpe said Canadians buy about 2 million vehicles a year and make just under 2 million.

Carney said the government is also launching a new $370 million Canadian (US$268 million) production incentive to help Canada’s canola producers. China hit Canadian canola with a 75.8% tariff last month, a measure widely seen as a response to Canada’s 100% tariff on Chinese electric vehicles.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/5jFAqvLzWvjJd5k3tZd.BA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/d7466ba6ed681536d57d11a902ae37d8,N,,2025-09-06 01:00:08.306202

""It's an innovative and very beneficial way to use land for both renewable energy, clean energy production, but also for agricultural purposes.""
For Clean Energy: Solar panels continue producing renewable energy while the land below serves agricultural purposes, maximizing land use efficiency.","WACO, Texas — An unexpected sound fills the air between rows of gleaming solar panels on a sprawling Central Texas energy farm: the gentle buzzing of thousands of bees.

It's an innovative partnership helping veterans and first responders heal from trauma while supporting renewable energy and environmental conservation.

The collaboration between renewable energy company Enel North America and Hives for Heroes — a national organization that uses beekeeping as therapy for veterans and first responders — represents a groundbreaking approach to both clean energy production and mental health treatment.

Steve Jimenez, a former Marine and founder of Hives for Heroes, knows firsthand the struggles veterans face when transitioning back to civilian life. His organization has become the world's largest beekeeping organization, serving over 10,000 veterans and first responders daily across the United States.

""When you overcome that fear and you get into a hive, the whole world disappears,"" Jimenez explained. ""For a vet, that might be the trauma of losing somebody. That might be the trauma of taking life. You're just removing yourself a little bit from that, focusing on something else.""

The therapeutic benefits of beekeeping go beyond psychological healing. The hands-on work requires focus and presence, helping participants break cycles of anxiety and depression.

""We talk about suiting up, trusting yourself, your gear, and your buddies, following a known process, finding success and building confidence,"" Jimenez said. ""And we believe that you can do that in any aspect of your life.""

The partnership with Enel North America began in 2024 when the renewable energy company sought innovative ways to use land between solar panels more effectively. Enel had already been committed to supporting pollinator habitat creation since 2016, making beehives a natural fit.

Jesse Puckett, Director of Sustainability Projects for Enel North America and a current member of the Oklahoma Army National Guard, saw the alignment immediately.

""In this industry, we call it agrivoltaics or dual-use solar,"" Puckett explained. ""It's an innovative and very beneficial way to use land for both renewable energy, clean energy production, but also for agricultural purposes.""

The program now operates at two sites — one near Waco and another close to Bryan-College Station. The results have exceeded expectations for both organizations.

The partnership creates multiple benefits:

For Veterans and First Responders: Therapeutic beekeeping provides mental health benefits, job training, potential revenue streams, and most importantly, a renewed sense of purpose and community.

For the Environment: Bees pollinate native plants, creating biodiversity and supporting local ecosystems. The partnership has led to thriving habitats for birds, butterflies, and other wildlife.

For Clean Energy: Solar panels continue producing renewable energy while the land below serves agricultural purposes, maximizing land use efficiency.

For Local Communities: The program supports local food systems through honey production and creates economic opportunities for participants.

One of the most appealing aspects of Hives for Heroes is that no prior experience is necessary. The organization provides comprehensive training and all necessary equipment free to participants.

""You join at hivesforheroes.org,"" Jimenez said. ""You basically go from zero to hero or hero to hero in a very short period of time through all the tools, the resources, but most importantly finding that connection, finding that purpose again.""

The training covers everything from bee biology and hive management to safety protocols and honey harvesting. Participants also learn business skills that can help them turn beekeeping into a source of income.

Both organizations have ambitious plans for expansion. As Enel grows its solar operations and more veterans sign up for the program, the model could be replicated nationwide and potentially globally.

""Enel has a large reach globally,"" Jimenez noted. ""Figuring out the processes and successes for us are incredibly important because then we can scale this with anybody that's in those environments.""

Puckett echoed the enthusiasm for growth: ""My goal, and my hope is that we continue to expand and as more people go to hivesforheroes.org and they sign up and they want to be a part of this, hopefully they're coming to our site to be able to provide that land access for them.""

For Jimenez and the thousands of veterans and first responders involved in the program, Hives for Heroes represents something deeper than just learning a new skill or hobby.

""You can't take Marines out of the Marine Corps,"" Jimenez reflected. ""You can't take the service level out. We're always going to be serving our brothers and sisters in one way or another, and I'm glad we get to do it together.""",https://media.kcentv.com/assets/KCEN/images/e64c2464-c028-4f1a-9beb-f24275f0032d/20250905T220639/e64c2464-c028-4f1a-9beb-f24275f0032d_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 20:04:10.387815

Cox Automotive analysts expect Q3 to surpass the previous record of 356,000 EV sales in Q4 2024, then to decline.","EV sales are barreling toward a record finish in Q3—but the rest of the year looks murky for battery-powered vehicles.

That’s because consumers are racing to take advantage of lucrative deals on electric models that are only available until the Sept. 30 expiration of federal EV tax credits that offer buyers up to $7,500 in incentives.

“Despite initial concerns that EV inventory could be a bottleneck, inventory is now more likely an albatross,” Tyson Jominy, SVP of data and analytics at JD Power, said in a statement.

“There are 197,000 EV units on the ground, down just 10,000 from July, and a robust 59-day supply,” he added. “Yet, like Cinderella’s magic, this brilliance faces a deadline—when the clock strikes midnight on Oct. 1, the $7,500 federal support vanishes, threatening to turn this inventory into costly pumpkins for automakers and dealers.”

Records galore: General Motors reported that its US EV sales “likely set an all-time monthly record in August, as customers rushed to make purchases ahead of” the tax credits’ expiration. The Detroit automaker (which doesn’t report sales totals on a monthly basis and will share Q3 numbers in October) sold more than 21,000 EVs across its Cadillac, Chevy, and GMC brands.

“We’re expecting strong demand once again in September,” Duncan Aldred, SVP and president of North America for GM, said in a blog post. “The question, of course, is what’s next? There’s no doubt we’ll see lower EV sales next quarter after tax credits end September 30, and it may take several months for the market to normalize.”

“We will almost certainly see a smaller EV market for a while, and we won’t overproduce,” he added. “Still, we believe GM can continue to grow market share.”

On that note: GM is cutting production at its EV plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee, in December, and delaying a second shift to produce the electric Chevy Bolt at a plant near Kansas City, Reuters reported Thursday.

Meanwhile, Kia reported record monthly sales, up more than 10% YoY, boosted in part by record-setting sales of the electric EV9. Sister brand Hyundai also had an all-time best August performance, with sales up 12% YoY and EV sales up 72% YoY.

American Honda reported its best-ever electrified vehicle sales in August, and noted that record monthly sales of the all-electric Prologue came “as buyers rush to complete sales ahead of the [Inflation Reduction Act] incentive expiration.” Ford’s EV sales grew 19.3% YoY and hybrids jumped 14.5%.

Looking ahead: The federal incentives, which include a $7,500 tax credit on certain new EV models and a $4,000 credit on eligible used EVs, are going away under President Donald Trump’s tax and budget bill.

Analysts at JD Power predicted that the end of the tax credits would help lift new-vehicle sales more than 8% YoY in August. They also projected an all-time high EV market share of 12%, up from 9.5% a year ago.

On average, automakers were offering incentives of $6,700 per unit on EVs, $1,500 more than in July, sending average prices of EVs down $2,500 to $44,300—lower than the average price of $45,700 for ICE vehicles, per JD Power.

Cox Automotive analysts expect Q3 to surpass the previous record of 356,000 EV sales in Q4 2024, then to decline.

“Sales of EVs will likely fall dramatically when tax credits expire,” Charlie Chesbrough, senior economist at Cox, said in a statement, “and market conditions for other vehicles will become more challenging in future months.”","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/83de453fe4c06fdaad8a6eee05f2b87e956936f1-7952x5304.jpg?rect=0,564,7952,4175&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2025-09-05 21:00:33.327325

It doesn’t happen often, but sometimes Republicans and Democrats agree.

And when it comes to America’s permitting system, both sides of the aisle know it’s broken.

That consensus matters because the problem urgently needs to be fixed.

Approvals for critical projects that should take weeks or months routinely drag on for years, mired in red tape and lawsuits.

As President Biden’s senior advisor, John Podesta, said in 2023, “We got so good at stopping projects, we forgot how to build things in America.”

THE COST OF DELAY

This broken system has real-world consequences.

Rising energy costs are squeezing American families and businesses — showing up in higher utility bills, pricier commutes, and the cost of everyday goods across the economy.

Affordable energy powered America’s rise in the 20th century, fueling innovation and economic growth. But today, outdated rules put us at risk of falling behind.

Electricity doesn’t simply appear in our homes and businesses. It requires a vast and complex generation, transmission, and distribution supply chain that often needs upgrades to keep up with ever-growing demand.

And demand is soaring. Electric vehicles, data centers, and the AI revolution are pushing America’s power grid to its limits.

AI alone requires massive amounts of reliable power for data centers and high-performance computing. Our outdated permitting system simply won’t allow us to keep up with the demand, which threatens our ability to lead on this critical new technology.

At the same time, reliable coal and fossil fuel plants that provide steady baseload power are being retired faster than replacements can come online.

Without reform, the infrastructure needed to expand grid capacity and bring new generation to market will remain unbuilt, leaving the country less secure, less competitive, and without reliable power.

THE WAY FORWARD

Permitting reform is the key to clearing the way for energy projects and unlocking lower costs, more jobs, and stronger communities.

While lawmakers have long recognized that unnecessary self-imposed federal regulations are holding back America’s energy potential, they never anticipated how quickly technology and innovation would make solving this problem mission critical for our economy and global competitiveness.

That’s why momentum is finally building across party lines to get it done.

Permitting reform is an opportunity for Republicans and Democrats to work together to deliver a rare, bipartisan win for the American people. Outdated rules are blocking progress on building pipelines, renewable energy facilities, nuclear plants, transmission lines, and storage projects.

The question is no longer whether the system is broken. It’s whether Washington will finally rise to the occasion and fix it.

SECURING THE FUTURE

Majority Leader Steve Scalise is betting that it can.

He has made permitting reform a top priority this fall, putting real weight behind the effort to modernize America’s energy policies and clear the way for projects that can power the future.

Energy is the foundation of America’s prosperity and security.

As Leader Scalise put it, “American energy provides us national security and really leads us to global leadership that the whole world wants to see. … We know the ability America has to unleash American energy if we just get red tape out of the way.”

He’s right. If Washington clears the way, America can unleash its energy potential and lead the world.

Permitting reform is no longer optional. It’s essential.

Families need relief from high energy costs, businesses need reliable power, and America needs the capacity to compete and lead.

For once, there is bipartisan agreement on the problem and the need for a solution.

That rare consensus gives Congress the chance to rise above politics and deliver a win that matters: affordable, reliable American energy that fuels growth, strengthens communities, and secures our future.

But it won’t happen without your help. Lawmakers need to hear that families, businesses, and communities are demanding relief. The time to act is now.",https://americansforprosperity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-57.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 22:59:24.154706

It's a different segment to the TT - it's somewhere exactly in the middle between TT and R8,"" he told Autocar.
""The car that you see here is a preview of a production car - almost literally,"" he said, confirming 2027 as an expected launch date.
He added that the production car will remain electric-only, and there are no plans for a combustion version: ""We believe the electric drivetrain is a perfect fit.
""In 1998, when the first Audi TT arrived at a dealership in Turin, I took a day off work to just look at the car in peace,"" he said.","Audi has revealed a striking two-seat sports car inspired by the TT, which previews a radical new design language for all of its upcoming cars - and will go on sale largely unaltered in 2027.

The Concept C was revealed at a dedicated event in Milan – a week before making its public debut at Audi’s local motor show in Munich – as the first step in a complete design and strategy rethink for the company, via which it aims to return to growth following a challenging period of declining sales and weakened profit margins.

Its unveiling comes around two years after Audi ended production of the TT, the era-defining, Volkswagen Golf-based sports coupé that enjoyed strong commercial success over three generations.

The retirement of the V10-engined R8 supercar a few months later left the German firm without a dedicated sports car offering for the first time in a quarter of a century.

But this new show car is confirmation that the firm will make a grand return to the segment with a compact, electric two-seater that blends futuristic cues and technology with elements of historic Audi models and a focus on driver engagement.

While the Concept C takes heavy inspiration from Audi's seminal sports coupé, though, CEO Gernot Döllner categorically ruled out applying the TT name to the production version given the inherent differences in positioning.

""The Concept C is not a successor of the TT. It's a different segment to the TT - it's somewhere exactly in the middle between TT and R8,"" he told Autocar. ""We will come up with a name once the car hits the road as a serious product.""

Simplicity is key

The Concept C – a name that references both Audi's renewed focus on 'clarity' and the 1936 Auto Union Type C grand prix racer from which it takes inspiration – is a statement of intent from new head of design Massimo Frascella, who aims to make the brand ""truly distinctive again"" with his radical new styling direction.

Frascella joined Audi last year after a 13-year stint at JLR, where he led the design of the current Discovery, Defender and Range Rover. On his arrival in Ingolstadt, he spoke of his appreciation of ""simplicity"" and said he was “passionate about creating designs that are free from superfluous ornaments and do not merely follow trends”.

The Concept C stays true to that ambition, with a minimalist, monolithic design treatment that majors on simplicity - a theme which will come to define not just the company's cars but also its strategic approach as it embarks on a ""fundamental realignment"" underpinned by a focus ""on what is essential"".

Audi is currently fighting back after a ""very challenging"" 2024 in which it faced severe headwinds in the form of supply chain challenges, global political tensions and increased Chinese competition. Ultimately, the firm posted a 12% drop in deliveries, a significant 7.6% dip in overall revenues and a dramatic drop in profits of more than three percentage points.

With the company warning that 2025 ""will not be any easier"", Döllner recently spoke of the need to ""make Audi future-proof again"" by cutting costs across the whole organisation and remodelling its future strategy ""with the courage to break new ground and with confidence in our traditional strengths"".

Audi said the Concept C embodies this strategic rethink with a ""reduced and timeless aesthetic that will continue to differentiate the company in times of increased competition"".

""It is a tangible interpretation of the new design philosophy, a symbol of the determination that will transform our company and the entire brand,"" said Frascella, referring to the new approach as ""the radical next"".

Already, in its quest for simplicity and clarity, Audi has reversed the oft-critiqued decision to give electric cars even model numbers and ICE cars odd - a strategy that customers and dealers said was inviting confusion and making the model range hierarchy unclear.

Clues to the future

As a design showcase, the Concept C introduces several new features and cues that will be rolled out across the Audi line-up in due course, but it is intended as more than a mere show car - and Frascella told Autocar it will make production in almost this exact form in two years' time.

""The car that you see here is a preview of a production car - almost literally,"" he said, confirming 2027 as an expected launch date.

The Mk4 TT will be one of the first entrants into a nascent electric sports car segment - with concerns over weight, cost and driver engagement commonly cited as barriers to growth in this sector. Frascella acknowledged the challenges but said: ""How great if we are the ones that change that perception."" He added that Audi ""would not be doing it"" if it did not see the segment as viable.

That was backed up by Döllner, who said: ""We have been looking at the market. It's not a huge market, but we believe it's a very interesting segment to have a roadster and a coupé in one concept.""

He added that the production car will remain electric-only, and there are no plans for a combustion version: ""We believe the electric drivetrain is a perfect fit. It's not a car for the race track - it's a car for country roads, for performance driving.""

But he did acknowledge the challenges in matching the engagement and tactile appeal of traditional combustion-powered sports cars, and said Audi is likely to add optional synthesised engine notes and gear shifts in a bid to enhance the sports car's dynamic appeal.

""To start, maybe we will add sounds and emotion for those who miss it. But personally, driving a convertible, I don't, I don't miss the engine sound driving around. So it's two customer groups: one for silent cruising and the other ones who want performance and sound, and we will deliver solutions for for both groups.

With regard to potential for a 'fake' gearbox, he said: ""We are investigating different strategies there. To be honest, in the first place, we thought we should not do that, but we changed our mind...

""With an electric car on the race track, I'm faster with a virtual gearbox than without, because it's a very important feedback that you get when you are trained on a car with a manual gearbox, and it's also a performance measure.""

Frascella stopped short of identifying any specific areas that could change for the production car but said: ""It's a close preview - pretty much what you see.""

Like the original TT of 1998, the Concept C's glasshouse extends to the rear of the body and appears to sit ""on"" the body, with the two halves of the car split horizontally by an accentuated shoulder line.

The two-seater features a retractable hardtop – a first for an Audi cabriolet – and 'mid-engined' proportions that are the result of a centrally mounted battery pack - a layout it will share with Porsche's upcoming 718 Boxster and 718 Cayman, which use the same specially adapted version of the Porsche-Audi developed PPE platform.

Placing the batteries in the centre of the chassis, rather than under the floor, allows an electric sports car to have its seats closer to the ground, optimises weight distribution and keeps the centre of gravity as low as possible - all attributes that help to make them feel like 'traditional' ICE sports cars.

The Concept C, which is described as driveable, uses a single motor at the rear, but the production version will be available with a range-topping twin-motor arrangement - although no power figures have been given.

One of the most notable elements that will be carried over to production cars is a new upright grille design which harks back not just to the earliest Audi models (including the Type C racer) but also cars like the C6-generation Audi A6 from 2004.

Described as ""a progressive interpretation of Audi's legacy"", this new-look centrepiece is used to more prominently showcase the brand's four-ring logo and to house the ""forward-looking technology"" that will feature on next-generation models - including ADAS cameras and sensors.

In taking inspiration from the Type C and original TT, Audi is seeking to leverage its heritage as a means of strengthening its identity in an increasingly competitive market - much as BMW is doing with the Neue Klasse, Renault with the 4 and 5 and Fiat with the 500 and Panda.

Asked whether there is a risk that nostalgia-influenced designs could become repetitive, Frascella told Autocar: ""Retro is always a risk, but what we're trying to do here is not to look back and just do what was done before; we're just looking back to understand our heritage and to build on our DNA.""

The Concept C's distinctive new light signatures, with Audi's four-ring motif echoed in the LED patterns, will also make it to showrooms - a decision that Audi said will make its cars more recognisable on the road at night.

Frascella was most recently employed as a designer of some of the largest SUVs on European roads - the Range Rover and Discovery, for example, being a far cry from this compact two-seater, but he said there is no particular challenge in applying his thinking to radically different segments.

""I've worked on cars of any size and shape over 30 years, so there's very little to no adjustment. What is more important than the size is that you understand what you're doing and what you're trying to bring out.""

He added that the minimalist, almost bare-bones approach taken with the Concept C can be applied to various extents across segments, rather than being reserved for smaller, more driver-focused models.

He said: ""If you can do it with Range Rover... Once you have a very clear understanding of what you want to do as a design iconography, you can apply it to different products and a different experience.

""So an A8 wouldn't be just a stretched version of this, just with a longer wheelbase and roof, but it will take the principle of this design and it will be applied to the car [in a way] that is appropriate.""

Reinvention inside and out

The Concept C's resemblance to Audi's seminal sports coupé is no coincidence, the launch of the original Bauhaus-style TT having been a formative moment for Frascella.

""In 1998, when the first Audi TT arrived at a dealership in Turin, I took a day off work to just look at the car in peace,"" he said. ""I was there for hours, looking at the car from every angle, touching every surface.

""The staff probably thought I was crazy. But for me, the TT was more than just a car. It was a message: you don't need to shout to be heard. You don't need excess to make a statement. You just need clarity. And, more importantly, the courage to follow it.""

Clarity and simplicity, then, are themes that will define Audi's future production cars - making good on Frascella's initial pledge to usher in a ""timeless and sophisticated design language"".

This thinking will also apply to the interiors of the new cars, as showcased by the Concept C's minimalist, driver-focused cockpit.

Audi has fabricated the physical controls from anodised aluminium to give ""a tactile experience that reflects mechanical quality"", and has engineered them to ensure they make ""the unmistakable 'Audi click'"" when operated.

A foldable 10.4in screen in the centre console ensures that technology ""is always close by yet never dominant"", providing ""information in an intuitive way and in context, tailored to every situation"".

Overall, Audi said, the balance between traditional physical controls and 'shy' digital technology means ""the controls are exactly where they are expected to be"".

Meanwhile, the multifunction steering wheel is round rather than squared-off as it is in Audi's current models, and the Audi badge in the middle is made from real metal, emphasising the company's renewed focus on authenticity and physical appeal.

Audi: what's coming next?

The first beneficiary of Frascella's new-school approach is expected to be the next-generation Q7, which is understood to have been designed prior to his arrival for a launch in early 2026 but was pulled back into the studio for a late redesign according to the new principles. The production version of the Concept C, though, will be the first car styled entirely according to the new design language.

Frascella will also oversee the final design of crucial upcoming models, including the 'A2 E-tron', an entry-level EV that will replace the A1 and Q2 next year; the electric A4, due later this decade'; and a luxury EV flagship in the mould of the A8, originally known as 'Project Landjet'. A range-topping SUV, set to be called the Q9, is also on the cards as a full-blown rival to the Range Rover that Frascella designed in his previous role.

Audi said that ""performance models from Audi Sport"" are among its planned unveilings next year – likely to be tied into its entry into Formula 1 next season – likely referring to the next-generation RS5 and RS6, both set to be launched in the coming months.

Separately, Audi is understood to be working on a third-generation R8 supercar, which will use a 900bhp-plus V8-engined plug-in hybrid system shared with the Lamborghini Temerario - much as the previous R8s were related to the Gallardo and Hurácan.

“With or without the tax credit, these improvements bring energy savings that lower energy bills,” he said.","The “one big beautiful bill” that President Donald Trump signed into law in July is set to upend many aspects of American life, including climate policy. The law, which Republicans backed en masse, not only derails the nation’s efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it could also strike a blow to consumers’ pocketbooks.

From a climate perspective, the legislation’s most significant rollbacks are aimed at industries such as renewable energy, not individuals. But there will be very real impacts for taxpayers hoping to decarbonize their homes.

The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, provided tax credits for climate-friendly purchases ranging from heat pumps to solar arrays through 2032. That time frame has been cut to as little as a few months.

“This bill is going to take away a lot of assistance from consumers,” said Lowell Ungar, director of federal policy for the nonprofit American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. He noted that two million people used the home improvement tax credit in its first year alone.

The good news is that the law does not affect the billions of dollars that the IRA already sent to state efficiency and electrification rebate programs, and that much of that money will remain available beyond the federal sunsets. But, Ungar added, the tax credits can still save people thousands of dollars before they vanish.

“If consumers are able to make the investment now,” he said, “it will help them out.”

For those looking to act, Grist shares a roundup of when credits will go away.

Buy an EV before October

New electric vehicles that meet federal domestic manufacturing requirements qualify for a tax credit of up to $7,500. While credits on foreign-made EVs aren’t offered directly to consumers, automakers do get them and often pass the savings along through leases. Used EVs under $25,000 that are purchased at a dealer are also eligible for up to a $4,000 credit.

All of this goes away on September 30. There will be no credits after that. Ultimately, this will make new electric vehicles more expensive and put the technology further out of reach for low- to moderate-income Americans.

The income caps on the EV credits still apply, limiting the benefit on new EVs to those households earning less than $300,000 and on used vehicles to those earning less than $150,000. There is an MSRP limit of $80,000 for new cars, too.

Strangely, the tax credit for installing an EV charger (up to $1,000) runs through June of next year.

Make home improvements by the end of the year

The remarkably vast Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit provides up to $2,000 toward qualified heat pumps, water heaters, biomass stoves, or biomass boilers. It offers another $1,200 toward efficiency upgrades such as insulation, doors, windows, and even home energy audits.

These are going away on December 31. All items must be “placed in service” by then to qualify, though a reminder: Tax credits lower your tax liability but don’t come back as rebates. You must have a tax bill to benefit, which may not be the case for certain low-income households.

Pay for solar this year

The most valuable IRA incentive being axed is the Residential Clean Energy Credit. It covers 30 percent of clean energy systems such as solar panels, wind turbines, and geothermal heat pumps, and there is no cap. With the average cost of a solar system in the U.S. just north of $28,000, that means a tax credit would be worth around $8,500. That credit vanishes at the end of this year, though the law refers to the “expenditures” being made by then, so that could mean paying for — but not necessarily installing — a system by then.

Like with other credits, Ungar suggests confirming any changes with a tax professional. He also said that the potential for higher tariffs is another reason to move quickly. But, he said, even after the credits go away, many of these improvements could still make financial sense over the long term.

“With or without the tax credit, these improvements bring energy savings that lower energy bills,” he said. “In some cases, improvements are going to be a no-brainer regardless.”",https://cdn3.creativecirclemedia.com/walterboro/original/,N,,2025-09-05 22:59:42.901905

This includes solar inverters, battery energy storage systems, EVs, and grid-interactive appliances—all energy assets that can be aggregated and managed intelligently to reduce system-wide peaks.
Demand Response: Legacy Meets Modernization One of the longest-standing tools in a utility’s toolbox, demand response has evolved dramatically from the radio-activated HVAC switches of the 1970s.
Today, with broadband and IoT capabilities, demand response programs are increasingly powered by smart thermostats and other connected devices.
Unlike traditional demand response, which depends on customer behavior, TDC delivers precise, pre-modeled load reductions, removing uncertainty from demand flexibility events that involve behind-the-meter DER assets.","With national electricity demand surging—driven by artificial intelligence (AI) and data center developments, widespread electrification, and challenging legislative and regulatory policy shifts—utilities are scrambling to keep pace. Add to that mounting supply chain strain and aging infrastructure, and it’s no wonder utilities are facing a costly balancing act.

Just two years ago, analysts estimated a cost of $2.5 trillion by 2030 to upgrade the U.S. grid, and that number continues to climb in tandem with demand growth and climate-driven disruptions. In 2023 alone, U.S. utilities spent more than $78 billion on transmission and distribution infrastructure.

COMMENTARY

While large-scale grid modernization is unavoidable, one immediate and cost-effective path forward already exists: optimizing the behind-the-meter (BTM) distributed energy resources (DERs) that are often already available in communities.

These assets—rooftop solar, smart thermostats, electric vehicle (EV) chargers, battery storage, and more—are already in homes and businesses across the country (Figure 1). With the right management strategy, BTM DERs can play a central role in expanding virtual power plant (VPP) capacity, reducing demand during peak periods, and ultimately defraying the need for costly new power plants and transmission investments.

Supply Chain, Policy Pressures Add to Infrastructure Constraints

Utility leaders aren’t just challenged by surging demand. They’re also contending with material shortages, regulatory headwinds, and trade policies that complicate long-term planning. For example, transformer backlogs remain a critical issue, with delivery lead times exceeding three years in some cases. Meanwhile, tariffs on solar and battery components have caused uncertainty in DER adoption and slowed progress on distributed generation. New appliance standards rollbacks are also expected to drive up residential and commercial energy use. At the same time, ongoing global tensions around critical minerals and manufacturing are disrupting supply chains across energy sectors.

This article is part of POWER’s annual special edition published in partnership with the RE+ trade show. This year’s event is scheduled for Sept. 8-11, 2025, in Las Vegas, Nevada. Click here to read the entire special issue, and if you’re attending RE+, be sure to connect with the POWER team at our booth on Venetian Level 1—V3046.

Fortunately, many DERs—particularly those behind the meter—are already deployed and waiting to be activated. With proper integration through Grid-Edge distributed energy resource management systems (DERMS), these customer-sited assets can support demand flexibility programs that reduce stress on the grid.

Programs such as demand response, EV managed charging, and virtual power plants offer the potential to both redistribute energy back to the grid and/or dynamically reduce or shift load during critical times. In doing so, utilities can avoid expensive energy market purchases, maintain grid stability, and defer large capital projects.

Growing the Virtual Power Plant Footprint

The Department of Energy estimates that the U.S. will need between 80 GW to 160 GW of additional VPP capacity—roughly 10% to 20% of national peak load—by 2030. As of 2023, the country had achieved only 30 GW to 60 GW, mostly through demand response. Already, states are beginning to act. For instance, Virginia utilities are now required to submit VPP pilot proposals to regulators, highlighting a growing recognition that DER aggregation must play a central role in energy planning.

By definition, virtual power plants coordinate the performance of numerous DERs to operate collectively as a dispatchable energy resource. This includes solar inverters, battery energy storage systems, EVs, and grid-interactive appliances—all energy assets that can be aggregated and managed intelligently to reduce system-wide peaks.

Demand Response: Legacy Meets Modernization

One of the longest-standing tools in a utility’s toolbox, demand response has evolved dramatically from the radio-activated HVAC switches of the 1970s. Today, with broadband and IoT capabilities, demand response programs are increasingly powered by smart thermostats and other connected devices.

More than 10 million U.S. households currently participate in some form of demand response, helping shave over a terawatt of load annually. And with smart thermostat penetration expected to grow well beyond the current 16% of broadband-connected homes, the opportunity for further expansion is substantial.

Regulatory developments are reinforcing this trend. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has recently expanded the regulatory framework for demand response participation, further legitimizing it as a dispatchable asset in organized markets.

EV Charging: A New Frontier in Load Flexibility

EV adoption may have slowed in recent months, but the long-term trajectory is still upward, and with it, a major opportunity for load management.

EV charging represents the most dynamic type of BTM load, with managed charging programs that pause or shift load during peak periods now common across leading utility service areas. Advanced programs include vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capabilities, which discharge stored battery energy back to the grid during high-demand windows.

Moreover, EV telematics—a technology that transmits real-time data directly from vehicles—allows utilities to gather invaluable insights about charging behavior and mobility patterns. This improves forecasting and program performance, providing grid operators greater visibility into load shaping opportunities.

Grid-Edge DERMS: Unlocking the Full Potential of BTM

Not all DERMS platforms are created equal. Grid DERMS solutions manage utility-owned assets. In contrast, Grid-Edge DERMS platforms focus on managing customer-sited DERs, introducing variables—like opt-in rates, customer attrition, and device diversity—that must be handled intelligently.

To address these challenges, utilities are increasingly turning to advanced solutions like Topline Demand Control (TDC). TDC leverages AI, model predictive control, and localized forecasting to ensure predictable outcomes from decentralized assets. Unlike traditional demand response, which depends on customer behavior, TDC delivers precise, pre-modeled load reductions, removing uncertainty from demand flexibility events that involve behind-the-meter DER assets.

Final Thought: Meet Demand Without Building

The urgency to modernize America’s electric grid is evident, but utilities must remain strategic. New construction is not only capital-intensive and resource-constrained—it’s slow. By contrast, behind-the-meter DERs are already available, already installed, and ready to be integrated into advanced load flexibility programs. Leveraging these assets through VPPs and Grid-Edge DERMS platforms offers a faster, smarter, and more affordable path to grid resiliency—one that meets demand without breaking the bank.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/figure-1-courtesy-autogrid-for-virtual-peaker.png,N,,2025-09-05 22:59:29.871107

He can’t help himself,” said Telemetry analyst Sam Abuelsamid who follows Tesla stock, which has plummeted 27% from its December high.
The plunge in Tesla sales this year was largely due to blowback over Musk’s affiliation with President Donald Trump.
Tesla sales have fallen precipitously in Europe after Musk aligned with a far-right political party in German.
The EV company is set to hold its annual shareholders meeting on Nov. 6, where investors will vote on the new pay package.","The world's richest man could become its first trillionaire if Elon Musk hits a series of extremely aggressive targets for his electric car company over the next decade, according to a proposed pay package released by the company.

Tesla said in a regulatory filing Friday that it will hand Musk shares worth as much as 12% of the company in a dozen separate packages if the company meets certain performance targets, including massive increases in car production, share price and operating profit. If approved by shareholders, the new pay package could make Musk the world’s first trillion dollar executive, and would mark a new level of outsized pay in a country already known for extreme compensation. But the payoff is in shares, not cash, and the goals are extreme as well.

Musk overcame doubters to turn Tesla into the world's most valuable car company, but he could face even steeper odds in hitting the targets set by the company's compensation committee — not least because of Tesla’s main business of making electric vehicles is currently in a slump, in part because of Musk's foray into right-wing politics.

“It doesn’t matter how much money he gets. He can’t help himself,” said Telemetry analyst Sam Abuelsamid who follows Tesla stock, which has plummeted 27% from its December high. “And the more he talks, the more he turns off potential customers.”

To get his first package of shares equivalent to 1% of the company, Musk would have to convince investors in the stock market that Tesla is worth $2 trillion in total, double what they value it today, and also hit several other milestones. To receive all the shares offered and make him the world’s first trillion-dollar man would require that market value to then rise to $8.5 trillion, double that of the world’s most valuable company now, chipmaker Nvidia.

Among other goals, sales of all Tesla vehicles would eventually also have to reach 20 million, nearly triple its entire sales since it was founded more than two decades ago. Musk would also have to vastly expand Tesla's robot and robotaxi businesses by selling a million of the bots and a million of the driverless cabs, the latter a business that has only begun to roll out its taxi service and is behind rivals, such as Waymo.

Musk would also need to remain with Tesla for at least seven and a half years to cash out on any stock, and 10 years to earn the full amount.

Musk has been one of the richest people in the world for several years. He is currently estimated to be worth more than $400 billion by Forbes magazine.

A condition of the 11th and 12th tranches of the plan includes Musk coming up with a framework for someone to succeed him as CEO.

The plunge in Tesla sales this year was largely due to blowback over Musk’s affiliation with President Donald Trump. Tesla also faces intensifying competition from the big Detroit automakers and particularly from China.

Tesla sales have fallen precipitously in Europe after Musk aligned with a far-right political party in German. Sales plunged 40% in July in the 27 European Union countries compared with the year earlier even as sales overall of electric vehicle soared, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association. Meanwhile sales of Chinese rival BYD continued to climb fast, grabbing 1.1% market share of all car sales in the month versus Tesla’s 0.7%.

Without a reversal of those trends, meeting the financial goals could prove especially difficult. In its most recent quarter, Tesla reported that quarterly profits plunged from $1.39 billion to $409 million. Revenue also fell and the company came up short of even the lowered expectations on Wall Street.

Investors have grown increasingly worried about the trajectory of the company after Musk had spent so much time in Washington this year, becoming one of the most prominent officials in the Trump administration in its bid to slash the size of the U.S. government.

Even bulls on the stock are not convinced the new pay incentive will keep Musk, who frequently posts on his X social media platform, from saying things that alienate potential buyers.

Said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, “Fixing the Musk brand damage remains a work in progress."" Even so, Ives told clients, “We believe this was the smart move by the Board as the biggest asset for Tesla is Musk.”

In January 2024, a Delaware judge threw out Musk’s previous pay package, worth $44.9 billion at the time. Investors voted to restore that compensation package at Tesla’s last shareholders meeting on June 13 of last year. But late last year the package was revoked for a second time. Tesla has appealed the ruling. Last month, Tesla said that it gave Musk a stock grant of $29 billion as a reward for years of “transformative and unprecedented” growth — despite the drop in sales and profits — and noting that the CEO hadn’t been paid in years.

The EV company is set to hold its annual shareholders meeting on Nov. 6, where investors will vote on the new pay package. Musk would also receive more voting power over Tesla under the proposed plan. Musk has said that he needed more shares and control so he couldn’t be ousted by shareholder activists. If he does hit all the goals, Musk would own about quarter of the company’s shares, up from 13% today.

On Maintaining FERC’s Independence

Heinrich began his questioning, urging the nominees to preserve FERC’s independence, “Earlier this year, President Trump signed an Executive Order asserting to give the White House greater control over independent agencies. As both of you know, FERC is a statutorily independent agency with a very clearly defined mandate. So, Ms. Swett, let me start with you. Can you tell me why maintaining FERC's independence is so critical?”

Swett answered, “Thank you for the question, Senator. Maintaining FERC’s independence is critical because that is exactly how Congress created the agency in the DOE Organization Act of 1978. Congress carved work out of DOE’s jurisdiction and explicitly provides that no FERC action is under review by anyone at DOE. And thus, as a lawyer who has been practicing FERC law for 15 years, I will always go back to the statute, and that is exactly what Congress directed, and I will not exceed the jurisdiction that Congress has given the agency if I am confirmed.”

Heinrich followed up, “Mr. LaCerte, same question.”

LaCerte answered, “Thank you, Senator, for the question. First, want to say I certainly am no stranger to the value of the assertion of independence and independent agencies. Having spent time at the CSB as Acting Managing Director, Acting General Counsel, Executive Council and Senior Advisor to the Chairman, I'm very familiar with navigating independent agencies, and I think that the independence of FERC is derived from its individual structure. Being commissioners, those five individuals have an independent voice. It's important that we nominate people and confirm people that that honor that independence and follow the law and apply the facts.”

On Powering Our Energy Grid with Clean Energy

Heinrich asked the nominees about the importance of ensuring we power our grid with more energy as Americans face an affordably energy crisis, “According to EIA Data, despite all that we've heard about affordability today, household electric bills are up 10% nationally since the beginning of this Administration in less than a year actually, double digit increase in electric bills. Former Republican FERC Chairman Chatterjee has said that we need every single available electron on the grid. Both of you have referenced the increased demand as a result of data centers and artificial intelligence. Would you agree that in the face of incredible rising demand, probably the greatest demand increase we've seen since the onset of air conditioning, that the grid right now requires more, not less, affordable and reliable energy, Ms. Swett?”

Swett answered, “Thank you for the question, Senator. I absolutely agree with you that the grid needs more generation and more reliable generation, and that we should do whatever we can to ensure that the lights are on. That said, under the Federal Power Act, Congress has explicitly stated that FERC’s mission is to ensure that there is no undue discrimination in the rates that are charged pursuant to its jurisdiction. And I agree with that, of course, for Congress' wisdom, and if I have the honor of being confirmed, I will honor that in every matter that I examine.”

Heinrich continued, “Let's take that one, one step deeper down, right now and for the next several years, actually, probably for at least the next four. 95% of the projects slated to come onto the grid to serve that demand are represented by wind, solar, and battery storage. We don't have, when you look at other generation sources, they're not already in the queue, things like combined cycle natural gas has a five-year waiting period for combined cycle natural gas turbines. Nuclear obviously has permitting challenges that oftentimes it takes 10 years to get nuclear generation built. What would the impact be if we, without replacement generation, took that 95% out of the pipeline of oncoming generation?”

Swett answered, “Thank you for the question, Senator. As a humble lawyer who is not an economist or a scientist, I'm not going to try to guess what the impact of taking that huge amount out of the queue would be. However, it is incredibly important that we thoughtfully ensure that as much generation is available as necessary to meet the unprecedented demand that our country is facing that will rise with every passing year. So, I commit to you that if I have the honor of being confirmed, then I will take a hard look at the matters before me, including interconnection, which I understand is under challenge in several federal courts at this time. So, I don't want to pre-judge anything, but if it comes before me and I am confirmed, then I will do everything I can to work with my colleagues to come to a solution.”

Heinrich countered, “I'm not an economist, but as the son of a lineman, I can tell you that if we took that generation out of the pipeline, we would see incredible increasing costs, and that's why I think everyone at this dais is incredibly concerned about that.”

On Generator Technology Being Considered for Permitting Decisions and LaCerte’s Professional History

Heinrich asked, “Mr. LaCerte, can you commit to maintaining FERC’s independence and commit that a generator's technology, which traditionally has not been considered when making interconnection decisions, permitting decisions that FERC will maintain its agnostic approach to generation?”

LaCerte responded, “Thank you for the question. Senator, as my potential colleague, Laura, has noted that under the law, we must remain neutral as it relates to such decisions, will always follow the law.”

Heinrich followed, “Mr. LaCerte, the baseline statute, I think that was the word you used. The baseline statute for FERC requires that the Chairman and members of the Commission shall be individuals who by demonstrated ability, background training, or experienced artists are specially qualified to assess fairly the needs and concerns of all interests affected by federal energy policy. Do I understand it that you have not represented clients before the FERC Correct?”

LaCerte answered, “Correct, I have not represented clients before FERC, Senator, and I believe that that is a strength of mine and not a negative. As Former Chairman Christie has noted in his swan song departing this Commission, that there's a real fear of regulatory capture of FERC. So I think a fresh perspective and a common-sense approach amongst one of the five members would be a welcome addition.”

Heinrich continued, “So you've never signed any pleading on a client's behalf on FERC on any matter?”

LaCerte answered, “Correct.”

House Republicans on Wednesday night voted largely along party lines to repeal land management plans adopted in the closing days of former President Joe Biden's administration that restricted development in large areas of Alaska, Montana and North Dakota.

Biden's goal was in part to reduce climate-warming emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. Under Trump, Republicans are casting aside those aspirations as they open more taxpayer-owned land to development, hoping to create more jobs and revenue.

“This is a great day for Americans across the country as we continue our work to unleash our natural resources, support local economies and communities and strengthen our energy and national security,” said Arkansas Republican Rep. Bruce Westerman, who chairs the House Natural Resources Committee.

The Republican-majority Senate must still approve the House action, and some lawmakers already have expressed support.

Democrats had urged rejection of the repeals, which were accomplished using a procedure known as the Congressional Review Act that allows lawmakers to undo actions taken by the executive branch.

“Republicans preside over an economy in which everything is getting more expensive,” Rep. Joe Neguse, a Colorado Democrat, said during debate on the measures. “Their answer to all of this? More coal.”

Trump declared a “national energy emergency” in January as he sought to speed approvals for oil, gas and coal projects.

On Thursday, the Bureau of Land Management announced the first coal lease awarded to a private company during Trump's current term — 18.3 million tons (16.6 million metric tonnes) of the fuel at the Freedom Mine near Beulah, North Dakota. Coteau Property Companies bought the lease for $106,000 and must submit royalty payments on the coal it extracts.

The sale had been scheduled before Wednesday's votes by lawmakers.

Administration officials in July announced their intention to undo the Biden-era land use plans, aiming to open more areas to mining and development. That could take months or even years through the usual rulemaking process.

By contrast, a Congressional repeal would go into effect quickly, setting the stage for the administration to execute pending proposals to sell tens of millions of tons of coal beneath public lands in Montana and North Dakota.

In Alaska, the state's lone U.S. House member, Republican Nick Begich, said repealing the management plan for the central Yukon region would open access to critical minerals and help support a proposed liquefied natural gas project. Opponents, including a consortium of 40 federally recognized tribes, worry a repeal would put subsistence harvests at risk because the lands include important habitat for salmon and caribou.

Wednesday's votes marked the first time Congress has used the review act in a bid to overturn a land use plan, said Neguse.

An earlier attempt by Republicans to open more federal lands to development called for the sale of more than 2 million acres (809,372 hectares) to states or other entities. That proposal, from Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee, was excluded from the GOP’s big tax and spending cuts bill amid fierce opposition from some fellow Republicans.

The Bureau of Land Management, which is part of the Interior Department, oversees the lands covered by the disputed management plans.

Many EPA employees received notice on Thursday that they had either been suspended for two weeks without pay, or that they were on “notice of proposed removal” from their jobs, according to the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents more than 8,000 EPA employees.
Six of the fired employees were probationary workers and two were career federal employees.
EPA employees who weren’t outright fired, however, are now awaiting the agency’s final call on what comes next.
The initial June 30 “declaration of dissent” was signed by a combination of named and anonymous EPA employees.","Federal employees at the Environmental Protection Agency are now in limbo after EPA suspended dozens of workers who signed a dissent letter criticizing Administrator Lee Zeldin’s management of the agency.

Many EPA employees received notice on Thursday that they had either been suspended for two weeks without pay, or that they were on “notice of proposed removal” from their jobs, according to the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents more than 8,000 EPA employees.

The two-week suspensions come after EPA last week moved forward with fully firing at least eight employees who had signed a “declaration of dissent” in June. Six of the fired employees were probationary workers and two were career federal employees.

EPA employees who weren’t outright fired, however, are now awaiting the agency’s final call on what comes next. It’s unclear exactly how many of the 140 EPA employees who signed the dissent letter were suspended or put on “notice of proposed removal.” When asked for details on how many employees fell into each category, an agency spokesperson said, “EPA does not comment on individual personnel matters.”

But according to a recent survey that AFGE conducted, around 40 EPA employees reported being suspended without pay, while at least nine received the “notice of proposed removal” this week. Usually during a “notice of proposed removal,” federal employees get seven days to respond to the notice — after which the agency gets 30 days to make a final decision on the fate of the employee’s job.

Justin Chen, president of AFGE Council 238, which represents EPA employees, said the agency’s actions have been “scattershot.” Many employees requested extensions to provide responses to the notices. The agency granted some extensions, but not others, Chen said.

The firings and suspensions have impacted EPA researchers, scientists, engineers, toxicologists and attorneys — among many other agency roles. Some of the impacted EPA employees are senior-level subject matter experts.

“It’s going to significantly hamper the mission, just like everything else [the Trump administration has] done to the workers here within the agency,” Chen said in an interview. “We weren’t a huge agency in the first place, and we were all already underwater — this is just going to make everything worse.”

Additionally, due to EPA recently ending its recognition of AFGE and terminating its union contract, Chen said supporting the impacted employees has become more complicated. The federal union can no longer charge official time hours to represent the impacted workers. AFGE officials can also no longer serve as stewards to represent employees in meetings with EPA leadership.

“Management does not play along anymore,” Chen said.

The initial June 30 “declaration of dissent” was signed by a combination of named and anonymous EPA employees. It warned that the Trump administration’s leadership at EPA was “recklessly undermining” the agency’s mission by reversing long-standing policies and regulatory standards on the agency’s scientific assessments and findings.

“Make no mistake,” the employees wrote, “Your actions endanger public health and erode scientific progress — not only in America — but around the world.”

An EPA spokesperson said the employees’ letter “contains inaccurate information designed to mislead the public about agency business.”

“Thankfully, this represents a small fraction of the thousands of hard-working, dedicated EPA employees who are not trying to mislead and scare the American public,” the EPA spokesperson added.

In early July, EPA leadership launched an investigation into the approximately 140 employees who had signed the letter. The investigation was meant to wrap up after two weeks, but ultimately lasted for nearly two months. An EPA spokesperson said following the investigation, agency supervisors made personnel decisions “on an individualized basis.”

“The Environmental Protection Agency has a zero-tolerance policy for career officials using their agency position and title to unlawfully undermine, sabotage and undercut the will of the American public that was clearly expressed at the ballot box last November,” the spokesperson said.

Federal employees at the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health and the Federal Emergency Management Agency have similarly sent letters criticizing the Trump administration’s management of the federal agencies, and warning of disastrous consequences. Earlier this week, over 1,000 employees at the Department of Health and Human Services also called for the resignation of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.

“We intend to stand by our members,” Chen said. “We will hold together in solidarity, continue pushing forward, and hold our oath to uphold the Constitution, as well as public health within this country.”

The goals set out for Musk and Tesla are extremely ambitious given recent tumult at the Texas company.
Meanwhile sales of Chinese rival BYD continued to climb fast, grabbing 1.1% market share of all car sales in the month versus Tesla’s 0.7%.
The award arrived eight months after a judge revoked Musk’s 2018 pay package for a second time, something the company noted in August.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk could be in line for a payout of $1 trillion if his electric car company meets a series of extremely aggressive targets over the next 10 years, according to documents released by the company.

Tesla, which is leaning heavily into robotics and AI, said in a regulatory filing on Friday that the package has a dozen share tranches that include awards for Musk if targets, ranging from car production to the total value of the company, are met over that time period.

Very early in the plan, Tesla would have to reach a market valuation of $2 trillion and achieve 20 million vehicles deliveries. Tesla delivered less than 2 million vehicles in 2024.

That milestone would also required a million robotaxis in commercial operation and the delivery of 1 million artificial intelligence bots.

Musk needs to remain with Tesla for at least seven and a half years to cash out on any stock, and 10 years to earn the full amount.

Musk has been one of the richest people in the world for several years.

Musk would also receive more voting power over Tesla under the proposed plan. The EV company is set to hold its annual shareholders meeting on Nov. 6. Tesla’s last shareholders meeting was on June 13 of last year, where investors voted to restore Musk’s record $44.9 billion pay package that was thrown out by a Delaware judge earlier that year.

A condition of the 11th and 12th tranches of the plan includes Musk coming up with a framework for someone to succeed him as CEO.

The goals set out for Musk and Tesla are extremely ambitious given recent tumult at the Texas company.

Tesla shares have plunged 25% this year largely due to blowback over Musk’s affiliation with President Donald Trump. But Tesla also faces intensifying competition from the big Detroit automakers and particularly from China.

Telsa sales have fallen precipitously in Europe after Musk aligned with a far-right political party in German.

Sales plunged 40% in July in the 27 European Union countries compared with the year earlier even as sales overall of electric vehicle soared, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association. Meanwhile sales of Chinese rival BYD continued to climb fast, grabbing 1.1% market share of all car sales in the month versus Tesla’s 0.7%.

In its most recent quarter, Tesla reported that quarterly profits plunged from $1.39 billion to $409 million. Revenue also fell and the company fell short of even the lowered expectations on Wall Street.

Investors have grown increasingly worried about the trajectory of the company after Musk had spent so much time in Washington this year, becoming one of the most prominent officials in the Trump administration in its bid to slash the size of the U.S. government.

Last month Tesla said that it gave Musk a stock grant of $29 billion as a reward for years of “transformative and unprecedented” growth despite a recent foray into right-wing politics that has hurt its sales, profits and its stock price.

The award arrived eight months after a judge revoked Musk’s 2018 pay package for a second time, something the company noted in August.

Today in POLITICO Energy’s podcast: Kelsey Tamborrino breaks down House Republicans’ latest moves on energy and federal spending.","Donald Trump made it clear early in his presidency that he intended to bring independent agencies under the control of the White House.

Now Trump and his deputies are getting to work, hacking away at regulatory agencies Congress established as neutral arbiters in managing the U.S. economy. Persistent attacks on the U.S. central bank and antitrust police have threatened to shake global markets.

Attracting less public attention — but critical to the American energy economy and the environment — is what’s happening at two agencies: one charged with overseeing the electric grid and natural gas pipelines, and the other with ensuring nuclear power is safe.

Rising pressure on the NRC and FERC

That boiled over during Senate hearings this week, with lawmakers pressing Republican nominees for seats on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and bipartisan members of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission about whether their agencies would keep their independence. Are they insulated from politics — or working at the pleasure of the president?

“The commission was designed to serve no president, no political party and no political agenda,” Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, the top Democrat on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said on Thursday, referring to FERC.

But Trump has an ultimate source of leverage over agency autonomy: his willingness to fire or push out confirmed members of these commissions, forcing court challenges and bringing to a head questions about the reach of executive power, Nico Portuondo writes.

David LaCerte, one of two pending Trump nominees for seats at FERC, has worked at the White House Office of Personnel Management since January. The former Louisiana official said he’d “personally welcome” a Supreme Court ruling overturning a 1935 decision that limits a president’s ability to fire regulators. But he also told senators he would “do the utmost of my ability under the law to maintain the independence of FERC.”

‘We don’t rubber stamp’

The White House’s challenge to NRC independence has burbled under the surface for months, finally attracting attention from Capitol Hill, Nico Portuondo and Francisco “A.J.” Camacho report.

The NRC has its roots in the years just after World War II, when President Harry Truman shifted control over atomic energy from the military to a new agency called the Atomic Energy Commission. In the 1970s, Congress created an independent NRC to regulate nuclear safety as a wave of nuclear plants came online.

The Trump administration and an industry now partly rooted in Silicon Valley are pushing for a nuclear resurgence. Part of the effort is to hand some of the NRC’s power to the Department of Energy — run by Secretary Chris Wright, who advocates for speedier nuclear licensing.

Under a Trump executive order signed in May, the Defense Department could also get a role in testing and moving new nuclear designs relatively quickly.

Questions about NRC independence swelled after POLITICO’s E&E News reported in July that a Trump administration official said the commission would be expected to “rubber-stamp” nuclear designs that get approval from Energy and Defense.

“But we pushed back and said, ‘We don’t rubber-stamp,’” NRC Chair David Wright told senators on Wednesday.

Trump’s likely to put that promise to the test.

Coal safety jobs on chopping block

More than 570 workers who oversee mine health and safety could lose their jobs as the Trump administration looks to ramp up mining and slash the federal workforce, Hannah Northey writes.

Mine safety research divisions at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health are on the chopping block, threatening the nation’s ability to prevent mine collapses, explosions and diseases such as black lung.

Industry officials and Republicans from coal-heavy states have pushed back on the job cuts. A federal judge in Rhode Island granted a preliminary injunction earlier this year to halt the terminations.

Spending bill energy fights highlight GOP rift

House Republicans continue to fight over funding for energy and climate projects as they push ahead with annual appropriations bills, illustrating the challenges they face ahead of an Oct. 1 deadline to pass the bills or see a government shutdown, Andres Picon writes.

The Energy-Water spending bill passed by one vote on the House floor this week after some Republicans joined all Democrats to oppose conservative amendments to slash funding for some environment and climate programs.

Some are pushing symbolic amendments they know will fail in the name of fiscal discipline. Rep. Dave Schweikert (R-Ariz.), for example, pushed to cut $37 billion from the Energy-Water bill, including programs “I actually don’t oppose.”

A senior Democratic appropriator called it “a charade.”

“I wish the people who are the principle [critics of the spending bills] would cave earlier so we can all go home,” said House Appropriations ranking member Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.). “In the long run, that’s what they always do.”

More oversight pitched for extreme weather

A meteorologist turned lawmaker is crafting a bill to create a National Weather Safety Board to better address threats from extreme weather, Chelsea Harvey writes.

Illinois Democratic Rep. Eric Sorensen told Chelsea he’s been considering the need for years. But the deadly July floods in Central Texas spurred him to action. He sees the National Transportation Safety Board as a model.

“We are making so many advancements with respect for aviation that we don’t have many disasters anymore,” Sorensen said. “So I want to take what we’ve learned there in that process and say, ‘What could happen if we have a National Weather Safety Board?’”

Laura Swett and David LaCerte — President Donald Trump’s nominees to become commissioners at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission — told senators Thursday that if confirmed, they would uphold the agency’s independence while remaining neutral toward generating technologies.

The Republican nominees to fill two vacant seats on the five-member commission, which oversees parts of the power, natural gas, oil and hydroelectric sectors, were speaking at a confirmation hearing before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.

Swett is an energy attorney at Vinson & Elkins and former FERC staffer. She worked in FERC’s enforcement office and as an advisor to former Commissioner Bernard McNamee and former Chairman Kevin McIntyre.

LaCerte is an official in the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. Previously, he was acting managing director at the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board and a special counsel at the Baker Botts law firm for two years, starting in January 2023, working mainly on Clean Air Act-related litigation, he told the Senate panel.

“The most important qualification I have is that I can bring a common-sense approach to get problems solved and get things done,” LaCerte said.

LaCerte is also listed as a contributor to Project 2025, the conservative blueprint for dismantling the administrative state published by the Heritage Foundation.

Next, the Senate committee will vote on the nominees, who must also be approved by the full Senate before they can be seated at FERC. A Senate vote could come next month, but negotiations over appropriations and the possibility of a continuing resolution could delay action on the nominees, research firm ClearView Energy Partners said in a client note on Thursday.

The nominations come amid concerns about rising demand for power, ongoing reductions in FERC staffing, as well as the potential for the Trump administration to limit FERC’s independence.

LaCerte said he does not expect the Trump administration to order mandatory staff cuts at FERC.

“The mission of FERC is directly in line with the president’s management agenda, and I don’t foresee anyone asking that of FERC,” he said. The agency is under a hiring freeze, however, and former FERC Chairman Mark Christie said earlier this year it faces a roughly 9% cut in staff through voluntary attrition.

Key priorities include affordability, reliability amid rising demand

Swett said she had three top priorities if she is confirmed as a FERC commissioner: keeping energy costs down while maintaining reliability; facilitating the connection of new large loads like artificial intelligence data centers, which she cast as a matter of national and economic security; and facilitating power infrastructure development.

“This development has faced crippling regulatory uncertainty over the recent past, and it’s well-functioning and increase is critical to reliability, safety and our economy,” Swett said. “I actually have lost sleep a few nights worrying about how our country will meet the demand that it faces.”

For his part, LaCerte said reliability and affordability are a “bedrock” of FERC’s work.

“If confirmed … we’d ask two questions of every single action which we undertake at FERC as commissioner: ‘How does this make our grid and energy structure more reliable?’ And the second question we’d ask is, ‘Does this make our grid and infrastructure more affordable?’ And if the answer to those questions is no, then ask why we’re doing it,” LaCerte said.

Demand growth is adding to the challenges FERC is facing, according to LaCerte.

“Artificial intelligence, data centers and reindustrialization present a compounding of these issues, which will require diligent planning, forecasting and regulatory oversight from both the states as well as FERC,” he said.

The administrative burden placed on infrastructure developers is “staggering,” according to LaCerte.

“Delays in federal reviews and decision-making make energy less reliable and more expensive,” he said. “Reducing processing time and the associated administrative burden will speed projects along, allowing those cost savings to be passed to ratepayers.”

Concerns over agency independence

The nominees faced pointed questions from some senators over preserving FERC’s independence as Trump has asserted unprecedented control over other independent bodies like the Federal Reserve and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

“Destroying the independence of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission would do irreparable damage to public confidence in the commission’s decision making, to regulatory stability and to our energy security,” said Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., the committee’s ranking member.

Swett and LaCerte both said they support FERC’s status as an independent agency.

“Maintaining FERC independence is critical because that is exactly how Congress created the agency in the [Department of Energy] Organization Act of 1978,” Swett said. “Congress carved FERC out of DOE’s jurisdiction and explicitly provides that no FERC action is under review by anyone at DOE.”

LaCerte expressed a similar view.

“I’ll do the most of my ability under the law to maintain the independence of FERC, 100%,” he said.

Markets and fuel neutrality

As the Trump administration has sought to stop the development of renewable energy, particularly wind projects, Swett said FERC cannot discriminate against any type of generation.

LaCerte echoed Swett’s comments.

“The Federal Power Act requires that commissioners be neutral in those decisions,” he said. “We’re going to need more reliable base load power moving forward, and coal certainly pays an important component in that mix.”

In response to a question about hydropower, Swett said, “Given our unprecedented demand that we’re facing, getting every single molecule of electricity on the grid is of tantamount importance.”

Partly driven by rising demand, every wholesale power market is struggling with resource adequacy issues while also trying to respect state energy policies, according to Swett.

“So the best thing that FERC can do is take all of the inputs that it gets from those states and their generation choices, and every generator before it and the rates that it is considering, to ensure that just and reasonable rates are achieved for the American people under the Federal Power Act,” Swett said.

Transmission and grid-enhancing technologies

The nominees also addressed concerns over transmission and grid infrastructure.

“We need more transmission — that’s beyond debate,” LaCerte said. “Transmission is going to be part and parcel to maintaining that [demand] growth and sustaining that growth over the long term, but it’s important to note also we need to do so while protecting the ratepayers.”

LaCerte said he also remains open to grid-enhancing technologies that can make existing transmission infrastructure more efficient.

“I fully support a continued analysis and a continued encouragement of their usage as we continue to evolve in these areas and we continue to find new and innovative ways to deliver electricity,” LaCerte said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/5Y_63fVeqCRhl8S34UCNG-dEWpkNken2XDt0HKmY_OA/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9TY3JlZW5zaG90XzE1NC5wbmc=.webp,N,,2025-09-05 19:04:26.953110

And now for your environmental reports:

With 70% of the Indiana’s rivers and streams unsafe for swimming, the Hoosier state has the worst water pollution problem in the nation. A comprehensive report from the Hoosier Environmental Council reveals that over 24,000 miles of Indiana waterways are polluted—more than any other state. These pollutants come from agricultural runoff, industrial discharges, city stormwater, and emerging contaminants like poly-fluoro-alkyl substances and microplastics. PFAS chemicals were found in 100% of the fish sampled, while microplastics have been discovered in central Indiana’s White River.

There is a Prairie catalog for restoring native species. Illinois has lost 99.9% of its native tallgrass prairie, but scientists have created a powerful new tool to help bring these vital ecosystems back. Prairies are environmental powerhouses. Their deep root systems, some reaching 8 feet down, store massive amounts of carbon, prevent soil erosion, and create incredibly resilient ecosystems that support hundreds of plant, insect, and animal species.

Researchers at the University of Illinois just launched RELIX, a database that catalogs plant species from 353 surviving prairie remnants across the Midwest. These remnants are akin to postage stamps—tiny patches of original grassland that survived because they couldn’t be farmed. Commercial seed mixes are often missing many native species and this database can change that. Now restoration projects can use seed mixes that truly match what grew here naturally, creating stronger, more diverse prairies that can better withstand droughts, floods, and invasive species.

A federal appeals court ruled Tuesday that the Trump administration can proceed with terminating more than $16 billion in climate grants to nonprofit organizations. The grants, awarded under Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act to fight climate change, had been frozen by EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin who cited concerns about fraud and misalignment with the agency’s updated priorities.

More than 85 climate scientists have issued a scathing rebuttal to a new Department of Energy report, calling it full of climate science misrepresentations and outright errors. The scientists found that Energy Secretary Chris Wright handpicked the team of five climate skeptics who cherry-picked their data and ignored critical climate impacts while writing this report. Environmental groups have sued the Trump administration, alleging the report was created illegally in secret with only one viewpoint represented.

Schools in Paris are creating greening opportunities for increased wilderness, right in their very own backyards.

The study found that arthropod communities, like insects, spiders, and other small creatures, thrived in the green schoolyards at levels similar to nearby parks. These transformed urban spaces, originally designed as “cool islands,” also combat the urban heat island effect.

In North Carolina, $1,022,106 will go toward the Uwharries to Sandhills, Phase 2 project, covering Montgomery, Moore, Randolph, Richmond and Stanly counties.
It will be used to restore and improve about 18,000 acres in the Uwharrie National Forest through prescribed fire and silvicultural treatments, according to USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).

The money is just a portion of the $8 million the USDA is spending on five projects across the country aimed at decreasing wildfire risk, protecting water quality and strengthening forest health, according to the federal agency.

Wildfires are a growing concern in North Carolina, agriculture commissioner Steve Troxler said earlier this year while asking lawmakers for more funding to tackle the issue.

The risks from wildfires are “expected to get worse, not better” throughout the year, Troxler said in April, according to WRAL.

The $8 million investment across the U.S. is the latest portion of the Joint Chiefs’ Landscape Restoration Partnership Program, which is a collaboration between NRCS and Forest Service, to build public-private boundaries, according to the agency. The funding for new projects follows $32 million given to 24 existing 3-year-old Joint Chiefs’ projects.

“Wildfires have no boundaries, and neither should our prevention work,” USDA Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz said in a press release, announcing the funding. “We need everyone at the table to deliver the kind of active management that will return our forests to health and productivity.”

Other projects receiving funding are in Alabama, Montana and Oregon, and a joint project in Colorado and Wyoming.

“Providing technical and financial assistance to private forest landowners is key to supporting locally led conservation, especially in the wildland-urban interface,” NRCS Chief Aubrey Bettencourt said in the release. This allows us to address multiple challenges in one project, such as reducing the risk of catastrophic wildfire, protecting clean water, and improving wildlife habitat.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-102/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/uwharrie-1024x6811757103633.jpg?h=69f2b9d0&itok=LOfkOGU9,N,,2025-09-05 18:06:31.373745

But, Ungar added, the tax credits can still save people thousands of dollars before they vanish.
All items must be “placed in service” by then to qualify, though a reminder: Tax credits lower your tax liability but don’t come back as rebates.
“With or without the tax credit, these improvements bring energy savings that lower energy bills,” he said.","The “one big beautiful bill” that President Donald Trump signed into law in July is set to upend many aspects of American life, including climate policy. The law, which Republicans backed en masse, not only derails the nation’s efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it could also strike a blow to consumers’ pocketbooks.

From a climate perspective, the legislation’s most significant rollbacks are aimed at industries such as renewable energy, not individuals. But there will be very real impacts for taxpayers hoping to decarbonize their homes.

The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, provided tax credits for climate-friendly purchases ranging from heat pumps to solar arrays through 2032. That time frame has been cut to as little as a few months.

“This bill is going to take away a lot of assistance from consumers,” said Lowell Ungar, director of federal policy for the nonprofit American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. He noted that two million people used the home improvement tax credit in its first year alone.

The good news is that the law does not affect the billions of dollars that the IRA already sent to state efficiency and electrification rebate programs, and that much of that money will remain available beyond the federal sunsets. But, Ungar added, the tax credits can still save people thousands of dollars before they vanish.

“If consumers are able to make the investment now,” he said, “it will help them out.”

For those looking to act, Grist shares a roundup of when credits will go away.

Buy an EV before October

New electric vehicles that meet federal domestic manufacturing requirements qualify for a tax credit of up to $7,500. While credits on foreign-made EVs aren’t offered directly to consumers, automakers do get them and often pass the savings along through leases. Used EVs under $25,000 that are purchased at a dealer are also eligible for up to a $4,000 credit.

All of this goes away on September 30. There will be no credits after that. Ultimately, this will make new electric vehicles more expensive and put the technology further out of reach for low- to moderate-income Americans.

The income caps on the EV credits still apply, limiting the benefit on new EVs to those households earning less than $300,000 and on used vehicles to those earning less than $150,000. There is an MSRP limit of $80,000 for new cars, too.

Strangely, the tax credit for installing an EV charger (up to $1,000) runs through June of next year.

Make home improvements by the end of the year

The remarkably vast Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit provides up to $2,000 toward qualified heat pumps, water heaters, biomass stoves, or biomass boilers. It offers another $1,200 toward efficiency upgrades such as insulation, doors, windows, and even home energy audits.

These are going away on December 31. All items must be “placed in service” by then to qualify, though a reminder: Tax credits lower your tax liability but don’t come back as rebates. You must have a tax bill to benefit, which may not be the case for certain low-income households.

Pay for solar this year

The most valuable IRA incentive being axed is the Residential Clean Energy Credit. It covers 30 percent of clean energy systems such as solar panels, wind turbines, and geothermal heat pumps, and there is no cap. With the average cost of a solar system in the U.S. just north of $28,000, that means a tax credit would be worth around $8,500. That credit vanishes at the end of this year, though the law refers to the “expenditures” being made by then, so that could mean paying for — but not necessarily installing — a system by then.

Like with other credits, Ungar suggests confirming any changes with a tax professional. He also said that the potential for higher tariffs is another reason to move quickly. But, he said, even after the credits go away, many of these improvements could still make financial sense over the long term.

“With or without the tax credit, these improvements bring energy savings that lower energy bills,” he said. “In some cases, improvements are going to be a no-brainer regardless.”",https://images.stacker.com/s/720/1280/images/stories/2025/08/05/grist-environmental-tax-credits_0.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 20:05:06.328551

Sebastopol resident Marilyn Madrone has had a used Nissan Leaf, which she affectionately calls “LeafyLou,” for a couple of years. She ditched her old pickup truck, which was needing increasing repairs, and bought the used 2015 vehicle. She was able to save $4,000 using a PG&E incentive available for income-eligible customers. After the incentive, the car cost her $4,500.

Like many buyers of electric vehicles, Marilyn wanted to reduce her carbon footprint, lower her fuel costs and have much lower maintenance costs. While her older Nissan Leaf has a limited range of 87 miles, it suits her needs. This car can be ideal for both older or teenage drivers who want to use it primarily as a Sonoma County car.

Marilyn had some assistance with the paperwork process from Tor Allen at the Rahus Institute, which is a local nonprofit focused on climate action. Tor and his wife Dena bought a used 2020 Bolt EV and were able to take advantage of $8,000 in incentives off a list price of $18,160. The Bolt gets over 259 miles on a full charge, and they have taken it on a few 2,000-mile road trips.

Tor, Dena and Marilyn are in good company. According to City Climate Dashboard, Sebastopol leads Sonoma County with 9.8% of all registered light-duty vehicles being plug-in hybrids or fully electric. In Sonoma County, 25.3% of all new 2024 light-duty vehicles sold were plug-in electric, according to the DMV.

If you have been thinking about getting an EV, now is the time to move on it because the federal incentives are going away at the end of this month.

What you need to know about Federal Tax Credits

Federal Tax Credits are set to end September 30, 2025. These EV credits were set to expire in 2030, but Trump and a pliant Congress, in all its wisdom, decided to cancel the EV credits at the end of this month as part of the “Big Beautiful Bill.”

New Clean Vehicle Tax Credit

Up to $7,500

Vehicle price limits:

$80,000 for SUVs and pickups

$55,000 for other vehicles

Used Clean Vehicle Tax Credit

Up to $4,000 - can’t exceed 30% of sales price

Vehicle must be at least two years old.

Vehicle price limit: $25,000 for all used vehicles

There are income limits for Clean Vehicle Tax Credits for new and used vehicles:

NEW VEHICLES

$300,000 for joint filers

$225,000 for head of household

$150,000 for single filers

USED VEHICLES

$150,000 for joint filers

$112,500 for head of household

$75,000 for single filers

Tax credits are subject to income and vehicle eligibility requirements. Visit fueleconomy.gov/feg/ for qualifying vehicles. You don’t need to take delivery of your EV by 9/30/2025, just sign a contract and pay a down payment by that date, according to InsideEVs.

How to claim your tax credit

There are two ways to claim your Clean Vehicle Tax Credit: immediately at purchase or later on your taxes.

Get your tax credit immediately

Apply your credit at the point of purchase to reduce the vehicle price upfront. This requires the dealer to participate in the EV Point of Purchase program.

If purchasing from a private party, you can still claim the credit by using KeySavvy. They act as an escrow service and act as an online dealer. The process takes 1-2 days for setup and portal steps online for both the buyer and seller, then 1-3 weeks to send title/payment, and receive title/payment back from KeySavvy.

Claim on your tax return. File Form 8936 in the year you purchase your EV.

Searching for used EVs

There are many used EVs for sale that are less than $25K, such as the Ioniq5, Chevy Bolt, Nissan Leaf, Hyundai Kona, Kia Niro, and Tesla M3 or ModelS. Looking beyond Sonoma County can lead to more vehicles available at a lower price.

Financing. Buying any vehicle can be a heavy financial lift. Redwood Credit Union has some special rate discounts for EV & hybrid vehicles. After a few months, once you receive the PG&E rebate, you can pay some of the loan costs down with the proceeds.

What about leasing? There are some compelling lease offers available for new EVs. With a lease, the financing entity takes the tax credit and lowers your lease payment. With a lease, your income eligibility for the tax credit is not taken into account. Typically, your monthly lease payment will be based on several factors: your credit score, how much of a down payment at purchase time, how many miles you think you'll drive each year, if you are planning on purchasing or returning at the end of the lease, and the number of years (typically 3 years). With the tax credits going away, car dealers are motivated to reduce pricing and negotiate. Leasing an EV is a good way to try out a vehicle at a lower cost than purchasing, though after three years, you’ll return it with no equity.

Some incentives are sticking around

The PG&E Used EV Rebate of $1,000 with up to $4,000 for income-qualified buyers will still be available after the federal credits expire. Applications must be submitted within 180 days of the date of EV purchase or lease. See income eligibility requirements for the expanded credit. The Sebastopol Library can help with scanning documents needed for the application.

Note that it can take three to six months after purchase to get this rebate check. You need to get proof of registration after purchase before you can submit the paperwork required.

PG&E charger incentives are 50% of the cost of the charger or 100% for income-qualified buyers.

For rural properties, the Federal Inflation Reduction Act 30C Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit has an incentive for chargers and charging infrastructure, which expires in June 2026. The incentive is generally 30% of the property’s cost or $1,000, whichever is less. Some of Sebastopol qualifies as rural. To see if your property qualifies, see the map provided by Argonne National Laboratory..

What about charging?

EV owners typically charge at home. Most cars come with a 110-volt charger, which provides four to five miles per hour of charging, whereas a 220-volt charger gives 20 to 30 miles per hour of charging. If you have a 220-volt clothes dryer, splitter devices are available to charge your vehicle.

For long trips or homes without an accessible charging option, the charging networks are expanding. The Tesla supercharging network is now partially available to non-Tesla vehicles.

EVs vary in charging speed and compatibility.

Try to keep most of your charging times to sunnier times of the day to take advantage of when solar power is available on the grid or from your own solar panels..

Buying and driving your first EV can be a rewarding experience. If you are considering an EV purchase, now is the time to make the leap to cleaner transportation while the federal incentives last, and then you too can love your version of “LeafyLou.”

A number of energy tax credits that are currently available will be eliminated in 2025, some as early as September 30, 2025.

Recent changes under the One Big Beautiful Bill signed into law on July 4, 2025, as Public Law 119-21, significantly change or phase out certain energy tax credits. Acting now could help you lock in valuable savings and lower your tax liability before these credits are no longer available.

What are energy tax credits?

Energy tax credits are incentives offered by the federal government to help you lower your tax liability when investing in renewable energy and energy-efficient technologies. By claiming these credits on your income tax returns, you can reduce your tax liability while making upgrades that save both energy and money. Examples include installing insulated windows or solar panels or purchasing an electric vehicle.

Which energy tax credits end in 2025?

Under the Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law in August 2022, several energy tax credits were extended through 2032, offering long-term benefits for energy-saving investments. Recent changes under the One Big Beautiful Bill, enacted in July 2025, have altered the energy tax credits by accelerating the expiration of certain credits, shortening the window to claim them.

Below are examples of common energy credits that are expiring.

Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit

As a homeowner, you can reduce your tax liability under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 25C by making improvements that reduce the energy usage in your home, such as upgrading exterior windows and skylights, insultation, and air sealing materials or HVAC systems. You may be able to claim a credit up to $3,200. To qualify, these improvements must be completed by December 31, 2025.

Residential Clean Energy Credit

This credit falls under the IRC Section 25D, which allows you to claim a 30% tax credit on qualified installation costs of renewable energy systems, such as solar panels or battery storage that generate clean power for your residence. To qualify, these systems must be fully installed and placed in service by December 31, 2025.

Clean Vehicle Credit

This credit is available for the purchase of a new or used electric vehicle under IRC Section 30D and 25E. You may claim up to $7,500 for a qualifying new electric vehicle or up to $4,000 for a used electric vehicle. To receive this credit, your purchase of an electric vehicle must be made by September 30, 2025.

Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit

This tax credit is available to businesses under Section 45W, for the purchase of electric or fuel-cell vehicles that are used exclusively for commercial purposes. The deadline to purchase the vehicle in order to qualify for the credit is December 31, 2025.

Am I eligible for energy tax credits?

Your eligibility depends on several factors, including the type of property you own, the specific improvements or equipment you install, and in some cases, whether the expenses are personal or business-related. Knowing these details ahead of time makes it easier to see which credit you qualify for and helps you to take full advantage of the savings available.

Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit (IRC Section 25C)

To qualify for the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit, you must be a US citizen or resident alien who owns and uses a home located in the US as your primary or secondary residence. Renters and owners of properties used for businesses are not eligible for this credit. The amount of credit is limited to the amount of tax owed.

Residential Clean Energy Credit (IRC Section 25D)

To qualify for the Residential Clean Energy Credit, you must be a US citizen or resident who installed qualifying renewable energy systems to your property located in the US. Eligible homes include:

Your main home, whether you own it or rent it out, or

A second US home you use part-time and do not rent out.

For mixed-use homes, you can claim a full credit if the business use is 20% or less. If your business use is more than 20%, the credit is limited to the portion of expenses allocable to the non-business use portion.

Clean Vehicle Credit (IRC Sections 30 D & 25 E)

You may be eligible for Clean Vehicle Credit if you purchased a plug-in electric or fuel cell vehicle. For used vehicles, it must be at least two years old, have a sale price of $25,000 or less, and be purchased from a licensed dealer. For new vehicles, it must have a capacity of at least 7 kwh, final assembly in North America, and have a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of $55,000 or less for cars and $80,000 or less for vans, sport utility vehicles (SUVs), and pickup trucks.

Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit (IRC Section 45W)

To qualify for a Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicle credit, you must have purchased a qualified commercial clean vehicle for 100% business use, and you must own a business or tax-exempt organization. For businesses, the credit is nonrefundable; therefore, the amount of credit cannot exceed the amount of tax you owe.

How do I claim the credit?

In most cases, you would claim the credit on your 2025 individual or business tax return.

In some cases, you can obtain an advance on the credit at the time you purchase a qualifying vehicle or make a qualifying purchase. In these cases, the advance on the credit reduces the amount you pay upfront, and then you must report the advance on your 2025 tax return. Your tax return will then reconcile the amount of the advance with the final amount of the credit and include the difference on your tax return.",https://thewolfgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pexels-expect-best-79873-323780-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 03:00:23.201373

The massive US buildout of terminals that process and ship liquefied natural gas, or LNG, has transformed the nation into the world’s top exporter of the fuel. But plants still in development are facing a tight deadline: By 2027, global LNG supply will exceed demand, BloombergNEF estimates. By 2030, US rival Qatar will have finished its own years-long LNG buildout, further damping appetite for new terminals. And by 2031, a massive pipeline expansion by Gazprom PJSC could begin funneling more of Russia’s natural gas to China, possibly displacing as much as 40 million metric tons of LNG demand per year, according to BloombergNEF.

Four US projects with the capacity to export 63 million tons of LNG a year are still awaiting final investment decisions. Even the $35 billion in US plants already under construction face headwinds amid a tight labor market that’s threatening to push back timelines. Golden Pass LNG, being jointly developed in Texas by Exxon Mobil Corp. and QatarEnergy LNG, is coming online in 2025, one year later than scheduled following a worker shortage and the bankruptcy of one of its contractors.

Here are the projects to watch.

Louisiana LNG (Under construction)

Developer: Woodside Energy

Capacity: 27.6 million tons per year

Woodside Energy announced its $17.5 billion final investment decision to build Louisiana LNG in late April, after the company acquired Tellurian Inc. in 2024. The facility is under construction in Calcasieu Pass, Louisiana, and targeted to come online by 2029.

Corpus Christi LNG Expansion (Under construction)

Developer: Cheniere Energy Inc.

Capacity: 3 million tons per year

Cheniere Energy Inc., the largest American exporter, last month announced a $2.9 billion expansion of its Corpus Christi plant in south Texas. Two new production trains are slated to start toward the end of the decade, which would boost total Corpus Christi capacity to 30 million tons a year, including efficiency gains.

CP2 LNG (Under construction)

Developer: Venture Global

Capacity: 28 million tons a year

Venture Global’s $15.1 billion CP2 project in Louisiana is its third export facility, due to start in 2027. Although a permitting pause imposed by President Joe Biden delayed the project last year, President Donald Trump lifted the moratorium soon after starting his term.

Rio Grande LNG Expansion (Awaiting final decision)

Developer: NextDecade Corp.

Capacity: 24 million tons a year

NextDecade Corp., which is currently constructing the first 18 million-ton-a-year phase of Rio Grande LNG in south Texas, is looking to secure funding for its two next trains, which would together add 12 million tons of capacity per year. The company’s deal with contractor Bechtel to build the expansion trains is slated to expire in September, by which time NextDecade expects to commit to the funding. More trains are also in development, but in the permitting phase.

Why the BMW iX3 deserves your attention right now

This is not a concept locked behind velvet ropes it is the BMW iX3, the first Neue Klasse production model. It arrives at a moment when buyers are demanding more from electric vehicles than ever before. Long range, fast charging, and genuine usability are no longer luxuries; they are table stakes. Add in sustainability, smarter software, and a touch of wit, and BMW appears to have built an EV that feels both futuristic and familiar.

The timing could not be sharper. Government policies are tightening around emissions. Consumers are weighing EV purchases against charging infrastructure concerns. Competitors are sprinting to fill every possible niche. The iX3 lands as BMW’s declaration that it is not only in the EV race, but intends to lead it.

Why does this car matter right now?

BMW has spent years hinting at its Neue Klasse platform. Now the first real proof is here. The iX3 delivers an estimated 497 miles of range on the European test cycle. Translated for American roads, that’s a realistic 320 to 380 miles, enough for most drivers to go days without a charge. Dual motors produce 470 horsepower and 475 pound-feet of torque, launching the SUV from zero to sixty in under five seconds. It is quick enough to thrill enthusiasts yet refined enough for daily school runs.

Charging is equally compelling. A 10-to-80 percent DC fast charge takes just 21 minutes. With only 10 minutes plugged in, the iX3 can add about 217 miles of range. For those who dread wasting time at a charger, that is the difference between frustration and convenience. And unlike most rivals, the iX3 does not only take power, it gives it back. Bidirectional charging means it can power a home during an outage, support a laptop on the roadside, or keep the blender running at a campsite. This feature elevates the iX3 beyond transportation, turning it into a mobile energy source.

Inside, BMW has leaned into innovation without abandoning common sense. A 43-inch heads-up projection stretches across the windshield, serving speed, navigation, and alerts directly into the driver’s view. Below that, a 17.9-inch display is angled toward the driver. Yet unlike many competitors, BMW has not sacrificed tactile controls. Real buttons for climate, a physical volume roller, and switches that can be found by feel make the cabin usable without constant screen tapping. In an industry obsessed with minimalism, this combination feels refreshing.

How does it compare to rivals?

The iX3 enters a crowded premium EV market that includes the Tesla Model Y, Audi Q8 e-tron, and Mercedes EQE SUV. Tesla leads on software ecosystem and brand familiarity, but the BMW outpaces it in cabin design and material sustainability. Audi’s Q8 e-tron offers refined comfort but cannot match the iX3’s charging speed or bidirectional capability. Mercedes delivers luxury, yet its reliance on screens without physical controls can feel less intuitive.

Where BMW pulls ahead is in balance. The iX3 does not overwhelm with gimmicks. Its performance is competitive, its range practical, and its tech genuinely useful. A driver who has grown weary of learning new infotainment quirks may appreciate that BMW still values tactile interaction. Meanwhile, its projected range edges out most rivals in real-world comparisons, a point that matters more to American buyers than headline acceleration numbers.

Who is this for and who should skip it?

The iX3 is tailored for buyers who want an EV that feels like a natural upgrade rather than a radical leap. Families will appreciate the 62 cubic feet of cargo space and the 58-liter frunk, big enough for groceries or weekend bags. The 4,400-pound tow rating covers trailers, boats, or even a horse box. Daily commuters will enjoy the seamless integration of safety features: adaptive cruise control, lane keeping, and traffic light recognition. Long trips are made easier by range confidence and fast charging.

This SUV also suits environmentally conscious buyers. Nearly one-third of its materials are recycled. Seat fabrics are spun from PET plastic bottles, mats are crafted from salvaged fishing nets, and the aluminum used in construction is 80 percent reused. It is a clear statement that sustainability need not look or feel compromised.

Who should skip it? Drivers looking for the cheapest way into EV ownership will not find it here. The iX3 is a premium vehicle with premium pricing. Those who demand the absolute longest range in the industry may still gravitate toward Tesla’s upper-end models. And buyers uninterested in technology might find the dual-screen cabin excessive. For the majority, though, the iX3 strikes an enviable balance.

What is the long-term significance?

BMW calls the electronic control unit of the iX3 the “Heart of Joy.” It governs power delivery, regenerative braking, and steering inputs at speeds ten times faster than previous generations. The result is silky acceleration and braking so refined it feels almost apologetic. This is more than marketing; it is a glimpse at how BMW intends to differentiate its driving experience in the electric era.

Safety technology is equally forward-looking. The iX3 reads road signs, interprets driver behavior, and provides support without the heavy-handedness of some systems. It handles roundabouts, lane changes, and traffic signals with minimal fuss. Unlike many voice assistants, BMW’s new AI-driven system responds naturally and learns habits over time. It knows when to warm the seat or suggest a charging stop, without demanding constant prompts.

In the broader industry, the iX3 establishes Neue Klasse as BMW’s future backbone. Every upcoming model will draw from its template of high-range efficiency, rapid charging, sustainable materials, and intuitive software. For consumers, this means BMW’s EVs are no longer niche experiments but mainstream flagships.

The cultural impact should not be overlooked either. By designing an EV that balances NASA-like tech with familiar BMW touches, the company demonstrates that electric vehicles need not alienate long-time petrol drivers. Instead, they can feel aspirational and approachable at once. If competitors chase the same equilibrium, the EV transition may accelerate faster than predicted.

The figure appears in the final report of a public consultation conducted by Cenagas in June and July.

Of the total requirement, distributors are seeking 3.2Bcf of storage capacity in central and northern Mexico.

Mexico currently lacks major natural gas storage infrastructure.

According to the report, published in August, three companies have expressed interest in providing storage services for distributors.

Cenagas said natural gas storage infrastructure would increase Mexico's energy security.

Created by the 2014 energy reform, Cenagas administers Mexico’s main gas pipeline system, previously operated by national oil company Pemex.

The 10,400km Sistrangas network, operated by Cenagas, transports about 60% of the natural gas consumed in Mexico. State-owned utility CFE has sponsored the development of other pipelines to supply its power plants.

Studies

Cenagas is analyzing the feasibility of building underground gas storage facilities at depleted oil fields.

The agency’s 2025 budget includes 25mn pesos (US$1.5mn) for consulting services related to the Jaf field and 10mn pesos for research into potential storage at other depleted fields.

Mexico currently sources around 70% of its natural gas from the US. In the winter of 2021, a severe storm in Texas caused major supply disruptions to Mexico.

In addition to bolstering energy security, storage can help balance supply and demand.

In June 2024, Cenagas suspended a consultation process on the use of the Jaf field in Veracruz state to provide 10Bcf of capacity.

Preliminary tender documents envisioned a facility capable of delivering 500 million cubic feet per day (Mcf/d) of gas for at least five consecutive days.

Meanwhile, the government of the northern state of Tamaulipas has proposed the use of the Brasil field as a storage site.

Strategic partnership with Snow Lake through a 9.9% investment that provides board representation and potential for future collaboration on adjacent properties, offering enhanced scale and capital access without restricting operational flexibility

Near-term growth strategy focuses on expanding the Lo Herma resource beyond 10 million pounds through continued exploration, followed by infill drilling and updated scoping studies to demonstrate economic viability

Market positioning benefits from anticipated uranium supply shortages in the US market, where domestic production remains below 1 million pounds annually while demand increases from AI data centers, electrification, and nuclear plant restarts

Clear value catalysts include resource expansion, uranium price appreciation, and potential consolidation opportunities with established ISR producers like UR Energy or Encore Energy who could validate the project's technical and commercial viability

American Uranium Limited (ASX:AMU), formerly known as GTI Energy Ltd, has strategically positioned itself at the forefront of America's uranium supply revival. In an interview, CEO Bruce Lane outlined the company's evolution from an exploration entity to a development-focused organization with clear commercial objectives. The timing appears opportune, as the US grapples with acute uranium supply shortages while demand surges from multiple sectors including AI-driven data centers, electrification initiatives, and nuclear power plant restarts.

The company's recent name change from its previous identifier reflects a deliberate strategic shift toward clarity and focus.

""American Uranium says more about the company than our previous name. Our old name was a little bit confusing... we wanted to make sure that people really understood what our focus was.""

This rebranding coincides with the company's participation in the World Nuclear Association symposium, where industry sentiment remains notably positive despite ongoing challenges. The event has drawn the full cross-section of the nuclear industry, from mining companies through to power plant developers and the finance community, all focused on execution and delivery rather than conceptual discussions.

The Lo Herma Project: Foundation Asset with Proven Potential

American Uranium's flagship Lo Herma project in Wyoming represents the cornerstone of the company's development strategy. The project has evolved from initial historical data analysis to a substantial resource base of 8.57 million pounds of uranium, with 32% classified as indicated resources. This progression demonstrates the company's methodical approach to resource development and technical validation.

Lane emphasized the project's technical credentials:

""We've located mine units. We've located a central processing plant. We've evaluated the infrastructure. We've got a flowsheet, we've done enough metallurgical testing, and we've got enough understanding of the water to be able to do that interim study.""

The comprehensive nature of this technical work provides confidence in the project's commercial viability and positions it favourably for future development decisions.

Snow Lake Partnership: Strategic Capital and Operational Synergies

The recent partnership with Snow Lake Resources represents a sophisticated approach to capital raising and project development. Through a 9.9% investment in American Uranium, Snow Lake gains board representation while providing capital for continued development activities. This structure offers several strategic advantages without compromising operational independence.

""This was very simple for us. It doesn't offer control of the company.""

The deal's logic extends beyond capital provision, as Snow Lake already maintains an existing joint venture on property immediately adjacent to American Uranium's holdings. ""The geology runs into our property. We're actually pushing our exploration north towards their boundary this summer.""

The partnership timeline reveals careful due diligence and strategic timing.

""We probably started talking informally maybe a year ago was the first contact, but it kind of came to a head at the point where we decided to raise some money.""

Interview with Bruce Lane, CEO of American Uranium

Growth Strategy: Scale as the Primary Value Driver

American Uranium's immediate strategic focus centers on expanding the Lo Herma project to achieve what Lane terms ""minimum efficient scale."" The company targets resource expansion beyond 10 million pounds through systematic exploration activities.

""Making the project bigger is probably the shortest, most logical route.""

Lane emphasized that larger projects present more attractive propositions for capital attraction. The exploration strategy leverages proven geological understanding and established mineralization patterns.

""We believe it's actually economic at the scale that it's at, but obviously to attract the capital, a larger project's a much more attractive proposition.""

This approach balances technical confidence with commercial realities, recognising that scale drives investment attractiveness in the current market environment.

The company's technical approach demonstrates methodical progression from initial resource definition through to development-ready status. Current plans include continued exploration to expand resources, followed by infill drilling to increase confidence levels and support updated scoping studies that could justify progression to feasibility-level analysis.

Market Dynamics: Supply Shortages Drive Opportunity

The broader uranium market context provides strong fundamental support for American Uranium's development strategy. Current US uranium production remains substantially below historical levels and far short of domestic demand requirements.

""We're still producing at a run rate of say less than a million pounds a year. So we're only really just starting to get going.""

Multiple factors contribute to this supply shortage, including the time required for existing producers to reach full operational capacity. Major US producers including UR Energy, Encore Energy, and UEC are still ramping production activities after extended operational shutdowns. ""The ISR producers in the US are only just getting back into business,"" Lane noted, emphasizing the industry-wide nature of the restart challenges.

Demand drivers continue strengthening, particularly from technology sector requirements. The proliferation of AI data centers and broader electrification initiatives creates sustained electricity demand growth, while nuclear power benefits from its firm power characteristics.

""Clearly the forecast for electricity demand is driving the need to find every kind of energy source and nuclear's in the frame.""

Technical Advantages: Proven ISR Methodology in Established Terrain

American Uranium's technical approach leverages in-situ recovery (ISR) methodology, which offers several advantages over conventional mining techniques in suitable geological environments. The Lo Herma project's location within proven uranium-producing geology provides additional confidence in technical execution capabilities.

Lane addressed industry concerns about ISR technical challenges by emphasizing geological understanding and established best practices.

""When it comes down to geological discontinuity and depositional challenges, the projects in Wyoming around us... it's produced more pounds than any other project in Wyoming, and we're in that geology.""

This geological continuity suggests reduced technical risk compared to projects in less established areas.

The company's technical team brings decades of Wyoming operational experience, with four seasons of drilling and exploration activities at Lo Herma providing detailed geological understanding.

""We get a very good feel for how to execute the exploration and how to get the best value out of an investment.""

Valuation Framework: Pounds in Ground vs. Production Reality

American Uranium operates within a unique valuation framework where uranium resources command premiums despite industry emphasis on production capabilities. Lane acknowledged this market dynamic while emphasising the importance of economic demonstration.

Discovery costs provide important context for current valuations. The company estimates brownfield discovery costs at approximately $1 per pound under favourable conditions, compared to historical transaction values of $5-6 per pound during previous uranium price peaks. ""There's a mismatch at the moment,"" Lane observed, suggesting potential valuation adjustments as market conditions evolve.

The economic framework considers broader industry dynamics, including incentive pricing requirements for new production. Lane referenced industry estimates suggesting incentive prices around $95-105 per pound for greenfield development, highlighting the substantial premium required to stimulate new supply additions.

Consolidation Potential: Industry Validation Through Partnership

The uranium sector's fragmented structure creates opportunities for consolidation, particularly among projects with complementary technical characteristics or geographical proximity. American Uranium's strategic positioning makes it an attractive partner for established producers seeking to expand their resource base or extend mine life.

Lane explicitly acknowledged interest from established producers, noting the validation that such partnerships would provide. Such validation could significantly enhance market perception and development prospects.

The consolidation thesis extends beyond simple scale benefits to include technical expertise transfer and operational synergies. Established ISR producers possess the technical knowledge and operational infrastructure necessary to efficiently develop additional projects, potentially accelerating development timelines and reducing execution risks.

The Investment Thesis for American Uranium

Strategic asset positioning in Wyoming's proven uranium-producing region with 8.57 million pounds of resources and established ISR technical methodology

Supply-demand fundamentals support long-term pricing with US production below 1 million pounds annually while demand increases from AI data centers and nuclear plant restarts

Clear value catalysts through resource expansion targeting 10+ million pounds, updated scoping studies, and potential consolidation with established producers

Capital efficiency demonstrated through Snow Lake partnership structure providing funding and strategic relationships without operational constraints

Technical validation from geological continuity with highest-producing Wyoming uranium mines and experienced local operational team

Market timing advantages as established ISR producers require additional resources to fulfill long-term utility contracts and maintain operational capacity

Government policy support through reshoring initiatives, strategic uranium reserve programs, and Defense Production Act provisions favoring domestic supply development

The American uranium sector stands at an inflection point where decades of underinvestment converge with surging demand from multiple sources. The combination of AI-driven data center expansion, broader electrification initiatives, and nuclear power plant restarts creates unprecedented electricity demand growth at precisely the moment when uranium supply remains constrained by years of operational shutdowns and limited exploration investment.

Current US uranium production of less than 1 million pounds annually represents a fraction of domestic reactor requirements, while established producers struggle to restart operations efficiently after extended dormancy periods. This supply-demand imbalance occurs against a backdrop of government policy initiatives explicitly favoring domestic uranium supply development through strategic reserve programs and Defense Production Act provisions.

The technical challenges that have plagued some ISR restart efforts highlight the importance of geological understanding and operational experience, factors that favor projects in established producing regions with proven track records. Wyoming's uranium-producing areas benefit from decades of operational knowledge and established infrastructure, providing technical advantages over projects in less proven territories. As Lane observed,

""We're at a bit of an inflection point in the industry where the supply side, the tightness in supply is starting to come home to roost... there's a confluence of events that I think must show up in the price of uranium for a domestic uranium pound in the US.""

TL;DR

American Uranium Limited (formerly GTI Energy) has strategically rebranded and positioned itself in the US uranium supply revival. The company's flagship Lo Herma project in Wyoming contains 8.57 million pounds of uranium resources and targets expansion beyond 10 million pounds. A strategic partnership with Snow Lake provides capital and board representation through a 9.9% investment while maintaining operational independence. The investment thesis centers on severe US uranium supply shortages (production below 1 million pounds annually) meeting surging demand from AI data centers, electrification, and nuclear plant restarts. Key value catalysts include resource expansion, potential consolidation with established ISR producers, and government policy support for domestic uranium development. The company benefits from proven ISR methodology in Wyoming's established uranium-producing geology with experienced operational teams.

FAQ's (AI-Generated)

Q: What is in-situ recovery (ISR) and why does American Uranium use this method?

A: In-situ recovery is a uranium extraction method that dissolves uranium from underground ore deposits using injection wells, then pumps the uranium-bearing solution to the surface for processing. American Uranium uses ISR because it offers significant advantages over conventional mining in suitable geological environments - it's less environmentally disruptive, requires lower capital investment, and can be more cost-effective. The Lo Herma project is located in Wyoming's proven uranium-producing geology where ISR has been successfully used for decades.

Q: How does the Snow Lake partnership benefit American Uranium without giving up control?

A: Snow Lake's 9.9% investment provides American Uranium with development capital and board representation while staying below the 10% threshold that would trigger control concerns. The partnership offers strategic advantages beyond just funding - Snow Lake has adjacent properties where ""the geology runs into our property,"" creating potential for future collaboration and expanded scale. The deal structure maintains American Uranium's operational independence while providing access to additional capital and strategic relationships.

Q: Why is American Uranium targeting 10+ million pounds of uranium resources?

A: CEO Bruce Lane emphasizes that ""minimum efficient scale"" is crucial for attracting development capital and making projects economically viable. While the current 8.57 million pound resource base may be economic, larger projects are ""much more attractive propositions"" for investors and potential partners. Scale also makes the company more attractive for consolidation opportunities with established ISR producers who need additional resources to fulfill long-term utility contracts.

Q: What's driving the uranium supply shortage and increased demand in the US?

A: The US currently produces less than 1 million pounds of uranium annually - far below domestic reactor requirements. This shortage stems from years of operational shutdowns and underinvestment, with existing producers still struggling to restart operations efficiently. Meanwhile, demand is surging from multiple sources: AI-driven data centers requiring massive electricity, broader electrification initiatives, and nuclear power plant restarts. The combination creates unprecedented demand growth precisely when supply remains severely constrained.",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64523461a75e4b406281bdba/68b9df18d83feab1b4314d9d_aaron-burden-9C8r4QUwZRQ-unsplash%20(1).jpg,N,,2025-09-05 22:02:23.025882

The environment is about to become a flashpoint in Oregon in a way it hasn’t been in decades.","If Oregon has a “brand,” protection of its environment has to be integral to it. Probably no political figure in the state’s history more represents it to the rest of the world than former Republican Gov. Tom McCall, the champion of pioneering Oregon laws that kept beaches publicly owned, charged deposits on bottles and cans to reduce litter and blocked cities from sprawling.

More than for anything else, McCall is known for his crusades — not always perfect but often effective — to protect the natural condition of the state. While other western states, including Idaho and Wyoming, have been the scene of hard-fought contests over preservation against development and use, Oregon for generations has weighed in clearly on the environmental preservation side.

The Trump administration has begun weighing in on the other side, and Oregon likely will be putting a lot of civic effort into maintaining its course. While some efforts from the national capital — such as Utah Sen. Mike Lee’s call for mass selloff of federal lands — have hit speed bumps, others are underway.

The argument in favor of that new direction, implicit or explicit, will involve expansion of resource industries and the jobs that have been attached to them. Forest industries were for generations the bedrock of the Oregon economy, supplying much of its wealth and many of its jobs.

It is a smaller component today. The state’s forest sector today takes in about 62,000 direct jobs, a large number but just about 3% of jobs overall. The economic impact of wood products now is less than that: By one recent estimate, the subcategory of “logging” — as opposed to manufacturing wood products, work in nurseries and associated work — accounts for 5,736 jobs.

The number of Oregon mill jobs fell by about 500 over the last year, and one reason given for that was a lack of timber supply. But specific types of timber would be needed to supply the more specialized mills of today: Not just any stock would do. Even if more forests were opened to cutting, the number couldn’t increase dramatically soon, because a large economic infrastructure would have to be built up to support it. And even if those problems could be solved, the weak demand for timber and in recent years difficulties finding an adequate work force would remain as major obstacles.

Whatever the rationale, the pressure against preservation from the nation’s capital is clear and accelerating.

The most dramatic recent instance is the Trump administration’s published intent to scale back — exactly how much is unclear — the roadless rule from 2001 affecting vast stretches of forested land in backcountry areas nationwide, including in Oregon. The Sierra Club said the change “threatens nearly 58 million acres of undeveloped backcountry forestland, jeopardizing crucial drinking water sources for communities across the nation”

That includes 2 million acres of land now protected from development in Oregon — a big chunk of the 14.5 million acres in the 11 national forests in the state, and some of the most prized recreational areas.

That follows up on a pair of presidential executive orders earlier this year aimed at increasing timber production on national lands and bypassing rules that protect critical wildlife habitat.

There’s much more from the White House affecting the Northwest specifically, such as the abrupt reversal of a long-negotiated deal — the Resilient Columbia Basin Agreement — to restore salmon runs along the Snake River.

More narrowly, the Friends of the Columbia Gorge said last month that “The Trump administration’s FY26 budget proposes redirecting roughly $387 million from the Land and Water Conservation Fund’s (LWCF) federal land acquisition budget to fund “deferred maintenance” — that is, repairs to trails, visitor centers, and infrastructure, in addition to logging — directly contradicting the Great American Outdoors Act (GAOA) that President Trump himself signed into law in 2020.”

Taken together, this along with still more examples amounts to a massive reversal of national policy developed over decades and in some cases even in the first Trump Administration. It’s easy to lose track of the larger developing picture amid the wash of daily news.

Resistance to it in the Northwest is just beginning to develop. But it will emerge visibly soon.

In addition to a supportive political environment, Oregon has an especially large number of environmental action groups (owing in part to the large and often influential Friends network) but much of their activity — the Oregon Environmental Council is a good example — has been focused on state government activity, where reception to their efforts has been relatively (albeit not always) positive.

Expect the focus to change to the national level, alliances to shift, and legal and political conflict to ramp upward, in the next few months if not weeks.

As the AI energy debate heats up, local leaders could be in for some challenging choices.","To lead the world in the AI race, President Donald Trump says the U.S. will need to ""triple"" the amount of electricity it produces. At a cabinet meeting on Aug. 26, he made it clear his administration's policy is to favor fossil fuels and nuclear energy, while dismissing solar and wind power.

“Windmills, we’re just not going to allow them. They ruin our country,” Trump said at the meeting. “They’re ugly, they don’t work, they kill your birds, they’re bad for the environment.""

He added that he also didn’t like solar because of the space it takes up on land that could be used for farming.

“Whether we like it or not, fossil fuel is the thing that works,” said Trump. “We’re going to fire up those big monster factories.”

In the same meeting, he showcased a photo of what he said was a $50 billion mega data center planned for Louisiana, provided by Mark Zuckerberg.

Watch a condensed version of Trump’s comments at the cabinet meeting in the video below.

But there's a reason coal-fired power plants have been closing at a rapid pace for years: cost. According to the think tank Energy Innovation, coal power in the U.S. tends to cost more to run than renewables. Before Trump's second term, the U.S. Department of Energy publicized a strategy to support new energy demand for AI with renewable sources, writing that ""solar energy, land-based wind energy, battery storage and energy efficiency are some of the most rapidly scalable and cost competitive ways to meet increased electricity demand from data centers.""

Further, many governments examining how to use AI also have climate pledges in place to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions — including states such as North Carolina and California.

Earlier this year Trump passed an executive order, “Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry and Amending Executive Order 14241,” directing the secretaries of the Interior, Commerce and Energy to identify regions where coal-powered infrastructure is available and suitable for supporting AI.

A separate executive order, “Accelerating Federal Permitting of Data Center Infrastructure,” shifts the power to the federal government to ensure that new AI infrastructure, fueled by specific energy sources, is built quickly by “easing federal regulatory burdens.”

In an interview with Government Technology, a representative of Core Natural Resources, a U.S.-based mining and mineral resource company, explained this federal shift will be a “resurgency for the industry,” pressing that coal is “uniquely positioned” to fill the energy need AI will create.""

“If you’re looking to generate large amounts of energy that these data centers are going to require, you need to focus on energy sources that are going to be able to meet that demand without sacrificing the power prices for the consumers,” said Matthew Mackowiak, director of government affairs at Core.

“It's going to be what powers the future, especially when you look at this demand growth over the next few years,” said Mackowiak.

Yet these plans for the future, including increased reliance on fossil fuels and coal, as well as needing mega data centers, may not be what the public is willing to accept. According to the International Energy Agency, a typical AI-focused data center consumes as much electricity as 100,000 households, but larger ones currently under construction may consume 20 times as much.

A recent report from Data Center Watch suggests that local activism is threatening to derail a potential data center boom.

According to the research firm, $18 billion worth of data center projects have been blocked, while $46 billion of projects were delayed over the last two years in situations where there was opposition from residents and activist groups. Common arguments against the centers are higher utility bills, water consumption, noise, impact on property value and green space preservation.

The movement may put state and local governments in the middle of a clash between federal directives and backlash from their communities. Last month in Tucson, Ariz., City Council members voted against a proposed data center project, due in large part to public pressure from residents with fears about its water usage.

St. Charles, Mo., recently considered banning proposed data centers for one year, pausing the acceptance of any zoning change applications for data centers or the issuing of any building permits for data centers following a wave of opposition from residents.

This debate may hit a fever pitch as many state and local governments are also piloting or launching their own programs powered by AI, from traffic management systems to new citizen portals.

As the AI energy debate heats up, local leaders could be in for some challenging choices. As Mackowiak of Core Natural Resources noted, officials have a ""tough job, listening to constituents and trying to do what's best."" He asserted that officials should consider ""resource adequacy,” adding that ""access to affordable, reliable, dependable power is first and foremost when it comes to a healthy economy and national security.""

The ultimate question for government leaders is not just whether they can meet the energy demands of a private data center, but how the public's perception of this new energy future will affect their own technology goals. If the citizens begin to associate AI with contentious projects and controversial energy sources, it could create a ripple effect of distrust, disrupting the potential of the technology regardless of the benefits.

Tesla said in a regulatory filing Friday that it will hand Musk shares worth as much as 12% of the company in a dozen separate packages if the company meets certain performance targets, including massive increases in car production, share price and operating profit. If approved by shareholders, the new pay package could make Musk the world’s first trillion dollar executive, and would mark a new level of outsized pay in a country already known for extreme compensation. But the payoff is in shares, not cash, and the goals are extreme as well.

Musk overcame doubters to turn Tesla into the world’s most valuable car company, but he could face even steeper odds in hitting the targets set by the company’s compensation committee — not least because of Tesla’s main business of making electric vehicles is currently in a slump, in part because of Musk’s foray into right-wing politics.

“It doesn’t matter how much money he gets. He can’t help himself,” said Telemetry analyst Sam Abuelsamid who follows Tesla stock, which is down 25% this year. “And the more he talks, the more he turns off potential customers.”

To get his first package of shares equivalent to 1% of the company, Musk would have to convince investors in the stock market that Tesla is worth $2 trillion in total, double what they value it today, and also hit several other milestones. To receive all the shares offered and make him the world’s first trillion-dollar man would require that market value to then rise to $8.5 trillion, double that of the world’s most valuable company now, chipmaker Nvidia.

Among other goals, sales of all Tesla vehicles would eventually also have to reach 20 million, nearly triple its entire sales since it was founded more than two decades ago. Musk would also have to vastly expand Tesla’s robot and robotaxi businesses by selling a million of the bots and a million of the driverless cabs, the latter a business that has only begun to roll out its taxi service and is behind rivals, such as Waymo.

Musk would also need to remain with Tesla for at least seven and a half years to cash out on any stock, and 10 years to earn the full amount.

Musk has been one of the richest people in the world for several years.

Musk would also receive more voting power over Tesla under the proposed plan. The EV company is set to hold its annual shareholders meeting on Nov. 6, where investors will vote on the new pay package. Tesla’s last shareholders meeting was on June 13 of last year, where investors to restore Musk’s record $44.9 billion pay package that was thrown out by a Delaware judge earlier that year. Late last year the revoked the package for a second time. Tesla has appealed the ruling

A condition of the 11th and 12th tranches of the plan includes Musk coming up with a framework for someone to succeed him as CEO.

The plunge in Tesla sales this year was largely due to blowback over Musk’s affiliation with President Donald Trump. Tesla also faces intensifying competition from the big Detroit automakers and particularly from China.

Tesla sales have fallen precipitously in Europe after Musk aligned with a far-right political party in German.

Sales plunged 40% in July in the 27 European Union countries compared with the year earlier even as sales overall of electric vehicle soared, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association. Meanwhile sales of Chinese rival BYD continued to climb fast, grabbing 1.1% market share of all car sales in the month versus Tesla’s 0.7%.

In its most recent quarter, Tesla reported that quarterly profits plunged from $1.39 billion to $409 million. Revenue also fell and the company came up short of even the lowered expectations on Wall Street.

Investors have grown increasingly worried about the trajectory of the company after Musk had spent so much time in Washington this year, becoming one of the most prominent officials in the Trump administration in its bid to slash the size of the U.S. government.

Last month Tesla said that it gave Musk a stock grant of $29 billion as a reward for years of “transformative and unprecedented” growth despite the drop in sales and profits.

Tesla said at the time that the grant was a “first step, good faith” way of retaining Musk and keeping him focused, citing his leadership of SpaceX, xAI and other companies. Musk said recently that he needed more shares and control so he couldn’t be ousted by shareholder activists.

Sign up for their newsletter here.

Despite a summer in which nearly600 people are suspected to have died in the increasing heat of the changing climate in the nation’s sunniest state, Arizona’s largest utility walked back its clean energy commitments in August.

Nearly two dozen Arizonans gathered outside Arizona Public Services headquarters Thursday to protest that decision—as well as the utility’s recent announcements that it is planning to build a new natural gas pipeline all the way to Texas, is likely extending how long it will operate its largest coal plant and, for the third year in a row, is raising its rates, this time by 14 percent in 2026.

“They’ve totally abandoned their commitment on climate to future generations, and they’ve guaranteed that our bills will be even higher,” Sandy Bahr, the Sierra Club’s Grand Canyon chapter director, said at the protest.

APS’ recent actions come as the federal government, under the Trump administration, has gutted funding for climate and clean energy initiatives, and announced it would repeal science-backed findings that greenhouse gases harm human health and the environment. Instead of supporting the transition to clean energy, the administration is promoting the continued use of fossil fuels, going so far as to block the closure of a coal-fired plant.

Those federal actions have had ripple effects throughout the country’s utilities. Southern Company has extended the lifespans of its coal-fired plants in Mississippi and Georgia. North Carolina’s legislature passed the “The Power Bill Reduction Act,” which will allow Duke Energy to backslide on its legally mandated carbon emissions reductions.

APS, Arizona’s largest utility, is following suit on its own accord.

In a press release announcing the company’s second-quarter financials and its decision to roll back its clean energy commitments, it cited Arizona’s “unprecedented levels” of growth in population and its economy, and the need for reliable utility service to meet the increasing demand.

“Our mission is to reliably serve customers at the lowest cost possible,” Ted Geisler, the chairman, president and chief executive officer of Pinnacle West Capital Corporation, which owns APS, said in the press release. “To do that, we need to integrate the most reliable and cost-effective resources available to us to meet Arizona’s fast-growing energy needs.”

Ann Porter, a spokesperson for APS, said in a statement that the utility is committed to providing reliable power at the lowest costs possible and remains the state’s leader in clean energy. The utility’s current rates have not kept up with the costs it takes to operate a reliable and resilient grid, and APS remains committed to long-term clean energy goals, she added.

“We understand rising costs are impacting so many aspects of customers’ lives today and that it’s never a good time to see bills increase,” Porter said. “That’s why we’re focused on doing our part to keep our costs down, while giving customers tools, programs and options to help them manage their bills. Reliability isn’t optional—it’s essential, especially in Arizona.”

Demand going up

For three consecutive summers, the utility has experienced record-high energy demand. That demand is only expected to go up. By 2038, the company expects a 60 percent increase over today’s peak demand.

That’s largely due to the massive influx of data centers opening in Arizona. The state is already home to approximately 118 data centers, with more in the pipeline, and they are increasingly coming under scrutiny across the state.

Before the August announcement, APS aimed to meet its electricity demand with zero carbon emissions by 2050. Now, it’s settled on just being carbon neutral by that date, meaning it would still release greenhouse gases in the atmosphere but would find ways to offset those emissions.

On the same day it announced its revised carbon emissions goal, APS, along with the City of Mesa, the Salt River Project, Tucson Electric Power and UniSource Energy Services, announced plans to build a new natural gas pipeline from the Permian Basin in West Texas to Arizona by late 2029. Natural gas pipelines are major emitters of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that’s roughly 80 times more effective at warming the atmosphere than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period. APS may also extend the lifespan of its Four Corners coal power plant, from 2031 to no later than 2038, Porter said, despite the company’s own economic data showing it makes more sense to close it down.

This year, Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, signed bills into law that allow utilities to shift financial responsibility for events such as power plant retirement, unrecovered fuel costs, damaging weather events like wildfires and other operational uncertainties onto ratepayers via a monthly, unrestricted charge on their utility bills. Another new law in Arizona shields utilities from liability for wildfires.

“It’s a perfect storm of bad policies happening in Arizona right now,” said Bahr with the Sierra Club.

On top of it all, she added, is that the Arizona Corporation Commission, the state’s elected public utilities regulators, is now completely controlled by Republicans following extensive lobbying by APS. The commission is now seeking to repeal the state’s renewable energy standards.

By walking back its clean energy commitments, extending the life of coal plants and building new gas pipelines, Arizona’s air quality and heat issues will only get worse, Bahr said.

“Extreme heat is our extreme weather here,” she said.

Jose Flores, the Arizona environmental justice coordinator for Poder Latinx, an organizing group, said he’s heard from residents across the Phoenix area about their struggles with extreme heat and rising costs of nearly everything, including their electricity bills.

“What we see is people are hurting, and the utilities, they don’t really care as long as they’re making record profits,” Flores said.",https://media2.phoenixnewtimes.com/phx/imager/protesters-slam-aps-for-raising-rates-ditching-clean-energy/u/r-landingfeature/22611642/aps-protest-2.webp?cb=1757104408,N,,2025-09-05 18:05:16.840222

Justin Chen, president of AFGE Council 238, said in a statement that the firings and suspensions are “an attack on free speech and our ability to protect human health and the environment.”

The union is demanding that the EPA bring back the fired employees and revoke any probationary firings, notices of proposed removal, suspensions, and letters of reprimand.

Chen also said the workers “bravely voiced concerns about harmful changes at the agency that threaten the lives of every American.”

Moreover, “we know the administration’s motives are not about government efficiency or advancing public safety,” Chen said.

“Placing these workers on leave and now firing or suspending them months later has wasted over 47,000 work hours and $2 million,” he said. “This is simply about squashing dissent and preventing workers from protecting American lives.”

The EPA declined to comment, with a spokesperson saying the agency doesn’t disclose information about individual personnel matters.

The August dissent letter, addressed to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, said the agency has ignored scientific consensus to benefit polluters, turned its back on environmental justice communities, and promoted “a culture of fear, forcing staff to choose between their livelihood and well-being.”

The EPA has said it has a zero-tolerance position for employees “using their agency position and title to unlawfully undermine, sabotage, and undercut the will of the American public that was clearly expressed at the ballot box last November.”

The agency has further said the staffers who signed the letter are only a small fraction of the “thousands of hard-working, dedicated EPA employees who are not trying to mislead and scare the American public.”",https://db0ip7zd23b50.cloudfront.net/dims4/default/3e7ce54/2147483647/crop/5104x1967+0+427/resize/960x370%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbloomberg-bna-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3b%2Fe6%2F1268a26d4f7d9cdcf729a18b3b72%2Fepa.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 18:04:50.968692

Introduction: 2025’s Pivotal Mineral Market

In 2025, American copper companies and US lithium mining companies will stand at the heart of a dynamic global surge in critical mineral demand. These resources are increasingly becoming the backbone of the clean energy transition, the burgeoning electric vehicle (EV) domain, and the modernization of infrastructure and defense systems across the United States. This evolution is particularly pronounced in the United States, as it seeks to secure domestic mineral supply chains to reduce reliance on foreign regions—many marked with geopolitical risks.

The rising demand for copper and lithium isn’t just about industrial growth; it reflects a broader transition toward advanced energy systems, sustainable agriculture, electrification of transportation, and resilient national defense. The pulse of the market beats to the rhythm of EV adoption, renewable energy projects, and a federal push to uphold and modernize domestic supply chains.

In this comprehensive guide, we explore the trends, companies, technologies, market performance, and policy directions shaping American copper companies, US lithium mining companies, and lithium mining companies stock outlook into 2025 and beyond.

“American copper mining companies outperformed the S&P 500 by 18% amid rising renewable energy trends in 2024.”

Copper Mining: The Foundation of Green Infrastructure

Copper is more than a basic industrial metal; it is the foundation behind the United States’ green transformation and modernization. Its excellent conductivity, durability, and corrosion resistance make it indispensable for a wide array of applications:

Energy & Infrastructure: Copper wiring is vital in energy storage and renewable systems (solar panels, wind turbines), connecting and upgrading the national grid for reliable clean power access and modernization projects.

Agriculture: Copper is used in equipment, efficient irrigation systems, and electrified farming technology, thereby promoting sustainable water management and agriculture resource optimization.

Defense: Advanced electronic warfare devices, communication systems, and radar infrastructure require copper’s electrical properties and stability.

American copper mining companies are now ramping up production and investing in technological advancements aimed at increasing yield while reducing environmental impacts. These efforts align with federal incentives and policy directions that prioritize domestic production, with a marked emphasis on lessening reliance on vulnerable foreign regions.

Officials at the press conference argued that bills like this only accelerate severe consequences of a warming climate.","ITHACA, N.Y. — Local leaders gathered Thursday morning to critique the wave of federal funding cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and warn about the potential local consequences the cuts could bring.

Among those speaking at the event were Mayor Rob Cantelmo, State Senator Lea Webb, Democratic nominee for Tompkins County Legislature Iris Packman, and food and agriculture advocate Claire Walsh Winsler.

On July 18, the EPA announced staff cuts amounting to 3,707 people who would no longer be working for the agency, either because of voluntary retirements or other reductions. The Trump administration has claimed that the restructuring of the agency will result in hundreds of millions of dollars in federal savings. The full trickle-down effect on local municipalities is not yet clear.

At the press conference Thursday, officials pushed back on this notion, noting that the nearly 25% cut to the agency’s budget has occurred alongside the deregulation of forever chemicals in drinking water and deletion of public health data.

“Let’s be clear, gutting the EPA is a direct attack on public health here in the Southern Tier,” Cantelmo said as he opened up the press conference. “If Washington succeeds in slashing funding and hollowing out staff, our communities are going to be the ones that pay the price.”

The loss of funding from the EPA, officials say, will lead to greater financial and environmental costs for municipalities, costs that will eventually land on taxpayers, Webb said.

“New York stands to lose millions of dollars, and as Mayor Cantelmo said, those costs get passed on to our communities,” Webb said.

Ithaca has benefited from federal projects such as the construction of the retention wall to keep lead from seeping into Ithaca Falls, said Packman.

“Without federal resources and enforcement powers, the state and local governments are left to try to hold polluters accountable and manage cleanup efforts on our own, which is often unsuccessful,” she added.

Walsh Winsler, who spoke on behalf of Environmental Advocates New York, closed the conference by sharing a powerful anecdote about how pollution had affected her family.

Her father, who grew up in the Hudson Valley drinking water from what would later be declared a Superfund site, passed away in 2021 from leukemia, she said, holding back tears. Her grandfather died in 2008 from the same kind of cancer.

“While they were killed by the same cancer, and both drank polluted water for decades, they themselves were not related by blood, making their cancer diagnosis even more suspect and even more heartbreaking,” Walsh Winsler said.

This kind of cancer is linked to volatile organic compounds often present at Superfund sites.

These cuts, officials said, exacerbate the risk of adverse climate change impacts, especially considering previous cuts to flood mitigation grants through FEMA and renewable energy projects across the country.

U.S. Representative Nick Langworthy, from New York’s 23rd district, recently introduced the Energy Choice Act, which counters state and local bans on fossil fuel infrastructure, such as natural gas hookups in new homes, claiming affordability concerns.

Officials at the press conference argued that bills like this only accelerate severe consequences of a warming climate.

“I think maybe the Congressman should spend some time in his own district to look at the communities that have been adversely impacted by climate change,” Cantelmo said.

“Stakeholder support is essential to advance energy projects that expand transmission capacity and introduce new sources of energy, and the WSP Pulse Report sheds light on what matters most to various segments of the American public,” said Mike Case, Power and Energy executive and senior vice president at WSP in the U.S. “Current and future demand is influenced by factors such as AI, increased electrification and a rise in domestic manufacturing. Efforts today will shape energy infrastructure for the next several decades, making it critical to understand how to address concerns and garner support for everything from new transmission projects to energy storage.”

The report shares notable findings such as:

Capacity is capturing attention: Nearly four out of five Americans (78 percent) expressed concern about expanding grid capacity to meet rising power demand, with urbanites (80 percent) more likely than rural residents (73 percent) to have this concern.

Concerned, but confident in local utilities. There is increasing frequency and severity of hurricanes, wildfires and other calamities. The survey found that four in five Americans (80 percent) say they are concerned about the safety of the grid, including vulnerability to extreme weather. Nonetheless, nearly 7 in 10 Americans (69 percent) are confident their local utility is prepared to prevent power outages during natural disasters.

Support for new transmission projects and storage: Most Americans (71 percent) agree that the federal government should speed up permitting for essential electric grid projects even if that reduces local government control. Nearly seven in 10 Americans (69 percent) believe the U.S. government should invest more in batteries for electricity storage to make the electric grid more resilient.

When it comes to electricity, Americans are willing to put community first: An overwhelming majority (92 percent) of Americans say their support of new transmission projects through their community would increase if it helped the U.S. meet the growing demand for power overall, even if it may not benefit them directly. That is the same proportion who say their support for new transmission projects would increase if it lowered their own electricity costs over the long term (94 percent). Most Americans (90 percent) would increase their support for new transmission projects through their community if investing now would help avoid higher costs and delays in the future.

More than three quarters of Americans (77 percent) would like to know more about how to improve the electric grid in their community. WSP also identified a notable group of “energy enthusiasts,” the 28 percent of Americans who strongly agree that they want to know more about the topic, suggesting an opportunity for greater public education and involvement.

“Poll findings will help inform WSP’s approach to supporting our clients’ energy development plans,” Case said. “Together, we can enhance reliability, improve resiliency and address increasing power needs.”

To help move the metal in the meantime automakers are going all out and offering sales incentives at unheard-of levels, with some being in addition to the $7,500 federal incentive, where applicable.

As it now stands the tax credit/rebate can only be claimed by income-qualifying buyers on a relative handful of EVs that meet certain requirements for domestic production and are priced under $50,000 for passenger cars and $80,000 for trucks and SUVs. They can either be taken at the point of sale or applied to next year’s federal tax return. However, be aware that many automakers have managed to exploit a loophole in the tax credit legislation that passes all or part of the $7,500 to those leasing an EV that otherwise doesn’t qualify for the credit.

Those who may be thinking about buying or leasing an electric vehicle are strongly urged to take advantage of what may be the last of the red-hot deals among electrified cars, trucks and SUVs before month’s end. That’s because cash rebates as rich as $20,000 are up for grabs in addition to financing deals as low as 0% (with the latter limited to the most creditworthy consumers). We’re listing all of the available incentives on EVs being offered this month below.

Of note, the IRS recently ruled that even though the EV tax credit expires on September 30th, buyers can still qualify if they enter a binding contract and make a payment before the deadline, even if the car is delivered later.

,North Carolina and Evs,2025-09-05 20:14:14+00:00,WSOC TV,Trillion dollar man: New pay package could make Musk that much richer if Tesla thrives,MICHELLE CHAPMAN and BERNARD CONDON,,,,,https://www.wsoctv.com/news/elon-musk-is-line-1/WZ2EFSQRW5CSJP43AGI7RPVKCY/,"If approved by shareholders, the new pay package could make Musk the world’s first trillion dollar executive, and would mark a new level of outsized pay in a country already known for extreme compensation.
He can’t help himself,” said Telemetry analyst Sam Abuelsamid who follows Tesla stock, which has plummeted 27% from its December high.
The plunge in Tesla sales this year was largely due to blowback over Musk's affiliation with President Donald Trump.
Tesla sales have fallen precipitously in Europe after Musk aligned with a far-right political party in German.
The EV company is set to hold its annual shareholders meeting on Nov. 6, where investors will vote on the new pay package.","The world's richest man could become its first trillionaire if Elon Musk hits a series of extremely aggressive targets for his electric car company over the next decade, according to a proposed pay package released by the company.

Tesla said in a regulatory filing Friday that it will hand Musk shares worth as much as 12% of the company in a dozen separate packages if the company meets certain performance targets, including massive increases in car production, share price and operating profit. If approved by shareholders, the new pay package could make Musk the world’s first trillion dollar executive, and would mark a new level of outsized pay in a country already known for extreme compensation. But the payoff is in shares, not cash, and the goals are extreme as well.

Musk overcame doubters to turn Tesla into the world's most valuable car company, but he could face even steeper odds in hitting the targets set by the company's compensation committee — not least because of Tesla’s main business of making electric vehicles is currently in a slump, in part because of Musk's foray into right-wing politics.

“It doesn’t matter how much money he gets. He can’t help himself,” said Telemetry analyst Sam Abuelsamid who follows Tesla stock, which has plummeted 27% from its December high. “And the more he talks, the more he turns off potential customers.”

To get his first package of shares equivalent to 1% of the company, Musk would have to convince investors in the stock market that Tesla is worth $2 trillion in total, double what they value it today, and also hit several other milestones. To receive all the shares offered and make him the world’s first trillion-dollar man would require that market value to then rise to $8.5 trillion, double that of the world’s most valuable company now, chipmaker Nvidia.

Among other goals, sales of all Tesla vehicles would eventually also have to reach 20 million, nearly triple its entire sales since it was founded more than two decades ago. Musk would also have to vastly expand Tesla's robot and robotaxi businesses by selling a million of the bots and a million of the driverless cabs, the latter a business that has only begun to roll out its taxi service and is behind rivals, such as Waymo.

Musk would also need to remain with Tesla for at least seven and a half years to cash out on any stock, and 10 years to earn the full amount.

Musk has been one of the richest people in the world for several years. He is currently estimated to be worth more than $400 billion by Forbes magazine.

A condition of the 11th and 12th tranches of the plan includes Musk coming up with a framework for someone to succeed him as CEO.

The plunge in Tesla sales this year was largely due to blowback over Musk's affiliation with President Donald Trump. Tesla also faces intensifying competition from the big Detroit automakers and particularly from China.

Tesla sales have fallen precipitously in Europe after Musk aligned with a far-right political party in German. Sales plunged 40% in July in the 27 European Union countries compared with the year earlier even as sales overall of electric vehicle soared, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association. Meanwhile sales of Chinese rival BYD continued to climb fast, grabbing 1.1% market share of all car sales in the month versus Tesla's 0.7%.

Without a reversal of those trends, meeting the financial goals could prove especially difficult. In its most recent quarter, Tesla reported that quarterly profits plunged from $1.39 billion to $409 million. Revenue also fell and the company came up short of even the lowered expectations on Wall Street.

Investors have grown increasingly worried about the trajectory of the company after Musk had spent so much time in Washington this year, becoming one of the most prominent officials in the Trump administration in its bid to slash the size of the U.S. government.

Even bulls on the stock are not convinced the new pay incentive will keep Musk, who frequently posts on his X social media platform, from saying things that alienate potential buyers.

Said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, “Fixing the Musk brand damage remains a work in progress."" Even so, Ives told clients, “We believe this was the smart move by the Board as the biggest asset for Tesla is Musk.”

In January 2024, a Delaware judge threw out Musk's previous pay package, worth $44.9 billion at the time. Investors voted to restore that compensation package at Tesla's last shareholders meeting on June 13 of last year. But late last year the package was revoked for a second time. Tesla has appealed the ruling. Last month, Tesla said that it gave Musk a stock grant of $29 billion as a reward for years of ""transformative and unprecedented"" growth — despite the drop in sales and profits — and noting that the CEO hadn't been paid in years.

The EV company is set to hold its annual shareholders meeting on Nov. 6, where investors will vote on the new pay package. Musk would also receive more voting power over Tesla under the proposed plan. Musk has said that he needed more shares and control so he couldn't be ousted by shareholder activists. If he does hit all the goals, Musk would own about quarter of the company's shares, up from 13% today.

Tesla's stock nearly 3% in afternoon trading.

The Spring Hill facility will also shut down for one week in October and another in November. Beginning in early 2026, one of the plant’s two shifts will be temporarily eliminated, cutting output further. Employees affected by the changes will be placed on layoff status and may qualify for sub-pay and benefits under the National UAW/GM contract.

GM is also delaying the launch of a second shift at a Kansas City–area factory that will build the new Chevy Bolt EV.

In a statement, GM said the changes are “strategic production adjustments in alignment with expected slower EV industry growth and customer demand.”

The move follows the Trump administration’s rollback of EV tax credits and fuel-efficiency penalties, which automakers say will make gas-powered vehicles more attractive to buyers.

Orsted shareholders back $9.4 billion rights issue

Group’s two US projects at risk in Trump’s war on wind power

S&P Global warns equity raise offers limited relief from credit pressures

Orsted’s shares down 85% from 2021 peak

COPENHAGEN, Sept 5 (Reuters) – Danish offshore wind developer Orsted secured shareholder approval on Friday for a $9.4 billion emergency rights issue aimed at staving off a crippling credit downgrade as the Trump administration targets its U.S. projects.

Once celebrated as a trailblazer in offshore wind, the state-controlled group now finds itself in dire straits, grappling with industry-wide challenges and U.S. President Donald Trump’sopposition to wind power.

“(The rights issue) gives us a strong financial foundation that is necessary to deliver on our business plan, manage the uncertainty in the U.S. and ensure that we can contribute to the development of offshore wind in Europe,” Chair Lene Skole told shareholders.

“It’s going to be a long, tough journey to re-erect Orsted,” Skole said.

Adding to its troubles, low wind speeds in July and August and a delay to a project under construction off Taiwan prompted it to cut its 2025 operating profit outlook on Friday.

The stakes are high for the Danish firm, which has transformed itself from oil producer DONG Energy into a global renewables leader with a market value that grew five-fold between its 2016 IPO and a 2021 peak.

But supply chain disruptions, surging interest rates, project delays, and Trump’s anti-wind policies have battered the offshore wind sector, sending Orsted’s shares tumbling by 85% from their peak.

TRUMP’S WAR ON WIND

At the heart of the drama are Orsted’s U.S. projects Sunrise Wind and Revolution Wind, both of which have been thrown into uncertainty.

Two-thirds of the fresh capital it is seeking to raise is earmarked for Sunrise Wind, a project that saw potential co-investors flee after the White House ordered Norway’s Equinor to halt a neighbouring wind farm in April.

U.S. officials also issued a stop-work order for the nearly completed Revolution Wind facility last month, prompting the joint venture running the project to file a lawsuit against the Trump administration over the decision.

The rights issue is critical for Orsted’s survival and its ability to retain its credit rating.

“We do this to ensure that we can continue to lead the expansion of offshore wind in our core markets here in Europe for the critical years to come,” CEO Rasmus Errboe told reporters at a meeting of EU countries’ energy ministers in Copenhagen on Thursday.

Ratings agency S&P Global warned that the equity raise might only buy the company three to six months of relief from construction delays before it faces additional credit pressures.

S&P already downgraded Orsted to BBB- in August, the lowest investment-grade rating. Any further downgrade would push it into junk territory – a label that would impact its ability to finance future projects.

Norwegian state-controlled energy firm Equinor, a 10% shareholder in Orsted, has thrown it a lifeline, pledging to inject up to 6 billion crowns ($941.2 million) into the rights issue.

Equinor CFO Torgrim Reitan described the moment as a crucial juncture.

“We find it important to be a long-term and supportive investor in a period like this,” Reitan said earlier this week, hinting at a deeper strategic collaboration between the two companies.

With ambitious targets to procure 4,000 MW of renewable resources by 2035 and over 1,500 MW of battery storage by the same year, the company is aligning its long-term value creation with the dual imperatives of grid reliability and decarbonization. For investors, this strategic pivot offers a compelling case for sustained growth, supported by regulatory tailwinds, market dynamics, and a robust ESG framework.

A Renewable Energy Roadmap with Clear Milestones

Georgia Power’s IRP, approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission (PSC), outlines a phased approach to expanding its clean energy portfolio. By 2035, the utility aims to add 4,000 MW of renewable resources, including solar, wind, and biomass, while extending the operational life of carbon-free nuclear units at Plants Hatch and Vogtle [1]. The 2025 plan prioritizes 1,100 MW of new renewable capacity through competitive procurements, with solar energy expected to dominate due to its cost-effectiveness and scalability [4]. Complementing this is a parallel push for battery energy storage systems (BESS), targeting 1,500 MW of storage by 2035 to address intermittency and enhance grid resilience [1].

The company’s current projects underscore this commitment. For instance, Georgia Power is advancing solar-plus-storage developments in Laurens and Mitchell counties, with a combined capacity of 350 MW [3]. Additionally, it has requested certification for 3,022.5 MW of BESS across eight sites, with 765 MW already under construction [5]. These projects are not just incremental—they are foundational to meeting the state’s projected 8,500 MW of load growth through 2031 while maintaining affordability [4].

Regulatory and Market Tailwinds

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has amplified Georgia Power’s ability to execute its clean energy vision. The legislation provides tax credits and incentives that reduce the cost of transitioning to renewables and storage, a factor Georgia Power explicitly cites as critical to its financial viability [1]. For example, the utility’s residential and commercial rebate programs—such as incentives for heat pumps, LED lighting, and energy-efficient upgrades—are designed to drive demand-side efficiency, reducing overall grid strain and complementing supply-side investments [2].

Market trends in the Southeast further validate this strategy. While Q1 2025 saw a 7% decline in solar installations compared to Q1 2024, the region remains a solar powerhouse, with Texas and Florida leading the charge [6]. Georgia Power’s focus on utility-scale solar positions it to capitalize on the Southeast’s abundant sunlight and growing corporate demand for clean energy, particularly from data centers in the Atlanta region [1]. Moreover, the utility’s grid modernization efforts—including 1,000+ miles of new transmission lines—ensure it can accommodate this growth without compromising reliability [4].

ESG Alignment and Strategic Partnerships

Georgia Power’s renewable expansion is deeply embedded in its ESG strategy. The company has reduced carbon emissions by over 60% since 2007 and aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 [1]. Partnerships with entities like the U.S. Army Garrison Fort Eisenhower and Peachtree Corners further demonstrate its commitment to sustainability. A $72 million utility energy service contract (UESC) at Fort Eisenhower, for instance, replaces aging diesel generators with natural gas systems, saving $6 million annually while cutting emissions [2]. Meanwhile, the Curiosity Lab project in Peachtree Corners—a smart-city initiative featuring energy-efficient infrastructure—highlights Georgia Power’s innovation-driven approach to decarbonization [3].

These initiatives align with broader industry trends. As noted in Deloitte’s 2025 Power and Utilities Industry Outlook, utilities that integrate ESG into their core strategies are better positioned to attract capital and meet evolving regulatory expectations [5]. Georgia Power’s proactive engagement with ESG metrics, including its investments in the Southeast hydrogen hub and nuclear energy, reinforces its appeal to impact-focused investors [1].

Financial Viability and Long-Term Appeal

Critically, Georgia Power’s renewable investments are underpinned by a financially disciplined approach. The IRP emphasizes cost-effective resource planning, balancing capital expenditures with ratepayer affordability. For example, the company’s decision to modernize existing hydroelectric facilities—such as those at Tallulah and Yonah—extends their operational life while avoiding the high costs of new infrastructure [1]. Similarly, its procurement of renewable resources through competitive bidding ensures optimal pricing, a key consideration in an era of volatile energy markets.

Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) underscores the economic rationale: solar energy now accounts for 12% of Georgia’s in-state electricity generation, a figure poised to rise as costs decline and efficiency improves [3]. With the Southeast projected to see sustained investment in solar and wind, Georgia Power’s early-mover advantage in storage and grid modernization could translate into long-term margin protection and customer retention.

Conclusion

Georgia Power’s renewable expansion is more than a compliance play—it is a strategically designed pathway to long-term value creation. By leveraging IRA incentives, aligning with ESG priorities, and capitalizing on Southeast market dynamics, the utility is building a resilient, diversified energy portfolio. For investors, this represents a rare combination of regulatory certainty, financial prudence, and growth potential. As the energy transition accelerates, Georgia Power’s commitment to solar and storage positions it not just as a regional leader, but as a model for the future of utility-scale clean energy.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-05 17:06:17.485395

Plastics manufacturer Manner Polymers cut the ribbon at its new 108,000-square-foot, 100% solar-powered manufacturing facility in Mount Vernon, Illinois.

The plant will make electric vehicle PVC compounds, components for solar panels and materials for a wide range of industries. The company expects the project to expand its production capacity to 100 million pounds and create more than 60 jobs.

According to Manner Polymers, the solar-powered PVC compounding plant will use clean energy generated on-site.

The company serves a broad range of markets, including automotive, appliance, construction, telecommunications, industrial, medical and agriculture. Its flexible PVC compounds are used in creating vehicle components such as primary wire, battery cable wire, brake and trailer cable wire, electrical connectors, wire harnesses, plugs and over-mold terminators.

“Not only will we incorporate the most advanced manufacturing control systems available, but we will also produce substantially all of the electricity that we use,” Manner Polymers CEO Raj Bhargava said. “Our objective is to build the lowest cost, highest quality, most environmentally sustainable flexible PVC compounding plant in the world.”

Supported by a Reimagining Energy and Vehicles in Illinois (REV Illinois) incentive package, Manner Polymers invested $54 million into the construction of the facility.

As part of the incentive package, the State of Illinois also provided $2.5 million in infrastructure for a new rail spur, which provides direct access to Southern Illinois’ network of rail as well as the ability to easily move goods across the country.

The 30D and 45X tax credits are key federal incentives that were signed into law in 2022 to support a robust clean energy manufacturing ecosystem in the United States.
Why 30D and 45X Matter The 30D and 45X tax credits are crucial to supporting the global competitiveness of the American automotive industry.","Existing tax credits modified in the recently passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act of 2025 (OBBBA) are about to negatively impact the domestic automotive industry – a major economic driver and job creator. Just as traditional automotive manufacturers were accelerating work to build out electric vehicle (EV) supply chains, the OBBBA phases out existing tax incentives, including the clean vehicle tax credit (30D) and the advanced manufacturing credit (45X).

These tax credits helped catalyze significant job creation across the industry. As of June 2025, an estimated 62,700 jobs were created, and a total of $48.3 billion was invested in the manufacturing of batteries, in part due to 45X. Announced investments of $41.7 billion and more than 72,000 jobs are linked to facilities producing EVs and batteries eligible under the 30D tax credit.

This analysis breaks down the 30D and 45X tax credits, how recent changes to these credits might influence the U.S. automotive industry, and a potential path forward.

What are the 30D and 45X tax credits?

The 30D and 45X tax credits are key federal incentives that were signed into law in 2022 to support a robust clean energy manufacturing ecosystem in the United States.

The 30D credit offers eligible buyers of new clean vehicles up to $7,500 in savings. Although most EVs are cheaper to own over the course of their lifetime than their gas-powered counterparts, they tend to be more expensive up front. This tax credit was designed to help offset the higher cost of new electric vehicles, making them more affordable for Americans at the time of purchase. Starting in 2024, there are new eligibility requirements for clean vehicles; they cannot contain battery components that are assembled by a specified foreign entity, meaning that to receive the 30D tax credit, components from foreign countries that threaten U.S. national security cannot be used in eligible EV production.

The 45X tax credit supports the production of America’s supply of battery cells and critical minerals crucial for EV batteries, such as lithium, cobalt, and nickel. It also supports the domestic production of the components of clean energy technologies, such as solar and wind. It offers producers of eligible battery cells a credit of $35 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) of maximum capacity. The 45X credit also provides producers with a 10percent credit on costs incurred while producing critical minerals to the required purity levels.

Why 30D and 45X Matter

The 30D and 45X tax credits are crucial to supporting the global competitiveness of the American automotive industry. Without the incentives, the American EV market will continue to lag far behind foreign competitors like China.

The 30D tax credit is a central driver of EV affordability, domestic job growth, and reduced reliance on specified foreign entities. Through its domestic content requirement, it incentivizes the domestic production of EV components, encourages investment in the domestic EV supply chain, and helps ensure that consumers who want to go electric can buy American-made vehicles.

The 45X tax credit is crucial in supporting American manufacturing of battery materials, strengthening domestic energy security, creating U.S. jobs, and accelerating investment in American communities. It lowers the costs of production to help domestic producers compete with mature markets that have lower production costs, such as China. It also provides a tax incentive to drive growth in domestic manufacturing of battery components and the refining or recycling of critical minerals.

The credits are intended to operate in tandem: 30D makes American-made EVs more affordable for consumers while 45X makes it cheaper to build batteries domestically, which also makes EVs more affordable. Together, 30D and 45X are crucial to supporting the domestic EV market.

OBBBA Changes to 30D & 45X

Under the recently passed OBBBA, the 30D tax credit will now sunset on September 30, 2025 – seven years earlier than previously planned in the IRA. This will impact the EV market and its domestically produced materials significantly. Repealing 30D could:

Reduce the ability of consumers to buy EVs, dropping market demand as EV prices rise,

Increase risks to the domestic battery supply chain as the domestic and global industry becomes more reliant on cheaper, foreign EV components, and

Decrease domestic investment and job creation as it becomes more expensive to establish U.S.-based EV supply chains.

As for 45X, the OBBBA limits credit use until certain Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) requirements are met. FEOC rules apply at two levels: the foreign taxpayer level (prohibiting companies based in China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea from claiming the credit) and the product level (prohibiting a percentage of components sourced from these same countries). Beginning in 2027, integrated components will only qualify for the tax credit if they’re built into another element at the same facility, sold to an unrelated buyer, and made with at least 60 percent U.S.-sourced materials.

The new FEOC rules are expected to:

Ensure prohibited foreign entities (PFEs) cannot claim the credit: meaning that if a company is owned or controlled by a PFE, it is not eligible for the credit

Restrict material assistance from PFEs: companies are limited in purchasing specified amounts of key minerals, components, or materials from foreign entities.

Restrict licensing agreements with PFEs: meaning that companies can’t use technology or patents licensed from FEOCs in projects claiming the credit.

Restrict financial arrangements with PFEs: companies are limited in establishing specific funding or investment arrangements with specified foreign entities.

The new FEOC rules impose higher upfront costs on EV supply chain investment, encourage investors to relocate to markets outside of the United States, and complicate credit adoption, creating an uncertain environment for the domestic battery supply chain. Shortening the runway for 30D —which may lead to ceding market share to foreign vehicle manufacturers—and tightening 45X requirements hinder both the supply and demand sides of EVs in America.

The Path Forward

Despite the obstacles that the revised tax credits will bring, there are still ways to navigate future challenges. For example:

States can enact clean energy manufacturing policies to support EV adoption

The U.S. Department of Treasury can work with industry to streamline FEOC compliance guidance to support continued 45X tax credit adoption

Key players across the industry can continue to strengthen regional coordination through dialogue.",https://www.c2es.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/iStock-1356092421.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 19:03:56.946747

The company announced its purchase of a 22-acre property at 100 Heritage Reserve late last year. Over the next several years, the expansion is expected to create approximately 300 new high-skill jobs, adding to Milwaukee Tool’s already significant presence in the state.

Founded in Milwaukee in 1924, Milwaukee Tool develops job site solutions for the construction trades worldwide.

Americans looking for bargains and the latest tech, however, can find what they need in an EV, Drury argued.
Last year electric vehicles sat on the lot for 98 days.
""People are rushing out to dealerships to take advantage of these deals,"" he told ABC News.
The real driver of EV sales, however, will be models that cost less than the average transaction price of $55,689.","Ivan Drury was stunned when he found out how much his aunt was paying for a lease on the electric Honda Prologue SUV.

Drury, director of insights for Edmunds, tracks sales of electric vehicles closely. When his aunt inquired about leasing one, he replied with an emphatic ""yes.""

The next day she returned home with the Prologue. Her monthly payment? $250.

""There are killer deals out there, to say the least,"" Drury told ABC News. ""If you're contemplating getting an EV, just do it.""

The number of Americans who have swapped their internal combustion vehicles for a battery-electric one is growing, though at a slower rate than the industry had originally expected. Range anxiety, reports of batteries exploding and rapid battery degradation have ""curbed the enthusiasm"" for EVs, Drury noted, adding that consumer negativity toward electrics has boosted interest in traditional gas hybrids and plug-in vehicles.

Americans looking for bargains and the latest tech, however, can find what they need in an EV, Drury argued. Plus, the federal tax credit of up to $7,500 expires on Sept. 30, meaning prices could rise later this year, he said.

""Chevrolet Equinox EVs are a steal,"" Drury pointed out. ""Mercedes has been making huge price adjustments on its high-end EVs. Last year electric vehicles sat on the lot for 98 days. There are so many incentives stacked on top of each other from dealers.""

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 limits which electric models qualify for the federal tax credit, though consumers who choose to lease versus buy an EV could still walk away with the full $7,500 amount. According to Cox Automotive data, 57% of EVs were leased in May compared to 22% for the overall industry. The tax credit was rescinded as part of President Donald Trump's sweeping tax reform and spending package that was signed into law this summer.

Stephanie Valdez Streaty, a director at Cox Automotive, said more than 130,000 EVs were sold in July, the second highest volume ever. The upcoming credit expiration was directly responsible for the record sales, she said, adding that August and September will post similar, if not higher, numbers. Nearly every automaker benefited from the EV buying spree, she added.

""Cadillac did so well, Volkswagen was up hugely,"" she said. ""BMW saw sales up 24% in July versus June, Porsche was up 16.5%. This is a buyer's market now.""

John Roth, Cadillac's global vice president, said he was confident consumers would still seek out luxury EVs after the Sept. 30 deadline.

""We have said that the recent changes to federal incentives may lead to a short-term slowdown in overall EV sales,"" Roth told ABC News. ""However, 90% of luxury EV buyers today say they intend to purchase another EV, suggesting the impact could be less significant in the luxury segment. When you build the right EV, a Cadillac EV, customers will seek out your brand and make an informed purchase decision. This remains our approach no matter the propulsion system.""

Lucid, a luxury EV maker that builds its vehicles in Arizona, will continue to honor the $7,500 tax credit for owners of its new Gravity SUV until year-end.

""This was our decision,"" Marc Winterhoff, interim CEO of Lucid, told ABC News. ""Some Gravitys will only ship in Q4 and we don't want to frustrate customers.""

Like Lucid's competitors, Winterhoff said sales of the Gravity and the company's Air sedan have risen in recent weeks.

""The majority of our customers up until now have leased the cars,"" he said. ""It is understandable – we were only eligible for the lease version of the incentives, not the cash version. And people definitely took advantage of it.""

According to a recent survey from AutoPacific, 79% of ""EV considerers"" are aware of the tax credit, and ""the impact of the repeal will no doubt be consequential as it effectively raises the cost of EVs significantly, making them less affordable to many interested shoppers.""

Robby Degraff, manager of product and consumer insights at AutoPacific, said automakers are ""throwing money on the hood to get rid of these vehicles,"" resulting in ""insane"" prices for EVs.

""People are rushing out to dealerships to take advantage of these deals,"" he told ABC News. ""If you're on the fence about an EV, buy one ASAP. For a lot of people, it makes sense to upgrade to an EV.""

Degraff and Valdez Streaty agree that EV purchases will continue past Sept. 30, since consumers can still take advantage of state rebates. The real driver of EV sales, however, will be models that cost less than the average transaction price of $55,689.

""The options are relatively thin for affordable EVs,"" Degraff said. ""Affordability is still an issue and will be for the next few years.""",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/2bcb90c1-c154-4c0d-9788-98c442305454/lyriq-ev-gty-jt-250904_1757017805886_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=992,N,,2025-09-05 18:07:19.154727

This variation in climate change would impact the efficiency of the solar roofing system from “spatially differentiated fluctuations” (Jiang et al., 2014).

Additionally, to offset carbon emissions is largely dependent on the displacement of fossil-fuel based electricity. This depends on the structure of regional power supply, grid efficiency, and transmission losses. Further, the carbon footprint of the construction of the roofing system could negate the carbon benefits for 1.1 years.

Further challenges associated with the construction of the highway system include the estimated cost of construction and the need for regular and vigorous maintenance of the system. Nevertheless, the proposed initiative offers promising data towards increasing the use of solar energy as a power source.

Greening the future: towards the first-ever photovoltaic highway

While the project is still considered exploratory research and, if implemented, possess high logistical and economic costs, the future is promising. Innovative and radical solutions such as a global highway solar panel roofing network are ideas which are becoming increasingly more relevant as the world goes green.

While the research may be hypothetically data driven, the thinking-out-the-box nature of the project is what the world is desperately needing more of. To promote a radical shift from fossil-fueled energy to green-energy, radical and almost unrealistic ideas need to be considered.

As the world moves into the fifth industrial revolution, never before has technological innovation been as robust as it is today. Green energy innovation is at its peak and a global solar panel network is not a question of “maybe”, but one of “when”.

The research produced in Earth’s Future showcases promising data driven results. If implemented successfully, the project could generate up to four times the amount of energy produced in the United States annually. A green future is on the horizon, and is gaining speed every day.

To reduce our reliance on fossil-fuels, the shift towards renewable energy sources such as solar energy is vital. With increasing technological advancement, efficiency and widespread implementation of renewable sources are becoming more standardized.

As countries begin to invest in greener solutions, maximizing the environmental benefits is crucial.

THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!” While on the campaign trail, Trump promised to bring down electricity prices.

A recent Consumer Price Index report found electricity prices were rising at double the rate of inflation, having increased 5.5 percent over the past year.

And the general public may be starting to take notice.

“In the last couple of years, different items that have gone up in price have become media concerns. They become very visible, people get very angry — and I think electric rates are heading in that direction,” said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors’ Association.

Wolfe said that if rates continue to rise, “it’ll become a political issue.”

The Trump administration is already seeing it as one — and trying to put the blame on Democrats and renewable energy.

“That is a key challenge for us,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright told Fox Business Network’s “Mornings with Maria” when asked about utility bills this week.

“Things move slowly in the electricity grid. All sorts of crazy projects were under construction and being built on your electricity grids over the last four years,” he said.

Wright, in a recent interview with Politico, similarly blamed “the momentum of the Obama-Biden policies.”

However, he lamented, “We’re going to get blamed, because we’re in office.”

President Trump has taken a similar tack, blaming renewables even though a greater supply of renewable power would actually be expected to bring costs down.

On Truth Social this week, he decried “ridiculous, corrupt politician approved ‘’windmills.’”

He also previously posted, “Any State that has built and relied on WINDMILLS and SOLAR for power are seeing RECORD BREAKING INCREASES IN ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY COSTS. THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!”

While on the campaign trail, Trump promised to bring down electricity prices.

“Under my leadership, the United States will commit to the ambitious goal of slashing energy and electricity prices by half, at least,” he said at a rally last year. “We intend to slash prices by half within 12 months, at a maximum 18 months.”

Democrats are beginning to weaponize the issue against Republicans, especially after they repealed subsidies for wind and solar energy.

“The big, ugly bill is going to mean a lot of big, ugly energy bills arriving in the mail for Americans around the country,” Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) said last month.

Experts say a buildout of renewables would help bring down prices, but the impacts of Trump’s moves are not being felt yet.

“Residential retail electricity prices are set with basically a lag,” Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Christopher Knittel recently told The Hill. “Trump’s effects on the rate changes won’t take place until after the midterms.”

But they also note some of this administration’s policies, including those that attack renewable energy, are expected to exacerbate the issue in the future.

“It’s less power capacity being built, and then that means that there’s gonna be less supply of power and the same demand, so prices will be higher,” Thomas Rowlands-Rees, head of North America Research at BloombergNEF, said when asked about the repeal of renewable energy tax credits.

However, Knittel said blue-state policies that require a transition to renewable energy may also be contributing to the problem.

“Renewable policies in some of the blue states have put upward pressure on prices,” he said.

“Renewable portfolio standards that have forced or incentivized or regulated adoption of more renewables, partly with the idea that the Inflation Reduction Act would provide some financial support for that, and now that’s gone, or will be gone — that’s going to put upward pressure on prices,” Knittel said, noting the combination of the Democrat standards and Republican subsidy repeal are both contributing to this issue.

Meanwhile, Rowlands-Rees noted the Trump administration’s push to export more liquified natural gas (LNG) may also raise consumer electric prices.

“If the U.S. is increasing its ability to export that gas as LNG, where the exporters will make a much bigger profit than selling it locally in the U.S., then a lot of that gas will then go abroad, and so the more capability the U.S. has to export its gas, the higher gas prices will be in the U.S., for U.S. citizens,” he said.

“There’s such a huge contrast between the global price of gas and the domestic U.S. price of gas … and the only reason the two aren’t the same is because of this limited ability to export,” he added. “The U.S. is in this little bubble of cheap gas, and so the more that bubble is burst by pro-LNG export policies, the more … U.S. gas prices start to look like the rest of the world.”

U.S. electricity primarily comes from gas, coal, renewable and nuclear energy.

Another major driver of price increases is the buildout of data centers, as AI and other technologies are particularly power-hungry. If these centers don’t come with their own power source, they may just use whatever’s on the grid, driving up demand.

“There is this upward pressure because of data centers,” Rowlands-Rees said.

Both Democrats and Republicans have been at least somewhat supportive of boosting construction of data centers, though the Trump administration has particularly put forward plans to fast track them.

But Knittel said that’s just one factor contributing to the higher prices seen today.

“You also have climate change that is increasing wildfire risks,” he said. “That’s putting upward pressure on prices … on the West Coast.”

Meanwhile, Wolfe, with the National Energy Assistance Directors’ Association, also expressed concerns about the Trump administration’s efforts to slash a financial assistance program that helps low-income Americans afford to heat and cool their homes.

While this program has historically had bipartisan support and is likely to get money from Congress, the Trump administration has proposed defunding it.

“Even if Congress goes ahead and gives … funding, [it] doesn’t mean they’re going to spend it,” Wolfe said. “If you don’t have access to appropriate cooling and heating, you can die.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/trump_donald_02142025_GettyImages-2198926783.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-05 20:04:26.877499

At nearly 60 feet high and weighing 1,000 tons, the central solenoid will have a stored magnetic energy of 6.4 gigajoules and a maximum field of 13 tesla. Positioned along the central axis of the ITER tokamak, it will enable a powerful pulsed current of 15 megaamperes to be induced in the plasma for 300–500 seconds. The central solenoid will work in conjunction with the poloidal field magnets to control and shape the fusion plasma.

The modules: According to General Atomics, the construction of the six independent coil packs, or modules, that make up ITER’s central solenoid was a 15-year-long project, representing a major technical achievement for the United States. Completed inside the company’s Magnet Technologies Center near San Diego, Calif., each module required more than two years to fabricate, followed by testing, and then shipment to France, where they will be stacked to form the superconducting magnet.

The six modules, plus a spare, were wound from niobium-tin superconducting cable produced in Japan. According to the ITER Organization, five of the modules have arrived at ITER so far, while the sixth, completed in April, is en route. The seventh, spare module was displayed during a celebration of the project’s completion held August 28 at the Magnet Technologies Center.

General Atomics said the project underscores the ingenuity of California’s fusion engineering community, particularly in San Diego, and marks a major U.S. contribution to one of the most ambitious energy science projects in history.

Quotables: “This achievement is more than just a technical triumph,” said Wayne Solomon, vice president of Magnetic Fusion Energy for the General Atomics Energy Group. “It’s proof that General Atomics can deliver on the most complex challenges in energy while helping establish San Diego as a leading regional hub for fusion research and technology.”

“The central solenoid is unlike anything that has ever been built,” explained Nikolai Norausky, program manager of the Central Solenoid Project at General Atomics. “We’re talking about orders of magnitude of scale.

Concerns about running out of battery, finding charging stations, and navigating unfamiliar routes can create what's known as ""range anxiety.""

But one Reddit user's recent post in the r/Ioniq5N subreddit shows how planning tools and modern charging infrastructure are changing that experience.

In the post, the user shared that they completed their first EV road trip using the A Better Routeplanner (ABRP) app paired with a Bluetooth OBD dongle. ""It worked very well! The stops were accurate and had no issues at all,"" they wrote.

The OBD dongle plays a key role in this smoother experience. It gives ABRP a big advantage over standard navigation tools by sending the app real-time battery data.

As the car is driven, the ABRP learns from the vehicle's actual charge and usage patterns, which helps it predict more accurately when and where charging stops will be needed. Over time, this makes route planning more precise, essentially matching the built-in navigation system's access to the car's information, but with greater flexibility for drivers.

""There are some small things about ABRP that could be better … but having the reassurance that the car wouldn't die in the middle of the desert took all the anxiety out of it,"" the OP said.

Other EV owners jumped in the comments with their own experiences, agreeing that ABRP is a helpful tool for long trips.

""I did a 2,500-mile road trip a month ago in my Ioniq 6, and … I used ABRP to plan the trip, and input the destinations into my onboard NAV. I don't have the Bluetooth dongle, but found ABRP to [be] pretty dang accurate even without the car's data,"" one Redditor commented.

Others noted that the charging network itself has also improved dramatically over the last several years. ""Awesome to see this. In 2023 I was a little hesitant to take my GV60 out on that kind of trip because of charging anxiety. But I don't think I'd hesitate now,"" another commenter shared.

This smooth driving experience is just one piece of the larger picture. EVs also come with big perks for your wallet and the planet: Drivers save on gas and maintenance costs, thanks to fewer moving parts and cheaper electricity, and they help keep the air cleaner with zero tailpipe pollution.

For drivers who want to stretch those savings even further, charging at home with solar can make a big difference — you're essentially powering your car for free on sunshine.

The National Association of Truck Stop Operators (NATSO), the Society of Independent Gasoline Marketers of America (SIGMA) and the National Association of Convenience Stores (NACS) are urging lawmakers to reject the Recharge Act, legislation introduced by Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Oregon) that would allow electric vehicle (EV) charging stations at public interstate rest areas.

The associations argue that the bill threatens private investment in EV charging infrastructure by weakening a decades-old federal law that prohibits the sale of fuel, food and other automotive services at rest areas.

The law promotes business development at off-highway exits. Industry stakeholders say this model has helped spur investment in truck stops, travel centers, convenience stores, restaurants and other roadside services. They argue that allowing EV chargers at state-operated rest areas would tilt the playing field in favor of government-run locations that don’t face the same market pressures.

“The Recharge Act will not boost the number of EV charging stations available to drivers but rather will inject a nationwide hurdle that discourages the development of a safe and reliable EV charging network,” said David Fialkov, executive vice president of government affairs for NATSO and SIGMA.

Fialkov urged Congress to instead focus on policies that empower private sector development of EV infrastructure, noting that fuel retailers remain committed to expanding charging networks.

NACS echoed those concerns, saying allowing EV charging at rest areas would hinder competition and stall the growth of charging access.

“EV drivers should have competitive places to recharge just like we have competitive places to refuel,” said Matt Durand, deputy general counsel for NACS. “If we commercialize rest areas, it will undermine the dynamics that have helped build a refueling network and permanently put EV charging at a disadvantage—exactly the opposite of what the proponents of this bill want.”

The Recharge Act comes as the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) recently released Interim Final Guidance on the implementation of the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program. That guidance recommends locating EV chargers where the site host also owns the charger, a move supported by industry groups who say it will encourage private investment and ensure well-maintained facilities.

Fuel retailers, many of whom are working directly with state transportation departments, have already begun deploying EV fast-charging stations at sites near highway exits. These locations often offer restrooms, food, security and other amenities that travelers seek during 20- to 30-minute charging sessions.

The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) directs state DOTs to collaborate with private industry to build out a national charging network, and it does not include provisions permitting EV charging at rest areas.

In response to the Recharge Act, a coalition of fuel retailers, restaurants, blind entrepreneurs, local governments and other businesses sent a letter to senators urging them to oppose the legislation.

According to NATSO, thousands of fueling locations already exist within a mile of highway exits and are well-positioned to support widespread adoption of electric vehicles. The associations maintain that continuing to support private sector-led charging investments is the most effective way to scale access and promote long-term reliability.",https://cdn.informaconnect.com/platform/files/public/2025-09/background/rest-area.jpg?VersionId=7rdpMmyQUeZonQnyMFjvDkLmEfY2UM2n,N,,2025-09-05 16:07:33.991055

Arevon Closes on $250 Million for Kelso Solar

Do-it-all renewable developer Arevon Energy has secured a $250 million tax equity commitment from Wells Fargo Bank for Arevon’s two-phase 430 megawatt (MWdc) Kelso Solar Project in Scott County, Missouri.

The $500 million endeavor, Arevon’s first utility-scale renewable energy project in the state, is currently under construction, providing employment for upwards of 450 workers. Throughout its lifetime, it’s estimated that Kelso Solar will disburse more than $34 million to local governments, supporting schools, infrastructure, and first responders.

Arevon will own and operate the project on a long-term basis, with the first phase anticipated to achieve commercial operations by the end of 2025, and the second phase estimated to start operations in the first quarter of 2026. Kelso Solar has executed two long-term Environmental Attributes Purchase Agreements (EAPA) with hyperscaler Meta.

“This substantial tax equity raise — among the largest in Arevon’s history — demonstrates Arevon’s strong financial stewardship and our successful track record in executing transactions that fuel the company’s continued growth,” observed Denise Tait, Chief Investment Officer at Arevon.

Wells Fargo served as the Tax Equity Investor for the tax equity transaction. Sponsor Counsel was provided by Amis, Patel & Brewer; Sponsor Tax Counsel by Stoel Rives; Tax Equity Counsel by Sheppard Mullin; Sponsor Local Counsel by Husch Blackwell; and Tax Equity Local Counsel by BCLP. The transaction brings Arevon’s aggregate solar and energy storage project financings to $4.5 billion executed within the last two years.

Once operational, Kelso Solar will boost Missouri’s installed solar capacity by nearly 50%.

Encore powers up first energy storage system at Vermont’s Middlebury College

Encore Renewable Energy is celebrating the energization of its first storage project, which will provide demand mitigation services and cost savings to Green Mountain Power (GMP) and its customers.

South Street Storage, a 2 megawatt (MW), 8 megawatt-hour (MWh) utility-scale battery energy storage system (BESS), is located next to the South Street Solar project in Middlebury, Vermont. The lithium-ion battery systems were provided by KORE Power, a domestic manufacturer of BESS, which built the units installed by Encore at its Waterbury, VT facility. KORE’s operations team will also be coordinating with Encore to monitor the system’s performance.

“The South Street Storage project is a model of well-orchestrated grid modernization that is made possible when a developer, a manufacturer, and a utility share the vision of delivering safe, reliable, clean power to customers,” noted Jay Bellows, CEO of KORE Power.

“The past few years of intense storms and record heat have demonstrated the importance of a dependable electric grid, and we need more energy storage for that,” stated Encore founder and co-CEO Chad Farrell. “Thankfully, there are leading utilities like Green Mountain Power, [which] have long understood the value of locally sited energy storage for keeping our electricity supply clean and affordable.”

The South Street BESS adds to GMP’s growing network of stored energy, now pushing 75 MW, making it Vermont’s largest source of dispatchable power.

“When Vermont organizations work together, great things happen for communities and customers. This project will help deliver lower power costs during expensive peaks, by sending stored clean Vermont energy back to the grid when it’s needed most,” said Mari McClure, GMP’s President and CEO.

LS Energy Solutions Brings CAISO Storage Site Online

Grid-connected energy storage company LS Energy Solutions has commenced commercial operations at the Big Rock energy storage site in Imperial County, California. The 200 MW/400 MWh project, developed and operated in partnership with Gore Street Energy Storage Fund, is now providing resource adequacy (RA) and ancillary services for the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) electrical grid.

The Big Rock site (pictured at the top of this article) includes 137 LS-ES AiON-ESS containers storing energy for two-hour durations. LS-ES and GSF currently operate the site at 100 MW of deliverability to supply 400 MWh to CAISO and meet the four-hour discharge stipulation of a 12-year RA contract. In addition to supplying AiON-ESS containers, LS-ES is also supporting the site with operational services that include preventative and capacity maintenance, an extended warranty, and system remote monitoring for the life of the project.

“We are thrilled to see the Big Rock site in full commercial operation and providing storage services for CAISO,” said Curt Feldman, Vice President at LS Energy Solutions. “As California’s grid faces challenges from data center growth, wildfires, and the need to meet carbon reduction goals, utility-scale storage like Big Rock is more critical than ever.”

GSF acquired the Big Rock site in February 2023 from clean energy developer Avantus, marking the developer’s first project for CAISO. Big Rock joins other energy storage investments by GSF in Texas, Ireland, Great Britain, and Germany, with a total operational portfolio of 753.4 MW/924.1 MWh of energy storage assets.

Puget Sound Energy breaks ground on new utility-scale solar project in Washington

Puget Sound Energy (PSE) has started phased construction on its utility-scale solar facility known as the Appaloosa Solar Project in southeastern Washington. It will be partially co-located within the existing PSE Lower Snake River Wind Facility footprint in Garfield County, and will be capable of generating 142 MW of clean energy, enough to power more than 30,000 homes. The project will leverage existing transmission rights and infrastructure to minimize local impacts and project costs.

Appaloosa Solar will contribute 4% towards PSE’s 2030 clean energy targets, help meet peak demand during the summer, and create employment opportunities for approximately 300 workers during construction.

“We’re excited to see construction underway to bring clean, reliable utility-scale solar energy to our customers, especially during peak summer months when cooling demand is high,” stated Ron Roberts, PSE Senior Vice President of Energy Resources.

Appaloosa Solar will be constructed by Qcells EPC, which will serve as the module manufacturer and engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) solution provider. Construction will continue through 2026 with a commercial operation date expected at the end of next year.

Swift Current Energy Scores Financing for Biggest BESS in PJM

On Thursday, Swift Current Energy announced that it has secured $242 million in project financing for its 150 MW / 600 MWh Prospect Power Storage facility in Rockingham County, Virginia, which is currently under construction and is expected to reach commercial operation in 2026. Prospect Power will be the largest battery energy storage facility in Virginia and the PJM service area.

Prospect Power represents a substantial private investment in Rockingham County and will support local grid reliability, as Dominion Energy is set to add a record amount of new power projects in response to growing customer demand. Over the life of the project, Prospect Power is expected to contribute millions of dollars in additional tax revenue to the local community.

“Prospect Power will strengthen the local electric grid. We thank the banks we have worked with for years, as well as Dominion Energy and the local Rockingham County community, for trusting us to bring this project to completion,” said Eric Lammers, CEO and co-founder of Swift Current Energy.,

In 2023, Swift Current acquired Prospect Power from Clean Planet Renewable Energy, a joint venture between Open Road Renewable Energy and Eolian.

“Development of the grid-strength Prospect Power battery energy storage site began in 2018 to deploy fast-responding and flexible capacity to support increasing load growth in the region,” recalled CEO of Eolian, Aaron Zubaty. “This facility will be the largest battery energy storage project constructed in Virginia to date, supporting American energy dominance by efficiently using the existing transmission lines to open up capacity on the grid for all types of power generation.”

Truist Securities, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC), KeyBank, and Natixis acted as Joint Coordinating Lead Arrangers. Prospect Power, located on private land, holds a 15-year power purchase agreement with Dominion Energy Virginia. Morgan Lewis served as the legal counsel for Swift Current.

Circuit Court of Appeals, No.","By Jonathan Stempel

(Reuters) -A U.S. appeals court on Friday voided a Biden administration-era rule that changed the calculation of the petroleum-equivalent fuel economy of electric vehicles, a victory for 13 Republican state attorneys general who said the rule overstated EVs' efficiency.

The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis said the Department of Energy exceeded its authority by deciding to phase out during the 2027 to 2030 model years a ""fuel content"" factor that artificially inflated EV fuel economy, rather than eliminating that factor.

Writing for a three-judge panel, Circuit Judge Duane Benton said the department also failed to provide notice of the range of alternatives it was considering when it sought comments for the March 2024 rule, depriving commenters a chance to provide ""informed criticism.""

Petroleum equivalency is used in calculating whether manufacturers meet the Department of Transportation's corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards.

While the final rule was watered down from an earlier proposal, the Energy Department said keeping the fuel content factor would likely encourage EV production in the near term, while ""accelerating the widespread adoption of EVs in the United States during this pivotal time.""

Led by Iowa, the 13 states and the nonprofit American Free Enterprise Chamber of Commerce said overstating EVs' efficiency caused harm by allowing manufacturers to produce less-efficient gas-powered vehicles, thereby increasing greenhouse gas emissions, and still meet CAFE standards.

They also said encouraging EV sales makes it more costly to maintain roads, because EVs are heavy and cause more wear and tear.

Neither the Energy Department nor the office of Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird immediately responded to requests for comment.

Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, Texas, and Utah also opposed the rule.

Oral arguments took place five days before Republican President Donald Trump began his second term.

The case is Iowa et al. v. Wright et al., 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 24-1721.

Former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau set the target, requiring that in 2026 20% of passenger vehicles sold should be zero-emission vehicles.

Removing the requirement comes as automakers absorb Trump’s tariffs.

“We have an auto sector that because of the massive change in U.S. trade policy is under exteme pressure. We recognize that,” Carney said.

“The EV mandate adds to the liquidity issues they have, the financial challenges these producers have. They’ve got enough on their plate right now so we are taking that off.”

The Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers’ Association and others have been lobbying the government to scrap the EV mandate.

Flavio Volpe, Automotive Parts Manufacturers Associated president, noted the U.S. has ended EV incentives and industrial support and is going back to “pickup trucks and dinosaurs.”

Volpe said auto factories in Canada are geared to push product to the U.S., and Canada doesn’t have much choice in the short term.

“I’m glad that we punted,” Volpe said. “The White House has turned on the industry.”

Carney also announced measures for workers and businesses in those sectors most impacted by the U.S. tariffs and trade disruptions. The government is also making employment insurance more flexible and with extended benefits.

“We can’t rely on our most important trading partner like we once did,” Carney said.

Most imports from Canada and Mexico are still protected by the United States-Mexico-Canada trade pact, but Trump has some sector-specific tariffs that do apply for Canada despite the USMCA — known as 232 tariffs — which are having an impact on the Canadian economy and the auto sector in particular. There is the 50% tariff on steel and aluminum imports, for example.

The Big 3 American automakers, General Motors, Ford and Jeep-maker Stellantis, who all build in Canada, face the 50% tariff on steel and aluminum and a 25% tariff on parts and finished vehicles, with some exceptions for products covered under the USMCA.

Autos are Canada’s second-largest export and the sector employs 125,000 Canadians directly and almost another 500,000 in related industries. Volpe said Canadians buy about 2 million vehicles a year and make just under 2 million.

Carney said the government is also launching a new $370 million Canadian (US$268 million) production incentive to help Canada’s canola producers. China hit Canadian canola with a 75.8% tariff last month, a measure widely seen as a response to Canada’s 100% tariff on Chinese electric vehicles.",https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/daf0554/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1688+0+156/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fc1%2F6f%2F8891a850ba4ad4b4fe7ca280c8c3%2F61f9f53c03b84591b7ede9118d800cc5,N,,2025-09-05 17:08:13.769328

Of course, power generators will fight this and continue to delay growth in our power supply.
Thankfully, the 2021 Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA) gave us a roadmap for a broad, sustained clean energy boom across the state.
The federal budget rolls back clean energy tax incentives that would save Illinoisans hundreds on their energy bills.
While the federal government invests in the expensive, outdated fossil fuel industry, we can lower costs and build a clean energy future.","Across Illinois, families are experiencing a rude awakening upon opening their latest electricity bills — prices are skyrocketing. ComEd and Ameren customers are seeing a 50% jump in energy prices this summer. We believe customers deserve to know the real drivers of these price increases, and then what we as a state plan to do about them.

The facts are this: the primary driver of rising electricity bills in Illinois and beyond is data centers. According to PJM’s external watchdog, the PJM Independent Market Monitor, this year’s capacity price increases are “almost entirely the result of large load additions from data centers.” Supply, meanwhile, has remained relatively flat.

Recognizing this, could PJM have acted more proactively to avoid this mess? Absolutely. PJM has the nation’s longest wait times for new energy resources wanting to connect to the grid and come online. Those resources — mostly wind, solar and battery projects — sit in queues for more than five years. As PJM faces new demand from data centers, solutions must start there.

Of course, power generators will fight this and continue to delay growth in our power supply. Why? Because scarcity pays. Power generators — mainly fossil fuel companies — are making a killing off the backs of working Illinoisans. In the PJM territory, for example, they saw their capacity revenue jump six-fold to nearly $15 billion last year and more than $16 billion in the latest auction.

For years, members of the Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition have warned of these problems and the possibility of higher power bills and a supply crunch due to a rapidly changing energy market. As power demands increase and powerful interests throw up roadblocks to new clean power, fossil fuel plants are closing not because of any legislation, but because they simply do not make enough money to survive. Rising production costs and supply tensions have pushed them into the red, and what’s more — no one wants to pay more for a dirty, unhealthy, and unreliable product.

Thankfully, the 2021 Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA) gave us a roadmap for a broad, sustained clean energy boom across the state. CEJA accelerates deployment of the most effective tool to protect consumers from utility bill spikes: clean energy. In fact, large solar farms and onshore wind are the most cost-effective forms of new-build energy generation, even without tax subsidies. The roadmap in CEJA has not only allowed us to see unprecedented growth in clean energy across the state (in 2024 alone, Illinois added 2.5 gigawatts of capacity from solar) — it’s also creating clean energy jobs.

CEJA was and is nation-leading legislation, but it’s been nearly four years since the bill passed, and our power grid is facing new and unprecedented challenges that need to be addressed. That’s to say nothing of the Trump administration and H.R. 1, which dismantles the landmark provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act while doubling down on coal and gas. The federal budget rolls back clean energy tax incentives that would save Illinoisans hundreds on their energy bills. These rollbacks will also result in the loss of over $16.8 billion worth of investments and nearly 52,000 clean energy jobs by 2030.

While that is devastating for our nation and its clean energy future, we are fortunate that here in Illinois, CEJA safeguards us from aspects of these rollbacks. That’s why we need more of CEJA.

We introduced the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability (CRGA) Act because it gives us the tools to address the challenges facing our electric grid and lower costs for consumers, including:

• Expanding battery storage deployment to 6 GW to help meet demand and prevent price spikes

• Strengthening grid reliability by improving transmission efficiency and flexibility

• Helping consumers lower bills through rebates, energy-efficient appliances, and support for low-income programs as the Trump administration rolls back similar programs.

The CRGA Act provides the solutions we need to address our electricity crisis. While the federal government invests in the expensive, outdated fossil fuel industry, we can lower costs and build a clean energy future.

Illinois lawmakers have the opportunity to do just that by passing the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability (CRGA) Act when they return to Springfield during the October veto session.",https://s3-rd-prod.chicagobusiness.com/styles/1200x630/s3/dhahi-alsaeedi-U6tYeEhEVTk-unsplash_0.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 20:04:06.069907

Dividend Stability: A Pillar of Investor Confidence NiSource’s dividend history reflects a disciplined approach to capital returns.","In the ever-shifting landscape of utility regulation, NiSource Inc. (NI) finds itself navigating a complex web of political influence, infrastructure demands, and consumer affordability concerns in Indiana. The state’s recent legislative and regulatory developments—most notably SEA423/424 and HEA1007—have reshaped the utility sector, enabling investor-owned companies to recover costs for speculative projects and bypass traditional oversight. For NiSource, which operates through its subsidiary Northern Indiana Public Service Company (NIPSCO), these changes present both opportunities and risks. This analysis evaluates how NiSource’s strategic risk management and dividend stability position it to weather regulatory uncertainty in a politicized environment.

Regulatory Uncertainty and the Politicization of Utility Policy

Indiana’s utility regulations have become increasingly contentious, driven by heavy lobbying from investor-owned utilities and their financial contributions to state legislators. Legislation such as SEA423/424 (2025) allows utilities to charge customers for pre-construction costs of small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs), even if projects fail to materialize [1]. Similarly, HEA1007 accelerates approvals for new generation resources, including data centers, while permitting utilities to pass costs to consumers without pre-approval [1]. These policies have contributed to a 20-year high in year-over-year electric bill increases, with Indiana residents paying $28 more per month in 2025 compared to 2024 [2].

For NiSource, the implications are twofold. On one hand, regulatory approvals for infrastructure investments—such as NIPSCO’s $1.1 billion in gas modernization projects—provide a path to rate base growth [3]. On the other, the politicization of utility policy raises concerns about long-term affordability and consumer backlash. As Citizens Action Coalition’s Ben Inskeep notes, “The current framework prioritizes utility profits over transparency, leaving households and businesses to shoulder the burden of speculative projects” [2].

Strategic Risk Management: Balancing Growth and Stability

NiSource’s 2024 sustainability report underscores its commitment to mitigating risks through infrastructure resilience, emissions reductions, and community partnerships [4]. The company aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 72% from 2005 levels and is investing in technologies to assess weather-related disruptions. These initiatives align with broader ESG trends but also serve as a buffer against regulatory scrutiny. For instance, NIPSCO’s phased gas rate adjustments—approved by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC)—include enhanced contributions to the Universal Service Program, expanding discounts for low-income customers [3].

However, the company’s $19.4 billion capital expenditure plan from 2025 to 2029—focused on data center infrastructure and pipeline safety—introduces financial risks. While these investments are critical for long-term earnings growth, they also result in negative free cash flow and a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 5.33x [5]. Analysts highlight that NiSource’s ability to maintain its 6-8% annual adjusted EPS growth hinges on securing regulatory approvals and managing leverage [5].

Dividend Stability: A Pillar of Investor Confidence

NiSource’s dividend history reflects a disciplined approach to capital returns. In 2025, the company maintained quarterly payments of $0.28 per share, with a payout ratio of 57% and a yield of 2.76% [5]. This consistency is underpinned by its fully regulated utility model, which provides predictable cash flows. However, the recent rate hikes and infrastructure spending could strain this stability. For example, NIPSCO’s gas rate adjustments, while lower than initially proposed, still represent a 7.1% increase for residential customers [3].

The company’s 2025 guidance reaffirms its long-term growth trajectory, but investors must weigh this against the risks of regulatory overreach. As one analyst notes, “NiSource’s dividend is secure for now, but the politicization of utility policy in Indiana could erode margins if cost overruns or project delays arise” [5].

Conclusion: Navigating a Fragile Regulatory Ecosystem

NiSource’s resilience in Indiana’s regulatory environment depends on its ability to balance infrastructure investment with affordability and transparency. While the company’s strategic risk management practices and dividend discipline provide a foundation for stability, the politicization of utility policy introduces significant uncertainty. For investors, the key question is whether NiSource can maintain its growth trajectory without compromising its investment-grade credit profile.

As the utility sector grapples with the dual pressures of decarbonization and data center demand, NiSource’s success will hinge on its capacity to navigate regulatory headwinds while delivering on its long-term commitments. In a landscape where policy decisions are increasingly influenced by corporate interests, the company’s ability to align stakeholder expectations with financial performance will define its future.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-05 15:06:53.629335

Proceeds from selling in the lucrative U.S. market have helped Indian solar manufacturers update their supply chains in recent years so they were less dependent on imported Chinese parts and materials.
The cost of solar power — now half that of new coal-powered plants — and India's many sunny days are reasons that experts said installed solar power increased 30 times in the last decade.
India has also been importing solar modules from China.
Government policies restricting imports of solar components, incentives for solar manufacturers and mandates for solar power producers to purchase material from government-approved sources gave Indian companies the right signals to ramp up solar manufacturing, said Sanjay Verghese, ReNew’s group president for solar manufacturing and solar projects.","JAIPUR, India (AP) — On the edge of Jaipur, an Indian city known for its colorful bazaars and palaces, a bustling industrial complex is the epicenter of the country's push to compete with China in making components for solar technology.

India, the world's most populous nation, is jockeying for market share against the global leader in solar in part by selling to its own citizens, which helps the country with its other goal: meeting growing domestic demand for electricity.

In the government-subsidized zone that provides tax breaks, solar manufacturer ReNew's sprawling factory makes enough modules to produce 4 gigawatts of power each year — equivalent to the energy needed for approximately 2.5 million Indian homes. The 2-year-old facility that employs nearly 1,000 people serves as a symbol of the solar industry’s momentum. India’s capacity to build key solar components more than doubled in the fiscal year ending in March.

“When I got this opportunity, I was really happy that I was directly contributing to the clean energy transition,” said Monisha, an engineer at ReNew who goes by one name. She said the work has helped her become independent and assist her family with their finances.

The country still faces a steep climb in its efforts to develop solar manufacturing that could one day rival China, which makes more than 80% of all solar components in the world and supplies key materials to Indian manufacturers.

India's solar industry must also contend with a tougher sell to its biggest foreign customer, the United States. President Donald Trump’s tariffs of 50% on Indian goods took effect last month, while Trump’s administration and Republican lawmakers have taken other steps to hinder U.S. adoption of solar and other clean energy.

Still, India's clean energy appetite is helping its solar manufacturers deal with the external pressures. Energy analysts said India's domestic demand for solar power will likely reduce disruption from tariffs imposed by the U.S., where about a third of the solar panels produced by India were sold in a recent fiscal year. Proceeds from selling in the lucrative U.S. market have helped Indian solar manufacturers update their supply chains in recent years so they were less dependent on imported Chinese parts and materials.

While Indian solar manufacturers can sell at higher prices abroad, ambitious domestic clean energy targets and domestic demand will help them find buyers within India if sales in the U.S. slow, analysts said.

“This is a huge industry that can absorb these modules and cells that are being produced. We are not necessarily as export dependent as other countries are,” said Charith Konda, an energy analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

India's domestic solar market has already helped Hyderabad-based Vega Solar shift its customer base for off-grid solar modules for RVs, electric fences and other uses to customers in India in the years since the COVID-19 pandemic, said Vinay Keesara, a company director.

“Before the pandemic, 90% of my business was exports and 10% used to be domestic supply, now this has just flipped the other way around,” he said.

Government policies, demand push solar industry’s growth

One of the most carbon-polluting countries, India is making huge efforts to harness the power of the sun and other clean energy sources. The cost of solar power — now half that of new coal-powered plants — and India's many sunny days are reasons that experts said installed solar power increased 30 times in the last decade.

Before the U.S. tariffs were announced, researchers with IEEFA and Gurugram, India-based JMK Research wrote that India's demand for solar modules during the next two years could exceed what its manufacturers are selling within the country because so many are being exported. India has also been importing solar modules from China.

Konda said it was too early to determine how the U.S. tariffs will affect Indian solar manufacturers, but that the impact won’t be felt for at least another year because solar component orders are placed well in advance. And uncertainty remains over the fate of all of Trump's tariffs. Despite a U.S. court ruling against Trump’s tariffs, they remain in place until at least October while his administration files appeals.

India has nearly 170 gigawatts of renewable energy projects in the pipeline — most of which are solar — and are expected to be completed in the next few years. The country also has an ambitious clean energy target of 500 gigawatts by 2030.

Government policies restricting imports of solar components, incentives for solar manufacturers and mandates for solar power producers to purchase material from government-approved sources gave Indian companies the right signals to ramp up solar manufacturing, said Sanjay Verghese, ReNew’s group president for solar manufacturing and solar projects.

“We are in a good phase right now,” he said. “We are highly dependent on policy support, but we expect that momentum to be maintained.”

Despite supply chain bottlenecks, Indian manufacturing will likely grow

India still depends on imports of raw materials as well as finished solar components from China but is making progress on reducing its reliance. Government data showed India imported $1.3 billion worth of solar cells and modules from China in the first quarter of the year, down by more than one-third from the same period a year earlier. Cells are individual units that convert sunlight into energy, while modules are made up of multiple cells.

Neshwin Rodrigues, an analyst at climate energy think tank Ember, predicted that by 2030, India might be in a position of needing to import only the raw material polysilicon while producing other solar panel ingredients in the country.

According to India’s renewable energy ministry, the country’s solar module manufacturing capacity more than doubled to 74 gigawatts over the fiscal year ending March 2025. Solar cell manufacturing tripled in the same period, from 9 gigawatts to 25 gigawatts.

India still needs Chinese raw materials because it lacks infrastructure to mine and process them, but government initiatives to produce critical minerals are slowly addressing the problem, experts said.

Shubhang Parekh of the National Solar Energy Federation of India said the supply chains needed to process the raw materials are still a work in progress, but he's confident the challenges can be overcome.

“The next few years will be critical in determining how far we can go,” Parekh said.",https://img.designdevelopmenttoday.com/mindful/im/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/09/ap25247548866328.BNXWK9QTLj.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&crop=focalpoint&fit=max&q=70&w=1200,N,,2025-09-05 16:05:46.030201

The investments will help meet skyrocketing energy demand driven by AI data centers in line with the Trump Administration’s White House AI Action Plan and promote domestic access to these critical grid technologies. This move also supports the power needs of American manufacturing and other sectors and much-needed grid expansion and modernization efforts. Collectively, these investments will create thousands of jobs, bolster electrical equipment supply chains in the U.S., and contribute to the development of innovative technologies to enhance the security and resilience of the U.S. grid.

“If we are going to win the AI race, reindustrialize, and keep the lights on, America is going to need a lot more reliable energy,” said Energy Secretary Chris Wright. “Thankfully, Hitachi is delivering. The Trump administration looks forward to continuing to partner with private industry to ensure the American people access to affordable, reliable, and secure energy and thousands of high-paying jobs.""

“To lead in AI, America must lead in energy, and this investment proves we’re doing just that,” said Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. “Hitachi Energy’s historic investment in U.S. grid infrastructure is more than a single partnership, it signals a growing wave of investment in American energy. This momentum is driven by President Donald Trump's bold, pro-energy policies that are reigniting the American economy and powering the next generation of critical AI data centers with reliable, American-made energy.""

“Prioritizing domestic production of transformers accelerates President Trump’s energy dominance agenda by fortifying critical supply chains, strengthening U.S. energy security, and ensuring our nation can meet the growing energy demand. Investments like this are essential to powering AI infrastructure and advancing President Trump’s leadership in the global AI race,” said Jarrod Agen, Executive Director of the White House National Energy Dominance Council.

“Thank you, Hitachi Energy, for trusting Virginia, again! Hard-working Virginians and a business friendly environment are what first brought Hitachi Energy to the Commonwealth. Now, after years of success here, they are doubling down on that decision with this landmark investment in South Boston,” said Governor Glenn Youngkin. “Eight-hundred and twenty-five new jobs will be transformational for Southside Virginia, as will the power transformers those new hires are set to build. These transformers are critical to our Nation’s electrical grid and will be built right there in Virginia.”

Governor Youngkin continued: “We are also proud to announce a major workforce housing project to support Hitachi’s new employees. We are partnering with Halifax County and Virginia Housing to build 96 new homes supported by a grant from the Virginia Workforce Housing Investment Program.”

“Particularly at this critical moment for our growing energy demands, I’m excited to see Hitachi Energy expand their Virginia footprint, create hundreds of good-paying jobs in South Boston, and promote American energy security,” said U.S. Senator Mark Warner. “At the local level, this is a great investment in Southside Virginia’s economy and manufacturing industry. At the state and national level, this is an important strategic step to ensure we have the power needed to service our communities, businesses, and growing AI industry. I’m thrilled to see Hitachi Energy bring this important project home to South Boston.”

“In August, I visited Hitachi’s facility in Bland to learn about the company’s cutting-edge work. I’m thrilled that Hitachi Energy is expanding its footprint in Virginia by investing $457 million to build a state-of-the-art power transformer facility in South Boston – creating more than 800 jobs and boosting the region’s economy,” said U.S. Senator Tim Kaine. “Virginia’s workforce, educational opportunities, and innovative spirit have made it a great place to do business, and I look forward to continuing to partner with Hitachi to boost domestic manufacturing in the Commonwealth.”

“A vigorous and reliable electric grid is critical for the American economy and American energy dominance. Bringing power transformer production to the U.S. is vital as energy demand skyrockets,” said Congressman John McGuire (VA-05). “I am thankful that this investment will establish a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in South Boston, to produce necessary large power transformers. This $457 million investment and facility will create more than 800 new high-paying jobs in Virginia’s Fifth Congressional District. I would like to thank Hitachi, President Trump, and Governor Youngkin for working with me to make this a success.”

As a part of the federal Inflation Reduction Act, the Climate Pollution Reduction Grant program provides states, local governments, territories and tribes with funds to develop and implement plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other harmful air pollutants. The North Carolina CPRG planning project is an interagency effort with the state Department of Transportation, Department of Commerce, Department of Natural and Cultural Resources and DEQ serving as lead.

North Carolina was awarded $3 million from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for the planning phase of the CPRG. As part of the program requirements, North Carolina developed and submitted a Priority Climate Action Plan (PCAP) in 2024. North Carolina is now developing a Comprehensive Climate Action Plan (CCAP), which is due to the EPA in December 2025. The PCAP identified North Carolina’s highest priority greenhouse gas reduction measures and determined the methods for ensuring equitable implementation of these measures for the benefit of all North Carolinians. The CCAP builds upon the PCAP and will update and expand upon North Carolina’s existing climate strategies, ensuring that these policies align with the latest available science, modeling and best practices.

The company plans to break ground on the new headquarters on September 17, with construction expected to end by early 2027.

The 286,000-square-foot facility will include 76,000 square feet of office space and 210,000 square feet dedicated to the assembly of customer automation projects. The headquarters will also bring together approximately 350 employees from several West Michigan locations into one campus.

The new headquarters will feature modern spaces for collaboration with global customers and demonstrations of the latest automation technologies.

It will include amenities such as an on-site fitness center and workspaces that inspire sustainable practices and connection to the outdoors, all to help attract and retain leading talent. The 45-acre campus will also feature walkable, bikeable paved paths integrated into an ecologically restored native prairie landscape.

The site's focus will include native prairie for biodiversity, on-site solar panels and a goal to have baseline facility operations fully powered by renewables.

Michigan won the project over South Carolina, where JR Automation operates another facility. The Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC) stated that securing the global headquarters project for JR Automation would help the region achieve its goal of becoming a ""smart” manufacturing hub.

The company first introduced the project to Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and MEDC CEO Quentin Messer, Jr., at Select USA 2024, an annual conference aimed at promoting foreign direct investment into the U.S.

“This new headquarters reflects Hitachi’s commitment to advancing smart manufacturing,” said Charlie Takeuchi, Vice President and Executive Officer of Hitachi and President and Chief Executive Officer, Hitachi Americas, Ltd. “It will serve as a global catalyst for advancement of integrated automation worldwide.”

Established in 1980, JR Automation supports a variety of industries, including automotive, life sciences, e-mobility and energy storage. Hitachi acquired the company in 2019.

Fortescue was awarded $12.7 million in state incentives for the project last year, as well as $11 million worth of Detroit brownfield incentives.
EV battery investment has gone from boom to bust.
Ford Motor Co.’s EV battery plant in Marshall, which was scaled down significantly in size and jobs promised, is among the few survivors in the wave of advanced manufacturing investment promises Michigan landed during EV fever a few years ago.
The latest — and largest — scrapped project in Michigan was Sandisk's $63 billion semiconductor complex and 10,000 jobs near Flint.","“Following a comprehensive review of the economics, logistics and deadlines to meet our ambitious decarbonization targets, we have made the decision to reassess the future of our U.S. manufacturing strategy and no longer proceed with our planned Michigan Manufacturing Center,” a company spokesperson said in a statement to Crain’s on Friday.

Fortescue Zero — the Australian mining company’s green energy investment arm — rolled out plans for the factory in the city’s Milwaukee Junction district in January 2024 as part of its diversification into clean energy. It had planned to redevelop an old industrial building at 601 Piquette Ave., next to the Ford Piquette Avenue Plant Museum.

Construction crews have been performing cleanup and remediation work at the 14-acre site, including electrical upgrades inside the 410,000-square-foot, six-story building. The company is now preparing to put the property on the market and seeking buyers.

Fortescue was awarded $12.7 million in state incentives for the project last year, as well as $11 million worth of Detroit brownfield incentives. The company has not received any of the funds or incentives, the Michigan Economic Development Corp. confirmed to Crain's. Fortescue is working to close out its contracts with the city and state.

“While we are grateful for the strong support received from the Governor, Mayor and Detroit community, we must do everything we can to remain focused on opportunities to meet our near-term global decarbonization goals,” the company said in the statement.

Production had been anticipated to start in the fourth quarter. Fortescue’s plan was to first build packs for watercraft powertrain systems with cells sourced from Asia, before moving into the high-performance segment of passenger vehicles.

EV battery investment has gone from boom to bust. Michigan spent hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars to lure EV projects that may no longer have a business case as the Trump administration slashes EV tax credits and rolls back gas emissions rules, and consumer demand for EVs cools.

Ford Motor Co.’s EV battery plant in Marshall, which was scaled down significantly in size and jobs promised, is among the few survivors in the wave of advanced manufacturing investment promises Michigan landed during EV fever a few years ago. For example:

General Motors Co. switched its Orion Assembly plant from EVs to gas-powered pickups and SUVs and pulled out of an LG Energy joint venture battery plant near Lansing;

Our Next Energy is treading water without a clear path to deliver the $1.6 billion battery factory and 2,100 jobs in Van Buren Township promised in 2022;

Gotion’s $2.6 billion battery plant near Big Rapids is on indefinite hold;

CustomCells’ plan for a $100 million plant and 250 jobs in Warren is dead;

the $400 million Nel Hydrogen factory in Plymouth Township was mothballed;

BorgWarner shut down its EV battery operation in Michigan and laid off 188;

Plastic Omnium walked away from a $171 million hydrogen project in Grand Blanc; and

GM is mulling whether to pull the plug on its hydrogen plant in Detroit.

The latest — and largest — scrapped project in Michigan was Sandisk's $63 billion semiconductor complex and 10,000 jobs near Flint. The company, which Michigan had been courting for years, abandoned the project due to ""massive economic uncertainty at the national level,"" Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said.

For its part, Fortescue said it will “continue to explore opportunities to advance zero emission technologies” in the U.S. even as it pulls the plug in Detroit.

“Current policy settings and market conditions in the United States, including recent changes to critical tax credits, have created significant uncertainty around the viability of long-term investment in advanced manufacturing,” the company said.",https://s3-rd-prod.crainsdetroit.com/styles/1200x630/s3/601Piquette_0_2.jpg?h=d6661bde,N,,2025-09-05 15:05:39.038632

Moreover, selective elements of the U.S. framework for tax credits could remain untouched despite the passage of the ""One Big, Beautiful Bill Act,"" preserving discrete niches for domestic deployment capital.
In a post-IRA rollback environment, mobility of capital—not merely technological differentiation—will define competitive advantage.","The Inflation Reduction Act (""IRA"") functioned as the cornerstone of U.S. clean-technology capital investments. From its enactment in 2022 through late 2024, the statute's long-dated production and investment tax credits, alongside federal grants and loan guarantees, have helped catalyze more than $400 billion in announced clean-energy projects and attract a record infusion of domestic and cross-border venture capital (""VC"") into early-stage climate technology. The Trump administration's executive orders that effectively terminate or suspend IRA-authorized federal funding, coupled with fast-tracked congressional efforts to accelerate phaseouts of energy tax credits, have now reversed those tailwinds and injected material uncertainty into U.S. deal flow.

For domestic investors, the rollback undermines the fundamental risk-return profile that justified aggressive climate allocations. Early-stage technologies—particularly in electrolytic hydrogen, next-generation batteries, and carbon-intensive industrial process abatement—had been modeled on 10-year credit visibility and an expanding pool of downstream project finance. According to an industry advocacy group, roughly $15.5 billion of clean-energy projects have been cancelled through April, depriving portfolio companies of offtake anchors and eroding exit valuations. For deals that are not cancelled outright, term sheets are being redrafted to include ""IRA-contingent"" covenants, stepped-down earnouts, and broader material-adverse-change language. As capital costs rise and regulatory clarity recedes, many U.S. funds are triaging follow-on rounds and prioritizing less policy-exposed assets, such as software-enabled efficiency or grid analytics.

At the same time, the rollback is propelling a marked geographical reallocation of venture dollars. Recent commentary from global climate funds highlights Europe's appeal as a more policy-stable jurisdiction: The EU Green Deal Industrial Plan, complemented by tightening efficiency mandates for data centers and those proposed for heavy industry, delivers clear revenue signals without the specter of wholesale repeal. Some fund managers have publicly stated intentions to weight new vehicles toward Scandinavian, UK, and continental European opportunities. Parallel interest is emerging in Canada, India, and segments of Latin America where national incentive programs remain intact. The Johns Hopkins Net Zero Industrial Policy Lab estimates that up to $80 billion in battery and solar supply-chain investment could be diverted abroad under an aggressive U.S. retreat—a figure that, if realized, would meaningfully enlarge foreign investment pipelines.

The shift is not, however, a zero-sum windfall for offshore markets. Valuations that were previously buoyed by IRA-driven competitive pressure are compressing, and European investors now confront currency risk, burgeoning demand for project interconnection, and nascent local content rules. Moreover, selective elements of the U.S. framework for tax credits could remain untouched despite the passage of the ""One Big, Beautiful Bill Act,"" preserving discrete niches for domestic deployment capital. Data-center power procurement, increasingly indifferent to generation source, is also creating openings for gas-peaker retrofits and modular nuclear technologies, both of which can support venture-backed service providers.

Looking forward, the transactional landscape will pivot on legislative timing. If a partial compromise preserves core credits beyond 2028, a subset of investors may reenter with structured downside protection. Absent that, U.S. VC participation is likely to stagnate, and corporate venture units may redirect balance-sheet commitments toward cross-border joint ventures that can satisfy global decarbonization mandates more predictably.

For counsel and capital providers alike, the imperative is twofold: reprice policy risk with granular diligence on statutory exposure and develop jurisdiction-agnostic syndication strategies capable of arbitraging uneven regulatory trajectories. In a post-IRA rollback environment, mobility of capital—not merely technological differentiation—will define competitive advantage.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15759_5453.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 15:05:56.419981

(ADAMS) – Homeowners in Fort Wayne and Northeast Indiana will soon have an easier way to finance energy efficiency and renewable energy projects thanks to a new partnership between two local credit unions and the Indiana Energy Independence Fund (IEIF).

The collaboration brings the Smart-E residential clean energy lending product to Indiana for the first time, launching initially in Fort Wayne and Northeast Indiana with plans for statewide expansion.

Homeowners can now apply for financing for projects such as heat pump installation, weatherization, solar, other energy-saving improvements, and home appliances.

“I’m encouraged that Fort Wayne could host the launch of a lending product designed to make energy efficiency upgrades and renewable energy sources more accessible. Our community works each day to help individuals and families grow and succeed, and this program provides unique opportunities for us to be good stewards of the environment and find potential savings for homeowners,” said Fort Wayne Mayor Sharon Tucker.

The City released the following:

MidWest America Federal Credit Union and Urban Beginnings Choice Federal Credit Union will be the first financial institutions in Indiana to offer Smart-E loans, which provide credit unions with a streamlined, ready-to-use clean energy financing product that allows them to offer low-interest loans to homeowners for projects such as solar panel installations, heat pumps, weatherization and other energy-saving improvements.

“At MidWest America we believe in helping more people, and this product does exactly that,” said Shad Edwards, Chief Lending Officer of MidWest America Federal Credit Union. “By making financing for home energy improvements more affordable and accessible, we’re helping families lower utility costs, increase comfort, and invest in their homes. It’s a win for our members, our community, and our shared future.”

“At Urban Beginnings, we believe that access to fair and innovative financial tools is the foundation of community stability and growth,” said Diane Starks, CEO of Urban Beginnings Choice Federal Credit Union. “This lending product will give more families in Fort Wayne the chance to make smart, money-saving energy improvements—building wealth, cutting costs and improving quality of life for years to come.”

The Indiana Energy Independence Fund, the state’s nonprofit green bank, led the effort to establish Smart-E in Indiana by recruiting and vetting lenders and contractors, facilitating credit enhancements to lower interest rates, expand program eligibility, and support program implementation.

“This launch brings us one step closer to ensuring that every Hoosier, including low- and moderate-income residents—whether they live in a big city or a small town—can benefit from reliable, affordable energy,” said Alex Crowley, Executive Director of the Indiana Energy Independence Fund. “By teaming up with community-focused lenders in Northeast Indiana, we’re making it easier for Hoosiers to invest in projects that reduce costs, improve comfort and strengthen Indiana’s energy future.”

The Indiana partnership was brought together with support from a number of philanthropic partners across the state and region.

Initially launching in Fort Wayne, this initiative is designed to scale across Indiana, helping all Hoosiers access affordable clean energy financing while supporting local economic development.",https://media-cdn.socastsrm.com/uploads/station/2853/fbShare.png?r=76715,N,,2025-09-05 15:07:10.547458

A new report released Thursday by HERE Technologies and SBD Automotive examines the EV market against four key metrics, with the strength of public charging being highly valued among American consumers.

“We’ve found, from doing this in the last couple of years, that that’s what consumers, predominantly in the U.S., are valuing, more than a lot of other things,” Ronak Amin, global product marketing lead for HERE Technologies said, pointing out Kentucky’s improvement on the annual HERE–SBD EV Index, as the report is known. Kentucky moved up from 45th to 28th in the U.S. rankings, an improvement driven largely by the state’s development of high-speed charging locations.

Iowa moved up from 38th last year to 23rd, thanks to the addition of 340 new charge points, the study found.

West Virginia, however, slipped from its previous ranking of 18th to 42nd, due to declines in average charging power.

To measure the EV maturity in each state, researchers from HERE, a mapping and location technology company, and SBD, which offers automotive and mobility consulting, focused on four key metrics: the number of chargers per road length, average charger power, number of chargers per EV in the state, and the number of registered EVs in the state.

Surveys and other research from the study pointed to an EV market in the United States that continues to lag both the European Union and Asia.

“The U.S. is, unfortunately, still very skeptical of EVs. Very state-by-state, of course. But in general, quite skeptical, compared to Europe,” Robert Fisher, SBD electrification and sustainability principal, said. The study’s survey showed 57 percent of U.S. respondents are likely to purchase a gasoline-powered car for their next vehicle, compared to only 25 percent in Europe.

The EV demand among early adopters in the U.S. has largely been filled, Fisher said.

“They’ve been very interested in EVs. Now they’ve got EVs. So now we have to figure out how to get from that market to the general mainstream population,” he said. “That’s where the biggest struggle is. Europe has already gotten past that point.”

Adding to that struggle is the loss of the $7,500 federal tax credit, set to expire at the end of the month.

However, even if indications seem to show a lagging U.S. market for EVs — continuing to be outpaced by Europe and Asia — it is not diminishing, observers said, pointing to the growth of charging technology and of electric vehicle purchases. The U.S. added 37,000 charging points in the last year — a 19 percent increase — and grew charging power by 52 percent, according to the study.

Another trend surfacing, Amin said, is the leadership taken by the automakers themselves to build out charging locations.

“That’s something that in the beginning stages of electrification, they shied away from,” he said. “And they’re kind of moving in and investing in those higher-powered chargers. Fast charging is really what consumers want and need, and that’s one of the areas helping to move some of these states up.”

If approved by shareholders, the new pay package could make Musk the world’s first trillion dollar executive, and would mark a new level of outsized pay in a country already known for extreme compensation.
He can’t help himself,” said Telemetry analyst Sam Abuelsamid who follows Tesla stock, which is down 25% this year.
The plunge in Tesla sales this year was largely due to blowback over Musk’s affiliation with President Donald Trump.
Tesla sales have fallen precipitously in Europe after Musk aligned with a far-right political party in German.","The world's richest man could become its first trillionaire if Elon Musk hits a series of extremely aggressive targets for his electric car company over the next decade, according to a proposed pay package released by the company.

Tesla said in a regulatory filing Friday that it will hand Musk shares worth as much as 12% of the company in a dozen separate packages if the company meets certain performance targets, including massive increases in car production, share price and operating profit. If approved by shareholders, the new pay package could make Musk the world’s first trillion dollar executive, and would mark a new level of outsized pay in a country already known for extreme compensation. But the payoff is in shares, not cash, and the goals are extreme as well.

Musk overcame doubters to turn Tesla into the world's most valuable car company, but he could face even steeper odds in hitting the targets set by the company's compensation committee — not least because of Tesla’s main business of making electric vehicles is currently in a slump, in part because of Musk's foray into right-wing politics.

“It doesn’t matter how much money he gets. He can’t help himself,” said Telemetry analyst Sam Abuelsamid who follows Tesla stock, which is down 25% this year. “And the more he talks, the more he turns off potential customers.”

To get his first package of shares equivalent to 1% of the company, Musk would have to convince investors in the stock market that Tesla is worth $2 trillion in total, double what they value it today, and also hit several other milestones. To receive all the shares offered and make him the world’s first trillion-dollar man would require that market value to then rise to $8.5 trillion, double that of the world’s most valuable company now, chipmaker Nvidia.

Among other goals, sales of all Tesla vehicles would eventually also have to reach 20 million, nearly triple its entire sales since it was founded more than two decades ago. Musk would also have to vastly expand Tesla's robot and robotaxi businesses by selling a million of the bots and a million of the driverless cabs, the latter a business that has only begun to roll out its taxi service and is behind rivals, such as Waymo.

Musk would also need to remain with Tesla for at least seven and a half years to cash out on any stock, and 10 years to earn the full amount.

Musk has been one of the richest people in the world for several years.

Musk would also receive more voting power over Tesla under the proposed plan. The EV company is set to hold its annual shareholders meeting on Nov. 6, where investors will vote on the new pay package. Tesla’s last shareholders meeting was on June 13 of last year, where investors to restore Musk’s record $44.9 billion pay package that was thrown out by a Delaware judge earlier that year. Late last year the revoked the package for a second time. Tesla has appealed the ruling

A condition of the 11th and 12th tranches of the plan includes Musk coming up with a framework for someone to succeed him as CEO.

The plunge in Tesla sales this year was largely due to blowback over Musk’s affiliation with President Donald Trump. Tesla also faces intensifying competition from the big Detroit automakers and particularly from China.

Tesla sales have fallen precipitously in Europe after Musk aligned with a far-right political party in German.

Sales plunged 40% in July in the 27 European Union countries compared with the year earlier even as sales overall of electric vehicle soared, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association. Meanwhile sales of Chinese rival BYD continued to climb fast, grabbing 1.1% market share of all car sales in the month versus Tesla’s 0.7%.

In its most recent quarter, Tesla reported that quarterly profits plunged from $1.39 billion to $409 million. Revenue also fell and the company came up short of even the lowered expectations on Wall Street.

Investors have grown increasingly worried about the trajectory of the company after Musk had spent so much time in Washington this year, becoming one of the most prominent officials in the Trump administration in its bid to slash the size of the U.S. government.

Last month Tesla said that it gave Musk a stock grant of $29 billion as a reward for years of “transformative and unprecedented” growth despite the drop in sales and profits.

Tesla said at the time that the grant was a “first step, good faith” way of retaining Musk and keeping him focused, citing his leadership of SpaceX, xAI and other companies. Musk said recently that he needed more shares and control so he couldn’t be ousted by shareholder activists.

Tesla's stock rose 2.5% in midday trading.

Prime Minister Mark Carney’s government will make the announcement Friday as one of a series of measures to help companies in the industries most affected by United States President Donald Trump’s trade war, according to people familiar with the matter, speaking on condition they not be identified.

Canada to stall electric vehicle rules as Carney seeks to boost auto sector Back to video

Article content

Article content

Carney’s predecessor, Justin Trudeau, had passed rules that required automakers to ensure that at least 20 per cent of sales were zero-emission vehicles by the model year 2026. But the government won’t implement that target now: instead, it will launch a review of the so-called “electric vehicle availability standard” to make sure it doesn’t create burdens on automakers, the people said.

Article content

It’s another illustration of how Carney, who took over in March, is unwinding some policies of the Trudeau era, partly because of the pressures of the trade war. The prime minister has withdrawn many retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products, scrapped a carbon tax on consumers’ use of fossil fuels and ditched a new tax on digital services after Trump complained about it.

Article content

The auto industry has been lobbying for months to change the EV mandate, arguing that the targets were unrealistic and would add costs and put jobs at risk.

Article content

In June, about 8 per cent of new vehicles sold in Canada were zero-emission. The percentage has declined this year because the federal government cut off a consumer incentive that had offered as much as $5,000 to buyers of clean-energy vehicles, saying the program had run out of money.

“These targets were made up by the government, not based on any sound assessment of real market dynamics,” Brian Kingston, chief executive of the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers’ Association, said in an interview in August. The CVMA represents General Motors Co., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler parent Stellantis NV, all of which have manufacturing operations in the province of Ontario.

Article content

Under the electric vehicle mandate, manufacturers that failed to meet the sales targets would likely have been forced to restrict sales of internal combustion engine vehicles or buy credits from companies like Tesla Inc., Kingston said.

Article content

The Canadian auto industry is highly integrated with the U.S. sector and is under threat from the Trump administration’s tariffs on foreign-made vehicles. GM and Stellantis have both curtailed production at their assembly plants in the province of Ontario since the trade war began.

Article content

Automakers around the world are facing higher costs from U.S. tariffs, and EV manufacturers are also facing pressures from US moves to gut fuel-efficiency rules and remove consumer tax credits for buying EVs.

Attorneys general in Rhode Island and Connecticut announced plans to file a new lawsuit challenging the Trump administration’s order to halt work at the nearly complete Revolution Wind project.
“Now, with zero justification, Trump wants to mothball the project, send workers home, and saddle Connecticut families with millions of dollars in higher energy costs.
Federal officials are also scrutinizing other projects including New England Wind and SouthCoast Wind.
We have harms to our ability to meet our state statutory clean energy and climate goals, as Your Honor recognized.","Attorneys for several states, including Massachusetts, and the Trump administration sparred in federal court on Sept. 4 over the president’s attempts to pause offshore wind permitting, while a pair of other New England states also opened up a new front in the legal battle over wind power.

Attorneys general in Rhode Island and Connecticut announced plans to file a new lawsuit challenging the Trump administration’s order to halt work at the nearly complete Revolution Wind project.

Rhode Island AG Peter F. Neronha and Connecticut AG William M. Tong, both Democrats, said the installation had been fully vetted and approved at both the state and federal levels “and is supported by binding contracts and legal mandates.”

“Revolution Wind is fully permitted, nearly complete and months from providing enough American-made, clean, affordable energy to power 350,000 homes,” Tong said in a statement. “Now, with zero justification, Trump wants to mothball the project, send workers home, and saddle Connecticut families with millions of dollars in higher energy costs. This kind of erratic and reckless governing is blatantly illegal, and we’re suing to stop it.”

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management on Aug. 22 halted work at Revolution Wind, which is about 80 percent complete, citing “concerns related to the protection of national security interests.” Project developer Ørsted on Sept. 4 sued the Trump administration in a bid to get its project back on track.

President Donald Trump for years has been a vocal opponent of offshore wind, an industry that New England elected officials from both parties have touted as key to the region’s energy independence and economic development.

Federal officials are also scrutinizing other projects including New England Wind and SouthCoast Wind.

The AGs said their lawsuit would be filed on Sept. 4 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, seeking to “restore the rule of law, protect their energy and economic interests, and ensure that the federal government honors its commitments.”

Neronha appeared to reference a New York Times report published on Sept. 3 that said the White House has instructed several government agencies to work together on upending the offshore wind industry.

“Just yesterday, we learned of reports that the Administration is pulling in staff from several different unrelated federal agencies, including Health and Human Services, to do its bidding. Does this sound like a federal government that is prioritizing the American people?” Neronha said. “This is bizarre, this is unlawful, this is potentially devastating, and we won’t stand by and watch it happen.”

Their lawsuit will allege that the stop work order at Revolution Wind violates the Administrative Procedure Act and the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, laws the AGs said “demand reasoned decision-making, fidelity to statutory limits, and respect for the settled expectations of sovereign States and regulated parties.”

More than a dozen AGs, including AG Andrea J. Campbell, made a similar argument in a lawsuit they filed in May challenging Trump’s Jan. 20 directive ordering federal officials not to issue permits for wind projects before completion of a “comprehensive assessment” of leasing and permitting practices.

Their case emerged for oral arguments before Judge William G. Young in Boston on Sept. 4.

Attorneys for the plaintiffs, including Massachusetts Assistant AG Turner Smith, contended that Trump’s order runs afoul of the APA by pausing all permitting nationwide without a specified end date.

“States are already suffering significant harms as a result of this pause. We’re eight months in and counting with no end in sight,” Turner said. “We have harms to our ability to provide reliable and affordable energy to our residents. We have harms to our ability to meet our state statutory clean energy and climate goals, as Your Honor recognized. We have significant economic harms that are playing out on the ground already.”

“The fact that the agency has discretion or doesn’t face strict timelines for every single action that has to happen or be approved before a wind energy project can go forward doesn’t mean that the agency can just shut down that program willy-nilly on the basis of a presidential directive that invokes a couple of buzzwords like national security or the environment,” added James Auslander, an attorney for the Alliance for Clean Energy New York. “The Administrative Procedure Act would be rendered meaningless if agencies could just point to the president’s words and provide no administrative record for their actions.”

Michael Robertson, an attorney for the Trump administration, contended that the president’s order does not outright declare that no permits will ever be issued for wind power.

“If we look at the wind directive, the key parts of it are that there is going to be an assessment and review attached to this, that it’s going to be consistent with applicable law, and the president’s justifications that he provided for the wind directive,” Robertson said. “We might be in a different scenario under the APA if none of those three things were there, if the president just said, full stop, ‘That’s it.’ But even if it’s abbreviated, that explanation is sufficient under the APA to address these decisions.”

And these costs can vary by location too. Research from Insurify pointed to New Jersey, California, Maryland, Illinois and Arizona as the five most affordable places for EV drivers who don’t want to spend a fortune on EV insurance premiums.

It’s still more expensive in those states to insure an EV than a gas-powered car, but the gap between these insurance policies is more dramatic in the 10 states on this list.

Also see six ways to cut car insurance costs, according to experts.

Arkansas

Insurify found that Arkansas has a 99% cost difference in insuring an EV instead of a gas-powered car, making it the most expensive state for EV owners. The average annual premium for EVs is $4,817, which is much higher than the $2,415 annual premium that owners of gas-powered cars pay.

Pennsylvania

Pennsylvania comes in No. 2 on Insurify’s list. It also has a 99% cost difference in insuring an EV vs. a gas-powered car. Gas-powered cars have an annual premium of only $2,314 in the state, while EVs have an annual premium of $4,598.

Idaho

Idaho has a 95% cost difference, with the average annual premium for EVs standing at $3,332. Gas-powered cars have an average annual premium of only $1,708. Not many people use EVs in Idaho, per Insurify, but that could change as more Californians move into the Gem State.

Iowa

The cost difference in Iowa is 87%, and severe weather in the state can make insurance even more expensive. The average annual premium for EVs is $3,354, while gas-powered cars have a much more affordable $1,793 average annual premium.

Delaware

Delaware is next on the list, with a 76% cost difference between insurance for EVs and insurance for gas-powered cars. The premiums are also higher in general compared with those of other states on this list. The average annual premium for EVs is a towering $5,840, while owners of gas-powered cars have to deal with an annual average premium of only $3,310.

Louisiana

The cost difference in Louisiana stands at 72%, and due to the risk of hurricanes and tornadoes, insurance premiums are higher here than in most parts of the country. EV owners have to square off against an average annual premium of $5,197, while owners of gas-powered cars have to contend with just a $3,015 average annual premium.

Indiana

There is a 71% cost difference between insuring EVs and insuring gas-powered vehicles, but the state in general has lower premiums. In fact, U.S. News & World Report ranked Indiana No. 7 for the cheapest annual car insurance rates.

The average annual premium for EVs comes to $3,520, while drivers have to pay an average annual premium of only $2,061 for gas-powered cars.

Nevada

Nevada has a 70% cost difference for insuring an EV compared with insuring a gas-powered car. The average annual premium for EVs is currently $5,791, while the average annual premium for gas-powered cars in Nevada is $3,403.

New Mexico

If you want to be an EV owner in New Mexico, you will have to pay an average annual premium of $3,597. However, you’ll have to pay an average annual premium of only $2,117 if you want to buy a gas-powered car. The cost difference for these two insurance policies is 70%.

Florida

Florida is the last state on the list, with a 66% cost difference between the two insurance policies. The state’s frequency of hurricanes and floods results in higher insurance premiums. The average annual insurance premium is $5,283 for EVs and $3,189 for gas-powered cars.

Under the agreement, Japan gets a 15% tariff on its goods and pledges to buy $8 billion worth of American products per year. The Government of Japan has agreed to invest $550 billion in the United States, the White House said.

U.S. Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick, hailed the deal as “historic” and said that the U.S. would use the $500-billion Japanese investment “to build our energy infrastructure, chip manufacturing, critical minerals mining, and shipbuilding to name a few.”

“What we’ve achieved with our Japanese partners is an absolute game changer for America’s future — and it’s exactly what the America First trade agenda is all about,” Lutnick posted on X.

In July, as President Trump touted “the largest trade deal in history” with Japan, he also noted that the United States and Japan are set to conclude another deal to form a joint venture for LNG in Alaska.

“We concluded the one deal ... and now we're going to conclude another one because they're forming a joint venture with us at, in Alaska, as you know, for the LNG,” President Trump said in comments on the deal to GOP lawmakers at the White House.

Japanese companies have been considering investments in the $44-billion Alaska LNG project, but so far they have appeared to be concerned that the costs may be too high, considering the cold weather in Alaska and the scale of the pipelines needed to bring the project on stream.

Energy companies are ready to commit to buying $115 billion worth of LNG from Alaska once President Trump’s pet energy project gets done, the company in charge of the project, Glenfarne, said in June, noting that as many as 50 companies have expressed formal interest.

In a significant victory for Michigan’s business community and environmental future, the Michigan Senate passed a bipartisan package of bills this week to establish a state-level regulatory framework for carbon sequestration projects. The Detroit Regional Chamber supports this legislation, recognizing its immense potential to unlock substantial economic development and position Michigan as a leader in clean energy technology.

This legislative package is a critical step forward in providing a clear and efficient pathway for businesses to invest in carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. By creating a state-managed permitting process overseen by the Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy, Michigan can streamline the often-lengthy approval process, which has been a barrier to investment. This greater certainty will attract new businesses and encourage existing companies to expand their operations in the state, knowing they have a reliable framework for managing their carbon footprint.

Captured carbon has the potential to be transformed into a valuable commodity rather than a liability. There are growing opportunities to utilize captured CO2 in producing cement, synthetic fuels, and even plastics, creating new revenue streams and strengthening Michigan’s manufacturing sector.

The MI SUCCESS Coalition, a consortium of business and labor groups that the Chamber is a member of, has lauded the legislation for its potential to create good-paying jobs and stimulate economic investment that has been flowing to neighboring states.

While some opponents raised concerns about carbon storage’s long-term safety and financial responsibility, the legislation includes provisions to address these issues. The bills establish several new funds, including a long-term remediation fund to address any future CO2 leakages and a community benefits fund to mitigate any local impacts of these projects.

The Chamber applauds the Michigan Senate for its forward-thinking approach. This legislation strikes a crucial balance between environmental responsibility and economic prosperity. Michigan is seizing a vital opportunity to enhance its economic competitiveness by providing a clear regulatory pathway for carbon sequestration. The Chamber urges the House of Representatives to swiftly take up and pass this critical legislation.",https://www.detroitchamber.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/carbon-sequestration_featured.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 22:02:13.035063

SACRAMENTO, CA (MPG) - At a joint press conference today, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Pacific Southwest Region Administrator Josh F.W. Cook joined local Sacramento leaders to celebrate the region’s successful attainment of the 2008 National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ground-level ozone by the 2024 deadline. The announcement reflects successful efforts to reduce air pollution and improve public health in California’s fastest-growing metropolitan area. It also underscores the region’s ability to achieve real results through shared vision and partnership.

“Congratulations to the Sacramento metropolitan area for successfully meeting the 2008 ozone standard by the 2024 deadline – this is an achievement that will bring numerous health benefits to communities across the region,” said EPA Regional Administrator Josh F.W. Cook. “I am so pleased to see multiple air districts coming together to accomplish this result. Achieving attainment not only brings cleaner air for residents, but spares businesses from additional regulatory burdens and secures continued eligibility for future federal funding for vital transportation and infrastructure projects.”

In addition to Administrator Cook, the event speakers included Congresswoman Doris Matsui, Sac Metro Air District Board Chair and Folsom Mayor Sarah Aquino; Sacramento Metro Chamber Representative Cameron Gallad; Placer County Health & Human Services Director Dr. Rob Oldham, and Sac Metro Air District Board Member, City of Sacramento Mayor Pro Tem, and California Air Resources Board Member Eric Guerra. The event was emceed by Sac Metro Air District Air Pollution Control Officer Dr. Alberto Ayala.

Yolo-Solano Air Quality Management District Board Chair and Yolo County Supervisor Lucas Frerichs, along with Air Pollution Control Officer Gretchen Bennitt, represented the District at the event. Yolo-Solano Air Quality Management District Board Member and Woodland City Councilmember Tom Stallard was also in attendance.

“By working together, we’ve made real progress in reducing air pollution and safeguarding public health for our communities, but our work doesn’t stop here,” said Yolo-Solano Air Quality Management District Board Chair and Yolo County Supervisor Lucas Frerichs. “Our District, along with the other air districts in the Sacramento region, is focused on advancing creative solutions that meet stronger air quality requirements and protect the well-being of our communities long into the future.”

The EPA’s final determination confirms that, based on certified air quality data from 2022 to 2024, the region has reduced ground-level ozone, meeting the 2008 standard by the 2024 deadline. The benefits of attainment include cleaner air for residents, helping businesses avoid additional regulatory requirements, less damage to crops and other vegetation, and continued eligibility for federal transportation and infrastructure funding. The air districts of the Sacramento region will now begin the process of developing a maintenance plan and requesting formal redesignation from the EPA to remove the region’s severe nonattainment status.

Education

Jil McIntosh graduated from East York Collegiate in Toronto, and then continued her education at the School of Hard Knocks. Her early jobs including driving a taxi in Toronto; and warranty administration in a new-vehicle dealership, where she also held information classes for customers, explaining the inner mechanical workings of vehicles and their features.

Experience

Jil McIntosh is a freelance writer who has been writing for Driving.ca since 2016, but she’s been a professional writer starting when most cars still had carburetors. At the age of eleven, she had a story published in the defunct Toronto Telegram newspaper, for which she was paid $25; given the short length of the story and the dollar’s buying power at the time, that might have been the relatively best-paid piece she’s ever written.

An old-car enthusiast who owns a 1947 Cadillac and 1949 Studebaker truck, she began her writing career crafting stories for antique-car and hot-rod car club magazines. When the Ontario-based newspaper Old Autos started up in 1987, dedicated to the antique-car hobby, she became a columnist starting with its second issue; the newspaper is still around and she still writes for it. Not long after the Toronto Star launched its Wheels section in 1986 – the first Canadian newspaper to include an auto section – she became one of its regular writers. She started out writing feature stories, and then added “new-vehicle reviewer” to her resume in 1999. She stayed with Wheels, in print and later digital as well, until the publication made a cost-cutting decision to shed its freelance writers. She joined Driving.ca the very next day.

In addition to Driving.ca, she writes for industry-focused publications, including Automotive News Canada and Autosphere. Over the years, her automotive work also appeared in such publications as Cars & Parts, Street Rodder, Canadian Hot Rods, AutoTrader, Sharp, Taxi News, Maclean’s, The Chicago Tribune, Forbes Wheels, Canadian Driver, Sympatico Autos, and Reader’s Digest.

Pfluger Op-Ed: Much-Needed Tax Cuts Are Coming For Hardworking Texans,Not Available,,,,,https://energycommerce.house.gov/posts/rep-pfluger-op-ed-much-needed-tax-cuts-are-coming-for-hardworking-texans,"I refer, of course, to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — the largest Working Families Tax Cut package in American history.
“ I am of the camp that Americans deserve lower taxes and less government in their lives, and at the heart of the Working Families Tax Cut are critical tax reforms that deliver on that belief.
This bill is a massive win for hardworking Texans and will help foster an economy that is pro-growth, pro-worker, pro-family, pro-business and pro-energy.
“ Arguably, the most impactful victory of this bill is the permanent extension of the 2017 Trump tax cuts.
The Working Families Tax Cut is a clear response to what the American people demanded in November: rein in wasteful spending, grow the economy and make life genuinely affordable again.","WASHINGTON, D.C. – The following op-ed by Congressman August Pfluger (TX-11) appeared in the GoSanAngelo this week.

“Republicans in Congress, alongside President Trump, delivered a transformative piece of legislation on America’s 249th anniversary. I refer, of course, to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — the largest Working Families Tax Cut package in American history.

“ I am of the camp that Americans deserve lower taxes and less government in their lives, and at the heart of the Working Families Tax Cut are critical tax reforms that deliver on that belief. This bill is a massive win for hardworking Texans and will help foster an economy that is pro-growth, pro-worker, pro-family, pro-business and pro-energy.

“ Arguably, the most impactful victory of this bill is the permanent extension of the 2017 Trump tax cuts. Without this, over 475,000 taxpayers in Texas’ 11th Congressional District would have faced a devastating 26% tax increase — the largest in American history. This alone protects middle-class families, small businesses and workers from a crushing financial blow, but it doesn’t stop there.

“ Seniors in Texas, 88% of whom receive Social Security benefits, will now pay zero taxes on those benefits. Hourly workers will also keep more of what they earn, with overtime pay, tips and even interest on car loans for new American-made vehicles being exempt from taxation up to generous limits. This will put thousands of dollars back in the pockets of hardworking Texans.

“ Families will see additional support through an expanded Child Tax Credit of up to $2,200 per child, which will help offset today’s rising costs of raising a family. For Texans looking to grow their family through adoption, this bill improves the Adoption Tax Credit by making up to $5,000 of it refundable — easing the financial burden that can unfortunately prevent families from adopting.

“ To help parents plan ahead and start saving early for their children’s future, this bill also establishes Trump Savings Accounts. These accounts will allow parents, family members or employers to contribute up to $5,000 annually. These funds can later be used for educational opportunities, home ownership and other essential life investments.

“ This legislation also supports school choice by encouraging donations to scholarship funds, which will expand educational opportunities for every child in Texas, regardless of their ZIP code.

“ Rural communities also stand to gain. A higher death tax exemption ensures that the more than 2 million family farms nationwide are protected from the crippling double taxation that far too often forces families to sell the land when passed from one generation to the next.

“ Texas businesses and energy producers win big, too. This bill makes the 199A small business deduction permanent at 20%, which is a vital lifeline for Texas entrepreneurs to feasibly launch a business. It also broadens tax breaks for research and equipment purchases, encouraging Made-in-America investments and creating thousands of jobs across several industries.

“ Additionally, the Biden Administration’s ‘ Green New Scam ’ tax credits totaling $500 billion will be repealed. These misguided subsidies hindered America’s energy sector and threw taxpayer dollars down the drain. This legislation also eliminates the natural gas tax — delivering certainty to American energy producers, preserving energy jobs and incentivizing domestic production that will ultimately lead to lower costs for American consumers.

“ With all the misinformation circulating, it is imperative to separate fact from fiction. The Working Families Tax Cut is a clear response to what the American people demanded in November: rein in wasteful spending, grow the economy and make life genuinely affordable again.

“ Nothing is perfect, but this legislation delivers historic, tangible wins for Texans. I am excited about this bill, and all of Texas District 11 should be, too. ”",https://d1dth6e84htgma.cloudfront.net/ENERGY_AND_COMMERCE_SQUARE_LOGO_a093c47e5f.png,N,,2025-09-05 14:05:17.966431

August 5: The Interior Department eliminates a requirement to publish a five-year schedule of offshore wind energy lease sales and to update the lease sale schedule every two years.
At the start of all this, the U.S. had three offshore wind projects that were fully operational and five that were under construction.
The tumult has rippled out into the states, where regulators in Massachusetts and Rhode Island are delaying plans to sign contracts to procure additional energy from offshore wind projects.
We’ll see the Interior Department formally begin to rescind permits, as it indicated it would do in numerous court filings.","The Trump administration’s war on the nascent U.S. offshore wind industry has kicked into high gear over the past week, with a stop work order issued on a nearly fully-built project, grant terminations, and court filings indicating that permits for several additional projects will soon be revoked.

These actions are just the latest moves in what has been a steady stream of attacks beginning on the first day Trump stepped into the White House. He appears to be following a policy wishlist that anti-offshore wind activists submitted to his transition team almost to a T. As my colleague Jael Holzman reported back in January, those recommendations included stop work orders, reviews related to national security, tax credit changes, and a series of agency studies, such as asking the Health and Human Services to review wind turbines’ effects on electromagnetic fields — all of which we’ve seen done.

It’s still somewhat baffling as to why Trump would go so far as to try and shut down a nearly complete, 704-megawatt energy project, especially when his administration claims to be advancing “energy addition, NOT subtraction.” But it’s helpful to see the trajectory all in one place to understand what the administration has accomplished — and how much is still up in the air.

Winter

January 20: Trump issues a presidential memorandum temporarily halting all new onshore and offshore wind permitting and leasing activities “in light of various alleged legal deficiencies underlying the Federal Government’s leasing and permitting of onshore and offshore wind projects,” while his administration conducts an assessment of federal review practices. The memo also temporarily withdraws all areas on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf from offshore wind leasing.

March 14: The Environmental Protection Agency pulls a Clean Air Act permit for Atlantic Shores, which was set to deliver power into New Jersey.

Spring

April 16: The Department of the Interior issues a stop work order to Empire Wind, a New York offshore wind farm that began construction in 2024. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum accuses the Biden administration of giving the project a “rushed approval” that was “built on bad and flawed science,” citing feedback from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

May 1: The Interior Department withdraws a Biden-era legal opinion for how to conduct permitting in line with the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act that advised the Secretary to “strike a rational balance” between wind energy and fishing. The Department reinstated the opinion issued under Trump’s first term, which was more favorable to the fishing industry.

May 2: Anti-offshore wind group Green Oceans sends a 68-page report titled “Cancelling Offshore Wind Leases” to Secretary Burgum and acting Assistant Secretary for Lands and Minerals Management Adam Suess, according to emails uncovered by E&E News. The report “evaluates potential violations of Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) and related Federal laws in addition to those generally associated with environmental protection.”

May 5: Seventeen states plus the District of Columbia file a lawsuit challenging Trump’s January 20 memo halting federal approvals of wind projects.

May 19: The Interior Department lifts the stop work order on Empire Wind after closed-door meetings between New York governor Kathy Hochul and President Trump, during which the White House later says that Hochul “caved” to allowing “two natural gas pipelines to advance” through New York. Hochul denies reaching any deal on pipelines during the meetings.

June 4: Atlantic Shores files a request with New Jersey regulators to cancel its contract to sell energy into the state.

July 4: Trump signs the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which imposes new expiration dates on tax credits for wind and solar projects, including offshore wind, as well as on the manufacture of wind turbine components.

Summer

July 7: The Environmental Protection Agency notifies the Maryland Department of the Environment that the state office erred when issuing an air permit to the Maryland Offshore Wind Project, also known as MarWin, because the state specified that petitions to review the permit would go to state court rather than the federal agency. The state later disagrees.

July 17: New York regulators cancel plans to develop additional transmission capacity for future offshore wind development, citing “significant federal uncertainty.”

July 29: The Interior Department issues an order requesting reports that describe and provide recommendations for “trends in environmental impacts from onshore and offshore wind projects on wildlife” and the impacts that approved offshore wind projects might have on “military readiness.” The order also asserts that the Biden administration misapplied federal law when it approved the construction and operation plans of offshore wind projects.

July 30: The Interior Department rescinds all designated “wind energy areas” on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf, which had been deemed suitable for offshore wind development.

August 5: The Interior Department eliminates a requirement to publish a five-year schedule of offshore wind energy lease sales and to update the lease sale schedule every two years.

August 7: The Interior Department initiates a review of offshore wind energy regulations “to ensure alignment with the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act and America’s energy priorities under President Donald J. Trump.”

August 13: The Department of Commerce initiates an investigation into whether imports of onshore and offshore wind turbine components threaten national security, a precursor to imposing tariffs.

New Jersey regulators also decide to delay offshore wind transmission upgrades by two years. They officially cancel their contract with Atlantic Shores.

August 22: The Interior Department issues a stop work order on Revolution Wind, an offshore wind project set to deliver power to Rhode Island and Connecticut, citing national security concerns. The 65-turbine project is already 80% complete.

Interior also says in a court filing that it intends to “vacate its approval” of the Construction and Operations Plan for the Maryland Offshore Wind Project.

August 29: The Interior Department says in a court filing that it “intends to reconsider” its approval of the construction and operations plan for the SouthCoast wind project, which was set to deliver power to Massachusetts.

The Department of Transportation also withdraws or terminates $679 million for 12 offshore wind port infrastructure projects to “ensure federal dollars are prioritized towards restoring America’s maritime dominance” by “rebuilding America’s shipbuilding capacity, unleashing more reliable, traditional forms of energy, and utilizing the nation’s bountiful natural resources to unleash American energy.” The grants include:

$427 million to develop the Humboldt Bay Offshore Wind project, set to be the first offshore wind terminal on the Pacific Coast.

$48 million to develop the Arthur Kill Terminal in New York City, a staging and assembly site for wind turbines. (The developers intend to move forward without the grant.)

$47 million for the Sparrows Point Steel Marshalling Port Project in Baltimore, which will produce monopiles for wind turbines. (The developers intend to move forward without the grant.)

$39 million for the Norfolk Offshore Wind Logistics Port, a project to upgrade an existing port to support offshore wind development

Pre-Fall

September 3: The Interior Department says in a court filing that it intends to vacate its approval of the construction and operations plan for Avangrid’s New England Wind 1 and 2, which were set to deliver power to Massachusetts.

The New York Times also reports that the White House has instructed “a half-dozen agencies to draft plans to thwart the country’s offshore wind industry,” including asking the Department of Health and Human Services to study “whether wind turbines are emitting electromagnetic fields that could harm human health,” and asking the Defense Department to probe “whether the projects could pose risks to national security.”

September 4: The states of Rhode Island and Connecticut, as well as Orsted, file lawsuits challenging the stop work order on Revolution Wind.

At the start of all this, the U.S. had three offshore wind projects that were fully operational and five that were under construction. As of today, the Trump administration has halted just one of those five, but it has threatened to rescind approvals for each and every remaining fully permitted project that hasn’t yet broken ground.

The tumult has rippled out into the states, where regulators in Massachusetts and Rhode Island are delaying plans to sign contracts to procure additional energy from offshore wind projects.

Looking ahead, we can expect a few things to happen over the next few weeks. We’ll see the Interior Department formally begin to rescind permits, as it indicated it would do in numerous court filings. We’ll also likely get an opinion from a federal court in Massachusetts in the case that states filed fighting Trump’s Day One memo. Orsted also said it intends to ask for a temporary injunction, so it’s possible that Revolution Wind could resume construction soon.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTU1OTcxMi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1Nzg3Njg3NX0.k6lEZlrzTrB3mS5hjKJjOTEGznQPT5xX_Bcq9a4C-8Q/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-09-05 14:04:58.345653

September 5, 2025

St. Clair County, ILLINOIS — U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin today announced the launch of Feed It Onward, a new national initiative designed to reduce food waste and strengthen food security across America. At Scott Air Force Base in Illinois, Administrator Zeldin was joined by representatives from Frey Farms, who delivered a truckload of fresh produce, that otherwise would’ve been sent to a landfill, to feed and support military families on base.

“I want to thank Frey Farms and Scott Air Force Base for being our first partners of EPA’s new Feed It Onward initiative to reduce food waste in the United States,”said Administrator Lee Zeldin. “Feed It Onward highlights how Americans of all walks of life, from our farmers, service members, business owners, and government can join hands and help our fellow Americans. We hope this initiative will help amplify the Americans working each day to help their fellow citizens.”

“At Frey Farms, we believe that good food should never go to waste. Partnering with the EPA gives us the opportunity to live out that value in a meaningful way - reducing waste, nourishing families, and honoring the men and women who serve our country,” said Frey Farms CEO Sarah Frey. “I’m especially grateful for Administrator Zeldin’s leadership and vision. Together, I’m confident we can advance solutions that not only protect our environment, but also provide real support for our nation’s military families.”

In the United States, more than one-third of all food goes uneaten and gets thrown away. This creates an impact on both our environment and American families’ wallets. Food waste has become the largest component of materials reaching our landfills, more than any other type of trash. At the same time, millions of families across the country don't have enough food to eat.

Data from EPA’s 2025 report, Estimating the Cost of Food Waste to Consumers (pdf), shows that individual consumers lose $728 annually to food waste—equivalent to $14 thrown away every single week. A family of four wastes nearly $3,000 worth of food each year, representing approximately 11 percent of their total household spend on food. Programs like Feed It Onward can help the environment and help American families save money by making sure good food doesn’t go to waste.

Feed It Onward connects food donors with communities in need while reducing the environmental impact of food waste in landfills. Feed It Onward will continue to partner with private and public entities to highlight food waste and recovery initiatives and connect food providers with opportunities to reduce our nation’s food waste.

Background:

Feed It Onward is a voluntary program that partners with farms, restaurants, grocery stores, food brands, and military bases donating food within their communities.

As part of the America 250 celebration, Feed It Onward reflects the values that have always made the country strong — generosity, grit, and community.

Hitachi Energy is the energy manufacturing arm of Japanese multinational conglomerate Hitachi.","Nearly half of the investment, $475 million, is earmarked for the construction of a new power transformer manufacturing facility in South Boston, Virginia. When built, the facility will become the biggest producer of large power transformers in the US. Construction on the facility is scheduled to start this year, with operations expected to commence by 2028.

The facility will be built alongside Hitachi’s existing campus, creating more than 825 jobs in the region, the company said. It went on to stress the support of “the Trump administration, Governor Youngkin, Virginia’s General Assembly, and the Commonwealth’s congressional delegation” in supporting the construction of the new facility.

“Power transformers are a linchpin technology for a robust and reliable electric grid and winning the AI race. Bringing production of large power transformers to the US is critical to building a strong domestic supply chain for the US economy and reducing production bottlenecks, which is essential as demand for these transformers across the economy is surging,” said Andreas Schierenbeck, CEO of Hitachi Energy.

In addition, Hitachi intends to expand its breaker and switchgear manufacturing operations near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to further solidify its US footprint. The investment is part of a broader $9bn global investment plan by Hitachi to expand its energy and manufacturing capacity worldwide. As part of its commitment to the US market, Hitachi has secured assurances from the White House to expedite new US power component manufacturing projects.

Transformers play a crucial role in power distribution. They are used to increase or decrease the voltage of alternating current for efficient transmission and distribution. The investment follows a warning from Schierenbeck last year that the transformer supply chain was “overwhelmed” and could no longer meet the demand for grid equipment needed for crucial infrastructure projects worldwide.

Demand across the transformer sector is expected to surge from $48bn in 2024 to $67bn in 2030, significantly driven by the projected load growth emanating from the data center sector. Current lead times for large transformers range from 80 to 120 weeks. As a result, companies such as Hitachi are scrambling to increase production capacity to prevent lead times from increasing.

Natron Energy was founded in 2012 by Colin Wessells, who at the time was a Ph.D. student at Stanford University. Its mission was to develop sodium-ion batteries as a cost-effective sustainable alternative to lithium-ion batteries. In 2020, Natron’s sodium-ion battery became the first to meet the UL 1973 safety standard for energy storage systems, enabling commercial deployment in data centers. According to Wikipedia, Natron began commercial production at its facility in Holland, Michigan, in May 2024.

In August 2024, Natron announced plans for a $1.4 billion gigafactory in Edgecombe County, North Carolina. That factory was expected to create 1,000 jobs and produce 24 gigawatt-hours of sodium-ion batteries annually by 2028. Now here is the important part. The factory was supported by federal incentives provided by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

This week, Natron informed officials in Michigan and North Carolina that it is closing its doors and will cease all operations. “We appreciate our customers and partners support through our journey and this is not how we or anyone at Natron wanted this to end,” said an internal memo sent to all Natron employees and viewed by Politico. The memo added that the company would discontinue operations on September 3, 2025 because of financing challenges.

“While a small team of Natron employees are being retained to shut down Natron in a safe and environmentally responsible manner, none of the commercial team will be retained,” the memo said. “We will not be in a position to deliver on any current or future orders.” The announcement should come as no surprise, considering what happened to the IRA once Pharaoh on the Potomac took over the Offal Office. He ordered his stooges in Congress to gut it as part of the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill.

North Carolina Commerce Secretary Lee Lilley called the announcement a disappointment. “It stood to create 1,000 good paying jobs in a growing industry,” he said in a statement. “It’s unfortunate Natron will not be able to proceed with their plans.” Lilley failed to place the blame squarely where it belongs — on the state’s Congressional delegation.

The OBBB was enthusiastically supported by every Republican member of Congress from North Carolina, including so-called senators Thom Tillis and Ted Budd, and representatives Greg Murphy, Virginia Foxx, Addison McDowell, David Rouzer, Mark Harris, Richard Hudson, Pat Harrigan, Chuck Edwards, Brad Knott, and Tim Moore. If you live in North Carolina and should happen to run into any of these people, be sure to thank them for doing such a great job of making America a third world nation, because North Carolina don’t need no stinking clean energy jobs that pay well and offer good benefits.

The company’s proposed $1.4 billion Edgecombe County facility was expected to be one of the biggest eastern North Carolina economic development deals in recent years, and one of the latest to bolster the state’s roster of clean-energy companies. according to WRAL News. The state had approved an incentives package worth up to $56.3 million for the project, which was projected to grow the state’s economy by more than $3.4 billion over 12 years.

Natron Faced Growing Financial Pressures

Battery Technology offered its insights into the fate of Natron the day the closure notice occurred. It said the financial struggles for Natron “highlight the broader challenges of scaling up innovative technologies. Liquidity concerns plagued the company for months, with many investors freezing scheduled payments.” While Natron had received preliminary clearance from Underwriters Laboratories in 2020, it needed additional certification from UL to get access to the $25 million in orders it had on its books. Making matters worse, the price of lithium-ion batteries continues to fall, putting pressure on alternative battery technologies.

“Natron Energy’s closure serves as a reminder of the challenges faced by companies attempting to scale up innovative technologies,” Battery Technology added. For the energy storage industry, it highlights the need for robust financial backing and strategic planning to navigate the complexities of scaling up.

“Sodium-ion batteries remain a promising alternative; however, overcoming supply chain vulnerabilities and market pressures will be crucial for their widespread adoption. As the energy storage market evolves, coordinated efforts by policy makers and industry leaders will be essential to ensure the competitiveness of sodium-ion technology in the face of growing alternatives like LFP batteries,” the battery news site stated.

Coordinated efforts by policy makers and industry leaders in the era of MAGA? Please be serious. That is not going to happen, and so the US will slide further back in the rear view mirror as China increases its domination of battery technology.

Why Sodium Batteries Are Important

What’s the big deal about sodium-ion batteries, anyway? For one thing, the Natron batteries were going to be manufactured in America using raw materials readily available in the US. That made them fully compliant with the Build American, Buy American act which requires all iron, steel, manufactured products, and construction materials used in federally funded infrastructure projects to be produced in the United States. Clearly that is another piece of “woke” legislation that has been blown up by the failed administration in Washington.

On its website, Natron said the secret to the high performance of its batteries is the use of Prussian blue electrodes. “Prussian blue, when combined with sodium ions, creates a chemistry that delivers super-fast charging and power delivery, with no friction. It’s that lack of friction that enables our batteries to last much longer — over 50,000 cycles. And it creates a battery that’s incapable of thermal runaway, incredibly safe, and made entirely from abundant and readily available resources,” the company said.

As we reported a year ago, sodium has none of the disadvantages associated with lithium. It is abundant, found everywhere around the world, and cheap. Sodium-ion batteries do not have the energy density of the best lithium-ion batteries, but they have some advantages lithium-ion batteries do not. Their performance does not degrade as much as lithium-ion batteries do in cold temperatures, and they have a greatly diminished risk of fire.

“Sodium-ion battery technology is at the beginning of the development curve and is about where lithium-ion technology was a decade or so ago,” we said back then. And indeed, CATL, the largest battery manufacturer in the world, has announced its second generation sodium-ion batteries are already in production and are expected to find their way into energy storage applications shortly as well as automotive use.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/sodium-ion-battery-energy-storage-natron.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 16:07:28.895521

“With or without the tax credit, these improvements bring energy savings that lower energy bills,” he said.","The “one big beautiful bill” that President Donald Trump signed into law in July is set to upend many aspects of American life, including climate policy. The law, which Republicans backed en masse, not only derails the nation’s efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it could also strike a blow to consumers’ pocketbooks.

From a climate perspective, the legislation’s most significant rollbacks are aimed at industries such as renewable energy, not individuals. But there will be very real impacts for taxpayers hoping to decarbonize their homes.

The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, provided tax credits for climate-friendly purchases ranging from heat pumps to solar arrays through 2032. That time frame has been cut to as little as a few months.

“This bill is going to take away a lot of assistance from consumers,” said Lowell Ungar, director of federal policy for the nonprofit American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. He noted that two million people used the home improvement tax credit in its first year alone.

The good news is that the law does not affect the billions of dollars that the IRA already sent to state efficiency and electrification rebate programs, and that much of that money will remain available beyond the federal sunsets. But, Ungar added, the tax credits can still save people thousands of dollars before they vanish.

“If consumers are able to make the investment now,” he said, “it will help them out.”

For those looking to act, Grist shares a roundup of when credits will go away.

Buy an EV before October

New electric vehicles that meet federal domestic manufacturing requirements qualify for a tax credit of up to $7,500. While credits on foreign-made EVs aren’t offered directly to consumers, automakers do get them and often pass the savings along through leases. Used EVs under $25,000 that are purchased at a dealer are also eligible for up to a $4,000 credit.

All of this goes away on September 30. There will be no credits after that. Ultimately, this will make new electric vehicles more expensive and put the technology further out of reach for low- to moderate-income Americans.

The income caps on the EV credits still apply, limiting the benefit on new EVs to those households earning less than $300,000 and on used vehicles to those earning less than $150,000. There is an MSRP limit of $80,000 for new cars, too.

Strangely, the tax credit for installing an EV charger (up to $1,000) runs through June of next year.

Make home improvements by the end of the year

The remarkably vast Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit provides up to $2,000 toward qualified heat pumps, water heaters, biomass stoves, or biomass boilers. It offers another $1,200 toward efficiency upgrades such as insulation, doors, windows, and even home energy audits.

These are going away on December 31. All items must be “placed in service” by then to qualify, though a reminder: Tax credits lower your tax liability but don’t come back as rebates. You must have a tax bill to benefit, which may not be the case for certain low-income households.

Pay for solar this year

The most valuable IRA incentive being axed is the Residential Clean Energy Credit. It covers 30 percent of clean energy systems such as solar panels, wind turbines, and geothermal heat pumps, and there is no cap. With the average cost of a solar system in the U.S. just north of $28,000, that means a tax credit would be worth around $8,500. That credit vanishes at the end of this year, though the law refers to the “expenditures” being made by then, so that could mean paying for — but not necessarily installing — a system by then.

Like with other credits, Ungar suggests confirming any changes with a tax professional. He also said that the potential for higher tariffs is another reason to move quickly. But, he said, even after the credits go away, many of these improvements could still make financial sense over the long term.

“With or without the tax credit, these improvements bring energy savings that lower energy bills,” he said. “In some cases, improvements are going to be a no-brainer regardless.”",https://images.stacker.com/s/720/1280/images/stories/2025/08/05/grist-environmental-tax-credits_0.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 14:04:36.590258

Starting at the end of this month, September 30, 2025, incentives that have supported the growth of EV adoption will come to an abrupt end.

For many consumers, the availability of tax credits and rebates made driving an electric vehicle an enticing option. These incentives have helped reduce the initial cost of purchasing an EV, making it easier to choose cleaner, more sustainable transportation. With the deadline approaching, those considering the switch to electric must act quickly to take advantage of these financial benefits.

The $7,500 Credit That Fueled the Market

Under the previous incentive program, consumers could receive up to $7,500 in tax credits when purchasing a qualifying electric vehicle. This initiative not only sparked interest in eco-friendly cars but also encouraged various manufacturers to invest in EV technology. As a result, the market saw an influx of new models, providing more choices for buyers looking to contribute to a greener future.

What's Changing After September 30th?

With the new bill’s passage, these incentives will no longer exist after September 30th.

This change raises concerns about the future of electric vehicle sales, especially as many individuals may feel pressured to make a decision quickly. The potential loss of financial incentives could significantly impact the pace of EV adoption, which is crucial for addressing climate change and reducing our reliance on fossil fuels.

In response to this development, many automakers are urging consumers to consider the urgency of the situation. They emphasize that purchasing an electric vehicle before the deadline ensures that buyers can capitalize on the remaining incentives while they exist. As the deadline looms, some dealerships may even offer special promotions to entice customers.

Final Weeks to Act

The end of these incentives can be viewed as a double-edged sword. While it acknowledges the progress made in EV adoption, it also creates uncertainty and could slow down the momentum built toward cleaner transportation.

In these final weeks before the incentives disappear, it is essential for consumers to stay informed about their options. Whether you’re contemplating an electric vehicle or supporting policies that promote sustainability, this moment presents an opportunity to reflect on the impact our choices have on the environment and our economy.

As September 30th approaches, those who wish to embrace a greener lifestyle should seize the opportunity while it lasts.

The Trump Administration ratcheted up its war against offshore wind this week, saying in court filings that it intends to revoke the permit of New England Wind, a project planned near the coast of Massachusetts and Rhode Island that would have generated up to 2.6 GW of power.

The administration has targeted at least five different wind projects off the East Coast in various stages of development through stop work orders or moving to revoke permits.

The Danish renewable energy company Ørsted filed a lawsuit this week asking a judge to immediately lift a stop work order the administration issued to its project, Revolution Wind, a 700-MW project off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut that Ørsted says is 80% complete.

Dive Insight:

The Trump administration has offered a variety of theories in different settings for its actions against wind projects, including invoking national security and the safety of marine wildlife. In court filings, wind energy developers have made similar allegations that the administration’s actions are driven by the politics and preferences of President Donald Trump, not substantiated problems with the projects.

Some analysts have warned that the administration’s actions against permitted wind projects could affect energy project financing across the board — not just for wind.

“The current administration is clearly pushing an agenda favoring fossil fuels and nuclear power,” Dennis Wamsted, an analyst with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, wrote in a Sept. 3 post. “But a banker being asked to loan money for such a project — whether a multi-billion-dollar interstate gas pipeline or a new nuclear facility — likely will think hard before lending money to a project that could be stopped at the 11th hour by a future administration.”

Wamsted said the uncertainty around permitting and construction is eroding trust in the federal government and is likely to raise financing costs for some projects.

The Oceantic Network, an offshore wind trade group, said in a statement that the government was undermining a “40-state, $25 billion domestic supply chain while holding American business investments hostage.”

“Halting construction and revoking permits on approved projects after years of thorough agency review will raise electricity prices for millions across the country, jeopardize billions of dollars in private investment, threaten our national shipbuilding, steel, and manufacturing supply chains, and undermine our nation’s energy security,” said Sam Salustro, Oceantic’s senior vice president of policy and market strategy. “This is from a political playbook that should make every industry worry whether they will be targeted by this administration or the next.”

On Thursday, Ørsted filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia seeking emergency injunctive relief and asking the judge to vacate an Aug. 22 stop work order issued by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.

In its complaint, the company said it spent approximately $5 billion and went through a comprehensive review process that spanned three presidential administrations before receiving approval from 15 federal and state agencies. It said it will incur over $1 billion in breakaway costs if the project is cancelled, and said the stop work order meets the Administrative Procedure Act’s standard for an unlawful, arbitrary, and capricious action.

“If unabated, the Stop Work Order will inflict devastating and irreparable harm on Revolution Wind,” the complaint says. “The Stop Work Order also impairs Revolution Wind’s ability to meet its contractual obligations to deliver power pursuant to twenty-year Power Purchase Agreements.”

ISO New England issued a statement last month that expressed concern over the stop work order issued to Revolution Wind, saying, “The ISO is expecting this project to come online and it is included in our analyses of near-term and future grid reliability.”

“Delaying the project will increase risks to reliability,” it said.

Earlier this week, BOEM joined with a group that had been suing it to stop the New England Wind project, asking a judge to issue a new briefing schedule in light of “Federal Defendants’ forthcoming motion for voluntary remand.”

BOEM is “in the process of reconsidering its approval” for the New England Wind project, it said, and plans to “move no later than October 10 to remand and, separately, to vacate BOEM’s [...] approval.”

New England Wind’s developer, Avangrid, had not filed a response as of Thursday, according to the docket.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/iDE5ioa9-qZA3ANBQ3l0rEj-bk0tQd_f5uqAet2_NTI/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9vZmZzaG9yZV93aW5kX1VLLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-09-05 13:05:41.192419

FERC’s ‘brain drain’ Meanwhile, FERC, which is under a hiring freeze, has been losing key staff since Trump was elected, according to agency observers.","This is part of Utility Dive’s ongoing “FERC in Focus” series where we explore trends, challenges and other significant developments affecting the commission.

President Donald Trump is making unprecedented moves to assert control over independent agencies like the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and former commissioners, experts and agency observers say they are watching several key areas to gauge whether the commission will remain independent.

The White House has already moved to favor fossil fuel assets over renewable energy, require agencies to clear decisions with the Office of Management and Budget and include sunset provisions in new regulations. Trump has also shown a willingness to fire or try to remove regulators that run afoul of his preferences, such as he has done with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Federal Reserve.

With two Republican nominees preparing to fill empty seats at FERC, the agency is poised for a shift that could lead to more direct White House influence over the independent agency’s policymaking, said Tyson Slocum, director of Public Citizen’s Energy Program.

“My guess is you’re going to see a pretty tight alignment between FERC’s priorities and the priorities of the White House, and I think that will significantly erode FERC’s historic bipartisan independence and move FERC more into being an arm of the White House,” he said.

Even if the agency maintains its independence, the loss of experts and staff to the administration’s aggressive cuts to the federal workforce could hamper its work, some say.

“The agency is already chronically understaffed and so if you really see additional attrition, it’s going to be much harder for the agency to do complex, hard stuff on top of its bread-and-butter responsibilities and proceedings that really do take up a lot of time,” according to Matt Christiansen, a Wilson Sonsini attorney and former FERC general counsel.

New commissioners, new priorities

So far, FERC does not appear to have changed much since Trump became president in January, according to agency observers. FERC Chairman David Rosner, a Democrat Trump selected to head the agency last month, said the commission is working independently.

“FERC continues to execute our mission to enable reliable and affordable energy for all Americans by implementing the laws passed by Congress, making decisions fairly, efficiently, and independently, and considering the views put forth by all parties,” Rosner said in an email.

However, new faces on the commission could bring about a shift.

Immediately after Trump was inaugurated in late January, he elevated Republican Commissioner Mark Christie to be the agency’s chairman. After Trump declined to ask Christie to serve a second term, he left the agency on Aug. 8.

Earlier this year, Trump named Laura Swett, an energy attorney and former FERC staffer, and David LaCerte, an official with the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, to fill the empty seats.

LaCerte does not appear to have any background in energy. He is listed as a contributor to the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, the conservative blueprint for “dismantling the administrative state” that Trump disowned as a candidate but has since moved to implement.

The nominations must be approved by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee — which was set to hold a confirmation hearing on the nominees on Sept. 4 — and the full Senate, a process that may not be completed until late this year.

Once FERC’s five seats are filled, agency observers expect Trump will name either Swett or LaCerte as chairman, which could lead to changes for the independent agency.

Keeping thermal power plants running

One of the Trump administration’s top energy goals is keeping coal- and gas-fired power plants from retiring, especially when it is challenging to build new gas-fired power plants given siting and permitting hurdles and the time it takes to procure equipment, according to Josh Price, a director on the energy team at Capstone, a research firm.

The U.S. Department of Energy has helped in that goal by issuing “emergency” orders to prevent two power plants in Michigan and Pennsylvania from retiring, Price said, adding that FERC could join the effort after the pending nominees join the agency. The DOE has framed the move as one necessary for reliability, but it is expected to cost utilities more. The owner of one Michigan coal plant said it spent $29 million in just over a month complying with an order to keep it running.

Price said he expects FERC will issue Federal Power Act section 206 orders finding that some markets — maybe all markets — are “unjust and unreasonable” and should be changed because they don’t adequately provide value to the reliability benefits offered by nuclear, gas- and coal-fired power plants.

“It’s prioritizing existing, dispatchable resources, which runs counter to putting downward pressure on prices, which is the administration’s stated goal,” Price said. “But I view that as more rhetoric than a real desire.”

FERC could also favor dispatchable generation in interconnection queues, according to Price. The commission, for example, has approved temporary fast-track interconnection reviews for the PJM Interconnection, the Midcontinent Independent System Operator and the Southwest Power Pool that generally favor dispatchable generation.

“One of the things I’d be interested to see is … to what extent does FERC attempt to make prioritization of dispatchable resources in the queue permanent?” Price asked.

Slocum echoed Price’s assessment.

“I think you’re going to see a much more aggressive push to tweak market structures and market rules to prioritize primarily natural gas generation at the expense of wind and solar,” he said.

Further, FERC’s current commissioners appear to generally support adding gas infrastructure in the U.S., according to Slocum. FERC, for example, in June approved a petition for a waiver sought by the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America without questioning whether Trump’s “energy emergency” — one of INGAA’s justifications for the need for a waiver — is valid, he said.

“There seems to be a consensus agreement at FERC right now that the energy system is in crisis, that renewables are contributing to that crisis, and that we need to take extraordinary steps to promote primarily natural gas generation and pipelines to support natural gas generation as a viable solution to America’s energy challenges,” Slocum said.

Executive orders test FERC’s independence

It’s unclear how much influence the White House will have over FERC, according to Neil Chatterjee, a former FERC chairman nominated by Trump and chief government affairs officer at Palmetto.

One possible scenario is that the White House could start requiring FERC decisions to be vetted by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs and the Office of Management and Budget, he said, which would turn FERC’s chair and commissioners “more into administration staffers than independent commissioners.”

While FERC chairs typically communicate with the White House, there has never been direct oversight of the agency, according to Chatterjee.

“I had full independence to make decisions as I saw fit, that I thought were just and reasonable and will withstand legal scrutiny,” he said. “I never had to clear anything with anybody.”

One of the key barometers for measuring FERC’s independence will be how the agency responds to an executive order that directs FERC, the Environmental Protection Agency and other agencies to add sunset provisions to their energy-related regulations so they would expire within five years, Christiansen said.

Trump ordered the sunset provisions to be in place by Sept. 30. For FERC, the directive covers regulations under the Federal Power Act, the Natural Gas Act and the Power Plant and Industrial Fuel Use Act.

It appears that it may be impossible to comply with the letter of the executive order and the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, which sets the rules for how federal agencies develop and issue regulations, Christiansen said.

If FERC goes through a notice of comment period for regulations the agency wants to continue past the five-year deadline — as outlined in the executive order — that process “would take forever and require a lot of manpower, and it also would leave a lot of regulated entities in limbo,” said Richard Glick, a principal at GQS New Energy Strategies and former FERC chair.

Another concern would be other executive orders that direct independent agencies to clear major activities with OMB, according to Glick. The OMB reports directly to the president and is headed by Russell Vought, a key architect of Project 2025 who has advanced a maximalist view of presidential power.

“FERC has a very long history of being truly independent, meaning that the administration, no matter who’s in charge, doesn’t tell FERC or the commissioners how to vote or what to do on various issues,” Glick said.

Following typical procedure, FERC hasn’t shared documents outside the agency before commissioners vote on them since Christie became commission chairman, he said during a media briefing on July 24.

Another issue that could affect FERC’s independence is the threat of commissioners being fired as has happened at other independent agencies such as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in June, Glick said.

In an unprecedented move, Trump on Aug. 25 released a letter saying he was firing Lisa Cook, a board member of the Federal Reserve, an independent agency that runs the U.S. central banking system.

FERC’s ‘brain drain’

Meanwhile, FERC, which is under a hiring freeze, has been losing key staff since Trump was elected, according to agency observers.

“They’ve already had a fair bit of brain drain — significant losses in the General Counsel’s Office and the policy office — so the agency is increasingly less equipped to execute on a policy agenda, and just even implementing core, nuts and bolts stuff,” said Devin Hartman, director of energy and environmental policy at the R Street Institute.

FERC’s headcount is expected to fall by 9% by the end of its fiscal year, Christie said during the media briefing in mid-April. FERC had a staff of about 1,500 people as of December. The agency didn’t respond to requests for its current headcount.

At the same time FERC is going through organizational changes. The agency is finalizing the details of a reorganization plan required by the Office of Personnel Management and OMB, according to Celeste Miller, FERC’s acting director of media relations.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/441zhZEljaRhzhxt1G95VFw7mLuBqNqYM2KT9pzX3LU/g:nowe:0:0/c:1581:893/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9UcnVtcF9wcmVzc2VyLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-09-05 13:05:45.276055

If you didn’t think President Donald Trump’s attacks on offshore wind could get worse, think again. In just the last week, the administration targeted more already-permitted wind projects, slashed funding for projects tied to offshore wind, and enlisted a wide array of federal departments to go after the industry.

Trump vowed on the first day of his term that ​“we aren’t going to do the wind thing,” and it’s been blow after blow to the sector since. But in the last two weeks, the Trump administration has doubled down on its commitment to crushing offshore wind in particular — and what was already an aggressive campaign has now become an all-out war.

In late August, the Interior Department sent a stop-work order to the Revolution Wind project off the coast of Rhode Island, even though the development is just months away from completion. It echoed a similar — failed — attempt to halt construction of the Empire Wind project off the coast of New York back in April.

New England’s grid operator has since warned that delays will jeopardize power reliability and raise electricity prices, and even fishermen who voted for Trump are urging the administration to let work resume. Developer Ørsted and the states of Rhode Island and Connecticut are now suing the Trump administration to get Revolution Wind construction up and running.

The halt turned out to be just the start of a new wave of attacks. Late last week, the Transportation Department said it would pull $679 million from projects to support offshore wind. That includes about $426 million granted to turn a California port into the country’s first hub for floating offshore wind construction.

Recent federal court filings reveal the administration is also looking to revoke and reconsider permits for three already-approved projects: Maryland Offshore Wind, as well as the SouthCoast Wind and New England Wind projects off Massachusetts.

And now, Trump is expanding his full-court press by calling on federal departments that typically have nothing to do with offshore wind, The New York Times reports. The Health and Human Services Department is apparently researching whether turbines emit harmful electromagnetic waves — a claim multiple studies have debunked. And the Defense Department is looking into whether offshore wind farms pose national security risks, the dubious reason the administration cited when halting Revolution Wind last month.

If it wasn’t clear before, it is now: The Trump administration is going to leave no stone unturned in its attempt to stop offshore wind in America.

Court OKs green bank termination

The Trump administration scored a significant, but potentially temporary, win in its efforts to claw back billions of dollars meant to bring clean energy to communities nationwide. A federal appeals court decided on Tuesday that the U.S. EPA has the authority to cancel awards under the $20 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.

The ​“green bank” program, created by the Inflation Reduction Act, is supposed to provide low-interest loans for emissions-reducing projects in low-income and disadvantaged communities. The EPA moved early in Trump’s presidency to revoke the funds, which had already been awarded to the nonprofits administering the program, and the money has been frozen in Citibank accounts ever since. Still, it’s not the end of the line: The nonprofits indicate they’ll appeal the decision further.

What utilities can learn from the data center capital of the world

As tech giants continue to build data centers, utilities will have to figure out how to meet growing electricity demand without raising power prices and carbon emissions. And in Virginia, Dominion Energy might be showing them what not to do, experts and advocates tell Canary Media’s Elizabeth Ouzts. The utility has already gotten regulators to approve its plan to build a raft of new fossil-fueled plants over the next 15 years, despite a state law requiring the total phaseout of fossil fuel power by 2045.

Dominion isn’t in an enviable position, to be sure, as no utility can be sure of whether the data center power boom will fully come to fruition. But utilities can still turn to efficiency measures, battery storage, and grid-enhancing technologies to cut their need to add more power, and data centers can be flexible with their power usage to avoid overwhelming the grid.

“For fleet operators and transport companies, the ability to reserve charging sessions in advance means that e-trucks can be reliably integrated into tight schedules,” the company explains. “At the same time, charging infrastructure operators—both in the public domain and at depots—benefit from improved capacity management of their charging points.”

The introduction of reservation functions requires seamless interaction among various software systems, including transport management systems (TMS), energy management systems (EMS) and charge point management systems (CPMS). FRYTE’s modular cloud ecosystem enables communication between TMS and CPMS, based on the new OCPI standard 2.3.

At the reservation demonstration during the recent Interchange Network Conference in Berlin, Hubject acted as a reservation hub, SBRS as a CPO, and Bosch Road Services as a booking service provider, while FRYTE provided the integration module to connect the TMS systems.

“Charging point reservation solves two central challenges,” said Maximilian Zähringer, CEO of FRYTE. “When implemented correctly, it ensures reliable operation of e-trucks for fleet operators and, at the same time, a secure and predictable utilization of charging infrastructure for operators. Interoperability is key to enabling automated booking directly from transport management.”

“We are transforming all relevant Fiege logistics sites into energy ecosystems,” said Hartmut Entrup, Director of Energy Solutions at Fiege Logistik. “Optimizing energy flows and costs is therefore one of our most important tasks.

What do recent legislative changes mean for behind-the-meter solar?

For business leaders in New Hampshire, behind-the-meter solar remains a powerful tool in responding to both growing energy demand and long-term cost stability, even in the face of recent legislative challenges. While federal and state-level changes have created headwinds for renewable energy projects, particularly through shifting tariffs and evolving tax credit rules, the fundamental market drivers remain unchanged. Solar energy continues to be the fastest to deploy and the most cost-effective source of new electricity generation available today. That fact becomes even more compelling as the state experiences increased demand from data centers, electrification and population growth.

How can Norwich Technologies help companies that still want the benefits of solar?

Norwich Technologies, an independent Vermont-based company founded in 2011 and operating throughout northern New England, including New Hampshire, has transitioned from residential to community- and utility-scale solar over the past decade. We are now employing 45 full-time professionals. Our team has successfully developed and commissioned nearly 50 distributed energy projects in just the last three years, demonstrating that sustained progress is not only possible but expected, regardless of policy uncertainty.

The post-Inflation Reduction Act boom sparked a wave of solar development, and we’ve been planning proactively for the 2026–28 window. With market conditions now in flux, we’re taking strategic steps to “safe harbor” projects, initiating construction on qualifying systems to ensure they meet federal guidelines for existing incentive timelines. This isn’t new territory for us. Having navigated previous regulatory shifts, our vertically integrated model gives us the agility to respond quickly and effectively.

NT operates with specialized yet interdependent divisions — Breakaway Renewables for development and finance, Norwich Solar for EPC (engineering, procurement and construction), and RunTime Solar for long-term operations and maintenance. This structure enables us to maintain strong pipelines while also building reliable long-term revenue streams for our partners and clients.

What is the future of solar for New Hampshire businesses?

For New Hampshire businesses, the message is clear: The solar sector is evolving, not retreating. Even as uncertainty persists, the opportunity to lock in low-cost, locally generated power is real and growing. With trusted partners and resilient planning, solar energy can continue to be a cornerstone of smart business strategy and a powerful force for energy independence in the Granite State.

David Pickens, Director of NG Sales, Sprague Energy

Why are electricity supply rates in New England higher than in many other states?

Electricity costs generally fall into two categories: delivery costs and commodity costs. Delivery costs are the expenses of maintaining and upgrading the transmission and distribution system that brings power to your business. Commodity costs are the costs of procuring or generating the electricity itself.

In New England, both sides of the equation can add upward pressure on prices. On the delivery side, transmission constraints and seasonal demand swings — particularly winter natural gas pipeline constraints, since natural gas fuels a sizable portion of New England’s electricity — can contribute to higher prices during certain periods. On the energy commodity side, public policy requirements, such as renewable portfolio standards requiring an increasing share of energy generated by renewable energy sources, and other decarbonization initiatives, also influence costs.

Taken together, these regional and policy dynamics help explain why electricity rates in New England often trend higher than in many other parts of the country.

How do grid demands factor into the cost of energy, and what should New Hampshire businesses be paying attention to?

The price of electricity isn’t just about how much is consumed; it’s also about when it is consumed. An energy bill is typically made up of both energy charges and demand charges. During peak periods, those demand charges can increase, and businesses that use the most energy at those times may see a greater impact on their costs.

Understanding these dynamics can help companies identify opportunities to reduce exposure, whether by lowering demand during peak periods, improving efficiency, or exploring contract structures and energy management strategies that better align with their usage patterns.

With electricity rates in New Hampshire rising sharply this summer, what can businesses do right now to protect themselves from these increases?

Businesses are not locked into their utility’s default service rates. In New Hampshire’s deregulated energy market, companies have the ability to choose their energy supplier. By reviewing supplier options, businesses can take greater control of their costs instead of being fully exposed to rate hikes.

What does Sprague offer and how would those services benefit commercial customers?

Sprague offers customized energy solutions across natural gas, electricity, refined products, solar, and materials handling. In New Hampshire’s deregulated market, businesses can choose their energy supplier, and we work closely with our customers to build a strategy that fits their goals, whether that means gaining budget certainty, managing costs or sourcing electricity from suppliers who generate power through renewable resources.

Energy decisions often feel overwhelming. How can businesses cut through the complexity?

Energy markets are complex, and every decision about supply has ripple effects on cost, risk and sustainability. That’s why having an experienced advisor matters. With more than 155 years of energy expertise, Sprague helps businesses see the system clearly — evaluating supplier options, renewable mixes and contract structures — so businesses can make informed choices with confidence.

What should business leaders keep in mind as they prepare for the future of energy in New Hampshire?",https://www.nhbr.com/content/uploads/2025/09/h/p/adobestock-484948621-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-09-05 13:06:29.388194

“Fuel is the most important factor in bringing advanced nuclear energy to market,” said Jacob DeWitte, Oklo co-founder and CEO.
Tennessee is showing the nation that recycling can be done to support new nuclear development and growth.” The recycling facility will recover usable fuel material from used nuclear fuel and fabricate it into fuel for advanced reactors.
“This historic location decision validates our community’s commitment to nuclear energy, made possible only because of the extensive environmental cleanup efforts of the Department of Energy’s Office of Environmental Management and its contractor, UCOR.
Oklo’s presence in the Oak Ridge Corridor is proof that we are successfully completing ‘cleanup today for a nuclear tomorrow.’”","Oklo Inc. plans to invest up to $1.68 billion to design, build, and operate a nuclear fuel recycling facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The initial investment will build a facility to recycle used nuclear fuel into fuel for fast reactors like Oklo’s Aurora powerhouse, and will be the first of its kind in the U.S. Oklo expects to create more than 800 jobs at the advanced nuclear fuel recycling facility, to be located on a 247-acre site at the Oak Ridge Heritage Center.

Oklo is exploring opportunities with the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to recycle the utility’s used fuel at the new facility and to evaluate potential power sales from future Oklo powerhouses in the region to TVA. This collaboration would mark the first time a U.S. utility has explored recycling its used fuel into clean electricity using modern electrochemical processes, turning a legacy liability into a resource while creating a secure fuel supply for the future.

“Fuel is the most important factor in bringing advanced nuclear energy to market,” said Jacob DeWitte, Oklo co-founder and CEO. “By recycling used fuel at scale, we are turning waste into gigawatts, reducing costs, and establishing a secure U.S. supply chain that will support the deployment of clean, reliable, and affordable power. Tennessee is showing the nation that recycling can be done to support new nuclear development and growth.”

The recycling facility will recover usable fuel material from used nuclear fuel and fabricate it into fuel for advanced reactors. This process can reduce waste volumes for more economical, clean, and efficient disposal pathways.

“Tennessee is the core of America’s nuclear renaissance,” said Don Moul, president and CEO, TVA. “Under Governor Lee’s leadership, the state is leading the way in attracting the companies that will build America’s energy future. Oklo’s announcement will ensure these innovative nuclear technologies are built and developed in our backyard. TVA is proud to support Oklo’s work to develop the next-generation of nuclear technologies needed to power AI-infrastructure and drive economic growth.”

The Oak Ridge facility is expected to begin producing metal fuel for Aurora powerhouses by the early 2030s, following regulatory review and approvals.

Tennessee’s Nuclear Energy Fund Fuels Growth

Oklo is the fifth company to locate in Tennessee utilizing the Nuclear Energy Fund, which assists nuclear power-related businesses choosing to relocate or grow in the state and supports the state’s universities and research institutions in further developing their nuclear education programs. The $50 million fund was included in Governor Bill Lee’s recommended 2023-2024 budget and approved by the Tennessee General Assembly. An additional $20 million was allocated and approved in the state’s budget during both the 2024 and 2025 legislative sessions.

“Our administration created the Nuclear Energy Fund in partnership with the Tennessee General Assembly to support and expand the state’s nuclear ecosystem, and Oklo’s recognition of our strong business climate, reliable infrastructure and skilled workforce prove that Tennessee is ready to continue growing into the top state for nuclear energy,” commented Gov. Lee. “We’re proud to partner with Oklo to continue pushing our state toward the future, increasing America’s energy independence and creating greater opportunity for all Tennesseans.”

The project was vetted and recommended by the Education and Workforce subgroup, part of the 22-member Tennessee Nuclear Energy Advisory Council.

“Today’s announcement marks another significant milestone for our state in becoming a leader for clean and reliable energy,” said Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development (TNECD) Commissioner Stuart C. McWhorter. “With assets like Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), a rich history in the nuclear industry and leadership that stands ready to support Oklo’s next steps, we know Tennessee is the ideal location for this project and the company’s continued nuclear efforts. We look forward to seeing the incredible impact this project has, and we’re grateful to welcome Oklo to the Tennessee family.”

“Roane County is proud to be the new home of Oklo,” commented Roane County Executive Mayor Wade Creswell. “This historic location decision validates our community’s commitment to nuclear energy, made possible only because of the extensive environmental cleanup efforts of the Department of Energy’s Office of Environmental Management and its contractor, UCOR.

But concurring opinions suggested that plaintiffs should head to the Court of Federal Claims.
By concocting any reason to insulate the administration from accountability, conservative judges are proving themselves just as dangerous.","On Tuesday, a divided panel of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals allowed the Trump administration to proceed with its unilateral termination of roughly $20 billion in congressionally appropriated grants awarded to nonprofits to fight climate change. A district court had previously blocked the cuts, concluding they likely violated the Constitution and the Administrative Procedure Act. But in Climate United Fund v. Citibank, two Trump-appointed federal judges determined that it wasn’t their place to say whether the terminations are legal or not. Because the nonprofits’ claims are “essentially contractual,” wrote Judge Neomi Rao, joined by Judge Gregory Katsas, the nonprofits would have to bring their lawsuits in the Court of Federal Claims instead.

This standard appeared in a dissent that Justice Samuel Alito wrote six months ago. Since then, it has gone on a seemingly implausible journey, reappearing in two Supreme Court shadow docket orders before finally arriving at the D.C. Circuit as, apparently, governing law. By canceling the grants, the Trump administration is again seizing powers that the Constitution never gave it in order to shape all government functions around the president’s prerogatives. The D.C. Circuit’s decision in Climate United Fund v. Citibank shows how conservative judges are constructing a pseudolegal shelter for these brazenly illegal acts.

As a result, it seems, unless and until grantees win some kind of relief in the Court of Federal Claims, the Trump administration can keep frustrating the will of Congress—and sabotaging important work to reduce the risks of climate change.

The grants at issue in this case stem from the Inflation Reduction Act, a federal law passed in 2022 that authorized the Environmental Protection Agency to provide financing and technical assistance for certain climate and clean energy projects. The EPA began distributing the funds last year, but in January 2025, President Donald Trump appointed a new EPA Administrator, Lee Zeldin. In early February, Zeldin derided the grants as “criminal” and a “scheme” by the “Biden EPA,” and directed the Department of Justice to investigate. A couple of weeks later, veteran federal prosecutor Denise Cheung was forced to resign by Ed Martin, the interim U.S. Attorney in Washington, D.C., because she refused his directions to open criminal investigations and freeze grantees’ bank accounts. (The administration found someone they could bully into freezing the funds some time after that.)

In March, five grant recipients filed a lawsuit in order to regain access to the funds to which they were legally entitled. A month later, a lower court ordered the EPA to continue funding the grants as the case was ongoing. Trump immediately requested and received a pause on the order from the D.C. Circuit. Now the D.C. Circuit has vacated the order entirely, relying on the theory from Alito’s dissent in Department of State v. AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition. In that case, too, the Trump administration wanted to vacate a lower court order that directed it to release congressionally-appropriated funds. But there, the Court refused.

Alito was aghast—“stunned,” as he put it in his dissent, which was joined by Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett Kavanaugh. “Does a single district-court judge who likely lacks jurisdiction have the unchecked power to compel the Government of the United States to pay out (and probably lose forever) 2 billion taxpayer dollars?” he asked. The answer to that question, Alito said, should be “an emphatic no.” As for why the district court likely lacked jurisdiction, Alito said that the lower court didn’t account for “our previous suggestion” that the correct way for plaintiffs to try to recover funding “may be to seek specific sums already calculated and past due in the Court of Federal Claims.”

That “suggestion” Alito referenced can be found in a footnote in Bowen v. Massachusetts, a 1988 Supreme Court decision that, remarkably, stands for the exact opposite of what Alito says. In that case, states sued the Department of Health and Human Services for refusing to reimburse them for a category of Medicaid expenditures, and the administration argued that the district court had no jurisdiction because the states must go through the Court of Federal Claims. The Supreme Court called the administration’s argument a “novel proposition” that “must be rejected”: As Justice John Paul Stevens explained for the six-justice majority, the states weren’t seeking money damages as compensation for the government failing to pay funds as mandated. Rather, they were “seeking to enforce the statutory mandate itself, which happens to be one for the payment of money.”

By April, though, a majority of the Court was more sympathetic to Alito’s dissent. In Department of Education v. California, the Court lifted a lower court order that blocked the administration’s termination of several education-related grants. According to the Court, the administration would likely be able to prove that the district court lacked jurisdiction, because federal law “grants the Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction over suits based on any express or implied contract with the United States.” The majority did not elaborate further; the whole order is all of four paragraphs.

Finally, April’s shadow docket suggestion became a plain statement of law in August. Two weeks ago, in National Institutes of Health v. American Public Health Association, the Supreme Court lifted a lower court order that blocked the administration’s termination of nearly $800 million in research grants. There, the Court declared, with only a cite to Department of Education and no further explanation, that the Administrative Procedure Act did not give the district court “jurisdiction to adjudicate claims based on the research-related grants or to order relief designed to enforce any obligation to pay money pursuant to those grants.” The four-paragraph order neglected to mention which court, if any, did have jurisdiction. But concurring opinions suggested that plaintiffs should head to the Court of Federal Claims.

When the Court decided Department of Education, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson criticized it as “equal parts unprincipled and unfortunate.” A few months later, in her NIH v. APHA dissent, Jackson said the Court’s decision turned out to be “an even bigger mistake than I realized,” since it “apparently governs all APA challenges to grant-funding determinations that the Government asks us to address in the context of an emergency stay application.”

This paper-thin reasoning has already had sweeping practical consequences. In NIH, it meant shielding the administration from a legal challenge after it cut off hundreds of millions of dollars Congress allocated to life-saving biomedical research. In Climate United Fund, it meant protecting the administration again after it nullified congressional investment in climate projects. The Trump administration’s grant terminations threaten both public health and democracy.

Key themes throughout the hearing included, among other things, questions about maintaining the independence of FERC, FERC’s generation-agnostic approach to regulation, and the growing demand for and rising cost of electricity.

Both nominees received questions about maintaining the independence of FERC and the FERC commissioners, particularly considering the challenge and potential narrowing by the Supreme Court of Humphrey's Executor v. United States, the 1935 decision that limits the President’s power to remove officials from independent regulatory agencies, like FERC.

While LaCerte said he would “personally welcome” a change to the Humphrey decision, both LaCerte and Swett emphasized their intention to follow the law, with LaCerte highlighting his previous experience at an independent agency and Swett noting that Congress created FERC to be independent and outside the jurisdiction of the Department of Energy.

Committee Democrats closely scrutinized LaCerte’s qualifications to serve as a FERC Commissioner. LaCerte emphasized that he has experience working at an independent agency and an energy law firm, but he also noted that he would bring a “fresh” perspective to the role if he is confirmed.

Several senators asked the nominees if they intend to maintain FERC’s existing generation-agnostic approach to regulation, with both emphasizing their intention to follow the law and to focus on FERC’s mission to ensure rates are just and reasonable.

Senators on both sides of the aisle highlighted the rapidly growing demand for electricity, particularly from data centers and AI. Several also noted recent increases in household electricity bills.

Swett agreed that the country needs more generation and more reliable generation, stating that she would do everything within the law to ensure a plentiful supply of energy at just and reasonable rates.

LaCerte said when decisions come before FERC, he would ask, “Does this make our grid more reliable? Does it make it more affordable?” If the answers are no, then it is necessary to ask why these decisions are being considered.

Both nominees agreed that more transmission is necessary for meeting demand growth and that interstate transmission, when properly planned and executed, can increase reliability.

Swett answered a question about grid-enhancing technologies (GETs), stating that she understands the benefits and agrees that we should maximize the existing grid. She noted that transmission incentives, including those for GETs, have been a challenging issue for FERC for many years, and if confirmed, she will thoroughly examine this issue.

In a question about landowners’ rights, Swett noted that FERC has very limited siting authority, only in DOE-designated corridors, and that she believes landowner rights are very important.

LaCerte said that, in general, it needs to be easier to do business with the federal government to attract more investors to the table to invest in our infrastructure, including transmission.",https://www.publicpower.org/themes/custom/appa_foundation/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-05 13:06:41.386222

These include complete misrepresentations of Dr. Ben Santer’s climate fingerprinting research (full disclosure, Dr. Santer is a UCS Board member); incorrect citation of data related to sea ice to imply Arctic sea ice has declined by 5% since 1980, when in fact it has decreased by ~40%; and an incorrect statement that the area burned by wildfires in the U.S. has not increased since 2007 when in fact the 10-year average burn rate was approximately 5.86 million acres in 2007 and in 2024, it increased to about 7 million acres.

The DOE report cherry-picks text, data, and studies that paint an incomplete picture. For example, the report selectively chooses five tidal gauges and vertical land motion measurements to suggest rising sea-levels in the US are only due to land-sinking, ignoring satellite altimetry observations that clearly show the acceleration of sea-level rise due to thermal expansion of oceans and the melting of land-based ice which are linked to climate change. These findings are clear from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC’s) Sixth assessment report and from the U.S. Fifth National Climate Assessment.

The DOE report employs deceptive framing to downplay climate change harms. As one example of this: The report focuses on absolute numbers of heat vs. cold mortalities, despite risks from heat-related mortalities rapidly rising due to climate change, and the fact that adaptation measures like air-conditioning have clear limitations.

The DOE report was drafted via an improper process. DOE Secretary Wright hand-picked five known climate contrarians to form a Climate Working Group (CWG) that convened secretly and without any public transparency of their work to draft a report that was designed to deliver a biased outcome. Under FACA, Congress mandated transparency in the establishment and operation of any federal advisory committee, including by requiring that the group’s formation be promptly disclosed and that its meetings, emails, and other records be open to the public. Meanwhile, the very existence of the CWG was not revealed until months into its work and there were no public meetings or records of its work.

As a result of these (and additional) significant flaws in content and process, in our comments we call for the DOE to withdraw this report. We also oppose its use to inform any agency rulemakings, including the EPA’s efforts to repeal the Endangerment Finding. If the DOE and the EPA are genuinely interested in an assessment of the latest climate science, they should turn to credible and trustworthy scientific sources such as the U.S. National Climate Assessments and the reports of the IPCC. The National Academy of Sciences has also launched a fast-track report on the latest climate science that is forthcoming. Finally, we urge the Trump administration to stop its broadside assaults on science and science-based policymaking.

Scientific facts should inform policy

UCS is one of many groups, including a group of 85 scientists and a group of 20+ senior national security leaders, that have called out the significant shortcomings in this report. We are alarmed to see climate science denial and disinformation in an official US government document. In many cases, this echoes long-debunked talking points from the fossil fuel industry.

People across the United States deserve and need better from our government. The evidence of the climate crisis is acutely obvious around us—including through climate-fueled extreme weather, accelerating sea level rise, and threats to lives, livelihoods and ecosystems. To deny that is cruel, contrary to climate justice, and a shameful abdication of responsibility. We need solutions, not further lies and attempts to delay action. The overwhelming benefits of a rapid transition to clean energy and to a more climate-resilient world are staring us in the face.",https://blog.ucs.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Chris-Wright-US-DOE.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 13:06:12.055305

That’s why it’s important to understand it as a resurrection of trickle-down economics to support a fossil fuel industry agenda.","One of the Trump administration’s top priorities has been its devastating, unilateral rollback of renewable energy projects and environmental regulations — and a corresponding, aggressive push for fossil fuel interests.

But to hear a growing chorus of “abundance” proponents tell it, the real obstacle to climate progress is environmental regulation itself.

In a disturbing trend, influential politicians and commentators are propagating the idea that U.S. environmental regulation is too stringent, which they blame for stalling worthwhile progress in all sorts of key realms, from housing to mass transit to renewable energy projects. Proponents of this worldview loosely refer to their agenda as “abundance,” which they say characterizes the techno-utopia we can build if we eliminate regulatory constraints.

As an illustration, organizers of the “Abundance” conference taking place this week in Washington, D.C., describe the “abundance” movement as “a cross-partisan coalition committed to accelerating economic growth, reinforcing American leadership in science and technology, dismantling bureaucratic inertia, restoring effective governance, and reducing the cost of living.”

There are many unfounded ideological assumptions in this statement. Is “bureaucratic inertia” a significant obstacle to desirable outcomes in energy, housing, transportation, or any other sector? Does “restoring effective governance” entail less regulation, necessarily? Is “reducing the cost of living” the single most important thing we can do to relieve the serious economic hardship that many people face today? The “abundance” lobby wants us to believe that the answer to each of these questions is “yes.”

This argument isn’t just being made by polluting industries and their supporters, but also by people supposedly concerned about mitigating climate change. They claim that environmental regulations are getting in the way of building renewable energy capacity quickly (although a great many of these critics are not specialists in environmental policy.) One approving reviewer of Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson’s book Abundance, for example, claims that the “biggest thing blocking the greening of American energy” has been “progressive environmental laws that have allowed NIMBYs to sue solar plants and transmission lines into oblivion,” asserting this as the truth without a shred of evidence.

In the recent past, this idea was referred to as “permitting reform” and primarily associated with fossil fuel backers like former Sen. Joe Manchin (D-West Virginia). Now it’s gotten a rebrand. Whatever you call it, the justification for a deregulatory “abundance” agenda is flat-out wrong. But like many bad ideas with powerful backers, it could still become conventional wisdom unless it’s aggressively dispelled.

What’s Actually Blocking Renewable Energy?

The “abundance” lobby cites only anecdotal evidence, such as the long delays and cost overruns for high-speed rail construction in California, to support their claim of regulations choking the growth of renewable energy and clean transportation. Data and peer-reviewed studies tell a different story.

At a logistical level, the wait time for new generation capacity to connect to the grid — known as the interconnection queue — is the main obstacle to bringing renewable energy online. In practice, what this means is that permitted (and sometimes fully built) solar and wind generation and energy storage projects have to wait for years for permission to connect to the grid. In 2023, the electric generation and storage capacity waiting in the interconnection queue was more than twice the installed generation capacity in the U.S.

What’s more, the capacity in the interconnection queue was overwhelmingly wind and solar generation and energy storage, while the existing capacity was dominated by fossil energy. This problem can be fixed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) directing regional grid operators to connect renewable energy to the grid quickly — in other words, more regulation.

A peer-reviewed study has shown that most delays in permitting under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) are attributable to budgetary constraints limiting the ability of permitting agencies to hire sufficient numbers of qualified staff (sometimes because of spending cuts by Congress), and staff turnover at permitting agencies (where qualified staff reviewing a project sometimes leave the agency before the review is complete), along with project backers failing to get key information to permitting agencies — not to the stringency of the NEPA permitting process. Another peer-reviewed study concluded that the vast majority of renewable energy projects are already subject to streamlined procedures, or not subject to federal permitting review at all.

This isn’t to say that stories of renewable projects getting tied up with bureaucratic delays are untrue. But to use them as an argument for weakening environmental review is like using the proliferation of online hate and misinformation to justify curbs on legitimate free speech. Procedural protections exist for a reason, and it’s a terrible idea to weaken them just because bad faith players sometimes misuse them.

Curiously, “abundance” proponents are largely not advancing proposals to speed up permitting of renewable energy exclusively while limiting or banning fossil fuels. Instead, it appears they want to weaken environmental regulation period.

But if more fossil fuel infrastructure is built as a consequence of weakening environmental review, the earth’s climate is cooked. This is basic math. If the U.S. keeps expanding its fossil fuel production, these fuels will keep emitting greenhouse gases when burned. Even if domestic fossil fuel use is rapidly replaced with renewables, the excess oil and gas produced will be exported to emit greenhouse gases somewhere else.

But “abundance” advocates have not made opposing new fossil fuel infrastructure a core plank of their agenda, raising the possibility that their professed concern for climate mitigation may be disingenuous.

Justice Denied

Strikingly missing from the “abundance” agenda is any serious consideration of justice.

Twenty-one percent of income in the U.S. goes to the top 1 percent of earners, while the bottom half of income earners receive only 13 percent. The wealthiest 10 percent of households own more than two-thirds of wealth in the U.S., while the bottom half of households by wealth own only 2.5 percent. The racial wealth gap is striking, with Black families twice as likely as white families to have a net wealth of zero.

In this context, attributing the inability of large numbers of people to access basic necessities like electricity or heating to physical shortages — instead of to poverty and extreme inequality — is naive at best.

We have a serious energy poverty problem in the U.S., with 27 percent of all households experiencing difficulty paying their energy bills. These numbers go up to 52 percent for Black and Indigenous households, and 57 percent for households with an annual income below $10,000.

However, the U.S. produces more oil and gas than needed to meet domestic demand, and is a net exporter. Likewise, we generate enough electricity to meet demand, and our electric grid is highly reliable. Increasing supply is not going to solve a problem rooted in economic and racial inequality.

A large body of peer-reviewed scientific studies have demonstrated how communities have been treated as sacrifice zones for the benefit of polluting industries, on the basis of race and class. Weakening environmental regulations will worsen these disparities, by robbing communities of the few legal protections they have from polluting industry. A mentality solely focused on rapidly scaling upwards — without any regard for expanding environmental justice — will only exacerbate these inequalities.

The Same Old Bad Ideas

For all of the attention it’s received, “abundance” is hardly a new idea. It combines two bad ideas from the past, presented in a shiny new package.

One is “all of the above” energy policy, the official (and dangerously wrong) Obama energy doctrine. Every credible analysis shows that in order to avert climate catastrophe, it’s imperative to phase out fossil fuel production even as we expand renewable energy.

The other bad idea embodied in abundance is trickle-down economics: ignore inequality and expand the economic pie, and people at the bottom will benefit. That’s why “abundance” advocates insist on expanding supply instead of addressing distribution. Decades of experience with trickle-down economics shows that it makes the rich richer at the expense of the rest of us.

The notion of “abundance” has superficial appeal, even to unsuspecting progressives. It invokes job creation, higher material living standards for all, and mitigating climate change by building more renewable energy. That’s why it’s important to understand it as a resurrection of trickle-down economics to support a fossil fuel industry agenda.

Progressives must fight for a very different agenda to solve real-world problems of poverty, climate change, and scarcity of affordable housing, clean transportation, and health care. Unlike the “abundance” vision, the progressive agenda needs to be community-driven and not top-down. We must wrest power from the wealthy and powerful interests who are the real reason why we can’t have good things, acting together to confront the fossil fuel industry, Wall Street banks, health insurers, and corrupt government officials who side with these industries instead of the public interest.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2203457238-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 12:12:55.362846

According to sources cited by CBC Canada on Friday, the plan that requires automakers to reach 20% of zero-emission vehicle sales by 2026, progressing towards 100% in 2035, will be paused for 60 days.

The move is one of the several measures that Prime Minister Mark Carney’s government is announcing to help automakers navigate the tariff climate, as the US implements country-specific tariffs on imports.

Earlier this year, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said that auto parts under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) “will not carry tariffs, no change in that approach,” despite the 25% tariff already imposed on auto parts.

Auto parts that meet USMCA rules don’t have to pay the 25% tariff.

However, Canadian-manufactured vehicles that don’t qualify for duty-free trade under USMCA had their tariff raised from 25% to 35%.

Several US automakers rely on production in Canada, like Detroit automakers General Motors and Ford.

GM currently builds 52% of its vehicles sold in the US at domestic facilities, while 30% come from Canada and Mexico and 18% from other regions. Ford’s US production stands at 77%, with 21% sourced from Canada and Mexico and 2% from other regions.

In May, Reuters reported that production in GM’s Oshawa assembly plant had been cut back due to low demand and trade-related issues.

Carney, who became Prime Minister in March, is reversing several policies from the Trudeau Administration, most of them due to the trade war that broke out in the past few months.

He has removed many retaliatory tariffs on US products and canceled a new tax on digital services after former President Trump objected to it.

Carney also eliminated the carbon tax on consumers’ fossil fuel use. Meanwhile, the auto industry has been lobbying for months against the EV mandate, claiming the targets are unrealistic and could threaten jobs.

Republicans in Congress, alongside President Trump, delivered a transformative piece of legislation last month on America’s 249th anniversary. I refer, of course, to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act – the largest Working Families Tax Cut package in American history.

I am of the camp that Americans deserve lower taxes and less government in their lives, and at the heart of the Working Families Tax Cut are critical tax reforms that deliver on that belief. This bill is a massive win for hardworking Texans and will help foster an economy that is pro-growth, pro-worker, pro-family, pro-business, and pro-energy.

Arguably, the most impactful victory of this bill is the permanent extension of the 2017 Trump tax cuts. Without this, over 475,000 taxpayers in Texas’s 11th Congressional District would have faced a devastating 26% tax increase – the largest in American history. This alone protects middle-class families, small businesses, and workers from a crushing financial blow, but it doesn’t stop there.

Seniors in Texas, 88% of whom receive Social Security benefits, will now pay zero taxes on those benefits. Hourly workers will also keep more of what they earn, with overtime pay, tips, and even interest on car loans for new American-made vehicles being exempt from taxation up to generous limits. This will put thousands of dollars back in the pockets of hardworking Texans.

Families will see additional support through an expanded Child Tax Credit of up to $2,200 per child, which will help offset today’s rising costs of raising a family. For Texans looking to grow their family through adoption, this bill improves the Adoption Tax Credit by making up to $5,000 of it refundable – easing the financial burden that can unfortunately prevent families from adopting.

To help parents plan ahead and start saving early for their children’s future, this bill also establishes Trump Savings Accounts. These accounts will allow parents, family members, or employers to contribute up to $5,000 annually. These funds can later be used for educational opportunities, home ownership, and other essential life investments.

This legislation also supports school choice by encouraging donations to scholarship funds, which will expand educational opportunities for every child in Texas, regardless of their ZIP code.

Rural communities also stand to gain. A higher death tax exemption ensures that the more than two million family farms nationwide are protected from the crippling double taxation that far too often forces families to sell the land when passed from one generation to the next.

Texas businesses and energy producers win big, too. This bill makes the 199A small business deduction permanent at 20%, which is a vital lifeline for Texas entrepreneurs to feasibly launch a business. It also broadens tax breaks for research and equipment purchases, encouraging Made-in-America investments and creating thousands of jobs across several industries.

Additionally, the Biden Administration’s “Green New Scam” tax credits totaling $500 billion will be repealed. These misguided subsidies hindered America’s energy sector and threw taxpayer dollars down the drain. This legislation also eliminates the natural gas tax – delivering certainty to American energy producers, preserving energy jobs, and incentivizing domestic production that will ultimately lead to lower costs for American consumers.

With all the misinformation circulating, it is imperative to separate fact from fiction. The Working Families Tax Cut is a clear response to what the American people demanded in November: rein in wasteful spending, grow the economy, and make life genuinely affordable again.

Nothing is perfect, but this legislation delivers historic, tangible wins for Texans. I am excited about this bill, and all of Texas-11 should be, too.

The Canadian government will be announcing later on Friday that it will delay the EV sales mandate, sources with knowledge of the plans to prop up industries hit by the trade war told Bloomberg.

The previous government of Justin Trudeau enacted many policies to mandate cleaner energy and tax fossil fuels, but Carney’s cabinet is now rolling back some of these, to protect jobs and the industry during the Trump Administration’s trade blitz.

Canada will now announce it will launch a review of the “electric vehicle availability standard” to see that the EV mandate policy does not burden car manufacturers, which have been suffering from the U.S. tariffs.

Under Trudeau’s Electric Vehicle Availability Standard, auto manufacturers and importers must meet annual zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) regulated sales targets. The targets begin for the 2026 model year, and at least 20% of new light-duty vehicles offered for sale in that year should be zero emission. The requirements increase annually to 60% by 2030 and 100% by 2035.

In July, the associations representing automakers and car dealers welcomed the announcement of consultations between the province of Quebec and the auto industry, aimed at adapting the Zero-Emission Vehicle (ZEV) standard to the new realities of the market.

“The auto industry reaffirms its commitment to the energy transition, while calling for a pragmatic approach based on current economic and commercial conditions,” the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers’ Association (CVMA) and Global Automakers of Canada (GAC) said.

“Falling demand for ZEVs exacerbated by US tariffs, a slowing economy, and counterproductive government policies have made Quebec’s ZEV sales targets impossible to achieve,” commented CVMA President and CEO Brian Kingston.

“The province needs to urgently review its targets before doing irreversible damage to the sector that will put thousands of jobs at risk”.

Fewer and fewer Canadian consumers are considering buying an electric vehicle as their next car, an AutoTrader survey showed earlier this year.

For the third consecutive year, the share of Canadians who would buy an EV has dropped. This year’s survey found that 42% of respondents say they would be considering an EV as their next vehicle, down from 46% in 2024, and down from a massive 68% considering buying an EV in 2022.

Uranium enrichment is a critical step in the production of nuclear power.
US Enrichment Capacity Has Declined Precipitously With large-scale gaseous diffusion technology developed during the Manhattan Project, the US once led the world in uranium enrichment.

As hyperscalers turn to nuclear power for clean reliable energy to support growing demand for AI-related compute, President Trump has signed an Executive Order to quadruple US nuclear capacity by 2050.1 Accounting for up to ~50% of uranium fuel costs, enrichment has become a critical bottleneck.2 Once the sole provider of nuclear enrichment in the West,3 the US now has virtually no commercial enrichment capacity. Europe, Russia, and China now dominate, as shown below. According to our research, a looming demand-supply imbalance highlights the urgent need to invest in domestic enrichment capacity, not only to enable AI but also to bolster energy independence and meet 2050 goals.

What Is Uranium Enrichment?

Uranium enrichment is a critical step in the production of nuclear power. Natural uranium contains ~0.7% of the fissionable isotope U235,5 far less than that needed for reactor fuel. Enrichment increases the U235 concentration, with requirements varying by application, as shown below. Advanced reactors can require U235 levels roughly ~20x higher than that in natural uranium.

Enrichment is measured by Separative Work Units (SWU), the standard metric of capacity.6 Because of the minimal incremental effort required to move from advanced reactor-grade to weapons-grade uranium, as shown below, enrichment facilities are highly sensitive geopolitically and subject to strict oversight under international non-proliferation agreements. From a commercial standpoint, however, while enrichment above 5% requires only modest additional SWU, reaching 20% yields only ~26 kg of product from 1,000 kg of natural uranium feed—underscoring that SWU scales roughly linearly with desired output mass.

Note: This chart assumes a fixed amount of feed (1 tonne) and shows the SWU required to reach different U235 concentrations in the product stream. It does not show the resulting product mass, which decreases sharply as enrichment increases. When adjusted for a fixed quantity of product, the additional SWU required rises roughly linearly with enrichment.

Historically, enrichment relied on energy-intensive gaseous diffusion. Today, gas centrifuges are much more efficient, and laser enrichment—still under development—promises significant improvements, though proliferation concerns could impede its path to commercialization, as shown below.

Note: The separation factor measures how effectively a single enrichment stage increases U235 concentration. Higher-efficiency methods like centrifuge and laser require fewer stages than diffusion, enabling smaller, more concealable facilities that are harder to detect and could be used for covert weapons production.

US Enrichment Capacity Has Declined Precipitously

With large-scale gaseous diffusion technology developed during the Manhattan Project, the US once led the world in uranium enrichment. As the Soviet Union and Europe developed more efficient centrifuge methods, the US launched the Gas Centrifuge Enrichment Plant (GCEP) in the 1970s to remain competitive. Unfortunately, the Three Mile Island crisis destroyed the appetite for nuclear power in the US and then, as global markets moved into oversupply, the US cancelled GCEP in 1985 and began to rely on its aging diffusion plants,8 as shown below.

In the 1990s, the US privatized enrichment under United States Enrichment Corporation (USEC), which relied on outdated diffusion and then pursued AVLIS10—a laser-based enrichment method that encountered debilitating technical hurdles.11 In 1993, a Megatons to Megawatts deal flooded the global market with cheap Russian enriched uranium, further discouraging US investment.12 In 2014, USEC declared bankruptcy, reemerging a few months later as Centrus Energy.13 Without industrial scale diffusion or commercial centrifuge projects, the US now is decades behind Russia, China, Germany, Netherlands, and the UK, as shown below.

Note: China’s industrial-scale centrifuge program was initially reliant on Russian technology but has significantly accelerated domestic capacity over the past few decades.

Now Is The Time To Invest

ARK’s research suggests that, unlike forecasts in the 1980s, SWUs will be in short supply by 2030 thanks to rising demand from new nuclear buildouts, including Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), as shown below.

Note: The forecast above is based on average SWU per MWe per year by reactor type. The upside case assumes all reactors under construction and 50% of planned reactors (with submitted construction permits) will require SWU by 2030. The downside case assumes 50% of both under-construction and planned reactors will require SWU by then.

Forecasts are inherently limited and cannot be relied upon.

Geopolitical risks have catapulted the US into action. Executive Orders are channeling billions of dollars into rebuilding our nuclear fuel ecosystem,15 with companies like Centrus Energy, Global Laser Enrichment, General Matter, and LIS Technologies in line to benefit. That said, commercial-scale deployment will require investment, create significant execution risks, and require policy support to guarantee not only US energy independence but also AI dominance.

Conclusion

Rising energy demand and electrification are stimulating the resurgence of the nuclear industry in the US. Given the shortfall in global enrichment capacity likely by 2030, the US must rebuild domestic capacity to remain competitive. Not only will increased domestic capacity support hyperscalers seeking clean reliable power and enable nuclear and SMR deployment, but it also will restore US leadership in the nuclear fuel cycle. Overcoming development and deployment challenges will require serious coordination between business and government, targeted policy support, and long-term investment. In our view, the US is gearing up for success.",https://assets.arkinvest.com/media-8e522a83-1b23-4d58-a202-792712f8d2d3/af021ac0-858b-4257-87a5-a26ba2020f2b/ARK Invest_090425_Enrichment_Social.png,N,,2025-09-05 14:04:45.332985

Lovins",,,,,https://www.utilitydive.com/news/nuclear-power-smr-ai-amory-lovins/758660/,"An intensive influence campaign seeks to resurrect a “nuclear renaissance” from the industry’s slow-motion collapse documented in the independent annual World Nuclear Industry Status Report.
And nuclear power faces the same fundamental challenges as fossil fuels: uncompetitive costs, runaway competitors, dwindling profits, and uncertain demand.
Nonetheless, nuclear power is being boosted by fierce lobbying and federal policy as essential for new AI data centers vital for prosperity and security.
Claims of soaring AI electricity use are projections, not realities, except in a few “hot spots” like two Virginia counties.
Most proposed AI data centers are speculative and unlikely to get built; many built won’t thrive.","An intensive influence campaign seeks to resurrect a “nuclear renaissance” from the industry’s slow-motion collapse documented in the independent annual World Nuclear Industry Status Report. Claims that past failures won’t recur have convinced many politicians that socializing nuclear investments rejected by private capital markets, weakening or bypassing rigorous safety regulation, suppressing market competition, and commanding military reactor and data-center projects as a national-security imperative will restore nuclear expansion and transform the economy.

This illusion neatly fits the industry’s business-model shift from selling products to harvesting subsidies.

A few awkward facts intrude. Even the most skilled firms and nations keep delivering big reactors with several times the promised cost and construction time. A swarm of startup firms that have never built a reactor are dubiously rebranding their inexperience as a winning advantage. New designs are said to be so safe they don’t need normal precautions (though not safe enough to waive nuclear energy’s unique exemption from accident liability). Political interference in nuclear licensing is eroding public confidence. Proposed smaller reactors cost more per kWh, produce more nuclear waste per kWh, and often need more-concentrated fuel directly usable for nuclear weapons.

And nuclear power faces the same fundamental challenges as fossil fuels: uncompetitive costs, runaway competitors, dwindling profits, and uncertain demand. Few if any vendors have made profits selling reactors — only fueling and fixing them. Nuclear electricity loses in open auctions, so only Congressional bailouts — $27 billion ($15 billion paid out) in 2005, $133 billion in 2021-22, tens of billions more in 2025 — saved most existing U.S. reactors from closure.

Now comes another vision: powering the glorious new world of artificial intelligence. This may be a trillion-dollar bubble, but it’s sellable until market realities intervene. The International Energy Agency expects data centers, mostly non-AI, to cause only a tenth of global electricity demand growth to 2030, doubling their share of usage — to just 3%. So AI won’t eat the grid. But IEA forecasts renewables will power data-center growth 10-20 times over, while Bloomberg NEF predicts over 100. Nuclear lost the race to power the grid, so new reactors have no business case or operational need.

Each year, nuclear adds as much net global capacity as renewables add every two days. Soaring renewables generate three times more global electricity than stagnant nuclear power, whose 9% world and 18% U.S. shares keep shrinking. In 2023-24, China added 197 times more solar and wind than nuclear capacity, at half the cost. In May, China added 93 GW of solar, or 3 GW per day.

Despite having turned nuclear power into a minor distraction, renewables are dismissed as “intermittent.” Again, facts intrude.

Military and industrial installations already prefer 100% renewables for their most critical applications, including Apple’s data centers in four states. Ten kinds of carbon-free resources can balance variable (but highly predictable) renewables, keeping the grid stable. Using a small subset, power systems with modest or no hydropower already sustain such annual renewable fractions of electricity use as Denmark 88+%, South Australia 74% (expecting 100% in two years), and Germany 54%.

And since a nuclear kWh costs several to many times more than a renewable or saved kWh — even more if nuclear load-follows to “complement” rather than curtail renewables — nuclear displaces less fossil fuel per dollar (or year), making climate change worse.

Nonetheless, nuclear power is being boosted by fierce lobbying and federal policy as essential for new AI data centers vital for prosperity and security. This case can’t withstand scrutiny. My essay “Artificial Intelligence Meets Natural Stupidity: Managing the Risks” shows:

Data centers use about 4.5-5% of U.S. and 1.5% of world electricity, and lately caused only about 5% of world electricity demand growth. Of all data-center electricity, about one-fourth in the U.S. or one-ninth globally is for AI, the rest for traditional uses.

Claims of soaring AI electricity use are projections, not realities, except in a few “hot spots” like two Virginia counties. In 2023, AI added roughly 0.04% to world and 0.1% to U.S. electricity use.

Most proposed AI data centers are speculative and unlikely to get built; many built won’t thrive. Major power-supply investments risk getting stranded.

Demand for AI services is enormously uncertain. So is their business case: AI’s proven value in narrowly specialized technical applications looks too small to repay its immense investments. Many general users don’t need or want to pay for AI.

Big Tech firms rarely sign specific nuclear power purchase agreements. Much of the hype is about vague statements of interest in buying electricity timely at an attractive price, or modest, symbolic investments. Big Tech rightly prefers renewables as faster, surer and cheaper.

The efficiency of turning electricity into AI services roughly quadruples each year, so a new data center must roughly quadruple its sales of AI services each year for decades to keep using and paying for the same amount of electricity — a tall order.

This spring, innovators showed how operating AI data centers slightly more flexibly without compromising service can power at least the next decade of U.S. AI growth with no new generators, stranding more electricity and gas investments.

The coal industry’s 1999 campaign to create panic that the Internet would falter without huge power expansions misled investors, worsening a 2000-02 bloodbath when hundreds of new power plants weren’t needed. Today’s trends, pushing an AI case for unsellable and too-late nuclear and gas projects, rhyme with that disaster.

The latest risk to the AI/nuclear case came into focus in Sparks, Nevada, in June, when Redwood Energy (a new activity of dominant battery-recycler Redwood Materials) revealed North America’s largest microgrid.

Read More in Generation

Twenty MW-DC of photovoltaics are laid flat on level ground. Water-recovering Roomba-like crawlers clean them nightly. About 800 battery packs from retired or crashed cars — the world’s largest use of second-life batteries — are wrapped in white plastic and set on cinderblocks, safely separated. They’re good for another few years, then hot-swappable. Novel power electronics and software meld those diverse batteries into 63 MWh of storage with 2-48-hour nominal duration. (Redwood Energy is already engineering similar microgrids an order of magnitude larger, enough to run most existing data centers.)

The resulting 100%-solar microgrid produces 10 MW-AC of ultrareliable 24/7/365 power that runs modular Crusoe data centers onsite, eliminating transmission costs, losses and approvals. This all-solar power is more reliable than grid power, cheaper than the utility’s 8¢/kWh retail price, and all built in four months.

Thus, we needn’t guess or debate whether a particular data center will get built and flourish. Instead, we can commit to build its onsite solar power plant, perhaps by competitive procurement, only when the data center’s 1.5 to 2.5 years of construction is mostly done. Needing no grid connection, the solar microgrid needs few if any approvals — just cheap land. It’s inherently safe, silent, automatic, virtually water- and maintenance-free, based on common commodities, zero-emission, portable and durably profitable.

Can your reactor do that? If not, why build it?",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/IIvuAknn3qXoXCWm0BuZQP6aZjGccX3WsGA-vjmJdIY/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9CZWF2ZXJfVmFsbGV5X051Y2xlYXJfUG93ZXJfUGxhbnRfWXdmVm42Uy5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-09-05 13:05:54.791982

That’s certainly true for the styling, which is nearly copy-paste from the Vision Neue Klasse X of last year.","BMW has waited longer than many major manufacturers to announce a platform designed from the start for electric vehicles. From our first official look at the iX3, the first of the “Neue Klasse” EV family, BMW has used that time wisely. Not only has BMW borrowed the smartest EV tech from its competitors, but it has also added some unique touches of its own.

Though BMW doesn’t like to call it a new platform, that’s essentially what the Neue Klasse is. (Those of you who remember your BMW history will know that this is technically the Neue Neue Klasse.) The iX3 debuts many features that are in fact new to BMW: 800V architecture, a combination of synchronous and asynchronous motors, a new type of dash-mounted display, a new kind of battery cell, and a new type of electrical architecture, plus new software and hardware throughout. While many “all-new” vehicles are only incrementally different from their predecessors, the iX3 represents an unusually large step forward.

That’s certainly true for the styling, which is nearly copy-paste from the Vision Neue Klasse X of last year. In setting the tone for the new EV lineup, the iX3 also launches a fresh design language for BMW. Here’s what design head Adrian van Hooydonk has to say about it: “The design of the Neue Klasse provides a very modern interpretation of what BMW has always stood for. With our new design language, the new BMW iX3 looks future-focused, modern, and timeless—but, above all, more BMW than ever.”

It’s worth noting the low drag coefficient of 0.24, which BMW has accomplished without making the car look like a cough drop on stilts. (Sorry, Mercedes.)

As you’d guess, the iX3 is about the same size as the popular X3. The biggest difference is the electric car’s wheelbase, which is two inches longer than the gas-powered car’s. But it’s the drivetrain that’s interesting.

For context, roughly 75 percent of electric vehicles today use permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs), because they are highly efficient and power-dense. However, says Sajeev Krishnan, who leads a team working on high-voltage electronic product design at the Dana Corporation, “The bang-for-the-buck equation is changing.” Those magnets are made of rare earth minerals, and “global supply chains are always threatening rare earth materials.” Induction motors may sound like a good alternative, because they don’t use rare earth minerals, and are very durable, but they are not as power-dense or as efficient. Though Tesla once relied on them, induction motors are used in only 15 or 20 percent of vehicles today … a number which now includes the iX3.

For the sixth generation of its “eDrive” technology, which debuts in this car, BMW has chosen a strategy that is complex and expensive—building two different types of motors. The iX3 pairs an “extensively upgraded” externally excited synchronous motor (EESM) on the rear axle with a new AC induction motor on the front. EESMs, says Krishnan, are a promising technology: While less durable than brushless DC motors and reliant on expensive components like semiconductors and high-speed rotary connectors, EESMs don’t use rare-earth materials, and they are more responsive at low speeds than induction motors. What does all this mean, practically? Think of the iX3 as a front-biased AWD vehicle that calls upon one or both motors depending on the situation: The EESM delivers continuous highway efficiency and strong torque at low speeds, while the induction motor kicks in when extra traction or performance is needed, and idles magnet-free when cruising.

The addition of the induction motor, together with the improvements to the EESM motor, “reduces energy losses by 40% compared to fifth-generation BMW eDrive technology, weight by 10%, and manufacturing costs by 20%.”

BMW has also borrowed the best ideas of its competitors. The cells within the battery are cylindrical, a type that Tesla has relied upon for years. While they can’t be packed together as tightly as prismatic or pouch-type cells, cylindrical cells don’t swell (due to the buildup of gases) and are easily equipped with devices that disconnect faulty cells. The zonal electric architecture, in which the wiring harness is divided into zones, was made popular by Rivian, whose approach was so successful that it convinced VW to form a joint venture with Rivian to create software and electronics for electric vehicles. The zonal approach reduces weight by eliminating thousands of feet of wiring. Finally, like many other EVs, including many GM and Tesla vehicles, the iX3 is capable of powering devices, homes (if equipped with the proper equipment), or sending power back to the grid.

Like Ford, who recently announced a $5B investment and a Universal EV Platform, BMW seems to have thought long and hard about its new EV platform, and has spent the big bucks to build this platform for the long term, packing in some genuinely interesting and ambitious features. Stay tuned for our first drive, when we get to more fully digest the most important new offering from BMW in years, and try out the automatic lane-change feature, which the driver initiates by glancing at the respective side-view mirror…! (Yes, the car makes sure the lane is clear first.)

The most challenging task of the iX3, however, has been set by its maker. It must not only be a good EV; if it is to live up to the standard of the original Neue Klasse, it must prove itself “a real BMW.”",https://hagerty-media-prod.imgix.net/2025/09/P90615618_highRes-scaled.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&ixlib=php-3.3.0,N,,2025-09-05 12:11:57.766905

“With or without the tax credit, these improvements bring energy savings that lower energy bills,” he said.","The “one big beautiful bill” that President Donald Trump signed into law in July is set to upend many aspects of American life, including climate policy. The law, which Republicans backed en masse, not only derails the nation’s efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it could also strike a blow to consumers’ pocketbooks.

From a climate perspective, the legislation’s most significant rollbacks are aimed at industries such as renewable energy, not individuals. But there will be very real impacts for taxpayers hoping to decarbonize their homes.

The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, provided tax credits for climate-friendly purchases ranging from heat pumps to solar arrays through 2032. That time frame has been cut to as little as a few months.

“This bill is going to take away a lot of assistance from consumers,” said Lowell Ungar, director of federal policy for the nonprofit American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. He noted that two million people used the home improvement tax credit in its first year alone.

The good news is that the law does not affect the billions of dollars that the IRA already sent to state efficiency and electrification rebate programs, and that much of that money will remain available beyond the federal sunsets. But, Ungar added, the tax credits can still save people thousands of dollars before they vanish.

“If consumers are able to make the investment now,” he said, “it will help them out.”

For those looking to act, Grist shares a roundup of when credits will go away.

Buy an EV before October

New electric vehicles that meet federal domestic manufacturing requirements qualify for a tax credit of up to $7,500. While credits on foreign-made EVs aren’t offered directly to consumers, automakers do get them and often pass the savings along through leases. Used EVs under $25,000 that are purchased at a dealer are also eligible for up to a $4,000 credit.

All of this goes away on September 30. There will be no credits after that. Ultimately, this will make new electric vehicles more expensive and put the technology further out of reach for low- to moderate-income Americans.

The income caps on the EV credits still apply, limiting the benefit on new EVs to those households earning less than $300,000 and on used vehicles to those earning less than $150,000. There is an MSRP limit of $80,000 for new cars, too.

Strangely, the tax credit for installing an EV charger (up to $1,000) runs through June of next year.

Make home improvements by the end of the year

The remarkably vast Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit provides up to $2,000 toward qualified heat pumps, water heaters, biomass stoves, or biomass boilers. It offers another $1,200 toward efficiency upgrades such as insulation, doors, windows, and even home energy audits.

These are going away on December 31. All items must be “placed in service” by then to qualify, though a reminder: Tax credits lower your tax liability but don’t come back as rebates. You must have a tax bill to benefit, which may not be the case for certain low-income households.

Pay for solar this year

The most valuable IRA incentive being axed is the Residential Clean Energy Credit. It covers 30 percent of clean energy systems such as solar panels, wind turbines, and geothermal heat pumps, and there is no cap. With the average cost of a solar system in the U.S. just north of $28,000, that means a tax credit would be worth around $8,500. That credit vanishes at the end of this year, though the law refers to the “expenditures” being made by then, so that could mean paying for — but not necessarily installing — a system by then.

Like with other credits, Ungar suggests confirming any changes with a tax professional. He also said that the potential for higher tariffs is another reason to move quickly. But, he said, even after the credits go away, many of these improvements could still make financial sense over the long term.

“With or without the tax credit, these improvements bring energy savings that lower energy bills,” he said. “In some cases, improvements are going to be a no-brainer regardless.”",https://media-cdn.socastsrm.com/uploads/station/2078/fbShare.png?r=75645,N,,2025-09-05 12:07:36.984459

In Pennsylvania, we’re proud of our legacy as a national energy leader.","A growing coalition representing America’s energy and economic leadership is now urging Congress to act swiftly to finally modernize the permitting system and unlock new energy investment.

Upon Congress’s return to Washington, D.C., a diverse group of business and energy organizations sent letters to House and Senate leaders calling for bipartisan permitting reform.

In a letter to Congress signed by the Independent Petroleum Association of America, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, National Association of Manufacturers, Data Center Coalition, American Council on Renewable Energy, National Ocean Industries Association, and more, the business and energy groups wrote:

“The time has come to modernize our nation’s permitting systems so that our communities can build the infrastructure necessary to grow our economy, create good-paying jobs, and meet the challenges of today and tomorrow.”

In a separate letter published in September, the Natural Gas Council highlighted the impact on U.S. energy security:

“Clear, predictable infrastructure permitting processes remain instrumental to achieving our shared economic, security, and climate-related goals… the current processes to site and approve new and expanded infrastructure remain cumbersome, often stalling projects for years with duplicative reviews, unnecessarily burdensome approvals, and unending legal challenges.”

The Natural Gas Council also stressed the need for immediate action to protect consumers:

“These inefficiencies hamper access to domestic natural gas resources, creating reliance on imports, raising energy costs in certain regions, and, in the worst cases, limiting access to energy during periods of extreme weather.”

The vast majority of voters also support faster permitting timelines to speed up energy projects. A recent poll from Cyngal shows that 66 percent of likely voters support modernizing permitting rules, especially when expected increases in electricity demand (and cost) are taken into account.

Why Reform Is Needed Now

America’s ability to build the infrastructure needed for reliable and affordable energy is being slowed by outdated permitting rules. Lengthy reviews and unpredictable approval timelines are preventing critical projects from moving forward.

At the same time, rising electricity demand—driven by everything from manufacturing expansion to new data center construction—is putting additional strain on a grid already facing high costs and looming winter price spikes.

The letters outline these and more reasons why Congress must move quickly:

Keeping Energy Affordable: Electricity prices are already high and are projected to surge this winter. The problem, industry leaders argue, is not utility pricing but infrastructure bottlenecks that delay new transmission and generation projects.

Supporting Economic Growth: Delays in approvals drive up project costs and undermine U.S. competitiveness. Permitting challenges are delaying infrastructure investments that are critical to maintaining America’s energy and economic leadership.

Modernizing the Grid: New technologies such as AI are fueling massive power demand. Without faster approvals, utilities and developers cannot add the generation and transmission capacity needed to keep pace.

Will Permitting Finally Have Its Moment?

Leaders in the House aim to place permitting reform at the center of the congressional agenda this fall.

In July, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise told Politico, “I want to see permitting reform this fall.” Citing bipartisan support for reform, Rep. Scalise said, “let’s give [Democrats] that opportunity to help us get it done.”

One bipartisan bill is already moving ahead. Over the summer, House Natural Resources Chair Bruce Westerman (R-AR) and Rep. Jared Golden (D-ME) introduced the SPEED Act, which aims to streamline reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act. Changes to NEPA could unlock new development in energy, housing, and infrastructure across the country.

Recognizing a need for a balanced approach, Rep. Jared Golden (D-ME) emphasized:

“Being a good steward of our environment doesn’t mean we must tolerate a yearslong permitting process that is onerous, overly complex and ripe for litigation abuse.”

Bipartisan State Leaders Support Reform

While partisan disagreements remain, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and throughout state and federal government are calling for compromise.

Earlier this year at the National Governors Association annual meeting, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum delivered remarks highlighting the importance of an efficient and safe permitting process.

“When we generate energy here, it’s cleaner, safer, smarter than anywhere in the world. When we do that, it’s good for the global environment, it’s good for our economy, and it’s good for our allies. We want to champion innovation over regulation.”

Pennsylvania’s Governor Josh Shapiro (D) echoed these comments, saying:

“We have got to get to market more quickly – particularly when it comes to energy projects. In Pennsylvania, we’re proud of our legacy as a national energy leader. One of the biggest issues that holds us back from doing even more in this space is permitting.”

Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt (R) also joined the call for reform, arguing “it shouldn’t take longer to approve a project than it takes to build it.” The two governors have since announced a new bipartisan working group to explore ways to speed up permitting, including NEPA reform.",https://www.energyindepth.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/eid_favicon_new.png,N,,2025-09-05 12:11:16.321568

Conclusion Clean energy offers a powerful opportunity for declining industrial towns to reimagine their futures.
Call to Action Do you believe clean energy can revive industrial towns, or are other strategies needed to ensure their survival?","Across the United States, many industrial towns face the same challenge: factories have closed, jobs have disappeared, and once-thriving communities are struggling to survive. As traditional industries fade, the question arises—can clean energy offer these towns a path forward? By leveraging renewable energy projects and clean-tech investments, declining industrial towns may have an opportunity to reinvent themselves, creating new jobs and revitalizing local economies.

The Decline of Industrial Economies

For decades, manufacturing hubs drove economic growth in small and mid-sized towns. Steel mills, textile factories, and automotive plants provided stable employment and supported local businesses. However, globalization, automation, and outsourcing shifted these industries overseas or eliminated many of the jobs altogether.

The result has been shrinking tax bases, rising unemployment, and populations moving away in search of opportunities. Communities that were once the economic backbone of America are now grappling with the question of survival.

How Clean Energy Can Revitalize Local Economies

1. Job Creation in Renewable Energy

Clean energy industries such as wind, solar, and battery storage offer significant potential for job growth. Building and maintaining renewable energy infrastructure requires skilled labor, including technicians, engineers, and construction workers. Unlike some declining industries, clean energy jobs cannot easily be outsourced, giving local communities a more secure economic future.

2. Attracting Investment and Innovation

Clean energy projects often attract state and federal funding, as well as private investment. This influx of capital can spark further innovation and development, encouraging new businesses to open and existing ones to expand. For industrial towns with underused land or empty factories, renewable energy projects can provide a fresh purpose and attract outside partners.

3. Supporting Local Businesses

When renewable projects come to town, local businesses benefit. Hotels, restaurants, and service providers often see increased demand from workers involved in clean energy construction and maintenance. Over time, the growth of clean energy companies can anchor a new local economy, creating long-term stability.

Examples of Towns Turning to Clean Energy

1. Buffalo, New York Once a thriving industrial city, Buffalo has invested in solar energy manufacturing through projects like the Tesla Gigafactory. Though challenges remain, the clean energy sector has brought hundreds of jobs and renewed attention to the region’s industrial potential.

2. Eastern Kentucky Coal-dependent communities in Eastern Kentucky are experimenting with solar energy projects on former mine lands. These projects not only create jobs but also provide a way to reuse land that would otherwise remain abandoned, giving new life to struggling rural areas.

3. Colorado’s Transition Towns Colorado has been investing heavily in wind energy, with former fossil fuel-dependent regions beginning to see opportunities for workforce retraining. Clean energy projects are helping shift the economic base while keeping workers employed in industries related to power generation.

Challenges of Relying on Clean Energy Alone

While clean energy presents significant opportunities, it is not a cure-all. Some towns face hurdles in retraining workers, securing enough investment, or ensuring that wages in renewable industries match those lost from manufacturing. Additionally, transitioning economies require strong leadership and planning to avoid leaving workers behind.

Another challenge lies in infrastructure. Communities must upgrade power grids, transportation systems, and broadband access to fully take advantage of clean energy investments. Without this groundwork, renewable projects may struggle to deliver long-term economic transformation.

The Role of Policy and Community Leadership

For clean energy to truly save declining industrial towns, policies at the federal, state, and local levels are essential. Incentives, tax breaks, and funding for workforce retraining can make or break a community’s ability to transition.

Equally important is community leadership. Local leaders who can align residents, businesses, and government agencies around a shared vision are crucial for success. By ensuring that clean energy benefits are distributed equitably, communities can avoid the pitfalls of past industrial shifts that left workers behind.

Conclusion

Clean energy offers a powerful opportunity for declining industrial towns to reimagine their futures. By creating jobs, attracting investment, and revitalizing local economies, renewable energy can serve as a foundation for long-term growth. Yet, success depends on more than just technology—it requires leadership, planning, and policies that prioritize both economic and community well-being.

At the same time, ongoing legislation changes and uncertainty ahead of the upcoming mayoral election scheduled for November coupled with average daily rate (ADR) rising 41% YOY for the last quarter, are also impacting the decline in corporate demand for New York.

With enquiries for New York City down by nearly a third – 29% – for the first half of 2025 compared to the same period last year, it has been replaced by Dubai in the top five cities for corporate demand according to the latest SilverDoor booking data:

Corporate demand and mobility are growing from the advancing technology sector which is continuing to increase its footprint across the West Coast and towards the southern states.

The advance of AI and machine learning investment is spearheading the combined 44% growth in demand YOY for this quarter across Seattle and California’s Silicon Valley.

Likewise further south, Houston in particular continues to offer comparatively lower operating costs, more favourable tax rates and a significantly lower ADR compared to New York such that as corporates continue to diversify operations beyond core cities, bookings for the popular Texas city are up 58% YOY this quarter.

The ever-advancing growth in AI investment is also having a ripple effect across the Pacific into the APAC region. Whilst Singapore demand remains high, it is starting to soften, with a 10% decline in demand YOY and ADR also following suit with a similar 13.5% decline YOY for the last quarter.

Growth in AI demand globally has meant growth in demand for semiconductor manufacturing particularly in Taiwan. Likewise tech sector and cloud service growth is impacting demand in Tokyo – both destinations are reporting triple figure growth of 600% and 154% increase in bookings respectively for this quarter YOY.

Across EMEA it is the renewable energy sector that has delivered significant growth in destinations to more coastal locations. Investment in solar power and offshore wind farms, particularly in Spain, has resulted in a marked shift in corporate demand as bookings for a number of destinations including Bilbao, Valencia and Zaragoza are all on the rise. Bilbao bookings have increased by 50% in the last quarter compared to the same period in 2024, Zaragoza bookings are up five-fold, and the number of room nights booked in Valencia in the last quarter is up 380% YOY.

An increase of bookings by 65% YOY for the last quarter has seen Dubai claim a place in the top five with growth in demand for the region primarily coming from not only an increase in extended stays but also an increase in relocation assignees from the financial, law and pharmaceutical sectors, all of which are increasing investment across Dubai and the Middle East.

Commenting on the report, Martin Klima, SilverDoor chief customer officer, said, “These latest demand trends reflect a continuing wider shift in both corporate travel and operating policies. As businesses continue to balance their own growth plans against wider geopolitical and economic landscapes, diversifying operations and locations can be one way to achieve just that. Growth in regions beyond the more traditionally popular hubs like New York City towards cities in western and southern US states, and likewise the significant APAC demand growth in Taiwan, indicate where corporates are committing to investing their funds and placing their people.”

He added: “As AI, technology, and renewable energy investment continues, it will be interesting to watch how the diversification trend evolves in the coming months and the impact it will have on demand across both the serviced apartment and wider accommodation sector both, from a short-term and longer-term perspective. Growth in serviced apartment usage also comes with a shift in how corporate travellers are choosing their accommodation. Guests are increasingly keen to return to a particular apartment or operator if and when budgets and policy allow, particularly for longer stays where assignees have come to know and trust a specific operator. Pointing to more brands now having a strong presence in different markets and delivering consistent levels of service and quality throughout their portfolio, this brings with it the potential for increased loyalty across the sector.”",https://www.c-mw.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/lala-miklos-qxstzQ__HMk-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 12:09:59.075184

The iX3, a sport utility vehicle BMW debuted in Munich on Friday, comes with slick software, ultra-fast charging and a refreshed design. It kicks off the Neue Klasse, a line of EVs the manufacturer spent well over €10 billion ($11.7 billion) on to dethrone Tesla Inc. and BYD Co.

“This is the best overall product in the industry,” BMW Chief Executive Officer Oliver Zipse said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. It’s “a global product with benchmark features.”

The SUV, which starts at €68,900 in Germany, is a key test for BMW at a time of upheaval in the industry. US President Donald Trump’s tariffs are adding costs and forcing companies to adapt their supply chains, while China’s fast-moving manufacturers are pushing into a stagnant European auto market, challenging BMW, Volkswagen AG and Stellantis NV on their home turf.

The iX3 will manage as much as 805 kilometers (500 miles) of range under Europe’s test procedure, and its charging system can add 372 kilometers after just 10 minutes of plugging in. Tesla’s longest-range Model Y can drive as far as 622 kilometers on a full battery.

BMW is under pressure to lower the iX3’s sticker for the version that will go on sale next year in China, where a brutal EV price war is denting automaker profits.

BMW and Mini’s combined sales in China slumped 15% during the first half of the year as BYD, Xiaomi Corp. and Xpeng Inc. dominate the world’s biggest EV market with desirable features at affordable prices. The Neue Klasse is meant to change that, and BMW is cooperating with Chinese partners - including with DeepSeek, Huawei and Alibaba - to tailor its cars to local tastes.

“We are and will be competitive also in China,” Zipse said, adding that the iX3 to be sold in the country will be “more Chinese than ever.”

The SUV is just the start, with an electric sedan coming out next year. BMW showed off a camouflaged version in Munich on Friday. The manufacturer will update the majority of its portfolio with Neue Klasse technology within two years after investing more than €10 billion in new software, batteries and factories, Zipse said.

Prime Minister Mark Carney’s government will make the announcement Friday as one of a series of measures to help companies in the industries most affected by US President Donald Trump’s trade war, according to people familiar with the matter, speaking on condition they not be identified.

Carney’s predecessor, Justin Trudeau, had passed rules that required automakers to ensure that at least 20% of sales were zero-emission vehicles by the model year 2026. But the government won’t implement that target now: instead, it will launch a review of the so-called “electric vehicle availability standard” to make sure it doesn’t create burdens on automakers, the people said.

It’s another illustration of how Carney, who took over in March, is unwinding some policies of the Trudeau era, partly because of the pressures of the trade war. The prime minister has withdrawn many retaliatory tariffs on US products, scrapped a carbon tax on consumers’ use of fossil fuels and ditched a new tax on digital services after Trump complained about it.

The auto industry has been lobbying for months to change the EV mandate, arguing that the targets were unrealistic and would add costs and put jobs at risk.

In June, about 8% of new vehicles sold in Canada were zero-emission. The percentage has declined this year because the federal government cut off a consumer incentive that had offered as much as C$5,000 ($3,622) to buyers of clean-energy vehicles, saying the program had run out of money.

The Trudeau electric vehicle standard raised the bar over time so that by 2035, all new cars and light trucks sold in Canada would have to be emissions-free.

“These targets were made up by the government, not based on any sound assessment of real market dynamics,” Brian Kingston, chief executive officer of the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers’ Association, said in an interview in August. The CVMA represents General Motors Co., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler parent Stellantis NV, all of which have manufacturing operations in the province of Ontario.

Under the electric vehicle mandate, manufacturers that failed to meet the sales targets would likely have been forced to restrict sales of internal combustion engine vehicles or buy credits from companies like Tesla Inc., Kingston said.

Automakers around the world are facing higher costs from US tariffs, and EV manufacturers are also facing pressures from US moves to gut fuel-efficiency rules and remove consumer tax credits for buying EVs.

The Canadian industry is highly integrated with the American auto sector: The country exports most of its vehicle production to the US, and imports more American cars and trucks than anywhere else. For that reason, automotive regulations in Canada have long tended to be similar to those in the US.

But the industry is now under threat from the Trump administration’s tariffs on foreign-made vehicles. GM and Stellantis have both curtailed production and reduced shifts at assembly plants in the province of Ontario since the trade war began.

When Trump imposed those tariffs in April, Canada retaliated by putting its own levies on US-made vehicles - essentially matching the White House move.

But Carney’s government also gave automakers a way to apply for tariff relief, as long as they keep their production and investment in Canada.

Hundreds of business people, policy analysts, and conservative advocates filled a downtown Cleveland conference hall last week for the National Conservative Energy Summit. One major theme: the need for both the federal and local governments to remove increasingly high hurdles to building renewable energy.

“Conservatives can and should lead on energy,” said John Szoka, CEO of the Conservative Energy Network, in his opening remarks.

The group, which cohosted the program with the Ohio Conservative Energy Forum, has a mission ​“to champion secure, reliable, affordable, clean American energy.” Its goal of achieving American energy independence includes support for a range of technologies, including solar, wind, battery storage, hydrogen, biomass, and small modular nuclear reactors.

The Trump administration has taken a more single-minded approach to energy.

Since January, it has promoted more fossil-fuel use and stalled the retirement of aging power plants. At the same time, it has rescinded grants and loans for clean energy projects; eliminated tax credits for wind, solar, EVs, and home-energy upgrades; and even halted construction on some offshore wind projects.

“While it’s easy to view this as a roadblock, … it’s a signal that we have more work to do,” Szoka said. He encouraged attendees to use what they learned during the conference in their grassroots efforts to build support for clean energy, especially when faced with extremism and misinformation. ​“If we don’t explain what’s going on clearly, we risk losing the argument before it even starts.”

As President Donald Trump attacks clean energy at the federal level, some states like Colorado and Maine are pushing to speed up deployment. But in general, state and local laws that restrict renewable energy development are gaining steam nationwide. A June report by the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University notes 16 states with laws limiting solar or wind, with over 450 counties and municipalities across more than 40 states imposing other restrictions.

Speaking at the conference, Jenifer French, chair of Ohio’s Power Siting Board and its Public Utilities Commission, noted that approximately 30 counties in the state ban solar or wind energy in all or parts of their territories, an authority granted to them by a 2021 law known as Senate Bill 52. The board or its staff have also determined solar and wind projects are not in the public interest in several cases where bans didn’t apply but where local governments unanimously opposed the proposals.

Asked for her advice to developers, French said, ​“I just think communicating with the local officials around the project is so helpful, and being part of that community and earning their trust is very effective.”

Companies often hear such suggestions, but ​“frankly, I think that’s used as a cop-out sometimes,” said Drew Christensen, senior director of public engagement at utility-scale developer Apex Clean Energy, during a later panel about how policies shape companies’ decisions.

No matter how many community meetings are held, some people will still fight projects, putting pressure on local officials who may not have expertise in energy issues, he noted.

The deference to local governments creates a slippery slope, said Amanda Stallings, senior policy manager for clean-energy developer Geronimo Power, who also spoke on the panel. In her view, the states that pile on restrictive policies will not only see less investment from solar and wind developers, but will also discourage other industries from moving in.

Constraints on renewables also tread on landowners’ property rights, Stallings said, pointing out that in some cases a local government tells farmers not to use their land for solar but would have no problem with a housing development.

“What country do we live in when our government tells us what we can and can’t do?” Stallings said. The point resonated with various attendees from state chapters of the Land and Liberty Coalition, who made comments during networking breaks that property owners should be free to make their own economic decisions about their land.

Meanwhile, ​“this idea of behind-the-scenes picking winners and losers, that’s what’s going to create a reliability problem,” Stallings said. That risk is already visible: Late last month, the grid operator ISO New England warned of potential reliability issues from delaying Revolution Wind, a nearly finished offshore project that the Trump administration has halted for now.

This past spring, Ohio managed to pass bipartisan legislation that is expected to help the state build more energy — both renewable and fossil-fueled — in large part because the law doesn’t pick winners, according to state Rep. Tristan Rader, D-Lakewood. House Bill 15 passed with unanimous support in the Ohio Senate and just two dissenting Republican votes in the House.

Speaking on a panel about the new law, Rader called it a big step but emphasized that the state still has barriers to getting additional renewable energy on the grid.

“We don’t need to incentivize it. In Ohio, we just need a level playing field,” he said.

For one thing, the Ohio Senate removed provisions from HB 15 that would have created a community solar pilot program. Two Republicans in the House have introduced a separate bill to revive a version of that measure.

Beyond that, the law left SB 52’s extra hurdles for solar and wind in place, along with property line setbacks for wind that were tripled by a last-minute addition to a 2014 budget law.

“We have put up a lot of barriers to different forms of power over the years,” said state Rep. Tex Fischer, R-Boardman, who noted that added levels of government review compound uncertainty for developers. ​“I think the solution is removing those barriers.”

The Spring Hill Assembly plant in Tennessee, which builds the Cadillac Lyriq and the upcoming Vistiq SUV, will undergo multiple weeks of downtime in the months ahead. According to internal notices seen by the Detroit Free Press, production will be halted during the week of October 6, again at Thanksgiving, and for the entire month of December.

These adjustments will impact both vehicle assembly and battery pack operations on site, though Ultium Cells employees will remain unaffected.

Starting in January 2026, the plant is expected to operate with only one shift through May, resulting in approximately 700 layoffs. Affected employees will be placed on temporary layoff status with eligibility for benefits under the UAW-GM contract.

Strategic Considerations for Investors For investors, the key lies in balancing Canada’s policy-driven innovation with the U.S.’s market scale.
While Canada’s EV manufacturing sector faces headwinds, its critical minerals and government incentives make it a vital node in North America’s electrification supply chain.","The North American auto market in 2025 is defined by stark contrasts: while the United States demonstrates resilience in electric vehicle (EV) adoption and manufacturing, Canada grapples with a sharp decline in zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) sales and stalled electrification projects. These divergent trajectories present both risks and opportunities for cross-border investors, particularly in electrification infrastructure, supply chain resilience, and policy-driven innovation.

Canada’s ZEV Slump: Policy Shifts and Trade Tensions

Canada’s ZEV market share plummeted to 8.7% in Q1 2025, a 50% drop from its 2024 peak of 18.9% [3]. This decline is attributed to the phase-out of federal subsidies and a lingering trade war with the U.S., which imposed 25% tariffs on Canadian vehicles under Trump-era policies [5]. These tariffs, though not applied to auto parts, have incentivized automakers to shift production south, exacerbating Canada’s manufacturing challenges. For instance, Honda delayed its $15 billion EV supply chain investment in Ontario by two years, while Northvolt’s $7 billion battery plant near Montreal faces uncertainty after the company’s bankruptcy in Sweden [1].

Despite these setbacks, Canada’s EV adoption rate (1.2% of all vehicles) remains slightly higher than the U.S.’s 0.9% [2]. Provinces like Quebec, with a 25% ZEV market share in 2024, demonstrate localized success, but national sales in Quebec fell 50% in Q1 2025, underscoring the fragility of Canada’s EV ecosystem [3].

U.S. EV Resilience: Tax Credits and Market Competition

The U.S. market, by contrast, has shown greater resilience. In 2024, EV sales reached 1.6 million units, driven by the Clean Vehicle Tax Credit, which offered buyers discounts of up to $7,500 [2]. While growth slowed to 10% in 2024 (down from 40% in 2023), the U.S. maintained a 9.6% EV market share in Q1 2025 [1]. Tesla, despite losing ground to new entrants like Rivian and Hyundai, retained 46% of U.S. EV sales in Q2 2025 [2].

However, the U.S. faces its own challenges. The Inflation Reduction Act’s stringent battery sourcing rules and proposed ELITE Vehicles Act threaten to disrupt supply chains, forcing automakers to reshore production. General Motors, for example, invested $4 billion to bring battery cell production back to the U.S. [4]. Meanwhile, the lack of affordable EV models and sparse charging infrastructure (only one public charger per 42 new EVs in Q1 2025) remain barriers [1].

Cross-Border Investment Opportunities

The divergence between Canada and the U.S. creates unique investment opportunities in three areas:

Supply Chain Resilience and Critical Minerals

Canada’s abundant critical minerals (lithium, nickel, cobalt) position it as a strategic partner for U.S. automakers seeking to localize supply chains. The Canadian government’s $169.4 million investment in Linamar Corporation’s EV battery semiconductor project highlights this potential, aiming to create 2,000 jobs and bolster domestic battery production [2]. Investors could target Canadian mining and processing firms, such as Lithium Americas or Neo Lithium, which are expanding capacity to meet U.S. demand.

Cross-Border Electricity Trade and Grid Infrastructure

Droughts in western Canada reduced hydropower exports to the U.S. in 2025, reversing a decades-old trend and increasing U.S. electricity exports to Canada by 70% [4]. This shift underscores the importance of grid infrastructure investments, particularly in Ontario and Quebec, where transmission lines could facilitate bidirectional energy flows. For example, Ontario exported 12 terawatt-hours (TWh) to the U.S. in 2023 but saw its leverage decline amid drought-driven production cuts [2]. Cross-border projects like the proposed Atlantic Wind Connection could stabilize energy trade and support EV charging networks.

Policy-Driven Innovation in Battery Technology

Both countries are pivoting toward lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) batteries, which rely less on restricted minerals like cobalt. U.S. firms like Tesla and Canadian startups such as Echelon Innovation are leading this shift. Investors could also capitalize on U.S. tax credits for recycling facilities, which are critical to reducing reliance on foreign materials.

Strategic Considerations for Investors

For investors, the key lies in balancing Canada’s policy-driven innovation with the U.S.’s market scale. While Canada’s EV manufacturing sector faces headwinds, its critical minerals and government incentives make it a vital node in North America’s electrification supply chain. Conversely, the U.S. offers robust demand and tax incentives but requires navigating regulatory volatility.

A diversified approach—investing in Canadian battery material suppliers while targeting U.S. automakers adapting to Inflation Reduction Act requirements—could mitigate risks. Additionally, infrastructure projects that enhance cross-border electricity trade, such as smart grid technologies, present long-term value as both nations strive for energy security.

Conclusion

The divergent paths of Canada and the U.S. in the EV transition highlight the complexity of North America’s auto market. While Canada’s challenges are significant, its strategic assets in minerals and policy support offer a foundation for recovery. Meanwhile, the U.S. must address infrastructure gaps and regulatory uncertainty to sustain its EV momentum. For investors, the opportunity lies in bridging these gaps through cross-border collaboration, positioning themselves at the intersection of innovation and resilience.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-05 12:10:43.670381
,Texas Environment,2025-09-05 14:52:02+00:00,Newsweek,The Conservative Case for Climate Resilience | Opinion - Newsweek,"Daniel Lehewych, Josh Hammer, Kristina Foltz, Tom Rogers",,,,,https://www.newsweek.com/conservative-case-climate-resilience-opinion-2124171,"Yet across Republican-led states, a different story unfolds—one that suggests climate resilience isn't about accepting liberal environmental ideology, but about protecting what conservatives value most: property, prosperity, and people.
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who famously scrubbed ""climate change"" from state law, has quietly built one of the nation's most ambitious resilience programs.
Florida's $1.8 billion Resilient Florida initiative represents one of the largest state-level climate adaptation investments in American history.
Alabama Governor Kay Ivey, the self-proclaimed ""infrastructure governor,"" established an Energy Infrastructure Bank for grid reliability.
The conservative case for climate resilience isn't about accepting blame or abandoning principles.","On July 4, 2025, 8-year-olds Eloise Peck and Linnie McCown and 9-year-old Lila Bonner went to sleep in the Bubble Inn cabin at Camp Mystic, a 99-year-old Christian summer camp in Texas Hill Country. They never woke up. The Guadalupe River rose 26 feet in 45 minutes, transforming their cabin—which FEMA had removed from flood maps after camp appeals—into a death trap. Twenty-seven people died that night, part of 135 killed statewide. Days later, when asked if investigations would assign blame for the deaths, Texas Governor Greg Abbott bristled at the question itself, declaring that ""who's to blame"" was ""the word choice of losers"" before pivoting to a football analogy about winners focusing on solutions.

Yet across Republican-led states, a different story unfolds—one that suggests climate resilience isn't about accepting liberal environmental ideology, but about protecting what conservatives value most: property, prosperity, and people.

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who famously scrubbed ""climate change"" from state law, has quietly built one of the nation's most ambitious resilience programs. Florida's $1.8 billion Resilient Florida initiative represents one of the largest state-level climate adaptation investments in American history. DeSantis doesn't call it climate action; he has explicitly linked his storm preparedness efforts to property. For instance, he launched the My Safe Florida Home program to help citizens with ""strengthening homes against storms with impact-resistant doors and windows, aiming to reduce insurance costs through mandatory mitigation discounts.""

The reframing works. While Washington debates carbon credits, Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt signed legislation allocating $45 million for a revolving disaster fund to address emergency and rebuilding needs. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that $11 billion in federal infrastructure funding would be directed toward upgrading the state's transportation system and improving water infrastructure.

Georgia Governor Brian Kemp announced $3.3 billion in infrastructure investments emphasizing ""job creation"" and ""incredible growth."" Alabama Governor Kay Ivey, the self-proclaimed ""infrastructure governor,"" established an Energy Infrastructure Bank for grid reliability.

These aren't environmental crusaders. They're pragmatists responding to an insurance crisis that threatens the foundation of conservative economics: property ownership. Florida has lost more than 30 home insurance companies in recent years, with major carriers like Farmers and AAA pulling back coverage. Louisiana homeowners pay roughly three times the national average for insurance premiums.

When insurers flee, property values face downward pressure as banks won't issue mortgages without insurance coverage—threatening to trigger a systemic economic shock similar to 2008. The World Resources Institute found that $1 invested in resilience returns $10.50 over 10 years. Meanwhile, climate disasters now average $140 billion annually, with 2024's Hurricane Helene alone causing $78.7 billion in damages.

Trump's former Defense Secretary James Mattis said, ""Climate change is impacting stability in areas of the world where our troops are operating today."" After rebuilding Tyndall Air Force Base for $4.9 billion post-hurricane, the military now builds to withstand Category 5 storms as standard practice.

Even conservative think tanks are shifting. The Heritage Foundation advocates ""adaptation to extreme weather"" through ""affordable, reliable energy."" The American Enterprise Institute argues to ""shift the majority of our policymaking attention to an agenda of resilience building"" through market mechanisms. R Street Institute notes adaptation appeals to conservatives because it ""use[s] existing wealth to adapt to changing conditions.""

The business community gets it, too. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, no friend to environmental regulation, now argues that every $1 invested in resilience saves $13 in economic impact. Major corporations from Walmart to ExxonMobil are hardening infrastructure not from environmental conviction but from fiduciary duty.

Research shows conservatives strongly prefer adaptation (flood defenses, drought-resistant crops) over mitigation (carbon taxes, renewable mandates). Adaptation doesn't assign blame; it simply prepares for reality. Young Republicans are especially receptive—82 percent of Americans under the age of 35 believe climate change poses a serious problem for future generations.

I'm not a conservative, but I recognize wisdom in this approach. While we need emission reductions, waiting for global consensus while communities flood is its own form of denial. Conservative leaders are already investing billions in resilience. They're just allergic to the vocabulary.

The tragedy is this pragmatism remains disconnected from broader Republican climate policy. While DeSantis invests hundreds of millions in resilience, he removes climate language from state law. Texas spends billions on flood infrastructure while its Republican Party, according to MIT Climate Portal, maintains an official stance opposing ""climate change initiatives"" and emission standards—despite scientific consensus that fossil fuel combustion drives warming that intensifies the state's weather disasters and drought conditions.

Camp Mystic's owner, Dick Eastland, warned about flood dangers for decades. After a 1987 flood killed 10 children, he championed a computerized warning system—shut down in 1999 over maintenance issues. He died trying to save others.

The lesson isn't that conservatives should embrace the Green New Deal. It's that principled conservatives should embrace what they're already doing: protecting property values, ensuring business continuity, avoiding disaster costs, and saving lives. Call it resilience, call it infrastructure, call it economic development—just build it before the next 8-year-old goes to sleep in a floodway.

Conservative communities need more than reactive disaster spending. They need proactive adaptation planning, early warning systems, and honest acknowledgment of increasing risks. Some Republican leaders understand this. More should follow their lead, not because Al Gore tells them to, but because their constituents' lives and livelihoods depend on it.

The conservative case for climate resilience isn't about accepting blame or abandoning principles. It's about recognizing that adaptive pragmatism beats ideological purity when the waters rise. Just ask any parent in Hunt, Texas.

Commenting in a release was Chris Wright, US energy secretary: “If we are going to win the AI race, reindustrialise, and keep the lights on, America is going to need a lot more reliable energy.”

Central to the investment plan is the establishment of the facility in Virginia, which Hitachi Energy says will be a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility, used to produce large power transformers that will support applications like high-voltage transmission, power generation, AI data centres, and large-scale industrial applications.

This facility will be built alongside Hitachi Energy’s existing campus and will be the largest manufacturing site for large power transformers in the US.

AI demand and transformer shortages

Switzerland-based Hitachi Energy, in a release, says the investments will help meet skyrocketing energy demand driven by AI data centres, a key strategy for Trump’s White House, whose Action Plan looks to bring data centres online in droves while optimising the grid for their energy consumption.

To do so, the US is looking to promote domestic access to critical grid technologies, such as transformers, of which the US has been experiencing a severe shortage.

According to an August report from Wood Mackenzie, US supply shortages for power and distribution transformer is expected to hit 30% and 10%, respectively, in 2025. Since 2019, Wood Mackenzie estimates that US power and distribution transformers have seen demand surge by 116% and 41%, respectively.

This has been due to a confluence of new demand drivers, including a rise in electricity consumption, which has increased 7% since 2020, reversing a 1% decline from 2010 to 2020, the growing pipeline for clean energy projects, and ageing infrastructure, Wood Mackenzie notes.

Said Toshiaki Tokunaga, president & CEO of Hitachi: “The United States is a key market for Hitachi, and this investment reflects our commitment to powering America’s energy future to meet the accelerating demands for reliable and sustainable solutions to benefit the nation.

“Leveraging our expertise in IT, operational technology, and advanced products, we are supporting American manufacturing, the development of critical infrastructure, and the rapid expansion of data centres driven by AI adoption.”

Added Andreas Schierenbeck, CEO of Hitachi Energy: “Power transformers are a linchpin technology for a robust and reliable electric grid and winning the AI race.

“Bringing production of large power transformers to the US is critical to building a strong domestic supply chain for the US economy and reducing production bottlenecks, which is essential as demand for these transformers across the economy is surging.”

A sunken compartment inside the BMW iX3 holds the car’s charger.BMW Remarkably, BMW says that 50 percent of the batteries’ lithium, cobalt, and nickel will come from recycled materials.","Since creating its first innovative motorcycle in 1923, and a sporty small car in 1928, BMW built its “Ultimate Driving Machine“ reputation from literal nuts and bolts: Hardware, with thousands of parts engineered, tested, and tuned in the service of cars and motorcycles that would delight owners and guarantee fun.

The automaker’s Neue Klasse (or “New Class”) EVs—led by the production 2026 iX3 SUV that will debut on 8 September at the IAA Mobility show in Munich—show how the industry is being revolutionized. Software is the new king, the element that increasingly differentiates cars and gives automakers their competitive edge. IEEE Spectrum was invited to Munich in July, where BMW executives and engineers showed the iX3 prior to its public reveal, and offered a deep dive into its Neue Klasse tech.

BMW iX3’s Advanced Digital System

Beneath the iX3’s strikingly modern exterior lies a new digital nervous system that will underpin up to 40 new BMW models between now and 2027, including EVs, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, and cars with internal combustion engines. For these software-defined vehicles, four so-called “Superbrains” will sense their surroundings, monitor drivers, and respond to their commands. These four big brains amass 20 times as much computing power as BMW’s current-generation EVs.

As the single largest vehicle investment in BMW history, Neue Klasse includes the “Heart of Joy” controller that engineers see as their secret weapon to make EVs that are safer than ever, yet truly fun to drive—not just in the straight-line speed that has become the norm for Teslas and other models.

Christian Thalmeier, a manager of driving dynamics development at BMW, says weighty EV batteries and electric motors bring new challenges in keeping BMWs feeling agile, stable, and light-footed. The previous 10-millisecond latency of BMW’s more balkanized system controllers was fine for the lumbering responses of internal combustion engines. But they’re no match for the near-instant reactions of electric motors. The Heart of Joy combines all powertrain, chassis, and braking functions into a single unit. Predictive algorithms operate on a high-speed bus at 1,000 “beats” per second, 10 times as fast as before.

“This heart beats very fast, so it makes the car feel alive and agile,” Thalmeier says. “It makes a fairly heavy car handle lightly, something you’ll feel not only under high g-forces, but in normal driving.”

These new EVs use electric motors themselves to influence the car’s handling, stability, and braking behavior. The iX3 not only regenerates 40 percent more electricity than before; BMW estimates that 98 percent of all stops in real-world driving can be handled by the electric motors, with no need for drivers to squeeze the brake pedal. The automaker says iX3 test passengers, after closing their eyes, often can’t tell that the BMW has come to a full stop, with the system delivering precision and smoothness that human drivers can’t match. Brake wear is reduced as well.

Thalmeier offered the example of a driver making a high-speed emergency lane change, followed by a sharp return to the original lane to avoid a collision. It’s a notorious tricky move that, even for relatively skilled drivers, could result in a treacherous loss of control. Between the combined speed of electric motors and computing, the iX3 can divert torque to the rear axle while the driver has barely begun to crank the wheel to avoid a car or obstacle ahead, setting up what’s to come. The car then automatically performs brake interventions at individual wheels and shifts torque to front wheels to maintain control as the car snaps back into its lane. The result is a pro-level maneuver that could avoid a serious collision between two or more cars—and something that would be impossible in any fossil-fueled car.

Semi-Autonomous Driving Innovations

The iX3’s second Superbrain combines the latest generation of semi-automonous driving systems in a single unit (versus four previously). That helps systems operate as a silent companion to boost safety. Semi-autonomous functions are designed to keep the human driver engaged and in the loop, rather than zoning out. Here, a driver can still steer the iX3, apply brakes or even drive intentionally over a lane marker—such as to steer around a bicyclist or romp through high-speed corners — without the driver-assistance system intervening, shutting down or having to be annoyingly restarted. The BMW’s driver-monitoring camera and algorithms will recognize the difference between, say, a courteous or Type-A driver and one who is distracted, and react accordingly.

A third controller manages the infotainment operating system, including AI-supported cloud-based functions, a 3D heads-up display, and a world-first system called Panoramic iDrive, in which driving information is projected onto a black nano-coated surface that stripes the entire lower windshield. Owners can configure six separate slots for the panoramic display, such as navigation maps and performance readouts. The 1.1-meter-long backlit matrix display is designed to be viewable in bright sunlight, or for drivers wearing polarized sunglasses.

Finally, a fourth controller manages basic onboard operations such as vehicle access and security and remote-software upgrades.

Like other legacy automakers, BMW is taking new cues from vertically integrated Chinese powerhouses such as BYD, which sources and develops raw materials, software, batteries and other tech in-house. BMW executives said today’s key is to separate vehicle and software development to future-proof cars, including via over-the-air updates.

“This means we continuously develop software rather than starting from scratch” with each new model, says Christoph Grote, senior vice-president of BMW Group electronics and software.

The iX3 will include the ability to set up a panoramic display on the lower portion of the windshield.BMW

BMW’s global teams are generating 130 times as much software as a decade ago. Roughly 10,000 developers are tasked with more than 1,000 software modules, 20 gigabits of software and 500 million lines of code that will be integrated into the Superbrains and overall architecture. Stable software platforms run on the Superbrains, with a “Shared Service Layer” acting as a connecting “middleware” element whose functions include cybersecurity and flexible over-the-air updates.

The digital nervous system allows a radically simplified wiring harness, eliminating 600 meters of wiring for a 30-percent weight savings. The brains and their high-speed data connections link with smaller “zonal controllers” that manage data flows exclusively in their zones.

BMW iX3’s Powerful Electric Motors

As for the actual nuts and bolts of the iX3, they’re impressive in their own right. An initial iX3 M50 xDrive model churns up 345 kilowatts of power (463 horsepower) and 645 Newton-meters of torque from its electric motors. BMW’s redesigned dual electric motors, with an asynchronous front motor and a synchronous unit at the rear, integrate silicon-carbide inverters, and reduce friction losses by 40 percent. The automaker estimates the all-wheel-drive iX3 will scoot from 0 to 100 kilometers per hour in 4.9 seconds, and reach a top speed of 210 kph.

These models adopt a leading-edge 800-volt platform, double that of Tesla’s, and on par with leading models from Chinese makers, Hyundai/Kia, Porsche, Vivian and others. They can charge at up to 400 kilowatts, a faster pace than any EV currently sold in America, backed by compatible chargers that are now coming online from providers such as the new Ionna network; or in Europe, from Ionity. On the right charger, the iX4 can add 350 kilometers of driving range (217 miles) in just 10 minutes, or a 10-to-80 percent charge in 15 minutes—fast enough to quiet EV naysayers.

BMW’s former prismatic cells give way to new Generation 6 cylindrical batteries, developed in-house at the automaker’s new Battery Competence Center, in a partnership with China’s CATL. BMW says those cylindrical cells will boost energy density by 20 percent, including higher nickel content in cathodes and more silicon in anodes. For the iX3, that’s enough to deliver a generous 560 kilometers of range under the European Union’s WLTP testing regime, or 400 miles by the more real-world estimates of U.S. EPA standards. That’s a healthy 30-percent jump in driving range in a single EV generation, driven by new batteries and reductions in aerodynamic drag and powertrain energy losses.

A sunken compartment inside the BMW iX3 holds the car’s charger.BMW

Remarkably, BMW says that 50 percent of the batteries’ lithium, cobalt, and nickel will come from recycled materials. These cylindrical cells replace BMW’s previous prismatic design, in two form factors depending on the model application: A 46-mm diameter and either a 95-mm or 120-mm height. Those cells line up neatly in packs with no space-wasting modules that require individual wiring. “Pack-to-body” construction saves more space and mass: The battery’s metal upper housing actually forms the floor of the cabin (below the carpeting of course). The iX3 crams 108 kilowatt-hours of energy into roughly the same space as the automaker’s previous battery.",https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=61534248&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C528%2C0%2C471,N,,2025-09-05 12:10:20.140630

In a recent report, PUD Director Mark Argenbright explained there were 540 electric vehicle charging ports available to the public in 2023. It grew to 640 in 2024. He informed commissioners the number is expected to increase to 740 this year.

As mandated by state law, OAC 165:14-3-5, the Corporation Commission is responsible for regulation of the public EV ports.

But Argenbright also explained one of the challenges of seeing more EV charging ports installed is the required meter accuracy testing, again part of the law, OAC 165:14-5-5(c).

Because there are two kinds of chargers, DC and AC, it has proven to be a challenge for more installation and the mandated testing.

“DC and AC chargers are fundamentally different. AC metering technology is well understood. DC metering technology has been in research and development for the last few years. Accordingly, there is a lack of equipment available for DC meters. The technology and the market will ultimately drive the availability as well as the cost,” explained Argenbright in an email to OK Energy Today.

The Oklahoma Department of Transportation received $66 million in funding originally from the Biden administration for installation of charging ports on turnpikes and highways.

T.J. Gerlach, a Public Information Officer with ODOT told OK Energy Today that $1.6 million was spent on the planning requirements of the program.

“The first round of installation awards was for $9 million for 13 sites. None have been installed to date.”

“We’re working with our partners at FHWA to revise our NEVI plan to align with the new guidance that we received just a few weeks ago. This new plan is due this month and then it needs to be approved before we can move forward with NEVI activities,” added Gerlach.

“ODOT was originally apportioned $66 million of the total $5 billion nationwide. As of now, we expect to receive this full amount.”",,N,,2025-09-05 11:07:47.132027

The Trudeau electric vehicle standard raised the bar over time so that by 2035, all new cars and light trucks sold in Canada would have to be emissions-free.
“These targets were made up by the government, not based on any sound assessment of real market dynamics,” Brian Kingston, chief executive officer of the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers’ Association, said in an interview in August.
Top photo: An electric vehicle at a charging station in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.","Canada is delaying a plan to force automakers to hit minimum sales levels for electric vehicles by 2026, a concession to manufacturers in a sector that has been upended by tariffs.

Prime Minister Mark Carney’s government will make the announcement Friday as one of a series of measures to help companies in the industries most affected by US President Donald Trump’s trade war, according to people familiar with the matter, speaking on condition they not be identified.

Carney’s predecessor, Justin Trudeau, had passed rules that required automakers to ensure that at least 20% of sales were zero-emission vehicles by the model year 2026. But the government won’t implement that target now: instead, it will launch a review of the so-called “electric vehicle availability standard” to make sure it doesn’t create burdens on automakers, the people said.

It’s another illustration of how Carney, who took over in March, is unwinding some policies of the Trudeau era, partly because of the pressures of the trade war. The prime minister has withdrawn many retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products, scrapped a carbon tax on consumers’ use of fossil fuels and ditched a new tax on digital services after Trump complained about it.

The auto industry has been lobbying for months to change the EV mandate, arguing that the targets were unrealistic and would add costs and put jobs at risk.

In June, about 8% of new vehicles sold in Canada were zero-emission. The percentage has declined this year because the federal government cut off a consumer incentive that had offered as much as C$5,000 ($3,622) to buyers of clean-energy vehicles, saying the program had run out of money.

The Trudeau electric vehicle standard raised the bar over time so that by 2035, all new cars and light trucks sold in Canada would have to be emissions-free.

“These targets were made up by the government, not based on any sound assessment of real market dynamics,” Brian Kingston, chief executive officer of the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers’ Association, said in an interview in August. The CVMA represents General Motors Co., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler parent Stellantis NV, all of which have manufacturing operations in the province of Ontario.

Under the electric vehicle mandate, manufacturers that failed to meet the sales targets would likely have been forced to restrict sales of internal combustion engine vehicles or buy credits from companies like Tesla Inc., Kingston said.

Automakers around the world are facing higher costs from U.S. tariffs, and EV manufacturers are also facing pressures from U.S. moves to gut fuel-efficiency rules and remove consumer tax credits for buying EVs.

The Canadian industry is highly integrated with the American auto sector: The country exports most of its vehicle production to the US, and imports more American cars and trucks than anywhere else. For that reason, automotive regulations in Canada have long tended to be similar to those in the U.S.

But the industry is now under threat from the Trump administration’s tariffs on foreign-made vehicles. GM and Stellantis have both curtailed production and reduced shifts at assembly plants in the province of Ontario since the trade war began.

When Trump imposed those tariffs in April, Canada retaliated by putting its own levies on U.S.-made vehicles — essentially matching the White House move.

But Carney’s government also gave automakers a way to apply for tariff relief, as long as they keep their production and investment in Canada.

The 2026 Chevy BrightDrop was originally scheduled to begin production on July 14th, 2025. We reported in May that BrightDrop production would be idled until October. Now, the pause is extended once again through November 17th. When the CAMI plant in Ingersoll, Ontario, resumes production of the BrightDrop, it will indefinitely be limited to just one shift.

“General Motors is making strategic production adjustments in alignment with expected slower EV industry growth and customer demand by leveraging our flexible ICE and EV manufacturing footprint,” GM spokesman Kevin Kelly said in a statement.”GM’s U.S. manufacturing footprint remains our strength, and we are in the process of investing nearly $5 billion over the next two years to further increase domestic vehicle production, enabling the ability to assemble more than 2 million vehicles per year in the U.S.”

In other news related to EV production slowdowns, it was recently confirmed that production of the Cadillac Lyriq and Vistiq electric luxury crossovers in Spring Hill, Tennessee, will pause in December and resume at one shift in 2026. Similarly, production of the next-generation Chevy Bolt EV will be limited to one shift for the foreseeable future when its regular production at the Fairfax plant in Kansas begins later this year.

Production is currently idled for the GMC Hummer EV and Cadillac Escalade IQ at Factory Zero in Michigan and is expected to resume in October. Meanwhile, the Lake Orion facility that was originally planned to be retooled for electric truck production will be used to build ICE-powered trucks and SUVs instead.

This news comes as the American auto industry prepares for the end of the federal EV tax credit, which is good for up to $7,500 on a new EV and $4,000 on a used EV.

Tesla, which is leaning heavily into robotics and AI, said in a regulatory filing on Friday that the package has a dozen share tranches that include awards for Musk if targets, ranging from car production to the total value of the company, are met over that time period.

Very early in the plan, Tesla would have to reach a market valuation of $2 trillion and achieve 20 million vehicles deliveries. Tesla delivered less than 2 million vehicles in 2024.

That milestone would also required a million robotaxis in commercial operation and the delivery of 1 million artificial intelligence bots.

Musk needs to remain with Tesla for at least seven and a half years to cash out on any stock, and 10 years to earn the full amount.

Musk has been one of the richest people in the world for several years.

Musk would also receive more voting power over Tesla under the proposed plan. The EV company is set to hold its annual shareholders meeting on Nov. 6. Tesla’s last shareholders meeting was on June 13 of last year, where investors voted to restore Musk’s record $44.9 billion pay package that was thrown out by a Delaware judge earlier that year.

A condition of the 11th and 12th tranches of the plan includes Musk coming up with a framework for someone to succeed him as CEO.

The goals set out for Musk and Tesla are extremely ambitious given recent tumult at the Texas company.

Tesla shares have plunged 25% this year largely due to blowback over Musk’s affiliation with President Donald Trump. But Tesla also faces intensifying competition from the big Detroit automakers and particularly from China.

Telsa sales have fallen precipitously in Europe after Musk aligned with a far-right political party in German.

Sales plunged 40% in July in the 27 European Union countries compared with the year earlier even as sales overall of electric vehicle soared, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association. Meanwhile sales of Chinese rival BYD continued to climb fast, grabbing 1.1% market share of all car sales in the month versus Tesla’s 0.7%.

In its most recent quarter, Tesla reported that quarterly profits plunged from $1.39 billion to $409 million. Revenue also fell and the company fell short of even the lowered expectations on Wall Street.

Investors have grown increasingly worried about the trajectory of the company after Musk had spent so much time in Washington this year, becoming one of the most prominent officials in the Trump administration in its bid to slash the size of the U.S. government.

Last month Tesla said that it gave Musk a stock grant of $29 billion as a reward for years of “transformative and unprecedented” growth despite a recent foray into right-wing politics that has hurt its sales, profits and its stock price.

The award arrived eight months after a judge revoked Musk’s 2018 pay package for a second time, something the company noted in August. Tesla has appealed the ruling.

Tesla said at the time that the grant was a “first step, good faith” way of retaining Musk and keeping him focused, citing his leadership of SpaceX, xAI and other companies. Musk said recently that he needed more shares and control so he couldn’t be ousted by shareholder activists.

Starting that October, it implemented a 25 per cent surtax on Chinese steel and aluminum as well as a 100 per cent surtax on Chinese-made electric vehicles.

China’s decision to levy a 76 per cent tariff on canola seed has been viewed as coming in direct response to Canada’s levy on Chinese electric vehicles.

A spokeswoman for François Philippe-Champagne says imports of these Chinese products “have declined significantly since their imposition,” adding that the government had committed to review these surtaxes one year after they were implemented last October.

“Officials are currently undertaking work on this review, including an assessment of China’s policies and trade practices, and whether the scope of the surtaxes, as well as the surtax rate, remain appropriate,” Audrey Milette said in a statement to National Post, late Thursday.

“The government will continue to provide updates as relevant.” The review itself is set to begin next month.

The statement comes the same day that the Prime Minister’s Office announced it was sending a representative on an upcoming trade mission to China and lands amid pressure from Western premiers to drop its tariff on Chinese-made electric vehicles in an effort to see China lift its tariff on canola.

In August 2024, former finance minister and deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland announced measures that the government characterized as designed to “level the playing field” for Canadian workers in both the steel and aluminum industries and the auto sector.

Starting that October, it implemented a 25 per cent surtax on Chinese steel and aluminum as well as a 100 per cent surtax on Chinese-made electric vehicles.

The Liberal government said the measures were in response to unfair competition and labour practices from China, particularly when it came to electric vehicles, given that China is the world’s largest exporter.

Officials heard that Canada’s importation of Chinese electric vehicles, which are the cheapest to buy, posed a threat to the future development of the North American market in the sector.

Its decision to levy a 100 per cent tariff on Chinese electric vehicles followed suit with an earlier move by former U.S. president Joe Biden, whose administration hiked its own tariffs on these vehicles to 100 per cent.

U.S. officials had also cited potential national security concerns related to how these vehicles were internet-connected.

Earlier on Thursday, the Prime Minister’s Office announced that Kody Blois, Carney’s parliamentary secretary, would be traveling to China as part of a trade delegation led by Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe to address numerous “trade irritants,” including tariffs on Canadian canola.

China’s decision to levy a 76 per cent tariff on canola seed has been viewed as coming in direct response to Canada’s levy on Chinese electric vehicles.

Both Moe and Alberta Premier Danielle Smith have been calling on the federal government to remove its tariff on Chinese electric vehicles in an effort to see the dispute resolved.

The Prime Minister’s Office, in the statement announcing Blois’s travel, said it was taking steps to protect the jobs tied to Canada’s canola industry and would be announcing “additional measures in support of Canadian producers shortly.”

Sources say Carney is expected to make a wide-spanning, national-level economic announcement on Friday in Toronto, where Carney has spent the past two days meeting with his cabinet before the House of Commons resumes on Sept.15.

On Thursday, Industry Minister Mélanie Joly said there would be an announcement “in the coming days” to support Canadian industries hit by U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs.

Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Carney said there was room for trade to grow between China and Canada, namely in agriculture.

“We have differences with China, different approaches to a variety of things, but they are our second largest trading partner,” he said.

“Look at the issues around canola at present and our broader agricultural export: pea protein, other aspects and fisheries. We’re going to work hard to get that right,” he added.

“Within that context, there may be areas where… we can expand the commercial relationship with things that China does well.”

(CNN) — America’s aging power grid has faced strain for years, exacerbated by severe weather events, an explosion of data centers and the demand created by artificial intelligence.

Now, electricity is emerging as a top issue on the campaign trail.

Campaigns in this fall’s races for New Jersey and Virginia governors, as well as candidates in the upcoming midterms, are taking note of surging utility bills, in the latest sign that affordability has become central to campaigns at all levels.

In her first general election campaign ad, US Rep. Mikie Sherrill, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee in New Jersey, declares that on “Day One as governor, I’m declaring a state of emergency on utility costs, using emergency powers to end these rate hikes and drive down your bills.”

Jack Ciattarelli, Sherrill’s GOP opponent, unveiled his own first-day plan calling for more energy generation.

“We need to expand our nuclear capabilities in South Jersey, we need to accelerate solar, we can’t rely on wind,” Ciattarelli said on Fox News recently, laying blame with the outgoing Democratic administration of Gov. Phil Murphy.

Three leading Democratic organizations spent $8 million on an August ad campaign that linked rising electricity bills to GOP policymaking, arguing that the “One Big, Beautiful Bill” passed this summer “removes clean energy from the electric grid, creating a massive rate hike on electricity.”

Americans for Prosperity, a leading conservative group, launched a seven-figure ad campaign urging lawmakers “to unleash America’s energy potential by cutting red tape and eliminating counterproductive regulations.”

Energy Secretary Chris Wright has acknowledged the looming challenge both for power generation and for Republicans politically.

“It’s what I worry about most seven days a week,” he told Fox Business. “We want to stop the rise in electricity for Americans.”

Speaking to Politico, Wright was even more frank.

“Who’s going to get blamed for it? We’re going to get blamed because we’re in office.”

The Department of Energy, meanwhile, blamed the Biden administration’s policies for driving up electricity prices, and pointed to its efforts to “meet this rising power demand, fueled in part by the buildout of AI and data centers.”

“With President Trump’s leadership, the Department of Energy is reversing course: Ending subsidies that supported more expensive, less reliable energy, reversing policies that forced the premature closure of baseload power sources and expanding access to affordable, reliable, secure energy 24/7,” said Emery Washington, a spokesperson for the department.

“DOE is pursuing a strategy of energy addition—reforming costly permitting processes, keeping base load power online, and building more energy infrastructure needed to keep the lights and energy prices low for the American people.”

The power problem

The cost of power has set a record for two consecutive years in the country’s largest grid, covering a wide swath of competitive political territory that includes parts of Pennsylvania, Michigan, North Carolina, Virginia and New Jersey.

According to a May report from the US Energy Information Administration, “retail electricity prices have increased faster than the rate of inflation since 2022, and we expect them to continue increasing through 2026.”

The EIA separately noted this summer that “residential electricity prices in the Pacific, Middle Atlantic, and New England census divisions—regions where consumers already pay much more per kilowatt hour for electricity—could increase more than the national average.”

A big reason why is data centers. Campuses are springing up across the country, powering artificial intelligence technology and offering sought-after economic development. Their energy needs are enormous, however, with some data centers drawing as much power as 800,000 homes.

In Virginia – dubbed by one state industry group as the “data center capital of the world” – data centers consumed nearly a quarter of the electricity generated in the state in 2023, according to the Electric Power Research Institute, an independent nonprofit.

A report from the Department of Energy last year, meanwhile, estimated that data center energy use “is projected to double or triple by 2028.”

Spiking demand is driving bills up for individuals. In New Jersey, residential rates have climbed by up to 20%, and the tri-state Regional Plan Association found that “increased demand from data centers is attributed to about two-thirds of the increased prices.”

It’s also putting tremendous pressure on power grids that are already strained. According to another Energy Department report, “our aging infrastructure is struggling to meet our modern electricity needs,” and “70 percent of transmission lines are over 25 years old.” Studies from Pennsylvania State University and Columbia University have also linked grid vulnerabilities to increasing severe weather events.

According to an analysis from Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan think tank, power generation capacity could fall by 340 gigawatts by 2035, with one gigawatt being enough to power up to 1 million homes, while household energy costs could increase $170 annually due to the lost subsidies resulting from the “One, Big Beautiful Bill” passed over the summer.

The campaigns respond

Democrats argue that surging demand validates their support for alternative energy sources, pointing to President Donald Trump and Republicans slashing clean energy tax credits and canceling work on a nearly complete wind farm in Rhode Island. Republicans say it’s all the more reason to deregulate and ramp up fossil-fuel production.

Sherrill is positioning herself in the debate. “New Jersey isn’t generating even close to enough in-state power to keep costs low, and we risk missing the clean energy targets that we need to protect our environment for generations to come. I’m not going to accept that,” she wrote in her “Day One Declaration” plan.

Ciattarelli also called out high electricity costs in his first general election campaign ad, pushing back on his rival’s critiques. “All Mikie Sherrill wants to talk about is President Trump. Come on, what does the president have to do with rising property taxes and higher electricity bills?” he says. “I’ll lower electricity bills.”

Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic nominee for governor in Virginia, unveiled a suite of policy proposals aimed at lowering energy costs, including a focus on local generation, weatherization, and regulatory reform. Notably, Spanberger’s plan referenced “making sure data centers don’t drive up energy costs for everyone else in Virginia.”

Additionally, Spanberger and a few others have made the connection between AI data centers and spiking electricity bills. It opens a fraught debate about the rising cost of electricity to operate a technology, artificial intelligence, that could threaten some voters’ jobs.

And the Virginia League of Conservation Voters, a branch of the leading environmental group, is up with an ad blaming Republicans for higher bills, saying “big energy is raising prices” and arguing that “Virginia Republicans are helping big corporations rip you off.”",https://kion546.b-cdn.net/2023/10/kionlogog-860x540.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 14:05:28.087028

Renewable diesel imports averaged 5,000 b/d, down from 33,000 b/d in 1H24.
One key reason for the sharp drop in biodiesel and renewable diesel imports in early 2025 is the loss in tax credits for imported biofuels.
Before 2025, both imported and domestically produced biodiesel and renewable diesel received a $1 per gallon blender’s tax credit (BTC).
Although we do not explicitly forecast biodiesel and renewable diesel imports in the Short-Term Energy Outlook, we do forecast U.S. net imports.","U.S. imports of biodiesel and renewable diesel significantly decreased in the first half of 2025 (1H25) compared with the same period in previous years. This decline is primarily due to the loss of tax credits for imported biofuels and generally lower domestic consumption of these fuels.

Renewable diesel and biodiesel are biomass-based diesel fuels that can replace petroleum-based distillate and be used to comply with the Renewable Fuel Standard blending requirements for refiners administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

In 1H25, U.S. biodiesel imports averaged 2,000 barrels per day (b/d), a sharp drop from 35,000 b/d in 1H24. Renewable diesel imports averaged 5,000 b/d, down from 33,000 b/d in 1H24. These import levels were the lowest for the first half of any year since 2012, when U.S. biodiesel consumption was less than half of 2024 levels and renewable diesel consumption was negligible.

One key reason for the sharp drop in biodiesel and renewable diesel imports in early 2025 is the loss in tax credits for imported biofuels. Before 2025, both imported and domestically produced biodiesel and renewable diesel received a $1 per gallon blender’s tax credit (BTC). The Inflation Reduction Act replaced the BTC with the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit in 2025, which only applies to domestic production. This tax credit change placed imports at a relative economic disadvantage.

A second reason biodiesel and renewable diesel imports dropped in 1H25 was low U.S. consumption of these fuels because of uncertainty around blending requirements and negative profit margins for blending biofuels. Compared with 1H24, U.S. consumption of renewable diesel was down about 30% in 1H25, and biodiesel consumption was down about 40%. This lower consumption reduced demand for both imported and domestically produced biofuels.

The combination of poor blending margins and the relative economic disadvantage for imported biofuels led domestic blenders to rely on domestically produced biofuels for the smaller amounts they were blending. As a result, international biofuel producers found fewer profitable opportunities to send product to the United States. For example, Neste, the producer of all of the renewable diesel imported to the United States, reported a lower share of exports going to the United States in 1H25 than in 1H24. Looking ahead, we expect U.S. consumption of biodiesel and renewable diesel to increase as the year progresses to meet existing RFS mandates, but imports of the fuels will likely remain low because of the change in tax policy.

Although we do not explicitly forecast biodiesel and renewable diesel imports in the Short-Term Energy Outlook, we do forecast U.S. net imports. We assume low imports for both products in the forecast period and forecast U.S. biodiesel net imports in 2025 and 2026 to be their lowest since 2012.

The report identifies the primary sources of greenhouse gas emissions in the region and pinpoints the most effective actions to reduce emissions and build a more resilient future.

The analysis finds that in 2022, the Project 46 region produced 4.2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, with the most significant contributions coming from gasoline and diesel vehicles (35 percent), as well as the use of electricity and natural gas in residential (20 percent) and commercial (15 percent) buildings.

Under current trends, including improvements in vehicle fuel efficiency, grid modernization, and existing policies, the region is projected to reduce emissions by 33 percent by 2030. However, if all recommended high-impact actions are implemented, the area could achieve an additional 6 percent reduction, resulting in a total of 39 percent decrease in emissions by 2030.

The report identifies three actions with the most significant potential impact:

Increasing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs)

Conducting energy efficiency retrofits in residential and commercial buildings

Diverting waste to composting and recycling instead of landfills

“Climate work gives us a compass,” said Bloomington Mayor Kerry Thomson, a Project 46 Steering Committee member. “When neighbors, cities, and counties row in the same direction, we create communities where people want to live, work, and dream. That’s the promise of Project 46. It’s a collaboration that turns ideas into a more resilient southern Indiana.”

The Midwest is already experiencing the impacts of shifting climate patterns, including changes in agricultural productivity and infrastructure challenges caused by rising temperatures.

In California, energy curtailments, i.e., the reduction or closure of clean energy systems, have seen a 29 percent increase since 2023.
Abolishing CEQA and implementing a connect-and-manage approach would enable the Golden State to meet its green energy goals.","Gavin Newsom has doubled down on the idea that California must reach net-zero emissions by 2045. Yet, the Golden State’s heavy hand has likely made meeting this timeline implausible. Two-thirds of the state might be powered by renewable energy now, but red tape has compromised real progress.

Some critics argue that green energy hasn’t taken off around the country because of bureaucratic issues, but rather because of special interests such as “big oil” or climate change denial. San Francisco congressional candidate Saikat Chakrabarti and Fordham University law professor Zephyr Teachout, who voiced this opinion in a debate with Ezra Klein, have expressed this viewpoint.

Klein, one of the prominent voices of the “abundance movement,” emphasized that this argument fails to explain why some states see more growth in green energy than others. In 2024, 34 percent of electricity in Texas was generated through wind and solar, a massive jump from only 12 percent in 2015. Unlike California, Texas has no statewide mandate for clean energy. Although Texas is synonymous with big oil, several anti-renewable legislation bills failed to pass in 2025.

It is estimated that wind and solar saved Texas consumers a staggering $28 billion between 2010 and 2022. Meanwhile, Californians pay nearly double for electricity compared to Texas and are not reaping the rewards. Texas’s relatively liberal permitting environment incentivizes innovation and competitive pricing, which leads to energy costs that are 60 percent lower than those in the Golden State.

In California, energy curtailments, i.e., the reduction or closure of clean energy systems, have seen a 29 percent increase since 2023. The grid system in the state cannot harness the output of wind and solar being produced. Regulations must be slashed to maximize the amount of energy being created. As of 2024, California was home to a renewable workforce of 545,000, the highest in the country—yet the state still trails behind the clean energy output of Texas and its 262,000 workers. A state that prides itself on being at the forefront of renewables is underperforming against a state with less than half the workforce.

In its current condition, California stands no chance of reaching total clean energy autonomy. Multiple regulatory agencies in the state have created a bureaucratic bottleneck. Approval for new transmission projects can take close to a decade. No one is building because everyone is waiting.

To build new infrastructure in California, agencies need to go through assessment processes such as the California Environmental Quality Act, which can take years to conclude. CEQA is often abused by NIMBY (“not in my backyard”) activists, who can make it almost impossible to build new infrastructure. After CEQA approval, a project must be approved by the California Public Utilities Commission to receive a “certificate of public convenience and necessity”—a process that can take as long as nineteen months, nearly two years for a single permit, before construction starts.

Meanwhile, Texas uses a “connect and manage” approach. Projects are connected to the grid and tested in real time. California is an embodiment of bureaucracy at its worst, requiring years of studies and waiting before progress is made—the opposite of “progressive.” Texas, on the other hand, streamlines projects and enables building. At the same time that it takes one project to be approved in California, multiple projects can already be finished in the Lone Star State.

California needs to follow Texas by slashing the red tape that holds progress back. Abolishing CEQA and implementing a connect-and-manage approach would enable the Golden State to meet its green energy goals. Texas has proven that competition in renewables works, and California must take note if it wants to reach its lofty goals.",https://www.independent.org/wp-content/uploads/article/2025/08/pexels-pixabay-433308-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 11:04:22.780054

Trump is forcing it to stay open. - Grist Magazine,Rebecca Egan McCarthy,,,,,https://grist.org/justice/nobody-wants-this-gas-plant-trump-is-forcing-it-to-stay-open/,"The Trump administration, citing an ongoing “energy emergency,” has once again saddled a community already overburdened by pollution with a dirty, obsolete power plant it doesn’t want or need.
The Department of Energy issued what’s called an emergency stay open order for Constellation Energy’s gas-fired power plant in Eddystone, Pennsylvania, on August 27.
Constellation Energy’s gas plant in Eddystone began operation in the early 1960s and currently provides about 782 megawatts to the surrounding region.
Despite the administration’s dire warnings of an energy emergency, it has moved aggressively to shut down renewable energy projects that would provide more electricity.
The emergency stay open order will likely increase costs for ratepayers, Routh explained.","The Trump administration, citing an ongoing “energy emergency,” has once again saddled a community already overburdened by pollution with a dirty, obsolete power plant it doesn’t want or need. The decision has confounded residents and environmental justice advocates, who called the move an abuse of federal law and a lost opportunity to improve the area’s air quality.

The Department of Energy issued what’s called an emergency stay open order for Constellation Energy’s gas-fired power plant in Eddystone, Pennsylvania, on August 27. It is the second time since May the agency has taken this step, and amounts to “an extraordinary and unprecedented” use of the Federal Power Act, said Robert Routh of the National Resources Defense Council.

The NRDC, along with the Sierra Club, The Clean Air Council, and several other environmental groups, is challenging the decision. Emergency stay open orders have previously been reserved for wartime conditions or natural disasters, said Routh, who is the Pennsylvania policy director for the organization. “This is an abuse of an extraordinary authority reserved for emergency situations,” he said, noting that the short-term need for increased electricity the administration cited in defending the move would not justify keeping the facility open. “They are concocting the emergency situation in order to justify keeping a dirty fossil plant online past its retirement date.”

Eddystone lies just outside Philadelphia, at the head of a 12-mile industrial corridor that stretches to the town of Marcus Hook and is generally considered one of the most toxic areas in the state. Today, it’s home to myriad hazardous industries, including the nation’s largest trash incinerator, chemical plants, and refineries. Childhood asthma rates in the region are four times the national average, and the rates of some forms of cancer are more than 1,000 times higher.

Constellation Energy’s gas plant in Eddystone began operation in the early 1960s and currently provides about 782 megawatts to the surrounding region. It has run only sporadically in recent years, in large part because it simply was not economical to operate consistently. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, it emitted 23,102 metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2022, 16 tons of methane, and 31 tons of nitrous oxide. Grid operator PJM approved Constellation’s shutdown request for the plant in December of 2023 after finding that the closure would not adversely impact the grid, and the facility was scheduled to close May 31. But, one day before the closure, the Department of Energy, or DOE, ordered the plant to continue operating. The agency reissued that order when it expired last week.

Although environmental advocates argue the emergency order is a manufactured crisis, the DOE cited summer heatwaves as the rationale for keeping the plant open, noting that the “Eddystone units were called on by PJM to generate electricity during heat waves that hit the region in June and July.” The grid operator did not respond when asked if closing the plant would have caused blackouts — something that would not have been considered in its decision to approve the facility’s closure, because PJM cannot deny a closure solely on those grounds. But PJM said it supported extending the emergency order. Constellation Energy blamed the rapid expansion of the data centers powering artificial intelligence, saying that it is “continuing to work with the Department of Energy and PJM in taking emergency measures to meet the need for power at this critical time when America must win the AI race.”

In July, Trump and Pennsylvania Senator Dave McCormick announced the private sector had promised $90 billion in funding to turn Pennsylvania into a hub for data centers. This has drawn concern from environmental advocates, who worry that the promise of corporate investment will provide a handy excuse to prolong the life of oil and liquid natural gas in order to generate electricity for hypothetical data centers.

“We have not yet seen that demand that everyone is talking about from the data centers,” said Jessica O’Neill, managing attorney at PennFuture, an environmental advocacy nonprofit. “In Pennsylvania, we just seem to fall over ourselves, again and again, to attract new industry.” Her concern, she explained, was that the state would build speculative gas plants or extend the life of aging plants in the service of an industry that might never materialize.

When Constellation’s shutdown request was approved almost two years ago, the grid operator noted that the plant’s closure would not cause “any reliability violations,” or leave the region at risk of blackouts.” Both Routh and O’Neill noted that PJM’s interconnection crisis has left many renewable energy projects in limbo as they wait to be brought onto the grid. Despite the administration’s dire warnings of an energy emergency, it has moved aggressively to shut down renewable energy projects that would provide more electricity.

“I personally think it’s interesting that they’re justifying the stay open order on the grounds that there’s an energy emergency, because that has not been shown to be the case,” said Lauren Minsky, a medical historian and professor of environmental health at Haverford College. “And what there clearly is, is a public health emergency.” As part of her work, Minsky has been tracking community cancer rates in the industrial stretch between Eddystone and Marcus Hook. Pediatric Hodgkin’s Lymphoma rates in Eddystone are 1051 percent higher than the national average; youth uterine cancer rates are 1813 percent higher.

The emergency stay open order will likely increase costs for ratepayers, Routh explained. Because the order came down just a day before the plant was to retire, Constellation Energy had to abruptly order an enormous amount of fuel and tackle deferred maintenance it never expected to deal with. “Those costs are going to be shifted to ratepayers,” said Routh. “Whereas this plant otherwise would not have been operating. This is an unprecedented use of this authority, and it’s done in a way that doesn’t make sense even on its own face.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25153685755115.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-09-05 11:03:13.250367

That also means that another cold winter could bring significant price shocks, exceeding those of last winter.
Other factors could have an impact on natural gas prices this winter as well.
Record liquified natural gas exports could put a strain on domestic supplies.
With energy prices rising as they are, it’s more important than ever to find ways to save.","If you thought your utility bills last winter were bad, they could be even worse this coming winter. Electricity costs have risen by an average of 6.5% nationwide since last year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. If you live in New York, your rates have risen by 13%, while folks in Louisiana have seen an increase of over 14%. In fact, 13 states across the country have seen electricity rates rise by more than 10% in the last year, and those rates are expected to continue to rise through at least 2026. Last year, the story of skyrocketing energy bills pointed to cold temperatures and rising natural gas prices as the culprit; the story this year is that it won’t have to be as cold for your bills to be as high, because the prices are simply higher this year than last. That also means that another cold winter could bring significant price shocks, exceeding those of last winter.

The news is not all bad, according to the EIA we have been able to restore our natural gas storage levels to the five-year average. High natural gas prices last year were driven by cold temperatures depleting our storage levels, and there were concerns we would not be able to restore it for this winter, but with record natural gas production levels, we have. Natural gas provides the fuel that generates 40% of our electricity. If we don’t experience the cold temperatures we had last year, natural gas prices are not expected to return to those levels this winter. With the unpredictable weather patterns that come with climate change, anything is possible when it comes to that.

Other factors could have an impact on natural gas prices this winter as well. Record liquified natural gas exports could put a strain on domestic supplies. Another reason we were able to restore inventory levels this summer is that multiple LNG terminals were undergoing maintenance, which caused our exports to drop significantly during the critical summer months when we want to build that inventory of gas. Those record exports will be happening again this winter when prices are the most volatile. LNG exports this year are up by 22% over last year, according to the commodities intelligence firm Kpler.

Prepare Yourself

In the spring, I gave you some tips on how to prepare your home for summer weather, so it only made sense to do the same for winter. If you live in the south, you may think you don’t need to do some of these things, and that’s understandable. I will remind you that places in Florida last winter had nearly ten inches of snow in a day.

· Inspect your furnace or heat pump; this should be done every fall. Replace filters if necessary.

· Make sure you check your safety devices, like carbon monoxide detectors and smoke alarms.

· Check the weatherstripping on your windows and doors or use caulk to seal leaks. You can also use curtains or window film to slow down air flow.

· If you can add insulation to attics or walls, especially attics, as they are a massive source of energy loss.

· If you have a fireplace, you might have your chimney swept if needed.

· Insulate any exposed water pipes

· If you have a generator, you may consider having it checked, or if you can get one.

· Make sure you have plenty of batteries and flashlights.

· Keep blankets, water, and non-perishable food handy.

· Clean your gutters; this will prevent ice buildup.

Now, electricity is emerging as a top issue on the campaign trail.

Campaigns in this fall’s races for New Jersey and Virginia governors, as well as candidates in the upcoming midterms, are taking note of surging utility bills, in the latest sign that affordability has become central to campaigns at all levels.

In her first general election campaign ad, US Rep. Mikie Sherrill, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee in New Jersey, declares that on “Day One as governor, I’m declaring a state of emergency on utility costs, using emergency powers to end these rate hikes and drive down your bills.”

Jack Ciattarelli, Sherrill’s GOP opponent, unveiled his own first-day plan calling for more energy generation.

“We need to expand our nuclear capabilities in South Jersey, we need to accelerate solar, we can’t rely on wind,” Ciattarelli said on Fox News recently, laying blame with the outgoing Democratic administration of Gov. Phil Murphy.

Three leading Democratic organizations spent $8 million on an August ad campaign that linked rising electricity bills to GOP policymaking, arguing that the “One Big, Beautiful Bill” passed this summer “removes clean energy from the electric grid, creating a massive rate hike on electricity.”

Americans for Prosperity, a leading conservative group, launched a seven-figure ad campaign urging lawmakers “to unleash America’s energy potential by cutting red tape and eliminating counterproductive regulations.”

Energy Secretary Chris Wright has acknowledged the looming challenge both for power generation and for Republicans politically.

“It’s what I worry about most seven days a week,” he told Fox Business. “We want to stop the rise in electricity for Americans.”

Speaking to Politico, Wright was even more frank.

“Who’s going to get blamed for it? We’re going to get blamed because we’re in office.”

The Department of Energy, meanwhile, blamed the Biden administration’s policies for driving up electricity prices, and pointed to its efforts to “meet this rising power demand, fueled in part by the buildout of AI and data centers.”

“With President Trump’s leadership, the Department of Energy is reversing course: Ending subsidies that supported more expensive, less reliable energy, reversing policies that forced the premature closure of baseload power sources and expanding access to affordable, reliable, secure energy 24/7,” said Emery Washington, a spokesperson for the department.

“DOE is pursuing a strategy of energy addition—reforming costly permitting processes, keeping base load power online, and building more energy infrastructure needed to keep the lights and energy prices low for the American people.”

The power problem

The cost of power has set a record for two consecutive years in the country’s largest grid, covering a wide swath of competitive political territory that includes parts of Pennsylvania, Michigan, North Carolina, Virginia and New Jersey.

According to a May report from the US Energy Information Administration, “retail electricity prices have increased faster than the rate of inflation since 2022, and we expect them to continue increasing through 2026.”

The EIA separately noted this summer that “residential electricity prices in the Pacific, Middle Atlantic, and New England census divisions—regions where consumers already pay much more per kilowatt hour for electricity—could increase more than the national average.”

A big reason why is data centers. Campuses are springing up across the country, powering artificial intelligence technology and offering sought-after economic development. Their energy needs are enormous, however, with some data centers drawing as much power as 800,000 homes.

In Virginia – dubbed by one state industry group as the “data center capital of the world” – data centers consumed nearly a quarter of the electricity generated in the state in 2023, according to the Electric Power Research Institute, an independent nonprofit.

A report from the Department of Energy last year, meanwhile, estimated that data center energy use “is projected to double or triple by 2028.”

Spiking demand is driving bills up for individuals. In New Jersey, residential rates have climbed by up to 20%, and the tri-state Regional Plan Association found that “increased demand from data centers is attributed to about two-thirds of the increased prices.”

It’s also putting tremendous pressure on power grids that are already strained. According to another Energy Department report, “our aging infrastructure is struggling to meet our modern electricity needs,” and “70 percent of transmission lines are over 25 years old.” Studies from Pennsylvania State University and Columbia University have also linked grid vulnerabilities to increasing severe weather events.

According to an analysis from Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan think tank, power generation capacity could fall by 340 gigawatts by 2035, with one gigawatt being enough to power up to 1 million homes, while household energy costs could increase $170 annually due to the lost subsidies resulting from the “One, Big Beautiful Bill” passed over the summer.

The campaigns respond

Democrats argue that surging demand validates their support for alternative energy sources, pointing to President Donald Trump and Republicans slashing clean energy tax credits and canceling work on a nearly complete wind farm in Rhode Island. Republicans say it’s all the more reason to deregulate and ramp up fossil-fuel production.

Sherrill is positioning herself in the debate. “New Jersey isn’t generating even close to enough in-state power to keep costs low, and we risk missing the clean energy targets that we need to protect our environment for generations to come. I’m not going to accept that,” she wrote in her “Day One Declaration” plan.

Ciattarelli also called out high electricity costs in his first general election campaign ad, pushing back on his rival’s critiques. “All Mikie Sherrill wants to talk about is President Trump. Come on, what does the president have to do with rising property taxes and higher electricity bills?” he says. “I’ll lower electricity bills.”

Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic nominee for governor in Virginia, unveiled a suite of policy proposals aimed at lowering energy costs, including a focus on local generation, weatherization, and regulatory reform. Notably, Spanberger’s plan referenced “making sure data centers don’t drive up energy costs for everyone else in Virginia.”

Additionally, Spanberger and a few others have made the connection between AI data centers and spiking electricity bills. It opens a fraught debate about the rising cost of electricity to operate a technology, artificial intelligence, that could threaten some voters’ jobs.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2231894704.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-09-05 11:03:17.791953

The 76-page legislation allocates a total of $57.3 billion to federal agencies and programs handling energy and water infrastructure. Four Republicans ultimately joined all Democrats present in opposing the bill, resulting in a nail-biter 214-213 final vote.

“America’s prosperity begins with energy. The Fiscal Year 2026 Energy and Water Appropriations Act unleashes American energy dominance, lowers costs for families and businesses, and restores confidence in our grid,” House Appropriations Committee Chairman Tom Cole, R-Okla., said after the vote.

“Energy strength is national strength – fueling jobs, innovation, and resilience in every community – and no longer will traditional energy sources be punished for being affordable and reliable,” Cole added.

More than $25 billion is allocated for both nuclear energy and nuclear weapons development, roughly $9.9 billion for the Army Corps of Engineers, and $8.4 billion for the Office of Science. The bill also includes major investments in mining technology for critical mineral extraction, as well as zeroes out funding for the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations Department and multiple DEI-related programs.

Although the Department of Energy is given $7.7 billion for environmental management and contamination cleanup activities, the amount is less than Democrats wanted. That, as well as $687 million going to fossil fuel development and added cuts to renewable energy initiatives, led all House Democrats to oppose the bill.

Senate Democrats will likely have the same reaction, a major problem given that at least seven non-Republican votes are needed for final passage.

But here's a new twist: It's possible that you might — emphasis on the word ""might"" — not need to take delivery by Sept. 30. Just get a deal done in writing with money down to buy the qualifying EV by Sept. 30, according to a tidbit in a new Internal Revenue Service post.

Potential buyers originally were told that they must take delivery of that electric car or truck or plug-in hybrid model on or before Sept. 30 to be eligible for the lucrative tax credit.

On Aug. 21, though, the IRS indicated that a vehicle would be viewed as ""acquired"" if the buyer has ""a written, binding contract"" and made a payment on or before Sept. 30. A payment includes a nominal down payment or a vehicle trade-in.

The IRS noted that the clean vehicle credit could be claimed even if the vehicle is placed in service after Sept. 30. We're talking about a key change here.

""Taxpayers should receive a time of sale report from the dealer at the time they take possession or within three days of taking possession of the vehicle,"" the IRS stated in a newly issued ""frequently asked questions"" update.

We have tax rules, of course, and then we have what's likely to be reality.

Unfortunately, buying now and taking delivery after Sept. 30 is a tax tip that sounds straightforward. Yet, frankly, car buyers could end up frustrated if they drag their feet too far into September to do an EV deal.

Days after the IRS issued its FAQ, some auto dealers were still asking attorneys to figure out how enabling a consumer to take a late delivery could actually work without running afoul of other rules, including deadlines for state title and registration.

""It's clear cut as far as the IRS is concerned,"" said Dave Katarski, chief operating officer for Feldman Automotive Group.

""I don't necessarily know how to put the puzzle together for the consumer yet,"" Katarski told the Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network, on Aug. 28.

Late in August, he said, the objective continued to be to move metal off the lots by Sept. 30.

Theoretically, though, Car and Driver magazine notes online: ""Automakers should also be able to leverage this rule to use the tax credit as an incentive to sell as many EVs as possible before the end of September, as long as the customers are willing to wait for delivery.""

Online, Feldman Chevrolet of Novi is running a countdown clock, listing the days, hours, minutes and seconds left before the Sept. 30 deadline. ""Secure your $7,500 EV Tax Credit Before the Battery Runs Out on This Offer!""

Those who pull up to the showroom on Grand River Avenue in Novi, though, don't see a single sign plastered on the windows to fuel last-minute EV sales.

Tim Brown, EV specialist and sales consultant at Feldman Chevrolet of Novi, said customers don't need a poster to remind them that what's essentially a $7,500 government subsidy will end soon.

""I promise you, they know it,"" Brown said, adding that plenty of news outlets have been talking about the end of the tax break.

Through the end of September, many EV buyers are able to get $7,500 off the sticker price — on top of any incentives on the vehicle — on the spot if they qualify. For some, it means they'd need less money for a down payment.

Beginning in 2024, qualified buyers could opt to transfer the clean vehicle credit directly to a registered car dealer instead of waiting to claim the credit on a federal income tax return the next year.

""Everybody wants a lower price,"" said Brown, who has worked at the dealership for eight years.

Some buyers, he said, even have turned to EVs when they're dealing with negative equity on an old car loan — or owe more on the car loan than what the car they're trying to trade in is worth.

The $7,500 tax credit, plus any other rebates available, he said, has helped those who are upside down on their car loans work the numbers in their favor enough to get a new car.

Many people who bought cars during the pandemic, for example, paid shockingly high, premium prices for those vehicles and could still owe a good deal of money on their loans even after trading in the car.

""The EV has been a godsend to many people in that position,"" Brown said. ""It was the difference between them being stuck in a car or having a car that they could actually (buy) and get out of that situation and being in a better spot.""

Even older adults who might be less willing to adjust to a new technology, Brown said, reconsidered EVs once they understood how the $7,500 federal tax credit might work in their favor.

""Money will make people figure out how to charge things,"" Brown said.

Katarski agreed. He estimated that EV sales could be up 8% or 10% in August at Feldman Chevrolet, Chevy's No. 1 largest-selling EV dealer nationwide in 2024 and year to date.

According to Katarski, some who previously vowed that they would never drive an EV have found themselves saying: ""You know what I'll give it a go for a $247 a month lease payment.""

Cox Automotive noted in an Aug. 27 report that the EV market saw significant growth in July; and sales incentives on EVs were at record highs in July.

July new EV sales climbed to an estimated 130,082 units, up 26.4% month over month and 19.7% year over year, according to Cox Automotive, with 11 brands posting their best EV sales of the year in July.

""July recorded the second-highest EV sales in history, and August is expected to also see large gains,"" according to Charlie Chesbrough, senior economist at Cox Automotive.

Nothing, of course, is truly simple when it comes to car shopping, EVs and tax credits. Those tempted by all the last-minute EV buzz should take a hard look under the hood as the Sept. 30 deadline approaches.

The federal EV tax credit was set to expire at the end of 2032, but the mega-tax bill signed into law in July pushed that expiration deadline up to Sept. 30. President Donald Trump had campaigned against the EV tax credit and other rules trying to promote EV affordability and acceptance.

How to claim a clean vehicle tax credit

Taxpayers who buy qualifying EVs or plug-in hybrid models before Sept. 30 could be able to claim the tax credit on their 2025 federal income tax returns when they file next year.

But there's another option, which many buyers use now. Buyers are allowed to transfer the credit to the dealer at the time of the sale. In that case, you will not get extra tax savings from the clean vehicle credit when filing a 2025 return.

Either way, you're going to need paperwork to prove that you qualify for the credit. Save copies of the signed contract, payment receipt and dealer’s point-of-sale paperwork.

If the buyer takes the credit upfront at the time of purchase but ultimately doesn't qualify for the credit, the buyer owes the IRS. The buyer must repay the full value of the tax credit to the IRS when filing a tax return.

Why would someone not qualify? Maybe, you made too much money.

One rule of the game: You can only qualify for the clean vehicle credit when buying an EV if your modified adjusted gross income does not exceed $300,000 for married couples filing jointly; $225,000 for heads of households, and $150,000 for all other filers.

When it comes to income limits, you can use your modified AGI from the year you take delivery of the vehicle or the year before, whichever is less, according to the IRS.

The credit is nonrefundable when you file your taxes, so you can't get back more on the credit than you owe in taxes for 2025 if you do not transfer the credit to the dealer at purchase time. You can't apply any excess credit to future tax years.

Alison Flores, manager with The Tax Institute at H&R Block, noted that it's important to ask your dealer for a ""Time of Sale"" report, which documents the purchase date and other required details for claiming the EV tax credit.

EV buyers, Flores said, must work with a car dealer who is registered, or will register, for the clean vehicle credit program through the energy credits online portal by Sept. 30.

The auto dealer completes a Form 15400 ""Clean Vehicle Seller Report,"" which includes the VIN number for the electric car or truck that you bought, the Social Security number of the buyer and other information. That form is essential at tax time whether you will claim the credit on your return, or your dealer provided the tax credit on the spot, such as through down payment assistance.

The IRS automated its systems so that it could give real time verification based on the vehicle identification number.

What to know about the latest IRS twist

In August, IRS brought up the possibility of taking delivery after Sept. 30 in an FAQ. But an FAQ doesn't mean every issue has been settled. An FAQ can be modified down the road.

""Because these FAQs have not been published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin, they will not be relied on or used by the IRS to resolve a case,"" the IRS states.

""Nonetheless,"" the IRS notes, ""a taxpayer who reasonably and in good faith relies on these FAQs will not be subject to a penalty that provides a reasonable cause standard for relief, including a negligence penalty or other accuracy-related penalty, to the extent that reliance results in an underpayment of tax.""

Even so, experts say now potential EV buyers who follow other requirements likely could take delivery later than Sept. 30 — such as when a local dealer does a swap with an out-of-town dealer to get you the exact EV that you'd like to buy — and still qualify for the credit.

""Once you take possession of the qualifying EV, you can take the credit,"" said Flores, at H&R Block. ""Possession of the vehicle is still necessary to claim the credit.""

Everyone doesn't get $7,500

The credits can be up to $7,500 for eligible new EVs and up to $4,000 for eligible used electric vehicles.

For vehicles placed in service April 18, 2023, and after, you'd receive up to $3,750 if the vehicle meets the critical minerals requirement only. An eligible clean vehicle can't contain any critical minerals that were sourced by a ""foreign entity of concern,"" such as China.

Or you'd receive up to $3,750 if the vehicle meets the battery components requirement only. Or you'd receive up to $7,500 if the new qualifying EV meets both.

Some EV buyers can tap into a deduction for car loans

In some cases, EV buyers could get two tax breaks.

Some buyers might be able to claim the clean vehicle tax credit and a deduction on car loan interest when they file their 2025 income tax returns in 2026. Review all the rules. The income limits vary for the different tax breaks, for example, so not everyone will qualify.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law by Trump on July 4, introduces a deduction of up to $10,000 a year for car loan interest on loans originated after Dec. 31, 2024.

The new car or truck that you bought with the auto loan must have had its final assembly in the United States. The purchase of a new car — used cars don't qualify — must take place in 2025 or after.

The income limit for the deduction for car loan interest is much lower than the limit for the clean vehicle credit.

The deduction for car loan interest, on the other hand, starts phasing out at a much lower income level. It phases out by $200 for every $1,000 of modified adjusted gross income above $100,000 for single filers and $200,000 for joint filers.

The new car loan deduction only applies in 2025, 2026, 2027 and 2028.

Both itemizers and nonitemizers can claim the car loan interest deduction. The same's true with the clean vehicle tax credit.

Every EV sold doesn't qualify for an EV tax credit

When you're buying an EV, the make and model and the MSRP matter. Make sure the vehicle meets the price caps to qualify for the credit. The manufacturer's suggested retail price, or MSRP, according to the IRS, may not exceed $80,000 for vans, SUVs and pickup trucks, and $55,000 for other vehicles.

The credits do not apply to every package offered on some electric car or truck or plug-in hybrid models.

Check out the details at FuelEconomy.gov to search for eligible vehicles. Independent websites, such as Edmunds, also list eligible vehicles.

Many opt to lease EVs to save money

A loophole in the tax credit, which was part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, gave dealers a unique ability to promote highly attractive leases for new EVs and plug-in hybrids. You'd need to lease before Sept. 30 to benefit.

Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive, told the Detroit Free Press that only about 20 electric and plug-in hybrid models are eligible for the clean vehicle credit of up to $7,500 for consumers.

Thanks to the EV leasing loophole, though, she said, virtually any EV can qualify for what's known as a commercial clean vehicle tax credit. And the driver's income isn't taken into account with leasing.

""If you don’t meet income or sourcing requirements, leasing can still unlock the full credit,"" Valdez Streaty said.

If you lease, you cannot claim the tax credit when you file your 2025 federal income tax return for added savings.

Jessica Caldwell, head of insights for Edmunds, said automakers are promoting leases now to move EV inventory by the Sept. 30 deadline and win over first-time EV drivers who could keep coming back as EV adoption grows.

According to Edmunds data, leases made up 70% of EV transactions in July, compared with 10% for the same month three years ago before the loophole went into place.

The savings involved with leasing potentially could amount to about $208 a month, according to Edmunds.com, if you spread a $7,500 tax credit across a 36-month lease.

Lease deals can be highly regional and vary. Some lease deals will require a bigger down payment so that you can have lower monthly payments.

I spotted a 24-month lease deal in metro Detroit at $249 a month for a 2025 Chevrolet Equinox EV with $3,049 due at signing, according to Edmunds.com data. That deal ran through Sept. 2 in several states, as of late August.

Capital Hyundai of San Jose, California, had some 36-month, low-mileage lease deals at $99 to $199 a month on clean vehicles in late August with $4,998 in cash due at signing.

Valdez Streaty suggests that last-minute shoppers compare offers across dealer websites and EV marketplaces. Check for state or local EV incentives and utility rebates. Look for manufacturer promotions that can stack on top of the clean vehicle credit.

Be flexible in September. ""Inventory is tightening, so consider multiple models or trims,"" Valdez Streaty said.

(NYSE: F) said it would completely change the way it makes electric vehicles (EVs), it reported its August and year-to-date unit sales. EV sales dropped almost 6% to less than 4% of total unit sales. For the first eight months of the year, EV sales totaled 57,888, against a company total of 1,492,905. It is an astonishingly low EV figure for a company that has invested tens of billions of dollars into the sector and once said it would have an EV annual production run rate well into the hundreds of thousands of units.

Ford has just introduced what it called its “Universal EV Platform.” The day of the announcement, its stock fell on less than normal volume. The new plan is to get an MSRP of less than $30,000 for a single model—a mid-sized electric pickup. The investment for this advancement in manufacturing will be $5 billion, just to get one new model out the door. Ford expects there to be others.

Ford’s EV failure can be illustrated by its two flagship EV models. Its F-150 Lightning carries the name of the bestselling vehicle in America. The Mustang Mach-E is an EV crossover. For some reason, it is named after Ford’s iconic sports car, the Mustang, which was first sold in 1964.

Ford’s Future

The reality of Ford’s present and future is that it is a fossil-fuel car company in a fossil-fuel vehicle world. While it will lose about $5 billion in its EV efforts this year, its gasoline-powered vehicles are very profitable. Ford is reaching toward an EV future that may never arrive.

Over the past five years, its stock is up 69%, compared to the S&P 500’s 90% gain. However, at just under $12, it is down from $24, where it traded in early 2022. At that point, Ford had made a case to the market that its huge EV investment would make it competitive with market leader Tesla. According to CarEdge, in the first quarter of this year, Tesla had a U.S. EV market share of 44%. GM’s was 11%. At just below 8%, Ford was tied with Hyundai/Kia. Ford’s market share is below what it was in the second half of 2022.

Ford is a gasoline-powered car company.

Government data show biodiesel imports averaged just 2,000 barrels per day (b/d) between January and June, compared with 35,000 b/d in the same period a year earlier. Imports of renewable diesel also fell dramatically, averaging 5,000 b/d compared with 33,000 b/d in the first half of 2024.

The collapse follows the expiration of the $1-per-gallon blender’s tax credit, which for years had supported both U.S. and foreign supplies. Since January, the Inflation Reduction Act’s Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit has only applied to domestically produced fuels, leaving imports at a disadvantage.

The downturn was compounded by weaker domestic demand. U.S. consumption of renewable diesel dropped by around 30% in early 2025 compared with a year earlier, while biodiesel use fell by 40%. Analysts attribute the declines to poor blending margins and regulatory uncertainty. With limited volumes being used, blenders turned to U.S.-produced fuels, while imports shrank. Neste, the world’s largest renewable diesel producer and the only supplier of such imports to the U.S., reported diverting a smaller share of its output to the American market this year.

Consumption of biodiesel and renewable diesel is projected to recover later in 2025 as refiners seek to comply with Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) obligations.

Alex Mardirossian, a Los Angeles personal injury attorney who also handles lemon law cases at his firm AM Legal, is among them. He bought his first EV with the help of the federal rebate and is now looking to upgrade to a larger model before the credit sunsets.

“Looking at Lucid, the Gravity. I have two kids, so something that’s a little bit bigger than my Tesla right now,” Mardirossian said. “It definitely was a factor. Helped out for sure.”

The federal EV tax credit — worth up to $7,500 — was first established in 2008 and then overhauled in former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act.

A new law, signed by President Trump, set the program to expire on Sept. 30.

The change comes at a pivotal moment for California, which leads the nation in EV adoption and has pledged to end the sale of new gasoline-powered cars by 2035. Losing the incentive could make reaching that target more difficult.

Adding to the challenge, California EV drivers are also about to lose another perk: carpool lane access.

The DMV said Clean Air Vehicle decals, which allowed solo EV drivers to use high-occupancy lanes, will no longer be valid starting Oct. 1.

Republican leaders opposed extending the federal credit, calling EV subsidies a handout for wealthy buyers and an unfair burden on taxpayers.

But advocates argue the opposite — that ending the incentive will put EVs further out of reach for the very consumers who could benefit most from long-term fuel and maintenance savings.

“This means that people who may not have a lot of expendable income… those folks are going to be less likely to be able to access an electric vehicle,” said Ingrid Malmgren, policy director at Plug In America. “People with a lot of disposable income, it’s not really going to change. They’ll still get whatever car they want.”

Malmgren predicts a spike in EV sales before the deadline, followed by a drop-off. Still, she believes the long-term trend will continue upward.

Mardirossian agrees that incentives help, but that his decision is also about lifestyle and values.

""I like the vehicles in general,"" he said. ""And given my lifestyle, and just commuting locally for the most part, it makes sense for me.""",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/2023-01-09-ev-la_01092023,N,,2025-09-05 11:03:54.326883

During debate on Sept. 3 on the Energy and Water Appropriations bill, the House approved by voice vote an amendment by Rep. Doug LaMalfa (R-CA) that would increase the Army Corps of Engineers Construction account by $2 million to support Issue Evaluation Studies, including at Black Butte Dam, which is part of the Central Valley Project. It was part of a larger block of amendments approved en bloc.

For the most part, though, no major changes were made to the underlying bill. A Congressional Research Service summary of the bill, including a comparison to past spending levels and details related funding the Trump administration has canceled, is available here.

In a report accompanying the bill, the Appropriations Committee directs the Department of Energy to work with industry to survey electric transmission and distribution system operators for data on new generator interconnection applications and to provide a report to the committee by next year.

Also, in report language the committee wrote ""The Committee recognizes the dramatic load growth on the electric grid over the next decade, in part due to the commercial computation sector. As such, the EIA is encouraged to collect data on aggregate state-level, monthly computation sector electricity demand. The EIA is encouraged to publish this data alongside its other data on electricity consumption by customer segment (residential, commercial, industrial) monthly, at state-level granularity.""

The committee also noted the unique challenges facing the distribution transformer supply chain and that a stable supply of distribution transformers is critical to preserving the reliability of the grid.

Just six days after President Lula signed the new licensing law, legislators and senators opposed to the executive’s vetoes filed 833 amendments to the MP, which originally covers only the LAE and consists of just six articles. The LAE, championed at the time by Mr. Alcolumbre, a government ally, is a new type of permit designed to speed up approvals for projects deemed strategic.

Lawmakers are using this as one of their tactics while Mr. Alcolumbre delays calling a joint congressional session to analyze the vetoes — expected in about two weeks, though no date has been set. Overturning Lula’s vetoes is the main goal of these lawmakers, most aligned with the powerful agribusiness caucus, which has been pressing Mr. Alcolumbre to schedule the session.

Congressman Pedro Lupion, head of the Congressional Agricultural Front (FPA), said the government shows no interest in advancing the MP. For now, there is not even a rapporteur or chair for the joint committee, which has yet to be formed. The MP must be voted on within four months, or it will expire.

“We are mobilized to overturn the vetoes. But before that, we submitted amendments to get as close as possible to the bill we approved,” Mr. Lupion told Valor, noting that he alone filed 19 amendments. “We want to force either a vote on the vetoes or on the MP. Something has to happen. The amendments reflect the text of the licensing bill. We are waiting on President Davi [Alcolumbre].”

Congressman Zé Vitor, also from the agribusiness bloc and rapporteur of the licensing bill in the House, noted that the proposed amendments to the MP contain “minor text adjustments that the internal rules previously did not allow.”

Broadly, the hundreds of amendments seek to reinsert into the general licensing law provisions that President Lula vetoed, such as: the Environmental License by Adhesion and Commitment (LAC) for medium-impact projects; exemption from licensing for rural producers whose Rural Environmental Registry (CAR) is still under review; and the removal of requirements to consult intervening agencies—such as the National Foundation for Indigenous Peoples (FUNAI)—in licensing processes affecting non-demarcated areas.

Randolfe Rodrigues, the government’s leader in Congress, said that proposing amendments is a legitimate part of the legislative process but warned that the executive would veto again if lawmakers tried to reinstate sections President Lula had struck down.

He admitted, however, that the government faces difficulty securing enough votes to block an override. The administration has not ruled out challenging the issue in court but is instead seeking a political agreement.",https://s2-valorinternational.glbimg.com/omGcz_OOzszdI28WbRObFcwlPLM=/1200x/smart/filters:cover():strip_icc()/i.s3.glbimg.com/v1/AUTH_63b422c2caee4269b8b34177e8876b93/internal_photos/bs/2025/0/U/oyV6bwRNaHunXZADVXIw/foto05pol-101-licencia-a16.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 12:09:44.640926

The U.S. Energy Department is scrutinizing clean energy programs and initiatives launched under the Biden administration, including the Northwest hub.
The Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub said in its emailed statement that “project adjustments were expected and planned for” in the early development phase of the nascent industry.
The Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub game plan envisions that producers will make “green” hydrogen exclusively by splitting water molecules with an electric current.
Clean hydrogen producers strive to qualify for the tax credit in order to lower the otherwise high retail price of the fuel.","A billion-dollar, taxpayer-funded enterprise to kickstart a clean hydrogen industry in the Pacific Northwest took another hit due to energy companies getting cold feet.

Portland General Electric and its partner Mitsubishi Power have quietly shelved a planned hydrogen production, storage and hydrogen-fueled generation complex near Boardman, Oregon.

“Given the exit of an essential project partner in June, along with challenging project economics for utility customers and federal policy changes, PGE is no longer pursuing” the hydrogen complex, PGE spokesman Drew Hanson said via email.

The cancellation comes at a dicey time for the tri-state Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub, the ringleader that is channeling federal money to projects in the region. The U.S. Energy Department is scrutinizing clean energy programs and initiatives launched under the Biden administration, including the Northwest hub. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said he is ready to terminate funding for projects that he deems “a bridge to nowhere.”

Elected officials from across the political spectrum in the Northwest have defended low-emissions hydrogen as a promising means to create new jobs and meet climate goals, particularly in sectors that are proving difficult to convert directly to clean electric power.

“We have several new projects in the pipeline that we’re excited to share more on soon,” spokesperson Kaitlin Sheppard said in an emailed statement on behalf of the Northwest hydrogen hub. “PNWH2 continues to evaluate additional project interest and remains focused on supporting a broad, resilient regional hydrogen ecosystem with the potential to deliver lasting economic value to Oregon and the greater Pacific Northwest.”

The PGE and Mitsubishi Power pullback follows in the wake of the scrapping of a different hydrogen factory in Centralia, Washington, proposed by Fortescue, which was to be one of the primary producers of the alternative fuel within the regional clean energy hub. Another founding partner in the PNWH2 Hub, Seattle-based developer of hydrogen-powered mining trucks First Mode, declared bankruptcy last December.

PGE’s pivot calls into question what will happen at the nearby Port of Morrow, where Air Liquide planned to build a hydrogen liquefaction plant to support distribution of clean hydrogen to urban fueling stations and the ports of Seattle and Tacoma. PGE and Mitsubishi were supposed to supply the gaseous hydrogen to Air Liquide via a short pipeline from the site of PGE’s demolished coal power plant outside Boardman.

Air Liquide acknowledged a request for comment, but a spokesperson declined to shed more light about where things are headed now.

The Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub said in its emailed statement that “project adjustments were expected and planned for” in the early development phase of the nascent industry. The pullback in this region tracks with what is happening elsewhere.

Brand name corporations — such as Shell, BP and Airbus — and lesser-known startups around the world are scaling back their hydrogen ambitions. Commonly cited reasons include a slower-than-anticipated emergence of customer demand and stubbornly high costs to produce green hydrogen.

The developers behind the two remaining large-scale projects in the Northwest hydrogen hub are pressing ahead. Switzerland-based Atlas Agro plans to build a $1.5 billion green fertilizer factory near Richland, Washington, for which hydrogen produced on site will be a key ingredient. Meanwhile, Calgary-based AltaGas has a costly plan to redevelop the closed Alcoa aluminum smelter near Ferndale, Washington, to produce climate-friendly hydrogen for refinery use, transportation fuel and possibly power generation.

Crucially, Atlas Agro and AltaGas need to secure large volumes of affordable renewable electricity for the energy-intensive process of making hydrogen. The green fertilizer plant reportedly needs around 300 megawatts of power, which is a bigger load than all of the rest of Richland combined.

AltaGas estimated last year that it needs about 265 megawatts of electricity to achieve its maximum production target at Ferndale. Neither company has confirmed they have a power supply contract amid rising competition for sources of renewable electricity.

“The success of this project is contingent on regulatory and financial incentive certainty, timely approvals, and a clear and predictable path forward from government and commercial partners,” said Andrea McNamara Doyle, Washington state external affairs manager for AltaGas, in an emailed statement.

The Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub game plan envisions that producers will make “green” hydrogen exclusively by splitting water molecules with an electric current. This process (known as electrolysis) must use renewable electricity for the resulting hydrogen to be considered green.

Hydrogen sector dependent on uncertain government support

A year ago, the Pacific NW hub collected the first installment from its potentially $1 billion federal allocation. That $27.5 million in initial funding through the Energy Department partially passed through to participating companies and to Washington State University to begin site planning and community outreach.

Under the original program terms, another tranche of funding would come 12-18 months after the first to subsidize developer permitting and engineering. A third tranche could underwrite the construction phase for multiple years, before a possible final shot of money comes to subsidize production ramp up. In all, the hub could pass through federal subsidies to its participants for 8-12 years.

But this past May, Wright, President Donald Trump’s energy secretary, announced a department-wide review of grant programs to root out “wasteful spending of taxpayer dollars.” Wright expressed skepticism about government support to scale up clean hydrogen.

“Hydrogen, it’s tough with the math to see how in the long term it becomes a meaningful commercial energy source,” Wright told senators at a budget hearing in front of the Senate Energy Committee in June, during which Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Washington, pressed him to state his position on the hydrogen hubs.

“It’s expensive to produce, but there are high value uses,” Wright went on to say about hydrogen. He predicted the agency will continue funding some projects under review, modify others and terminate the “low-value” ones.

Cantwell responded that the Northwest’s renewable hydropower made her region a good place to make hydrogen for hard-to-decarbonize sectors.

A spokesperson at Energy Department headquarters confirmed this past week that the program vetting was ongoing, but declined to estimate when the results will become known.

Democrats in the U.S. Senate preemptively wrote a joint letter to Wright in April asserting it would be illegal for the Trump administration to unilaterally cancel Congressionally-approved spending on clean energy projects. Oregon’s Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley and Washington’s Patty Murray and Cantwell signed on.

“Our Constitution gives Congress the power of the purse and exclusive power to appropriate funds,” the 27 senators wrote. “In this instance, where Congress has authorized and appropriated funds for programs that support clean energy projects, the Department must faithfully execute the law and expend the funds for the purposes provided.”

If the PNWH2 Hub survives the Energy Department vetting, the pressure will still be on. Earlier this year, the Republican-controlled Congress shortened the window for companies to get lucrative tax incentives that were created in the 2022 Biden climate and clean energy package.

Private developers now have until the end of 2027 to begin construction on a hydrogen plant in order to qualify for production tax credits. The deadline was previously 2033. Clean hydrogen producers strive to qualify for the tax credit in order to lower the otherwise high retail price of the fuel.

“Under current federal and state permitting regimes, this accelerated timeline may jeopardize our eligibility for the tax credit, which is essential for achieving positive project returns, and we are evaluating our ability to meet the new timelines,” said Doyle from AltaGas.

“In the last couple of years, different items that have gone up in price have become media concerns. They become very visible, people get very angry — and I think electric rates are heading in that direction,” said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors’ Association.

Wolfe said that if rates continue to rise, “it’ll become a political issue.”

The Trump administration is already seeing it as one — and trying to put the blame on Democrats and renewable energy.

“That is a key challenge for us,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright told Fox Business Network’s “Mornings with Maria” when asked about utility bills this week.

“Things move slowly in the electricity grid. All sorts of crazy projects were under construction and being built on your electricity grids over the last four years,” he said.

Wright, in a recent interview with Politico, similarly blamed “the momentum of the Obama-Biden policies.”

However, he lamented, “We’re going to get blamed, because we’re in office.”

President Trump has taken a similar tack, blaming renewables even though a greater supply of renewable power would actually be expected to bring costs down.

On Truth Social this week, he decried “ridiculous, corrupt politician approved ‘’windmills.’”

He also previously posted, “Any State that has built and relied on WINDMILLS and SOLAR for power are seeing RECORD BREAKING INCREASES IN ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY COSTS. THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!”

While on the campaign trail, Trump promised to bring down electricity prices.

“Under my leadership, the United States will commit to the ambitious goal of slashing energy and electricity prices by half, at least,” he said at a rally last year. “We intend to slash prices by half within 12 months, at a maximum 18 months.”

Democrats are beginning to weaponize the issue against Republicans, especially after they repealed subsidies for wind and solar energy.

“The big, ugly bill is going to mean a lot of big, ugly energy bills arriving in the mail for Americans around the country,” Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) said last month.

Experts say a buildout of renewables would help bring down prices, but the impacts of Trump’s moves are not being felt yet.

“Residential retail electricity prices are set with basically a lag,” Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Christopher Knittel recently told The Hill. “Trump’s effects on the rate changes won’t take place until after the midterms.”

But they also note some of this administration’s policies, including those that attack renewable energy, are expected to exacerbate the issue in the future.

“It’s less power capacity being built, and then that means that there’s gonna be less supply of power and the same demand, so prices will be higher,” Thomas Rowlands-Rees, head of North America Research at BloombergNEF, said when asked about the repeal of renewable energy tax credits.

However, Knittel said blue-state policies that require a transition to renewable energy may also be contributing to the problem.

“Renewable policies in some of the blue states have put upward pressure on prices,” he said.

“Renewable portfolio standards that have forced or incentivized or regulated adoption of more renewables, partly with the idea that the Inflation Reduction Act would provide some financial support for that, and now that’s gone, or will be gone — that’s going to put upward pressure on prices,” Knittel said, noting the combination of the Democrat standards and Republican subsidy repeal are both contributing to this issue.

Meanwhile, Rowlands-Rees noted the Trump administration’s push to export more liquified natural gas (LNG) may also raise consumer electric prices.

“If the U.S. is increasing its ability to export that gas as LNG, where the exporters will make a much bigger profit than selling it locally in the U.S., then a lot of that gas will then go abroad, and so the more capability the U.S. has to export its gas, the higher gas prices will be in the U.S., for U.S. citizens,” he said.

“There’s such a huge contrast between the global price of gas and the domestic U.S. price of gas … and the only reason the two aren’t the same is because of this limited ability to export,” he added. “The U.S. is in this little bubble of cheap gas, and so the more that bubble is burst by pro-LNG export policies, the more … U.S. gas prices start to look like the rest of the world.”

U.S. electricity primarily comes from gas, coal, renewable and nuclear energy.

Another major driver of price increases is the buildout of data centers, as AI and other technologies are particularly power-hungry. If these centers don’t come with their own power source, they may just use whatever’s on the grid, driving up demand.

“There is this upward pressure because of data centers,” Rowlands-Rees said.

Both Democrats and Republicans have been at least somewhat supportive of boosting construction of data centers, though the Trump administration has particularly put forward plans to fast track them.

But Knittel said that’s just one factor contributing to the higher prices seen today.

“You also have climate change that is increasing wildfire risks,” he said. “That’s putting upward pressure on prices … on the West Coast.”

Meanwhile, Wolfe, with the National Energy Assistance Directors’ Association, also expressed concerns about the Trump administration’s efforts to slash a financial assistance program that helps low-income Americans afford to heat and cool their homes.

While this program has historically had bipartisan support and is likely to get money from Congress, the Trump administration has proposed defunding it.

“Even if Congress goes ahead and gives … funding, [it] doesn’t mean they’re going to spend it,” Wolfe said. “If you don’t have access to appropriate cooling and heating, you can die.”",https://www.ketk.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/34/2025/09/trump_donald_02142025_GettyImages-2198926783.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-05 19:06:05.576946

(CNN) — America’s aging power grid has faced strain for years, exacerbated by severe weather events, an explosion of data centers and the demand created by artificial intelligence.

Now, electricity is emerging as a top issue on the campaign trail.

Campaigns in this fall’s races for New Jersey and Virginia governors, as well as candidates in the upcoming midterms, are taking note of surging utility bills, in the latest sign that affordability has become central to campaigns at all levels.

In her first general election campaign ad, US Rep. Mikie Sherrill, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee in New Jersey, declares that on “Day One as governor, I’m declaring a state of emergency on utility costs, using emergency powers to end these rate hikes and drive down your bills.”

Jack Ciattarelli, Sherrill’s GOP opponent, unveiled his own first-day plan calling for more energy generation.

“We need to expand our nuclear capabilities in South Jersey, we need to accelerate solar, we can’t rely on wind,” Ciattarelli said on Fox News recently, laying blame with the outgoing Democratic administration of Gov. Phil Murphy.

Three leading Democratic organizations spent $8 million on an August ad campaign that linked rising electricity bills to GOP policymaking, arguing that the “One Big, Beautiful Bill” passed this summer “removes clean energy from the electric grid, creating a massive rate hike on electricity.”

Americans for Prosperity, a leading conservative group, launched a seven-figure ad campaign urging lawmakers “to unleash America’s energy potential by cutting red tape and eliminating counterproductive regulations.”

Energy Secretary Chris Wright has acknowledged the looming challenge both for power generation and for Republicans politically.

“It’s what I worry about most seven days a week,” he told Fox Business. “We want to stop the rise in electricity for Americans.”

Speaking to Politico, Wright was even more frank.

“Who’s going to get blamed for it? We’re going to get blamed because we’re in office.”

The Department of Energy, meanwhile, blamed the Biden administration’s policies for driving up electricity prices, and pointed to its efforts to “meet this rising power demand, fueled in part by the buildout of AI and data centers.”

“With President Trump’s leadership, the Department of Energy is reversing course: Ending subsidies that supported more expensive, less reliable energy, reversing policies that forced the premature closure of baseload power sources and expanding access to affordable, reliable, secure energy 24/7,” said Emery Washington, a spokesperson for the department.

“DOE is pursuing a strategy of energy addition—reforming costly permitting processes, keeping base load power online, and building more energy infrastructure needed to keep the lights and energy prices low for the American people.”

The power problem

The cost of power has set a record for two consecutive years in the country’s largest grid, covering a wide swath of competitive political territory that includes parts of Pennsylvania, Michigan, North Carolina, Virginia and New Jersey.

According to a May report from the US Energy Information Administration, “retail electricity prices have increased faster than the rate of inflation since 2022, and we expect them to continue increasing through 2026.”

The EIA separately noted this summer that “residential electricity prices in the Pacific, Middle Atlantic, and New England census divisions—regions where consumers already pay much more per kilowatt hour for electricity—could increase more than the national average.”

A big reason why is data centers. Campuses are springing up across the country, powering artificial intelligence technology and offering sought-after economic development. Their energy needs are enormous, however, with some data centers drawing as much power as 800,000 homes.

In Virginia – dubbed by one state industry group as the “data center capital of the world” – data centers consumed nearly a quarter of the electricity generated in the state in 2023, according to the Electric Power Research Institute, an independent nonprofit.

A report from the Department of Energy last year, meanwhile, estimated that data center energy use “is projected to double or triple by 2028.”

Spiking demand is driving bills up for individuals. In New Jersey, residential rates have climbed by up to 20%, and the tri-state Regional Plan Association found that “increased demand from data centers is attributed to about two-thirds of the increased prices.”

It’s also putting tremendous pressure on power grids that are already strained. According to another Energy Department report, “our aging infrastructure is struggling to meet our modern electricity needs,” and “70 percent of transmission lines are over 25 years old.” Studies from Pennsylvania State University and Columbia University have also linked grid vulnerabilities to increasing severe weather events.

According to an analysis from Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan think tank, power generation capacity could fall by 340 gigawatts by 2035, with one gigawatt being enough to power up to 1 million homes, while household energy costs could increase $170 annually due to the lost subsidies resulting from the “One, Big Beautiful Bill” passed over the summer.

The campaigns respond

Democrats argue that surging demand validates their support for alternative energy sources, pointing to President Donald Trump and Republicans slashing clean energy tax credits and canceling work on a nearly complete wind farm in Rhode Island. Republicans say it’s all the more reason to deregulate and ramp up fossil-fuel production.

Sherrill is positioning herself in the debate. “New Jersey isn’t generating even close to enough in-state power to keep costs low, and we risk missing the clean energy targets that we need to protect our environment for generations to come. I’m not going to accept that,” she wrote in her “Day One Declaration” plan.

Ciattarelli also called out high electricity costs in his first general election campaign ad, pushing back on his rival’s critiques. “All Mikie Sherrill wants to talk about is President Trump. Come on, what does the president have to do with rising property taxes and higher electricity bills?” he says. “I’ll lower electricity bills.”

Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic nominee for governor in Virginia, unveiled a suite of policy proposals aimed at lowering energy costs, including a focus on local generation, weatherization, and regulatory reform. Notably, Spanberger’s plan referenced “making sure data centers don’t drive up energy costs for everyone else in Virginia.”

Additionally, Spanberger and a few others have made the connection between AI data centers and spiking electricity bills. It opens a fraught debate about the rising cost of electricity to operate a technology, artificial intelligence, that could threaten some voters’ jobs.

And the Virginia League of Conservation Voters, a branch of the leading environmental group, is up with an ad blaming Republicans for higher bills, saying “big energy is raising prices” and arguing that “Virginia Republicans are helping big corporations rip you off.”",https://kvia.b-cdn.net/2019/10/kvia-favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-05 10:00:50.820143

California is once again at the center of the nation’s automotive and energy policy debate. With federal electric vehicle (EV) tax credits set to expire this September, the state is considering whether to create its own replacement program. This would not only affect car buyers but could also reshape the national conversation on emissions rules, vehicle affordability, and the balance of power between state and federal regulators.

The California Air Resources Board (CARB) released a report on August 19 recommending that the state consider “backfilling” the federal credits with its own point-of-sale rebates, vouchers, or other incentives to keep EV sales moving. The details remain vague, but the intention is clear: California wants to keep its aggressive zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) goals on track, even as Washington scales back related programs.

But California has been here before. This is not the first time the state has clashed with the federal government over vehicle regulations - and it likely won’t be the last.

California has a unique history when it comes to vehicle emissions. Decades before the federal government created the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), California was already regulating air quality in response to its smog problem. When the Clean Air Act was passed in 1970, California was granted a waiver that allowed it to set its own, stricter emissions standards. Other states were given the option to adopt California’s rules, and some states have done so. Today, eleven states follows California’s lead. This waiver authority has made California an outsized force in shaping vehicle propulsion. Automakers cannot ignore a market of this size, which means California’s rules often become de facto national standards.

Clashes with Washington

California’s regulatory independence has not always sat well with Washington. Under different administrations, the federal government has either supported or resisted the state’s authority. During the Obama years, California partnered with the federal government to create a unified fuel economy and emissions program, giving automakers a single set of national rules. Under the Trump administration, the EPA rolled back certain emissions standards, sparking legal battles with California, which insisted on enforcing its own tougher rules. The state formed alliances with other states and even some automakers to defend its position. Today, with federal EV tax credits expiring at the end of September and policy focus shifting, California is again stepping into the driver’s seat by proposing its own financial incentives. These ongoing disputes highlight a deeper question: should environmental and automotive policy be driven by national uniformity, or by one state acting as the policy leader?

California’s ZEV Mandate

The discussion over tax credits cannot be separated from California’s ZEV mandate. Under CARB’s plan, automakers must steadily increase the percentage of EVs they sell, with the ultimate goal of phasing out new gasoline-powered vehicle sales by 2035. This is one of the most ambitious policies in the country, and automakers are scrambling to meet the targets. Some states, such as New York and Massachusetts, have pledged to follow California’s lead, while others remain skeptical. For consumers, this means that vehicle availability will increasingly be shaped by government mandates and not by market demand. Even if gas-powered cars remain popular, automakers will need to balance that demand with regulatory compliance.

California’s New Incentives

The CARB report suggests that any new program would differ from the federal credits in key ways. Instead of tax credits, buyers could receive point-of-sale rebates, allowing them to benefit immediately rather than waiting until tax season. Incentives may vary depending on income level, vehicle type, or price, so luxury EVs could receive lower rebates while affordable models get more support. Additionally, any new program would be tied to yearly funding availability, meaning that if budgets tighten, rebates could shrink or disappear. This approach could make the system more flexible, but it also introduces uncertainty for buyers trying to plan their purchases. In the past the state of California and other states have run out of money in the EV fund and left buyers with nothing.

For California residents, the promise of continued incentives is welcome news, but the reality is more complicated. EVs still come with challenges beyond sticker price. Even with rebates, EVs are often thousands of dollars more expensive than comparable gasoline cars. California has built more chargers than any other state, yet many regions remain underserved, and home charging is not always an option, particularly for renters. EVs also tend to depreciate faster than gas vehicles due to rapid advances in technology and concerns about battery life. Insurance rates are higher on electric vehicles as well. A large expense is electricity rates which are going up across the country. Without a state-supported used EV credit, buyers in this segment may face steeper hurdles. Incentives may help address some of these issues in the short term, but they do not solve the bigger structural challenges of EV adoption.

One of the key criticisms of EV subsidies is that they often benefit wealthier households. Data from federal programs has shown that a large percentage of credits went to buyers in higher income brackets because these households are more likely to purchase new cars, and EVs remain disproportionately concentrated in the premium market segment. California may attempt to address this with scaled incentives, but questions remain about whether the system can truly deliver benefits to everyone. Meanwhile, working-class families who rely on affordable used cars may find themselves subsidizing programs that they cannot realistically take advantage of.

Automakers and the Industry Impact

For automakers, California’s decisions carry immense weight. The state accounts for nearly 12% of U.S. auto sales, and when you include the other states that follow its rules, the market share becomes impossible to ignore. Manufacturers that fail to meet California’s requirements face penalties, while those that comply can earn credits to sell or trade. This system has created an uneven playing field, favoring companies with strong EV lineups. Tesla, for instance, has profited significantly from selling ZEV credits to competitors in the past. If California establishes a robust new rebate system, it could further tilt the market toward EVs, encouraging automakers to prioritize them even more, take greater loses on each vehicle.

At its core, this debate is about whether government policy should drive technology adoption or whether the market should dictate the pace. California argues that aggressive incentives and mandates are necessary to address climate goals and push the auto industry forward. Critics counter that these policies distort the market, forcing automakers and taxpayers to shoulder costs that may not align with consumer demand. They also warn of unintended consequences, such as reduced affordability, lack of charging stations, and strained electrical infrastructure.

California’s proposal to replace expiring federal EV tax credits with state-funded incentives is the latest chapter in a decades-long story of the state asserting its role as the nation’s automotive regulator. With its ZEV mandate and aggressive environmental policies, California is pushing automakers, consumers, and policymakers to adapt - whether they’re ready or not. For some wealthier car buyers, this could mean continued financial support when purchasing an EV, but it also raises questions about long-term effectiveness. For taxpayers, it means another debate about where funds should be directed and increased taxes for residents. For the auto industry, it underscores more loses on vehicles that are designed by one states demands.

As history shows, when California moves, the rest of the country often feels the impact. The next few months will reveal whether the state can successfully design a program that keeps EV sales going without overburdening its citizens with more increased taxes. But one thing is certain: decisions made by California will burden at least 11 other states and this is a real issue to watch.

ATLANTA, GA - Qcells, an industry-leading solar manufacturer and provider of complete clean energy solutions, today announced it is now the first and only polysilicon-based solar manufacturer to achieve Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT)'s Low Carbon Solar standard. Qcells obtained EPEAT status last year, but, after years of work, hit its stringent low-carbon threshold, which awarded Qcells with this exciting distinction. EPEAT is a globally recognized, premier ecolabel for electronics and other technologies that validates sustainable production practices, making it easier for customers to select low-carbon, environmentally friendly solutions.

In a massive step forward for sustainability in the solar industry, Qcells has achieved Low Carbon status for two products, including a residential solar panel and a community, commercial and industrial (CCI) panel, both assembled at its Dalton, Georgia manufacturing facility. This comes after Qcells achieved initial EPEAT registration on these two panels in June 2024. This means that:

• Qcells' EPEAT registered modules have a ~73% lower carbon footprint [or lower carbon intensity] than imported solar products from China.

• In comparison to an average utility-scale 100 MW solar PV project, a same-size PV project with Qcells' EPEAT registered panels would have 37% lower emissions for the same power output. This means Qcells' EPEAT registered solar panels are 37% more sustainable than a global standard solar panel.

""At Qcells, we want our solar products to be the most sustainably built products on the market,"" said Kelly Weger, Senior Director of Sustainability at Qcells. ""After more than two years of collecting extensive data, we're excited to see our products meet EPEAT's rigorous standards. We remain fully committed to manufacturing complete clean energy solutions and building a sustainable future.""

As only 30% of solar products are expected to be able to meet the minimum criteria to achieve the EPEAT ecolabel, Qcells leads the way as the first domestic manufacturer to provide EPEAT-registered residential solar panels. Qcells is proud to be a domestic manufacturer of solar panels in the U.S. and plans to continue expanding its number of products on the EPEAT registry manufactured at its Dalton and Cartersville, Georgia manufacturing facilities.

EPEAT registration is a thorough process that measures social and environmental impacts of products from extraction to end of life. The lifecycle-based criteria are adjusted as sustainability standards evolve. EPEAT registered products, including Qcells', are listed on the Global Electronic Council's EPEAT registry, where customers with ambitious sustainability goals can easily find Qcells' solar products. Ultimately, EPEAT's online registry helps to drive supply chain improvements by simplifying the procurement of sustainably manufactured low-carbon solar panels.

Very early in the plan, Tesla would have to reach a market valuation of $2 trillion and achieve 20 million vehicles deliveries.
The goals set out for Musk and Tesla are extremely ambitious given recent tumult at the Texas company.
Meanwhile sales of Chinese rival BYD continued to climb fast, grabbing 1.1% market share of all car sales in the month versus Tesla's 0.7%.
Tesla's stock rose nearly 2% in premarket trading.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk could be in line for a payout of $1 trillion if his electric car company meets a series of extremely aggressive targets over the next 10 years, according to documents released by the company.

Tesla, which is leaning heavily into robotics and AI, said in a regulatory filing on Friday that the package has a dozen share tranches that include awards for Musk if targets, ranging from car production to the total value of the company, are met over that time period.

Very early in the plan, Tesla would have to reach a market valuation of $2 trillion and achieve 20 million vehicles deliveries. Tesla delivered less than 2 million vehicles in 2024.

That milestone would also required a million robotaxis in commercial operation and the delivery of 1 million artificial intelligence bots.

Musk needs to remain with Tesla for at least seven and a half years to cash out on any stock, and 10 years to earn the full amount.

Musk has been one of the richest people in the world for several years.

Musk would also receive more voting power over Tesla under the proposed plan. The EV company is set to hold its annual shareholders meeting on Nov. 6. Tesla's last shareholders meeting was on June 13 of last year, where investors voted to restore Musk's record $44.9 billion pay package that was thrown out by a Delaware judge earlier that year.

A condition of the 11th and 12th tranches of the plan includes Musk coming up with a framework for someone to succeed him as CEO.

The goals set out for Musk and Tesla are extremely ambitious given recent tumult at the Texas company.

Tesla shares have plunged 25% this year largely due to blowback over Musk's affiliation with President Donald Trump. But Tesla also faces intensifying competition from the big Detroit automakers and particularly from China.

Telsa sales have fallen precipitously in Europe after Musk aligned with a far-right political party in German.

Sales plunged 40% in July in the 27 European Union countries compared with the year earlier even as sales overall of electric vehicle soared, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association. Meanwhile sales of Chinese rival BYD continued to climb fast, grabbing 1.1% market share of all car sales in the month versus Tesla's 0.7%.

In its most recent quarter, Tesla reported that quarterly profits plunged from $1.39 billion to $409 million. Revenue also fell and the company fell short of even the lowered expectations on Wall Street.

Investors have grown increasingly worried about the trajectory of the company after Musk had spent so much time in Washington this year, becoming one of the most prominent officials in the Trump administration in its bid to slash the size of the U.S. government.

Last month Tesla said that it gave Musk a stock grant of $29 billion as a reward for years of ""transformative and unprecedented"" growth despite a recent foray into right-wing politics that has hurt its sales, profits and its stock price.

The award arrived eight months after a judge revoked Musk's 2018 pay package for a second time, something the company noted in August. Tesla has appealed the ruling.

Tesla said at the time that the grant was a “first step, good faith” way of retaining Musk and keeping him focused, citing his leadership of SpaceX, xAI and other companies. Musk said recently that he needed more shares and control so he couldn’t be ousted by shareholder activists.

Tesla's stock rose nearly 2% in premarket trading.

v. Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana et al., case number 24-813, in the Supreme Court of the United States.","Chevron U.S.A. Inc. and Exxon Mobil Corp. announced today that they have formally petitioned the United States Supreme Court to review and overturn a decision by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals regarding ongoing litigation in Louisiana.

At the center of the Chevron and Exxon Supreme Court Louisiana pollution case is the question of whether claims related to World War II-era oil production should be heard in federal or state court. The Fifth Circuit previously ruled, in a split 2-1 decision, that Louisiana state courts were the proper venue.

Chevron and Exxon argue that the ruling misinterprets the federal officer removal statute, a law designed to ensure that companies and private actors assisting the U.S. government in carrying out critical national duties can litigate in federal court, free from potential local bias.

“The oil-production practices at issue in this litigation were integral to the nation’s World War II efforts,” Chevron and Exxon stated in their Supreme Court brief. “These cases belong in federal court.”

The litigation stems from lawsuits filed by Louisiana, its Department of Energy and Natural Resources, and several coastal parishes alleging that oil companies dredged coastal areas unlawfully while producing crude oil that was refined into aviation fuel for the U.S. military.

Chevron and Exxon emphasized that their corporate predecessors played a critical role in meeting wartime energy demands. They contend that the Fifth Circuit relied on an outdated legal standard and overlooked a 2011 amendment that broadened the scope of the federal officer removal statute.

“The connection between the challenged WWII-era oil production and the companies’ federally directed refining of aviation fuel is unmistakable,” the brief continued. The companies argue that imposing state-level restrictions at the time would have slowed oil production, driving up costs and undermining the nation’s ability to supply essential wartime fuel.

,American Energy,2025-09-05 12:28:21+00:00,New Atlas,TVA buys 6 GW of modular nuclear reactors in biggest US deal yet - New Atlas,"David Szondy, NuScale Energy, newatlas.com, david-szondy",,,,,https://newatlas.com/energy/6-gw-modular-nuclear-reactors-us/,"It seems that the United States is keen to get in on the nuclear renaissance as the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) has signed an agreement with Houston-based ENTRA1 Energy to build enough modular nuclear reactors to generate 6 GW of power.
Under the agreement, ENTRA1 will buy modular nuclear reactors from NuScale Energy in the largest deal of its kind in US history.
According to the agreement, ENTRA1 will build six new nuclear power plants in the TVA region.
The NuScale NPM is an advanced modular nuclear reactor that is the first small nuclear reactor to have its design certified by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).
In addition, the modular reactors use passive cooling systems, making them inherently safer than currently operating designs.","It seems that the United States is keen to get in on the nuclear renaissance as the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) has signed an agreement with Houston-based ENTRA1 Energy to build enough modular nuclear reactors to generate 6 GW of power.

The TVA was established by the Roosevelt administration in 1933 to combat the Great Depression by modernizing the US infrastructure in the Tennessee Valley, which spans seven states and was notorious for its devastating regular flooding. Under its brief, the TVA undertook a massive program of flood control, improvements of inland river navigation, general economic development, and the electrification of the American heartland.

Today, the TVA is a major player in the US energy sector and the latest agreement with ENTRA1 is a significant indicator of the direction of the country's energy policy. Under the agreement, ENTRA1 will buy modular nuclear reactors from NuScale Energy in the largest deal of its kind in US history.

According to the agreement, ENTRA1 will build six new nuclear power plants in the TVA region. These plants will be financed and owned by ENTRA1 and each will consist of 12 NuScale Power Modules (NPM) with an individual output of 77 MWe. This means that each plant will generate a total of 924 MWe per plant, with all six plants coming to a total of about 5.5 GW that will be sold directly to TVA. That's enough to power 4.5 million homes or 60 new data centers from a very small real estate footprint.

The NuScale NPM is an advanced modular nuclear reactor that is the first small nuclear reactor to have its design certified by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). Each reactor incorporates not only the reactor core, but the steam generators and pressurizer inside a single pressure vessel. This eliminates a lot of support equipment, like large-bore piping and coolant pumps found in conventional reactors, and allows the reactors to be mass produced in a factory and shipped to the site.

Once on site, the reactors can be installed underground, eliminating much of the civil engineering that makes up most of the cost of a nuclear plant. If more power is needed, more reactors can be installed and when the reactors reach the end of their service life, they can be shipped back to the factory for disposal. In addition, the modular reactors use passive cooling systems, making them inherently safer than currently operating designs.

However, this agreement doesn't exist in isolation. The US Department of Energy recently released an infographic outlining future American nuclear policy, which includes expanding nuclear power output by 300 GW by 2050, speeding plant testing and certification, building a nuclear plant on a US military site within three years, increasing nuclear fuel production, studying re-implementing fuel reprocessing in the US to cut down on waste, and increasing US nuclear exports.

""TVA is leading the nation in pursuing new nuclear technologies, and no utility in the US is working harder or faster than TVA,"" said Don Moul, TVA President and CEO. ""This agreement with ENTRA1 Energy highlights the vital role public-private partnerships play in advancing next-generation nuclear technologies that are essential to providing energy security – reliable, abundant American energy – and creating jobs and investment across the nation.""",https://assets.newatlas.com/dims4/default/03424cb/2147483647/strip/true/crop/455x239+0+72/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewatlas-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fba%2Fe8%2Fd4a7ca7545e2968956429510ae6d%2F12hd.jpg&na.image_optimisation=0,N,,2025-09-05 09:00:47.641219

President Donald Trump had campaigned against the EV tax credit and other rules trying to promote EV affordability and acceptance.
Some EV buyers can tap into a deduction for car loans In some cases, EV buyers could get two tax breaks.
Every EV sold doesn't qualify for an EV tax credit When you're buying an EV, the make and model and the MSRP matter.
Thanks to the EV leasing loophole, though, she said, virtually any EV can qualify for what's known as a commercial clean vehicle tax credit.","Anyone who is even remotely considering getting a new car cannot help but notice that the Sept. 30 deadline for snagging a tax credit of up to $7,500 on a qualifying, new electric vehicle is right around the corner.

The deadline is everywhere you look, including auto websites and ads. Some dealers are running banner headlines on their sites proclaiming: ""Plug in before it powers down.""

But here's a new twist: It's possible that you might — emphasis on the word ""might"" — not need to take delivery by Sept. 30. Just get a deal done in writing with money down to buy the qualifying EV by Sept. 30, according to a tidbit in a new Internal Revenue Service post.

Potential buyers originally were told that they must take delivery of that electric car or truck or plug-in hybrid model on or before Sept. 30 to be eligible for the lucrative tax credit.

On Aug. 21, though, the IRS indicated that a vehicle would be viewed as ""acquired"" if the buyer has ""a written, binding contract"" and made a payment on or before Sept. 30. A payment includes a nominal down payment or a vehicle trade-in.

The IRS noted that the clean vehicle credit could be claimed even if the vehicle is placed in service after Sept. 30. We're talking about a key change here.

""Taxpayers should receive a time of sale report from the dealer at the time they take possession or within three days of taking possession of the vehicle,"" the IRS stated in a newly issued ""frequently asked questions"" update.

We have tax rules, of course, and then we have what's likely to be reality.

Unfortunately, buying now and taking delivery after Sept. 30 is a tax tip that sounds straightforward. Yet, frankly, car buyers could end up frustrated if they drag their feet too far into September to do an EV deal.

Days after the IRS issued its FAQ, some auto dealers were still asking attorneys to figure out how enabling a consumer to take a late delivery could actually work without running afoul of other rules, including deadlines for state title and registration.

""It's clear cut as far as the IRS is concerned,"" said Dave Katarski, chief operating officer for Feldman Automotive Group.

""I don't necessarily know how to put the puzzle together for the consumer yet,"" Katarski told the Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network, on Aug. 28.

Late in August, he said, the objective continued to be to move metal off the lots by Sept. 30.

Theoretically, though, Car and Driver magazine notes online: ""Automakers should also be able to leverage this rule to use the tax credit as an incentive to sell as many EVs as possible before the end of September, as long as the customers are willing to wait for delivery.""

Online, Feldman Chevrolet of Novi is running a countdown clock, listing the days, hours, minutes and seconds left before the Sept. 30 deadline. ""Secure your $7,500 EV Tax Credit Before the Battery Runs Out on This Offer!""

Those who pull up to the showroom on Grand River Avenue in Novi, though, don't see a single sign plastered on the windows to fuel last-minute EV sales.

Tim Brown, EV specialist and sales consultant at Feldman Chevrolet of Novi, said customers don't need a poster to remind them that what's essentially a $7,500 government subsidy will end soon.

""I promise you, they know it,"" Brown said, adding that plenty of news outlets have been talking about the end of the tax break.

Through the end of September, many EV buyers are able to get $7,500 off the sticker price — on top of any incentives on the vehicle — on the spot if they qualify. For some, it means they'd need less money for a down payment.

Beginning in 2024, qualified buyers could opt to transfer the clean vehicle credit directly to a registered car dealer instead of waiting to claim the credit on a federal income tax return the next year.

""Everybody wants a lower price,"" said Brown, who has worked at the dealership for eight years.

Some buyers, he said, even have turned to EVs when they're dealing with negative equity on an old car loan — or owe more on the car loan than what the car they're trying to trade in is worth.

Auto financing advice: How to get the best car loan before you visit the dealership

The $7,500 tax credit, plus any other rebates available, he said, has helped those who are upside down on their car loans work the numbers in their favor enough to get a new car.

Many people who bought cars during the pandemic, for example, paid shockingly high, premium prices for those vehicles and could still owe a good deal of money on their loans even after trading in the car.

""The EV has been a godsend to many people in that position,"" Brown said. ""It was the difference between them being stuck in a car or having a car that they could actually (buy) and get out of that situation and being in a better spot.""

Even older adults who might be less willing to adjust to a new technology, Brown said, reconsidered EVs once they understood how the $7,500 federal tax credit might work in their favor.

""Money will make people figure out how to charge things,"" Brown said.

Katarski agreed. He estimated that EV sales could be up 8% or 10% in August at Feldman Chevrolet, Chevy's No. 1 largest-selling EV dealer nationwide in 2024 and year to date.

According to Katarski, some who previously vowed that they would never drive an EV have found themselves saying: ""You know what I'll give it a go for a $247 a month lease payment.""

Cox Automotive noted in an Aug. 27 report that the EV market saw significant growth in July; and sales incentives on EVs were at record highs in July.

July new EV sales climbed to an estimated 130,082 units, up 26.4% month over month and 19.7% year over year, according to Cox Automotive, with 11 brands posting their best EV sales of the year in July.

""July recorded the second-highest EV sales in history, and August is expected to also see large gains,"" according to Charlie Chesbrough, senior economist at Cox Automotive.

Nothing, of course, is truly simple when it comes to car shopping, EVs and tax credits. Those tempted by all the last-minute EV buzz should take a hard look under the hood as the Sept. 30 deadline approaches.

The federal EV tax credit was set to expire at the end of 2032, but the mega-tax bill signed into law in July pushed that expiration deadline up to Sept. 30. President Donald Trump had campaigned against the EV tax credit and other rules trying to promote EV affordability and acceptance.

How to claim a clean vehicle tax credit

Taxpayers who buy qualifying EVs or plug-in hybrid models before Sept. 30 could be able to claim the tax credit on their 2025 federal income tax returns when they file next year.

But there's another option, which many buyers use now. Buyers are allowed to transfer the credit to the dealer at the time of the sale. In that case, you will not get extra tax savings from the clean vehicle credit when filing a 2025 return.

Either way, you're going to need paperwork to prove that you qualify for the credit. Save copies of the signed contract, payment receipt and dealer’s point-of-sale paperwork.

If the buyer takes the credit upfront at the time of purchase but ultimately doesn't qualify for the credit, the buyer owes the IRS. The buyer must repay the full value of the tax credit to the IRS when filing a tax return.

Why would someone not qualify? Maybe, you made too much money.

One rule of the game: You can only qualify for the clean vehicle credit when buying an EV if your modified adjusted gross income does not exceed $300,000 for married couples filing jointly; $225,000 for heads of households, and $150,000 for all other filers.

When it comes to income limits, you can use your modified AGI from the year you take delivery of the vehicle or the year before, whichever is less, according to the IRS.

The credit is nonrefundable when you file your taxes, so you can't get back more on the credit than you owe in taxes for 2025 if you do not transfer the credit to the dealer at purchase time. You can't apply any excess credit to future tax years.

Alison Flores, manager with The Tax Institute at H&R Block, noted that it's important to ask your dealer for a ""Time of Sale"" report, which documents the purchase date and other required details for claiming the EV tax credit.

EV buyers, Flores said, must work with a car dealer who is registered, or will register, for the clean vehicle credit program through the energy credits online portal by Sept. 30.

The auto dealer completes a Form 15400 ""Clean Vehicle Seller Report,"" which includes the VIN number for the electric car or truck that you bought, the Social Security number of the buyer and other information. That form is essential at tax time whether you will claim the credit on your return, or your dealer provided the tax credit on the spot, such as through down payment assistance.

The IRS automated its systems so that it could give real time verification based on the vehicle identification number.

What to know about the latest IRS twist

In August, IRS brought up the possibility of taking delivery after Sept. 30 in an FAQ. But an FAQ doesn't mean every issue has been settled. An FAQ can be modified down the road.

""Because these FAQs have not been published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin, they will not be relied on or used by the IRS to resolve a case,"" the IRS states.

""Nonetheless,"" the IRS notes, ""a taxpayer who reasonably and in good faith relies on these FAQs will not be subject to a penalty that provides a reasonable cause standard for relief, including a negligence penalty or other accuracy-related penalty, to the extent that reliance results in an underpayment of tax.""

Even so, experts say now potential EV buyers who follow other requirements likely could take delivery later than Sept. 30 — such as when a local dealer does a swap with an out-of-town dealer to get you the exact EV that you'd like to buy — and still qualify for the credit.

""Once you take possession of the qualifying EV, you can take the credit,"" said Flores, at H&R Block. ""Possession of the vehicle is still necessary to claim the credit.""

Everyone doesn't get $7,500

The credits can be up to $7,500 for eligible new EVs and up to $4,000 for eligible used electric vehicles.

For vehicles placed in service April 18, 2023, and after, you'd receive up to $3,750 if the vehicle meets the critical minerals requirement only. An eligible clean vehicle can't contain any critical minerals that were sourced by a ""foreign entity of concern,"" such as China.

Or you'd receive up to $3,750 if the vehicle meets the battery components requirement only. Or you'd receive up to $7,500 if the new qualifying EV meets both.

Some EV buyers can tap into a deduction for car loans

In some cases, EV buyers could get two tax breaks.

Some buyers might be able to claim the clean vehicle tax credit and a deduction on car loan interest when they file their 2025 income tax returns in 2026. Review all the rules. The income limits vary for the different tax breaks, for example, so not everyone will qualify.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law by Trump on July 4, introduces a deduction of up to $10,000 a year for car loan interest on loans originated after Dec. 31, 2024.

The new car or truck that you bought with the auto loan must have had its final assembly in the United States. The purchase of a new car — used cars don't qualify — must take place in 2025 or after.

The income limit for the deduction for car loan interest is much lower than the limit for the clean vehicle credit.

The deduction for car loan interest, on the other hand, starts phasing out at a much lower income level. It phases out by $200 for every $1,000 of modified adjusted gross income above $100,000 for single filers and $200,000 for joint filers.

The new car loan deduction only applies in 2025, 2026, 2027 and 2028.

Both itemizers and nonitemizers can claim the car loan interest deduction. The same's true with the clean vehicle tax credit.

Every EV sold doesn't qualify for an EV tax credit

When you're buying an EV, the make and model and the MSRP matter. Make sure the vehicle meets the price caps to qualify for the credit. The manufacturer's suggested retail price, or MSRP, according to the IRS, may not exceed $80,000 for vans, SUVs and pickup trucks, and $55,000 for other vehicles.

The credits do not apply to every package offered on some electric car or truck or plug-in hybrid models.

Check out the details at FuelEconomy.gov to search for eligible vehicles. Independent websites, such as Edmunds, also list eligible vehicles.

Many opt to lease EVs to save money

A loophole in the tax credit, which was part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, gave dealers a unique ability to promote highly attractive leases for new EVs and plug-in hybrids. You'd need to lease before Sept. 30 to benefit.

Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive, told the Detroit Free Press that only about 20 electric and plug-in hybrid models are eligible for the clean vehicle credit of up to $7,500 for consumers.

Thanks to the EV leasing loophole, though, she said, virtually any EV can qualify for what's known as a commercial clean vehicle tax credit. And the driver's income isn't taken into account with leasing.

""If you don’t meet income or sourcing requirements, leasing can still unlock the full credit,"" Valdez Streaty said.

If you lease, you cannot claim the tax credit when you file your 2025 federal income tax return for added savings.

Jessica Caldwell, head of insights for Edmunds, said automakers are promoting leases now to move EV inventory by the Sept. 30 deadline and win over first-time EV drivers who could keep coming back as EV adoption grows.

According to Edmunds data, leases made up 70% of EV transactions in July, compared with 10% for the same month three years ago before the loophole went into place.

The savings involved with leasing potentially could amount to about $208 a month, according to Edmunds.com, if you spread a $7,500 tax credit across a 36-month lease.

Lease deals can be highly regional and vary. Some lease deals will require a bigger down payment so that you can have lower monthly payments.

I spotted a 24-month lease deal in metro Detroit at $249 a month for a 2025 Chevrolet Equinox EV with $3,049 due at signing, according to Edmunds.com data. That deal ran through Sept. 2 in several states, as of late August.

Capital Hyundai of San Jose, California, had some 36-month, low-mileage lease deals at $99 to $199 a month on clean vehicles in late August with $4,998 in cash due at signing.

Valdez Streaty suggests that last-minute shoppers compare offers across dealer websites and EV marketplaces. Check for state or local EV incentives and utility rebates. Look for manufacturer promotions that can stack on top of the clean vehicle credit.

Be flexible in September. ""Inventory is tightening, so consider multiple models or trims,"" Valdez Streaty said.

BHS I represents ContourGlobal’s first operating renewable plant in the US and the initial phase of the Black Hollow Sun complex, which will also include BHS II (139 MWp). When fully completed in 2026, the power complex will reach a total capacity of 324 MWp, making it Northern Colorado’s largest solar project and Platte River’s largest contracted solar asset.

Once fully operational, the complex will produce around 608 GWh of clean energy each year, which will be delivered to Platte River Power Authority, the community-owned utility serving Fort Collins, Loveland, Estes Park, and Longmont. This is enough clean electricity to power more than 73 000 homes in Northern Colorado while avoiding almost 450 000 tpy of CO2 emissions.

This milestone marked a highlight of ContourGlobal’s 20th anniversary celebrations, underscoring both its origins in the US two decades ago, and its commitment to becoming a predominantly renewable independent power producer (IPP).

Antonio Cammisecra, CEO of ContourGlobal, responded: “The start of operations at BHS I is a pivotal moment for ContourGlobal, marking our first US renewable plant to reach operational state, and especially meaningful as we celebrate our 20th anniversary since the company was incorporated in the US. This project, together with BHS II, targeted for completion by the end of 2026, exemplifies our strategy to deliver clean, reliable power while strengthening our commitment to local communities and partners such as Platte River Power Authority.”

As part of its 20-year presence in US energy, ContourGlobal is using US-manufactured solar modules supplied by its partner Qcells, which is also providing its integrated engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) solutions for this project.

The completion of BHS I adds 185 MWp of new renewable capacity to ContourGlobal’s overall US portfolio, which now totals 2.8 GW of power generation capacity in operation, under construction, or in late-stage of development.

The company’s current operational portfolio (1.5 GW) also includes a thermal fleet of 10 plants located in California, New Mexico, and Texas, as well as a light fuel oil plant in Connecticut.

ContourGlobal’s planned renewable capacity in the US includes an additional 1 GW of solar PV and 0.3 GW of battery energy storage system projects at various stages of maturity, from late development to advanced construction.

The BHS I facility, located in Weld County, near the town of Severance and only about 16 miles east of Fort Collins, is the first phase of the larger BHS complex, originally developed by Hanwha Renewables and acquired by ContourGlobal earlier in 2025.

Utility scale solar projects like BHS I generate significant local benefits by engaging hundreds of skilled workers and regional partners during each construction phase. For BHS I, the construction period created approximately 450 direct jobs and 250 indirect jobs, strengthening the local economy through partnerships with contractors, suppliers, and service providers across the region.

With BHS I now proceeding to commercial operation, construction on BHS II (139 MWp) is well underway. Both phases were designed to integrate seamlessly through shared infrastructure, optimising land use and technical efficiency. BHS II is expected to begin operations by end of 2026.

But even if the new laws don’t pass the Senate, the Trump administration is already reshaping coal policy.","President Donald Trump has made reviving the coal industry a political and policy priority in his second term, swimming against the current of a domestic—and international—market that’s increasingly turned away from the fuel source. A Wednesday hearing of the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources, on two bills aiming to bolster the U.S. coal industry, showcased the debate around the use of federal lands, the nation’s energy future and the fate of the world’s oldest fossil fuel.

During the hearing, Republican lawmakers lauded coal as indispensable to U.S. energy security and blasted federal oversight as a bureaucratic chokehold suffocating the mining industry. Democrats and environmental groups dismissed the bills as a symbolic and misguided attempt to rescue U.S. coal production, arguing that the policies would fail to revive jobs and succeed only in worsening emissions and undermining progress on climate policy.

“We’re seeing a complete cognitive dissonance,” Cameron Walkup, a legislative representative for environmental law nonprofit Earthjustice, told Inside Climate News. “These two bills are designed to ignore the coal industry’s impacts on communities and the environment, and instead just prop up a failing industry.”

The Combating Obstruction Against Leasing, or COAL Act of 2025 (H.R. 280) cements a streamlining of the approval of federal coal leases and overrides the Obama administration’s 2016 moratorium on new coal leases. During Trump’s first term, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke revoked the order, but the 2025 version of the COAL Act goes further by nullifying it and aims to prevent any future administrations from restoring the moratorium or similar leasing halts.

Rep. Harriet Hageman (R-Wyo.), who introduced the COAL Act, emphasized Wyoming’s dominant role in coal—her state has led U.S. coal production for years, accounting for around 40 percent of the nation’s supply—and criticized the uncertainty created by the Obama and Biden administrations’ leasing pauses.

“When the federal government tries to destroy Wyoming’s coal industry, it ends up turning the lights out and the heat off in America,” Hageman said.

Bill Would Let Coal Projects Skip Environmental Studies

The second bill under debate Wednesday would amend the landmark 1970 National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), a legal backbone of federal environmental protections. The Streamlining NEPA for Coal Act (H.R. 4068), creates new exemptions for coal projects, regulatory shortcuts that could allow coal projects to bypass standard environmental reviews.

“What was once meant to be a tool for reasonable oversight has become a weapon used to block development, delay jobs and drive up costs,” said Rep. Mike Collins (R-Ga.), who sponsored H.R. 4068. “This is simply not sustainable if we want to remain an energy-producing nation.”

Collins characterized NEPA as a “maze of reviews, red tape and litigation” that had caused “paralyzing delays” by mandating environmental studies, a process he called “outdated.”

“This is about cutting delays, not cutting corners,” Collins said. “Coal has powered this nation for generations … but without reform, the regulatory burden will continue to strangle the industry.”

For environmental policy advocates like Walkup, who described NEPA as “the environmental Magna Carta,” the law may be old, but it’s become a more critical protection for American communities.

“Coal mines have enormous environmental impacts, from the greenhouse gas emissions that are warming our climate to the impact on local water resources,” Walkup said. “Allowing these kinds of projects to just completely skirt environmental review is incredibly damaging.

“Coal continues to be in decline, and little tweaks of regulatory policies aren’t going to change the market dynamics, but they still have significant negative impacts for the communities that are burdened with these projects,” he added.

Steve Feldgus, a former senior Interior official under the Biden administration, testified before the subcommittee that gutting NEPA would backfire. “Environmental reviews are not what’s slowing mining projects down—community opposition is. When we eliminate opportunities to address opposition constructively … we simply force it into courtrooms.”

Feldgus said bypassing NEPA environmental reviews and engagement with affected communities would “take potential collaboration and turn it into confrontation, and instead of partners, we create plaintiffs.

“Projects don’t succeed because we add more shortcuts to the process. They succeed because agencies doing the permitting have the resources they need to do the job properly, and they succeed because they earn community trust and support,” he said.

Congressional Efforts Align with Administration’s Broader Goals

Trump’s assault on climate policy in his second term has included gutting regulatory agencies and research, killing renewable power projects, firing National Parks and Forest Service employees, encouraging drilling on federal lands and rescinding rules that lower pollution and protect Americans’ health.

Adam Suess, the acting assistant secretary for lands and minerals management at the Department of the Interior, made clear during the hearing that the Trump administration sees both bills as essential.

“We are working steadfastly and tirelessly to implement the president’s energy dominance agenda, which is central to the country’s economic, national and energy security. Each of the bills advanced at today’s hearing further that agenda,” Suess testified. “As President Trump has reaffirmed, American coal plays a pivotal part in our economy. It will continue to power the country for many decades to come.”

Calling Suess’ testimony an attempt to “deflect,” Rep. Yassamin Ansari (D-Ariz.) said “it is undeniable that the cheapest form of energy is wind and solar, and yet this administration is waging war against renewables while making every attempt to prop up dirty, expensive coal.”

Suess pushed back against criticisms of coal’s economic feasibility and harm to the environment. Suess said renewables, like wind and solar, are “seven, eight, nine, 10 times as expensive as coal and natural gas,” adding that “technological advances in burning coal make it incredibly clean, and so there’s no downside in my view.”

That claim is at odds with a recent report, which found solar and wind remain the cheapest sources of electricity, even without subsidies. Financial advisory firm Lazard, in an analysis published last June, determined that “utility-scale solar and onshore wind remain the most cost-effective forms of new-build energy generation on an unsubsidized basis.”

“Coal had its time and place, it powered the Industrial Revolution—thank you, coal!—but we are long past steam engines now.”

— Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.)

Several Republicans used their questioning to underscore coal’s importance to their states and constituents. Rep. Jeff Crank (R-Colo.) warned that closing coal plants prematurely would burden his state’s households. “Analysis has shown in Colorado that shutting down coal plants will increase Colorado utility bills by $75 a month,” Crank said. “Affordable and reliable energy must remain accessible to everyone, and coal continues to be one of the cheapest and most dependable base load power sources in our country.”

Democrats argued that while affordability and energy production should be top concerns for legislators, the new bills focused on coal were a step in the wrong direction.

“These bills won’t bring those factories back, just as the giveaways for coal and bills on the agenda won’t make coal dominant again,” Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) said. “Coal had its time and place, it powered the Industrial Revolution—thank you, coal!—but we are long past steam engines now.

“Coal is simply too expensive and destructive to continue propping it up.”

How Trump’s Agenda Is Already Affecting Coal Mining

With Republicans in control of the House, the bills are likely to move out of committee. But even if the new laws don’t pass the Senate, the Trump administration is already reshaping coal policy.

The bills debated Wednesday largely codify or overlap with elements of Trump’s coal policies already enacted through executive orders or provisions of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) passed in July. That law, Trump’s most significant domestic policy achievement since returning to office, notably accelerated the phase-out of wind and solar tax credits, reducing federal incentives for renewables while extending new support for coal.

Alan Zibel, a research director at D.C.-based public advocacy group Public Citizen, told Inside Climate News that “reopening the formerly resolved question on coal’s future is one of the most damaging things Trump has done so far.”

“This administration is determined to give fossil fuel interests everything they want, including and especially the dirtiest industry—coal—in deliberate ignorance of the fact coal doesn’t make any economic sense anymore,” Zibel said. “Coal is not the future of American energy, and no amount of subsidies or giveaways or regulatory favors will change that.”

The OBBBA, alongside executive orders, also extended production tax credits for metallurgical coal—the variety used in steelmaking— and reclassified it as a “critical material.”

Zibel said that move, in particular, sparked genuine confusion among climate advocates, including him and his colleagues. “Metallurgical coal has been a dead issue; it’s what the environmental community worked on a decade ago. Everyone’s moved on.”

“We can’t build the economy of the future by clinging to the dirty technologies of the past,” he added.

Chelsea Barnes, director of government strategy for environmental advocacy group Appalachian Voices, said that while metallurgical coal has been a “lifeline for the industry” in West Virginia, the new tax credits won’t overcome the damage other Trump policies have already done to mining. “Who’s going to buy this coal?” Barnes asked rhetorically. “The tariffs have shut down the sales pipelines that were kind of available to them.”

Barnes said the Trump administration’s wave of new policies has hurt the coal industry in Appalachia more than it has helped. Around 700 miners and others who work in the industry have been laid off this summer alone in West Virginia. Barnes attributed those layoffs to a drop in demand and price for metallurgical coal stemming from Trump’s tariffs. “But I don’t know that you’ll hear a coal company say that, because they don’t want to speak ill of President Trump,” Barnes added.

Barnes said demand for metallurgical coal also dropped when Trump cut numerous planned infrastructure projects, including development tied to the Biden administration’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. “If the Trump administration and Republicans were actually interested in seeing a resurgence in domestic manufacturing and metallurgical coal mining, they wouldn’t be gutting these new clean energy and infrastructure programs,” she said.

Coal miners themselves have also suffered from Trump’s cutbacks, according to Barnes.

“They’ve fired employees at the Mine Safety and Health Administration and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health that administer black lung programs and keep miners safe, gutting their budgets. They’re trying to create this resurgence of coal while killing all the protections for the miners they supposedly want those jobs for,” Barnes said. “There’s a bit of hypocrisy there.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-1245008665-1024x682.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 09:01:03.044652

What Can Activists Do?,"Christina Cauterucci, www.nytimes.com, christina-cauterucci",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/05/magazine/climate-change-activism-renewable-energy.html,"Few climate activists have participated in more eras of the environmental movement than McKibben.
Over the decades, he has evolved from a concerned observer to an elder statesman of the climate movement.
His own shift in strategy comes as many activists are asking themselves some difficult questions: What has climate activism really given us?
Ronald Reagan’s election in 1980 helped spur a new generation of environmental activists, McKibben among them.
He mocked-up ads on newsprint, each with a different name: World Day, Ecology Day, E-Day, Earth Day.","At the end of a long dirt road through Vermont’s Green Mountains, Bill McKibben sat on his screened-in porch, surrounded by birdsong and the drone of buzzing insects. The July sun beat through a canopy of trees. McKibben sipped a cup of green tea and pointed outside, to the ground just past the edge of the house, where an array of solar panels tilted toward the late-morning sky. The roof, too, was loaded with panels of different vintages. “I’ve been putting them up at intervals for a quarter century,” he said.

Few climate activists have participated in more eras of the environmental movement than McKibben. In 1989, at age 27, he published “The End of Nature,” often described as the first book on global warming for lay readers, which became an international best seller. Then he turned to activism, eventually shifting his focus from combating the “greenhouse effect” to organizing pipeline protests and fossil fuel divestment campaigns. Over the decades, he has evolved from a concerned observer to an elder statesman of the climate movement.

I met McKibben at a uniquely bleak time for that movement. Republicans in Congress had shredded the Inflation Reduction Act, a Biden administration law meant in part to lower greenhouse gas emissions, and President Trump was making every effort to thwart progress on renewables while boosting the oil-and-gas industry. The president had also pulled the United States out of the Paris Agreement, a climate accord that advocacy groups had helped catalyze. “In certain ways, it’s the darkest moment,” McKibben said.

With Sun Day, McKibben hopes to recapture the spirit of the first Earth Day, in 1970, the earliest wide-scale mobilization of the environmental movement, which helped catapult issues like pollution and conservation onto the national agenda. Like Earth Day, McKibben told me, Sun Day is meant to be “a giant potluck supper” for activists around the country: “We’ve set the date and the theme, and everyone’s bringing their own dish to the floor.”

In some ways, focusing on renewable energy right now is a logical bet. In March, the United States hit a new milestone when fossil fuels generated less than half the nation’s electricity. In June, solar was the largest source of electricity for the European Union for the first time ever. Last year, over 90 percent of new power globally came from clean-energy sources. The United Nations announced in July that solar power is now on average 41 percent cheaper than fossil fuels. “For the very first time in this saga, the force of economic gravity is working in the right direction,” McKibben said. His hope is that engaging people in small ways, where they live, could hasten the clean-energy transition that is already underway in the U.S.

But Sun Day also feels like a tactical swerve for McKibben. Climate activism over the past decade has been defined by global protests against fossil fuels, by Greta Thunberg’s student strikes, by the emergence of the Sunrise Movement. McKibben has been among the strongest exponents of that era’s climate-activism strategy — confrontational, morally stark, bent on shutting down economic activity that endangered humanity in the long-term even if it meant reducing corporate profits and curtailing Americans’ lifestyle options in the short term.

Now McKibben is taking a different tack, one that seems to share a message with a more moderate, adaptationist wing of the climate world while also harking back to the innocence and idealism of Earth Day. “This is clearly the thing that we can work on at the moment that stands a chance of making a difference,” he told me. His own shift in strategy comes as many activists are asking themselves some difficult questions: What has climate activism really given us? And where should it go from here?

American public opinion on climate has arrived at a complicated juncture. In a Gallup poll this year, a record 48 percent of respondents said that global warming will pose a “serious threat” to them or their way of life. People can feel the hotter summers, the snowless winters, the hurricanes raging harder. Some surveys have found evidence among Republicans, too, of a willingness to link extreme weather to climate change. Yet when asked to rank the issues that affect their votes, Americans regularly place climate near the bottom of the list.

And so for many people who are passionate about the climate threat, recent years have inspired a difficult reckoning about the power of climate activism and its limits. “You can make a pretty decent case that everything that I’ve worked on in my entire professional life has gone down the toilet in the last six months,” said Denis Hayes, 81, a longtime environmental activist who was the lead organizer of the first Earth Day, when we spoke in July. Varshini Prakash, 32, a co-founder of the Sunrise Movement, told me that she once believed activists could pressure governments to make changes that might stop global warming outright. Now, she said, “I think that window has closed, and perhaps it never really existed.”

There was a moment, five and a half decades ago, when such a window seemed to swing open. On April 22, 1970, Hayes sat in the back of a truck, marveling at the biggest crowd he had ever seen. The throng of demonstrators stretched so far down New York’s Fifth Avenue that it seemed to disappear over the curvature of the earth. “It was like looking at the ocean over the horizon,” Hayes told me.

Earth Day began in a meeting room above a fast-food restaurant in Washington, D.C., where Gaylord Nelson, a Democratic senator from Wisconsin, had tasked a group of mostly 20-somethings with planning a national day of environmental action. A friend of Nelson’s had offered them free office space in a downtown building, but the activists worried it seemed too corporate. So they found some grungier digs where smoke from the downstairs burger joint blew through the ventilation system. Hayes, then 25, and the other organizers took out a full-page ad in The New York Times: “On April 22,” it read, “we start to reclaim the environment we have wrecked.”

In those days, city skies were dark with smog. Pesticides were rampant. In 1969, oil slicks defiled the beaches of Santa Barbara, Calif., and caught fire on Cleveland’s Cuyahoga River. The environmental devastation that had accompanied the nation’s economic growth was largely taken as a given. “There were all kinds of individual efforts to deal with particular issues, from sprawl to pollution to endangered species,” said the environmental historian Adam Rome. But until Earth Day, “no one had a sense that they all were part of one big cause.”

That mobilization came on the heels of the civil rights era, a time of great confidence in the power of grass-roots activism to produce radical change. A White House poll in 1969 found that 1 percent of respondents thought protecting the environment was important; by 1971, one-quarter did. Little political opposition rose up to meet Earth Day outside the far-right John Birch Society, which labeled it a communist plot. Congress closed for the day, and two-thirds of its members spoke at Earth Day events.

Within three months, Richard Nixon introduced the Environmental Protection Agency; within three years, Congress passed the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act. Leaded gasoline was phased out. Superfund cleanups were phased in. One survey showed concern about air pollution doubling over the course of just three years during the mid-1970s.

Ronald Reagan’s election in 1980 helped spur a new generation of environmental activists, McKibben among them. McKibben has written that, as a student at Harvard on election night, he “got grimly drunk,” spending the next day in bed before waking to write a Harvard Crimson essay about America’s turn away from moral responsibility and collectivist thinking. After graduation, McKibben became a staff writer at The New Yorker.

In 1988, the NASA scientist James Hansen testified to the Senate that burning fossil fuels was heating the Earth, helping to reframe the national debate as one about human-made climate change rather than just environmental preservation. Through the years that followed, political opposition intensified. In 1997, McKibben — who by then had moved into organizing — attended the U.N. gathering that yielded the Kyoto Protocol, a landmark treaty committing developed nations to reducing emissions. After the agreement was reached, McKibben found himself next to a fossil fuel lobbyist who had formerly worked for an automobile trade association. The lobbyist told McKibben he was “eager to get back to Washington, where we’ve got all this under control.”

“I thought he was kind of whistling past the graveyard,” McKibben said. “But he had a better sense of the political realities than I did.”

In 1990, 73 percent of Gallup poll respondents called themselves “environmentalists.” A decade later, this had fallen to 47 percent. Still, a strong majority of Americans in one 1997 Pew survey said they would accept higher gasoline prices if it would help mitigate climate change.

McKibben, meanwhile, spent years trying out different forms of climate activism. In the early aughts, he started a campaign against S.U.V.s; activists picketed car dealerships and offered test drives in their Priuses. Some evangelical communities joined in under the slogan “What Would Jesus Drive?” “It was good, and obviously it was a failure,” McKibben said. “Americans just kept driving bigger and bigger and bigger cars.”

These were also the years when the Paris Agreement was adopted, propelled partly by activists from small island nations, and when Thunberg began skipping school on Fridays to protest for climate action. In the lead-up to the 2021 U.N. climate conference in Glasgow, the visibility of those demonstrations helped pressure dozens of banks to pledge to reach net-zero emissions across their investments by 2050. In those days, one could look around and easily believe that this brand of in-your-face climate activism might win the future — that activists could push people in power to keep fossil fuels in the ground.

But the breakthroughs didn’t last long. The problem wasn’t just Trump; over the past few years, climate has receded as a priority throughout the political and corporate worlds. “The banks and others who made commitments at Glasgow just turned out to be liars,” McKibben said. According to Luisa Neubauer, 29, a prominent activist who helped organize school strikes in Germany as a college student, momentum among young climate advocates petered out for several reasons, including the pandemic, the challenge of keeping students engaged after graduation and Israel’s war on Gaza, to which many activists — including Thunberg — turned their energy. “We were on the streets, hundreds of people, every Friday,” Neubauer said. “Were they seriously thinking that teenagers would do this for a decade?” On the weekend of Sun Day, she plans to join a series of demonstrations called Draw the Line, which 350.org helped organize. Though Neubauer will be focusing on clean energy, these protests illustrate the expanded range of priorities for young activists now: Draw the Line is pushing not just for a transition away from fossil fuels but for the redistribution of global wealth and an end to wars and genocide.

The climate activism of the last 15 years wasn’t fruitless. Prakash believes the divestment effort didn’t just lead hundreds of institutions to take their money out of fossil fuels; it also mainstreamed the idea that “we were fighting with fossil capital,” not just climate ignorance. One study found that 350.org’s divestment campaigns shifted public debate by providing a radical flank, such that more moderate calls to climate action seemed reasonable by comparison.

Still, Prakash worries that the era of digital organizing that arose in the 2010s saw organizations reactivate the same people again and again, without making moves to engage a broader audience that might have notched more political wins. Among her peers, she sees mounting frustration with the climate movement’s strategies of the past few years — “a tendency toward over-mobilization,” she said, “with diminishing impact.”

With the sun high in the sky, McKibben and I climbed into his electric Kia, which was cluttered with outdoor gear. On the way to visit a solar installation in a neighboring town, he crossed a double-yellow line to zoom past a slowpoke on the road, showing off an impressive rate of acceleration. “Electric cars!” he exclaimed.

McKibben makes a very compelling pitchman. He is tall and wiry, his brows perpetually furrowed, giving him a look of mild alarm. As he talks, he slides easily from wide-eyed enthusiasm (“The liberating effects of clean energy are astonishing”) into a mode of urgent admonition (on clean energy, “the Chinese are going to completely own the future”). And he knows, perhaps better than anyone, how difficult the climate movement is to brand.

One of McKibben’s goals for Sun Day was to urge officials in blue states and cities to remove permitting barriers for solar installation. But “if you set out to do a campaign about solar-permitting reform, the problem is that you’ve now picked a couple of the most boring words in the English language,” he said.

He originally wanted to call his day of action Sky Day, to encompass both solar power and carbon emissions. But when a design firm ginned up ideas for logos, every option depicted the sun. “It just became clear to me that you can’t really draw a picture of the sky,” McKibben said. He decided that there was also a catchy symmetry to the sun’s role in the problem of climate change. “We’ve managed to screw up our relationship with the sun,” McKibben said. “We’re trapping too much of its heat, and now we have to fix that relationship. It just so happens that the sun provides the easiest way.” The Sun Day website invites people to submit their own drawings of the sun, examples of which flash brightly across the homepage.

Positioning Sun Day politically was a challenge, too. Jamie Henn — a climate activist who co-founded 350.org with McKibben and has been working on Sun Day — said in a recent interview with the podcast Volts that, when they began organizing Sun Day, he thought, “One of the things that the clean-energy movement needs is a really good villain.” But then they tested some language along the lines of “Big Oil is standing in the way of solar. Trump doesn’t want you to have it.” The response, Henn said, was more or less: “I don’t want to hear this stuff — like, I’m already depressed.”

Even in simpler times for environmental activism, messaging could be tricky. In 1970, Senator Nelson originally conceived of Earth Day as a nationwide “Environmental Teach-in” on college campuses. But Hayes and his staff found that the name turned people off. “It was academic, and it sounded a little bit preachy, and it sounded passé,” like a relic of the Vietnam years, Hayes told me. Then, one day, an advertising executive who had created Volkswagen’s “Think Small” campaign swung by their office and offered to help. He mocked-up ads on newsprint, each with a different name: World Day, Ecology Day, E-Day, Earth Day. Hayes found that there was something about the name of the planet that spoke to their bohemian moment. “‘Earth Day’ just rang my chimes,” he said.

Accordingly, many politicians and corporate leaders in the U.S. and beyond have pivoted from framing climate action as a moral or collectivist imperative to an economic one — a matter of capitalizing on technological opportunity. The Council on Foreign Relations has named its latest initiative “Climate Realism,” which could hardly feel further from the utopian “We Are the World” tone of Earth Day.

So in some ways, Sun Day’s messaging seems neatly customized to the current era. McKibben said that he hopes decision makers who were not swayed by campaigns to tax carbon emissions may, under pressure from activists, buy into a framework centered on affordability. Much of the language on the Sun Day website has a plain-spoken pragmatism — “Solar energy is now the cheapest source of power on the planet” — that feels more like an appeal to individual priorities than communal ones.

Still, you can see plenty of the old attitude, too. “We all feel better when the sun comes out, so let’s be the bright light of hope that changes the world,” the website says. On the weekend of Sun Day, in Yellow Springs, Ohio, musicians will play on the porches of solar-powered houses. In Taos, N.M., children will race solar toy cars and construct sun hats. McKibben had originally called for every home with solar panels to shine a green light through a window that night, but nixed this idea after realizing, he said, that most people don’t own green lights.

McKibben and I arrived at a solar array behind an elementary school, surrounded by an untamed field of flowers and stalks. Walking between the rows of panels, he told me that he thinks the time is ripe for the expansion of solar projects like this one, which he wants Sun Day to support. Despite the dominance of the fossil fuel lobby, he sees an opening for common ground. “I think conservatives are very taken with the idea that, ‘Give me some panels and my house really is my castle; I don’t have to depend on anyone for anything,’” he said. “And liberals are all like, ‘It’s networked the groovy power of the sun into a clean grid!’”

But advance reactions to Sun Day suggest that this common ground might not be so easy to locate. Dana R. Fisher, a sociologist who studies climate activism, worries that the whole idea seems “tone deaf, and maybe a little naïve” alongside the G.O.P.’s blows to clean energy. She is doubtful that an event applauding people for purchasing heat pumps will do much: “We don’t really need any more kumbaya at this point,” she said. She wonders if Sun Day will “backfire, because some people are going to celebrate these little individual actions that have no real effect on getting us where we need to go. And everybody else is going to just laugh at these attempts to shine light on these small glimmers of hope in despair.”

These two critiques from opposing directions capture a key tension within the climate movement. The activist, grass-roots side tends to want bold political action and a message that doesn’t sugarcoat or soften the threat of climate change. The other side wants political and economic realism and an end to so-called climate scaremongering. It’s hard not to wonder if catering to everyone is a near-impossible project, one that risks having a constituency of zero.

I asked McKibben if he saw Sun Day as a push for climate activism to align itself with the “abundance” movement’s primary instinct: the idea that the only way forward is building, that the only political path is to create the world that has to replace our own. “I do think we need a new world,” he said. But he is resistant to framing Sun Day in fully economic terms. After all, many in the abundance movement support fossil fuels; some conservatives have glommed on to its message as a way to empower corporations to build whatever they want. Sun Day is partly “pragmatic and about cost,” McKibben said, but it’s also about “beauty and liberation.” When I mentioned that I’d heard criticism of Sun Day as wishfully retrograde, he gave me a resigned smile. “I’m always happy to be called naïve,” he said.

After we visited the solar panels, we stopped for creemees — Vermont’s take on soft serve — and took our cones to go. As we drove through the Green Mountains, McKibben reflected on what the future of this place might hold. “I was very attached to winter,” he said. “The sap in the maple trees would be cracking and swelling, and limbs cracking. You’d hear popping at night.” But “we really haven’t had cold weather in years now.” He looked down at his lap, where a chocolaty puddle was forming on his pants.

In McKibben, you can see climate activists’ particular bind: the dual imperative to provide both real talk and inspiration, the way the grim facts are always fighting with an uplifting, imagined future. When he talks about renewables, he can sound as much like a philosopher-poet as a clean-energy expert. Solar power, he said, is about “bringing our local star down to Earth so we can make use of it.” This kind of rhetoric might be a tonal mismatch for our moment. It might not ignite a broad, popular movement. Then again, no one knows what will.

For all the work McKibben was putting into Sun Day, he’s not sure if it will continue beyond this year. If it does, someone else may have to lead it. “I’m getting old,” he told me. But he’s far from alone in trying to figure out a path for the climate movement. Neubauer told me that young activists have been asking her lately how they can recapture the excitement of the prepandemic student strikes. Instead of trying to get back to 2019, she wants them to think of imitating the years before that. What were activists doing in that time of less momentum — when Trump was elected, and Brexit passed, and wildfires decimated Europe? “We need to fight the cynicism a bit more effectively than we’re doing right now,” Neubauer said.

Prakash, meanwhile, believes that the firsthand experience of extreme weather is what will urge people to political action, the way oppressive pollution did in the lead-up to Earth Day. The question for the climate movement in the next decade, she said, is not just how to limit warming as much as possible but how to help communities recover from natural disasters as they come with greater frequency and ferocity.

She feels encouraged by some new projects, like the Make Polluters Pay campaign, which seeks to sue fossil fuel companies for damages in proportion to their contribution to emissions. She thinks it may be this decade’s version of the divestment campaigns of the 2010s. Prakash sees potential, too, in Sun Day’s economic argument for solar and wind. “I think it’s an interesting experiment,” she said, “in trying to take the fight around renewable energy to a wider audience than just the climate left.”

As McKibben and I wound through the mountain roads in his Kia, dense foliage crowding in on the pavement, he recalled the exact moment when he decided to start planning Sun Day in earnest. Last summer, he watched the solar eclipse from Middlebury’s campus, smack-dab in the path of totality. It had been a while since he’d seen the student body so excited. “It was the biggest event in Vermont in ages,” McKibben said. He stood there on the quad and took it in: hundreds and hundreds of students, craning their faces upward, rapt. “Happily,” McKibben said, “they had a deep affection for the thing we most need to get us out of the jam we’re in.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/21/magazine/21Mag-Climate-Activism-01/21Mag-Climate-Activism-01-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 09:01:24.509187

This environment will provide the Company with a platform to showcase its technology and engage directly with industry stakeholders, media, and consumers.

The Company's participation follows a series of notable validation milestones achieved by Battery X Rebalancing Technologies with its patent-pending, second-generation lithium-ion battery rebalancing software and hardware platform (the ""BATX Rebalancing Machine""). In a recent demonstration, the Company successfully completed a preliminary trial on a real-world, out-of-warranty 96-cell Nissan Leaf battery pack, the second most common out-of-warranty EV model in the United States,3 restoring imbalance-related lost battery capacity through precise cell-level voltage alignment performed by the BATX Rebalancing Machine.

As disclosed in the Company's news releases dated July 4 and July 25, 2025, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies also completed two real-world driving performance trials (each, a ""Trial"" and collectively, the ""Trials"") on fully electric, Class 3 commercial electric vehicles, or light-duty electric vehicles (the ""Electric Trucks""). In the first Trial, the BATX Rebalancing Machine restored a severely degraded battery pack from a reported ~40-kilometer range to an estimated ~295 kilometers range under no-load conditions, representing a ~255-kilometer increase or ~637.5% improvement. In the second Trial, the BATX Rebalancing Machine's integrated diagnostic feature identified a defective cell within a parallel-connected group of battery cells that had caused premature vehicle shutdown below ~60% state of charge (SOC). This enabled targeted cell replacement and subsequent battery rebalancing, restoring the Electric Truck's Effective Driving Range (as defined in the Company's news release dated July 25, 2025) from ~40 kilometers to an estimated ~265 kilometers under no-load conditions, representing a ~225-kilometer increase, or ~ 563% improvement from the Effective Driving Range.

In addition, as disclosed in the Company's July 18, 2025 news release, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies recently entered into a commercial revenue share agreement with an independent Vancouver-based automotive service center specializing in out-of-warranty Tesla vehicles - marking the first commercial deployment of the BATX Rebalancing Machine in a live customer-facing environment. Under the terms of the agreement, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies will receive 20% of gross service revenue per rebalancing procedure, plus applicable taxes, with no direct costs incurred for labor, overhead, or shop operations. This structure is expected to enable Battery X Rebalancing Technologies to monetize the BATX Rebalancing Machine by generating near-term revenue while continuing to advance product validation, refine software architecture, expand compatibility across additional EV platforms, and develop standardized operating procedures in preparation for scaled commercial rollout.

Collectively, the Trials and commercial developments demonstrate BATX Rebalancing Machine's ability to restore degraded battery capacity, extend remaining useful lifespan, and address diagnose cell-level defects across EV battery packs - without resorting to costly full battery pack replacements. By delivering battery rebalancing and diagnostics across multiple EV battery chemistries and configurations, the Company is positioned to address the growing need for scalable, cost-effective battery lifespan extension and recovery solutions as nearly 40 million electric, plug-in hybrid, and hybrid vehicles worldwide are anticipated to fall outside of their original warranty coverage by 2031.6,7

""Everything Electric Canada provides an exceptional platform to present our technology to a diverse audience of industry leaders, innovators, and the broader EV community,"" said Massimo Bellini Bressi, Chief Executive Officer of Battery X Metals.

The Problem: Rising EV Adoption Presents New Battery Lifecycle Challenges

In 2024, global EV sales reached approximately 17.1 million units, representing a 25% increase from 2023.4 With cumulative global EV sales from 2015 to 2023 totaling an estimated over 40 million units,5 a significant share of the global EV fleet is expected to exit warranty coverage over the coming years. 6,7

By 2031, nearly 40 million electric, plug-in hybrid, and hybrid vehicles worldwide are anticipated to fall outside of their original warranty coverage.6,7 This projection is based on current EV adoption figures and standard industry warranty terms, and underscores a growing risk for EV owners facing battery degradation, reduced capacity, and costly replacement requirements.8 As the global EV fleet continues to expand, the demand for technologies that extend battery life, reduce long-term ownership costs, and support a sustainable transition to electric mobility is increasing.

The Solution: Pioneering Next-Generation Technologies to Support Lithium-Ion Battery Longevity

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' proprietary software and hardware technology aims to address this challenge by extending the lifespan of EV batteries. This innovation is being developed with the aim to enhance the sustainability of electric transportation and the goal to provide EV owners with a more cost-effective, environmentally friendly ownership experience by reducing the need for costly battery replacements.

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing technology, validated by the National Research Council of Canada (""NRC""), focuses on battery cell rebalancing. The NRC validation demonstrated the technology's ability to effectively correct cell imbalances in lithium-ion battery packs, recovering nearly all lost capacity due to cell imbalance. The validation was conducted on battery modules composed of fifteen 72Ah LiFePO₄ cells connected in series. The cells were initially balanced to a uniform state of charge (SOC), with a measured discharge capacity of 71.10Ah. In the validation test, three of the fifteen cells were then artificially imbalanced-one cell was charged to a 20% higher SOC, and two cells were discharged to a 20% lower SOC-resulting in a reduced discharge capacity of 46.24Ah, following rebalancing using Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing technology.

However, the journey ahead is complex, shaped by policy push, technological readiness, and the ability to scale sustainably.

In the hydrogen space, the Indian government’s launch of the National Green Hydrogen Mission marks a decisive pivot towards positioning the country as a global hub for green hydrogen production and exports. With an outlay of Rs. 19,744 crore, the mission targets 5 MMT of annual green hydrogen production capacity by 2030, supported by an ecosystem of electrolyzer manufacturing, renewable energy integration, and demand creation across sectors like refining, fertilisers, steel, and mobility. This aggressive ambition is underpinned by India’s advantage of low-cost renewable power, but scaling green hydrogen remains capital-intensive and infrastructure-deficient. Electrolyzer technology is still largely imported, and the sector lacks robust off-take agreements or guaranteed demand to de-risk early investments. Furthermore, the absence of a clear certification system for green hydrogen creates uncertainty for international trade and emissions accounting.

As of March 2025, over 200 MW of green hydrogen production capacity is under development, and domestic electrolyzer manufacturing has picked up momentum with over 8 GW of annual capacity announced by major players such as Reliance Industries, Adani New Industries, and L&T. These developments come alongside international tie-ups, including hydrogen corridor collaborations with the European Union and Japan, as India positions itself as a future exporter of green hydrogen and ammonia.

Simultaneously, biofuels—especially ethanol and compressed biogas (CBG)—have gained momentum as near-term solutions to decarbonize transport and agriculture-linked emissions. The Ethanol Blending Programme has achieved a major milestone with a 12 per cent blending rate in petrol by 2024, moving toward the 20 per cent target by 2025. This expansion has catalyzed investment in second-generation ethanol plants, using agri-residues and municipal waste to reduce reliance on food crops. However, feedstock volatility, pricing challenges, and infrastructure gaps in distribution continue to hinder the sector’s scalability.

Despite these hurdles, the broader clean fuels ecosystem in India is beginning to attract global strategic interest and private capital. Several Indian conglomerates are announcing giga-scale hydrogen and bioenergy projects, often tied to export aspirations. Yet, unless complemented by aggressive domestic demand creation, supportive market mechanisms, and a transparent carbon pricing system, these sectors risk becoming technology showcases rather than transformative industries.

Strategic initiatives gaining momentum

As of early 2025, India’s hydrogen and biofuels sectors are witnessing accelerated activity driven by policy momentum, international collaboration, and private sector investment. One of the most significant developments is the implementation phase of the National Green Hydrogen Mission. The government has initiated pilot projects and disbursed incentives under the Strategic Interventions for Green Hydrogen Transition (SIGHT) scheme to support domestic manufacturing of electrolyzers and green hydrogen production. Leading Indian energy companies such as Reliance Industries, Adani New Industries, and Indian Oil Corporation have announced gigawatt-scale green hydrogen plants in Gujarat and Rajasthan, with timelines aligned to begin phased operations by 2026.

India’s renewable energy advantage continues to be a fundamental enabler. Solar tariffs averaging Rs. 2.4/kWh and favorable land policies in states like Gujarat and Rajasthan have made co-located renewable-hydrogen facilities increasingly viable. Pilot hydrogen projects in refining and fertilizers are underway, with Indian Oil Corporation launching a 10 TPD green hydrogen facility at its Panipat refinery and NTPC exploring hydrogen blending in gas pipelines. The government is expected to roll out green hydrogen consumption mandates in fertilizers and refining by the end of 2025, a key step in securing demand certainty for producers.

In parallel, India signed strategic hydrogen cooperation agreements with countries such as Germany, Japan, and the UAE, laying the foundation for green hydrogen and ammonia exports. These agreements include provisions for co-development of hydrogen corridors, technology transfer, and carbon certification standards. Notably, a new policy on green hydrogen bunkering and port infrastructure was introduced to facilitate maritime transport of hydrogen derivatives, targeting early movers in green shipping and fertilizers.

Simultaneously, the biofuels segment has sustained its upward trajectory. India achieved a 12.5 per cent ethanol blending rate by early 2025 and remains on track to meet its E20 target by mid-year. Ethanol production crossed 5.8 billion liters in FY24–25, up from 4.7 billion liters the previous year. Second-generation ethanol plants have begun operations in Panipat, Bargarh, and Bathinda, using agricultural residue as feedstock and significantly reducing lifecycle emissions. Meanwhile, compressed biogas (CBG) has received a fresh boost under the SATAT scheme, with 370 CBG plants commissioned and an additional 500 in the pipeline. India now produces nearly 1,000 tonnes of CBG per day, although logistical and pricing challenges persist.

Strong policy push

On the policy front, the 2025 Union Budget allocated Rs. 3,000 crore for green fuel infrastructure, including hydrogen storage, pipeline feasibility studies, and biomass aggregation hubs. The government also launched the Bioenergy Alliance of India, aimed at improving coordination between agriculture, energy, and environment ministries to streamline biofuel project implementation. Private capital is increasingly flowing into the space, with bio-CNG startups and hydrogen tech companies attracting over $600 million in venture and strategic funding in the past year.

India achieved a 12 per cent ethanol blending rate in petrol and is on track to meet its E20 target by 2025. This has spurred investment in second-generation ethanol plants using agricultural residue, with facilities by HPCL and IOCL going live in Haryana and Bargarh, Odisha. Additionally, the government launched a National Biomass Supply Chain Alliance to improve logistics and aggregation of feedstock for bioethanol and compressed biogas production. Furthermore, India introduced a Bioenergy Policy Framework to streamline coordination between ministries and provide a long-term roadmap until 2040, addressing regulatory overlaps and investor concerns. The policy prioritizes scaling CBG, biodiesel, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), with incentives for advanced biofuel technologies. International companies and domestic startups alike are entering into joint ventures and licensing deals to localize production of sustainable fuels.

Despite these gains, the sector continues to face challenges such as cost parity with fossil fuels, inadequate infrastructure, and the need for clearer certification and carbon accounting frameworks. However, with green hydrogen production costs falling toward the $2/kg mark and growing international demand for sustainable fuels, India is now firmly positioned to lead in the global clean energy transition. If the current trajectory continues, the hydrogen and biofuels sectors could contribute over 10 per cent to India’s energy mix by 2030, transforming the country’s energy security and emissions landscape.

Challenges galore

The Indian hydrogen and biofuels sectors, despite their growing strategic importance and policy backing, face several systemic and operational challenges that could impede their scale-up and long-term viability. In the hydrogen space, the biggest hurdle lies in the high cost of green hydrogen production, primarily driven by the capital-intensive nature of electrolyzers and the intermittency of renewable energy sources. Although India has access to low-cost solar and wind power, integrating these with electrolyzer systems at industrial scale requires significant grid upgrades and storage infrastructure, which are currently underdeveloped. Furthermore, the absence of a domestic electrolyzer manufacturing base makes the sector heavily reliant on imports, exposing it to global price and supply risks.

Another major challenge is the lack of a robust demand-side framework. While supply incentives have been announced under the SIGHT program, there is limited clarity on long-term offtake agreements, carbon pricing mechanisms, or green hydrogen mandates across key consuming sectors such as steel, cement, and fertilizers. Without clear end-use obligations or incentives for industries to transition from grey to green hydrogen, market creation remains weak. Additionally, India lacks a formal certification system for green hydrogen, which is crucial for ensuring product traceability and enabling international trade, especially with regions like the EU that have strict carbon footprint standards.

In the biofuels sector, feedstock availability and supply chain fragmentation pose ongoing difficulties. The production of ethanol, especially second-generation ethanol from agri-residues, depends heavily on consistent and scalable biomass availability. However, logistics for collection, transportation, and storage of feedstock remain inefficient, particularly in rural areas. The pricing structure of feedstock is often volatile and lacks transparency, affecting the financial viability of projects. For compressed biogas, slow offtake by oil marketing companies, delayed payments, and unviable procurement prices continue to deter large-scale private participation.

The policy and regulatory ecosystem, while ambitious, also suffers from gaps. There is limited coordination between central and state agencies, and biofuels in particular are subject to a fragmented policy landscape with multiple authorities overseeing agriculture, environment, and energy. This often results in delays in approvals and regulatory uncertainty for investors. Moreover, both sectors face skill shortages in advanced technologies, engineering, and project management, further slowing down deployment.

While India has set bold targets for green hydrogen and biofuels, access to affordable finance remains a cross-cutting concern. Long gestation periods and high upfront costs deter commercial banks, and while international green finance is becoming more accessible, the absence of standard project risk assessment frameworks continues to limit large-scale capital inflows.

Way forward

The outlook for India’s hydrogen and biofuels sector in 2025 and beyond is cautiously optimistic, shaped by strong policy intent, global decarbonization momentum, and the urgent need for energy security and import substitution. Both sectors are expected to play a pivotal role in India's journey toward achieving its net-zero emissions target by 2070, and in diversifying the country's energy mix with cleaner, domestically produced alternatives.

Green hydrogen is positioned as a game-changer for hard-to-abate sectors such as refining, steel, heavy transport, and fertilizers. With the National Green Hydrogen Mission entering its implementation phase, the next few years will be crucial for moving from pilot projects to commercial-scale production. India’s access to low-cost renewable power gives it a strategic edge, and the emergence of domestic electrolyzer manufacturing is expected to reduce dependence on imports and bring down costs over time. However, for the hydrogen economy to take off, demand-side incentives and clear end-use mandates will be essential. The government's plan to launch hydrogen hubs and industrial corridors integrated with ports could accelerate infrastructure build-out and global export readiness. If supported by carbon pricing mechanisms and international certification standards, India could become a key global exporter of green hydrogen and its derivatives like green ammonia.

In the biofuels segment, the momentum is likely to remain strong, especially with India approaching its E20 ethanol blending target. The sector is set to benefit from increased investments in second-generation bioethanol and the growing adoption of compressed biogas, biodiesel, and emerging fuels like sustainable aviation fuel. The recent focus on creating a structured biomass supply chain, combined with viability gap funding and private-sector engagement, is expected to address some of the scalability constraints faced in the past. International interest in Indian biofuels, particularly for decarbonizing aviation and shipping, may also open up new export markets.",https://www.indianchemicalnews.com/public/uploads/news/2025/09/27366/ICN_logo.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 12:08:09.408780

This included 1,188GWh from wind and 175GWh from utility-scale solar PV systems.

In August, renewable energy sources, comprising PV, wind, hydro, and biomass, accounted for 40% of the National Electricity Market (NEM) generation, while the Wholesale Electricity Market (WEM) achieved a 36% share from renewables.

Despite this, it is worth noting that the NEM hit a record high for the combined utility-scale solar PV and wind share in the electricity mix on 30 August, coming in at 47.2% at 07:50.

For readers unaware, the NEM refers to the wholesale electricity market where generators sell electricity to retailers, who then on-sell it to consumers. It operates on one of the world’s longest interconnected power systems, linking Queensland, New South Wales (including the Australian Capital Territory), Victoria, Tasmania, and South Australia.

Meanwhile, the WEM, which is specific to Western Australia, is the system that governs the trading and supply of electricity in the state’s South West Interconnected System (SWIS). The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) operates both of these.

Dixon also pointed out that in August, there were 554 hours of negative prices across the NEM and WEM states. This number is lower than in the comparable periods of August 2024 and August 2023, and the decrease can be attributed in part to higher underlying demand and increased charging from battery energy storage systems (BESS) and pumped hydro energy storage (PHES) systems.

Negative pricing typically arises when solar PV generation peaks, creating a surplus of energy in the middle of the day. Due to Australia’s strong solar PV capacity, Tim Buckley, founder and director of the think tank Climate Energy Finance, has dubbed the country a “world leader in negative pricing in wholesale markets.”

Data from AEMO earlier this year revealed that during the fourth quarter of 2024, negative price events occurred in 23.1% of instances across the NEM.

City of Helena launches electric vehicle pilot program

The city commission has appropriated $60,000 from the general fund cash reserves for the project.

Currently, the city has two first-generation electric vehicles: an electric car and an electric street sweeper.

The pros of the pilot vehicle are that its charge should last for around a week of driving, and “it has the ability to plug tools into it, so we potentially won't have to use generators and things like that,” said Anderson.

The project also tests out the ability of various facilities to accommodate charging of the vehicle, and whether it can stand Montana’s bitter winter, a big concern.

Anderson says they wonder, “How the cold weather affects it, if it is reduced by half, or what its capacity is.”

Over in East Helena, they are wrapping up an electric vehicle test of their own with a school bus.

Dan Rispens, the East Helena superintendent, says, “It is a little bit of an experiment for us just to try out the technology; it is new and different than what we are used to.”

It faces the winter just fine, though they did notice it does not go as far on a charge.

Rispens says electric buses across the state, ""noticed a bit of a diminished range in the colder weather, but really no major issues.”

The company will be cutting between 20 and 25 percent of its staff, including both employees and contractors, a spokesperson told Newsweek.

ConocoPhillips had around 12,000 employees at the end of last year according to its own estimates, and currently employs a total of roughly 13,000 globally, according to Reuters, meaning as many as 3,250 roles could be impacted by the decision.

""As we streamline our organization and take work out of the system, we will need fewer roles,"" CEO Ryan Lance said in a video message to employees and heard by Reuters.

Why It Matters

ConocoPhillips is one of the largest oil and gas companies in the U.S, behind only Exxon Mobil and Chevron in terms of market capitalization. Its announcement follows similar plans being revealed by other major energy firms, despite the policy wins the sector has racked up during President Donald Trump's second term, and comes as oil prices continue their downward trend in 2025 and domestic drilling itself stalls.

What To Know

The layoffs follow the rollout of the company's cost-cutting and restructuring initiative earlier this year. Dubbed ""Competitive Edge,"" Reuters reported that ConocoPhillips had hired management consulting firm Boston Consulting Group to advise on the program, which would involve job cuts and other efforts aimed at improving margins.

Last month, after reporting a decline in earnings for the second quarter, the company said it had identified ""cost reductions and margin enhancements"" that could save it around $1 billion by the end of 2026.

According to Reuters, as well as the broader efficiency push, the company's CEO cited escalating expenses as a key factor behind the decision to cut jobs.

A number of companies have announced similar plans this year amid an ongoing decline in oil prices and crude oil futures.

In January, British oil giant BP revealed plans to cut more than five percent of its total workforce. In August, the company revised these figures upward, announcing that around 6,200 corporate positions, or 15 percent of its office-based staff, would be cut.

In February, Houston-based Chevron said it would be trimming its global workforce by 15 to 20 percent, a change Vice Chairman Mark Nelson said would ""improve standardization, centralization, efficiency and results,"" Forbes reported.

What People Are Saying

ConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance, following the company's second quarter results, said: ""We are leveraging our scale and technologies to drive a further $1 billion-plus in companywide cost reductions and margin enhancements by the end of 2026. These efforts strengthen our free cash flow generation, enabling us to continue delivering strong returns on and of capital.""

A spokesperson for ConocoPhillips told Newsweek: ""We are always looking at how we can be more efficient with the resources we have. As part of this process, we have informed employees that a 20 percent to 25 percent reduction in our global workforce, which includes employees and contractors, is anticipated.""

What Happens Next?

ConocoPhillips told Newsweek that it expects the ""majority of these reductions"" to occur before the end of 2025.

Energy is just one of several sectors in the U.S. facing job cuts, layoffs and hiring freezes this year. The weaknesses seen in oil and gas will factor into the broader labor market outlook, already a cause for concern following recent reports from various government agencies and research organizations.

Musk would also receive more voting power over Tesla under the proposed plan.
A condition of the 11th and 12th tranches of the plan includes Musk coming up with a framework for someone to succeed him as CEO.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk could be in line for a payout of $1 trillion if his electric car company meets a series of extremely aggressive targets over the next 10 years, according to documents released by the company.

Tesla, which is leaning heavily into robotics and AI, said in a regulatory filing on Friday that the package has a dozen share tranches that include awards for Musk if targets, ranging from car production to the total value of the company, are met over that time period.

Very early in the plan, Tesla would have to reach a market valuation of $2 trillion and achieve 20 million vehicles deliveries. Tesla delivered less than 2 million vehicles in 2024.

That milestone would also required a million robotaxis in commercial operation and the delivery of 1 million artificial intelligence bots.

Musk needs to remain with Tesla for at least seven and a half years to cash out on any stock, and 10 years to earn the full amount.

Musk would also receive more voting power over Tesla under the proposed plan. The EV company is set to hold its annual shareholders meeting on Nov. 6. Tesla’s last shareholders meeting was on June 13 of last year, where investors voted to restore Musk’s record $44.9 billion pay package that was thrown out by a Delaware judge earlier that year.

Some of the fastest-growing jobs will be found in technology, data, and AI, the WEF’s report states.
Demand for advanced AI skills like generative modeling and data annotation is rising fast — along with freelancer earnings in these areas.
“Our research suggests companies aren’t necessarily transitioning workers into tech roles, but rather enabling people to augment their roles with AI,” said Gabby Burlacu, senior research manager for the URI.
AI will boost demand for tech roles while displacing repetitive jobs, according to Raj Namboothiry, SVP & head of North America at ManpowerGroup.","The rise of AI and clean energy technologies is set to reshape the American workforce, with major job growth projected in tech and energy-related industries, according to a new report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).

AI-fueled demand for software development, data processing, and cybersecurity is expected to boost employment in professional and technical services by 7.5% and in the information sector by 6.5% over the next decade, according to the BLS report.

By 2030, a projected global labor shortage of up to 50 million workers will leave jobs unfilled, and 59% of employees will need significant reskilling as 78 million new jobs will emerge, demanding skills we’re only beginning to define, according to the World Economic Forum (WEF). Some of the fastest-growing jobs will be found in technology, data, and AI, the WEF’s report states.

There has been a 40% month-over-month increase in demand for AI/ML skills among small-and-medium-sized businesses, with client spend on AI work up 30% year-over-year and 51% more for prompt engineering, according to a new report from freelance marketplace provider Upwork.

The most in-demand skills include those that involve human-AI collaboration, such as fact-checking and video editing, according to the report. At the same time, Upwork is seeing a significant rise in demand for roles like career coaching and training & development.

“This reflects businesses’ growing need for adaptability and guidance, highlighting how centric roles are essential to complement advanced AI capabilities in a fast-changing work landscape,” Teng Liu, economist for the Upwork Research Institute (URI), said in an email reply to Computerworld.

Even in a softer job market, one in four business leaders turned to freelancers in August to access specialized skills and fill talent gaps, Liu said.

Demand for advanced AI skills like generative modeling and data annotation is rising fast — along with freelancer earnings in these areas. At the same time, roles like career coaching and training are also seeing strong growth, showing that human-centric skills remain essential alongside AI, he said.

“Our research suggests companies aren’t necessarily transitioning workers into tech roles, but rather enabling people to augment their roles with AI,” said Gabby Burlacu, senior research manager for the URI.

“It’s not that the need for skilled humans performing this work is disappearing; it’s that the roles themselves are evolving, incorporating a greater technology component than they have in the past,” she added. “That’s a key nuance to the discussion of growing and shrinking jobs in an AI world: Certain jobs as we know them may be automated, but that does not actually eliminate the need for a skilled person performing them differently and alongside AI.”

Spend on AI prompt engineering is up 52% year-over-year, and demand is growing for skills like generative AI modeling and AI agent design, according to Upwork. New roles like Chief AI Officer are emerging, but the bigger shift is how AI now touches everything — from writing and design to project management and finance. It’s becoming a general-purpose technology transforming how all work gets done.

For example, in a post-ChatGPT world, Upwork’s research still found that 15% of the jobs posted on its site come from new demand for content creators, but those jobs now require twice as many AI skills, Burlacu said.

At the same time, the push toward electrification — driven by AI, electric vehicles, and data centers — is powering a surge in renewable energy jobs. Solar, wind, geothermal, and tidal energy industries top the list of fastest-growing sectors, projected to add over 41,000 jobs, while battery and electrical component manufacturing will add nearly 48,400 positions, according to BLS data.

However, automation and AI are also expected to lead to significant job declines in office, sales, and production roles. Overall AI and mathematical occupations, led by data scientists and cybersecurity analysts, are forecast to grow over 10%, more than triple the national average, the BLS’s report showed.

Yet, only 10% of CIOs and senior tech leaders say AI is fully integrated across their organization, leaving a lot of room for adoption growth, according to a study by staffing firm ManpowerGroup.

AI will boost demand for tech roles while displacing repetitive jobs, according to Raj Namboothiry, SVP & head of North America at ManpowerGroup.

To prepare for these disruptions, job seekers should focus on developing “adjacent skills” to AI, such as data analysis and critical thinking, to leverage AI rather than compete with it, while companies should invest in upskilling and reskilling their existing workforce to adapt to new technologies, he said.

“Strengthen your critical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity, as these are uniquely human abilities that AI cannot replicate,” Namboothiry said. “And focus on roles that require human-centric skills like ethical considerations — bioethics, AI governance.”

AI’s impact on jobs will be multifaceted and deep, according to Namboothiry:

Growth: Rising demand for roles in IT, data science, and AI integration.

Decline: Job losses in routine-heavy fields like sales, production, and admin.

Productivity: AI boosts efficiency in tasks like data entry and logistics.

The next generation of IT workers must become “super workers” with the ability to use AI as a tool to enhance their productivity and effectiveness, rather than being replaced by it.

A ManpowerGroup study and survey revealed that one-third of employers believe AI cannot replace or augment critical human skills such as:",https://www.computerworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/4051732-0-81457500-1757070171-AI_and_green_energy_jobs_shutterstock_2674248933.jpg?quality=50&strip=all&w=1024,N,,2025-09-05 09:00:30.893915

Until January, we had a strong partner in the federal government, and Colorado received hundreds of millions of dollars in clean energy and climate-related projects from the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.
Those are real lives saved by the kind of clean energy policies Evans just voted to dismantle.
No matter the individual health choices they make, they bear the burden, or will reap the benefits, of the choices we make together.
Clean energy is preventive medicine.","Colorado is one of the healthiest states in the country, but health isn’t determined by lifestyle choices alone. Our well-being is deeply influenced by the air we breathe, the water we drink and the environment we live in.

Too many Coloradans suffer the health impacts of pollution that are outside their control, especially children with asthma, seniors with respiratory issues and low-income communities near highways and industrial polluters. Despite this reality, U.S. Rep. Gabe Evans voted for a federal spending bill that cuts critical investments proven to reduce pollution and protect public health.

As a physician, I see these impacts up close in my patients every day. Poor air quality affects my patients even before they are born, impacting fetal lung development and resulting in an increase in premature births. When air quality is poor, I know that there will be more children in my clinic struggling to breathe from asthma. And despite living in beautiful Colorado, I have to tell kids it is not safe to play outside. We have a responsibility, as a community and a state, to make choices that create a clean and healthy environment for everyone.

The science is clear: The dirty fossil fuels we burn release pollutants and greenhouse gases that are endangering our health, especially in frontline communities living along highway corridors and around oil and gas operations, refineries and other polluting industries. According to the American Lung Association’s State of the Air report, 80% of Coloradans live in communities with unhealthy air.

Air pollution is one of the most dangerous threats to public health, more than high blood pressure, smoking or diabetes. It’s strongly linked to heart attacks, strokes, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, adverse pregnancy outcomes and even dementia.

Over the past 20 years, Colorado has led the way in reducing emissions and cleaning up our air. We’ve closed coal plants, expanded wind and solar energy, regulated methane emissions and been among the top states in the adoption of electric vehicles. We’ve installed electric vehicle chargers, bought electric school buses and strengthened building efficiency standards. These steps aren’t just good for the planet — they’re good for our lungs, our hearts and our families.

Until January, we had a strong partner in the federal government, and Colorado received hundreds of millions of dollars in clean energy and climate-related projects from the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

Now, Congress has passed a spending bill that not only eliminates the clean energy investments protecting our health, but takes away health care from the communities most impacted by higher levels of pollution. Evans helped make that happen. He had the chance to stand up for his constituents’ health; instead, he voted for legislation that puts Colorado communities at greater risk of pollution, illness and economic instability.

This summer, as ozone season worsens and more Coloradans are warned to stay inside, it’s important to remember that by cleaning up our air and cutting pollution, we make our communities healthier. One study predicted that national IRA investments in greenhouse gas reduction could, by 2050, prevent nearly 1 million asthma attacks, 41,000 heart attacks and 19,000 hospital admissions — a total of more than 3 million lost workdays and 33,000 deaths. Those are real lives saved by the kind of clean energy policies Evans just voted to dismantle.

Every Coloradan will benefit from cleaner, healthier energy. But let’s especially remember those disproportionately affected: children, pregnant individuals, the elderly, those with chronic illnesses, communities of color, people in historically redlined neighborhoods, and communities near highways, power plants or industrial facilities. No matter the individual health choices they make, they bear the burden, or will reap the benefits, of the choices we make together.

Clean energy is preventive medicine. Let’s prescribe more of it — and demand that our leaders prioritize it, too.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-80/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/dsc_0545-1024x6831757065070.jpeg?h=199d8c1f&itok=OafIfqjv,N,,2025-09-05 12:12:10.753104

In the near term, secondary supplies of uranium will continue to play a role in bridging the gap between supply and demand.
Secondary supply refers to uranium obtained from sources other than newly mined ore, primarily from existing stockpiles and recycled materials.
Kazakhstan is the world’s leading uranium producer, responsible for over 40% of global production, with significant reserves.
US president Donald Trump said earlier this year he would fast-track uranium projects under an emergency declaration to restore US energy independence.","A nuclear energy renaissance could create a shortfall in the supply of uranium with output from today’s mines expected to halve between 2030 and 2040 as existing deposits are exhausted.

According to a report from the London-based World Nuclear Association on 5 September, the growing interest in deploying nuclear plants to meet climate targets and for energy security has led to significant increases in projections for future nuclear capacity, and demand for nuclear fuel cycle services.

Global uranium requirements for reactors could rise by a third to 86,000 tonnes by 2030, and to 150,000 tonnes by 2040, according to the report.

But output from today’s mines is expected to halve between 2030 and 2040 as existing deposits are exhausted, leaving a “significant gap” that threatens the nuclear power revival.

The report called on the industry to secure investment to locate more uranium and extract it from current as well as new and idle mines to avoid a supply crunch.

“Geopolitical instability, notably resulting from the Russia-Ukraine war, has also led to increased interest in nuclear power for energy security and sovereignty,” the report said.

“The same instability has had significant implications for the globalised market for nuclear fuel cycle services, with utilities, suppliers and governments in North America and Europe pursuing opportunities to diversify supplies.”

The report said primary production of uranium from mines, conversion plants and enrichment plants, continues to supply most demand for nuclear reactors around the globe.

In the near term, secondary supplies of uranium will continue to play a role in bridging the gap between supply and demand.

Diminishing Role Of Secondary Supplies

However, secondary supply is projected to have a gradually diminishing role in the world market, decreasing from the current level in supplying 11-14% of reactor uranium requirements to 4-11% in 2050.

Secondary supply refers to uranium obtained from sources other than newly mined ore, primarily from existing stockpiles and recycled materials.

Earlier this week Canadian uranium supplier Cameco said development delays at its McArthur River mine in Saskatchewan to new mining areas are expected to impact its 2025 production forecast, further adding to pressure n supply.

The Cameco announcement came days after Kazatomprom, Kazakhstan’s state-owned uranium producer, reported plans to lower output in 2026, saying that despite firm long-term prices, market conditions do not support a return to full capacity.

In a corporate update, the company said its production will be about 10% lower compared to earlier targets, dropping from 32,777 tonnes of U3O8 to 29,697 tonnes.

Kazakhstan is the world’s leading uranium producer, responsible for over 40% of global production, with significant reserves.

A recent Consumer Price Index report found electricity prices were rising at double the rate of inflation, having increased 5.5 percent over the past year.
THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!” While on the campaign trail, Trump promised to bring down electricity prices.
“Residential retail electricity prices are set with basically a lag,” Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Christopher Knittel recently told The Hill.
However, Knittel said blue-state policies that require a transition to renewable energy may also be contributing to the problem.","Rising power prices are becoming a political liability for Republicans as electricity costs outpace inflation.

A recent Consumer Price Index report found electricity prices were rising at double the rate of inflation, having increased 5.5 percent over the past year.

And the general public may be starting to take notice.

“In the last couple of years, different items that have gone up in price have become media concerns. They become very visible, people get very angry — and I think electric rates are heading in that direction,” said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors’ Association.

Wolfe said that if rates continue to rise, “it’ll become a political issue.”

The Trump administration is already seeing it as one — and trying to put the blame on Democrats and renewable energy.

“That is a key challenge for us,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright told Fox Business Network’s “Mornings with Maria” when asked about utility bills this week.

“Things move slowly in the electricity grid. All sorts of crazy projects were under construction and being built on your electricity grids over the last four years,” he said.

Wright, in a recent interview with Politico, similarly blamed “the momentum of the Obama-Biden policies.”

However, he lamented, “We’re going to get blamed, because we’re in office.”

President Trump has taken a similar tack, blaming renewables even though a greater supply of renewable power would actually be expected to bring costs down.

On Truth Social this week, he decried “ridiculous, corrupt politician approved ‘’windmills.’”

He also previously posted, “Any State that has built and relied on WINDMILLS and SOLAR for power are seeing RECORD BREAKING INCREASES IN ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY COSTS. THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!”

While on the campaign trail, Trump promised to bring down electricity prices.

“Under my leadership, the United States will commit to the ambitious goal of slashing energy and electricity prices by half, at least,” he said at a rally last year. “We intend to slash prices by half within 12 months, at a maximum 18 months.”

Democrats are beginning to weaponize the issue against Republicans, especially after they repealed subsidies for wind and solar energy.

“The big, ugly bill is going to mean a lot of big, ugly energy bills arriving in the mail for Americans around the country,” Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) said last month.

Experts say a buildout of renewables would help bring down prices, but the impacts of Trump’s moves are not being felt yet.

“Residential retail electricity prices are set with basically a lag,” Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Christopher Knittel recently told The Hill. “Trump’s effects on the rate changes won’t take place until after the midterms.”

But they also note some of this administration’s policies, including those that attack renewable energy, are expected to exacerbate the issue in the future.

“It’s less power capacity being built, and then that means that there’s gonna be less supply of power and the same demand, so prices will be higher,” Thomas Rowlands-Rees, head of North America Research at BloombergNEF, said when asked about the repeal of renewable energy tax credits.

However, Knittel said blue-state policies that require a transition to renewable energy may also be contributing to the problem.

“Renewable policies in some of the blue states have put upward pressure on prices,” he said.

“Renewable portfolio standards that have forced or incentivized or regulated adoption of more renewables, partly with the idea that the Inflation Reduction Act would provide some financial support for that, and now that’s gone, or will be gone — that’s going to put upward pressure on prices,” Knittel said, noting the combination of the Democrat standards and Republican subsidy repeal are both contributing to this issue.

Meanwhile, Rowlands-Rees noted the Trump administration’s push to export more liquified natural gas (LNG) may also raise consumer electric prices.

“If the U.S. is increasing its ability to export that gas as LNG, where the exporters will make a much bigger profit than selling it locally in the U.S., then a lot of that gas will then go abroad, and so the more capability the U.S. has to export its gas, the higher gas prices will be in the U.S., for U.S. citizens,” he said.

“There’s such a huge contrast between the global price of gas and the domestic U.S. price of gas … and the only reason the two aren’t the same is because of this limited ability to export,” he added. “The U.S. is in this little bubble of cheap gas, and so the more that bubble is burst by pro-LNG export policies, the more … U.S. gas prices start to look like the rest of the world.”

U.S. electricity primarily comes from gas, coal, renewable and nuclear energy.

Another major driver of price increases is the buildout of data centers, as AI and other technologies are particularly power-hungry. If these centers don’t come with their own power source, they may just use whatever’s on the grid, driving up demand.

“There is this upward pressure because of data centers,” Rowlands-Rees said.

Both Democrats and Republicans have been at least somewhat supportive of boosting construction of data centers, though the Trump administration has particularly put forward plans to fast track them.

But Knittel said that’s just one factor contributing to the higher prices seen today.

“You also have climate change that is increasing wildfire risks,” he said. “That’s putting upward pressure on prices … on the West Coast.”

Meanwhile, Wolfe, with the National Energy Assistance Directors’ Association, also expressed concerns about the Trump administration’s efforts to slash a financial assistance program that helps low-income Americans afford to heat and cool their homes.

While this program has historically had bipartisan support and is likely to get money from Congress, the Trump administration has proposed defunding it.

“Even if Congress goes ahead and gives … funding, [it] doesn’t mean they’re going to spend it,” Wolfe said. “If you don’t have access to appropriate cooling and heating, you can die.”",https://www.abc27.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2025/09/trump_donald_02142025_GettyImages-2198926783.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-06 20:01:46.476291

These contrasting policies are not only redefining domestic energy landscapes but also reshaping global markets, creating both opportunities and risks for investors. Strategic asset allocation in renewable energy and fossil fuels must now account for this geopolitical and technological realignment.

The U.S. Path: Innovation and Policy Uncertainty

The U.S. clean energy strategy, anchored by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), emphasizes domestic manufacturing and technological leadership. Since 2022, quarterly clean energy manufacturing investment has surged from $2.5 billion to $14.0 billion in Q1 2025, driven by tax credits for electric vehicles (EVs), batteries, and solar modules [1]. The IRA’s Section 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credit has directly subsidized U.S.-based production, incentivizing firms to localize supply chains [1].

However, this momentum faces headwinds. Tariff escalations and macroeconomic pressures have led to project cancellations, with $6.9 billion in investments withdrawn in Q1 2025 alone [1]. Additionally, the U.S. lags in renewable energy deployment compared to China, generating 22% of its electricity from renewables versus China’s 31% [1]. While the U.S. leads in nuclear power and offshore wind, its reliance on private-sector investment creates policy uncertainty, particularly after the Trump administration’s rollbacks of environmental regulations [3].

China’s Strategy: State-Driven Dominance and Global Export

China’s approach is characterized by aggressive state planning and industrial overcapacity. By 2024, it had added 1,400 gigawatts of solar and wind capacity—six years ahead of its 2030 target—enabling renewables to meet 80% of new electricity demand [3]. Despite this, coal still accounts for 54.8% of its electricity mix, highlighting the need for more aggressive decarbonization [3].

Globally, China’s dominance in clean-tech manufacturing is unparalleled. It controls over 70% of global production for solar modules, batteries, and wind turbines [5], with exports in 2024 alone avoiding 1% of global CO2 emissions outside its borders [1]. These exports, particularly to South Asia and the Middle East, are reshaping energy transitions in developing economies, where Chinese technology’s low cost and high efficiency are critical [1]. However, this dominance has triggered trade tensions, with the EU, U.S., and Canada imposing tariffs or import bans on Chinese EVs [2].

Global Market Implications and Strategic Asset Allocation

The U.S.-China divergence is creating a bifurcated global energy market. For investors, this necessitates a nuanced approach to asset allocation:

Renewables in the U.S.: The IRA’s tax credits (e.g., ITC and PTC extensions) make U.S. renewables attractive, particularly for firms with expertise in offshore wind, nuclear, and AI-driven grid optimization [5]. However, risks include policy reversals and supply chain bottlenecks.

China’s Export-Driven Renewables: Chinese solar and battery manufacturers offer high returns due to economies of scale and global demand. Yet, trade barriers and geopolitical tensions could disrupt margins.

Fossil Fuels: Coal remains a drag on decarbonization, particularly in China. Investors should avoid coal-heavy assets in both countries, as policy shifts and market dynamics favor renewables.

Emerging Markets: Developing economies are becoming key battlegrounds for clean energy. Chinese exports dominate here, but U.S. partnerships (e.g., through the Clean Power Africa initiative) could diversify opportunities [2].

Conclusion

The U.S. and China are steering the clean energy transition along distinct paths. The U.S. prioritizes innovation and domestic resilience, while China leverages state planning and global exports. For investors, the key lies in balancing exposure to U.S. tech-driven renewables and Chinese manufacturing dominance while hedging against policy and trade risks.

Despite lower gasoline prices at the start of his second term, electricity costs are rising faster than inflation due to a combination of factors, including increased demand for capacity from large data centers and other factors.

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics as of the end of July, electricity prices jumped 5.5% year over year – nearly double the pace of general inflation, which remains high.

Across regions, the cost increases are felt differently: in Maine +26%, in New Jersey +25%, in Wyoming +15%, in Utah +15%, and in Illinois +14% in June, according to the EIA.

The average cost of electricity for households has fallen only in a few states – North Carolina (-1%), Rhode Island (-1%), Idaho (-1%), Hawaii (-4%), and Nevada (-26%).

“Unusually rapid electricity price increases are driven by a combination of factors: rising demand, supply constraints, and infrastructure costs,”

– Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group

Experts also point to the impact of demand growth from data centers and the active deployment of artificial intelligence, which increases overall electricity consumption.

When it comes to energy and policy, questions about infrastructure expenditures and their impact on prices for households remain a central topic of discussion among analysts and policymakers.

From the Model T to SpaceX, and from the Empire State Building to the iPhone, Americans have repeatedly shown an aptitude for developing innovative technologies and building them rapidly and at a high level of quality. Americans’ continued ability to do this has been key to our success.

The latest technological challenge America has taken on involves artificial intelligence (AI). AI promises to spur advances in everything from culture to healthcare. Running AI, however, requires more than just technical creativity and know-how; it requires a huge amount of electricity. AI data centers consume an enormous amount of power. One large data center alone can use more electricity than a medium-sized city.

The projected growth in demand for electricity from AI is so substantial that it has fundamentally reordered the nature of electricity planning. For decades, electricity consumption in America was flat or declining for a number of reasons. Many of our devices became more energy efficient, while energy-intensive industries moved offshore. Now, however, the U.S. electricity market is undergoing a fundamental change. Electric demand is projected to increase by 80 gigawatts by 2030.

The projected increase in electricity demand isn’t, however, all due to data centers. Other sources, from electric vehicles to reindustrialization, also play a role. But regardless of source, America will have to build a lot of new generation to meet all this demand.

America used to build things much faster. In recent decades, however, an increase in rules and regulations involving project permitting has slowed our ability to build infrastructure to a snail’s pace. At the beginning of the 20th century, the first 28 stations of the New York City subway were built in less than five years. By contrast, a three-station expansion of the subway system begun at the turn of the 21st century took 17 years to complete.

It’s the same story when it comes to energy. Transmission lines take an average of seven to 10 years to be built. The bulk of this time comes not from the actual construction but from permitting timelines. Building power plants can also be an ordeal, with supply chain issues and permitting requirements delaying projects for years on end.

If America is going to continue to be a technological powerhouse, it will have to solve its permitting problem. And ironically, AI may not only be one of the causes of our electricity demand growth spurt, but also a critical part of the solution. The U.S. government’s Idaho National Laboratory recently announced that it is partnering with Microsoft to use AI to speed up the permitting process for nuclear power plants. And the Trump administration has set a goal of reducing the time required for permitting nuclear plants from the current decade-long affair that it is to a mere 18 months. AI programs can help with this process by helping to generate application materials and compile safety data necessary for project approvals much more quickly.

Digital automation can help with both the application and approval processes. The Department of Energy has developed an app that local governments can use to quickly review and approve rooftop solar projects. Similar software might soon be used to help regulators resolve applications at record speed.

AI and other computer technologies are not a panacea for permitting delays. Our current system is too cumbersome and creates too many avenues for small numbers of anti-growth ideologues to block needed projects. Still, AI is a way to do permitting quicker and better, which shows that America still has the wherewithal to achieve great things, if only we have the will to do so.",https://www.rstreet.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/AdobeStock_69730102.jpeg,N,,2025-09-05 09:01:07.531500

The group felt fees should still be higher and that the package should be tied to other bills to ensure carbon capture operations aren’t polluting the air themselves.","Michigan bills to let the state permit carbon capture and storage projects passed in the state Senate Thursday.

Carbon sequestration is the process of storing carbon dioxide emissions, often underground, rather than releasing them into the atmosphere. Currently, federal regulators primarily handle the approval process for new projects.

State Senator Sean McCann (D-Kalamazoo) is among the package co-sponsors. He said state regulators could do a better job considering Michigan’s needs for those operations than the federal government.

McCann said carbon capture itself could have an upside for meeting the state’s environmental and carbon neutrality goal.

“We look to a lot of things for how we can reduce our carbon output for energy and industrial uses and so on. And this legislation, should it be successful, will help Michigan reach our climate goals faster,” McCann said Thursday after the bills had passed.

The three bills in the package passed with bipartisan support as well as some no votes from both sides of the aisle.

State Senator Jeff Irwin (D-Ann Arbor) was among the opposition, calling carbon capture “potentially dangerous” and “uncertain.”

Irwin said he supports the state having a larger say in regulating carbon capture, but the bills need to include more of what he calls “best practices.”

“Best practices like requiring, if we’re going to allow carbon capture, that it actually reduce the amount of carbon. If we’re using more carbon, if we’re generating more pollution just to put this other pollution under the ground, that’s a foolish tradeoff and we shouldn’t allow it here in Michigan,” Irwin said.

During the committee process, lawmakers tried to address some concerns environmental groups brought up with the bills.

McCann said the legislation tried to build upon laws passed by other states. That included incorporating relatively high fees for storing carbon dioxide underground and sending money collected from those fees into newly created pots of money like a Community Benefits Fund.

“We’re not the first state, we’re not the first adopter here to do these kinds of projects. We’ve learned from other states as far as how to go about this. We’ve had lots of expert involvement,” McCann said.

Despite the changes, the Michigan Environmental Justice Coalition still shared numerous concerns with the bills. The group felt fees should still be higher and that the package should be tied to other bills to ensure carbon capture operations aren’t polluting the air themselves.

It also took issue with provisions that would have the state potentially assuming liability for projects after 50 years, or sooner in some cases. Chris Gilmer-Hill is the policy associate at the coalition.

“To not only create a long-term liability that has to be monitored that poses a potential community risk, but hand over the cost of that to the public, that’s forcing the public to subsidize long-term pollution,” Gilmer-Hill said.

Amendments to address some of those concerns were shot down ahead of a final vote on the Senate floor Thursday.

Portland General Electric and its partner Mitsubishi Power have quietly shelved a planned hydrogen production, storage and hydrogen-fueled generation complex near Boardman, Oregon.

“Given the exit of an essential project partner in June, along with challenging project economics for utility customers and federal policy changes, PGE is no longer pursuing” the hydrogen complex, PGE spokesman Drew Hanson said via email.

The cancellation comes at a dicey time for the tri-state Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub, the ringleader that is channeling federal money to projects in the region. The U.S. Energy Department is scrutinizing clean energy programs and initiatives launched under the Biden administration, including the Northwest hub. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said he is ready to terminate funding for projects that he deems “a bridge to nowhere.”

Elected officials from across the political spectrum in the Northwest have defended low-emissions hydrogen as a promising means to create new jobs and meet climate goals, particularly in sectors that are proving difficult to convert directly to clean electric power.

“We have several new projects in the pipeline that we’re excited to share more on soon,” spokesperson Kaitlin Sheppherd said in an emailed statement on behalf of the Northwest hydrogen hub. “PNWH2 continues to evaluate additional project interest and remains focused on supporting a broad, resilient regional hydrogen ecosystem with the potential to deliver lasting economic value to Oregon and the greater Pacific Northwest.”

The PGE and Mitsubishi Power pullback follows in the wake of the scrapping of a different hydrogen factory in Centralia, Washington, proposed by Fortescue, which was to be one of the primary producers of the alternative fuel within the regional clean energy hub. Another founding partner in the PNWH2 Hub, Seattle-based developer of hydrogen-powered mining trucks First Mode, declared bankruptcy last December.

PGE’s pivot calls into question what will happen at the nearby Port of Morrow, where Air Liquide planned to build a hydrogen liquefaction plant to support distribution of clean hydrogen to urban fueling stations and the ports of Seattle and Tacoma. PGE and Mitsubishi were supposed to supply the gaseous hydrogen to Air Liquide via a short pipeline from the site of PGE’s demolished coal power plant outside Boardman.

Air Liquide acknowledged a request for comment, but a spokesperson declined to shed more light about where things are headed now.

The Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub said in its emailed statement that “project adjustments were expected and planned for” in the early development phase of the nascent industry. The pullback in this region tracks with what is happening elsewhere.

Brand name corporations — such as Shell, BP and Airbus — and lesser-known startups around the world are scaling back their hydrogen ambitions. Commonly cited reasons include a slower-than-anticipated emergence of customer demand and stubbornly high costs to produce green hydrogen.

The developers behind the two remaining large-scale projects in the Northwest hydrogen hub are pressing ahead. Switzerland-based Atlas Agro plans to build a $1.5 billion green fertilizer factory near Richland, Washington, for which hydrogen produced on site will be a key ingredient. Meanwhile, Calgary-based AltaGas has a costly plan to redevelop the closed Alcoa aluminum smelter near Ferndale, Washington, to produce climate-friendly hydrogen for refinery use, transportation fuel and possibly power generation.

Crucially, Atlas Agro and AltaGas need to secure large volumes of affordable renewable electricity for the energy-intensive process of making hydrogen. The green fertilizer plant reportedly needs around 300 megawatts of power, which is a bigger load than all of the rest of Richland combined.

AltaGas estimated last year that it needs about 265 megawatts of electricity to achieve its maximum production target at Ferndale. Neither company has confirmed they have a power supply contract amid rising competition for sources of renewable electricity.

“The success of this project is contingent on regulatory and financial incentive certainty, timely approvals, and a clear and predictable path forward from government and commercial partners,” said Andrea McNamara Doyle, Washington state external affairs manager for AltaGas, in an emailed statement.

The Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub game plan envisions that producers will make “green” hydrogen exclusively by splitting water molecules with an electric current. This process (known as electrolysis) must use renewable electricity for the resulting hydrogen to be considered green.

Hydrogen sector dependent on uncertain government support

A year ago, the Pacific NW hub collected the first installment from its potentially $1 billion federal allocation. That $27.5 million in initial funding through the Energy Department partially passed through to participating companies and to Washington State University to begin site planning and community outreach.

Under the original program terms, another tranche of funding would come 12-18 months after the first to subsidize developer permitting and engineering. A third tranche could underwrite the construction phase for multiple years, before a possible final shot of money comes to subsidize production ramp up. In all, the hub could pass through federal subsidies to its participants for 8-12 years.

But this past May, Wright, President Donald Trump’s energy secretary, announced a department-wide review of grant programs to root out “wasteful spending of taxpayer dollars.” Wright expressed skepticism about government support to scale up clean hydrogen.

“Hydrogen, it’s tough with the math to see how in the long term it becomes a meaningful commercial energy source,” Wright told senators at a budget hearing in front of the Senate Energy Committee in June, during which Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Washington, pressed him to state his position on the hydrogen hubs.

“It’s expensive to produce, but there are high value uses,” Wright went on to say about hydrogen. He predicted the agency will continue funding some projects under review, modify others and terminate the “low-value” ones.

Cantwell responded that the Northwest’s renewable hydropower made her region a good place to make hydrogen for hard-to-decarbonize sectors.

A spokesperson at Energy Department headquarters confirmed this past week that the program vetting was ongoing, but declined to estimate when the results will become known.

Democrats in the U.S. Senate preemptively wrote a joint letter to Wright in April asserting it would be illegal for the Trump administration to unilaterally cancel Congressionally-approved spending on clean energy projects. Oregon’s Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley and Washington’s Patty Murray and Cantwell signed on.

“Our Constitution gives Congress the power of the purse and exclusive power to appropriate funds,” the 27 senators wrote. “In this instance, where Congress has authorized and appropriated funds for programs that support clean energy projects, the Department must faithfully execute the law and expend the funds for the purposes provided.”

If the PNWH2 Hub survives the Energy Department vetting, the pressure will still be on. Earlier this year, the Republican-controlled Congress shortened the window for companies to get lucrative tax incentives that were created in the 2022 Biden climate and clean energy package.

Private developers now have until the end of 2027 to begin construction on a hydrogen plant in order to qualify for production tax credits. The deadline was previously 2033. Clean hydrogen producers strive to qualify for the tax credit in order to lower the otherwise high retail price of the fuel.

“Under current federal and state permitting regimes, this accelerated timeline may jeopardize our eligibility for the tax credit, which is essential for achieving positive project returns, and we are evaluating our ability to meet the new timelines,” said Doyle from AltaGas.

Europe Ltd. to acquire the Port of Nigg in northeast Scotland and part of the business owned by GEG (Holdings) Limited (""GEG""), jointly with Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, Ltd (MOL).

The acquisition spans steel processing and equipment manufacturing alongside base port operations serving the energy sector, with a primary focus on offshore wind and ongoing roles in oil and gas.

Upon closing, the assets are set to be operated by Global Energy Service Holding Limited (GESH), headquartered in Inverness, Scotland, with Mitsui holding 51% and MOL 49%.

In parallel, Mitsui will sell its equity in GEG’s remaining businesses back to the company’s founder.

The Port of Nigg’s position on Scotland’s North Sea coast, within the world’s largest offshore wind development area, makes it a strategic platform for staging, assembling and servicing large-scale projects.

By pairing Mitsui’s global industrial networks and investment track record in the UK, including prior work with STATS (UK) Ltd., with MOL’s maritime and port operations expertise, the partners aim to strengthen manufacturing capacity, modernise port services and integrate supply chains that accelerate renewable deployment.

Sustainability and energy transition impact

The UK’s twin goals of bolstering energy security and reaching net zero by 2050 depend on expanding reliable, efficient infrastructure for renewables.

Scaling the Port of Nigg’s port and fabrication capabilities is expected to ease bottlenecks that slow offshore wind projects, enabling clean generation to come online faster and displace higher-emission sources.

Localised heavy fabrication and assembly can shorten transport routes and reduce logistics emissions, while integrated port operations can improve throughput and reliability across the offshore wind value chain.

As the platform develops, there is scope to pursue operational decarbonisation, including greater use of renewable electricity, electrification of handling equipment, optimised vessel calls and routing and, where appropriate, shore power to curb at-berth emissions.

“While efforts towards decarbonisation seems to be slowing down currently, i believe the initiatives themselves are irreversible, which seems to be the consensus,” says Tetsuya Shigeta, Representative Director, Executive Vice President, CFO.

“If wind power generation slows down, we believe business viability can be secured by providing services for other businesses.”

Material efficiency, design optimisation and increased recycled content in steel processing can further lower embodied carbon in components.

These measures align with Mitsui’s material issues by helping to establish a foundation for sustainable and stable energy supply and by supporting a community that coexists with nature through responsible development and marine stewardship.

Transparent environmental management, biodiversity protection and ongoing monitoring will be essential to maintain community trust and minimise impacts as activity grows.

Local value, governance and timeline

The transaction creates a dedicated operating platform in GESH, which launched on 7 February 2024, is represented by Yoshihiro Hayakawa and employs 248 people.

Focused governance and clear ownership are expected to support investment, safety and performance improvements as the Port of Nigg evolves into a leading North Sea hub.

The development can catalyse high-quality, future-facing jobs in the Highlands and provide transition pathways for workers moving from oil and gas into offshore wind and advanced manufacturing.

Partnerships with colleges and training providers can expand the skills pipeline, while collaboration with local authorities and grid operators will be important to align transport and transmission upgrades with project growth.

Following completion in summer 2025, the partners plan to integrate port operations and manufacturing to deliver reliable, lower-carbon services to offshore wind developers.

Progress can be demonstrated through tangible outcomes, such as increased offshore wind capacity supported through the port, improved on-time and on-budget project delivery, reductions in Scope 1 and 2 emissions from port and fabrication activities and broader social indicators, including local employment, training and safety performance.

Ciattarelli also called out high electricity costs in his first general election campaign ad, pushing back on his rival’s critiques.
Come on, what does the president have to do with rising property taxes and higher electricity bills?” he says.
“I’ll lower electricity bills.” Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic nominee for governor in Virginia, unveiled a suite of policy proposals aimed at lowering energy costs, including a focus on local generation, weatherization, and regulatory reform.
Notably, Spanberger’s plan referenced “making sure data centers don’t drive up energy costs for everyone else in Virginia.” Additionally, Spanberger and a few others have made the connection between AI data centers and spiking electricity bills.","By David Wright, CNN

(CNN) — America’s aging power grid has faced strain for years, exacerbated by severe weather events, an explosion of data centers and the demand created by artificial intelligence.

Now, electricity is emerging as a top issue on the campaign trail.

Campaigns in this fall’s races for New Jersey and Virginia governors, as well as candidates in the upcoming midterms, are taking note of surging utility bills, in the latest sign that affordability has become central to campaigns at all levels.

In her first general election campaign ad, US Rep. Mikie Sherrill, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee in New Jersey, declares that on “Day One as governor, I’m declaring a state of emergency on utility costs, using emergency powers to end these rate hikes and drive down your bills.”

Jack Ciattarelli, Sherrill’s GOP opponent, unveiled his own first-day plan calling for more energy generation.

“We need to expand our nuclear capabilities in South Jersey, we need to accelerate solar, we can’t rely on wind,” Ciattarelli said on Fox News recently, laying blame with the outgoing Democratic administration of Gov. Phil Murphy.

Three leading Democratic organizations spent $8 million on an August ad campaign that linked rising electricity bills to GOP policymaking, arguing that the “One Big, Beautiful Bill” passed this summer “removes clean energy from the electric grid, creating a massive rate hike on electricity.”

Americans for Prosperity, a leading conservative group, launched a seven-figure ad campaign urging lawmakers “to unleash America’s energy potential by cutting red tape and eliminating counterproductive regulations.”

Energy Secretary Chris Wright has acknowledged the looming challenge both for power generation and for Republicans politically.

“It’s what I worry about most seven days a week,” he told Fox Business. “We want to stop the rise in electricity for Americans.”

Speaking to Politico, Wright was even more frank.

“Who’s going to get blamed for it? We’re going to get blamed because we’re in office.”

The Department of Energy, meanwhile, blamed the Biden administration’s policies for driving up electricity prices, and pointed to its efforts to “meet this rising power demand, fueled in part by the buildout of AI and data centers.”

“With President Trump’s leadership, the Department of Energy is reversing course: Ending subsidies that supported more expensive, less reliable energy, reversing policies that forced the premature closure of baseload power sources and expanding access to affordable, reliable, secure energy 24/7,” said Emery Washington, a spokesperson for the department.

“DOE is pursuing a strategy of energy addition—reforming costly permitting processes, keeping base load power online, and building more energy infrastructure needed to keep the lights and energy prices low for the American people.”

The power problem

The cost of power has set a record for two consecutive years in the country’s largest grid, covering a wide swath of competitive political territory that includes parts of Pennsylvania, Michigan, North Carolina, Virginia and New Jersey.

According to a May report from the US Energy Information Administration, “retail electricity prices have increased faster than the rate of inflation since 2022, and we expect them to continue increasing through 2026.”

The EIA separately noted this summer that “residential electricity prices in the Pacific, Middle Atlantic, and New England census divisions—regions where consumers already pay much more per kilowatt hour for electricity—could increase more than the national average.”

A big reason why is data centers. Campuses are springing up across the country, powering artificial intelligence technology and offering sought-after economic development. Their energy needs are enormous, however, with some data centers drawing as much power as 800,000 homes.

In Virginia – dubbed by one state industry group as the “data center capital of the world” – data centers consumed nearly a quarter of the electricity generated in the state in 2023, according to the Electric Power Research Institute, an independent nonprofit.

A report from the Department of Energy last year, meanwhile, estimated that data center energy use “is projected to double or triple by 2028.”

Spiking demand is driving bills up for individuals. In New Jersey, residential rates have climbed by up to 20%, and the tri-state Regional Plan Association found that “increased demand from data centers is attributed to about two-thirds of the increased prices.”

It’s also putting tremendous pressure on power grids that are already strained. According to another Energy Department report, “our aging infrastructure is struggling to meet our modern electricity needs,” and “70 percent of transmission lines are over 25 years old.” Studies from Pennsylvania State University and Columbia University have also linked grid vulnerabilities to increasing severe weather events.

According to an analysis from Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan think tank, power generation capacity could fall by 340 gigawatts by 2035, with one gigawatt being enough to power up to 1 million homes, while household energy costs could increase $170 annually due to the lost subsidies resulting from the “One, Big Beautiful Bill” passed over the summer.

Democrats argue that surging demand validates their support for alternative energy sources, pointing to President Donald Trump and Republicans slashing clean energy tax credits and canceling work on a nearly complete wind farm in Rhode Island. Republicans say it’s all the more reason to deregulate and ramp up fossil-fuel production.

Sherrill is positioning herself in the debate. “New Jersey isn’t generating even close to enough in-state power to keep costs low, and we risk missing the clean energy targets that we need to protect our environment for generations to come. I’m not going to accept that,” she wrote in her “Day One Declaration” plan.

Ciattarelli also called out high electricity costs in his first general election campaign ad, pushing back on his rival’s critiques. “All Mikie Sherrill wants to talk about is President Trump. Come on, what does the president have to do with rising property taxes and higher electricity bills?” he says. “I’ll lower electricity bills.”

Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic nominee for governor in Virginia, unveiled a suite of policy proposals aimed at lowering energy costs, including a focus on local generation, weatherization, and regulatory reform. Notably, Spanberger’s plan referenced “making sure data centers don’t drive up energy costs for everyone else in Virginia.”

Additionally, Spanberger and a few others have made the connection between AI data centers and spiking electricity bills. It opens a fraught debate about the rising cost of electricity to operate a technology, artificial intelligence, that could threaten some voters’ jobs.

And the Virginia League of Conservation Voters, a branch of the leading environmental group, is up with an ad blaming Republicans for higher bills, saying “big energy is raising prices” and arguing that “Virginia Republicans are helping big corporations rip you off.”",https://keyt.b-cdn.net/2023/08/nc312-combined-commercial-slate-860x484.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 11:06:05.482972

According to the CA, the EPA and inspectors with the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control conducted a Compliance Evaluation Inspection (CEI) under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) on April 10, 2024, at MBV’s Ladson, South Carolina plant, where Sprinter and eSprinter vans are assembled for the U.S. and Canadian markets.

Inspectors documented multiple alleged violations during the inspection.

MBV agreed to a civil penalty of $51,300, but neither admits nor denies allegations outlined in the CA, the release says.

The CA notes that MBV’s plant includes a body shop, paint body shop, and expanded assembly building. The company’s Hazardous Waste Generator Notification characterizes the facility as a large quantity generator (LQG) of hazardous waste.

During the inspection, it was found that MBV did not make accurate hazardous waste determinations, including a 5-gallon step container labeled “Excluded Solvent Contaminated Wipes Non-Hazardous, Flammable” in a rework area. It held paint-contaminated personal protective equipment (PPE). A facility representative stated that the PPE was hazardous debris and not a wipe.

Another 55-gallon container in a touch-up paint mix room was labeled in the same way but held hazardous debris and not wipes, the CA states.

A third 1-gallon container was labeled “spent OzzyJuice,” the CA says. It had at least 1 inch of clear yellow liquid in the paint shop maintenance area. Facility representatives were unable to identify the contents of the container.

In Satellite Accumulation Areas (SSA), a 5-gallon container with hazardous waste paint debris was sitting on plastic and surrounded by absorbent pads near the primer purge recovery system. Two mop buckets with solvent-contaminated water were found in the mix room storage area. In both cases, no one was actively adding or removing the waste, and the containers were not labeled as hazardous waste.

Inspectors also observed a release of primer paint underneath a pump for the primer purge recovery system’s grated secondary containment, the CA says. Facility representatives explained that the release happened the day before and was being allowed to dry before being cleaned up.

A bin in the loading area outside the mix room area was labeled “Scrap Metal Bin” and contained paint-contaminated PPE and multiple paint containers, many of which still contained paint and some of which had drained into the bottom of the bin, the CA says. It adds that inspectors observed hazardous waste paint released inside the scrap metal bin.

A quick reference guide included in the company’s contingency plan did not include a map of the facility showing where hazardous wastes are generated, accumulated, and treated, nor a street map of the facility, water supply locations, or the identification of on-site notification systems, the CA says.

MBV was also unable to produce the job descriptions for the contract employees managing hazardous waste and training records for three of the respondent’s employees responsible for signing and or managing the hazardous waste manifests and records, the CA says.

It says that MBV provided all but one of the records on July 30, after the inspection, and explained that the records were present at the faculty during the CEI. The exception was an employee’s hazardous waste training record that was not present at the facility during the CEI. The record was obtained on April 17 and included in the facility’s onsite files.

Some Delaware farmers are celebrating,Olivia Marble - Spotlight Delaware,,,,,https://www.delawarebusinessnow.com/news/agribusiness/trump-administration-cutting-solar-spending-some-delaware-farmers-are-celebrating/article_aa2ec52c-2b27-4234-b33a-79dbc0b17fea.html,"This is not the first time the Trump administration has ended funding for solar projects.
Dale Davis, president of CMI Solar and member of the Delaware Solar Energy Coalition, said the cuts to federal funding, the tax credits and high tariffs on importing solar panels will “definitely create a downward trend” in new solar projects across the country.
In 2023, Kent County approved new restrictions that banned massive solar projects on farmland in response to the growing number of solar projects in the county.
Individual solar projects now have a 50-acre limit in the county’s agriculture conservation zoning district, and there is a cap of 800 total acres that can be taken up by solar projects in that district.
Some solar on farms still funded Delaware farmers will still be able to get guaranteed loans for some solar projects, however.","U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced last month that her agency will no longer provide guaranteed loans to large-scale solar projects on farmland.

“Subsidized solar farms have made it more difficult for farmers to access farmland by making it more expensive and less available,” Rollins wrote in a press release.

Some Delaware farmers see this change as a win for farmland preservation.

“I am absolutely tickled to death,” said Jim Minner, Kent County Farm Bureau president. “We’re losing too much really good viable farmland to solar.”

The change follows a period of rising wholesale electricity costs across the mid-Atlantic – one that last year sparked a backlash from state governors who called for sweeping reforms, including faster approvals of proposed wind and solar projects.

It also comes as Delaware lawmakers try to push for increases in the amount of renewable power produced in the state. In 2024, about 9% of Delaware’s total in-state net generation came from renewable resources, with most of it produced by solar energy, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

State officials want that figure to reach 40% by 2035.

This is not the first time the Trump administration has ended funding for solar projects.

President Trump’s Reconciliation Budget Bill, also known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” signed into law this past July, made significant cuts to clean energy incentives.

The law eliminated residential clean energy tax credits, which allowed homeowners to deduct 30% of the systems’ costs from their taxes. The incentive will expire on Dec. 31.

In addition, companies and developers seeking to qualify for commercial clean energy tax credits must either start their projects before July 6, 2026, or have their projects in service by the end of 2027.

Dale Davis, president of CMI Solar and member of the Delaware Solar Energy Coalition, said the cuts to federal funding, the tax credits and high tariffs on importing solar panels will “definitely create a downward trend” in new solar projects across the country.

Farmers react

Minner said that local farmers are glad to see the USDA end the guaranteed loans to solar because of the rapid development of farmland in the southern part of the state.

“What we don’t lose to houses, we lose to solar panels,” he said.

Minner, who has been a crop farmer in Kent County for 35 years, recently lost a piece of farmland in the town of Viola that he had rented after the owners chose to lease it for community solar panels instead.

“That was the best piece of ground I had,” Minner said. “It’s in solar panels now. I didn’t own that. So, I had to take whatever was given.”

Minner argues the spread of solar panel projects onto productive farmland means less land available for agriculture, forcing small farmers like him to compete for what’s left while also facing higher costs, as the financial incentives for leasing land to solar companies are often far better than farming income.

“As more farmland goes into solar, all of us farmers are going to be fighting, competing for the same land, just – it’s not good,” he said.

This opposition to solar projects on farmland isn’t new.

In 2023, Kent County approved new restrictions that banned massive solar projects on farmland in response to the growing number of solar projects in the county.

Individual solar projects now have a 50-acre limit in the county’s agriculture conservation zoning district, and there is a cap of 800 total acres that can be taken up by solar projects in that district.

“I’m not opposed to solar, but I’m opposed to solar taking up valuable farmland,” said Tricia Nash, a Kent County farmer who advocated for the solar limits.

But Davis, the president of CMI Solar, said community solar projects on farms can actually help preserve farmland.

Farmers can make more money by leasing out parts of their land for solar projects than they could from farming it, helping financially support the rest of the farm, Davis said.

And once the lease on a solar project ends — usually after about 25 years — the land could go back to agricultural use, whereas the landscape would be permanently changed with other types of development.

“Once you build a house on it, it is never reverting back to agriculture, ever,” Davis said.

But Kent County farmer Paul Cartanza Sr. said it is “very, very expensive” to restore farmland to its original state after it has been used as a solar field.

Solar companies sometimes agree to front the cost of removing all their equipment after the lease is up, but the topography and health of the soil still needs to be restored, Cartanza said.

Some solar on farms still funded

Delaware farmers will still be able to get guaranteed loans for some solar projects, however.

The USDA Rural Development Rural Energy for America Program will give loans for solar projects that generate less than 50 kilowatts of power as long as they are “right sized” to only provide power to the farm itself.

New Castle County poultry farmer Greg Ains has one of these small-scale solar projects that produces about 21 kilowatts, about 90% of the power he needs to run his farm.

Greg Ains, a New Castle County poultry farmer, installed solar panels on his property in 2021 using state and federal grant funding.

In 2021, he received an $80,000 USDA grant and a $30,000 state grant to complete the project. The USDA now offers the guaranteed loans instead of grants.

The total cost was $328,000 with an estimated five-year return on investment, but with the grants, the return on investment shortened to three years.

State grants for solar projects, as well as low-interest loans, come from Energize Delaware, a state-created nonprofit that offers different programs and loans to support renewable energy projects in the state.

Energize Delaware Executive Director Drew Slater said in an email that the nonprofit has about $10 million of low-interest loans in the queue for approval. He said those loans are primarily for similar solar projects on poultry farms.

Slater also noted that despite the federal incentives being taken away, he’s seeing projects move forward more quickly instead of being delayed or postponed.

“We know that the investment tax credit, there’s some certainty that is going to go away, and so what we’ve seen is that solar installers and customers are more eager to do it right now and try and push that timeline as quickly as possible,” he said. “So we’re not in this period yet of projects being delayed, deferred or eliminated.”

Ains said he likely would have made his investment into solar power even without the grants. But many farmers don’t have the upfront capital to make such a long-term investment, so the grants and loans are critical to these projects, Davis said.

Ains is already seeing the benefits of his solar panels. Last month, his power bill was only about $300, and some months, he pays nothing at all. His power bills used to be about $4,000 a month.

While Ains is seeing a financial benefit from solar, he said he also opposes larger-scale solar fields on farmland for the same reason many farmers cited.

“Farmland is precious,” Ains said.

Until January, we had a strong partner in the federal government, and Colorado received hundreds of millions of dollars in clean energy and climate-related projects from the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.
Those are real lives saved by the kind of clean energy policies Evans just voted to dismantle.
No matter the individual health choices they make, they bear the burden, or will reap the benefits, of the choices we make together.
Clean energy is preventive medicine.","Colorado is one of the healthiest states in the country, but health isn’t determined by lifestyle choices alone. Our well-being is deeply influenced by the air we breathe, the water we drink and the environment we live in.

Too many Coloradans suffer the health impacts of pollution that are outside their control, especially children with asthma, seniors with respiratory issues and low-income communities near highways and industrial polluters. Despite this reality, U.S. Rep. Gabe Evans voted for a federal spending bill that cuts critical investments proven to reduce pollution and protect public health.

As a physician, I see these impacts up close in my patients every day. Poor air quality affects my patients even before they are born, impacting fetal lung development and resulting in an increase in premature births. When air quality is poor, I know that there will be more children in my clinic struggling to breathe from asthma. And despite living in beautiful Colorado, I have to tell kids it is not safe to play outside. We have a responsibility, as a community and a state, to make choices that create a clean and healthy environment for everyone.

The science is clear: The dirty fossil fuels we burn release pollutants and greenhouse gases that are endangering our health, especially in frontline communities living along highway corridors and around oil and gas operations, refineries and other polluting industries. According to the American Lung Association’s State of the Air report, 80% of Coloradans live in communities with unhealthy air.

Air pollution is one of the most dangerous threats to public health, more than high blood pressure, smoking or diabetes. It’s strongly linked to heart attacks, strokes, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, adverse pregnancy outcomes and even dementia.

Over the past 20 years, Colorado has led the way in reducing emissions and cleaning up our air. We’ve closed coal plants, expanded wind and solar energy, regulated methane emissions and been among the top states in the adoption of electric vehicles. We’ve installed electric vehicle chargers, bought electric school buses and strengthened building efficiency standards. These steps aren’t just good for the planet — they’re good for our lungs, our hearts and our families.

Until January, we had a strong partner in the federal government, and Colorado received hundreds of millions of dollars in clean energy and climate-related projects from the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

Now, Congress has passed a spending bill that not only eliminates the clean energy investments protecting our health, but takes away health care from the communities most impacted by higher levels of pollution. Evans helped make that happen. He had the chance to stand up for his constituents’ health; instead, he voted for legislation that puts Colorado communities at greater risk of pollution, illness and economic instability.

This summer, as ozone season worsens and more Coloradans are warned to stay inside, it’s important to remember that by cleaning up our air and cutting pollution, we make our communities healthier. One study predicted that national IRA investments in greenhouse gas reduction could, by 2050, prevent nearly 1 million asthma attacks, 41,000 heart attacks and 19,000 hospital admissions — a total of more than 3 million lost workdays and 33,000 deaths. Those are real lives saved by the kind of clean energy policies Evans just voted to dismantle.

Every Coloradan will benefit from cleaner, healthier energy. But let’s especially remember those disproportionately affected: children, pregnant individuals, the elderly, those with chronic illnesses, communities of color, people in historically redlined neighborhoods, and communities near highways, power plants or industrial facilities. No matter the individual health choices they make, they bear the burden, or will reap the benefits, of the choices we make together.

Clean energy is preventive medicine. Let’s prescribe more of it — and demand that our leaders prioritize it, too.",https://coloradonewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DSC_0545-2048x1365.jpeg,N,,2025-09-05 11:03:27.172430

Rivian is cutting less than 1.5% of its staff, mainly from its commercial team, to reduce costs ahead of the R2 launch.

The company lost $1.1 billion in Q2 but says it has sufficient funds to bring the $45,000 R2 SUV to market, aiming for broader appeal than its higher-priced models.

Expiring U.S. EV tax credits and regulatory changes are straining Rivian’s revenue, while other automakers like GM and Volkswagen are also scaling back production.

Rivian is laying off less than 1.5% of its workforce as the electric vehicle maker works to cut costs ahead of the launch of its next model, the R2 SUV, expected next year.

The job cuts affect roughly 225 employees, primarily within the company’s commercial team that oversees sales and service operations in the U.S. and Canada. A Rivian spokesperson said the reductions, effective immediately, are part of an effort to improve operational efficiency for the upcoming R2. Impacted workers are eligible for rehire and encouraged to apply for open positions.

Rivian, which had roughly 15,000 employees at the end of last year, has positioned the R2 as its mass-market entry model. Priced around $45,000, the SUV is expected to draw greater demand than the company’s higher-priced R1T pickup, starting at $70,990, and R1S SUV, starting at $76,900.

The company reported a $1.1 billion loss in the second quarter but stated that it has sufficient cash to bring the R2 to market. Rivian, which went public in 2021, has faced ongoing pressure to streamline operations and manage its liquidity.

Further, the layoffs occur as U.S. automakers prepare for the September 30 expiration of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit. The policy shift, combined with changes under the Trump administration that eliminated fines for fuel economy violations, has disrupted revenue streams for EV-only companies like Rivian. In a recent court filing, the company stated that the rule changes could result in an estimated $100 million in lost revenue from compliance credits.

Broader industry adjustments reflect similar concerns; for instance, General Motors announced this week that it temporarily laid off 360 workers at a Detroit plant producing the GMC Hummer EV and Cadillac Escalade IQ. Similarly, Volkswagen announced it will slow production of its ID.4 SUV at its Tennessee plant and furlough 160 employees to align with market demand.

Despite the challenges, Rivian expects the R2 to attract higher volume and help it reach a broader customer base.

He encouraged attendees to use what they learned during the conference in their grassroots efforts to build support for clean energy, especially when faced with extremism and misinformation.
Meanwhile, ​“this idea of behind-the-scenes picking winners and losers, that’s what’s going to create a reliability problem,” Stallings said.
House Bill 15 passed with unanimous support in the Ohio Senate and just two dissenting Republican votes in the House.
For one thing, the Ohio Senate removed provisions from HB 15 that would have created a community solar pilot program.","“While it’s easy to view this as a roadblock, … it’s a signal that we have more work to do,” Szoka said. He encouraged attendees to use what they learned during the conference in their grassroots efforts to build support for clean energy, especially when faced with extremism and misinformation. ​“If we don’t explain what’s going on clearly, we risk losing the argument before it even starts.”

Speaking at the conference, Jenifer French, chair of Ohio’s Power Siting Board and its Public Utilities Commission, noted that approximately 30 counties in the state ban solar or wind energy in all or parts of their territories, an authority granted to them by a 2021 law known as Senate Bill 52. The board or its staff have also determined solar and wind projects are not in the public interest in several cases where bans didn’t apply but where local governments unanimously opposed the proposals.

Companies often hear such suggestions, but ​“frankly, I think that’s used as a cop-out sometimes,” said Drew Christensen, senior director of public engagement at utility-scale developer Apex Clean Energy, during a later panel about how policies shape companies’ decisions.

No matter how many community meetings are held, some people will still fight projects, putting pressure on local officials who may not have expertise in energy issues, he noted.

The deference to local governments creates a slippery slope, said Amanda Stallings, senior policy manager for clean-energy developer Geronimo Power, who also spoke on the panel. In her view, the states that pile on restrictive policies will not only see less investment from solar and wind developers, but will also discourage other industries from moving in.

Constraints on renewables also tread on landowners’ property rights, Stallings said, pointing out that in some cases a local government tells farmers not to use their land for solar but would have no problem with a housing development.

“What country do we live in when our government tells us what we can and can’t do?” Stallings said. The point resonated with various attendees from state chapters of the Land and Liberty Coalition, who made comments during networking breaks that property owners should be free to make their own economic decisions about their land.

Meanwhile, ​“this idea of behind-the-scenes picking winners and losers, that’s what’s going to create a reliability problem,” Stallings said. That risk is already visible: Late last month, the grid operator ISO New England warned of potential reliability issues from delaying Revolution Wind, a nearly finished offshore project that the Trump administration has halted for now.

This past spring, Ohio managed to pass bipartisan legislation that is expected to help the state build more energy — both renewable and fossil-fueled — in large part because the law doesn’t pick winners, according to state Rep. Tristan Rader, D-Lakewood. House Bill 15 passed with unanimous support in the Ohio Senate and just two dissenting Republican votes in the House.

Speaking on a panel about the new law, Rader called it a big step but emphasized that the state still has barriers to getting additional renewable energy on the grid.

“We don’t need to incentivize it. In Ohio, we just need a level playing field,” he said.

For one thing, the Ohio Senate removed provisions from HB 15 that would have created a community solar pilot program. Two Republicans in the House have introduced a separate bill to revive a version of that measure.

Beyond that, the law left SB 52’s extra hurdles for solar and wind in place, along with property line setbacks for wind that were tripled by a last-minute addition to a 2014 budget law.

“We have put up a lot of barriers to different forms of power over the years,” said state Rep. Tex Fischer, R-Boardman, who noted that added levels of government review compound uncertainty for developers. ​“I think the solution is removing those barriers.”

In May, the Trump administration proposed to cut NASA’s 2026 budget by 25 percent and to cut spending for Earth and climate science in half.
The two satellites provide precise global measurements of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas that is warming the world.
The Trump administration has taken numerous steps to weaken or eliminate regulations and research projects designed to reduce planet-warming pollution.
That produced a satellite known as OCO 2, one of the two that the Trump administration wants to turn off.","Starting back in the Bush administration, the United States has spent more than $800 million launching powerful climate-monitoring satellite technology into space.

The satellites, known as the Orbiting Carbon Observatory missions, came with huge risks. In 2009 the first launch attempt failed, incinerating a satellite. But two later missions were successful, and today the satellites are in “perfect health,” according to a government report issued in January.

Now, however, the Trump administration wants to scrap them as a money-saving measure.

It’s like buying a car “and then running it into a tree after a few years, just to save the price of tank of gas,” said David Crisp, a former scientist at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory who led the missions to launch the satellites, which help monitor plant life and greenhouse gases and are used by forecasters, farmers and scientists.

He noted that most of the expense of the satellites was at the front end. “They cost a vast amount to build,” he said. But, once in orbit, “they cost a fraction of that a year to operate.” The satellites have more than a decade of life left in them, Dr. Crisp said.

In May, the Trump administration proposed to cut NASA’s 2026 budget by 25 percent and to cut spending for Earth and climate science in half. Bethany Stevens, the NASA spokeswoman, said the president’s 2026 budget aimed to realign the agency with the “core mission of space exploration.”

At other science agencies, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Science Foundation, the administration has also asked Congress to shrink spending for next year. A smaller budget request “provides ample resources to advance our mission while cutting through bureaucratic bloat and agenda-driven programs that dilute NOAA’s impact,” said Kim Doster, the agency’s spokeswoman.

Congress has resisted the Trump administration’s proposed cuts. Budget bills currently under consideration in both chambers would restore funding at all three agencies to near-current levels. Still, weeks remain before a final funding package is approved and the numbers could change.

Some agencies are already preparing to follow the president’s version of the budget, such as making plans to turn off satellites, according to two senior officials at federal science agencies who requested anonymity out of concern over retribution.

The two satellites provide precise global measurements of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas that is warming the world. The data has been used in climate reports issued by both the United States and the United Nations and has been an important resource for other countries as they assess ways to cut greenhouse gas emissions.

The Trump administration has taken numerous steps to weaken or eliminate regulations and research projects designed to reduce planet-warming pollution. It has rolled back clean air and clean water regulations on industry and has moved to kill a scientific conclusion known as the endangerment finding, which provides the basis for the federal government to regulate greenhouse gases on the grounds that they endanger public health.

Before the Orbiting Carbon Observatory missions were approved by the George W. Bush administration in 2002, scientists relied on Earth-based sensors to measure atmospheric carbon dioxide. (The longest-running monitoring station, the Mauna Loa observatory, would also be eliminated in the NOAA budget proposal.)

After the first OCO satellite failed to launch in 2009, Dr. Crisp went back to Congress and won approval to try again. That produced a satellite known as OCO 2, one of the two that the Trump administration wants to turn off.

One could end up incinerating in the Earth’s atmosphere if it were decommissioned. The other monitoring device, known as OCO 3, was built out of OCO 2’s spare parts and orbits the Earth affixed to the International Space Station.

Together, the two satellites produce data that helps scientists understand where atmospheric carbon dioxide comes from, where it goes, and where plant life is thriving. The data can also be used to monitor wildfires, ocean health and agricultural outlooks.

“We built these satellites and got them approved and got taxpayer dollars to build them because they serve critical functions in commerce, in national security, in food security, in water security,” Dr. Crisp said.

Without funding to operate them, the two missions are at risk of going offline along with three older missions — known as Terra, Aqua, and Aura — that are also still producing valuable climate and weather data. Another imperiled mission that monitors the atmosphere, Sage III, has been attached to the International Space Station since 2017.

Dr. Crisp said there was another option, though it comes with risks that could damage the satellite. Essentially it would involve trying to park the satellite in a lower orbit. It would no longer be producing data, but putting it on standby in this way could potentially preserve it for future use.

Employees at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory who work on the satellites consulted with him about this possibility, he said, given his knowledge of the satellite designs. Parking the satellite in a lower orbit would be a way to meet the Trump administration’s budget priorities without destroying the taxpayer investment, he said.

Still, the data stream that scientists, farmers and others rely on would be interrupted. There are no other satellites with the same monitoring capabilities.

“The measurement network that we currently have is very fragile and not as resilient as people think it is,” said Ben Poulter, a senior scientist studying greenhouse gas emissions Spark Climate Solutions, a nonprofit group. He was formerly deputy director of the Biden administration’s Greenhouse Gas Measurement Monitoring Reporting and Verification program.

This scarcity was illustrated in 2023, when the Lahaina fire devastated Maui, Hawaii. Because the timing of satellites passing over didn’t line up with the blaze, he said, “What you ended up having was one of the most catastrophic fires that the U.S. has had, and not enough observations from space.” Services provided by the satellites, like understanding disasters in real time or getting weather forecasts on our phones, he said, is “something we take for granted.”

If you terminate one satellite mission and then try to start another one, it’s scientifically difficult to account for the gap in the data, said Steve Volz, assistant administrator for the NOAA’s Satellite and Information Service. “That’s why continuity and bridging missions across different generations is really important,” he said.

The United States has long been a leader in greenhouse gas monitoring technology, particularly in space. While countries like China and Japan also have climate monitoring satellites, OCO 2 and OCO 3 are more precise.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/04/science/00CLI-SATELLITES-06/00CLI-SATELLITES-06-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 08:01:20.833359

According to Electrek, BYD unveiled the Atto 1 at the Gaikindo Indonesia International Auto Show in July.

The Standard Range Dynamic trim has a range of about 185 miles. The Long Range Premium trim has a larger battery that offers a range of over 235 miles.

What makes this new EV stand out from the competition is that the standard version costs the equivalent of just $12,000, while the premium costs $14,500.

According to Kelley Blue Book, the average cost of a new EV in the United States is over $55,500. The Atto 1 costs a fraction of that, but is currently not available in the U.S.

The benefits of owning an EV are substantial, from financial savings to environmental advantages.

EV owners can save money on fuel and maintenance. Unlike gas-powered vehicles, EVs don't need oil or fluid changes, reducing the routine cost of maintenance. Electric cars are also zippy and fun to drive, but have quieter engines to reduce noise pollution.

They also reduce air pollution caused by tailpipe emissions. An MIT study found that gas-powered vehicles create an average of 350 grams of carbon pollution per mile driven over their lifetimes. EVs only create 200 grams of pollution per mile, and that includes emissions created from charging batteries.

Reducing tailpipe pollution creates cleaner, safer air for everyone and helps slow climate change. EVs can lessen the environmental impact of driving even more when charged using solar panels.

If you install solar panels on your home, you can reduce your utility bills and lower the cost of powering your car. Installing solar panels is affordable when you use EnergySage's free tools to compare local quotes and find a trusted installer.

People in the Electrek comment section were thrilled about this low-cost EV.

The top comment read, ""I think this class of car will make a major difference in many countries with several billion people aspiring to have car ownership.""

Someone else said, ""The days of $1,000 top-of-the-line EVs are not that far away.""

Another person noted the benefits of combining EV ownership with solar panels, commenting, ""These inexpensive nice Chinese EVs combined with dirt cheap solar PV are going to be a MASSIVE game-changer for the global South.""",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/CPeyd6G0y8lRZr1zReaRqg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/cbcb740bf67a14aab41ecb2fff671d70,N,,2025-09-05 07:00:06.511456

TRANSCRIPTION:

David Fair: This is 89.1 WEMU, and I'd like to welcome you to our First Friday Focus on the Environment. Each month, we get together and discuss the challenges and possibilities when it comes to the health of our air, land and water. A changing climate poses a myriad of challenges, and how we mitigate and adapt to that reality is a work in progress. I'm David Fair, and my co-host for these conversational journeys is Lisa Wozniak. Lisa is executive director of the Michigan League of Conservation Voters. And today, we get to talk about creating a climate conducive to progress when it comes to environmental health. How you doing, Lisa?

Lisa Wozniak: Well, I'm doing very well, David, but I am wondering how we got nine months into this year already. It's gone so fast, especially this summer!

David Fair: It has been a whirlwind!

Lisa Wozniak: It has! So, as the seasons change, so does the climate. And there are a couple of firsts when it comes to climate action at the University of Michigan. Later this month, the university is going to hold its first ever Climate Week. And there's no one better to talk about climate issues and the work ahead than the University of Michigan's first-ever Vice Provost for Sustainability and Climate Action. Her name is Shalanda Baker. And she's on the other end of the WEMU phone line. So, thanks so much for the time today, Shalanda! We really appreciate it!

Dr. Shalanda Baker: Thank you so much! I'm really excited to be a part of this conversation!

David Fair: Well, before we talk about Climate Week, let's talk about your role on campus and what it brings to the climate conversation. How do you view your role as Vice Provost for Sustainability and Climate Action?

Dr. Shalanda Baker: Oh, I love that question! So, as you mentioned, I'm the first-ever Vice Provost for Sustainability and Climate Action here at the University of Michigan. And I see my role as one that stands on the shoulders of so many who made a way for a role like mine to exist at the very highest levels within the Provost's office here at the university. And so, for many years, I would say for a couple of decades, people have been advocating for leadership to organize, to coalesce, to catalyze our research community and our students to ensure that we can actually make an impact in real time. So many of your listeners probably know that the University of Michigan leads in so many areas, including those related to sustainability, energy, our built environment, but there hasn't been someone who can sort of steer the ship, if you will, to ensure that we're all moving in the same direction and we're moving toward impact, which is really what we need in this very decisive decade.

Lisa Wozniak: So, I am sure that your position could take you in a number of different directions. How do you identify the priorities and the major initiatives?

Dr. Shalanda Baker: Sure. So, you're absolutely right! I mean, I came into a blank slate, which I love. I'm a little bit of an entrepreneur by nature. But there are three kind of main categories of my work. There's the curriculum area, there is the research area, and then, there's the community impact area. And that's kind of how I've schematically organized it in my brain to keep me more focused. On the curricular side, we're really thinking about ways every single student who moves to the University of Michigan gets exposure to climate themes, climate education, sustainability education, regardless of major. And so, I'm working with our leadership across the university to ensure that that is true and to support our faculty to be able to teach about these topics, again, regardless of their own subject matter expertise. We know, in so many ways, climate is everything. It's going to impact every single area of life. And so, we need to get our faculty the tools, but then also to prepare our students for the world that they will absolutely inhabit when they leave our doors. On the research side, I think you're right. There are tons and tons of ways to approach the research aspect of this portfolio. The goal is to, again, synthesize our community, so that we're all moving together to solve the naughtiest problems of the day around issues of sustainability and climate and to begin to build interdisciplinary teams to tackle problems. One of the things that strikes me every day as I walk in the door is we have 100 programs in our graduate programs that are in the top 10 nationally. I mean, no other university has that kind of depth and breadth. And so, the question is, how do you get folks to work together to, again, solve the most challenging issues of the day?

David Fair: They say timing is everything, and you've come to work at a most interesting political time. We've seen significant rollbacks in environmental and climate protections at the federal level. We've seen rollbacks and research funding. How do these actions threaten the University of Michigan's sustainability commitments on and around campus?

Dr. Shalanda Baker: Yeah. So, I am so grateful to be at a university that is still laser-focused on climate action, on sustainability, on issues of equity in the environment. And the university has a very long history in all of those areas. I mean, we were one of the catalysts for the first-ever Earth Day in this country. We began the country's first-ever environmental justice program at a university, and now, that's the standard around the country. And we were the first-ever university to have a school for natural resources. So, again, I stand on the shoulders of all the folks who made that true. And now, I'm carrying the torch into the next decade to ensure that we continue to lead, particularly during this challenging moment. I mean, our students are coming into the university, in many cases, having experienced climate issues in their communities. So, we can't hide the fact that the climate is changing. We have some of the world's best scientists on climate science on our campus. Many of us have authored peer-reviewed publications dealing with the science related to climate change, dealing with science related to our water system, our energy system. And so, I'm grateful that we're staying the course. We're obviously wanting to just stay focused wanting to bring folks together to continue to be able to do their work.

David Fair: This is 89.1 WEMU's First Friday Focus on the Environment, and our guest is Shalanda Baker, the first ever Vice Provost for Sustainability and Climate at the University of Michigan. The other voice you hear today is that of my co-host, Lisa Wozniak.

Lisa Wozniak: You mentioned environmental justice, and I was lucky enough to study with Dr. Bunyan Bryant, who was at the forefront of so much of that work at the University of Michigan and deeply connected to community. So, my question for you is, how is the university currently working to ensure that institutional sustainability goals complement and support community work and, notably, Ann Arbor's A2Zero initiative?

Dr. Shalanda Baker: I love it! So, I love that question! It's just sort of giving me chills because I come to this work as a scholar activist. I come to the university after having spent the last decade-and-a-half of my career as an academic really thinking about how our work can make a difference in real time in communities. And my work has mainly been around the energy system and energy justice. Here, though, the question is always about how we can leverage our community to move at scale. And so, you opened the program talking about Climate Week, and that is a way in which we can open the doors of the university to our community members. So, absolutely opening the doors to Ann Arbor, but we're also bringing in busses and busses and busses of students from Detroit from the 48217 zip code, which is the most polluted zip code in the state, to witness what is happening at this university. I'm hoping it will be electric. These are students who may or may not have ever been exposed to a place like the University of Michigan. And so, this is one way in which we're really trying to lower the barriers to access this community--this research community--the resources that we have within it. So, Climate Week is one way we're doing that where there would just be sort of concentric rings of engagement, again, starting at the university campus, but moving out through Ann Arbor, moving out into Detroit, and hopefully the state. We also have a day of service embedded in Climate Week, so our kickoff will be on September 30th in our Diag here, or actually, I think it's September 29th. I don't want to misspeak--

David Fair: I think it's the 27th.

Dr. Shalanda Baker: Well, the first day is the 27th, but we actually have our kickoff in the Diag on campus on the 29th on a Monday.

David Fair: Gotcha!

Dr. Shalanda Baker: So, that also kicks off our day of service, because we have to be in service to each other and in service of our community if we're going to get this right. So, Climate Week is one way we're doing the engagement that you talked about, Lisa. I think the other thing is the folks over at the Michigan Climate Action Network. I've been able to engage Denise, who is their executive director, pretty regularly, and, in the early parts of 2025, we said, ""How are we going to catalyze our community to continue to move toward climate action?"" And so, we put our heads together, we built a team, and, for the last eight months, we've been working to develop what I hope is a transformative fellowship program for students here at the University of Michigan to go into communities where the nodes of the Michigan Climate Action Network are located. And so, we're piloting that program. We're calling it the Michigan Community Climate Action Fellowship Program, where we hope to embed students in places like the U.P., Western Michigan, Central Michigan, of course, here in Southeast Michigan as well. And so, at scale, we'll have about 150 students a year embedded in places, and that'll change their lives. And so, we want that to be available to mainly our first and second year students from our Dearborn campus, our Flint campus, and also here at our Ann Arbor campus. And so, that's another way that we're trying to sort of expose our students to what's happening in the state in real time around climate, but also to support and uplift our climate warriors who are out there every single day working to make their communities a better place.

David Fair: I am fascinated and hope to talk to you again in the future and see how far we move forward in the months and years to come!

Dr. Shalanda Baker: Keep me accountable! I'm excited!

,Detroit and Evs,2025-09-05 09:45:46+00:00,electrive.com,General Motors slows down on electric SUV production,Chris Randall,,,,,https://www.electrive.com/2025/09/05/general-motors-slows-down-on-electric-suv-production/,"Among other things, two Cadillac electric SUVs are manufactured there: the Lyriq and the Vistiq.
Three of the four models now affected by reduced production are conspicuously large electric vehicles.
At the same time, however, the company announced another affordable next-generation electric vehicle for its plant in Kansas.
GM is currently recording growing sales figures in the US for both petrol and electric vehicles.
The company emphasises that, thanks to the 13 electric car models now available from its brands in the US, it will become the second-largest seller of electric vehicles behind Tesla in the second half of 2024.","According to Reuters, citing insider sources, General Motors’ “market adjustments” are now focusing on the Spring Hill plant in Tennessee. Among other things, two Cadillac electric SUVs are manufactured there: the Lyriq and the Vistiq. According to the news agency, production of these two vehicles will be curtailed in the first five months of 2026 by temporarily laying off one of two shifts. In addition, the plant is to close for an additional week in October and November. The mid-size Cadillac Lyriq SUV is one of GM’s better-selling electric cars. The Vistiq is an even larger SUV with lower sales figures.

Another new piece of information is that GM is apparently also postponing the start of a second shift at its Fairfax assembly plant near Kansas City, ‘indefinitely,’ as Reuters writes. Production of the new Chevrolet Bolt is scheduled to begin there later this year. The model is considered a great hope for GM and is set to hit car dealerships in 2026 as the most affordable electric model in the current portfolio. The vehicle, which GM has only teased so far, is the second generation of the US bestseller first launched in 2016. The first generation was marketed for seven years between 2016 and 2023.

GM itself has been rather vague about the leaked shift changes and cancellations. The company told Reuters: “General Motors is making strategic production adjustments in alignment with expected slower EV industry growth and customer demand by leveraging our flexible ICE (internal combustion engine) and EV manufacturing footprint.”

Earlier this week, it was announced that the manufacturer also plans to produce fewer units of the GMC Hummer EV and Cadillac Escalade IQ in Detroit-Hamtramck. Three of the four models now affected by reduced production are conspicuously large electric vehicles. This makes sense insofar as demand in the US has declined, particularly for these large models, and is expected to decline further due to the abolition of the tax credit for electric cars (from 30 September). In contrast, new GM entry-level models such as the Chevrolet Equinox EV and Blazer EV are recording significantly higher sales figures.

Against this backdrop, General Motors presented a more differentiated product strategy in early summer. GM is shifting back to petrol engines in its planned drive mix. At the same time, however, the company announced another affordable next-generation electric vehicle for its plant in Kansas.

GM plans to invest around four billion US dollars over the next two years to increase production at its US plants. Three vehicle plants in Michigan, Kansas and Tennessee are set to benefit most from this investment, with the aim of assembling ‘more than two million vehicles per year in the US’ in future. Exactly how production volumes will be distributed among the various drive types has not been specified. However, GM outlined its planned production start-ups as follows in June:

The Orion Assembly plant in Michigan will start production of petrol-powered SUVs and light pickups in early 2027. The original plan was to manufacture electric pickups there from 2026.

The Fairfax Assembly plant in Kansas will begin production of the recently launched petrol-powered Chevrolet Equinox, which is currently only built in Mexico, in mid-2027. Fairfax will also begin building the Chevrolet Bolt EV by the end of the year, and part of GM’s newly announced investment will go towards preparing the site for the construction of affordable next-generation electric cars.

At the Spring Hill Manufacturing plant in Tennessee, GM will begin production of the Chevy Blazer combustion engine vehicle in 2027, which is currently also manufactured in Mexico. It will then be produced alongside the aforementioned electric Cadillacs Lyriq and Vistiq and the petrol-powered Cadillac XT5.

The numerous petrol engine product launches are in line with GM’s recent announcement that it will invest $888 million in the Tonawanda Propulsion plant near Buffalo, New York, to build GM’s next-generation V8 engine. Meanwhile, the Factory Zero plant in Detroit-Hamtramck (also Michigan) is set to remain GM’s dedicated electric vehicle factory and the exclusive assembly site for the Chevrolet Silverado EV, GMC Sierra EV, Cadillac Escalade IQ and GMC Hummer EV (pickup and SUV). However, this will be accompanied by the measures outlined above to temporarily reduce production.

GM is currently recording growing sales figures in the US for both petrol and electric vehicles. The company emphasises that, thanks to the 13 electric car models now available from its brands in the US, it will become the second-largest seller of electric vehicles behind Tesla in the second half of 2024. GM even describes the month of August, which has just ended, as the best month ever for electric vehicles: the manufacturer sold 21,000 battery-powered vehicles across all its brands.

The implication from the White House is that a deal was made: A lifted stop work order in exchange for pipeline approval.
“I would like to see the governor and the DEC approve these pipeline projects,” said Assemblyman Phil Palmesano, ranking member on the Energy Committee.
“Governor Hochul is finally beginning to realize what many of us have warned all along: New York’s so-called climate agenda is a sinking ship.
Hochul, told Spectrum News 1 the only commitment the governor has made is to work with anyone on new energy projects that follow state law.","Gov. Kathy Hochul is facing pressure from all directions when it comes to two controversial pipeline gas projects. The Northeast Supply Enhancement Pipeline (NESE) and Constitution Pipelines have both faced repeated rejections from the state Department of Environmental Conservation, but have seen their applications revived after conversations between Hochul and President Donald Trump earlier this year.

NESE is further along and recently saw the public comment period conclude after a brief extension amid calls from Democrats in Congress for even more time.

The two projects are both by Williams Companies. They saw that revival after conversations between the two resulted in Hochul successfully having a stop order on a New York offshore wind project lifted by the Trump administration. The implication from the White House is that a deal was made: A lifted stop work order in exchange for pipeline approval. Hochul has denied that any agreement was reached, but for many climate activists, the fact that Trump got what he wanted and the Northeast pipeline is now up for DEC consideration following a public comment period with no change from previous rejected proposals is all they need to hear.

“We can’t do this in New York,” state Sen. Liz Krueger said in a Thursday morning virtual news conference.

“They are dangerous, they will do harm to people in any number of communities across the state. They are not necessary, they will put us backwards on our goals,” she said of the pipelines.

Democratic state lawmakers teamed up with environmental advocates to urge Hochul and the DEC to say no. Krueger said the Trump administration has operated on a system of manipulating the policies of states to fit his agenda, and is urging Hochul to provide a firewall.

“States need to stand up and say, ‘no, we’re not going to do these things,’” she said. “There is no better example for us than New York having to say, ‘no, we’re not going to approve pipelines we’ve already rejected on endless environmental grounds,’” she said.

The fact that the pipelines, and especially NESE, had been rejected multiple times and the current process only kicked up after Hochul met with Trump is particularly bothersome for lawmakers like State Sen. Michelle Hinchey. She railed against the company for submitting essentially the same proposal as what was already rejected.

“No change to the project, no mind-blowing changes in science, nothing has changed,” she said. “Yet we are back here again fighting for the health and safety of our communities.”

Even entertaining talk of possible legislation to limit the ability for companies to continue submitting the same proposals after they’ve been rejected.

“I am certainly open to those discussions,” Krueger said before Hinchey added, “At some point we have to draw the line and say now you’re just wasting resources and time, and we need to be focusing on projects that are real and can move forward.”

Assemblymember Anna Kelles added that she expects the state will be sued for violating its own climate law if the pipelines are approved.

Hochul’s estranged Lieutenant Governor and primary opponent Antonio Delgado piled on in a conversation with Capital Tonight’s Susan Arbetter Thursday.

Republicans in the state Legislature's minority conferences are unsurprisingly singing a different tune.

“I would like to see the governor and the DEC approve these pipeline projects,” said Assemblyman Phil Palmesano, ranking member on the Energy Committee.

He argued the state needs an all of the above approach to energy, including natural gas. Plus, he said the current status of natural gas being trucked to inaccessible areas after previous rows over pipelines under former Gov. Andrew Cuomo. is hardly environmentally friendly.

“We need these pipelines to bring the gas to the market to get it to these areas so they can have reliable, dispatch-able energy,” he said.

State Sen. George Borrello flipped the script, accused Hochul of using Trump to navigate challenges New York’s is facing in meeting its lofty climate goals.

“Governor Hochul is finally beginning to realize what many of us have warned all along: New York’s so-called climate agenda is a sinking ship. That’s why she is trying to have it both ways—pushing forward with costly, unreliable offshore wind turbines while at the same time green-lighting pipelines that should have been approved years ago,” he said. “The truth is, the Governor has been a cheerleader for this failed climate crusade from the start, and now she’s scrambling for cover.”

Ken Lovett, senior communications advisor on Energy and Environment for Gov. Hochul, told Spectrum News 1 the only commitment the governor has made is to work with anyone on new energy projects that follow state law.

“As the White House rejects any new permitting of offshore wind projects and Republicans in Congress cut billions in subsidies for renewable energy, we'd hope these legislators and advocates would join the Governor in pushing an all-of-the-above approach to ensure we keep the lights on for New Yorkers while also prioritizing affordability and strong economic development,” he said. “The Governor has made it clear that all proposed projects must be reviewed impartially by the required agencies to determine compliance with state and federal laws.""",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/ap-hochul-30_(1),N,,2025-09-05 08:01:25.196708

Why are electric bills in Indiana higher this summer?

Electric bills in Indiana, including Monroe County, are higher this summer than a year ago because of higher electricity rates and above-normal temperatures.

State regulators early this year approved a request by Duke Energy to be allowed to raise its electric rates.

A spokeswoman for the utility said the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission allowed Duke Energy to raise its rates by about 9% in February, which is contributing to rates this summer being higher than a year ago. Rates will increase another roughly 4% early next year.

However, Duke’s Lead Communications Manager McKenzie Barbknecht said higher temperatures this summer also have contributed.

Average temperatures in Bloomington this summer:

June: 75.6 degrees, or 3.6 degrees above normal, Barbknecht said via email.

July: 79.3 degrees, or 4.6 degrees above normal.

August, as of the middle of the month: 76.4 degrees, or 2.4 degrees above normal.

What does Duke Energy plan to do with the additional revenue?

The utility said in a news release early this year that it asked state regulators to be allowed to hike rakes “to continue making investments in a modernized electric grid that is more resistant to power outages, increasing reliability at our power plants, constructing hundreds of miles of new power lines, complying with evolving environmental responsibilities and improving electric grid security.”

The utility said that among other things, it has been installing:

Sensors on power lines that can detect problems automatically and would reroute power, much like a GPS system in a car reroutes a driver.

Underground power lines and steel poles to replace wood poles to harden its system against severe weather.

How can you lower your electric bill?

Duke and the U.S. Department of Energy said you can reduce your electricity usage by:

Raising your thermostat.

Using cool water to wash clothes.

Running heat-producing appliances in the morning when it’s cooler.

Closing curtains on the sunny side of your home.

Operating ceiling fans (counterclockwise).

Buying energy-efficient appliances, electronics and lights.

Reducing “always-on” appliances. Look for electronics that you don’t use or can switch off — or perhaps get rid of that extra refrigerator.

Are we done for the year with high temps? What's the forecast?

While many Hoosiers have gotten a nice break from summer heat in the past few days, with highs in the low- to mid-70s, the mercury is expected to rise again in Bloomington, with highs in the mid-80s in mid-September, according to The Weather Channel — though lows will remain in the mid- to high 50s.

Multibillion-dollar investments typically take years to gel, and that means companies want to know that policies won't change drastically.
But despite the uncertainty, the Entergy executive said he remained bullish on the state’s prospects.
“We went from having people saying ‘What is Meta doing in Louisiana?’ to having them say, ‘Why aren’t we in Louisiana?’” May said.
May said he isn’t worried that will happen, and argued that Meta investments in transmission infrastructure, resilience upgrades and the plants themselves represent a benefit to customers.","More than 18 months after Louisiana officials began wooing executives from Meta to the state, eventually helping land the Facebook parent company’s massive artificial intelligence data center near Monroe, Entergy Louisiana CEO Phillip May said he sees more economic development potential in the state than at any time in his 40-year career.

“We have the greatest economic pipeline since the post-World War II years,” May said in an interview Tuesday. “We have growth from the traditional petrochemical sector and also a new set of opportunities.”

At the same time, however, profound and rapid changes to the nation’s energy and trade policies under President Donald Trump are threatening to chill new investments as companies grapple with the uncertainty.

“Companies are trying to make 30-, 40-, 50-year decisions, and policy shifts make it hard,” May said. “If something is hurting us in Louisiana right now, more than anything else, it is uncertainty.”

The way the estimated $10 billion Meta deal came together — less than a year separated Entergy’s initial pitch to Meta and the formal announcement by Gov. Jeff Landry — was highly unusual, May said.

Multibillion-dollar investments typically take years to gel, and that means companies want to know that policies won't change drastically.

“Risk scares business and they cannot make a decision when we continue to change policy,” he said.

'Why aren't we in Louisiana'

May’s comments highlighted how the Trump administration's policies are rippling through board rooms in Louisiana and elsewhere, with business leaders working to adjust to big changes in tariffs, renewable tax credits and federal funding. But despite the uncertainty, the Entergy executive said he remained bullish on the state’s prospects.

Among the recent investments planned for the state that give him reason for optimism are Hyundai’s planned steel mill in Ascension Parish, Shintech's expansion in Plaquemines Parish and Shell's plan to break ground on a new New Orleans headquarters in the planned River District neighborhood in 2027.

The Meta announcement has also helped Louisiana’s credibility with other tech and infrastructure companies, according to May.

“We went from having people saying ‘What is Meta doing in Louisiana?’ to having them say, ‘Why aren’t we in Louisiana?’” May said.

Entergy is building three natural gas power plants to supply electricity to the data center, including two that are adjacent to the site in Holly Ridge and one in St. Charles Parish. Meta has agreed to pay for construction and the cost of operating the plants for 15 years.

Environmental groups and advocates for renewable energy have criticized the plan and questioned whether consumers will get hit with higher utility bills if Meta bails on the plant after 15 years.

May said he isn’t worried that will happen, and argued that Meta investments in transmission infrastructure, resilience upgrades and the plants themselves represent a benefit to customers.

“Louisiana customers will continue to get low-cost power from the plants,” even if Meta were to pull out after 15 years, May said, adding that by then, much of the grid’s infrastructure will need upgrades and that “customers will be paying for that as they would.”

In middle Atlantic and Northern states where large data centers have been operating for years, residential customers have seen monthly utility bills go up by 20% to 30% in some cases. May said he believes that is unlikely to happen in Louisiana, where utilities are regulated.

“Those states are deregulated,” he said. “If you’re in a competitive market like that and prices are at an all-time high, it gets passed along to everyone.”

Dark future for renewables

May is concerned, however, about the future of solar projects in the state, including those in development both by Entergy and its competitors. The Trump administration, with approval from Congress, did away with several types of renewable energy tax credits created under President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act.

Though the changes were intended to bolster the traditional fossil fuel industry, energy producing states like Louisiana were also benefiting from new investments in wind and solar power.

Now, many of those projects will never come to fruition, May said.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/4e/14e517fc-3725-57bf-9c1f-2a4de5a05fbe/685ef5fbf1a13.image.jpg?crop=1563%2C821%2C0%2C252&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-09-05 07:00:19.029778

14 hours ago

Chris BaraniukTechnology Reporter

A day care centre for children, a gym, a tax advisor – and a mini experimental steel plant. These businesses are among those that make up a small retail and industrial estate in the city of Woburn, Massachusetts.

""People are dropping off their kids. That kind of shows you an extreme example of what the future of steel looks like,"" says Adam Rauwerdink, vice president of business development at US-based green steel start-up, Boston Metal. ""You can be making steel and sharing a parking lot with a daycare.""

Boston Metal has come up with a way of using electricity to remove oxides and other contaminants from iron ore, which is the substance you have to mine from the Earth before you can make new steel.

The process involves distributing the ore within an electrolyte and then using electricity to heat this mixture to 1,600C. Molten iron then separates from impurities and can be tapped off.

Traditionally, extracting that all-important iron from ores requires blast furnaces that run on fossil fuels. But the iron and steel industry are responsible for 11% of global emissions – a huge amount, equivalent to all the world's private cars and vans – and so now a race is on to find greener ways of producing these important metals.

US companies are, arguably, at the forefront. Steelmaking in the US is already greener than in many countries, thanks to the popularity of electric arc furnaces there. These furnaces use electricity, not heat from burning fossil fuels, to melt scrap steel – for example – and recycle it.

Plus, a handful of emerging start-ups such as Boston Metal say they can go one better and use electricity for the iron-making process, a crucial step in making brand new, or virgin, steel.

However, the Trump administration has taken a less than enthusiastic stance towards renewable energy and decarbonisation projects. It remains to be seen whether these new start-ups will make a big, molten splash in the steel industry any time soon.

Switching from traditional blast furnaces to electric arc furnaces can lower carbon emissions per tonne of steel produced from 2.32 tonnes of CO2 to 0.67 tonnes of CO2.

For iron-making, some plants could use green hydrogen – made using electricity from 100% renewable sources – says Simon Nicholas, lead steel analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

But switching iron and steel-making plants over to green hydrogen hasn't gone as smoothly as some had expected.

In June, Cleveland-Cliffs, a major US steel producer, appeared to back away from its plans to build a $500m (£375m) hydrogen-powered steel plant in Ohio. The BBC has contacted Cleveland-Cliffs for comment.

""We're seeing projects cancelled, proponents pulling out of projects all over the place,"" says Mr Nicholas, of green hydrogen initiatives, specifically.

Plus, there is a limit to how much steel-making can rely on electric arc furnaces since they currently largely rely on a supply of scrap steel.

A relatively low supply of scrap steel in China, versus demand, has slowed the rollout of electric arc furnaces there, according to some analyses.

These headaches would suggest that there is a niche for companies developing alternative ways of making iron and steel. Boston Metal is one.

""It looks a lot like how we make iron and steel today – it's a lot easier to conceive how that would get to scale [as a result],"" says Paul Kempler, an expert in electrochemistry and electrochemical engineering at the University of Oregon.

However, he notes that there are still challenges in ensuring that electrolysis systems like this don't corrode too quickly over time. Boston Metal says it hopes to have its first demonstration-scale steel plant operational by 2028.

Separately, the US firm Electra is taking a different approach to producing highly purified iron from ores. Unlike Boston Metal, Electra's process runs at a relatively low temperature, around 60-100C. First, iron ore is dissolved into an acidic solution and then an electrical charge causes the iron to collect onto metal plates. This is similar to the process currently used for making sheets of copper and zinc today.

""These plates are extracted automatically out of the solution and the iron is harvested,"" says Sandeep Nijhawan, co-founder and chief executive. A demonstration plant in Colorado, which could produce 500 tonnes of iron annually, is currently set to open next year.

Initially, iron produced in this manner would cost more than iron made using traditional techniques. But that ""green premium"" could fall away should the company be able to scale sufficiently, says Mr Nijhawan.

Mr Nicholas says that emerging technologies such as this are hopeful, but one challenge they face is in breaking into the market in a big way within just a few years, since the need to slash emissions and curb climate change is become more and more urgent: ""We're running short of time for addressing carbon emissions.""

Companies such as Electra and Boston Metal offer a completely different vision of the steel-making industry but they won't get far without further investment – and a market that appreciates what they are doing.

President Donald Trump's tariffs on steel imports to the US are supposedly designed to protect the domestic steel industry – and yet they risk raising the cost of steel substantially for US customers.

I ask whether Dr Rauwerdink, for one, is happy to see this move, or not. ""We're quite happy to see the strong focus on critical metals,"" he says, arguing the tariffs are ""beneficial"" for Boston Metal.

Though he acknowledges that US government's attitude towards renewable electricity, which Boston Metal says it want to prioritise as an energy source, has changed lately. And, globally, keeping the cost of renewable energy low is important for any firm hoping to electrify industries previously dominated by fossil fuels.

""The industry has growing pains there, for sure,"" he says.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1627/live/bc5613c0-7dd1-11f0-a34f-318be3fb0481.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 09:01:11.197371

Jeff Landry and Murrill’s joint prosecution agreements with trial lawyer and Democrat megadonor John Carmouche risk billions in new Louisiana energy investments.","It’s a dark day for Louisiana conservatives when the state’s top law enforcement officer takes up the mantle for the left’s climate lawfare agenda.

Attorney General Liz Murrill, elected with the promise of advancing President Donald Trump’s agenda, now sides with Democrat-aligned trial lawyers in an absurd campaign to pin the blame for Gulf Coast erosion on oil and gas producers operating in the state. In May, a local jury returned a $745 million verdict against Chevron that the attorney general’s office intervened in as a third-party plaintiff. And there are dozens of other similar cases pending.

The Louisiana land loss cases — now heading to the Supreme Court — are cut from the same cloth as the climate cases being litigated in deep blue states and municipalities across the country. Like those cases, the primary objective is extracting money, not fixing coastal erosion.

This isn’t “justice,” it’s a shakedown. Left-wing trial lawyers — pocketing huge contingency fees — target companies like Chevron in order to destroy the oil and gas industry in the United States. To do this, they are rewriting history by blaming industry for century-old, government-made problems. And Murrill is playing right along.

The true story of Louisiana’s coast isn’t one of corporate villainy; it’s the saga of the 1927 Mississippi River floods and the government’s response. After catastrophic floods, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built extensive levees and dikes to protect communities and farmland. This flood control infrastructure, necessary as it was, hampered the Mississippi’s natural delivery of silt to the delta — sediment crucial for replenishing barrier islands and wetlands lost to natural erosion.

How much sediment are we talking? In the late 1800s, as much as 750 million cubic feet of Mississippi silt reached the Gulf yearly — enough to bury a square mile under 27 feet of earth. These vital deposits were systematically reduced by federal leveeing. The scientific and historical reality is that without that silt, the coast subsides and erodes, independent of oil industry activity.

Multiple university studies and even prior lawsuits by Louisiana politicians blamed not Chevron, but the very federal government whose flood control policies turned the Mississippi from a land-building powerhouse into a silt-starved trickle.

In 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued a wartime executive order establishing the Petroleum Administration for War to help win World War II. Oil production dramatically increased in Louisiana to comply with the federal mandate maximizing petroleum production. The Louisiana State and Local Coastal Resources Management Act of 1980 further legitimized the wartime projects’ necessity and legitimacy, explicitly grandfathering them into the permitting process.

This bayou shakedown isn’t just legally suspect — it’s economically destructive. The oil and gas industry contributes $77.7 billion to the state's economy annually, representing 25% of the total gross domestic product, and the industry supports 306,750 jobs, accounting for 15% of the state's total employment. Tax revenue from the energy sector made up more than 20% — or $3.48 billion — of the state’s 2024 fiscal year budget, helping to fund public education, Medicaid, public safety and yes, environmental and natural resources.

The irony is biting. Less than a year after Chevron abandoned California’s punitive climate regime, the company faces echo-chamber litigation in the supposedly “red” state of Louisiana. Republican Gov. Jeff Landry and Murrill’s joint prosecution agreements with trial lawyer and Democrat megadonor John Carmouche risk billions in new Louisiana energy investments. Energy producers are not going to invest in projects that invite junk science lawsuits. But at least Landry has some good news: Carmouche donated $300,000 to his super PAC during his last campaign, and his law firm gave $25,000 to Murrill’s super PAC in 2024.

If these baseless lawsuits succeed, the only winners will be the left-wing trial lawyers and liberal moneyed interests who want to destroy American energy production — not the people of Louisiana, and certainly not the coastal communities in true need of real, science-based solutions.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/08/d086670a-73fd-11ec-95ce-1f1dd3d00486/610c63e44bcab.image.jpg?crop=1662%2C873%2C0%2C187&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-09-05 06:02:40.169320

Companies using Chinese-made solar inverters “must take the threat into account in their risk analyses and respond to the identified risks by implementing adequate security measures” as a result of the findings, under the Czech Cybersecurity Act.
The European Solar Manufacturing Council (ESMC), a trade group representing EU solar manufacturers, called on the European Commission to investigate the “risk potential for sabotage and espionage” and the ability of component manufacturers to “significantly influence” European grids.
The Lithuanian government has already limited the access of Chinese inverters to its solar and wind projects amid cybersecurity concerns.
Like most of the world, Europe is heavily reliant on Chinese-made renewable energy products, particularly for solar PV.","Infrastructure systems like energy grids, healthcare and transportation are increasingly dependent on cloud-based data storage and processing and remote control. NÚKIB said this means that the providers of those technology solutions “can significantly influence the operation of critical infrastructure and/or access important data, making trust in the reliability of the provider absolutely crucial.”

Those devices are increasingly connected to the Internet and can be controlled remotely by their manufacturers. The agency identified photovoltaic inverters as a high-risk product alongside large language models, electric vehicles, smart meters, medical technologies and personal devices like smart phones and watches.

NÚKIB cited “Confirmed malicious activities by actors linked to the PRC (People’s Republic of China) directed against the Czech Republic” as background for its concerns, including a “campaign” by the hacking group APT31.

It added that the “political and legal environment of the PRC… allows Chinese government authorities access to data stored on the territory of the PRC or significant interventions by Chinese government authorities in the operation of private companies.” This could raise questions about the security protocols of Chinese inverter producers. NÚKIB included Hong Kong and Macau in its risk assessment.

Companies using Chinese-made solar inverters “must take the threat into account in their risk analyses and respond to the identified risks by implementing adequate security measures” as a result of the findings, under the Czech Cybersecurity Act.

Inverter cybersecurity

Earlier this year, it was reported that US energy officials found “rogue” communication devices in Chinese-made solar inverters, which could have opened back-channels for data sharing with China or for hackers to bypass security measures.

The announcement sparked concern in Europe. The European Solar Manufacturing Council (ESMC), a trade group representing EU solar manufacturers, called on the European Commission to investigate the “risk potential for sabotage and espionage” and the ability of component manufacturers to “significantly influence” European grids.

The Lithuanian government has already limited the access of Chinese inverters to its solar and wind projects amid cybersecurity concerns.

SolarPower Europe, the continent’s leading trade body, has called for greater cybersecurity measures at the European level, especially as solar PV and other distributed energy resources take a larger portion of the energy mix.

Like most of the world, Europe is heavily reliant on Chinese-made renewable energy products, particularly for solar PV. Simultaneously, the continent’s inverter manufacturers are struggling against market headwinds and increased price competition from Asian supplier, something which SolarPower Europe has said needs to be addressed.",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Inverters-are-a-key-target-for-cyber-attacks.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 09:01:14.850204

The automaker will temporarily cease production of two electric Cadillac SUV models at its Spring Hill, Tennessee plant, US, in December, as informed by a source close to the matter and internal communications obtained by the news agency.

The Spring Hill factory is responsible for producing the Cadillac Lyriq, a top-selling midsize EV, and the Vistiq, a larger EV model.

Additionally, the sources said that GM anticipates a considerable reduction in the production of these vehicles for the first five months of 2026, which will involve temporary layoffs for one of the two worker shifts.

Furthermore, the automaker will close the plants for a week each in October and November.

Plans are also in place to “indefinitely” postpone the initiation of a second shift at a plant near Kansas City, which is expected to start producing the Chevy Bolt EV later in 2025.

When approached for a statement, GM told the publication that the company is “making strategic production adjustments in alignment with expected slower EV industry growth and customer demand by leveraging our flexible ICE (internal combustion engine) and EV manufacturing footprint.”

The withdrawal of significant incentives for EVs, such as the $7,500 consumer tax credit and the freezing of penalties for not meeting federal fuel efficiency standards, as enacted by the Trump administration’s tax and spending law in July, has led to a recalibration of expectations within the industry.

According to the publication, car executives anticipate a challenging period for EV sales following the expiration of the subsidy by the end of this month.

Despite the bullish forecasts for EV sales from a few years prior, the reality has been less optimistic, with many companies still incurring losses on electric models.

Advocates for green vehicles argue that federal support is crucial to expand adoption and keep the US competitive with Europe and China.

Option 2: 5 Percent Safe Harbor Historical 5 Percent Safe Harbor Rules The 5 Percent Safe Harbor requires taxpayers to pay (for cash-basis taxpayers) or incur (for accrual-basis taxpayers) 5 percent or more of the total cost of a qualified facility or energy property project.
Notice 2025-42 eliminates the ability to utilize the 5 Percent Safe Harbor for wind and solar facilities that begin construction on or after Sept. 2, 2025.","The IRS on Aug. 15, 2025, released Notice 2025-42, which provides guidance on how taxpayers can establish the ""beginning of construction"" (BOC) of a wind or solar facility for purposes of determining whether such facility is subject to credit termination provisions added to Internal Revenue Code Sections 45Y and 48E under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB).

Under the OBBB, wind and solar facilities must either 1) be placed in service by Dec. 31, 2027, or 2) BOC within one year after enactment of the OBBB (i.e., by July 3, 2026). The notice follows President Donald Trump's executive order (EO), issued on July 7, 2025, that required, among other things, the U.S. Department of the Treasury secretary to issue guidance for wind and solar facilities under Section 45Y (production tax credit, or PTC) and Section 48E (investment tax credit, or ITC) that it ""deems appropriate and consistent with applicable law to ensure that policies concerning 'beginning of construction' are not circumvented, including by preventing the artificial acceleration or manipulation of eligibility and by restricting the use of broad safe harbors unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built."" (See Holland & Knight's previous alert, ""Executive Order Requires Treasury Guidance on Wind, Solar and FEOC Rules for Energy Tax Credits,"" July 8, 2025.)

Generally, Notice 2025-42 makes the following changes to the historical BOC rules for wind and solar:

removes the 5 Percent Safe Harbor for all wind facilities and for solar facilities with net output of more than 1.5 megawatts of alternating current power (MW(ac))

retains the Physical Work Test with limited modifications

provides for a four-year continuity requirement safe harbor, thereby eliminating the 10-year continuity safe harbor for offshore wind projects and projects on federal lands

This Holland & Knight alert provides an overview of the historical BOC rules and how Notice 2025-42 modifies those rules for wind and solar facilities.

What Does the Notice Apply To?

Notice 2025-42 is effective for solar and wind facilities, the construction of which begins on or after Sept. 2, 2025. Notice 2025-42 applies only for purposes of determining whether construction of a wind or solar facility begins by July 3, 2026.

How Have the BOC Rules Changed?

Neither the Internal Revenue Code nor Treasury Department regulations provide guidance on what it means to BOC for tax purposes. Instead, the determination of whether construction began on a qualified facility or an energy property project for these purposes is made in accordance with a series of IRS notices (the BOC Notices).1

In the BOC Notices, the Treasury Department and IRS provide two methods that a taxpayer may use to establish the BOC of a qualified facility or energy property project: 1) begin physical work of a significant nature of that facility or property (Physical Work Test) or 2) pay or incur 5 percent or more of the cost of that facility or property (5 Percent Safe Harbor). Only one of these methods must be satisfied to establish BOC, and construction begins at the time at which either method is first satisfied.

Option 1: Physical Work Test

Historical Physical Work Test Rules

The Physical Work Test requires taxpayers to begin physical work of a significant nature on a qualified facility. Generally, work performed by the taxpayer and work performed for the taxpayer by other persons (under a binding written contract that is entered into before the work begins) is taken into account to determine whether construction has begun. That work can be undertaken on-site or off-site. Notably, this test focuses on the nature of the work performed, not the amount or cost.

Generally, if the work performed is of a significant nature, there is no fixed minimum amount of work or monetary or percentage threshold required to satisfy the physical work test. Though the BOC Notices do not define the term ""significant nature,"" based on the nonexclusive list of certain on-site and off-site activities that could be treated as physical work of a significant nature, the BOC Notices make clear that qualifying work may not be de minimis for purposes of establishing BOC via the Physical Work Test.2 Further, the BOC Notices exclude preliminary activities as well as other work performed by the taxpayer (or by another person under a binding written contract) to produce components of energy property projects that are held in inventory by a vendor from constituting satisfaction of the physical work test.

The Physical Work Test includes a ""continuity requirement,"" which historically requires that a taxpayer make continuous efforts or continuous progress toward completion once construction has begun. Whether a taxpayer makes continuous efforts or continuous progress to satisfy this continuity requirement will be determined by the facts and circumstances. Notably, a taxpayer can satisfy the continuity requirement by placing the project in service by the end of the year that includes the fourth anniversary of the date in which construction began (the Continuity Safe Harbor) – e.g., by Dec. 31, 2029, for a project for which construction began during 2025.

What's Changed in the Physical Work Test?

Notice 2025-42 did not generally modify the historical rules under the Physical Work Test. However, Notice 2025-42 1) does not include the 10-year Continuity Safe Harbor for offshore wind projects and projects built on federal land that were included in previous BOC Notices and 2) alters the continuity requirement by referring only to a continuous progress toward completion and not to continuous efforts.

Option 2: 5 Percent Safe Harbor

Historical 5 Percent Safe Harbor Rules

The 5 Percent Safe Harbor requires taxpayers to pay (for cash-basis taxpayers) or incur (for accrual-basis taxpayers) 5 percent or more of the total cost of a qualified facility or energy property project.

For these purposes, all costs properly included in the depreciable basis of the qualified facility or energy property project (which do not include the cost of land or any property not integral to the facility or project) are taken into account to determine whether the 5 Percent Safe Harbor has been met.

Taxpayers can rely on the economic performance rules under Section 461 of the Internal Revenue Code and Treasury Department regulations for incurring costs for federal income tax purposes. Under these rules, a taxpayer can treat property as provided to the taxpayer when the taxpayer pays the person providing the property, if the taxpayer reasonably expects the property to be provided within three and a half months after the date of the payment (the ""three-and-a-half-month rule""). Taxpayers relying on the three-and-a-half-month rule should seek to put guardrails in place to make sure economic performance occurs (for example, the property is actually received by the taxpayer) within three and a half months from the date of payment.

The 5 Percent Safe Harbor also includes the ""continuity requirement,"" which requires that a taxpayer make continuous efforts or continuous progress toward completion once construction has begun. As with the Physical Work Test, whether a taxpayer makes continuous efforts or continuous progress to satisfy this continuity requirement will be determined by the facts and circumstances, but a taxpayer can satisfy the continuity requirement through the Continuity Safe Harbor.

What's Changed in the 5 Percent Safe Harbor?

Notice 2025-42 eliminates the ability to utilize the 5 Percent Safe Harbor for wind and solar facilities that begin construction on or after Sept. 2, 2025. One exception is for solar facilities if the net output (in nameplate capacity) of such facility is less than 1.5 MW(ac). For purposes of the 1.5 MW(ac) determination, solar facilities with ""integrated operations"" are measured in the aggregate. Taxpayers must aggregate operations with one or more other solar facilities that are 1) owned by the same taxpayer, 2) placed in service in the same taxable year and 3) connected to the same interconnection point.

Notice 2025-42 also eliminates the rule with respect to the 5 Percent Safe Harbor that a taxpayer can make ""continuous efforts"" toward completing the project once construction has begun. Now, taxpayers must demonstrate a continuous program of construction that involves continuing physical work of a significant nature. Though Notice 2025-42 retains a list of excusable disruptions for purposes of satisfying the Continuity Safe Harbor, the list of disruptions does not apply for purposes of satisfying the continuity requirement. Finally, as noted above for the Physical Work Test, Notice 2025-42 does not include the special 10-year Continuity Safe Harbor for offshore wind projects and projects built on federal land that was included in previous BOC Notices.

These projects focus on reclaiming AML, decreasing abandoned mine drainage (AMD) and treating AMD through the construction, operation, and/or maintenance of treatment facilities.
Apply Now For Grants DEP is now accepting applications for the next round of localAbandoned Mine Reclamation and Drainage Treatment Grants.
(formal notice) Eligible applicants include a county or municipality, conservation district, council of government, municipal authority and nonprofit organizations.","Grants were awarded in Elk, Fayette, Indiana, Northumberland, Schuylkill, Washington and Westmoreland counties.

Pennsylvania has the largest inventory of abandoned coal mines in the nation, with a roughly $5 billion need for reclamation and stream restoration.

To date, Pennsylvania has rehabilitated approximately 159,000 acres of abandoned mine land across the Commonwealth, and with this federal funding, will be able to continue this vital work that protects the health and safety of our communities.

“Abandoned mine lands leave scars across Pennsylvania. Reclaiming these areas is an important part of the work DEP does to restore the environment and protect the communities in the Commonwealth, all while simultaneously creating jobs and bolstering the economy,” said DEP Secretary Jessica Shirley. “These grant recipients are taking on projects to pave the way for meaningful efforts in improving water quality, fostering ecosystem recovery, and revitalizing communities for a greater quality of life for Pennsylvanians.”

The funding was awarded through the federal Bipartisan Infrastructure, Investment, and Jobs Act, which has invested more than $700 million into reclaiming Pennsylvania’s abandoned mine lands since 2022.

In addition to planned projects, this funding also pays for emergency situations like mine subsidence and sinkholes that can endanger people and damage or destroy homes and property.

Funding for the program was frozen by the Trump Administration in early 2025, but thanks to the efforts of Governor Josh Shapiro, grant funding has continued uninterrupted. Read more here.

These projects focus on reclaiming AML, decreasing abandoned mine drainage (AMD) and treating AMD through the construction, operation, and/or maintenance of treatment facilities.

DEP prioritizes grant funding to address serious human health and safety problems resulting from abandoned coal mines, as well as treating AMD to continue watershed restoration efforts under the AMD Set-Aside Program and prevent the loss of restored streams.

""These funds will be vital to help communities that face challenges due to their size or financial resources provide safe drinking water to their residents.""","The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (Illinois EPA) has unveiled a new funding initiative aimed at tackling emerging contaminants in drinking and source water within small or disadvantaged communities.

Acting Director James Jennings announced that the Emerging Contaminants in Small or Disadvantaged Communities (EC-SDC) Grant Program will allocate over $40 million to support construction projects addressing Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) and manganese.

A Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) has been posted on the Illinois EPA website, detailing the program's focus on communities listed in the Illinois EPA’s Public Water Supply Loan Program Emerging Contaminant Intended Funding Lists for fiscal years 2025 and 2026. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) identifies these emerging contaminants through its Contaminant Candidate Lists (CCL) 1-5.

PFAS, a group of man-made chemicals, are known for their persistence in the environment and have been linked to various health issues, including an increased risk of certain cancers. Manganese, a naturally occurring mineral, can lead to neurological and cognitive problems when present in high levels in drinking water.

""Both PFAS and manganese are significant issues for drinking water systems throughout the state, and small and disadvantaged communities often lack sufficient resources to address these emerging contaminants,"" said Acting Director Jennings. ""These funds will be vital to help communities that face challenges due to their size or financial resources provide safe drinking water to their residents.""

The funding, sourced from the State and Tribal Assistance Grant (STAG) appropriated by Congress, will be distributed based on project funding needs, with a cap of $15 million per applicant. Eligible expenses include design engineering, construction engineering, and construction costs incurred after January 1, 2025.

Consumption of biodiesel and renewable diesel is expected to pick up later in 2025 to meet Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) obligations.
Forecasts suggest that U.S. net biodiesel imports in 2025 and 2026 will be the lowest since 2012.","U.S. imports of biodiesel and renewable diesel fell sharply in the first half of 2025, reaching their lowest levels in more than a decade. The decline comes after changes to federal tax credits and reduced domestic consumption of the fuels, reports EIA.

Government data show that biodiesel imports averaged just 2,000 barrels per day (b/d) between January and June 2025, compared with 35,000 b/d in the same period last year. Renewable diesel imports also dropped, averaging 5,000 b/d compared with 33,000 b/d in the first half of 2024.

The steep decline follows the end of the $1-per-gallon blender’s tax credit, which previously applied to both domestic and imported fuels. From January 2025, the Inflation Reduction Act replaced the credit with the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, which is limited to U.S.-produced biofuels. The change left imported products at a disadvantage.

Falling demand added further pressure. U.S. consumption of renewable diesel fell by about 30% in early 2025 compared with a year earlier, while biodiesel use dropped by around 40%. Analysts point to weak blending margins and uncertainty around regulatory requirements.

As a result, domestic blenders turned to U.S.-produced fuels for the limited amounts being used. Neste, the sole supplier of renewable diesel imports to the U.S., reported sending a smaller share of its output to the country this year.

Consumption of biodiesel and renewable diesel is expected to pick up later in 2025 to meet Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) obligations. However, imports are likely to remain low because of the tax policy changes. Forecasts suggest that U.S. net biodiesel imports in 2025 and 2026 will be the lowest since 2012.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/biodiesel-bio-energy.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 07:00:26.980009

Steven Bischoff sbischoff@hondiuscapital.com (203) 930-2200","CHARLOTTE, N.C., Sept. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Terrestrial Energy Inc. (“Terrestrial Energy” or “the Company”), a developer of small modular nuclear power plants using its Generation IV reactor technology, today announced the opening of its new corporate headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina. The new office represents a significant milestone in Terrestrial Energy's growth trajectory and affirms the Company’s commitment to U.S. nuclear supply chains as a central strategy for the rapid deployment of its Integral Molten Salt Reactor (IMSR) plants across key U.S. industrial sectors. Terrestrial Energy is committed to the delivery of cost-competitive high-temperature, clean, firm thermal and electric energy supply that is essential to power the reshoring of U.S. manufacturing and AI leadership.

Terrestrial Energy’s U.S.-anchored supply chain, stretching across many U.S. States, mitigates trade uncertainties by reducing reliance on foreign suppliers. From its new North Carolina base of operations, the company is positioned to leverage America's nuclear ecosystem and expert workforce in the nuclear, oil and gas, and heavy industrial sectors for supply of key nuclear components and systems, together with engineering services, for IMSR plant construction and project management in the delivery of commissioned plants.

The Company’s focus on a domestically-secured supply chain, inclusive of North Carolina supplier partnerships, and its use of Standard-Assay Low Enriched Uranium (LEU) fuels – as opposed to supply-restricted High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU) – is a distinguishing feature of the Terrestrial Energy’s strategy to deliver a nuclear energy solution to the U.S. market that is policy-resilient and cost-certain. Terrestrial Energy is sourcing key electric power components, including power transformers and steam turbines, from global energy technology leader Siemens, a long-standing North Carolina employer with eight locations across the state. Siemens and Terrestrial Energy have been engaged on IMSR plant component supply since 2021.

“Terrestrial Energy’s new headquarters will be driving the development of our IMSR plant and its supply chain, while advancing our leadership in the U.S. advanced nuclear reactor sector,” said Simon Irish, CEO of Terrestrial Energy. “This is an extraordinary time for the nuclear sector, and as the United States seeks energy dominance, it offers an unmatched environment for nuclear energy innovation. North Carolina’s business and energy leadership provides the perfect anchor to expand our domestic operations.”

“Terrestrial Energy’s decision to grow in Charlotte underscores the South’s leadership in advanced nuclear,” said Kenneth J. Nemeth, Secretary and Executive Director of the Southern States Energy Board. “As an organization with roots in nuclear energy, SSEB welcomes the company’s investment in our region. As an SSEB Associate Member, Terrestrial Energy is strengthening domestic supply chains, creating high-value jobs, and advancing clean, reliable power for the industries that drive our member states’ economies.”

Today’s announcement comes amidst a period of accelerating growth for Terrestrial Energy, following a critical materials testing milestone in partnership with NRG PALLAS, as well as a recently-signed MOU with leading energy solutions provider Ameresco, Inc. to develop customized hybrid energy systems. Earlier this year, Terrestrial Energy announced plans to site an Integral Molten Salt Reactor (IMSR) plant at the Texas A&M-RELLIS campus as part of a powerful hub to drive advanced nuclear innovation in Texas and the United States.

About Terrestrial Energy

Terrestrial Energy is a developer of Generation IV nuclear plants that use its proprietary Integral Molten Salt Reactor (IMSR). The IMSR captures the full transformative operating benefits of molten salt reactor technology in a plant design that represents true innovation in cost reduction, versatility and functionality of nuclear energy supply. IMSR plants are designed to be small and modular for distributed supply of zero-carbon, reliable, dispatchable, low-cost, high-temperature industrial heat and electricity, and for a dual-use energy role relevant to many industrial applications, such as chemical synthesis and data center operation. In so doing, they extend the application of nuclear energy far beyond electric power markets. Their deployment will support the rapid global decarbonization of the primary energy system across a broad spectrum and increase its sustainability. Terrestrial Energy uses an innovative plant design together with proven and demonstrated molten salt reactor technology and standard nuclear fuel for a nuclear plant with a unique set of operating characteristics and compelling commercial potential. Terrestrial Energy is engaged with regulators, suppliers and industrial partners to build, license and commission the first IMSR plants in the early 2030s.

Ten pro-renewables siting laws passed versus seven that are expected to restrict clean energy.
Still, the flood of new anti-renewables legislation underscores the increasingly hostile policy environment for clean energy.
Such policies are becoming more common around the U.S., the Sabin Center finds, a fact that is not surprising given shrinking public approval for large clean energy projects.
Right now, with Trump’s all-out campaign against clean energy at their back, opponents of renewables have the momentum.","See more from Canary Media’s ​“Chart of the week” column.

State legislatures saw a torrent of anti-clean energy bills introduced this year — and little more than a trickle of measures that would benefit renewables. Fortunately, most of the legislation was not signed into law.

As of June, with most states’ legislative sessions wrapped up for the year, 305 bills related to the siting of new clean energy developments had been introduced across 47 states, according to a new report from Clean Tomorrow, a policy-focused nonprofit. Of those, 148 would likely have made it harder to build renewables, while just 68 would have helped wind, solar, or battery storage projects move forward. The remaining 89 would have had a neutral or unclear impact.

The vast majority of these bills stalled out, and of the few that were signed into law, slightly more were favorable to clean energy than hostile to it. Ten pro-renewables siting laws passed versus seven that are expected to restrict clean energy.

Still, the flood of new anti-renewables legislation underscores the increasingly hostile policy environment for clean energy.

Already, 16 states have significant restrictions on new solar, wind, and battery projects, and 459 counties and municipalities across 44 states have restrictions of their own, per a June 2025 report from the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. These restrictive policies range from giving local officials more authority over permitting decisions to imposing onerous setback requirements on projects, which prevent solar or wind from being built within a certain distance of, say, a road or a property line.

Such policies are becoming more common around the U.S., the Sabin Center finds, a fact that is not surprising given shrinking public approval for large clean energy projects. Support for expanding solar farms fell from 66% to 52% between September 2022 and this past June, per an AP/NORC poll; pro-solar sentiment declined most among independents and Democrats over that period.

Still, some Democrat-led states are boosting policy support for clean energy deployment — most notably Colorado. Even in deep-red Ohio, the governor signed into law a bipartisan, tech-neutral bill that is expected to make it modestly easier to build clean energy.

States and municipalities have significant power to advance clean energy, even without the federal government. They also have the ability to stifle it, making state and local government a crucial arena for the energy transition. Right now, with Trump’s all-out campaign against clean energy at their back, opponents of renewables have the momentum.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/canary-media-social-share.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=bcafcbb5c2093505c132e608a191b0b0,N,,2025-09-05 05:00:58.104206
