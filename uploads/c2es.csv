Dampening a solar boom The use of rooftop panels by Republicans illustrates the growing economic appeal of solar energy, industry data shows.","“It never was supposed to be permanent,” Calvert said of the credits — a line echoed by other Republicans who criticized renewable energy as unreliable and dependent on subsidies. The law that Trump called his “one big beautiful bill” passed Congress with no Democratic votes and the support of all but five Republicans.

E&E News examined the rooftops of 112 members of Congress: every Senate Republican and 59 House GOP lawmakers who are in leadership or facing tough reelection races.

The search found that at least seven Republican lawmakers had rooftop panels. Three of them acknowledged using the federal tax credit to help pay for the arrays. One couldn’t recall. Another had leased a solar system that was indirectly subsidized via a separate tax credit for installers. And two other lawmakers didn’t respond to questions about their panels, which were on properties they had recently owned.

In addition to Calvert, the other Republican lawmakers who are known to have collected the residential solar credit are Sen. John Curtis of Utah and Rep. Tom Massie of Kentucky, a libertarian who voted against Trump’s megalaw but said in an interview he supports rescinding the solar subsidy — and all tax credits. Curtis said Democrats and solar companies “knew that it was time for the subsidies to go.”

The revelations come at a time of rising utility rates and increasing politicization of energy as the Trump administration scraps grants, loans and permits for solar, wind and other renewable energy technologies. The president has dismissed solar panels as part of Democrats’ “green new scam” and called them “a blight on our country.”

Trump’s megalaw reinforced the partisan divide on energy. While the legislation primarily extended tax cuts passed in the president’s first term and provided $300 billion for border enforcement and military programs, it also slashed over $484 billion in clean energy incentives. Despite the megalaw’s deep cuts for climate programs, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that it would add $3.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade.

The law was a double-whammy for the solar industry. It speeds up the phase-out of both the rooftop solar subsidy tapped by Calvert, Curtis and Massie as well as another credit relied on by project developers to cut the price of leased panels. At the same time, it boosted an oil subsidy created in the early 1900s and included other provisions to increase the production of fossil fuels that are primarily responsible for global warming.

“There has been a push, as you know, for a long while to get rid of those tax credits,” said Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, whose Capitol Hill rowhouse roof has been layered with solar panels for about a decade. “And then when you had Trump come into office, he made it very clear that this was not something that he was going to continue supporting.”

A key swing vote on the megalaw, Murkowski couldn’t recall if she received the credit, which can save homeowners thousands of dollars by refunding 30 percent of the cost of buying and installing panels. Analysts say almost everyone who buys a new solar system — the average cost of which is now about $30,000 — files for the benefit.

Rise and fall of solar subsidies

Congress first established a tax credit for some residential solar investments in 1978, but the subsidy expired in 1985.

The tax credit was revived in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 — a sweeping law signed by President George W. Bush that Murkowski and Calvert voted for at the time.

In the years since, the so-called residential clean energy credit has been extended and broadened in scope several times, most recently when Democrats passed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022 with no Republican votes. The clean energy spending package would have allowed homeowners to claim tax credits of between 22 and 30 percent of the cost of qualifying solar, wind, geothermal and battery projects through 2034.

Then on July 4, Trump signed the megalaw that moved up the expiration of the residential clean energy credit by nearly a decade.

The legislation also accelerated the end of a 30 percent investment tax credit that’s used by solar installers to lower the cost of leasing panels for their customers. That solar credit will now largely disappear at the end of 2027, at least five years earlier than it would have.

New York Rep. Mike Lawler lives in a suburban home in the Hudson River Valley with rooftop panels that he leases from Vivint Solar. His district narrowly supported former Vice President Kamala Harris in the last presidential election, making him one of the most vulnerable Republicans in Congress.

Lawler was among a group of GOP lawmakers who repeatedly urged House leaders to protect clean energy subsidies when the party was overhauling the tax code this year. Those efforts were largely unsuccessful, and Lawler voted for the bill.

“We didn’t get everything we wanted, but we were able to keep a lot of the provisions and labor standards, etc.,” he said in an interview.

The panels on Lawler’s house have helped him avoid the impacts of rising electricity costs. Since he began leasing the solar system in 2016, it has saved him “a few thousand bucks,” he estimated.

“Look, they were going to expire,” Lawler said of the solar subsidies. “And it was phased out — a little more accelerated than some would like — but people are still able to utilize them.”

Lawler indirectly benefited from the investment tax credit, analysts say, because it helps companies reduce the costs their customers pay for leasing rooftop solar systems. After 2027, when the investment tax credit disappears, it could be harder for people to lease panels or buy electricity from community solar projects, according to Zoë Gaston, an analyst at the consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.

“Solar will definitely be more expensive,” she said. “It could be as much as a 30 percent increase. I know from talking to lots of installers that they’re trying to find other opportunities to cut costs.”

California Reps. Darrell Issa and Young Kim, both Republicans who voted for the megalaw, also had solar panels on homes they once owned. Public records show Issa sold his property last year. Kim transferred hers to a family trust in 2024 that now operates it as a rental property. She is facing a primary from Calvert.

Their offices did not respond to questions about whether the lawmakers had taken advantage of federal subsidies to purchase or lease the panels.

Dampening a solar boom

The use of rooftop panels by Republicans illustrates the growing economic appeal of solar energy, industry data shows.

A renewable energy trade group estimated in 2004 that the nation installed enough panels that year to produce a total of 58 megawatts of power, enough for about 8,000 homes. Installations have exploded in popularity since then. Last year, the U.S. added over 50 gigawatts of solar capacity — 865 times higher than 2004 levels — with 4.8 GW of that annual growth coming from the residential sector alone, according to solar industry data. Seven percent of U.S. homes now have solar systems.

The megalaw is likely to blunt the solar boom as it amplifies other challenges facing the industry, such as high interest rates and Trump’s tariffs, according to analysts. Three large companies have already filed for bankruptcy protection this year, with more expected to become insolvent in the coming months. Wood Mackenzie estimates that solar installations over the next decade would be 17 percent lower than it had previously forecast.

Curtis and Murkowski both argued that phasing out solar subsidies was necessary.

“I think universally, everybody — including our Democratic colleagues, including the industry — knew that it was time for the subsidies to go,” said Curtis, who along with Murkowski shaped the megalaw to make it slightly less difficult for companies to access the investment tax credit before it ends. “Nobody fought harder than I did for the off-ramp for those, because I felt like the off-ramp was appropriate.”

Democrats and solar companies disagreed with Curtis. Abigail Ross Hopper, the head of the Solar Energy Industries Association, warned on July 1 that the compromise legislation he and Murkowski had brokered “will strip the ability of millions of American families to choose the energy savings, energy resilience, and energy freedom that solar and storage provide.”

Curtis founded the Conservative Climate Caucus in 2021 while he was serving in the House. Two years later, he invited a climate media company to tour his home in Provo, Utah, where he showed off his solar panels and geothermal heat pump, while bragging about the hundreds of dollars per month they helped him save in energy costs. The panels and heat pump were both eligible for the residential tax credit he voted to terminate.

Back on Capitol Hill, Murkowski said her husband decided to install panels on their rowhouse about a decade ago. The senator, who once chaired the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, couldn’t recall if they had filed for the federal tax credit.

“He was a real skeptic of solar and solar panels, more specifically, because he didn’t think that they were really going to make a difference for him as a consumer, as an individual,” Murkowski said, referring to her husband, Verne Martell.

What changed his mind, she said, was seeing the electricity savings of his then-87-year-old mother, who has solar panels on her home in Maui, Hawaii.

“It was an education for him that allowed him to do more research about how it might work in Washington, D.C.,” Murkowski said. “I do like the fact that our utility bills are really manageable now. And you know, it took a while, but it paid off.”

New fossil fuel subsidies

Republicans’ justification for killing rooftop solar credits are undercut by their continued support for incentives that go to the fossil fuel industry, argued Jesse Lee, a former senior adviser to the National Economic Council during the Biden administration.

“We’ve had subsidies and tax credits for oil production for more than a century. So I don’t really understand this argument that all clean energy tax credits must come to an end,” said Lee, who is now a spokesperson for the environmental advocacy group Climate Power.

“And not only did they leave the century-old oil industry subsidies untouched, they gave new tax loopholes to the oil industry,” he added. For instance, the megalaw established a 2.5 percent production tax credit for steel-making coal, cut royalty rates for coal mining and oil drilling on federal land, and eased restrictions on tax deductions for oil drilling costs — a subsidy that dates back to 1913.

Murkowski wasn’t comfortable with the megalaw’s energy contradictions.

“It’s kind of putting your finger on the scale, if you will, and picking winners and losers in the energy space,” she said. “I don’t think we should do that.”

But overall, she thought the bill was “more positive than negative in a lot of different areas,” she said. Murkowski was one of the final Republican holdouts on the bill, which passed the Senate with a tiebreaking vote by Vice President JD Vance.

Massie, whose Kentucky farmhouse appears to have more solar panels than the homes of his GOP colleagues, was one of only two House Republicans to oppose the megalaw. He voted against it because he thought the bill didn’t go far enough in cutting energy and health care subsidies.

“I would end all the tax credits. For everything,” said Massie, who earned a master’s degree in mechanical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and has enough solar and battery systems to live off the grid. “I bought the bulk of mine before the federal tax credit.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fd7%2F41%2Fb41a2dcd46419e20c32ff86c2217%2Fmain-ee-solarcredits-new.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 12:02:33.956543

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a broad package of federal spending and tax policies signed into law in July 2025, spells trouble for the residential solar industry. The law ends a large subsidy for residential consumers at year-end 2025.

It will also alter the broad distribution of tax benefits and the geographic dispersal of solar resources, though these changes will appear over time. While residential solar is very visible to the public, utility-scale solar dominates the overall market.

Tax subsidies supported solar expansion

Solar power’s expansion across much of the world coincided with government subsidies. Tax credits were the favored method of supporting solar energy in the U.S. Generally, an individual or business investing in solar energy could receive a tax credit equal to some percentage of the outlay.

The provision covered both residential installations and industrial development. After installing solar panels, residential consumers could claim a residential solar tax credit when they filed their taxes.

The residential solar tax credit is not new, and debate about the subsidy’s existence and its form have persisted since a Carter administration-backed measure created the first tax credit for solar system installation in 1978. The provision expired in 1985 under the Reagan administration and returned when President George W. Bush signed The Energy Policy Act into law nearly 20 years later, re-establishing the residential tax credit for solar energy.

It has endured in some form ever since, with extensions and marginal changes over the years. Under the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law in August 2022, the residential credit for solar energy investment increased to 30 percent of qualified investment costs, up from 26 percent. The provision was to begin phasing out after 2032.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed within the first six months of the second Trump administration, removed tax credit eligibility for any system placed in service after Dec. 31. It will also mark the end of two decades during which a tax credit has been in place.

Residential solar credit often excludes low-income households

Although available to all households, solar tax credits don’t get much take-up among low-income households. The average cost of a household solar system is a little over $29,000. Assuming the installation fully qualifies for the 30 percent tax credit in 2025, the net-cost of the solar system would be roughly $20,000 ($29,000 sticker price minus the $8,700 credit).

Low-income households do not commonly have $29,000 in available cash (apart from the tax credit) for the up-front cost of installation. Even if they did, these households are more likely to rent rather than own their housing, which means they often do not have the option to install solar panels even if they had the money (Chart 1).

Thus, high income earners receive most of the benefit from the residential clean energy credit (Chart 2). Just under 1.25 million tax returns had residential energy credit attached in the 2023 tax year. The credit claimed that year totaled $6.3 billion.

About two-thirds of all credited dollars went to those reporting more than $100,000 in annual income. This group represents only around 24 percent of tax filers.

The form of the tax credit is another limiting factor for low-income households that might opt for a solar system. The credit is not fully refundable—that is, it cannot exceed the taxpayer’s annual tax liability.

The $8,700 solar tax credit in this example would exceed the annual tax bill for many low-income households. To obtain a credit, such a taxpayer would need to either spread the credit over several years or install a smaller system, lowering the present value of a full solar tax credit relative to an upper-income household that could take the entire credit at once.

Energy consumption skews toward high-incomes households

The distribution of energy consumption by income level often isn’t included in the analysis of who benefits from the residential energy tax credit.

While distribution of benefits from residential energy tax credits favors upper-income households, those groups also consume more energy than their low-income counterparts (Chart 3).

Insofar that reduced grid demand is a beneficial byproduct of residential solar systems, a policy whose distribution skews toward upper-income households might reduce grid stress more relative to a flat subsidy. However, solar panels also induce demand for energy consumption.

Solar panels, by subsidizing a household’s variable energy costs, incentivize those same households to consume more. This might come in the form of purchasing an electric vehicle or through other household electrification, such as switching to electric cook tops and heating or purchasing additional appliances. There is reason to believe that although residential solar has net-reduction effects on grid consumption, residential solar does not one-for-one displace grid consumption.

The raw distribution of residential tax credit masks its complicated effects. While high-income households disproportionately benefit from residential tax credits, they also disproportionately contribute to grid demand.

Residential consumption makes up small overall share

Even though residential solar installations might be the most visible form of solar energy, these systems contribute a small (and shrinking) fraction of solar investment.

The residential segment accounted for just more than 20 percent of solar installations in 2015. The share shrank to just over 17 percent in 2024. The decline reflects, in part, maturation and economies of scale for the solar industry, which has made utility-scale developments more competitive.

For example, a typical home solar system might have an 8 kilowatt to 12 kilowatt capacity, while a typical utility-scale solar farm of 150 megawatts is more than 10,000 times larger and is assembled at a steep per-unit discount on construction cost.

Residential solar also is not always the most economically efficient use of the marginal solar resource, since many areas in the country, such as Washington state, do not receive nearly the level of sun that Texas and Arizona do. The residential solar tax credit, by offering the same cost-based subsidy independent of geography, caused deployment of solar resources in suboptimal solar resource areas (Chart 4).

For instance, when a Seattle homeowner reviews the cost and benefit of a solar system, the subsidy significantly affects the break-even calculation. In a less subsidized environment, solar panels need to produce much more sunlight or utility savings to make sense for residential consumers. That is not always possible for someone living in a low-sunlight area such as Seattle.

Fewer home panels doesn’t mean less solar

While a full repeal of the residential energy tax credit likely leads to a decrease in residential installations, the growth of utility-scale projects will at least partially offset the impact, particularly with the future siting of marginal panels more likely in higher sunlight areas.

This moment of change in the solar industry will likely more progressively distribute benefits under the remaining tax credit system, all else equal. The residential share of development will shrink because of One Big Beautiful Bill Act provisions.

However, utility-scale developers will have an easier time surviving the act’s impacts because of better project economics and a more favorable subsidy expiration schedule that in some cases runs until 2027.

Finally, the marginal solar resource will likely concentrate further toward areas of the country with greater sunlight. The lack of a broad subsidy will cause remaining developers and customers to tilt further toward the most solar-rich areas to get the most out of their panels.",https://www.dallasfed.org/-/media/Images/research/economics/2025/1120/neighborhood-solar-panels-pri.png,N,,2025-11-20 12:02:29.272463

Beyond equipment, Baker Hughes has also committed strategic capital, becoming an investor in the project — a move that signals confidence from one of the most established technology players in the global gas market.

The agreement was formalized during a high-level event in Washington, D.C., attended by federal officials including Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Energy Secretary Chris Wright. Both emphasized the role of Alaska LNG in U.S. energy resilience and global energy strategy, positioning it as a project of both economic and geopolitical significance.

By integrating proven LNG technologies rather than introducing untested systems, Glenfarne reduces technical risk and advances toward final investment decision (FID) with a stronger platform. The company has already made notable progress since taking the lead in March, including early commercial traction with buyers across Asia — an area where shipping advantages could give Alaska a competitive edge over Gulf Coast terminals.

Two-Phase Strategy Sets Clear Path to Market

Glenfarne is pursuing a phased construction plan designed to move faster than previous attempts at development. In Phase One, an 807-mile, 42-inch natural gas pipeline would link Alaska’s North Slope resources to in-state users and the eventual LNG terminal. Final engineering and cost analysis from Worley are expected by December, with FID anticipated soon after.

Phase Two adds a full-scale liquefaction and export facility capable of shipping up to 20 million tons per annum (MTPA) of LNG to international markets. That component is targeting a late-2026 FID. Glenfarne has already secured preliminary commitments from buyers in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand, which collectively represent over 60% of the volume needed to greenlight the project.

The structure aligns with evolving market realities, enabling capital deployment in stages and increasing project bankability. It also reflects Glenfarne’s broader LNG footprint across North America — including permitted sites in Louisiana and Texas — giving the company a diversified platform to serve global demand from multiple basins.",https://cdn1.creativecirclemedia.com/environment/original/20251114-090753-acd-getty-images-xQLb4F23jdM-unsplash.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 12:03:53.561880

CleanTechnica is all for renewables and electrification.

We exist to remind humans of the Earth and to rid it of smoke belchers, offensive energy generation, and climate deniers. Idealistic as we are, we are also grounded in the truth that this will never happen quickly enough, and will happen mostly out of necessity.

And if you read the stories here, we question, oftentimes lambast, sometimes expose, but mostly praise and give credit where credit is due. I just have to say this to set the tone for this piece.

When I received the latest unaudited reports from VinFast last September, I asked them if I could get an audited report before I started writing my opinion on VinFast and where it is going—at least in the market where it intended to grow the fastest and the biggest—right here in the USA. Elsewhere in the world, they are seeping (that’s the word) into the market. Intentionally slow, I guess. But never overly cautious.

The reports never arrived, but that won’t stop a story. And it seems nothing will stop VinFast’s push into the US, a push recently highlighted by its aggressive presence at major events like the Electrify Expo, a vital step in re-establishing the brand after some missteps, which includes bad press on the VF8.

Now, I found two reasons to write this piece: 1) the residual value program the company is running in the Philippines and Indonesia; 2) and even more profoundly, space exploration.

Yes, VinGroup is now looking at the heavens for expansion, investing in a new company called VinSpace Joint Stock Company. According to Reuters, who broke the story, the new VND300 billion ($11,840,000) venture will be involved in space-related activities, specifically telecommunication satellite operations and scientific research.

Doesn’t that sound like burning cash?

Recently, CleanTechnica revisited their plant in Vietnam for the third time and compared notes between 2022 and 2025. There is great progress in manufacturing, research, and development back in Vietnam. This wasn’t just progress; it was transformative, at the very least.

Not financial advice

I am not a finance guy, so this story was developed with a lot of help from an auditor friend (whose name I cannot mention) to make me understand what the rows and columns of numbers imply. The numbers themselves were staggering, but two distinct impressions came to mind to me as a non-finance guy.

First, my thought is: this company is crazy. This level of financial risk is matched only by their history of audacity. I have covered the brand since 2017 when they held a contest to present to the Vietnamese people designs for the new national car, which was later to become the Lux A2.0 and Lux SA 2.0.

Imagine that. Instead of just getting a few heads together in the design phase, they elicited the help of the whole nation, with 60,000 citizens casting votes.

I realized that over time, the company was losing money at such a breathtaking pace that any other car company would have executives exiting or scrambling for solutions. VinFast executives seem to be sleeping just fine.

I asked a finance expert friend and journalist to tell me what the Vietnamese automaker’s latest unaudited financial report means. He said if we look at it historically, it is simply good investing. He pointed out how Tesla suffered losses too, both capital and operational. He framed the reports as a masterclass in strategic spending: take enormous losses now to dominate the global EV market later.

Wild, Wild East

The current numbers tell a wild story. (Note: not audited, not updated since September 10, 2025.)

VinFast delivered 72,167 EVs in the first half of 2025—a staggering 223% jump from the same period last year. Add in their e-scooters and e-bikes, and they’re moving serious volume: 114,484 two-wheelers delivered, up 447% year-over-year. Revenue hit $663 million in the second quarter alone, nearly doubling from last year. With 394 showrooms now spread across the globe, it’s the kind of operational breakthrough that should have investors celebrating.

The most recent press release said “VinFast continues to break records in the domestic automotive market by successfully delivering 20,380 electric cars of various models in October 2025, bringing the total number of VinFast vehicles delivered nationwide to 124,264 units in the first 10 months of the year.”

Those figures are real.

Crucially, many of those cars are “sales” to a related entity: the GSM taxi service—an enormously successful endeavor in the countries it has located in. While the money moves from one corporate pocket to another, it represents significant volume and real-world testing that boosts the delivery figures.

Instead, the bottom line looks like a financial disaster zone. But it that true?

Everything or nothing

But here’s the thing—this is pure Pham Nhat Vuong.

The billionaire chairman has made it crystal clear he’s willing to lose whatever it takes to make VinFast succeed. You don’t hear that from the overly cautious American car executive scared of the stock backlash of such an announcement.

Mother company VinGroup decides fast. And good son VinFast carries out the orders quickly. I was sitting in their Hanoi offices in 2022 when the memo went out: no more internal combustion engines. Period. While Tesla was the only major new-world automaker brave enough—or insane enough (like Nissan)—to bet everything on electric, here was a Vietnamese startup that had barely figured out conventional cars making the same all-or-nothing wager.

With Vuong on record saying he’ll burn through more money if necessary, those staggering quarterly losses start looking less like financial mismanagement and more like a deliberate war chest being deployed. Every dollar of loss is deliberate, part of a $2 billion gamble that most Americans will eventually buy cars from a brand they can’t pronounce. The company is torching cash on three massive fronts: building a network of shiny showrooms from California to Germany, launching marketing blitzes to convince skeptical buyers that “Vietnamese luxury EV” isn’t an oxymoron, and funding R&D labs working around the clock on next-generation vehicles.

“Live long and prosper”

The intentions behind VinSpace are probably the “highest” possible form of ambition. With Mr. Spock’s Vulcan salute, “live long and prosper.”

Down on Earth, its sprawling Hai Phong facility continues to churn out cars, while its American manufacturing intentions rising on a North Carolina farmland are temporarily on hold. This facility isn’t just a factory—it’s VinFast’s entire American dream materialized in steel and concrete. If it works, the company dodges crushing import tariffs and slashes shipping costs while planting a flag in the world’s most competitive car market.

It is here that the delays—seen as one of those much-lambasted missteps—took on a cosmic, almost divine meaning.

When Hurricane Helene devastated Western North Carolina in late 2024, the state’s infrastructure and construction environment ground to a halt. The VinFast site, though physically protected from the worst of the floods, was months away from significant vertical construction. Some internal observers must have quietly considered the delay an unexpected form of “divine providence,” sparing a multi-billion-dollar build from potential catastrophic disruption. If it doesn’t work, well, that’s a massive failure.

The brutal math is simple: VinFast is paying the astronomical (no pun intended) price of admission to play with Tesla, GM, and Ford. The company’s bet is that today’s financial bloodbath will look like pocket change once they’re manufacturing hundreds of thousands of EVs annually — whether that’s in Vietnam, Indonesia, India, or on good ol’ American soil.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/VinFastEntrance-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 11:06:32.943048

From Johnston County to Durham and Wake Counties, Mecklenberg County, and Gaston County, these projects will bring new manufacturing, life sciences, and finance jobs to the state — located in urban cores, as well as growing rural communities.

Vulcan Elements, a manufacturer of rare earth magnets, is creating 1,000 jobs and investing $918 million in the Johnston County community of Benson. The company’s 1 million-square-foot facility will become the largest magnet factory in the world outside of China, and will help the U.S. reshore this crucial component of the supply chain for many defense and commercial electronics.

North Carolina Governor Josh Stein announced the final site selection on November 19 at the Benson facility. “The confidence that Vulcan Elements has to expand to Johnston County is proof that we have the right assets to help innovative start-ups scale their businesses,” said Gov. Stein. “With semiconductor chips, batteries, and now magnets, North Carolina is building an innovation and manufacturing hub that will drive the economy of the future.”

“North Carolina is a natural home for Vulcan Elements’ next stage,” said Vulcan Elements CEO John Maslin. “We need to draw on world-class talent, innovation, and infrastructure as we secure one of the 21st century’s most important supply chains. As home to our current facility, North Carolina has proven that it has all three. And as we create 1,000 new American jobs, we will tap into the region’s deep bench of experience across industries—from engineers and technicians who understand hardware and manufacturing to military veterans who have spent their careers managing complex supply chains, operating heavy machinery, and serving their country.”

The announcement follows Vulcan Elements’ $1.4 billion partnership with the United States Government to build a 100% vertically-integrated, domestic magnet supply chain with the company’s upstream partner ReElement Technologies. As United States Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick stated: “Our investment in Vulcan Elements will accelerate U.S. production of rare earth magnets for American manufacturers. We are laser-focused on bringing critical mineral and rare earth manufacturing back home, ensuring America’s supply chain is strong, secure and perfectly reliable.”

Maersk, FIT Precast, Aspida Financial Services & Novartis

Maersk, a global shipping company based in Copenhagen, Denmark, is creating 520 jobs and investing $16 million in Charlotte. The site will be home to the company’s North American headquarters. Maersk already has a sizable presence in Charlotte, and with this move, will eventually employ over 1,300 people in the Queen City.

Said Charles van der Steene, President, North America Region at Maersk, “We have substantially grown and transformed our North American business, and workforce, on our path to become an integrated logistics partner for our customers. As we looked to the future, we realized an official North American headquarters would allow us to even better serve our customers and continue to build a workplace where everyone can thrive. For more than two decades, we’ve built strong relationships and a solid foundation in Charlotte. We’re excited to deepen our roots in this vibrant community and in the North America region.

FIT Precast, an industrial concrete product manufacturer, is creating 125 jobs and investing $102 million in the Gaston County community of Gastonia. The company will build its headquarters and a concrete pipe production facility at the site, which will be the most advanced precast concrete manufacturing site in the U.S.

“The demand for resilient, American-made infrastructure has never been greater, and North Carolina is the ideal place to meet that challenge,” said Matt Goreski, President of FIT Precast. “This flagship headquarters and production facility is the most advanced precast concrete manufacturing site in the country; investing in both leading-edge technology and the people of North Carolina with high paying, meaningful careers. The Gaston County EDC and the State of North Carolina consistently went above and beyond to secure this project, we would like to thank them for making this our new home.”

Aspida Financial Services, a life insurance and annuity company, is creating 1,000 jobs and investing over $28 million in Durham County. The company will locate to the former IQVIA building along I-40 and make the location its headquarters. A member of Aspida Holdings Ltd, Aspida Financial Services was founded in 2020 and is based in Durham. The fast-growing financial services company has more than $25 billion in assets. “Aspida’s expansion in our home city of Durham reinforces our commitment to the local community, and to our continued growth in North Carolina,” said Lou Hensley, CEO and President of Aspida. “The Triangle’s support of business advancement, expanding infrastructure, and heavy focus on technology create the right environment for our quickly growing organization to thrive. We are excited to continue to support the community in which we work and live.”

“Aspida’s decision to scale its headquarters in Durham reflects the strength of our state’s talent pipeline and the collaborative spirit of our economic development partners,” said North Carolina Commerce Secretary Lee Lilley. “We look forward to supporting the growth of other home-grown North Carolina companies.”

Novartis, a life sciences company, is investing $771 million in three sites across Wake County and Durham County. The sites will house a small-molecule manufacturing facility, large-molecule manufacturing facility, and a fill-finish facility. Novartis, as part of an incentive agreement with the state of North Carolina, will create a total of 380 jobs across all three projects. However, the company anticipates exceeding that total and plans to hire upwards of 700 people at the three locations.

“In the last two days alone, five companies announced new finance, corporate, manufacturing, and life sciences jobs that will employ thousands of North Carolinians for years to come,” said Christopher Chung, CEO of the Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina. “This diverse range of projects shows that no matter the industry, no matter the locale, North Carolina has an ecosystem where every company can grow and thrive.”",https://businessfacilities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/north-carolina-governor-stein.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 12:02:49.765833

Federal energy policy has been the subject of such rancorous political debate that fossil fuels, renewable energy and electric vehicles have become part of the culture wars dividing people across the United States.

But while the federal government continues picking winners and losers among energy technologies, Texas demonstrates an affordable and reliable path to achieving American energy resilience that repeatedly prioritizes practicality over ideology.

To be certain, the state has had its fair share of reliability challenges in recent years, and extreme weather will continue to be a risk to our energy infrastructure. But Texas is blessed with tremendous natural gas, wind and solar resources, and embracing these with an all-of-the-above strategy has kept the state’s electricity prices affordable in recent years. Equally important, Texas has shown that resources must stand on their own economic merits. If they don’t deliver affordable, reliable energy in practice — not just on paper — they don’t scale here.

Electricity rates for residential and business customers in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas are 24% lower than the national average, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That won’t seem low enough to Texan households struggling to pay bills, but rates would be substantially higher without the solar power and energy storage capacity brought online here in recent years. We’ve seen the results of this development in the AI-powered wholesale price forecasts we produce for ERCOT.

Amperon’s data shows that both day ahead and real time market prices have trended down significantly over the last four years as ERCOT’s solar capacity has increased by more than 200%.

With no fuel costs, solar operates at a low marginal cost, pushing market prices down. Thanks to ERCOT’s competitive market structure, wholesale cost savings make their way not just to investors but also to customers.

The dynamics are the same for wind power, but the development of new wind generation hasn’t moved as quickly as solar has in recent years. Combined, though, wind and solar can now supply up to nearly half of ERCOT’s total electricity demand, which makes the market less reactive to increases in the cost of natural gas. The rapid installation of battery storage is also expanding the impact of low-cost renewables by storing and discharging excess generation during other times of high demand.

But affordability isn’t just about wholesale market dynamics; it’s also about designing rules that incentivize the right behaviors for consumers.

In Houston, for example, many retail providers offer free power at night or on weekends, which encourages customers to shift usage when the grid has excess supply. Programs like smart EV charging reward Texans for plugging in cars when it makes the most sense for the grid and their pocketbooks. These are the kinds of consumer-friendly market rules that keep our system efficient, innovative and fair.

Unfortunately, when it comes to affordability, this may be about as good as it gets. Energy Innovation, one of the many research groups modeling the economic impacts of recent federal legislation, projects the unwinding of tax credits for carbon-neutral generation will keep Texas from gaining another 77 GW of solar and wind power, which is almost equivalent to the entire state’s current peak demand on hot summer days.

Without new solar and wind, projected increases in future demand will have to be met by running existing thermal generation, which will put upward pressure on market prices. Although one could argue that if prices go up as much as Energy Innovation predicts (up to 54% for residential and business customers), the data centers and other commercial enterprises expected to arrive in the state won’t ever come.

The sudden policy swing isn’t just about affordability and economic growth though, because diverse electricity generation also makes ERCOT more resilient. The combination of natural gas, wind, solar and batteries (not to mention nuclear and hydro) keeps the power grid from being overly dependent on any single type of generation. For example, in late July, 5,019 MW of coal-fired generation went offline without causing an emergency.

Diversification creates the flexibility to absorb future disruptions in fuel supply too, and it decentralizes the entire system, making it less vulnerable to the kind of widespread outage that happened with Winter Storm Uri in 2021.

Texas is also paving the way for next-generation nuclear power with several small modular reactor projects greenlit, supported in part by the state’s newly created Texas Energy Fund. Nuclear won’t be the largest source anytime soon, but it adds a stable, carbon-free option to the state’s diversified mix.

Integrating large amounts of solar and wind was always going to require a period of operational adjustment, especially until the system had enough battery capacity to respond rapidly to unexpected mismatches in supply and demand. But this combination of new solar and battery capacity is why there were no Energy Emergency Alerts in 2024, despite “extended high summer peak periods,” according to the recent Assessment of Reliability Performance report published by TexasRE. The assessment also found the chance of rolling blackouts this summer is just 0.3% — down from 12% last summer (when, it should be noted, there were no blackouts).

Regardless of what’s being said at the national level, we know from watching the Texas market closely that ERCOT CEO Pablo Vegas was right when he told a House Committee meeting earlier this year that “the market, as structured today, is very well suited to support the growth trajectories that we’re seeing increase in the state of Texas.”

Texas boasts a competitive marketplace with low barriers to entry, renewable energy zones for easier planning and non-partisan energy debates that have helped keep industry-friendly regulations in place. These policies and diverse generation sources absolutely affect the day-to-day market prices we forecast and track.

In short, the highly politicized national energy debates are missing the point. It’s not about ideology; it’s about doing what works. And what works in Texas is competition, consumer choice and resources that prove their worth economically. If we continue to let data — not dogma — drive energy decisions here, Texas will be fine, and we might just show the rest of the country a thing or two in the process.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/4KExPXRr_eBX86TwFqNBh396fRG4wo1jZOT81i82b7U/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMzAzMzk3NDc2LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-11-20 11:05:45.145860

That’s in line with state law, which currently prohibits nuclear waste storage.
While the company’s proposal to build a nuclear fuel manufacturing plant in Campbell County does not involve radioactive waste or storing such materials, nuclear energy companies are sensitive to local opposition, according to Gillette-based L&H Industrial President Mike Wandler.
Meantime, some in favor of the resolution noted previous legislative attempts to allow spent nuclear fuel waste in Wyoming.
“It basically lets the community know that, as commissioners, we choose not to accept nuclear waste and spent fuel from [the nation’s] legacy waste.","Top officials in one of the nation’s most energy-prolific counties — home to uranium mining, oil, natural gas and the most productive coal-mining district in North America — are cautiously supportive of the nuclear energy industry’s burgeoning interest in northeast Wyoming.

But they don’t want its radioactive waste.

The Campbell County Board of Commissioners passed a resolution Tuesday stating the body will not support storing nuclear waste locally. That’s in line with state law, which currently prohibits nuclear waste storage. In anticipation that could change, the Campbell County resolution urges state lawmakers to allow “citizens to vote on the matter of high-level nuclear waste storage.”

The five-member commission voted 4-1 in favor of the position, with Commissioner Jim Ford casting the single “no” vote. The county solicited public input on the matter for several weeks and redrafted the resolution multiple times, most recently during a Nov. 13 workshop. Commissioner Jerry Means said he proposed the resolution amid growing interest in Wyoming from nuclear energy companies, as well as often intense public debate about nuclear energy’s risks and benefits.

Opponents of the resolution, before and after Tuesday’s vote, warned it may send a signal to the industry, and to BWXT in particular, that it is not welcome in the community. While the company’s proposal to build a nuclear fuel manufacturing plant in Campbell County does not involve radioactive waste or storing such materials, nuclear energy companies are sensitive to local opposition, according to Gillette-based L&H Industrial President Mike Wandler. He’s frequently credited for the industry’s recent interest in setting up manufacturing shops in Wyoming.

“So any resolutions against nuclear, they’re going to take very seriously,” Wandler recently told WyoFile. “They’re just going to go away and find someplace else to bring those jobs and to bring that revenue.”

Wandler and other nuclear energy industry supporters note that people sometimes conflate BWXT’s plans in Campbell County with a different proposal in Natrona County. Radiant Industries, unlike BWXT, did include storing spent nuclear fuel, but the California-based company scrapped its plans to build a nuclear microreactor manufacturing facility in October. The company cited a lack of “regulatory certainty” about whether the state would further loosen its ban on nuclear fuel waste storage — a key change in law needed to accommodate Radiant’s plan to store spent fuel from its microreactors at a campus outside the town of Bar Nunn.

Reached for comment after the resolution was passed, BWXT said it isn’t shying away from Campbell County.

“The resolution does not impact our proposed plans for a TRISO fuel fabrication facility in Gillette as our facility will neither create nor store high-level nuclear waste or spent nuclear fuel,” BWXT Advanced Nuclear Fuels Senior Director Josh Parker told WyoFile via email.

Meantime, some in favor of the resolution noted previous legislative attempts to allow spent nuclear fuel waste in Wyoming. Industry skeptics have also expressed fears that the federal government might force either an interim or permanent storage facility in a community that doesn’t want it.

“We all know laws can be changed every year,” Means said. “So this is basically getting out ahead of what I see for the future for Campbell County, because I do see people in our county, right here, [who] think that maybe we need to accept nuclear waste.”

The resolution

The commission’s 2-page resolution declared adherence to “the following guidelines regarding nuclear waste storage in Campbell County.”

No interim nuclear storage — domestically produced or relocated;

No consolidated interim storage — domestically produced or relocated;

No deep geological repository (caverns);

No deep geological repository (bore hole);

No exemptions granted for interim or consolidated storage, or geological repositories.

But what authorities or policy tools the county might use to enforce the guidelines are unclear.

According to the resolution, the commission “supports the development and siting of the nuclear industry in Campbell County, if such facilities do not produce, receive, or store nuclear waste, except what is currently permitted by Wyoming law as of the date of this resolution.”

“We can’t override the state or the federal government,” Means told WyoFile. “It basically lets the community know that, as commissioners, we choose not to accept nuclear waste and spent fuel from [the nation’s] legacy waste. It really has no [legal] backbone.”

It also notes that “current Wyoming law does not allow for the people to vote on the specific issue of nuclear waste storage,” and resolves that “the Campbell County Board of Commissioners supports any change in state law that would allow citizens to vote on the matter of high-level nuclear waste storage.”

Though several Wyoming lawmakers suspect there will be another attempt in the upcoming budget session to crack the door open wider for nuclear waste storage, it’s unclear whether there might be forthcoming legislation to allow for some kind of public referendum on the issue.

“Our resolution essentially says that, ‘Yeah, the Legislature should change the law to allow the citizens to vote on the issue,'” Commissioner Scott Clem, a former Wyoming representative, told WyoFile.

Radiant fallout

While opponents cheered Radiant’s pullout from Natrona County, the move shook many in the business community, particularly at the state level.

Gov. Mark Gordon pinned the blame on the far right of the Wyoming GOP.

“Members of the Freedom Caucus inspired ‘Club No’ convinced Radiant that Wyoming isn’t about leadership and problem solving,” Gordon said in a prepared statement in October. “‘Club No,’” he continued, “has ushered in a new culture of no matter who began or who commenced it, we’re against it. That is not the way Wyoming became the great state it is.”

Though it was not directly part of the Governor’s Business Forum agenda last week in Laramie, Radiant’s exit was a topic of discussion in the hallways and sometimes on the stage.

Many attendees “[are] mad about a certain project in the Natrona County area,” Wyoming Business Council Chief Executive Officer Josh Dorrell told the audience of about 500. “Why did we lose that? Because the vocal minority.”

For its part, the business council is ramping up efforts to garner support for nuclear energy development in Wyoming, according to Dorrell, both in general and for BWXT’s project in Campbell County, in particular.

The state is putting its financial might behind the project as well.

The Wyoming Energy Authority has recommended a $100 million state grant to support BWXT’s TRISO fuel manufacturing project. The grant, if approved by Gordon, would be the first and sole recipient of Wyoming’s Large Project Energy Matching Fund, created in 2024.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47643/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/camc011763653428.jpg?h=29234840&itok=wn46FwXC,N,,2025-11-20 11:03:52.750673

Following LPSC approval, Cleco will finalize and begin executing its five-year resiliency plan which will include over 550 projects that harden grid infrastructure by replacing electric equipment, undergrounding certain segments of the system, reinforcing utility poles and elevating substations above flood plains.

“The grid resiliency investments will reduce outages and lead to faster restoration times,” said Andre Guillory, chief customer officer for Cleco. “Additionally, a portion of the projects are focused on critical customers, like hospitals and emergency services. This work will enhance and protect vulnerable communities, first responders and critical services which are essential during storms or times of crisis.”

30%: California's 2035 EV Mandate Loses Steam

Photo by: Rivian

The California Air Resources Board (CARB), now blocked by the federal government from enforcing its far-reaching emissions rules, has begun rethinking some of them. Its target goal to eliminate the sales of new gas cars by 2035 has been a long-standing push by the state government, but now it's becoming a ""very active area of discussion.""

The federal waiver given to California under the Clean Air Act allowed the state to set its own emission standards. More than a dozen other states then agreed to follow these standards. Axios gives a briefing on what's up in the air now—besides pollution:

California's strict emission rules, blocked by the Trump administration in June, had been a template for other states that share its ambitious climate goals.

But as they now look to replace those rules, state regulators are signaling that requiring all new cars to be electric by 2035 might not be practical anymore. Affordability concerns, vanishing tax incentives and insufficient EV charging infrastructure make it unlikely that automakers can achieve escalating EV sales targets.

""We cannot enforce these rules at the moment,"" Christopher Grundler, deputy executive officer at the California Air Resources Board, told participants at a CARB workshop last month.

Coming along for the legal ride are other states where Attorneys General have signed onto the lawsuit against the Feds to fight for California's state rights. Other states like Maryland, Washington and Vermont have paused enforcement of their own EV sales targets.

Here's what CARB's chair told Politico:

CARB officially opened its rulemaking on new vehicle emissions regulations at a workshop last week, and hopes to finalize the rules by summer 2027.

“I think that remains a very ambitious goal, and I am grateful — as you saw in the workshop last week — that we now have the time to rethink creatively what that goal should be going forward,” Sanchez said in a wide-ranging interview with POLITICO.

As it looks, though, plenty of people in California and across the U.S. will continue to drive (and buy) new gas cars in a decade. But that's a long time from now and—as we've seen—a lot can change in 10 years.

60%: Lyft CEO Says Robotaxis Won't Replace Humans Anytime Soon

Photo by: Lyft

Robotaxi proponents love to talk up the potential of a driverless future like the current market is just some giant loading screen between the invention of the steering wheel and its removal. Naturally, AV providers are some of the most excited about this potential—but not all rideshare companies are feeling that way.

Lyft's CEO, David Risher, recently spoke on the topic with a more grounded take: human drivers aren't going anywhere any time soon. Not in ten years, and certainly not in five. Manufacturers aren't ready, and neither are regulators or riders. Here's what Fortune, quoting Risher, has to say:

“That will be the case for years and years and years to come,” he said. The [car manufacturers] aren’t entirely ready. The technology isn’t entirely ready for fog or snow or heavy rain or whatever it is. People, riders aren’t necessarily excited about it [and] regulators aren’t necessarily enthusiastic about it in every place,” he said.

That’s going to make the rollout of self-driving slow. Risher said he would be surprised if 10% of Lyft’s business came from self-driving vehicles by 2030.

He thinks most people are wary of self-driving cars and prefer a human at the wheel. “Customers won’t demand it. They’ll just say, I don’t want to get in a self-driving car.”

There's an ulterior motive to Risher's belief, though: the almighty dollar.

It comes from the value proposition that robotaxis bring the company. Sure, they can't call in sick, but with the way that Lyft operates today, many of the company's actual costs—we're talking about depreciation, maintenance, cleaning, charging and even some financial risk—are shifted to the driver since they're the owner of the vehicle. That sort of risk transfer is the company's entire business model as of today.

There's also a massive upfront cost to buy a full-fledged, vetted autonomous vehicle capable of being a robotaxi. “Today, these cost maybe $250,000 to $300,000,"" said Risher, clearly disregarding Tesla's promise of a cheap, vision-based autonomous robotaxi. ""A very expensive product, whereas a Prius or Corolla is maybe $30,00 or $40,000.”

So, where does the CEO see things going? Nowhere fast: “I don’t think the idea of a driver being replaced by a robot is a very likely thing. In fact, I think it’s zero likelihood in any reasonable time frame.""

90%: Detroit Summoned To Testify In DC Together For First Time Since 2008

Photo by: InsideEVs

It looks like Detroit is getting the band back together. Not for a reunion tour, but for a formal hearing. For the first time since the 2008 financial crisis, Detroit's big three—Ford, GM and Stellantis—are being summoned to Washington together.

The trio (plus Tesla, to represent Silicon Valley) will make their way to Capitol Hill in January so that lawmakers can poke and prod one big elephant that helped drive inflation over the last five years: vehicle affordability. But their target here is clearly emissions rules and investments in electric vehicles.

Automotive News reveals the details:

The committee’s Jan. 14 hearing “will examine how radical global warming regulations and mandated technologies have driven up the cost of vehicles for American consumers,” [Senator Ted] Cruz said in a statement.

The Texas Republican said American consumers are “hyper-focused” on rising vehicle prices and that Congress needs to address the issue. In the statement, he said senators want to look at “how government interference continues to make vehicles expensive and out of reach for American customers and how we can restore competition and choice.”

[...] The invitation to testify cited data saying the average price of a new vehicle in the U.S. has doubled from $24,296 in 2015 to more than $50,000 today.

When the three were last in D.C. together, the atmosphere was less conversational and more about Washington helping out with a bailout. Nobody is asking for checks this time around, though. Instead, it seems like a politically-charged probe into safety and regulatory requirements set during previous administrations.

Interestingly—and surely without coincidence—these hearings will be held on the first day of the 2026 Detroit Auto Show. That means that if any new products or big announcements are to be made that day, it'll be done without the help of the CEOs.

100%: Can Automakers Talk Their Way Out Of The Affordability Crisis?

When adjusted for inflation, the average vehicle price of $24,296 from 2015 is about $34,000. Lawmakers want to know where that other $16,000 came from, and some appear to suspect the additional costs are related to ""mandated technologies"" and emissions.

Since 2015, automakers have been required to add tech like rear backup cameras, have voluntarily added automatic emergency braking in preparation for further mandates and also new ADAS tech (like lane centering) that require more advanced sensor suites. And let's not forget stricter emission requirements.

Are lawmakers right in probing automakers about inflated costs, or is the reasoning obvious? And what does that mean for the future of vehicle prices are tech becomes even more intricate?

“What we’re seeing at the federal level is a morally indefensible and astronomically ignorant approach to energy and climate action,” DFL State Rep. Larry Kraft said on the call.
Given the vast scale of human-caused climate change, however, their direct planetary impact will be negligible.
And formidable funding challenges — made worse by the federal government’s war on clean energy and climate science — loom over the entire enterprise.","Minnesotans stared at their screens in horror last June as the raging Blue Earth River swallowed a beloved country store near Mankato. The same flood badly damaged a nearby dam and caused well over $1 billion dollars in damage across 22 southern Minnesota counties.

It was one of more than 60 billion-dollar weather disasters to hit the state over the past 45 years, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. About 20 of those have struck since 2021, laying bare the real-world stakes of a warmer, wetter Upper Midwest.

As the Trump administration sits out an annual United Nations climate change meeting in Brazil that could (maybe) produce a detailed roadmap to transition the global economy away from fossil fuels, local governments in Minnesota and across the U.S. are preparing for more extreme weather to come.

At least 22 Minnesota city, county, regional and tribal governments have published “climate action” or resilience plans to mitigate the human and financial costs of future weather disasters, according to a report out Tuesday from Josefina Hajek-Herrera, a fellow with the Building Power Resource Center and climate policy consultant.

They include Minneapolis, St. Paul, Rochester, Duluth and 12 other communities with more than 10,000 Minnesotans. Mankato published its own climate action plan less than a year after the June 2024 flood inundated low-lying parts of town.

State Sen. Jen McEwan, DFL-Duluth, said during a call — hosted by report sponsors 100%, an environmental justice nonprofit, and Building Power Resource Center — that the infrastructure-busting impacts of extreme weather are apparent even in her purported “climate change haven” hometown.

In June 2012, Duluth received over seven inches of rain in less than 48 hours, tearing up hillside roads and sewers. Powerful storms damaged Duluth’s popular Lakewalk a few years later, spurring a major fortification project set to begin construction in 2026.

“(Those floods) woke up a lot of people to the fact that climate change is happening now, in real time,” McEwan said.

The planning push comes as President Trump rolls back ambitious environmental laws, regulations and programs enacted under former President Biden. The Trump administration and its Republican allies in Congress have canceled billions in federal grants to help local governments reduce pollution and harden infrastructure against extreme weather. Billions more remain in legal limbo, including $7 billion in renewable energy funding for lower-income communities — which the Biden administration said would cut energy bills for 900,000 households — and nearly $1 billion for “pre-disaster” mitigation projects.

“What we’re seeing at the federal level is a morally indefensible and astronomically ignorant approach to energy and climate action,” DFL State Rep. Larry Kraft said on the call. Minnesota cities, he added, “can pick up the slack.”

Municipal planning staff or outside consultants take the lead on climate action planning, often with substantial input from residents, businesses and community groups. Most plans detail a mix of shorter- and longer-term goals to reduce local greenhouse gas emissions, such as by purchasing renewable power, installing high-efficiency electric heating at city facilities and adding electric vehicles to city fleets.

Those goals mirror or in some cases front-run Minnesota’s statutory mandate for statewide carbon neutrality by 2050. In that sense, the plans put a local spin on what state law already requires over the next 25 years. Given the vast scale of human-caused climate change, however, their direct planetary impact will be negligible.

In recognition that the costs of climate change are already piling up, all but one of the 10 climate action plans released since 2022 contain “climate vulnerability assessments” that identify populations and infrastructure most at risk from extreme heat, flooding, poor air quality, food insecurity and high energy costs, Hajek-Herrera said in the report.

The report hails successes like St. Paul’s jargon-free Climate Action Dashboard, which shows progress toward its 2030 goal of carbon-neutrality in city operations across city-led initiatives like electric heating at Como Park Zoo and Conservatory and the new, ultra-low-impact North End Community Center.

On the call, Diana Chaman Salas, Hennepin County climate and resiliency department director, ticked off some of her employer’s accomplishments: a 10% cut to miles driven by county vehicles, a comparable reduction in county departments’ electricity use from onsite solar power by 2027 and enough community garden capacity to feed 1,000 people last year.

But recent plans’ focus on “cross-jurisdictional relationships” relating to transportation, education, renewable energy development and other projects offer tacit acknowledgement that local governments can’t do everything on their own.

St. Paul admits its fleet electrification plan has been held back by slow deployment of public charging infrastructure. Grand Marais fell behind on its building electrification goals earlier this decade due in part to a local shortage of qualified heat pump technicians, Hajek-Herrera said in the report. Electric grid constraints and red tape around key grant programs have stymied Northfield’s ambitious plans for solar arrays on public property.

And formidable funding challenges — made worse by the federal government’s war on clean energy and climate science — loom over the entire enterprise.

“Ongoing uncertainty in federal climate policy further underscores the necessity for sustained and enhanced state-level support to bridge implementation gaps and strengthen local capacity,” Hajek-Herrera said.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-87/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/electricschoolbus-1536x1024-1-1024x6831763648646.jpeg?h=199d8c1f&itok=ZtIrNV6d,N,,2025-11-20 12:02:24.223218

The conversations have been edited for clarity and length. Here’s why we’re doing this.

I’m a professor of environmental health at Drexel University. I study how the impacts of pollution can differ because of a person’s surroundings and individual circumstances. This will be an important influence on children’s health as the climate changes, an area that I have focused on in recent years.

I had a grant from the Environmental Protection Agency to identify the relationships between heat, pollution and children’s health in New York State. It’s an important case study because New York State includes the most and least populated areas in the country, like Manhattan and the Adirondacks.

Instead of looking at things that can cause stress, like income inequality, and how those can make the effects of heat and pollution worse, we were trying to identify the resources in communities where children appear to be less affected by heat and pollution. This information can help identify the most cost-effective changes communities can make to protect their children.

We combined data on 22 million child emergency department visits and hospitalizations with U.S. census information. We also considered a wide range of community factors not included in those data sets — everything from supermarket locations, transportation access, voter registration and broadband access. A Ph.D. student in my lab reached out to 350 school districts in the state. So a lot of groundwork was done to build up a really complicated and huge database that represented a massive number of children statewide.

It was a three-year grant, but it built on research that we had been developing for over 15 years. Our early results showed that days with high air pollution and extreme temperatures did have more child emergency department visits.

On May 12, I received an email saying our project was to be terminated immediately. There was no warning, no conversation.

At the time, we were in the final stages of being able to combine our data to answer the critical question: Which community investments really matter, and how can they help children be more resilient to pollution and heat? The next step would have been to finish analyzing the data, but we weren’t able to get that far.

We appealed the cancellation and got a response stating that the project wasn’t within the scope of the current E.P.A. The administration has decided to close the entire division supporting this grant, the Office of Research and Development. It was funding my lab’s work, and the work of so many other people doing really important stuff in environmental health science.

An abrupt cancellation means that we will never get the payoff from so much upfront investment. We wanted another year to support our doctoral students and finish the work, and spend time reporting back to our community and government partners to make sure that they were getting all the information they were promised out of this process.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/19/multimedia/00cli-lostsci-cloughtery-lcmj/00cli-lostsci-cloughtery-lcmj-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 11:04:58.138680

Taking the closure language out of federal hands still leaves Comanche 2 and other closures in state regulations, and Colorado will enforce those no matter what the Trump administration does, state officials say.
“A decision is expected in mid-December.” Air Pollution Control Director Michael Ogletree said in an emailed statement, “The big picture is that Colorado’s commitments and priorities have not changed.
On Wednesday, the administration again ordered an extension of operations at a Michigan plant originally scheduled to close last May, and state officials and environmental groups are fighting the extensions in court.
Tri-State operates Craig Station and co-owns it with the Salt River Project, the Platte River Power Authority, PacifiCorp and Xcel Energy.","Colorado health officials want to withdraw the looming closure of Xcel’s Comanche 2 coal power unit in Pueblo from federal review in order to extend its operations through expected high demand next summer, but environmental groups charge the Polis administration with further backsliding on dirty coal.

A last-minute agenda item asks the Air Quality Control Commission on Thursday to approve a state letter pulling Comanche 2’s closure on Dec. 31 from a federally required plan to fight haze and other air pollution. State clean air and renewable energy officials are working with Xcel and the Public Utilities Commission to reverse Comanche 2’s pending closure and allow it to operate through 2026 to avoid electric shortages and fuel price hikes.

State officials call the letter to the EPA a strategic retreat, and insist they are not giving up legislatively mandated targets to close coal plants and have 80% of Colorado’s electricity generated by clean, renewable sources by 2030. Taking the closure language out of federal hands still leaves Comanche 2 and other closures in state regulations, and Colorado will enforce those no matter what the Trump administration does, state officials say.

“Withdrawing the provision ensures the federal process aligns with the state process” while the PUC evaluates the Comanche 2 extension petition from Xcel and state agencies, a state spokesperson said. “A decision is expected in mid-December.”

Air Pollution Control Director Michael Ogletree said in an emailed statement, “The big picture is that Colorado’s commitments and priorities have not changed. We are continuing to protect air quality and reduce emissions from power generation while ensuring Coloradans’ access to affordable, reliable energy. This strategic move will help the state ensure a just, equitable transition from coal plants while we continue addressing climate change, regional haze, and ground-level ozone pollution.”

But it’s a surrender, not a strategic retreat, environmental advocates say.

“If the dates are only in state rules it means only the state can enforce the dates. Given that state health and the Colorado Energy Office have already indicated they intend to appease the Trump administration and support keeping several coal-fired power plants open beyond their retirement dates, it’s clear they likely have no intention of enforcing the retirement dates,” said Jeremy Nichols, with the Center for Biological Diversity.

“This whole thing could just be a cover up to make the retirement dates meaningless through a lack of enforcement,” Nichols said. “It’s really bizarre, I don’t see any strategy here, just a disturbing willingness by the Polis administration to completely back down from our state’s commitments on climate and clean energy.”

Colorado’s coal-plant closure plans are being stretched by a combination of Xcel’s operational failures and rapid growth in high-volume electricity demand from data centers that Xcel says will push needs up 8% a year. Xcel’s troubled Comanche 3 unit at the Pueblo complex is offline again until at least June, after years of breakdowns. Xcel on Nov. 10 applied to the PUC — supported by state clean air officials and the Colorado Energy Office — to extend smaller Comanche 2’s operations for 2026 to provide backup and reliability at peak periods where sharply increased demand has eliminated any cushion.

Comanche’s unit 1 was retired in 2022.

Sierra Club Colorado declined comment on the pending AQCC vote regarding the EPA, saying the group was working on its filing for the same questions confronting the PUC. But the club has previously said the consequences of Comanche 2 running throughout 2026 are clear: “more air pollution in Pueblo and higher electricity bills for everyone.”

The Trump administration has been overriding local plans in multiple states as it tries to boost the coal industry, ordering some coal plants to stay open beyond their scheduled shuttering date. On Wednesday, the administration again ordered an extension of operations at a Michigan plant originally scheduled to close last May, and state officials and environmental groups are fighting the extensions in court.

The Tri-State Generation cooperative is also expecting Trump administration orders to keep the 45-year-old, 446-megawatt Craig Unit 1 running in Moffat County.

The unit is scheduled to close at the end of the year, and the Craig Station’s two other units will close in 2028. Tri-State operates Craig Station and co-owns it with the Salt River Project, the Platte River Power Authority, PacifiCorp and Xcel Energy.

Xcel’s Comanche operations have been the center of a policy tug of war for years. Many civic leaders in Pueblo County are worried about the loss of jobs and Xcel tax revenues when the coal units shut down, and some are even floating the idea of building a modern nuclear reactor on the site to create jobs. Other advocacy and neighborhood groups have fought pollution from Comanche and Pueblo’s other industrial sources for decades, and have looked forward to decommissioning the coal units.

The letter to the EPA that state health officials are asking the air quality commission to approve credits state agencies for their “robust and nimble” response to operational problems at Comanche 3 and the growing data center demand for energy. The letter adds, though, that the Air Pollution Control Division also intends to work with Xcel “to minimize and mitigate any emissions impact from this action.”

Colorado’s environmental groups aren’t buying it, and will make their opposition known in public comment periods before the AQCC’s vote to advance the letter Thursday.

“The Polis administration is clearly going to bat for coal, opting to keep dirty and costly coal burning power plants operating rather than holding utilities accountable to building out the affordable clean energy we need,” Nichols said. “Xcel’s ‘reliability’ issues are its own fault, and the company shouldn’t be rewarded with a free pass to keep polluting.”",https://newspack-coloradosun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Colo_Sun_Comanche_01_Sept_2025-copy.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 12:01:24.892096

The facility will have a magnet manufacturing capacity of 10,000 metric tons and is expected to create more than 1,000 jobs. Construction of the facility is expected to begin within the next year, and employees are anticipated to be on site by 2029, according to Vulcan Elements’ statement.

The upcoming facility follows news of a heavy U.S. government investment in Vulcan Elements. Earlier this month, the company announced a $1.4 billion partnership with the government to expand the “vertically integrated, domestic magnet supply chain” for rare-earth magnets.

That investment is part of a broader U.S. strategy to increase competition in the mining and refining of rare-earth metals, which China currently dominates. Rare-earth metals are essential components of most electronics, from consumer goods like smartphones to security systems such as autonomous drones and ballistic missiles.

Vulcan Elements CEO John Maslin noted the importance of the rare-earth supply chain, adding that the North Carolina facility is a crucial step in building U.S. dominance.

“We need to draw on world-class talent, innovation and infrastructure as we secure one of the 21st century’s most important supply chains. As home to our current facility, North Carolina has proven that it has all three,” Mr. Maslin wrote in a statement. “And as we create 1,000 new American jobs, we will tap into the region’s deep bench of experience across industries — from engineers and technicians who understand hardware and manufacturing to military veterans who have spent their careers managing complex supply chains, operating heavy machinery, and serving their country.”

Ironically, the metals themselves are not rare and are found during most mining operations. However, the refinement process is technical and expensive.

Beijing currently has a stranglehold over the industry, controlling over 50% of the mining sector and approximately 90% of the world’s rare-earth refinement infrastructure. Experts say China’s level of control is alarming and could have disastrous effects for U.S. security.

“The tank, the battleship, nuclear energy, wind energy, gas energy, all of it relies on rare earth metals. And without it, our society is crippled not from a military standpoint, only from an actual everyday operation standpoint,” said Nick Myers, CEO and co-founder of rare-earth processing company Phoenix Tailings. “They are playing on a different level right now. China is engaging in economic warfare. They understand that warfare is not all kinetic, and they’re leveraging their economic power.”

Mr. Myers said Phoenix Tailings is one of the few U.S. companies seeking to support an entirely domestic rare-earth supply chain to bolster self-sufficiency. The company takes the waste, or tailings, of mining operations and processes it to produce rare-earth metals.

U.S. lawmakers have begun to sound the alarm over China’s dominance in the processing of rare-earth metals. Sen. Todd Young, Indiana Republican, has been one of the loudest voices urging U.S. leadership to get aggressive on rare-earth metals.

“They have vast stores of rare-earth minerals and other critical minerals that they provide into the American market,” the senator said of China in an exclusive interview with Threat Status. “These are key inputs as we electrify our economy. And they’re also key inputs to other, important, manufactured goods like defense articles. We literally cannot produce our defense goods without access to rare-earth minerals.”

In April, Mr. Young introduced a bill with Sen. Chris Coons, Delaware Democrat, that urges the U.S. Geological Survey to give America a more competitive edge in developing mines around the world. The bill, which has been cosigned by Sens. John Cornyn, Texas Republican, and John Hickenlooper, Colorado Democrat, is awaiting action in the Senate.",https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2025/11/04/China_Rare_Earths_59932_c0-146-2400-1546_s1200x700.jpg?132f371bebba18b50c5d95c76a93ddcb6d43cdf6,N,,2025-11-20 10:01:55.670839

The Total Sales Forecast

Total new-vehicle sales for November 2025, including retail and non-retail transactions, are projected to reach 1,255,900, a 5.2% decrease year over year, according to a joint forecast from J.D. Power and GlobalData. November 2025 has 25 selling days, one fewer than November 2024.

The seasonally adjusted annualized rate (SAAR) for total new-vehicle sales is expected to be 15.4 million units, down 1.2 million units from November 2024.

The Retail Sales Forecast

New-vehicle retail sales for November 2025 are projected to reach 1,058,500, a 4.8% decrease from November 2024.

The Takeaways

Thomas King, president of OEM solutions at J.D. Power:

“November’s results reflect another notable—yet anticipated—decline in the new-vehicle sales pace, driven largely by the pull-ahead of electric vehicle (EV) purchases prior to the expiration of federal EV tax credits on Sept. 30. That expiration prompted many shoppers to accelerate buying decisions, resulting in a surge in EV sales that temporarily inflated the overall industry sales pace. Now, two months after the credit expired, the industry continues to feel the effect of those accelerated purchases. In November, EVs are expected to account for just 6.0% of new-vehicle retail sales, consistent with October but well below the 12.9% recorded in September.

“Automakers are recalibrating pricing strategies following the expiration of EV tax credits, tariff dynamics and evolving fuel economy requirements, along with the transition to the new model year. These factors create some distortions in typical seasonal discount patterns. Discounts on EVs are expected to average $11,869 in November, up $260 from November 2024 but down $928 from October 2025. Discounts on non-EVs are projected at $2,960, an increase of $161 from a year ago.

“The average manufacturer's incentive spend per vehicle is on track to reach $3,211, which is $375 higher than October but $125 lower than a year ago. The year-over-year decline in incentive spending is mostly due to sales shifting away from heavily discounted EVs and moving towards non-EVs with much lower discounts. The declining percentage of vehicles leased compared to a year ago is adding secondary pressure to lower incentive spending. Leasing is expected to decline 2.7 percentage points from November 2024, reaching 20.5% of sales. EV manufacturers have heavily relied on leasing to allow consumers to benefit from the EV tax credit, but EV leasing has declined 12.0 percentage points from November 2024, trending at 54%. A lower percentage of EV leases combined with a lower percentage of EV sales is driving incentive spending down from a year ago.

“Affordability pressures remain, with monthly finance payments reaching a record for the month of November at $760. In response, more consumers are turning to extended 84-month loan terms, which are expected to account for 11.1% of financed sales this month—nearing the highest level on record for the month of November set in 2022. The average new-vehicle retail transaction price in November is expected to reach $46,029, up $722 or 1.6% from November 2024.

“Easing interest rates and strong used-vehicle values—reflected in higher trade-in equity—are providing meaningful relief to buyers facing elevated monthly payments.”

The average interest rate for new-vehicle loans in November is 6.05%, a decrease of 27 basis points from a year ago.

“The average used-vehicle price is trending toward $29,696, up $725 from a year ago. This reflects the combination of reduced supply of recent model-year used vehicles due to lower new-vehicle production during the pandemic, fewer lease maturities and manufacturers moderating discounts. The rise in used-vehicle prices is good news for new-vehicle buyers with a trade-in, although average trade-in equity in November is down a modest $111 year over year to $7,822. The number of new-vehicle buyers with negative equity on their trade-in is expected to reach 26.9%—an increase of 3.3 percentage points from November 2024. Although negative equity is rising, it remains below the peak November level of 32.9% recorded in 2019.

“Elevated transaction prices in November are not enough to offset the lower sales pace, with consumers on track to spend nearly $46.8 billion on new vehicles this month—6.4% lower than a year ago. Total retailer profit per unit—which includes vehicle gross plus finance and insurance income—is expected to be $2,161, up $6 from November 2024 and down $54 from October 2025. The improvement in retailer profit per unit is primarily a function of lower EV sales, which typically generate lower retailer profits than non-EVs. Total aggregate retailer profit from new-vehicle sales for this month is projected to be $2.2 billion, down 7.7% from last year.

“Subprime mix had been on a steady upward trajectory this year, topping out at 9.8% in October, the highest of any month since March 2020. Subprime mix fell slightly from October to 8.9% in November, still 2.8 percentage points higher than November 2024.

“The industry enters the holiday sales season facing a mix of affordability challenges, evolving incentive strategies and lingering effects from the EV pull-ahead earlier this year. While interest rates have eased and used-vehicle values remain strong—providing some support for trade-in equity—the number of leases set to expire in December is projected to be more than 15% lower than the same period a year ago and 50% lower than in 2023, thus limiting the typical year-end boost. Automakers are expected to maintain disciplined pricing and restrained incentives, particularly in non-EV segments, as they balance profitability with the need to stimulate demand. How aggressively manufacturers choose to adjust discounting and promotional activity during December will be critical in shaping the close of 2025.”

Electrification Outlook

Tyson Jominy, senior vice president of OEM customer success at J.D. Power:

“The electric vehicle (EV) market is entering a new phase following the end of federal incentives, with November data signaling a shift in consumer behavior and industry dynamics. EV retail share has stabilized at 6.0%, flat from October but notably lower than last year’s 9.6%. Plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) have seen an even steeper decline, dropping to 1.1% from 2.5% a year ago, underscoring the challenges facing electrified powertrains in a post-incentive environment.

“Pricing trends further highlight the evolving landscape. EV transaction prices have surged by $6,500 year over year to $52,400, making them the second most expensive powertrain after PHEVs, which now average $64,300, a jump of $8,400. In contrast, internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles average $46,000, while traditional hybrids remain the most affordable option at $42,200. Despite these price increases, automakers continue to rely heavily on incentives to drive EV sales, with average support of $6,220 per vehicle, the highest among all powertrains.

“Leasing remains a critical lever for EV adoption, with 54% of EV transactions occurring through leases, far outpacing ICE vehicles at 20% and hybrids at 15%. While EV incentive spending has moderated compared to a year ago, the reliance on leasing and discounts underscores the challenges automakers face. As the market adjusts to life without federal tax credits, manufacturers will need to rethink go-to-market strategies to balance affordability, profitability, and consumer demand in this new paradigm.”

Global Sales Outlook

David Oakley, manager, Americas vehicle sales forecasts at GlobalData:

“October global light-vehicle sales are estimated to have increased 3.1% year over year to 8.2 million units, despite some mixed results across major regions. The selling rate for October was estimated at 95.9 million units, up from a downwardly revised 92.3 million units in September.

“China, India and Europe contributed the most to year over year sales gains in October. Although government subsidies and tax incentives in China are being wound down, there was still sufficient demand to deliver year over year growth in October, with new energy vehicles accounting for more than half of all sales. Tax reductions and holiday sales events spurred strong sales in India. In Europe, sales in Turkey increased sharply as consumers sought to invest in vehicles to guard against inflation.

“November sales are expected to decrease 3.9% from November 2024. In part, this is a reflection of a relatively strong month in November 2024. However, tariff effects and economic uncertainty are expected to play a part in subduing demand in Europe and North America, while China could see a slight slowdown as subsidies ease. The global selling rate is expected to reach 92.7 million units in November, down from a rate of 95.8 million units in November 2024.

“Overall, global trade appears to have stabilized slightly over the past month, with some progress made on resolving the Nexperia chip crisis. Despite some uncertainty remaining over the health of the global economy, we see total 2025 sales at 91.4 million units, up by around 200,000 from our forecast a month ago and representing growth of 3.0% year over year.”

The loan, issued through the Energy Department’s Loan Programs Office (LPO), was awarded to Constellation Energy (CEG), the nation’s largest nuclear power operator. The unit, which was shut down in 2019 due to economic pressures from cheap natural gas, will be revived under the new name Crane Clean Energy Center.

The revival is largely enabled by a 20-year, $16 billion power purchase agreement with Microsoft, which is seeking large-scale, carbon-free electricity to power its energy-intensive AI data centers. The deal ensures a stable revenue stream for the project and underscores the growing partnership between Big Tech and nuclear energy.

Following the announcement, Constellation Energy’s stock rose 5% in after-hours trading.

Once operational, the 800-megawatt reactor will supply enough electricity to power approximately 800,000 homes in the PJM Interconnection region, one of the largest U.S. power grids. The project is expected to enhance grid reliability, provide affordable baseload power, and create more than 600 jobs.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the initiative will “provide affordable, reliable, and secure energy to Americans across the Mid-Atlantic region” and “help ensure America has the energy it needs to grow its domestic manufacturing base and win the AI race.”

Thomas Hochman, Director of Energy & Infrastructure Policy at the Foundation for American Innovation, highlighted the broader significance of the deal. He noted it is the first LPO loan specifically addressing AI-driven electricity load growth and represents a novel partnership model between a tech firm and an energy developer. Hochman also emphasized that the power will flow into the public grid, benefiting all ratepayers and strengthening system-wide reserves.

The project signals a strategic pivot by the U.S. to expand its nuclear energy capacity amid intensifying global competition, particularly with China, which has taken a significant lead in nuclear development. Constellation plans to invest roughly $1.6 billion to bring the reactor back online between 2027 and 2028.

Prime determinants of growth

The rise in the sale of electric vehicles as well as the lack of standardization of EV charging and the greater need for convenience drives the growth of the global portable EV charger market. Limitations associated with the existing electric vehicle charging infrastructure also boost the growth of the portable EV charger market. Greater adoption of portable EV chargers is expected during the forecast period to address range anxiety associated with electric vehicles among consumers. However, the superior cost of portable EV chargers is anticipated to restrict the market growth during the forecast period. Moreover, greater demand for mobile charging as a service and the rise in adoption of shared mobility are expected to present new opportunities in the coming years. Market players are increasingly investing in the development of advanced wireless, bi-directional fast chargers to cater to the growing demand for portable EV chargers during the forecast period.

Covid-19 Scenario

The outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic led to the closing of international borders and disruption in the supply chain, which reduced demand for electric vehicles worldwide, thereby leading to decreased demand for portable EV chargers.

The pandemic resulted in a continued reduction in the adoption of portable electric vehicle chargers due to nationwide lockdowns and a slowdown in shipments due to temporary closures of manufacturing facilities. The COVID-19 pandemic halted overall nationwide mobility.

The automotive industry has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the disruption negatively impacted the demand for electric vehicles which further reduced the growth of the portable electric vehicle charger market.

However, with ease in COVID-19 restrictions, the global portable EV charger market is expected to experience growth on account of the rise in the adoption of electric vehicles and the introduction of stringent emission regulations by countries across the world.

The DC portable EV charger segment to maintain its leadership status throughout the forecast period

Based on type, the DC portable EV charger segment is expected to hold the highest market share in 2025, accounting for nearly three-fourths of the global portable EV charger market, and is estimated to maintain its leadership status throughout the forecast period. With a DC charger, direct current is supplied directly to the battery, bypassing the onboard charger. DC fast charging is essential for high-mileage heavy vehicles. The rise in the need for portable anytime/anyplace charging drives the growth of DC chargers in the market. It is also projected to manifest the highest CAGR of 20.7% from 2026 to 2035.

The passenger cars segment to maintain its lead position during the forecast period

Based on application, the passenger cars segment is expected to account for the largest share in 2025, accounting for more than three-fourths of the global portable EV charger market, and is projected to maintain its lead position during the forecast period. There is an increase in the development of portable electric vehicle chargers for passenger vehicles to reduce mileage and range anxiety among consumers. The rise in demand for electric passenger vehicles owing to the increase in awareness of environmental impacts due to emissions of greenhouse gases, and the implementation of favorable government policies support the growth of this segment. However, the commercial vehicle segment is expected to portray the highest CAGR of 22.1% from 2026 to 2035.

Asia-Pacific to maintain its dominance by 2035

Based on region, Asia-Pacific is expected to hold the highest market share in terms of revenue in 2025, accounting for more than two-fifth of the global portable EV charger market, and is likely to dominate the market during the forecast period. Asia-Pacific possesses high market potential owing to the rapid upsurge in the number of electric vehicles in countries such as China, India, and Japan. Several government initiatives for the development of electric vehicle charging are expected to boost the growth of the portable EV charger market in this region. Moreover, huge investments in the expansion of the electric vehicle industry are expected to drive the growth of the market. However, the Europe region is expected to witness the highest CAGR of 21.2% from 2026 to 2035.

There have been 11 GW of batteries and 8 GW of demand response resources added to the bulk power system since last winter, NERC said.
“Essentially, you have a doubling between the last several successive [winter reliability assessments],” said Mark Olson, NERC’s manager of reliability assessment.
Solar nameplate capacity rose 11 GW since last winter, but is expected to contribute only about 1 GW towards meeting peak demand.
In the Maritimes region, imports may be needed to meet peak demand, NERC said.","Dive Brief:

Peak demand on the bulk power system will be 20 GW higher this winter than last, but total resources to meet the peak have only increased 9.4 GW, according to a report released Tuesday by the North American Electric Reliability Corp.

Despite the mismatch, all regions of the bulk power system should have sufficient resources for expected peak demand this winter, NERC said in its 2025-2026 Winter Reliability Assessment. However, several regions could face challenges in the event of extreme weather.

There have been 11 GW of batteries and 8 GW of demand response resources added to the bulk power system since last winter, NERC said. Solar, thermal and hydro have also seen small additions, but contributions from wind resources are 14 GW lower following capacity accounting changes in some markets.

Dive Insight:

NERC officials described a mixed bag heading into the winter season.

“The bulk power system is entering another winter with pockets of elevated risk, and the drivers are becoming more structural than seasonal,” said John Moura, NERC’s director of reliability assessments and performance analysis. “We’re seeing steady demand growth, faster than previous years, landing on a system that’s still racing to build new resources, navigating supply chain constraints and integrating large amounts of variable, inverter-based generation.”

Aggregate peak demand across NERC’s footprint will be 20 GW, or 2.5%, higher than last winter. “Essentially, you have a doubling between the last several successive [winter reliability assessments],” said Mark Olson, NERC’s manager of reliability assessment.

Nearly all of NERC’s assessment areas “are reporting year-on-year demand growth with some forecasting increases near 10%,” the reliability watchdog said.

The U.S. West, Southeast and Mid-Atlantic — areas with significant data center development — have highest growth rates, NERC said. “Demand growth is contributing to lower reserve margins and signaling need for more resources,” according to a presentation on the report.

But some types of new resource additions are slow to come online. Just 3 GW of thermal or hydro generation was added since last winter. Solar nameplate capacity rose 11 GW since last winter, but is expected to contribute only about 1 GW towards meeting peak demand.

Bringing resources online more quickly will require changes to policy and markets, according to the Electric Power Supply Association.

“We need permitting reform, predictable market rules, and policies that support private investment,” EPSA President and CEO Todd Snitchler said in a statement. The group represents competitive generators.

An increasingly complex resource mix “brings additional challenges for operators,” NERC said, particularly in extreme or extended cold weather.

In the Maritimes region, imports may be needed to meet peak demand, NERC said. New England could see gas shortages in extended extreme conditions. In areas of the Southeast, reserves may not be sufficient for high demand scenarios, or resource shortages may occur during early morning hours with high demand.

In the Electric Reliability Council of Texas footprint, “strong load growth is contributing to continued risk of supply shortfalls in extreme cold,” NERC said. In parts of the Northwest, resources may not be sufficient during wide-area cold weather that causes thermal plant outages and wind performance issues.

“Winter reliability is improving in some aspects, but the system is still being tested by conditions outside historical norms,” Moura said.

NERC’s assessment includes several recommendations: grid operators should review seasonal operating plans; generation owners should complete winter readiness and weatherization efforts; and balancing authorities should implement generator fuel surveys to monitor the adequacy of fuel supplies.

“Gas production and supplies going to generators strongly impacts how well the bulk power system can perform during winter conditions,” Olson said. “These two systems are inextricably linked.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/zTl-JK6msJj1PKbDkjjwu-lcNJ_LQb7DbDWHdfqJqME/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9JY2Vfc3Rvcm0uanBn.webp,N,,2025-11-20 10:01:33.028609

As a part of Toyota’s recent commitment to invest up to $10 billion in the U.S. over the next five years, the company has announced a $912 million investment across five manufacturing plants. The goal is to increase hybrid capacity and bring hybrid-electric Corollas to the OEM’s production lineup, according to a press release.

The changes will also create 252 new jobs.

The investment will be made in Toyota’s West Virginia, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Missouri plants.

“Customers are embracing Toyota’s hybrid vehicles, and our U.S. manufacturing teams are gearing up to meet that growing demand,” said Kevin Voelkel, Toyota’s manufacturing operations senior vice president, in the release.

“Toyota’s philosophy is to build where we sell, and by adding more American jobs and investing across our U.S. footprint, we continue to stay true to that philosophy.”

Toyota West Virginia

Toyota’s Buffalo, West Virginia, plant will add 80 jobs to increase assembly of four-cylinder hybrid-compatible engines, sixth-generation hybrid transaxles, and rear motor stators.

The $453 million expansion is slated to begin with 2027 production and includes new shift patterns to improve efficiency, the release says.

Toyota West Virginia assembles more than 1 million engines, transmissions, and hybrid transaxles annually.

Toyota Kentucky

Toyota’s largest plant globally, located in Georgetown, Kentucky, will add 82 jobs and install an all-new machining line for four-cylinder hybrid-compatible engines, lining off in 2027.

The powertrain facility assembles up to 700,000 units annually. Toyota Kentucky employs nearly 10,000 team members. The new investment will be $204.4 million.

Toyota Mississippi

Toyota’s Blue Springs, Mississippi, plant will add the hybrid-electric Corolla, marking the first electrified Corollas assembled in the U.S.

The plant employs 2,400 people. The new investment in the plant is $125 million.

Toyota Tennessee

Thirty-three jobs will be added to Toyota’s casting plant in Jackson, Tennessee, as part of a $71.4 million investment.

Toyota plans to increase production of hybrid transaxle cases and housings and engine blocks for hybrid vehicles at the plant. The investment includes three new production lines and will increase annual production capacity by nearly 500,000 units. Production on the new lines is scheduled to start in 2027 and 2028.

Toyota Missouri

Toyota’s $57.1 million investment in its casting plant in Troy, Missouri, will add 57 jobs and a new cylinder head production line for hybrid vehicles.

Production on the new line is slated to begin in 2027 and is expected to increase plant capacity by more than 200,000 cylinder heads annually.

The release adds that Toyota’s North American manufacturing facilities assemble 76% of the vehicles it sells in the U.S.

“Toyota’s multi-pathway powertrain approach continues to drive steady growth in electrified vehicles, including hybrids, plug-ins and all-electric, which now account for nearly 50% of the company’s U.S. sales,” the release says.

The Toyota USA Foundation also recently launched Driving Possibilities, its $110 million initiative to support PreK-12 education and beyond.

The long-term program aims to close educational gaps through innovative, hands-on STEM learning while addressing the essential needs of students and families.

Earlier this month, Toyota announced the start of production at its new battery plant in North Carolina, along with a commitment to an additional $10 billion U.S. investment, according to a company press release.

In their minds, she’d been set up for a traditional college experience, leading to a stable government job. But in hers, a desk job was unappealing. She loved working with hair and knew she had the talent and drive to build a serious career in the beauty industry.

But the criticism was intense, complete with warnings that she would bring shame to the family. To appease them, she did everything, at full speed.

After graduating from Kaimuki Christian School, Umebayashi earned an associate degree in cosmetology at Honolulu Community College while training at Marsha Nadalin Salon in Kāhala, where she had worked since she was 15. She also got licensed as a cosmetologist.

She then jumped into business administration at UH Mānoa, packing her schedule with 18 hours of credits each semester, and 12 hours each summer, while continuing to work at the salon. The academic marathon ended with a bachelor’s degree in 2020.

“I wanted to be done with school,” she says. “I was motivated to never step foot in a classroom ever again.”

Her instinct to pursue the trades and specialty skills is shared by many Gen Zers across the country, who are flocking to traditional apprenticeships and trade schools. In Hawai‘i, the trend is less pronounced, but the opportunities are immense. Employers in construction, manufacturing, health care, clean energy and other sectors are eager to hire skilled employees – and they earn higher salaries and carry less debt than many people with four-year degrees.

For Umebayashi, the financial payoff came quickly. At the salon, she worked early mornings to late nights on commission, breaking six figures in annual earnings. She put some of that money into a reduced-priced “workforce” unit at a new high-rise condo in Kaka‘ako, which she was offered in a housing lottery.

In January, at age 27, she became a self-employed stylist, renting space at Oasis Salon in Kaimukī. She says her current pace is less frenetic and better for her work-life balance, but she doesn’t let herself become satisfied or complacent.

“It’s not wise when you’re in your 20s to feel comfortable,” she says. “You should feel uncomfortable, you should take risks. … I thought I would be a millionaire at 25, so I feel like I’m behind. I’ve always had a fire under me.”

Umebayashi is paying off her mortgage as aggressively as possible. Even good debt troubles her, and she takes a very “full throttle, unconventional” approach to investing in hopes of being debt-free and financially secure. She also plans to open a salon of her own.

Despite her restlessness, she realizes she’s in a pretty good spot. She says she sees many of her peers burdened with student loans and struggling to find jobs, with no clear paths forward.

“Our education system makes it seem like college is this great promise to a good life and a good future, but often it can be the opposite,” she says. “You start behind other people who don’t take on debt.”

More money, less debt

From a career perspective, Umebayashi’s skepticism about the benefits of a traditional college experience is not off-base, particularly in Hawai‘i where four-year degrees lead to less income and opportunity than in any other state.

Five years after graduating, only 43% of four-year college graduates in Hawai‘i have jobs that typically require bachelor’s degrees – the lowest percentage in the U.S. – according to a 2024 report from the Strada Education Foundation. Maryland had the highest percentage, at 60%.

And jobs that pay a living wage are scarce. Matt Stevens, a data scientist and executive director of Hawai‘i Workforce Funders Collaborative, says: “We’re 50th in the nation as to how much you can expect to earn at every educational attainment level, adjusted for cost of living. And when you get to the four-year degree, it’s actually off-the-charts low. We’re a statistical outlier.”

The state Department of Labor and Industrial Relations estimates, in uncannily precise terms, that 377,760 jobs will open in Hawai‘i between 2020 and 2030. But less than a third, or 120,290 job openings, are projected to pay at least a “living wage” of $56,841 for a single adult with no children, according to “From Crisis to Opportunity,” a report published in January by the Hawai‘i Workforce Funders Collaborative. The MIT living wage calculator recently upped that amount to $62,234.

The nonprofit collaborative calls attention to the problem of low-quality jobs and advocates for better jobs with better pay. In the process, it brings business, government, nonprofit and educational leaders together to figure out how to do that.

Community colleges in the UH system have responded with a dizzying array of short-term training and credentialing programs alongside core humanities classes and two-year degree programs. Many are new programs developed with input from employers.

“The fact is that a high school diploma is no longer enough. Students have to do something post-graduation, and there are so many options at the community colleges,” says Karen Lee, chancellor of Honolulu Community College. About 3,700 students are enrolled at HCC, which has seen its numbers steadily increase after dropping during the pandemic. That trend is similar across the UH System.

Many practical two-year associate degrees lead to trade careers, viewed broadly as skilled work requiring specialized training and often a license. People straight out of school or training programs can earn $100,000 or more – and live far more comfortable lives than a living wage provides, which would barely cover a decent one-bedroom rental, a compact car and fresh food.

The young pragmatists gravitating to the trades are sometimes called the toolbelt generation, and they’re looking for financial freedom, an escape from office life, and jobs that are less likely to be disrupted by technology and economic downturns.

Mechatronics: demand exceeds supply

In a set of unassuming temporary buildings at Leeward Community College, students are wiring control boxes based on detailed schematics. Other rooms are filled with elaborate machines and tools for learning about sensors, robotics, control systems, computer-integrated machinery and other technology.

William Labby, an assistant professor at LCC, founded the mechatronics program to fill a specific workforce need – technicians to maintain Honolulu’s driverless trains – and it’s since blossomed into a two-year program, leading to an associate of science degree. He chafes at the “trades” label and explains that his students gain high-level math and troubleshooting skills that complement the design skills of engineers.

“Engineers and highly skilled technicians are two sides of the same coin,” he says. “Engineers are design oriented, while technicians deal with installation, maintenance, retooling, reprogramming and all the follow-on functions behind the engineering design.”

About half the mechatronics graduates are hired by Hitachi, which installs and maintains the operating system for Skyline’s trains. For the others, Labby says, companies are coming “out of the woodwork” to talk to his students, with many landing jobs at medical imaging companies, military contractors, Cirque du Soleil and the Ball Corp. in Kapolei. He says new hires at Ball, which makes 12-ounce cans, start out at about $85,000 a year, with lots of overtime opportunities.

“Automation is a growth industry in the state. We’re going to get more and more automated with all of our small food and beverage manufacturing companies,” says Labby. “Most companies would rather hire local, and now that word is getting out about this program, I’m getting more of a push for graduates. Demand exceeds my supply.”

While 22 students are enrolled in the program now, Labby says he has the capacity for 40. The obstacle is high school college counselors. “The message they convey is that if you don’t go to a four-year school, you fail, and that is not the case,” he says.

A fourth-semester student, Christian Smith, just landed a job with a military contractor, and negotiated to work part time until he graduates. Before joining the program, he was a helicopter mechanic with the military, and says he now has “a better, deeper understanding of how things work.”

Another student, Ramsey Agustin, graduated from Damien Memorial School in 2022 and spent his freshman year at Oregon State University studying mechanical engineering. Formidable out-of-state tuition and housing costs forced him to return home.

He’s now completing his final semester in the mechatronics program while also working at a machine shop in Pearl City, and he looks forward to getting a better-paid job soon and eventually finishing his bachelor’s degree.

Agustin finds the classes challenging but manageable. “I haven’t ever felt like we’re being lectured too much, which is helpful,” he says. “About 70% of the classes have been mostly hands-on, which is better for some people. I like it.”

RadTech: a reverse pipeline

More than half of Kapi‘olani Community College’s students move on to four-year universities, says Misaki Takabayashi, the college’s chancellor. But some programs are so sought-after that the pipeline is reversed: people with bachelor’s degrees head to KCC for an additional associate degree.

The radiologic technology program is one of them. Two of the three students I spoke with already had degrees from UH Mānoa: Aura Coffman in animal science and Garrison Hiramatsu in elementary education. Neither felt that their choices suited them, and they were drawn to the prospect of a well-paid career with defined hours and tasks. A third student, Breanne Yang, says she always wanted to work in health care, but got sidetracked in restaurant jobs.

About 25% of applicants are accepted, with decisions based on an admissions test and grades from prerequisite courses taken in their first year. In the second year, selected students focus on how to safely image the human body using X-ray equipment and gain practical experience in health care settings.

Along with respiratory care, radiologic technology is the most popular program in the college’s health care division, and offers the highest pay. The entry-level hourly wage is $45 on O‘ahu, and a technologist with a couple of years’ experience earns about $92,000 annually, according to Program Director Kimberly Suwa. Very experienced or specialized technologists, such as those working in mammography or radiation therapy, earn about $112,000, she says.

When high schoolers tour the campus, those figures usually impress them. “They obviously understand that there is a large discrepancy between what you can make at McDonald’s versus what you can make as a technologist,” Suwa says. “But I don’t know if they fully understand the impact of being able to do a two-year degree as opposed to having to go to a four-year college.”

For one thing, the community colleges in the UH System charge $131 per credit hour for in-state students, or about $2,000 a semester for a full 15-hour course load. Tuition at UH Mānoa is $441 per credit, or about $6,600 per semester for a similar load.

Despite the lower cost, and access to scholarships and federal financial aid, more students than in the past seem to have outside jobs, says Jodi Ann Nakaoka, the chair of KCC’s health sciences department. She says the department cautions students to eliminate or minimize their work hours because the program is intense, but Hawai‘i’s high cost of living increasingly makes that impossible.

AERO: training super mechanics

At the end of Lagoon Drive, a shoreline road snaking along the eastern edge of the Honolulu airport, young men and a handful of women are training to become airplane mechanics at Honolulu Community College’s aeronautics maintenance technology program.

Vintage and modern planes line the perimeter of the building, and engines and tools fill the interior workshops. All of the aircraft have been donated, including a small Cessna 172, a replica of an old crop duster, and a DC-9 with its engine removed but airframe intact.

Teams of students are taking engines apart and putting them back together, and learning how to diagnose and fix problems that the faculty have introduced. Much of the classroom instruction gets translated into projects, such as constructing a cross-section of a plane’s wing based on blueprints.

Instructor Brian Quinto drills the students on the importance of safety and attention to detail. “We’re often compared to auto mechanics. No denigration to them, but if something goes wrong with your car, you just pull over.” Signing off on repairs becomes a legal document, he explains to students, and planes aren’t cleared to take off until the mechanic says so.

Andy Tran, a second-year student in the program, says “there’s a big learning curve for the program. The more I learn, the harder it is to fix things.”

“Many of the new students are like deer in the headlights because it comes at you really fast, but we have a lot to teach in a relatively short amount of time,” explains Mike Willett, the lead instructor at the AERO program. It’s one of Honolulu Community College’s most popular offerings, with about 75 current students and more than a hundred on a growing waitlist.

Tran took a sheet-metal course at HCC during the year he waited for a spot to open up. He says he loves everything about aviation, but mechanical training is much cheaper and more accessible than flight school.

The schedule runs for seven hours, four days a week, and leads to an associate of science degree. At the end of the two-year program, the pass rate for first-time test takers seeking FAA certification exceeds the national average, says Willett.

Like the radiologic technology program at KCC, many of the students have outside jobs. Micah Holmberg, who used to repair motorcycles and manufacturing equipment, attends the full-time program, then works as a full-time aircraft mechanic helper nearby. At the end of his double shifts, he travels home to the North Shore.

Hawaiian Airlines regularly opens slots for its part-time paid apprenticeship program for AERO students, and a new scholarship program offers students financial assistance and mentorship. Both were developed to fill openings at Hawaiian caused by retirements. Willett says graduates are also hired by companies such as Hawaii Air Cargo, Swissport and United Airlines, and they leave the program with advanced mechanical skills they can take anywhere.

An apprenticeship changed his life

Drew Maberry works long hours as a journeyman millwright, a job that goes back to classical antiquity when skilled carpenters designed and built water mills. Today, millwrights install, maintain, repair and reassemble machinery used in factories, power plants and construction sites.

On the day we spoke, Maberry had just returned from Par Hawaii, where he was welding large platforms on top of the existing plant in Kapolei. His employer, APB, short for American Piping & Boiler Co., has been contracted by Par to upgrade the facility.

He sets the scene of his jobsite: “I’m wearing fire-resistant clothes and a head sock and gloves. I’m basically covered head to toe, with a hard hat that I change into welding headgear. And I’m two stories high,” welding in the blistering sun of Kapolei.

While the job is strenuous, the pay is good, at $55 an hour, and the benefits are great. With overtime, Maberry’s weekly check is more than he ever imagined he could make when he left high school in Missouri, feeling “lost” and stuck in low-wage retail jobs.

In his mid-20s, Maberry moved to Waimānalo, where his father had relocated. He worked in restaurants for a while, then decided he needed a “career job” so he could live on his own.

After passing math and physical tests, he got a traditional carpentry apprenticeship with the Hawaii Carpenters Apprenticeship & Training Fund, then switched to the union’s millwright apprenticeship when it opened for the first time in 2020.

The past decade has seen a sharp increase in active registered apprenticeships nationwide, from 359,388 in 2015 to over 696,205 in 2025, according to data from the U.S. Department of Labor. Hawai‘i’s trend line is less robust, with a steep decline in apprenticeships in 2022, though those numbers have inched up in the past couple of years. In 2025, there are 6,094 active apprenticeships in the state, of which about 85% are in construction, 11% in manufacturing and the rest in a smattering of other industries.

Maberry recently completed his apprenticeship’s required 8,000 hours of work and weekly classes, which earned him the official title of journeyman millwright.

Some of his apprenticeship jobs were challenging, he says, including 12-hour days at AES when it was still a coal-fired power plant, with no days off. “I probably have black lung from welding in tight spaces at AES and shoveling dust, or whatever it was,” he says with a laugh.

And he’s worked with plenty of old-school “tough-love” guys, but says that he’s “fortunate that my boss at APB is so understanding and good at dealing with different personalities, which is important because it can be such long hours and grueling work.”

Despite the job’s ups and downs, Maberry says he’s finally financially comfortable and able to provide for his 5-year-old son. And he feels optimistic about the future: “I think about how far I’ve come and I just want to keep learning and building.”

Alternate on-the-job training routes

Beyond Hawai‘i’s dozens of skilled apprenticeships (see the list at tinyurl.com/hiapprentice) spanning from bricklayers to elevator constructors, some large private companies offer their own paid training programs.

Hawaiian Electric’s apprenticeship program, for example, trains people to be linemen, electricians, maintenance mechanics, and maintenance or substation electricians. The program pairs apprentices with experienced journeymen, and supplements on-the-job training with classroom or online instruction. Apprentices are hired based on written and physical tests.

About 250 employees on O‘ahu and in Maui County have completed the program since 2009, and 22 on Hawai‘i Island since 2017, according to Communications Manager Darren Pai. “Establishing our own training programs allows us to address skilled labor shortages, such as linemen, and maintain high safety standards,” he explains in an email.

The more than century-old Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard apprenticeship is the most popular program at Honolulu Community College; it provides the academic component for an associate of applied science degree upon completion.

Other apprenticeships are more informal. The 29-year-old who repaired my refrigerator says he discovered the trade circuitously. He studied environmental science at the University of Montana, then returned home to Hawai‘i Island and started a landscaping business.

After a few years, he decided to do something “less strenuous and more analytical” and mentored with a seasoned HVAC and appliance repair professional on Hawai‘i Island. Eventually, he branched out on his own in Honolulu, where he says the job is “humbling and stressful sometimes, but the fun is in learning new things and diagnosing problems.”

Reaching the other 50%

While apprenticeships and associate degrees are established routes to good jobs, Hawai‘i’s community colleges also offer short-term vocational training. The programs fill a training gap in the Islands since most private vocational schools only teach massage therapy, according to the state Department of Education’s list of licensed schools. And in June, the two Job Corps training centers on O‘ahu and Maui were terminated by the U.S. Department of Labor, along with 97 others across the country.

Short-term training lets participants sample careers, build foundational skills or upskill into better-paying jobs in a variety of areas. For example:

LCC offers commercial driver courses, as does the Hawaiian Council through its Hawaiian Trades Academy.

KCC recently contracted with the Kahala Hotel & Resort to develop training for employees who want to advance into midlevel leadership roles.

HCC launched a summer program that brings high schoolers to campus to try out three career and technical education options.

The Building Industry Association of Hawai‘i offers free pre-apprenticeship training that covers math, blueprint reading and the fundamentals of the trade.

UH Maui College and Hawaiian Electric created a free training program that can lead to jobs at power-generating stations.

High schools across the Islands have introduced career and technical education that helps students gain real-world skills and work experience.

The UH community colleges’ Good Jobs Hawai‘i initiative helps coordinate and fund many of these programs, using $35 million in federal Covid-recovery grants and private philanthropy. Program Manager Nicolette van der Lee says that grant funding runs out next year, but the state Legislature will continue to fund free, noncredit courses for those seeking careers as commercial drivers, nursing aides, information technologists and other high-demand positions.

The Good Jobs program targets the nearly 50% of residents who forgo college and other formal training.

“We’ve been seeking to connect with them and show that you don’t have to have a job in the hotel industry working as a server, or some other entry-level job that doesn’t have a pathway to a living wage,” says Van der Lee.

Early results are promising

A preliminary study shows that short-term training has a positive impact. Hawai‘i residents who completed Good Jobs training were making, on average, about 12% more six months after completing the program, according to a July 7 blog post on the UH Economic Research Organization’s website.

Among those employed before the program, 38% ended up moving to a different industry, where they saw even higher income gains. The biggest gains were for people switching to the health care industry, which the report says saw “average quarterly wage increases approaching $4,000,” or about $16,000 annually.

Younger participants just entering the workplace found jobs in industries “with stronger wage potential, often linked to their training,” according to the blog post.

Van der Lee says the Good Jobs initiative is part of a thriving workforce development ecosystem in Hawai‘i, spearheaded by the state Workforce Development Council. “We want to change the narrative that says you have to leave Hawai‘i for more education and opportunity,” says Van der Lee. “We’re trying to create the education and training infrastructure here, and also the employment opportunities individuals need to get the good jobs so they can stay.”

A troubled economy

Anna Pacheco, president and CEO at AE Consulting, has spent more than a decade researching education and workforce challenges, and consulting with local organizations. She sees unprecedented opportunities now in trade careers, driven by a wave of retirements.

“It has really put us into a talent crunch,” she says. “We’ve got this huge gap with the more senior folks leaving positions and the younger generation not entering them at the speed we need to fill those gaps. And the problem is becoming more and more profound.”

Like Labby from LCC, she says the predominant message that young people hear is to go to college, get a four-year degree and land a professional job.

“The reality is that our economy relies heavily on those trades positions,” Pacheco says. “I think we’re at an inflection point where we need to get students into those careers because if we don’t, we’re not going to reach our clean energy goals or our housing goals.”

While the prospects are promising for people with practical skills in the trades, the picture for recent four-year college graduates is blurrier. The current hiring slowdown, with new jobs only trickling into the U.S. economy, can hit recent graduates the hardest.

Students who majored in computer science, for instance – once seen as a sure bet, complete with snarky “learn to code” comments to English majors – are now the ones who are often bemoaning their job prospects. Today, 6.1% of recent graduates in computer science and 7.5% of computer engineering majors are unemployed – some of the highest rates of all college majors, according to recent data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

Popular majors such as environmental studies now have higher underemployment rates than art history majors, with 49% working in jobs that don’t require a bachelor’s degree. Even new graduates in journalism have significantly less underemployment, at 36%.

In Hawai‘i, UHERO economists see the state slipping into a mild recession in 2026, the result of federal layoffs and less consumer spending and tourism due to tariffs and inflation. Only construction remains resilient, according to UHERO’s September 2025 forecast.

While higher education is always valuable, and often the pathway to a prosperous, fulfilling life, that path can be long, winding and expensive. Quicker, more direct routes are launching many of Hawai‘i’s young adults into rewarding careers, and with fewer financial risks – a big advantage in uncertain times.",https://wpcdn.us-east-1.vip.tn-cloud.net/www.hawaiibusiness.com/content/uploads/2025/11/f/y/hero-hawaiis-young-pragmatists-are-choosing-trades-over-college-and-making-six-figures.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 12:01:30.360489

With billions invested and decades of work ahead, new energy construction jobs offer stability, growth, and purpose.","A new kind of construction boom is here — one powered by clean energy. Across continents, solar farms, wind projects, nuclear plants, and energy storage sites are creating millions of jobs. The shift is about rebuilding how the world works, one project at a time.

The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) reports that over 13.7 million people worked in renewables in 2023. As nations aim for net-zero emissions, that number is climbing fast. Governments and investors are pouring trillions into clean infrastructure. Every solar array, wind farm, and storage facility needs workers — and that means opportunity.

Why Are Renewable Energy Construction Jobs Booming?

Clean energy spending hit record highs in 2024. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates global investment in new energy construction surpassed $3.3 trillion, up 25% in just two years.

That surge has unleashed a flood of hiring across solar, wind, nuclear, and battery projects. For every $1 billion invested in renewables, 7,000–8,000 jobs are created. From electricians and welders to engineers and project managers, demand is outpacing supply.

In the U.S., solar installer jobs are projected to grow 22% by 2030, while wind turbine technicians could see 45% growth — among the fastest in any industry.

Solar Construction: The Fastest-Growing Field in Clean Energy

No sector is expanding faster than solar farm construction. These massive installations employ thousands — electricians, civil engineers, heavy equipment operators, and project supervisors — all working together to turn sunlight into power.

Over 5.8 million people now work in solar energy worldwide, according to IRENA. Nearly half are directly involved in building or maintaining solar plants. And with new projects breaking ground every week, job security in this field is strong.

Falling panel prices and government incentives are driving solar’s rise. The U.S. alone added over 35 GW of solar capacity in 2024, creating tens of thousands of new positions. In the Middle East and North Africa, countries like Saudi Arabia and Morocco are building record-breaking solar farms as part of national diversification plans.

A solar project can take years to build and decades to maintain. That means long-term, well-paid careers in a growing industry.

Skills That Power Solar Careers

Modern solar construction blends technology and craftsmanship. Top skills include:

Electrical & Mechanical Work: Wiring, inverters, and energy control systems.

Civil & Structural Engineering: Designing stable racking and foundation systems.

Project Management: Coordinating hundreds of workers and materials.

Digital Monitoring: Managing data through smart sensors and automation tools.

In the U.S., solar construction workers earn $22–$45 per hour, while engineers and managers can make $80,000–$130,000 annually.

The Quiet Comeback Of Nuclear Energy Construction

While renewables grab headlines, nuclear construction is quietly rising again. New-generation designs — Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) — are faster to build, safer to operate, and key to reliable zero-carbon power.

Over 70 new reactors are under construction worldwide. Major projects include Hinkley Point C in the UK and Vogtle Units 3 & 4 in the U.S. Each employs thousands of engineers, technicians, and welders.

Nuclear construction careers demand precision and training. Common roles include:

Civil and structural engineers

Mechanical and welding technicians

Instrumentation and control specialists

Quality assurance and safety inspectors

These roles pay among the highest in the energy sector — often $100,000 to $150,000+ annually.

Battery Storage Projects: The Backbone of Renewable Power

Every solar or wind project needs storage to balance supply and demand. That’s where battery energy storage construction comes in.

Global investment in storage projects topped $40 billion in 2024, and capacity is set to triple by 2030. Each site employs hundreds of skilled tradespeople — electricians, data technicians, and systems engineers — who install and maintain large-scale lithium-ion systems.

Major initiatives like Tesla’s Megapack projects in California and Australia, or Europe’s Grid Booster systems, are hiring rapidly.

Typical roles include:

Battery System Technicians

Thermal Management Engineers

Data Integration Specialists

Pay is strong — often $80,000–$120,000 or more for experienced professionals.

Wind Power and Hybrid Sites: Clean Energy’s Dynamic Duo

Wind energy remains a cornerstone of the renewable boom. Together, wind and solar construction careers form the largest share of global clean energy jobs.

A growing trend is hybrid sites, where wind and solar share infrastructure and connect to battery storage. These projects keep power flowing day and night and demand cross-trained workers.

In this field, flexibility is gold. Electricians, crane operators, site supervisors, and data engineers who understand both technologies are in especially high demand.

The Leading Companies Behind the Clean Energy Boom

Leading construction giants are shifting toward renewables.

Bechtel is spearheading nuclear and wind projects.

Fluor is expanding into hydrogen and solar infrastructure.

Black & Veatch and Siemens Energy are building next-gen storage systems and renewable networks worldwide.

These firms are where innovation meets opportunity, employing millions and training the next generation of clean energy professionals.

Conclusion

The clean energy transition is more than a movement — it’s a rebuild of global industry. From solar farms to nuclear reactors and battery systems, construction workers are shaping a cleaner, smarter, and more sustainable world.

With billions invested and decades of work ahead, new energy construction jobs offer stability, growth, and purpose. The clean energy future isn’t coming — it’s being built right now, by people ready to power the next century.",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f4f9895e09c563a9267f110/6091d107ffce520f80fea142/691eb264eba8833632dd6bca/1763642390250/teamwork-engineer-worker.jpg?format=1500w,N,,2025-11-20 10:01:21.035962

Ukraine is seeking $44 billion in compensation from Russia for war-related carbon emissions. Kyiv said the claim would cover emissions from the fossil fuels and emissions-heavy commodities like cement and steel used in fighting the war, as well as emissions from forest fires and from the deviation of commercial flights around closed Ukrainian airspace. In total, according to one independent analysis, those emissions add up to at least 237 million metric tons, more than the annual emissions of Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia combined.

It’s not clear whether Ukraine’s US and European allies will support the idea of taking this money out of frozen Russian assets, or whether another avenue exists by which Moscow could be compelled to pay. In the meantime, Oxford University researchers argue in a new paper that carbon markets could help Ukraine finance its post-war reconstruction, but only if the country’s emissions regulations are improved.

Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva arrived in Belém to rally COP30 delegates toward consensus, as the summit approaches its final days with no resolution on key issues. A call for countries to strengthen their national climate plans has met resistance from some developing countries, who, in a classic catch-22 of climate politics, say they can’t do more without more financial aid from wealthy countries, which are reluctant to commit more aid without stronger plans from recipients. Meanwhile, more than 80 countries have now come out in support of creating a detailed plan to transition the global economy away from fossil fuels.

But the plan still faces opposition from China and Gulf oil producers, among others. Delegates are also caught up in debate over gender identity, with the Vatican, Iran, and others pushing for a narrower definition in a draft Gender Action Plan, which aims to articulate ways in which countries can address the disproportionate impacts of climate change on women and girls. So far the only thing delegates have been able to agree on is where to host upcoming COPs: In Turkey next year, with Australia serving as the chief mediator, and then likely Ethiopia in 2027.

View / COP is ‘drowning in stupid homework’

Tim McDonnell

Climate and energy editor, Semafor

Juan Carlos Monterrey Gómez is on a mission at COP30 to save the trees — specifically the untold numbers that are sacrificed for the production of UN reports that no one reads.

Gómez, Panama’s climate envoy, usually spends COP meetings focused on finance and other common priorities. But this year, he told me, he is going into every meeting fixated on slashing paperwork. “People talk about drowning because of sea level rise, but no one is talking about bureaucrats drowning in stupid homework,” he said. Between COP and the multiple other environment-related UN conventions that Panama is a party to, he said, his office is responsible for producing up to 10 reports every year, some stretching to hundreds of pages. And as a remarkably self-aware UN report in August made clear, nearly all of these reports are ignored even by the officials they ostensibly exist to inform.

All this paperwork is more than just an annoyance, he said: For small countries especially, the workload is an unsustainable drain on time and money, and the fragmentation of information across so many channels makes it extremely complicated to make progress on any of the world’s climate goals. The only people who benefit from this system, he said, are the Western consulting firms cashing checks to help. Panama’s solution is to consolidate all of its environment-related plans and status updates into one Nature Pledge, to be published this week, which Gómez said he hopes can be a model for other overwhelmed countries to follow. So if you see Gómez in the hallway in Belém — look for his signature broad-brimmed hat — just don’t ask him to put anything in writing.

I’m back home now after a fun week in Brazil (I highly recommend beers at De Bubuia), but still following COP until it wraps up later this week. On the second day of the conference, Brazilian officials promised it would run no more than “five, maybe 10 minutes” over schedule. If the past is any indication, that’s likely over-optimistic. Most of the key issues up for debate remain unresolved, but as more high-level ministers land in Belém this week, things can start to move quickly.

The Trump administration is pushing through a new series of oil and gas deals, leaning again on US energy exports as a key lever in broader trade negotiations.

As Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman visits the White House this week, Saudi Aramco is expected to sign two deals to import US liquefied natural gas. Trump and MBS are also expected to discuss a possible deal to advance Saudi Arabia’s nuclear power program.

Meanwhile, the US also agreed to increase exports of liquefied petroleum gas to India, and to sell more LNG to Ukraine, which is facing a deep gas deficit following Russian attacks on its pipelines and gas wells.

While these deals offer a compelling route for Washington to strengthen its hold on global energy markets, they risk overselling what the US can actually provide: Fulfilling the US trade deal with the European Union this year would already require the US to redirect almost all of its existing fossil fuel exports there.

And it’s not clear that global demand for US LNG will really match the administration’s expectations: Goldman Sachs analysts warned in a note today that LNG prices will face a significant drop later this decade as supply overwhelms demand — but could perk back up in the 2030s, depending on how quickly China works to displace coal in its power sector.

Developed countries met their $100 billion climate finance target for developing nations in 2023, but some countries’ overperformance, combined with a focus on quantity rather than quality of funds mobilized, concealed others’ inefficiency, a new report found.

To pinpoint exactly where countries fell short on their commitments, the ODI think tank calculated each nation’s fair share based on historical responsibility for cumulative emissions, GDP, and population. The US, for example, paid less than half its fair share in 2023 despite bearing responsibility for the largest portion of climate finance. By contrast, Norway, France, Sweden, and Japan provided more than twice what they would be expected to deliver.

But even those figures need nuancing: France, while appearing generous in its contributions, stands out for its reliance on loans, while Japan, another generous contributor, allocated less than 15% of its climate finance to adaptation, focusing mostly on lower-emission projects rather than climate-resilient developments.

The Russian oil and gas company Lukoil was suspended from a coalition of oil majors working together to reduce their methane emissions after coming under heightened US sanctions.

The Oil and Gas Decarbonization Charter was launched at COP28 in Dubai, and includes 55 companies including all of the big US and European producers. That group is on track to cut its operational methane emissions nearly to zero by 2030, and to reach operational net zero for all emissions by 2050, Bjørn Otto Sverdrup, head of the charter’s secretariat, told Semafor. But for state-owned companies in emerging economies, as well as companies in sanctioned countries like Russia, Venezuela, and Iran, “many of them haven’t really started the journey” on methane, he said, leaving a major gap in the fossil fuel industry’s climate efforts. Lukoil was a rare exception, but “sanctions are making it difficult for companies to engage,” Sverdrup said. In the meantime, the US Treasury Department on Friday cleared the way for some potential buyers to negotiate with Lukoil on acquiring its overseas assets.

The World

at a Glance

US President Donald Trump reportedly approved covert CIA plans inside Venezuela that could pave the way for a broader military campaign in the country.

While the White House says its focus is on halting drug trafficking, experts believe its real aim is to oust Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who reportedly agreed to stand down after a delay of two or three years, an offer rejected by the White House.

Washington’s campaign, which includes the deployment of the world’s biggest aircraft carrier, has triggered a rally in defaulted Venezuelan bonds, reflecting investors’ enthusiasm for a country with enormous economic promise: According to Venezuelan opposition leader and Nobel peace laureate María Corina Machado, the economic benefits of a transition could be worth $2 trillion.

India is racing to stockpile Russian oil before US sanctions on Moscow’s biggest oil firms take effect tomorrow.

New Delhi has been buying Russian crude at steep discounts since the Kremlin’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, taking advantage of reduced demand thanks to EU restrictions, and Moscow’s desperation for foreign currency.

But the intake has caused friction between Delhi and Washington, and in August US President Donald Trump imposed punishing 50% tariffs on India. That did little to reduce India’s purchases, but a more recent approach, penalizing companies that bought from Russian oil majors, was more effective: India’s oil refiners are expected to fall in line, although a Carnegie Politika analysis noted that they could “resume purchases when Trump’s attention wanders.”

China is reportedly considering a new stimulus package for its struggling real estate sector, a mammoth industry that if weakened further could threaten the country’s financial stability.

Officials in Beijing are for the first time considering options such as mortgage subsidies and lowering home transaction costs to reverse the sector’s years-long slump.

While Chinese investors have gradually reduced their exposure to real estate, a huge share of the country’s wealth remains tied up in property that is fast losing value.

Despite Beijing’s intervention, “the real estate market downturn will continue for some time,” a former Chinese finance minister said, calling on authorities to keep fiscal policy loose to defend the world’s second-biggest economy from a property crash, Caixin reported.

Some US economic data was permanently lost during the government shutdown, an information shortfall that will make economic policymaking much harder.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics said the October jobs report would not be released independently, because surveys were halted: It is the first time in 77 years that the government will not publish an unemployment rate. Price data may also be lost.

The lack of information comes with the Federal Reserve divided over whether to cut rates in December, a crucial decision given rising consumer worries about inflation.

Last month, the Fed Chair Jerome Powell preached caution: “What do you do if you’re driving in a fog?” he said. “You slow down.”

The US and Saudi Arabia agreed to develop a rare earths refinery in the Gulf kingdom, the latest in a slew of investments announced after days of meetings between their leaders.

Under the deal, an American minerals firm will partner with Riyadh’s state-owned mining company to supply both countries’ manufacturing and defense industries, which currently rely heavily on rare earths from China, the industry’s dominant player.

While Western nations are racing to diversify their supply, experts have warned that production sites could take years to come online, with a senior official in Greenland — which the US has targeted for its vast deposits — saying it could be a decade before production starts.

The Trump administration is pressing Kyiv to accept a new plan that was drafted in consultation with Russia to end the Ukraine war.

Axios reported that the White House has been secretly working on the proposal with Russian officials, including Kirill Dmitriev, a close ally of Vladimir Putin, according to the Financial Times. The framework appears heavily tilted in Moscow’s favor, with one source telling the FT that accepting it would amount to Ukraine giving up its sovereignty; other potential concessions include rolling back US military assistance and adopting Russian as an official state language.

Washington is “trying to will into existence Russia’s maximalist demands,” a Russia-focused journalist argued, by “seizing on Russian battlefield gains and Ukraine’s corruption crisis.”

US chip giant Nvidia reported earnings that beat analysts’ expectations on Wednesday, likely reinvigorating the AI trade after several rocky days.

As fears of an AI bubble grow, investors and policymakers are increasingly hungry for clarity on the AI industry’s future; the health of the world’s most valuable company — Nvidia reported a 62% annual increase in quarterly revenue — is critical to that equation by showing bumper demand for its powerful AI chips.

The earnings come a day before September’s delayed US jobs report, another critical signal on the economy’s health that will provide clues into whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next month.

China is ramping up retaliation against Japan in a diplomatic row that is already impacting Tokyo’s fragile economy.

Beijing said Wednesday it was halting Japanese seafood imports and movie releases, after advising citizens against traveling to Japan. Relations between the two countries soured after Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s comments about Taiwan; Beijing is now punishing Tokyo with aggressive rhetoric and economic pain.

A blow to tourism is an “unwelcome drag” on Japan, a Moody’s analyst said, after the country reported its first quarterly GDP contraction in more than a year. But Japan’s public is “numb to Chinese rhetoric,” Bloomberg’s Japan-based columnist wrote, and Beijing’s conduct could help Takaichi advance her agenda by galvanizing public support.

The EU is scaling back its attack on Big Tech after years of aggressive regulation.

The bloc’s leadership laid out a “digital package of simplification” on Wednesday, which will streamline rules on AI and privacy — and potentially, dare we hope, remove those “cookies?” pop-up boxes that clutter up the screen before you click them away. The EU has grown concerned that overzealous regulation is stifling growth, The New York Times reported: The European Central Bank’s former President Mario Draghi warned in an influential report last year that without sweeping changes, the bloc could become an economic backwater.

The proposals have sparked backlash in Brussels, The Verge noted, with critics accusing lawmakers of “bowing to pressure from Big Tech.”

The price of bitcoin fell below $90,000 on Wednesday, marking a 27% plunge from its October high and erasing the digital token’s gains for the year.

Investors this week withdrew a record $523 million from BlackRock’s flagship bitcoin ETF, and the stock of pioneering digital asset firm Strategy tumbled further than bitcoin itself did over the same period, raising concerns of a “crypto winter.” The slide could imperil a slew of planned digital currency IPOs that aimed to capitalize on the higher valuations and favorable regulatory environment fostered by US President Donald Trump, The Information noted.

“Investors have never had more ways to place complex wagers on crypto,” The Wall Street Journal wrote, and “the dangers of those bets are becoming apparent.”

Gustav Klimt’s Portrait of Elisabeth Lederer became the world’s most valuable work of modern art at auction. Its $236.4 million price also made it the second most expensive artwork auctioned overall.

The portrait by the Austrian pioneer of symbolism and art nouveau was painted between 1914 and 1916, and depicted a young Jewish Viennese society woman; it was confiscated by the Nazis after the Austrian Anschluss. The record price is a rare bright spot for the high-end art market, which is struggling with lack of demand and few big-ticket lots, ARTnews reported.

Another stroke of luck for Sotheby’s: Frida Kahlo’s El sueño (La cama) is expected to set a new record Thursday for the most expensive artwork made by a woman.

A US judge ruled that Meta, the owner of Facebook, does not have an illegal monopoly, a decision that could pave the way for a new era of tech mergers and acquisitions.

The US Federal Trade Commission sued the company in 2020, saying its purchases of WhatsApp and Instagram in the early 2010s unfairly stifled competition. It was part of a wider crackdown on perceived antitrust violations under the Biden-era FTC, under which even small acquisitions were closely scrutinized.

The New York Times called the ruling a “sweeping victory” both for Meta and for Silicon Valley, which relies on big companies buying small ones to fuel innovation, but which has seen such deals cool under the more hawkish regulation.

A group of Africa experts said the upcoming G20 meeting in Johannesburg should focus on debt refinancing for low-income countries hit by soaring debt payments.

The panel said developing nations needed immediate debt relief, with interest payments ballooning in recent years amid rising inflation. While developing countries’ debt remains moderate compared to wealthier nations, their government revenues are far smaller and their interest rates far higher, meaning they spend a huge share of their national income servicing debt. Unless these burdens are eased, Africa will never exploit its potential, a former Ethiopian prime minister said.

This G20 “will long be remembered for its determination — or for its failure — to rise to the challenge,” Hailemariam Desalegn Boshe wrote.

Fitful US efforts to end the Ukraine war appeared to gain renewed momentum, though questions persisted over Russia’s willingness to countenance peace.

A top US envoy is set to meet Ukraine’s president in Turkey in a bid to revive stalled talks between Kyiv and Moscow, and Axios reported that the Trump administration has been secretly working with the Kremlin on a new peace plan.

American officials hope additional sanctions on Russia’s energy sector will bring the country to the table. But Russian President Vladimir Putin showed little interest in compromise during a meeting with China’s premier, and overnight strikes on Ukraine killed nine people, while Romania said it scrambled fighter jets over a purported Russian drone incursion.

The US inked a raft of deals with Saudi Arabia following talks between the countries’ leaders, deepening a partnership at the core of a revamped Middle East security order.

The agreements included the sale of F-35s, a civil nuclear deal, and cooperation on AI technology and critical minerals. Washington also designated Saudi Arabia a major non-NATO ally, while Riyadh pledged to invest $1 trillion in the US.

The visit was not without controversy: President Donald Trump contradicted his own intelligence agencies in saying the Saudi crown prince had no knowledge of the 2018 killing of a Saudi journalist, a murder that once threatened a rupture in bilateral ties. Instead, Congress has largely mimicked the president’s embrace of Saudi.

A successful push to expand uptake of the HPV vaccine will prevent an estimated 1.4 million deaths from cervical cancer, marking a major milestone for global health.

Around 86 million girls in high-risk countries were inoculated, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance announced, as part of a three-year campaign to ramp up access especially in low-income nations: Clinicians rode camels to vaccinate remote herding communities, and traveled by boat to villages that sit on riverbanks, Gavi’s HPV program head told the BBC’s Global News podcast.

But Gavi’s work is threatened by the $3 billion shortfall left by US aid cuts — a deficit that will necessitate “difficult decisions,” a spokesperson told CNN.

Anthropic’s valuation rose to $350 billion Tuesday, after Microsoft and Nvidia announced investments in the AI startup, the latest agreement tying together prominent American tech players.

Anthropic, which makes popular chatbot Claude, in turn made a $30 billion commitment to use Microsoft’s cloud services, as the tech giant tries to reduce reliance on OpenAI. Such eight-figure AI deals are becoming both increasingly common — “These announcements don’t hit like they used to huh,” Bloomberg’s Joe Weisenthal quipped — as well as circular: Companies are essentially funding their own customers, raising fears of a bubble.

A Goldman Sachs strategist questioned on a recent podcast whether this is “all ultimately a house of cards, with everyone propping each other up.”

China’s public is much more trusting of AI than the Western world, a new Edelman survey showed, a divide that could be critical in the fight for technological domination.

In China, 54% of people said they embrace greater AI use, compared to just 17% in the US; Chinese respondents were also more likely to believe AI can rectify climate change, mental health, and poverty. The enthusiasm reflects how the tech has become entrenched in Chinese life — starting from childhood — and could give Beijing an edge as it challenges the US’ lead.

Silicon Valley startups are increasingly running on lower-cost Chinese AI models, which “seemingly come out of nowhere to close the performance gap” with their US counterparts, a Bloomberg columnist wrote.

The US plans to sell advanced F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia, one of several deals expected to emerge from today’s talks between their leaders.

While US President Donald Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s Oval Office meeting may result in the defense sale — and potentially a civil nuclear deal — bigger issues are still in flux.

With the Middle East security order changing fast, Riyadh is pushing for a US security guarantee and is publicly pivoting away from Beijing in order to deepen ties with Washington. Separately, as Semafor’s Gulf Editor notes in an upcoming column, an obsolete narrative of bottomless Saudi oil wealth is butting up against the reality that Riyadh, like Washington, is courting foreign investment.

An outage at a major software company brought down large parts of the internet on Tuesday.

Cloudflare offers cybersecurity and internet infrastructure services, including encryption, defense against cyberattacks, and other services, for about a fifth of all websites. Its collapse — for an as-yet unknown reason — hit social media platform X and the AI chatbots Claude and ChatGPT, among dozens of other websites.

The problem again reveals the internet’s vulnerability to single points of failure: An outage at Amazon Web Services, the largest cloud provider, disrupted banks, airlines, and other platforms in October.

Microsoft and Alphabet’s respective cloud services also had significant recent collapses that caused widespread outages.

A few major companies are “the infrastructure of the internet,” an expert told The Guardian, “so when one of them fails it becomes really obvious.”

An intensifying selloff hit global markets yesterday, with stocks, crypto, and even gold dropping sharply.

The rout, partly fueled by investors’ worries of a US equities bubble, led to the Dow Jones Industrial Average’s worst three-day stretch in months, with tech stocks particularly hit: Nvidia, the world’s most valuable firm, lost almost $100 billion from its market capitalization.

Analysts have for months warned of an over-concentration of capital on the so-called “Magnificent Seven” tech firms, with some questioning whether the companies will be able to generate the extraordinary revenues needed to justify their soaring valuations.

Meanwhile abroad, experts warn of a deepening global exposure to American stock markets, with foreign investors owning a record share of US equities.

Google is making the latest bid at meeting rising consumer expectations for the capacity of a new AI model with the third version of Gemini released Tuesday.

Gemini 3 represents a significant boost in performance, beating OpenAI’s top models in several key industry benchmarks, as AI companies regularly leapfrog each other in performance. And it hints at what may become Google’s edge in the race between frontier models: its natively multimodal design.

Consumer expectations have been high, with some people speculating on the model’s performance or claiming to have been blown away by previews of its capability. The chatter prompted Andrej Karpathy, a former OpenAI researcher who once led AI for Tesla, to joke “I heard Gemini 3 answers questions before you ask them. And that it can talk to your cat.”

Excitement about a new model release can be positive, but it can also lead to a letdown if consumers expect too much. Some users believed OpenAI’s GPT-5, released in August, would be a major breakthrough and were disappointed when the improvement turned out to be incremental.

The nature of large foundation models like Gemini is that it’s difficult to predict what new capabilities will emerge with a massive new training run, or what attributes might change, irking passionate users who have grown accustomed to them.

“We invest in a lot of testing, both internally and externally,” said Koray Kavukcuoglu, Google’s chief AI architect and CTO of DeepMind, in an interview with Semafor. “But at the end of the day, there’s nothing that can replace hundreds of millions of users testing something in many different ways, and that creativity.”

In this article:

Putting products into the world at such a rapid pace is part of Google’s push to get back to its roots and rise to the challenge of a disruptive new technology wave — one that it helped usher in with AI breakthroughs over the past decade.

In April, DeepMind co-founder and CEO Demis Hassabis put Josh Woodward in charge of the Gemini app to help boost its feature set to appeal to a wider array of consumers. Woodward’s Google Labs, a division he still leads, had built NotebookLM, an experiment that became one of the company’s most popular AI apps.

Google said Tuesday that the app now has 650 million monthly users, putting it closer but still behind ChatGPT’s reported 800 million weekly active users.

Gemini 3 comes with a new batch of products including a developer tool that removes the need for writing code, an agent that can sort your emails, and a vibe coding tool for turning simple prompts into elaborate, interactive graphics.

“That’s all coming from how close we are working together and how synchronized we are that by the time the model development is done, we are actually ready to release something together,” Kavukcuoglu said.

“I’ve been describing the new role as fast and full on,” Woodward said. “There’s a lot of brainstorming, a lot of thinking about where we want to go, what we’re seeing from feedback, but also what are just new model capabilities we can build features around.”

When Google was racing to build what would eventually become Gemini following the surprising success of ChatGPT, it chose to build it as a “natively multimodal” foundation model, incorporating not just text but images, videos, and other multimedia in the training data.

In the long run, DeepMind hopes the approach will lead toward advanced general intelligence and robotics, but it has also borne fruit in the short term, putting the company ahead in areas like image and video creation.

In the latest update, Woodward said the multimodality has shown signs of a kind of cross-pollination, where two modalities improve the capabilities of one another. An example in Gemini 3 is “multimodal vibe coding,” where users can visually instruct the model to make changes in coding. Google product managers, he said, can take screenshots of an application, upload it to the model, and code up new features and bug fixes to show the development team on the spot.

While that was possible in Gemini 2.5, it’s gotten better in the latest version as a result of the two modalities improving in tandem. “They’re not only better individually, but they’re better together,” Woodward said.

Another example is Generative Interfaces, a new feature Google unveiled Tuesday. A user might ask for a visual aid to help learn about a complex subject, like cellular biology. Rather than spit out text or still images, Gemini 3 is capable of coding an app in the background and then presenting it as an interactive experience with animations. “You can imagine that permeating a lot of different tools over time,” Woodward said.

Gemini 3 is an impressive model, judging by the benchmarks, but that’s not surprising. The DeepMind team, combined with Google’s infrastructure, will keep Google at the forefront, if not in the lead, in raw capability. But most of Google’s billions of users probably aren’t aware the benchmarks exist. They notice the products.

Google’s biggest challenge — the one it’s been tackling now for a few years — is turning AI capability into products as transformative and essential as YouTube, Google Maps, Gmail, and, of course, search itself.

The Gemini 3 launch seems to show the breadth of possibilities. The product announcements span enterprise and consumer, productivity and entertainment. It’s a reminder that Google is gargantuan. That is one of its weaknesses. Size moves slowly. But if the company can execute on AI product development across its vast empire, size can also be an advantage.

Generative interfaces, for instance, may be what “search” looks like in the future. While OpenAI and Perplexity have changed search from a bunch of blue links to a coherent answer, that probably isn’t where this ends. Most people are visual learners, so it makes sense they would prefer an interactive, visual app instead of a paragraph of text.

Right now, there isn’t enough compute power to offer this kind of response for free to billions of users. But that part is what Google is really good at — finding ways to build infrastructure as efficiently as possible — or in space, if needed.

Google has a daunting challenge ahead, one that requires a lot of building in every corner of the empire. You can tell that the employees who have remained at the company are having a little bit more fun, even if they’re working more hours.

With each product launch, you catch a glimpse of the progress.

Reuters reported recently that DeepMind’s Hassabis has been focused on the company’s scientific endeavors at the expense of its business.

Some investors question why Alphabet hasn’t emerged as the undisputed AI leader given its inherent strengths. “It’s the classic team with all the talent that doesn’t win the national championship,” said Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management. The Minneapolis investment firm this year sold around $14 million of Alphabet stock, concerned about its prospects, despite recent strides, in the fast-changing AI marketplace, Munster said.

Google has quite a bit of catching up to do with other AI companies, especially OpenAI, but the search giant’s bets on cloud, chips, and research may be starting to pay off, Business Insider argues. “If Gemini 3 is a smash hit, Google just has to not fumble it. No pressure,” tech correspondent Hugh Langley writes.

China’s civil aircraft manufacturer COMAC took a crucial first step towards challenging Western planemaking giants Boeing and Airbus.

The company flew its C919 airliner at the Dubai Airshow, in its first unveiling outside of Asia. The narrow-body plane entered service in China in 2023, a rival to the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737, the workhorses of commercial aviation. So far, though, it has had no major customers outside China and lacks certification by major Western regulators.

Boeing, though, is struggling after some high-profile disasters, and China’s ties to Gulf countries means there is a market opportunity for COMAC. Analysts told Reuters that China would struggle to gain significant market share, but that COMAC’s presence in Dubai was a signal of its ambition.

US President Donald Trump threatened to expand his military campaign to countries across Latin America, rattling local markets and upending geopolitics in the region.

The Trump administration has carried out strikes on vessels off the coast of Venezuela alleged to be ferrying drugs, and the president said yesterday he would be “proud” to extend attacks to include land targets in Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela.

The threats mark a sharp shift in Washington’s foreign policy, suggesting it wants to make the Western Hemisphere — where Chinese presence has surged this century — its central focus, The New York Times’ Mexico bureau chief said. The “Donroe Doctrine… promises major benefits,” including access to natural resources and “strategic security positions,” Jack Nicas wrote.

Poland said an explosion along a railway line used to ferry supplies to Ukraine was an act of “sabotage,” implying that Russia was behind the blast.

The incident, which did not result in casualties, was the latest in a series of episodes across Europe for which authorities have suggested Moscow was responsible. Analysts say the Kremlin uses so-called hybrid warfare to sow discord, test European defences, and blur the line between war and peace. Russia has denied responsibility for the various unexplained drone sightings, explosions, and killings.

Even as they increase traditional defense spending to deter Moscow, however, Europeans “must also acknowledge that hybrid hostilities with the Kremlin are already underway,” an expert wrote for the Atlantic Council.

Gunmen abducted 25 girls from a boarding school in northern Nigeria, the latest sign of the country’s persistent security struggles. The region — which borders the Sahel, the world’s terrorism hotspot — has for years been overrun by Islamist militias including Boko Haram, which in 2014 kidnapped 270 girls in northern Nigeria. Successive governments have vowed to crack down on the armed groups, though progress has been limited.

The US, which has accused Abuja of doing little to stop the killing of Christians in the country, has pushed for greater cooperation; Nigeria’s foreign minister confirmed recent security talks between the countries, AFP reported.

India agreed to source nearly 10% of its liquefied petroleum gas from the US, as New Delhi works to finalize its long-awaited trade deal with Washington.

Monday’s agreement, which an Indian minister called a “historic first,” will bolster India’s energy security and also mollify the US, The Times of India wrote, after Washington slapped New Delhi with punishing tariffs over its trade surplus and purchases of Russian crude.

The deal also helps India diversify its supply of LPG, a key cooking fuel, away from Gulf countries like the UAE and Saudi Arabia, even as New Delhi increases its Middle East crude oil imports following sanctions on Russia. It reflects “the delicate balance India is trying to achieve,” Bloomberg reported.

Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler kicks off a diplomatic offensive in Washington this week, seeking to cement a deepening alliance with a raft of proposed deals.

Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is pursuing a defense guarantee, a nuclear agreement, and greater access to cutting-edge chips to fuel the kingdom’s economic diversification and AI ambitions. Once a pariah over the murder of a Saudi journalist, MBS now enjoys strong relations with the US, won over by Saudi’s social transformation, economic potential, and stores of energy needed to power data centers.

But despite closer ties, MBS must still ensure that “all the goodwill he has built up in the Trump era continues into future administrations,” Semafor’s Saudi bureau chief noted.

Japanese tourism and retail stocks fell Monday as the country’s diplomatic spat with China weighed on investors.

Nearly 500,000 Japan-bound plane tickets on Chinese airlines were canceled after Beijing told citizens to avoid traveling there, the South China Morning Post reported. The row stemmed from the new Japanese premier’s comments about Taiwan; Tokyo dispatched a senior official to China on Monday in a bid to ease tensions. This isn’t a “crisis moment,” FXStreet wrote, but rather a “meaningful reset in Asia’s geopolitical risk premium.”

Beijing — which is known to test new, Taiwan-sympathetic leaders — sees a global diplomatic tilt in favor of Taipei and wants to signal that “rhetorical shifts around Taiwan… will be met with economic consequences.”

Jeff Bezos is launching an AI startup that he will spearhead as co-CEO, The New York Times reported.

Called Project Prometheus, the company has secured more than $6 billion in funding and plans to focus on tech that “dovetails with Mr. Bezos’ interest in taking people to outer space,” The Times wrote, with AI assisting in engineering and manufacturing across computers and aerospace. The move marks a return to the C-suite for Bezos, who has not held a formal operational role since stepping down as Amazon CEO in 2021.

Bezos is jumping into a crowded field, where a growing number of buzzy startups are raising billions to research ways to accelerate AI applications in the physical sciences.

A Bangladeshi court sentenced former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to death over her government’s deadly crackdown on a student-led uprising that ousted her last year.

Hasina, convicted of crimes against humanity, has been in self-exile in India since fleeing Bangladesh more than 14 months ago; Dhaka has called on New Delhi to extradite her, though given her close ties to India, it’s unlikely to do so. The sentence seals Hasina’s downfall — even though she still leads the former ruling party — and could “reshape the country’s political future” ahead of elections scheduled for February, a Bangladeshi journalist wrote.

If the next government aggressively pushes for Hasina’s extradition, it could put more pressure on India and its relationship with Dhaka.","https://img.semafor.com/18e29b3241e38ca12dcb66b63b2ad9f980578df2-5500x3667.jpg?rect=0,390,5500,2888&w=1200&h=630&q=75&auto=format",N,,2025-11-20 08:59:07.082564

Both areas involve materials, including solvents, corrosives, VOC sources, or end-of-life electronics, that require clear documentation and traceability to maintain environmental compliance.
But the broader pattern remains: Environmental compliance challenges are emerging across multiple segments of the electronics chain, from downstream exports to upstream prototyping labs.","A recent investigation by the Basel Action Network has renewed questions about environmental accountability throughout the electronics lifecycle.

In October, BAN identified several US-based ITAD companies sending used electronics to countries where import rules restrict or prohibit such material under Basel Convention-aligned regulations.

The United States is not a Basel party, and US law does not explicitly ban all outbound shipments of used electronics. But such exports can violate the receiving countries’ rules, and the findings reinforced concerns about screening processes, downstream vetting and the reliability of voluntary certifications across the sector.

Those issues were widely viewed as challenges concentrated among small or mid-sized operators. A new federal enforcement action announced this week suggests otherwise. The US Environmental Protection Agency’s settlement with Apple over hazardous waste violations at a facility in Santa Clara adds a separate, but related, reminder that gaps in environmental management appear at multiple levels of the electronics value chain. Even some of the best-resourced firms are experiencing basic compliance failures in areas regulators consider foundational.

The EPA’s settlement, published Nov. 18, concludes a two-year review of a facility Apple uses for semiconductor-related research and development. The agency cited deficiencies in waste characterization, emissions controls for solvent systems, container management, land-disposal notifications and routine inspection practices.

Apple has since corrected the issues and agreed to pay a $261,283 penalty. According to the agency, the site is now operating in compliance with the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the federal framework governing hazardous waste.

These findings were not new to observers who followed the case during its earlier stages. Inspection records released in 2024, including documents referenced by the individual who filed the initial complaint, outlined the specific handling and characterization issues that drew EPA attention in the first place.

Regulators identified at least 19 potential violations during inspections conducted in August 2023 and January 2024. The issues documented in those reports included solvent tanks managed under state-only classifications despite meeting federal criteria for ignitable waste, incomplete testing of carbon filters used to trap VOC emissions, and several corrosive or solvent waste containers lacking full analysis or required labeling.

Inspectors also found gaps in monitoring routines. Daily inspection logs were incomplete, particularly on weekends when the building operated without personnel on site. Calibration records for emissions-monitoring equipment were missing in several instances, and some waste shipments may not have included documentation demonstrating proper federal characterization. While the EPA press release summarized only the principal violations, the more detailed inspection documents provided the operational description behind the ultimate settlement.

The BAN investigation and the Apple case expose how inconsistent environmental enforcement has become. The two situations differ in scale and context, but they highlight similar structural weaknesses in the form of incomplete downstream controls in the ITAD sector, and uneven operational discipline within R&D environments at major electronics manufacturers. Both areas involve materials, including solvents, corrosives, VOC sources, or end-of-life electronics, that require clear documentation and traceability to maintain environmental compliance.

The Apple situation also illustrates the particular challenges associated with semiconductor research sites. These facilities handle smaller volumes of hazardous materials than large fabrication plants, but the chemical profiles and regulatory expectations are similar. As AI- and ML-driven hardware development accelerates, demand for specialized solvents and process chemicals has increased. Regulators have responded by paying closer attention to emissions routing, waste determinations, and storage timelines, especially in regions like Santa Clara where semiconductor-related activity is dense.

The convergence of these developments carries practical implications for ITAD operators. The BAN findings showed that not all downstream partners are operating within the rules of importing countries or international norms. The Apple settlement showed that even large companies face scrutiny over waste handling fundamentals.

Both outcomes suggest that environmental assurances, whether in an OEM’s sustainability pledge or an ITAD firm’s certification claims, require verification and internal systems strong enough to withstand inspection.

What is certain is that in the broader market, repeated compliance concerns can influence enterprise procurement and ESG assessments. Investors and customers increasingly weigh environmental performance when evaluating supply-chain partners.

Although the financial penalty in Apple’s case is small relative to the company’s scale, the enforcement action signals the continued regulatory attention aimed at hazardous waste handling in the electronics ecosystem.

With the Santa Clara investigation now closed, the EPA has affirmed that Apple has resolved the identified issues. But the broader pattern remains: Environmental compliance challenges are emerging across multiple segments of the electronics chain, from downstream exports to upstream prototyping labs.

As scrutiny intensifies and expectations around traceability expand, operators at all levels, from recyclers and major OEMs to enterprises that use the technology, may face more sustained pressure to tighten oversight and improve documentation.

The Clean Air Act argument, if it sticks, sets the stage to potentially undo emissions standards for oil and gas operations and other polluting facilities. This normally requires a series of “individual rule-making” steps, but EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has signaled that he may invoke the ""good cause"" exception under an administrative act to bypass those steps. Some petro stakeholders worry that dismantling the federal law could actually work against them because it could give states more regulatory leeway.

Pat Parenteau, a professor and senior fellow for Climate Policy, Vermont Law and Graduate School, explains: “Today, [oil and gas] companies' main argument against liability is that the Clean Air Act preempts state law. If the Supreme Court reverses its holding and rules that the Act does not authorize regulation of GHG, the preemption argument falls away.

“Companies would be liable in more than 30 lawsuits that states and municipalities have filed [to date] and could be on the hook for billions of dollars in damages from climate change,” he says.

The other focus of this rule-making, the endangerment finding, is the legal foundation for climate policies. It concludes that certain greenhouse gases “threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations.”

It was the EPA that established the finding back in 2009 based on a robust collection of decades of research. More recent studies further back the endangerment finding, “with zero countervailing evidence,” write a group of researchers who say their climate predictions have all come true, “some alarmingly faster than anticipated.”

“The scientific consensus that runaway greenhouse gas emissions are hazardous to human health and well-being is so total, thorough, and overwhelming that it has withstood decades of well-funded attempts to disprove it,” says Jon Goldstein, associate vice president, Energy Transition, Environmental Defense Fund.

But Trump’s EPA stands firm that the agency “unreasonably analyzed the scientific record” and also claims that “no requisite technology for vehicle and engine emission control can address global climate change concerns without risking greater harms to public health and welfare.”

EPA bases its position largely on a new Department of Energy report that downplays the impact of climate change. Though it reportedly contains a plethora of inaccuracies, with several scientists stating that its content misrepresents their conclusions. In line with the push for these regulatory rollbacks, the Trump administration has proposed eliminating the Greenhouse Gas Reporting program that requires coal-fired power plants, industrial factories, and oil refining facilities to disclose their emissions to the federal government. The EPA is also targeting dozens of other air and or water quality protections, loosening and or eliminating standards for fossil energy sectors.

The agency argues that these regulations come with too high a cost to industries, which ultimately gets passed down to taxpayers. Though previous administrations point to the “social costs” of carbon, or the economic damages (such as harm to human health and declining crop yields). EPA concluded in 2023 that one metric ton of carbon dioxide cost $190 in 2020; and projected it would cost about $230 in 2030; and about $308 in 2050.

In the absence of strong, constant federal policy over time, states are increasingly setting their own rules. Twenty-four states and the District of Columbia have adopted greenhouse gas reduction targets to address climate change, with Colorado’s among the most rigorous. The state passed the first methane rules for the oil and gas sector in 2014 and, in 2024, became the first to create a comprehensive framework for methane measurement, reporting, and verification at oil and gas production sites.

Notably, Colorado’s regulations have come from a collaborative stakeholder-driven process that has earned the support of the state’s oil and gas trade associations, Goldstein says. New Mexico is also among the most aggressive in its clampdown on oil and gas releases, and emissions have been dropping since. Satellite readings of a part of the Permian Basin show that the methane intensity on New Mexico’s side of the basin was less than half of that on neighboring Texas’s loosely regulated side.

Other states and regions join Colorado and New Mexico with varied policies targeting greenhouse gas emissions, or policies to develop clean energy resources or promote alternative fuel vehicles, among other measures. Though the Trump administration is attempting to block states from leading in transitioning to clean energy, having revoked vehicle emissions standards set by California and by over a dozen other states, actions that have prompted lawsuits.

Some of the private sector is continuing to prioritize climate actions too, despite a radically changing federal policy landscape. Ninety-one percent of businesses surveyed by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development either maintained or increased their investments in clean energy in 2025. They are investing in climate-proofing their value chains. They have committed to setting science-based targets for emissions reductions. And are buying carbon credits.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt4a147f9e36f0754a/bltcac270dea623eab8/691e52de78e5efa9d3bb2cdc/US_EPA_HQ_1540.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-11-20 11:05:05.200145

Schneider signs two deals with US data centre operators

New agreements expected to generate nearly $2.3 billion in sales

Company says its solution can scale AI capacity without raising power demand

Nov 19 (Reuters) – Schneider Electric (SCHN.PA) said on Wednesday that it had signed new deals worth almost $2.3 billion with two U.S. data centre operators, as surging adoption of artificial intelligence boosts infrastructure demand.

At an industry event in Las Vegas, the French industrial group announced a $1.9 billion partnership with privately held tech firm Switch, covering power modules and cooling systems.

The second agreement, valued at $373 million and involving uninterruptible power supplies and switchgear, was signed with Texas-based Digital Realty (DLR.N).

The two contracts are a phased delivery of 2025 and 2026, a Schneider spokesperson said.

Schneider, France’s biggest energy company by market value, has emerged as a key data centre supplier, making server racks, cooling and power equipment that form the backbone of AI infrastructure.

It is also working with chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA.O) to design cooling systems for its most powerful AI chips.

Large-scale cloud service providers, also known as hyperscalers, are racing to build AI infrastructure. Amazon, Meta, Google and Microsoft are projected to spend more than $360 billion in 2025, according to company filings.

AI RAMPS UP PRESSURE ON US ENERGY GRID

The deal with Switch is Schneider’s largest cooling services agreement for data centres in North America to date. Schneider said the solution it is supplying should help scale AI capacity without proportionally increasing energy demand.

“Current data centre infrastructure wasn’t built to meet the demands of AI,” said Vandana Singh, senior vice president at Schneider’s North American secure power division.

U.S. utilities are struggling to keep pace with Big Tech’s power-hungry AI data centres.

Analysts from Morgan Stanley have estimated that global power demand from data centres will nearly triple in the next three years, intensifying the strain on already stretched U.S. power grids.

The data centre business accounts for nearly a quarter of Schneider’s total revenue. Financial analysts are expecting it to unveil targets tied to AI development during its capital markets day in London on December 11.

Local benefits already being delivered by the Lewis Hub include:

Multi-million-pound funding to unlock the development of nearly 100 new homes near Stornoway, which will initially house construction workers but will pass to the local community and provide a substantial boost for affordable home provision in Lewis.

£3.4 million to upgrade a road leading to Arnish Point near Stornoway, improving access to Stornoway Port and supporting local economic development.

Significant funding to expand Macaulay College, providing new facilities to help students reach their potential.

With consent now granted, construction of the Lewis Hub is expected to begin early in 2026.

Alison Hall, Director of Development for SSEN Transmission, commented: “We are delighted with today’s decision, which will play a major role in supporting Scotland and the UK’s clean energy ambitions, and help fulfil a decades-long ambition to connect the Western Isles to the GB transmission network. Investing in this local electricity transmission network connection is also a major driver of jobs and economic activity, and we are already seeing the positive impact the Lewis Hub is delivering through new housing and infrastructure upgrades supporting economic and social growth for the islands.”

Hall continued: “With the creation of new jobs within SSEN Transmission and our supply chain partners, as well as proposals for community benefit funding and our housing legacy commitments, our projects will deliver a lasting legacy in communities across the north of Scotland including in the Western Isles. This decision marks a key milestone in delivering UK and Scottish Government energy targets – creating a hub for clean energy projects that will help build a cleaner, more secure and affordable electricity system for generations to come.”

Colin Bell, Lead Development Project Manager for SSEN Transmission, noted: “This decision is the culmination of a detailed development process where we have sought to achieve the best balance from a community, environmental, and technical perspective, listening closely to the views of the local community with whom we have consulted extensively. We will continue to engage constructively with the local community throughout the lifetime of this project, as we fulfil our commitment to being a good neighbour and delivering a positive legacy.”

The Lewis Hub is a key part of SSEN Transmission’s plans to invest at least £22 billion in the period until March 2031, potentially rising to £31.7 billion. This represents one of the largest private investment programmes in Scotland and will act as a major driver of jobs and economic growth across the country.

Independent economic analysis, peer-reviewed by leading consultancy, BiGGAR Economics, forecasts that if fully delivered, the £31.7 billion investment could support up to 17 500 jobs in Scotland, including 8400 in the north of Scotland, and add up to £7 billion to the Scottish economy, with £3 billion in the north of Scotland alone.

Reflecting the significant expansion of the transmission network across the north of Scotland, SSEN Transmission continues to grow its workforce. Employee numbers have increased from around 400 in 2019 to over 2500 today, with plans to recruit around 600 new roles in 2025/26.

Following the UK Government’s Community Benefit Guidance for new electricity transmission infrastructure, over £100 millions of community benefit funding is expected across the north of Scotland.

SSEN Transmission’s Pathway to 2030 programme is also expected to support the development of at least 1000 new homes across the north of Scotland, creating a lasting legacy by meeting local housing needs once projects are complete. The recent announcement of an agreement enabling the construction of close to 100 new homes near Stornoway was among the first deals to be reached by SSEN Transmission as part of its housing strategy ambitions.

Both Nickolai and Sheep Creek have been added as transparency projects at this stage.","Alaska Energy Metals' Nickolai nickel and US Critical Materials' Sheep Creek gallium-rare earths projects added to FAST-41 dashboard.

As part of the Trump administration's push to bolster domestic supplies of minerals critical to American automotive, defense, energy, and high-tech manufacturing, the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council (Permitting Council) has added the Nickolai in Alaska and Sheep Creek in Montana as transparency projects on the Federal Permitting Dashboard.

""I am excited to welcome the Nikolai Nickel and Sheep Creek projects to the FAST-41 program,"" said Permitting Council Executive Director Emily Domenech. ""We are proud to support more mining projects that will strengthen the U.S. economy and reduce our reliance on foreign nations.""

Established in 2015 by Title 41 of the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (FAST-41), the Permitting Council is a federal agency charged with improving the transparency and predictability of permitting critical infrastructure projects – including mines, natural gas pipelines, renewable energy, electricity transmission, telecommunications, and certain emerging technologies.

Under the Trump administration, the Permitting Council has steadily added to the list of mining projects eligible for the streamlined permitting and transparency offered by the FAST-41 program.

Graphite Creek and Donlin Gold are among the high-profile projects in Alaska that have been added to the FAST-41 program. The Stillwater palladium-platinum mine is a top Montana project accepted into the program.

FAST-41 projects fall into two categories:

• Covered projects, which receive coordinated interagency permitting and defined timelines, and a public dashboard that offers transparency and accountability.

• Transparency projects, typically smaller or earlier-staged projects, which benefit from public-facing permitting dashboards but do not receive full coordination.

Both Nickolai and Sheep Creek have been added as transparency projects at this stage.

""I look forward to working with the project sponsors to provide a transparent and predictable federal permitting process while achieving President Trump's vision for American energy dominance,"" said Domenech.

Enormous Alaska nickel project

Lying on the southern flanks of the Alaska Range, approximately 130 miles southeast of Fairbanks, Alaska Energy Metals' Nikolai project hosts one of the largest known nickel-cobalt-platinum group metal (PGM)-chromium deposits in North America.

Based on drilling completed by Alaska Energy Metals and previous exploration companies, the Eureka deposit at Nikolai hosts:

• 1.19 billion metric tons of indicated resource averaging 0.21% (5.61 billion pounds) nickel.

• 2.09 billion metric tons of inferred resource averaging 0.2% (9.38 billion lb) nickel.

• Large quantities of copper, cobalt, PGMs, chromium, and iron byproducts are found in both resource categories.

The chromium, cobalt, copper, nickel, palladium, and platinum found in this world-class-sized deposit are all on the 2025 list of minerals critical to U.S. economic development, energy, and national security.

""With Nikolai hosting six critical minerals, two of which, nickel and cobalt, are Defense Production Act Title III materials deemed to be in shortfall, we are extremely well aligned with the U.S. national security objective of developing long-lived, domestic sources of metals and minerals essential to the national economy and national defense,"" said Alaska Energy Metals CEO Gregory Beischer.

In addition to advancing Nickolai towards mine design, permitting, and development, Alaska Energy Metals has partnered with RecycLiCo Battery Materials to study the potential of leveraging RecycLiCo's proprietary hydrometallurgical process to refine critical mineral concentrates produced at Nikolai.

""AEMC would like to produce refined metal products from our Nikolai deposit on-site rather than having to ship metal concentrate to Asian smelters for refining – particularly at a time when the United States is heavily reliant on countries officially designated Foreign Entities of Concern to meet U.S. demand for nickel and other critical minerals,"" said Beischer.

With Nikolai added as a FAST-41 transparency project, federal agencies, investors, and the public at large will be able to track permitting activities as Alaska Energy Metals advances its plans to develop a multi-critical-mineral mine and refining complex in Alaska.

Extraordinary Sheep Creek

While in an even earlier stage of exploration and development, US Critical Materials' Sheep Creek project in southwestern Montana is extraordinary in both the quantities and grades of several high-priority critical minerals found there.

Sheep Creek is best known for hosting high-grade gallium and rare earths, and also hosts significant quantities of niobium – a metal essential to advanced steel alloys and classified as critical to the U.S.

High-grade critical mineral values at Sheep Creek were confirmed by Idaho National Laboratories in 2024. Highlights from nine rock samples collected over a two-mile-long mineralized corridor at Sheep Creek include:

• 13.45% total rare earth elements (TREE) and 250 parts per million gallium.

• 13.82% TREE and 300 ppm gallium.

• 17.78% TREE and 350 ppm gallium.

On average, the samples returned 9.9% TREE, including 2.4% neodymium and praseodymium – the key rare earths used in high-power magnets for EV motors, defense systems, and other high-tech devices.

The gallium found at Sheep Creek is a high-priority metal for the U.S.

""Gallium is not just a mineral – it's a strategic asset,"" said GreenMet CEO Drew Horn, a defense supply chain strategist who previously served as a senior official at the White House National Security Council, Department of Energy, and Department of Defense.

Four interrelated factors make gallium a strategic asset to the U.S.:

• It is extremely rare and seldom found in concentrations high enough to support a standalone mine.

• It is the primary ingredient in wide-bandgap semiconductors used in smartphones, computers, telecommunication networks, LEDs, solar cells, and medical devices.

• The U.S. is 100% reliant on imports for its supply of this high-tech metal.

• China, which produces roughly 98% of the global supply, banned exports of gallium to the U.S. in 2024.

Sheep Creek is one of the only places in the world that shows potential to support a standalone gallium mine that would also produce significant rare earth and niobium co-products.

Sheep Creek's addition as a FAST-41 transparency project signals increased federal attention as US Critical Materials gains a better understanding of the quantities of critical minerals found there and looks at future-leaning technologies to extract them efficiently and sustainably.

""We look forward to partnering with the Permitting Council and the Forest Service to advance Sheep Creek exploration and support the national priority to reestablish U.S. mineral sovereignty,"" said Eric Levy-Myers, director of strategy and innovation at US Critical Materials. ""We are particularly committed to implement next-generation, environmentally responsible Mine of the Future techniques.""

(Reuters) -Operators of the U.S. electric grid covering the world's largest data center market on Wednesday said they planned to move forward with a plan to manage the connection of the giant server warehouses that are propelling the country's power use to record highs and raising the risk of supply shortfalls.

PJM Interconnection, the biggest grid operator in North America, spanning 13 states and Washington, D.C., has been struggling to keep up with booming demand from the proliferation of Big Tech's power-hungry data centers needed for the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence.

PJM members, which include power generators, utilities and large energy users, cast votes on Wednesday that rejected about a dozen proposals aimed at quickly linking up data centers to the PJM grid while attempting to reduce the reliability risks of doing so. Following the results, representatives of the PJM Board of Managers said they still intended to advance a plan to handle its surging data center interconnection requests and aimed to finalize it by December.

Earlier proposals for the so-called ""Critical Issue Fast Path"" required data center developers to bring their own power supplies and shut off operations during energy emergencies, including when electricity use surges on very hot and cold days. Those provisions were removed from later versions of the plan, and it was unclear what a final roadmap for PJM's handling of data centers would be.

Data centers are expected to account for nearly all of the 32 gigwatts of demand growth PJM forecasts on its system through 2030. Without significantly increasing power supplies, PJM has warned of power shortages in the region as early as 2027.

PJM covers Northern Virginia, which has the biggest global concentration of data centers. Other burgeoning hubs are developing in states, including Ohio, Indiana and Pennsylvania, elsewhere in the Mid-Atlantic grid.

The power crunch has sent prices in PJM's annual capacity auction rising by more than 1,000% over the last two auctions.

The region's power bills started rising last summer. High prices in the auction are meant to encourage the build out of additional power plants and bring equilibrium to the market, but costs and supply chain problems have contributed to lengthy delays with building new power plants.

“About eight out of 10 Michiganders support clean energy investments, but the Trump administration is out of step with what our state wants and what Michiganders need.” As a result, Detroiters and Michiganders are seeing stalled progress and backward momentum on clean energy jobs, Chang said.
“So today, we are calling on the Trump administration to end the attacks on climate policy and clean energy investments.
Michiganders and Americans deserve clean air and good clean energy jobs, and the federal government should do its part.” Jamie Racklyeft, the executive director of the Michigan Electric Vehicle Alliance, argued against treating investments in clean energy as a partisan issue.
As members of the Legislature weigh what the future of the state’s tax incentives will look like for businesses, Chang said she was hopeful supporting clean energy jobs could be a part of that conversation.","Following an Australian clean energy company’s decision in September to cancel plans for a battery plant in Detroit, state Sen. Stephanie Chang (D-Detroit) joined leaders from the Michigan Electric Vehicle Alliance and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 58 to break down how the project could have helped the community.

Fortescue, a green technology and metals company, announced in 2024 that it would redevelop a vacant industrial building near the historic Ford Piquette Plant into a $210 million electric vehicle battery factory which was expected to create 600 jobs. However, that plan soured, with the company telling Crain’s Detroit Business that the “current policy settings and market conditions” including President Donald Trump’s Administration’s decision to eliminate “critical tax credits” for electric vehicles and clean energy were the driving force behind the decision to scrap the project.

Chang, who has served in the Legislature since 2015, noted that she has represented communities throughout Detroit who are facing environmental justice concerns, including disproportionate impacts from air pollution.

She noted that the Asthma and Allergy Foundation had ranked Detroit as the most challenging city in the nation for people with asthma based on the prevalence of asthma, and the higher than average number of asthma deaths, with vehicle exhaust and industrial emissions serving as major risk factors for individuals with respiratory conditions.

The Fortescue plant would have been an amazing example of revitalization for the city, Chang said, with construction crews already working on remediation and electrical upgrades. However, the Trump Administration’s move to cut support for clean energy and transportation put a stop to that, Chang said.

“And this is after $12.7 million in state incentives and $11 million in Detroit incentives that were offered and thankfully were not paid out due to the cancelation,” Chang said. “About eight out of 10 Michiganders support clean energy investments, but the Trump administration is out of step with what our state wants and what Michiganders need.”

As a result, Detroiters and Michiganders are seeing stalled progress and backward momentum on clean energy jobs, Chang said.

The potential health benefits that could have come alongside the adoption of more EVs and clean energy sources will also go unrealized, Chang said,

“Detroiters with asthma are going to continue to suffer. Clean air would have led to better health and more worker productivity, but we are going to be losing out on this opportunity.” Chang said. “So today, we are calling on the Trump administration to end the attacks on climate policy and clean energy investments. Michiganders and Americans deserve clean air and good clean energy jobs, and the federal government should do its part.”

Jamie Racklyeft, the executive director of the Michigan Electric Vehicle Alliance, argued against treating investments in clean energy as a partisan issue.

“Michigan now has well over 120,000 people working in clean energy and clean transportation jobs, with the sector growing faster than the overall economy and ranking among the strongest in the nation,” Racklyeft said. “Every lost project means fewer paychecks, slower neighborhood revitalization and more tailpipe and smokestack pollution in places that have already carried that burden for generations.”

Meanwhile, China continues to dominate the EV market, while the U.S. only makes up a small margin of EVs sold, Racklyeft said.

“Analysts are warning the continued policy uncertainty here will only help China pull farther ahead in the global EV race,” Racklyeft said. “This is the real choice in front of us. Do we want to import the clean vehicles of the future, or design, engineer and build better vehicles here in Detroit and across Michigan?”

Andrew Dueweke, the assistant business manager for the IBEW Local 58, similarly called for people to look past the politics on clean energy.

“Who knows when this investment might be able to come back to the city,” Dueweke said.

Project supported by EBRD and GCF

The launch of all six hydroelectric units of the Qairokkum hydropower plant (QHPP) has marked the completion of a major renewables project in Tajikistan. Rehabilitation measures at QHPP, which provides electricity to 500,000 people in the Sughd province, included concrete dam works and the installation of hydraulic steel components, turbines and electromechanical equipment. As a result, the plant’s installed capacity has increased from 126 MW to 174 MW. The upgrade introduced innovative climate-resilience measures, enabling the plant to cope with the expected impact of climate change on the country’s hydrological systems.

Initiated in 2019, the upgrade was supported by a US$ 196 million financing package organised by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). The package consisted of an US$ 88 million EBRD loan, a US$ 37 million loan from the European Investment Bank, a US$ 50 million Green Climate Fund loan and grant and a US$ 21 million CIF loan and grant to the state-owned power utility Barki Tojik. The project also received support from the governments of Austria and the United Kingdom.

Tajikistan is one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change. Its glacial hydrology and, by extension, its hydropower sector, are highly sensitive to the impacts of climate change, but the project is a model of how carefully designed investments can make hydropower more resilient. This model is likely to be replicated across the country and the wider region.

Hurricane Ida hit the Gulf Coast of the US in 2021. Louisiana bore the brunt of its devastation; Ida was the second-most destructive tropical cyclone on record.

For DEMCO, a not-for-profit, member-owned electric-distribution co-operative, it was an unprecedented crisis. In these moments, an outage management system (OMS) is critical. During the hurricane, Hitachi Energy’s OMS, working in tandem with DEMCO’s other reporting systems, filled in vital gaps, spotting outages before they had been reported so that DEMCO knew exactly where its linemen were needed. Chief engineering and operations officer, Mark Phillips, estimates that without the OMS it would have taken “double, possibly triple” the time to bring power back after the hurricane. Hitachi Energy’s OMS is “state of the art”, he says. “It gives our systems operators full visibility of our grid. There are no blind spots.” Today, the Hitachi Energy OMS delivers insights that DEMCO uses to refine its operations. When it comes to extreme weather, Phillips is phlegmatic: “It’s not a matter of if but when.” Keeping the grid operational demands unceasing courage and hard work. With Hitachi Energy’s OMS, DEMCO’s heroic team has a handy ace up its sleeve.

Developers and landlords with apartment buildings in Detroit say that the situation has become nearly unworkable as a business model, but believe changes in policy would substantially help.

They cite nonpayment of rent from tenants and high Detroit property taxes as two root causes.

Detroit developer Clifford Brown says that Detroit poses unique challenges.

“I am blessed and grateful to do development in the city of Detroit. I love the city of Detroit,” he said. “I’m blessed to do deals in the state of Michigan, but I can’t act like every deal that I do doesn’t have hair on it when deals in other markets don’t. It’s tough to create a scaleable business model. I know everyone is working like hell to find a solution while meeting the needs of residents of the city we serve.”

And it’s a worthy fight, they say.

“I think the challenge that we've seen is a very punitive property tax environment that compresses values for new buyers, (and) that don't necessarily align with what sellers' expectations are in order for them to sell the properties at a palatable price,"" said Matt Jones, managing director for investment sales in the Grand Rapids office of brokerage firm Walker & Dunlop.

There are other issues, such as job growth in the city, said Kevin Dillon, senior managing director of investment sales in the Birmingham office of Berkadia.

“Kids coming out of college, I don’t think they are getting jobs in downtown Detroit like they used to be. The workforce down there isn’t expanding rapidly,"" he said.

Some solutions

There have been some measures that bring help, though developers say more are needed. Detroit has rolled out the PILOT program, which allows payment in lieu of taxes. Property taxes tied to a building’s assessed value are replaced with a percentage of rental revenue. Developers who opt in to PILOT agree to keep rental rates at a below-market rate in exchange for a reduction in taxes, in some cases upwards of 90%, city officials have touted.

Measures other cities are trying, such as the RENTAL Act in Washington, D.C., speed up the eviction process when tenants don’t pay, and are worth a look, local experts say.

But the most meaningful reform, many believe, must come through state and city policies, especially on property taxes.

Jones, the Walker & Dunlop broker, is hopeful for such an outcome.

“I’m optimistic that there can be common sense property tax reform that improves the transaction market,” he said. “You want a healthy transaction market in any city because it encourages more development. It’s a sign of a healthy market when you have a good diversity of capital coming in and out, versus a static transaction market where there are no transactions.”

What if it isn’t solved?

Already, landlords say, units are sitting empty because developers can’t make a profit and can’t find buyers for the buildings. Some have stopped paying the mortgages on the buildings.

It is a rechargeable battery, which can store more energy than traditional lithium-ion batteries. As a result, it can offer greater safety and longer lifespans, as well as being more stable at higher temperatures.

As a result, car manufacturers are turning to this product to run electric vehicles (EVs). These vehicles require batteries which can cope with the weight of the car and is safety-assured. However, these manufacturers have been working on scalable batteries for a decade, attempting to become the first to produce an efficient solid-state battery car.

In theory, solid-state batteries will provide a larger driving range, higher safety and faster charging speeds for EVs. Semi-solid state EVs are already available for purchase in some parts of the world, but full SSBs have been more difficult to build to-scale. Automakers around the world are working hard to bring these batteries to the public and create a safer, longer-lasting EV.

Carmaker Stellantis has partnered with Factorial Energy, a manufacturer of renewable energy semiconducters. Stellantis will be using Factorial's solid-state batteries in its fleet of Dodge Charger Daytona EVs, which are set to be on the road in 2026 as a demonstration fleet.

However, Dongfeng, a Chinese carmaker, has said it will be bringing solid-state EVs to road sooner than expected.

A leading manufacturer

Dongfeng Motor Corporation Limited is a major driver of China's automotive industry. Its products are sold in more than 100 countries around the world and it is placed within the world's Top 500. It is a leader in industrial R&D, manufacturing and marketing.

Its production includes passenger vehicles, commercial vehicles, NEVs, machines and equipment, auto assembles, parts and components, as well as other automobile-related products and services. Alongside full series of vehicles, the company has a selection of new-energy vehicles, including HEV, all-electric and natural gas vehicles.

Now, the company is putting its efforts into the deployment of a solid-state battery EV. It has an R&D staff count of more than 7,000 members, with its own significant automobile test base and self-assembly capability in China.

Dongfeng's leading product

The new fleet is due to come out in September 2026, using a battery with a 350wh/kg energy density. The battery will be capable of reaching a range of 621 miles on full charge once fitted into Dongfeng's fleet of EVs. Its 0.2GWh pilot production line is already established and operational, suggesting the deployment will be smooth-sailing.

The battery is made up of a multi-component layout with a high-capacity ternary cathode, a silicon-carbon anode and an oxide polymer composite solid electrolyte. Dongfeng claims the battery has a high temperature range, meaning it is safe and usable in any climate. According to the carmaker, the solid-state battery has been tested at temperatures as low as -22°F (-30°C), retaining more than 72% of its capacity - as opposed to 60% for liquid-state ternary batteries - and at a high of 266°F (130°C).

At present, Dongfeng has not reported how long the battery takes to reach full charge, but it is already working on a fast-charging version of the solid-state battery, which is planned to be deployed across vehicles in December 2027. Furthermore, it is exploring the concept of a sulfide-based solid-state battery with an energy density of 500 Wh/kg.

As the company makes strides in innovation with its dedicated team, it may be the first to release its fleet of solid-state battery cars.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/72b890fb2faac415a679eb755b87608a:db6e90bc6251ac00f2a56dc23b1b9339/1afc1018a5c09b427ba4012f18dcd55b-1536x1024.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 06:58:08.723070

(AP) — The Trump administration has once again extended the life of a Michigan coal-fired power plant that was supposed to close last May as the utility Consumers Energy transitions to cleaner sources of electricity.

The U.S. Energy Department says there are “emergency conditions” that require the J.H. Campbell power plant to remain open to meet electrical demand in the central U.S. Otherwise, the government warned Tuesday, homes and businesses might go dark.

Critics scoff at that claim, and environmental groups and Michigan’s attorney general have gone to court to try to overturn orders keeping the plant online.

“The costs of unnecessarily running this jalopy coal plant just continue to mount,” Earthjustice lawyer Michael Lenoff said.

The Campbell plant opened in 1962 near Lake Michigan in western Michigan’s Ottawa County. It can generate up to 1,450 megawatts of electricity to serve up to 1 million people.

Consumers Energy planned to close it May 31, but the Energy Department ordered it to stay open for three months, citing a need for reliable electricity during the hot summer.

That decision has since been extended twice, and the latest order lasts until Feb. 17.

Consumers Energy acknowledged Wednesday that it will continue operating the plant. The net expense through September was pegged at $80 million, which will be shared by customers who are part of a multistate electric grid, the utility said in a securities filing in October.

Michigan utility regulators criticized the May order to keep Campbell open but declined to comment on the latest extension.

As the COP30 climate summit wraps up in Brazil’s Amazonian hub of Belém, activists are dispersing after two weeks of rain forest photo ops, protest disruptions and impassioned speeches on slashing carbon emissions. But participants sidestepped the stark reality: The actions of western nations — including Canada — have less and less sway over the trajectory of global warming.

For decades now, western governments, especially in Europe, have prioritized carbon cuts over higher economic growth, spending trillions of dollars to convince consumers to adopt electric cars and accept more costly, less reliable wind and solar power. Yet all these expensive efforts are barely making a dent.

The global decarbonization rate (measured as CO₂ emissions over GDP) has remained roughly constant since the 1960s, with no change following the 2015 Paris Agreement. Global emissions have skyrocketed, reaching a new record last year. Despite this, climate campaigners demand that the world quadruple its decarbonization rate.

Article content

Why are emissions still increasing when the EU and the United States spent more than $700 billion last year on green investments like solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, hydrogen, electric cars and power grids? Because rich-world emissions matter very little for climate change in the 21st century.

Article content

The West did dominate emissions in previous centuries, but future emissions will come overwhelmingly from China, India, Africa, Brazil, Indonesia and many other countries clambering out of poverty. One recent scenario shows that under current policies, just 13 per cent of CO₂ emissions over the rest of this century will come from the mostly rich and western countries of the OECD.

Article content

Article content

The West’s pledge to achieve net-zero by 2050 will cost hundreds of trillions of dollars yet do little. Most likely, the policy will simply shift energy-intensive production to the rest of the world with little overall impact on emissions — just as EV battery manufacturing has shifted to China’s coal-powered economy.

North America’s power shortage could offer a key window for China’s equipment manufacturing industry to expand abroad.","(Yicai) Nov. 20 -- North America is facing mounting power shortages driven by explosive growth in demand for artificial intelligence computing, creating a significant opportunity for Chinese companies to expand overseas, according to a new research report by China International Capital Corporation.

CICC, a leading investment bank, said the acceleration of AI model training by major US cloud service providers is straining an aging American power grid, where coal and gas facilities are being retired faster than new capacity can be built. Constructing new gas-fired power plants typically takes more than three years, while nuclear projects require five to 10 years.

US net electricity imports surged 125 percent year on year to 20.94 terawatt-hours in the first nine months of this year, data from the US Energy Information Administration showed, and CICC forecasts the country could face an average annual power shortfall of about 15 gigawatts over the next five years.

Gas turbines are emerging as the most viable short-term solution due to their fast response and short construction cycles, CICC noted. Global leaders such as GE and Siemens are expanding output, while Chinese manufacturers involved in contract manufacturing and supplying key components such as blades, castings, and materials are expected to benefit.

CICC estimated that the supply-demand gap for transformers in North America could reach as high as 66 percent from 2024 to 2027, positioning China as a crucial supplier to help close the deficit. China exported USD6.5 billion worth of transformers in the first nine months of this year, up 39 percent from a year earlier. Energy storage systems are also set to gain from regulatory requirements tied to the “roller coaster” electricity consumption patterns of data centers.

Photovoltaic renewable energy is becoming an important supplementary power source due to its rapid deployment capabilities, and frontier technologies such as solid oxide fuel cells are also attracting attention. Rising demand for aluminum used in power cables may further support the non-ferrous metals sector.

Analysts said that in the new stage of China-US economic and trade relations, Chinese companies are accelerating their integration into global value chains by leveraging institutional advantages, economies of scale, and industrial cluster effects. North America’s power shortage could offer a key window for China’s equipment manufacturing industry to expand abroad.

,North Carolina American Energy ,2025-11-20 11:00:23+00:00,News From The States,A modest proposal for AI data centers: Invest in small and local solar projects,News From The States,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/modest-proposal-ai-data-centers-invest-small-and-local-solar-projects,"Over the past decade, Virginia has become home to more than 650 data centers — the largest concentration on Earth — including roughly 150 hyperscale facilities operated by Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Meta.
Now is the moment for the commonwealth to adopt a straightforward, market-based solution that delivers more affordable energy and ensures data centers pay their fair share — all for only a modest contribution.
We suspected data centers were creating an energy crisis for Virginia.
Here’s the proposal: Data centers would contribute a small percentage of their avoided state sales-tax liability each year toward purchasing Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs) under the distributed generation (DG) carve-out for small-scale solar projects operating in Virginia.
Our modest proposal offers a different creed: Multiplicity — where one small investment multiplies benefits across the commonwealth’s schools, hospitals, and communities.","Over the past decade, Virginia has become home to more than 650 data centers — the largest concentration on Earth — including roughly 150 hyperscale facilities operated by Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Meta. Loudoun County alone hosts nearly 200 operating sites, with more than 100 additional facilities in development.

Regulators and lawmakers are now confronting soaring peak demand and rising grid costs for Virginia ratepayers. Now is the moment for the commonwealth to adopt a straightforward, market-based solution that delivers more affordable energy and ensures data centers pay their fair share — all for only a modest contribution.

Data center growth has come at a cost. They already consume more than one-quarter of Virginia’s electricity, a share projected to approach half of statewide demand by 2030. Dominion Energy has told regulators that serving this new hyperscale load will require billions of dollars in new generation and transmission infrastructure — costs increasingly passed on to ordinary Virginians through rate hikes.

As it is, Virginia imports roughly 39% of its electricity — more than any other state — according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, buying much of that power at a premium. Options to meet that demand require five to ten or more years of development, whether new natural gas, small modular nuclear, or utility-scale solar. In contrast, small-scale rooftop and ground-mounted solar can be built and interconnected in less than a year.

Since 2010, Virginia’s sales- and use-tax exemption has provided data-center operators with more than $2 billion in cumulative subsidies, justified as job creation. Yet most jobs were temporary construction work.

We suspected data centers were creating an energy crisis for Virginia. Now it’s official.

The Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC) reported last year that the sector supports about 74,000 jobs statewide, mostly indirect or short-term, while a typical operating facility employs only around 50 full-time workers. In FY 2023 alone, this exemption cost taxpayers $928 million.

A modest, market-based solution

Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger said it best in her acceptance speech: “Data centers need to pay their fair share.” Virginia can take her message to heart by inviting the industry to make a small, voluntary, high-impact contribution toward the commonwealth’s clean-energy goals and local development.

Here’s the proposal: Data centers would contribute a small percentage of their avoided state sales-tax liability each year toward purchasing Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs) under the distributed generation (DG) carve-out for small-scale solar projects operating in Virginia. Each SREC represents one megawatt-hour of solar generation; purchasing them helps finance projects and provides verifiable carbon offsets to the buyer.

The program would support any and all solar systems under 3 MW on public schools, hospitals, community colleges and municipal buildings — projects that lower energy bills and strengthen local economies.

With Democrats in charge, Spanberger targets lower energy bills — and higher costs for data centers

Using JLARC’s FY 2023 figure of $928 million in annual tax savings, a 5% annual contribution would yield about $46 million per year for the purchase of Virginia-generated SRECs — enough to help finance over 500 MW of distributed solar capacity annually to benefit schools and communities.

According to the U.S. Department of Energy’s Jobs and Economic Impact (JEDI) model, this voluntary program would each year:

Leverage $1.1 billion in private-sector investment in distributed solar

Generate more than $700 million in local economic activity

Create over 2,800 good-paying Virginia jobs.

All of this would be achieved without adding a single cent to ratepayer bills, while reducing taxpayer subsidies and helping stabilize Virginia’s solar industry by offsetting the abrupt and disruptive phase-down of federal investment tax credits.

From additionality to multiplicity

For years, the technology industry has subscribed to what might be called the Gospel of Additionality — the idea that eco-virtue is earned by sourcing the largest and cheapest quantities of clean energy. This approach has sent corporate energy dollars to Texas wind farms and Arizona solar plants while companies continued to draw fossil-based power here in Virginia.

Our modest proposal offers a different creed: Multiplicity — where one small investment multiplies benefits across the commonwealth’s schools, hospitals, and communities.

By purchasing Virginia DG SRECs data-center operators could:

Lower energy costs for public schools, hospitals, and local governments at no capital cost to them

Help offset summer coincident peak demand in the Mid-Atlantic PJM grid area more quickly and affordably than any other generation option

Reduce taxpayer burden by cutting energy costs for public institutions

Avoid ratepayer-funded SREC subsidies through a voluntary, market-based mechanism

Create durable local jobs and workforce training tied to installation, operations and maintenance

A good-neighbor contribution would show that an industry running on public infrastructure can also reinvest in the communities that power it. Data-center operators could help schools, hospitals and small towns across the commonwealth generate clean, affordable solar energy — a sure and equitable way for them to pay their fair share.

And importantly, this modest proposal is designed to complement, not replace, a longer-term, holistic strategy for meeting Virginia’s energy needs by offering a simple, fast, and low-cost way to buy the commonwealth the time it urgently needs.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-98/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/data-centers-va1763634255.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=lAnRZoNU,N,,2025-11-20 12:02:52.757462

Wopke Hoekstra, Commissioner for Climate, Net Zero and Clean Growth, said he wanted “to be crystal clear” repeatedly at yesterday’s European Commission press conference.

He insisted the bloc is “doubling down on the energy transition,” frequently citing policy measures such as Fit for 55 and the European Green Deal.

Europe’s main climate targets are to achieve climate neutrality by 2050 and to reduce net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared with 1990 levels.

Accompanying him, Lidia Pereira, heading the European Parliament delegation to COP30, highlighted Europe’s aim to be a major hub for new technologies, including carbon capture and storage, and encouraged Brazil to follow its lead.

“It is necessary to invest in clean technologies – environment and economy are not against each other,” she said.

But beneath the unified messaging, not everything is clear on a range of fronts.

It remains to be seen how quickly Europe will implement changes, which is one of COP30’s central themes. And Europe’s push on climate finance is under pressure from strains on public budgets and geopolitics.

Moreover, India, China and other countries are challenging CBAM in climate talks, ahead of the financially binding regime starting on 1 January 2026. The price of CBAM certificates will be pegged to the weekly average auction price of allowances in the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS).

Environmental groups are concerned the EU’s policies are not ambitious enough and are not providing a strong enough roadmap for transitioning away from fossil fuels.

However, Europe’s overall carbon emissions fell in 2024, with preliminary estimates showing a further 2.5% reduction compared with 2023 levels.

This is part of a long-term trend driven by renewable energy, higher energy efficiency and decarbonisation of the power sector.

Hoekstra stressed that 94% of emissions take place outside the EU. The implication is that Europe’s actions won’t make or break the global climate. But he said it would work hard tackling the 6% it can control.

“What matters is that we focus not only on ‘transitioning away’ [the COP28 pledge] but also on the doubling and tripling of commitments,” he said.

“What the whole world needs is more sustainable economic growth – not the type of growth we’ve had before, And an [economic] distribution that is fairer than it is today.

Shapiro abandons Pennsylvania's landmark climate initiative",News From The States,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/after-years-sparring-gov-shapiro-abandons-pennsylvanias-landmark-climate-initiative,"Pennsylvania is the fourth largest greenhouse gas emitter in the nation, and for years, RGGI was considered its landmark climate policy.
Pennsylvania is now the first state with a Democratic governor to leave the regional climate program, which includes New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts.
The Environmental Protection Agency under President Donald Trump has attempted to repeal those funds, a move that the Shapiro administration has countered with a lawsuit.
The day after the state budget was signed, the Shapiro administration filed applications to discontinue its involvement in both court cases.
“For years, Republicans who have led the Senate have used RGGI as an excuse to stall substantive conversations about energy,” Shapiro said.","This article was first published by Capital & Main.

When the Republican minority leader of Pennsylvania’s state House took the podium, as final floor debate over the state’s months-delayed state budget kicked off, he was resolute: A landmark climate initiative — which he dismissed as a “specter” — was holding back the state.

“After today,” said Rep. Jesse Topper, who is from south central Pennsylvania, “that specter will be gone.”

As he spoke, he celebrated what environmentalists and some Democratic lawmakers have for weeks been warning the state not to do: Leave the regional carbon-trading program that it set out to enter in 2019.

A key pillar of former Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf’s climate legacy, the 10-state compact caps the amount of planet-warming emissions that power plants within it are allowed to release. It also requires the plants to purchase the ability to emit carbon via quarterly auctions, whose proceeds are invested in environmental initiatives like energy efficiency and renewable energy projects. Trade unions and fossil fuel industry trade groups have long argued that the carbon trading program would stymie the state’s energy industry and lead to higher utility bills.

Environmentalists, meanwhile, saw the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, known as RGGI, as an effective way to curb emissions from the power sector, though some argued the program did not go far enough. Pennsylvania is the fourth largest greenhouse gas emitter in the nation, and for years, RGGI was considered its landmark climate policy.

The state’s entry into the compact fueled years of partisan sparring and two unresolved lawsuits that await a verdict from the state Supreme Court. As part of the deal to drop out of the compact, Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro’s administration, a party in both cases, is pulling out of the lawsuits.

Democrats spent years staving off attacks from Republicans and the fossil fuel industry over the program.

To end a months-long budget impasse, Democrats did not just fold to these sustained attacks on Nov. 12, but conceded to offer RGGI as a “bargaining chip” to bring Republicans back to the bargaining table, Spotlight PA reported. Pennsylvania is now the first state with a Democratic governor to leave the regional climate program, which includes New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts.

“It was a shocking reversal on a very significant climate policy,” said Jen Quinn, legislative and political director at the Pennsylvania chapter of the Sierra Club. “I don’t think there’s any other way to say it besides [we are] shocked and disappointed.”

The move came as part of a $50.1 billion budget that Shapiro signed into law 135 days after the June 30 annual deadline to do so — ending a bitter impasse that left schools, counties and nonprofits without funding, and that overlapped with the 43-day federal government shutdown.

Gov. Shapiro’s office did not comment on the record regarding the move to pull out of RGGI.

Tucked into the budget were a mixed bag of climate policies, including a renewed $25 million for a hotly demanded grant program to install solar panels on schools — the same appropriation the program received last year. The budget also repeals the hold state lawmakers put on the use of millions in federal funds for low-income residential solar projects last year. The Environmental Protection Agency under President Donald Trump has attempted to repeal those funds, a move that the Shapiro administration has countered with a lawsuit. Despite progress at the state level, the program is still in limbo.

“It’s like a drop in the bucket,” David Masur, executive director of nonprofit PennEnvironment, said of the impact of solar funding in this year’s budget compared to the losses that come with eliminating RGGI (pronounced Reggie).

The deal also includes new provisions requiring state regulators to hit shorter deadlines throughout the permitting process for certain industrial projects, deeming some approved if those deadlines are missed — a move environmentalists fear could lead to projects being rubber-stamped. A spokesperson for the Shapiro administration told Capital & Main the measure amounts to “providing more certainty for businesses while still providing the environmental and public health protections that Pennsylvanians deserve.”

The budget also includes a provision requiring state utility regulators to audit the way the region’s grid operator, PJM, calculates future demand on the grid, a process known as load forecasting. If PJM overanticipates demand, taxpayers could get stuck footing the bill for unneeded energy projects. If it underestimates it, they could see rolling blackouts. Getting it right is crucial, advocates say.

Though she considers solar funding and increased attention to load forecasting as wins for consumers and the climate, Quinn, the Sierra Club legislative director, said this year’s budget package is, on the whole, “a step backwards.”

Rep. Greg Vitali, Democratic chair of the House Environmental and Natural Resource Protection Committee, didn’t mince words. “Bad budget for the environment,” he told Capital & Main shortly after the budget deal was adopted Wednesday.

Vitali, who is from Delaware County, north of Philadelphia, broke ranks with his party, one of just four House Democrats to do so, in voting against a key budget bill which contained the language removing Pennsylvania from RGGI. He was despondent on the House floor in the minutes leading up to the vote.

“I understand that environmental protection is not highly valued in this General Assembly,” he told his colleagues. “I also understand that my words will not affect any, or many, votes.”

Though he waffled on RGGI while on the campaign trail in 2022, after taking office the following year Gov. Shapiro convened a working group that brought together parties that were historically on opposite sides of the debate over the controversial program — environmentalists, labor unions, consumer advocates and energy producers.

Masur, the nonprofit director, was part of that working group and left those talks feeling optimistic. Watching RGGI’s repeal felt like “a pretty big tectonic shift,” he said.

After nine meetings, the working group concluded in 2023 that a cap-and-invest program was the best way to reduce emissions from the power sector while generating funds for renewable energy. In response, Shapiro introduced the Pennsylvania Climate Emissions Reduction Act, known as PACER, which would require power plants to pay for the greenhouse gasses they emit — funds that would be rebated on consumer’s utility bills and go toward pollution reduction programs. It was introduced in the 2023-2024 legislative session, then again in 2025 as part of a package of bills the governor dubbed the “Lightning Plan.”

No components of the Lightning Plan were part of this year’s final budget deal. In fact, PACER has stalled for close to two years. Had it reached the governor’s desk and been signed, it would then have removed the state from RGGI in favor of the state-run alternative.

That Democrats did not secure an alternative to RGGI, or another meaningful climate program, in exchange for pulling out of the compact marked a wasted opportunity, environmentalists say.

“The RGGI repeal was shocking and disappointing,” Masur said. “I think it’s made worse by the fact that it wasn’t really like there was some quid pro quo.”

The move comes as the state is preparing for a slate of newpower plants to come online to provide energy to data centers for the artificial intelligence sector, likely increasing residents’ utility rates in the process.

Republicans applauded the withdrawal from RGGI as a win for consumers’ electricity bills. The Commonwealth Foundation, a right-wing thinktank, alongside industrial labor unions and the energy industry have asserted that RGGI would increase consumer bills by 30%.

Environmentalists say this is a fallacy. For instance, in 2023, the University of Pennsylvania Kleinman Center for Energy Policy found that the state would gain as much as $148 million in 2030 by participating in RGGI, with no impact on consumer electricity rates or employment levels. Others have estimated that the state lost out on closer to $1 billionin a single year. At least one analysis from 2019 found electricity prices had dropped across RGGI member states while raising money for projects like energy efficiency and renewables, which environmentalists argue will save consumers money in the long run.

Though Pennsylvania was technically part of the compact, its participation was halted by a 2022 injunction and has since been tied up in litigation. Pennsylvania has never participated in an RGGI auction. Shapiro’s administration, meanwhile, has defended the program in state court, spending millions in the process. At question in these cases is whether RGGI constitutes a tax or a fee, which would determine whether the Wolf administration overstepped in entering the compact by executive order instead of seeking approval from the legislative branch, which was then controlled by Republicans. The day after the state budget was signed, the Shapiro administration filed applications to discontinue its involvement in both court cases.

Robert Routh, policy director of climate and energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said that in crafting the budget deal, the administration was taking a gamble on the likelihood that the state Supreme Court would strike the program down on its own. Such a gamble is shortsighted, he said. A Supreme Court verdict could help shape climate policy for years to come.

“We don’t know how the case would have been decided, but there were key legal issues pending to determine how this administration and future administrations design rules to control air pollution in Pennsylvania,” he said. Now, “We won’t have that guidance or clarity.”

Shortly before signing the series of budget bills into law, including the fiscal code that struck down RGGI, Shapiro said at a press conference that the move would alleviate a sticking point that had long hampered negotiations.

“For years, Republicans who have led the Senate have used RGGI as an excuse to stall substantive conversations about energy,” Shapiro said. “Today, that excuse is gone.

“I’m looking forward to aggressively pushing for policies that create more jobs in the energy sector, bring more clean energy onto our grid and reduce the cost of energy for all Pennsylvanians,” he vowed.

Environmental watchdogs remain dubious. Many of these policies require buy-in from the divided state Legislature — the lack of which caused the ultimate demise of RGGI in Pennsylvania. “It’s pretty clear, in this General Assembly, no meaningful legislation is going to be passed to address climate change,” Vitali said on the House floor ahead of the budget vote.

Quinn agreed that none of Shapiro’s past climate pitches have seemed to come with much political capital. But she said she hopes to hold him to his promise nonetheless.

“We don’t have anything similar on the books,” she said. “We want to see that come from him.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-96/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/power-station-springdale-1024x5401763634051.jpeg?h=dc8f5cd0&itok=dV5zK74f,N,,2025-11-20 11:04:45.332436

Now is the moment for the commonwealth to adopt a straightforward, market-based solution that delivers more affordable energy and ensures data centers pay their fair share — all for only a modest contribution.

Loudoun County alone hosts nearly 200 operating sites, with more than 100 additional facilities in development.

Regulators and lawmakers are now confronting soaring peak demand and rising grid costs for Virginia ratepayers. Now is the moment for the commonwealth to adopt a straightforward, market-based solution that delivers more affordable energy and ensures data centers pay their fair share — all for only a modest contribution.

Data center growth has come at a cost. They already consume more than one-quarter of Virginia’s electricity, a share projected to approach half of statewide demand by 2030. Dominion Energy has told regulators that serving this new hyperscale load will require billions of dollars in new generation and transmission infrastructure — costs increasingly passed on to ordinary Virginians through rate hikes.

As it is, Virginia imports roughly 39% of its electricity — more than any other state — according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, buying much of that power at a premium. Options to meet that demand require five to ten or more years of development, whether new natural gas, small modular nuclear, or utility-scale solar. In contrast, small-scale rooftop and ground-mounted solar can be built and interconnected in less than a year.

Since 2010, Virginia’s sales- and use-tax exemption has provided data-center operators with more than $2 billion in cumulative subsidies, justified as job creation. Yet most jobs were temporary construction work.

We suspected data centers were creating an energy crisis for Virginia. Now it’s official.

The Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC) reported last year that the sector supports about 74,000 jobs statewide, mostly indirect or short-term, while a typical operating facility employs only around 50 full-time workers. In FY 2023 alone, this exemption cost taxpayers $928 million.

A modest, market-based solution

Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger said it best in her acceptance speech: “Data centers need to pay their fair share.” Virginia can take her message to heart by inviting the industry to make a small, voluntary, high-impact contribution toward the commonwealth’s clean-energy goals and local development.

Here’s the proposal: Data centers would contribute a small percentage of their avoided state sales-tax liability each year toward purchasing Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs) under the distributed generation (DG) carve-out for small-scale solar projects operating in Virginia. Each SREC represents one megawatt-hour of solar generation; purchasing them helps finance projects and provides verifiable carbon offsets to the buyer.

The program would support any and all solar systems under 3 MW on public schools, hospitals, community colleges and municipal buildings — projects that lower energy bills and strengthen local economies.

With Democrats in charge, Spanberger targets lower energy bills — and higher costs for data centers

Using JLARC’s FY 2023 figure of $928 million in annual tax savings, a 5% annual contribution would yield about $46 million per year for the purchase of Virginia-generated SRECs — enough to help finance over 500 MW of distributed solar capacity annually to benefit schools and communities.

According to the U.S. Department of Energy’s Jobs and Economic Impact (JEDI) model, this voluntary program would each year:

Leverage $1.1 billion in private-sector investment in distributed solar

Generate more than $700 million in local economic activity

Create over 2,800 good-paying Virginia jobs.

All of this would be achieved without adding a single cent to ratepayer bills, while reducing taxpayer subsidies and helping stabilize Virginia’s solar industry by offsetting the abrupt and disruptive phase-down of federal investment tax credits.

From additionality to multiplicity

For years, the technology industry has subscribed to what might be called the Gospel of Additionality — the idea that eco-virtue is earned by sourcing the largest and cheapest quantities of clean energy. This approach has sent corporate energy dollars to Texas wind farms and Arizona solar plants while companies continued to draw fossil-based power here in Virginia.

Our modest proposal offers a different creed: Multiplicity — where one small investment multiplies benefits across the commonwealth’s schools, hospitals, and communities.

By purchasing Virginia DG SRECs data-center operators could:

Lower energy costs for public schools, hospitals, and local governments at no capital cost to them

Help offset summer coincident peak demand in the Mid-Atlantic PJM grid area more quickly and affordably than any other generation option

Reduce taxpayer burden by cutting energy costs for public institutions

Avoid ratepayer-funded SREC subsidies through a voluntary, market-based mechanism

Create durable local jobs and workforce training tied to installation, operations and maintenance

A good-neighbor contribution would show that an industry running on public infrastructure can also reinvest in the communities that power it. Data-center operators could help schools, hospitals and small towns across the commonwealth generate clean, affordable solar energy — a sure and equitable way for them to pay their fair share.

And importantly, this modest proposal is designed to complement, not replace, a longer-term, holistic strategy for meeting Virginia’s energy needs by offering a simple, fast, and low-cost way to buy the commonwealth the time it urgently needs.",https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/data-centers-VA.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 06:58:33.943559

Tom Davis represents Beaufort and Jasper counties in the South Carolina Senate.","South Carolina stands at a crossroads. Our state faces surging electricity demand driven by population growth, advanced manufacturing, and data center expansion. Meanwhile, two partially built nuclear reactors at VC Summer in Fairfield County have sat dormant since July 2017. The Santee Cooper Board’s unanimous decision on Oct. 24 to enter final negotiations with Brookfield Asset Management to sell and complete those reactors with private capital changes everything.

This proposed deal transforms an abandoned liability into a strategic asset. It delivers 2,200 megawatts of reliable baseload power without asking taxpayers for another dime, positioning South Carolina as the national leader in America's nuclear resurgence.

Nuclear power remains the only reliable, scalable energy source capable of meeting our state’s growing needs. While wind and solar have their place, they cannot provide the around-the-clock baseload power that manufacturers, data centers, and households depend on. As China accelerates nuclear deployment and states like Texas and Tennessee expand their energy portfolios, South Carolina cannot afford to sit on the sidelines.

The Westinghouse AP1000 reactor design represents a quantum leap in safety. It features passive safety systems that rely on gravity and natural circulation rather than pumps, meaning the reactor can safely shut down and cool itself even during complete power loss. This eliminates vulnerabilities that led to accidents like Three Mile Island and Fukushima. If power systems fail, physics takes over, with water naturally flowing downward to cool the reactor core, and heat naturally rising to dissipate through the containment structure. No human intervention, electricity, or backup generators needed.

The deal has been thoroughly de-risked. Since July 2017, Westinghouse has successfully delivered six AP1000 units worldwide, including Georgia’s Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which now power more than one million homes. Fourteen more units are under construction in China. Construction efficiencies improved 30 percent between Vogtle’s third and fourth units, and the design is licensed by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission until 2046.

Critically, Santee Cooper has maintained VC Summer in good condition since 2017, keeping the site among the best-preserved nuclear assets globally. We’re not starting from scratch; we're finishing what we started.

The financial structure protects South Carolina ratepayers while securing massive benefits. Brookfield's proposal includes a multi-billion-dollar ratepayer relief package and provides Santee Cooper with percentage ownership and power share through a structure that delivers below-market electricity rates without equity investment or project-level financial risk.

Brookfield brings extraordinary resources: approximately $1 trillion in assets under management, including $500 billion invested in U.S. infrastructure. As majority owner of Westinghouse, Brookfield uniquely aligns capital, technology, and execution expertise.

Beyond electricity generation, Brookfield's investment will rebuild South Carolina's nuclear workforce and strengthen the state’s manufacturing ecosystem. The project will prioritize South Carolina vendors and suppliers, creating sustained demand for local businesses. Through partnerships with trade schools and universities, Brookfield will establish comprehensive training pipelines for nuclear technicians, welders, and engineers.

This commitment to workforce development will revitalize the Midlands economy and position South Carolina as a hub for high-tech manufacturing and nuclear research. The ripple effects will extend far beyond Fairfield County, creating opportunities for the next generation of South Carolinians in careers that didn’t exist when the project was first conceived.

Honda Expands Commitment to Regenerative Agriculture Through Carbon by Indigo

Honda has joined Carbon by Indigo, a leading soil carbon program supporting U.S. farmers in adopting regenerative agriculture practices that enhance soil health and deliver measurable climate benefits. As part of this initiative, the company is purchasing soil carbon removal credits equivalent to 1,800 metric tons of carbon dioxide.

The investment supports farmers implementing practices such as cover cropping, reduced tillage, diversified rotations, and optimized nitrogen use—all methods shown to improve soil structure, reduce erosion, and increase long-term field productivity. These efforts generate verified carbon credits by storing more carbon in agricultural soils.

Farmers participating in the Carbon by Indigo program receive technical guidance tailored to their crop systems and local field conditions. The program’s credits are verified by Aster Global Environmental Solutions and issued by the Climate Action Reserve.

Honda Initiative Delivers Local Impact and Supports Climate Resilience

Through its participation, Honda is supporting approximately 150 farmers across states where it has operational facilities, including Alabama, Indiana, North Carolina, Ohio, and South Carolina. Collectively, these farmers manage more than 214,000 acres of cropland where regenerative practices are being implemented.

On average, the practices deployed under this project conserved an estimated 69,000 gallons of water per metric ton of carbon removed, emphasizing the dual benefits of improved soil function and climate adaptation.

“For over 40 years, Honda has supported farmers near our Ohio operations through conservation programs,” said Mahjabeen Qadir, sustainability strategy lead at Honda Development & Manufacturing of America, LLC. “Now, Honda is building on that history by supporting regenerative agriculture practices that help farmers manage climate challenges and maintain healthy farmland for future generations.”

Dean Banks, CEO of Indigo Ag, added: “The Carbon by Indigo program builds prosperity from the ground up, with tangible benefits for local communities and their environment.”

Advancing Broader Decarbonization Strategy

The collaboration is part of a wider sustainability effort by Honda to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and use high-quality offsets only for residual emissions that cannot yet be eliminated. Current initiatives include:

Transitioning to battery-electric and fuel cell electric vehicles

Tree-planting programs supporting biodiversity

Home energy and vehicle energy management technologies

Increasing energy efficiency and low-carbon energy use in manufacturing

Expanding hydrogen fuel cell solutions for commercial and industrial applications

DALLAS, TEXAS (November 19, 2025) – Monday, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin shared 100 additional environmental accomplishments EPA has achieved in the last 100 days, recognizing 300 days of fulfilling the agency’s statutory obligations, and delivering clean air, land, and water for all Americans under President Donald Trump’s leadership.

EPA Region 6 led the response to the Smitty’s Supply fire in Roseland, Louisiana, to remove over 11 million gallons of waste from the Tangipahoa River and surrounding waterways and engage with over 3,000 residents. Region 6 also issued a Safe Drinking Water Act permit for ExxonMobil’s Rose Low Carbon Solutions Class VI injection wells in Jefferson County and a Clean Air Act permit to Texas GulfLink for a deepwater port southeast of Freeport. These permits enable significant projects to move forward, creating jobs and boosting the nation’s energy economy. Region 6 also provided oversight of the depressurization of four flanged tritium waste containers at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. Air monitoring for tritium indicated no deviation from background levels.

Nationwide, this progress includes announcing a proposed rule that establishes a clear, durable, common-sense definition of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS), completing 100 days of “pressure testing” Tijuana-San Diego wastewater projects from the July 2025 U.S.-Mexico Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and accelerating timelines by nine months, secured our border from dangerous illegal pesticides through enforcement action, led emergency response efforts and cleanup efforts in communities across the nation, and so much more.

These 100 actions build on Administrator Zeldin’s list of 100 pro-environmental actions taken by the agency during President Trump’s First 100 Days in office and another 100 pro-environmental actions highlighted at the 200-day milestone to total 300 featured accomplishments.

“We are thrilled to announce another 100 top accomplishments from the last 100 days in our mission to meet our statutory duties and defend human health and environmental quality,” said EPA Administrator Zeldin. “The Trump EPA is showing that we can be exceptional environmental stewards while Powering the Great American Comeback. 300 days, 300 major environmental wins – this is the energy that propels us forward and the pace that motivates us. We will keep working tirelessly to secure success after success for America’s environment and families nationwide.”

“EPA Region 6 is home to much of our nation’s energy, industry, and agriculture production as well as diverse landscapes and natural resources. Under the Trump Administration, our team has shown we can fulfill our mission to protect human health and the environment while not getting in the way of the economic development that’s Powering the Great American Comeback,” said Regional Administrator Scott Mason. “We have accomplished a great deal in less than a year, and we’ll keep pushing to do even more for the environment, the economy, and the American people.”

This snapshot represents the great work done by the agency on a daily basis as EPA continues to fulfill its core mission of protecting human health and the environment, while committing to commonsense policies that drive down prices, unleash American energy, advance permitting reform and cooperative federalism, make America the AI capital of the world, and revitalize the auto industry.

,Congress,2025-11-20 10:01:49+00:00,Inside Climate News,Congress Axes Biden-Era Protections That Shielded Alaskan Wetlands From Drilling,"Carl David Goette-Luciak, Lisa Sorg",,,,,https://insideclimatenews.org/news/20112025/congress-axes-alaska-wetlands-drilling-protections/,"The U.S. House of Representatives voted Tuesday to strike down protections against oil drilling in some of the most diverse ecosystems and wildest lands left in North America.
The vote overturns environmental protections put in place during the Biden administration, which shielded large swaths of Alaskan tundra from new oil and gas leasing.
Although the Biden-era rules still allowed for drilling in around 52 percent of the reserve, large swaths were saved for preservation.
Those concerns drove the Biden administration to put in place stronger protections for special areas with environmental or cultural significance.
Under the reversion to the 2020 plan, roughly 82 percent of the reserve will again be open to new drilling.","The U.S. House of Representatives voted Tuesday to strike down protections against oil drilling in some of the most diverse ecosystems and wildest lands left in North America. The resolution passed relatively quietly, but the bill will have an enormous impact on millions of acres in northern Alaska, the subject of a decades-long fight over conservation and drilling in the Arctic.

The vote overturns environmental protections put in place during the Biden administration, which shielded large swaths of Alaskan tundra from new oil and gas leasing. Alaska’s National Petroleum Reserve encompasses roughly 23 million acres of land in the north of the state, making it the largest block of public land in the United States. The passage Tuesday of Senate Joint Resolution 80 nullifies the Bureau of Land Management’s (BLM) 2022 rules governing the National Petroleum Reserve, which closed off roughly half of the reserve to oil and gas projects.

Although the Biden-era rules still allowed for drilling in around 52 percent of the reserve, large swaths were saved for preservation. Those protected zones included key wildlife habitats, lands used by local communities and special areas like Teshekpuk Lake, one of the most diverse wetland ecosystems in the Arctic and a crucial area of passage for migratory bird populations.

Arkansas Republican Rep. Bruce Westerman, who chairs the House Committee on Natural Resources, described the “resource-rich lands” in Alaska as “indispensable to unleashing American energy and mineral dominance” in a statement and celebrated the bill’s passage as a boon to Alaska’s economy, one that would “create jobs and promote access to affordable energy for years to come.” Westerman’s framing of the issue has been echoed by some Alaskan advocacy groups, including the Indigenous group Voice of the Arctic Inupiat, which expressed hopes that new drilling would boost tax revenue and improve state services.

The change comes amid a wave of Republican-led efforts to reverse Biden-era constraints on fossil fuel production, part of a larger push under President Donald Trump to increase domestic drilling and scrap environmental guardrails that constrain the energy sector. Alaska is a key battleground for those efforts, with the Department of the Interior estimating that the National Petroleum Reserve holds up to 25 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 8.7 billion barrels of oil that could be extracted.

But environmental groups have been swift to point out there’s more than just fossil fuels in the nation’s largest federally managed land area. “This vote will authorize the fossil fuel industry’s continued destruction of habitat and landscapes that are critical for wildlife to survive,” Robert Dewey of the U.S. conservation group Defenders of Wildlife, said in a statement following the Senate vote.

While Republican majorities pushed the measure through the Senate last month and on Tuesday through the House, a few Democrats also backed the environmental rollbacks. In the Senate, Pennsylvania Democrat John Fetterman voted with Republicans and on Tuesday, Texas Democrats Henry Cuellar and Vicente Gonzalez joined Jim Costa of California to vote in favor. President Trump is expected to sign the measure.

With the BLM’s 2022 protections erased, rules governing the reserve will revert to the 2020 plan adopted during Trump’s first term, which opened more than 80 percent of the lands to potential oil and gas leasing—including sensitive sections of the Teshekpuk Lake Special Area that had been off limits for decades.

Environmental groups warned in 2020 that the plan would punch roads and pipelines through delicate wetlands, disrupt migration routes for caribou and waterfowl and fragment habitats in complex, interconnected ecosystems in the Arctic. Those concerns drove the Biden administration to put in place stronger protections for special areas with environmental or cultural significance. Three years later, those safeguards are on the verge of being dismantled entirely. Under the reversion to the 2020 plan, roughly 82 percent of the reserve will again be open to new drilling.

The National Petroleum Reserve has historically been framed as a dormant bank stocked with fuel, set aside in 1923 as a strategic oil supply for the U.S. Navy. But in recent decades, scientists and Indigenous communities have highlighted the cultural and ecological importance of the region. Coastal lagoons that shelter whales and walruses abut Arctic tundra home to polar bear and caribou populations. These ecosystems sustain the subsistence hunting and fishing that many Indigenous communities have relied on for generations.

The permafrost blanketing the reserve is also one of the world’s largest carbon stores. Oil development not only produces direct emissions from drilling in the ice, but can accelerate permafrost thaw, potentially releasing vast amounts of ancient carbon long locked in frozen tundra. Scientists warn that once released, that carbon cannot easily be recaptured.

The Biden administration in its approach to the reserve framed the areas as a globally significant climate refuge where oil and gas development needed to be tightly constrained. Tuesday’s vote is the latest signal that federal policy has shifted sharply away from those conservation principles and toward a landscape increasingly shaped by fossil fuel projects.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-1487928387-1024x674.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 05:59:34.619190

s the COP30 climate conference wraps up in Brazil's Amazonian hub of Belém, activists are dispersing after two weeks of rainforest photo ops, protest disruptions and impassioned speeches on slashing carbon emissions. But participants sidestepped the stark reality: The actions of Western nations hold diminishing sway over the trajectory of global warming.

For decades now, Western governments, especially in Europe, prioritized carbon cuts over higher economic growth, spending trillions of dollars to convince consumers to adopt electric cars and accept more expensive, less reliable wind and solar power. All these expensive efforts are barely making a dent.

The global decarbonization rate, measured as carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions over GDP, has remained roughly constant since the 1960s, with no change after the 2015 Paris Agreement. Global emissions have skyrocketed, reaching a new record high in 2024. Despite this, climate campaigners are unrealistically demanding that the world quadruple its decarbonization rate.

Why are emissions still increasing when the European Union and the United States spent more than US$700 billion in 2024 on green investments like solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, hydrogen, electric cars and power grids? Because rich world emissions matter very little for climate change in the 21st century.

While the West dominated emissions in previous centuries, the vast amount of future emissions will come from China, India, Africa, Brazil, Indonesia and many other countries clambering out of poverty. One recent scenario shows that with current policies, just 13 percent of CO2 emissions over the rest of this century will come from the mostly rich, Western countries of the OECD.

The West’s pledge of achieving net zero by 2050 will cost hundreds of trillions of dollars and do little. Most likely, the policy will simply shift more energy-intensive production to the rest of the world with little overall impact on emissions, just as we have seen electric car battery manufacturing shift to China’s coal-powered economy.

If rich countries try to fix this problem with carbon border taxes, the costs will escalate further for both rich and poor countries while robbing the poor of the opportunity for export-driven growth.",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2025/11/16/2025_11_16_169043_1763253536._large.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 06:58:15.167591

The ability to secure diverse, sustainable, and ethically sourced battery metals will be a defining factor in which nations and companies lead the 21st-century economy.","The global economy is undergoing a profound transformation, driven by an unprecedented surge in demand for electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy storage. At the heart of this revolution lie critical battery metals—lithium, cobalt, and nickel—whose strategic importance has skyrocketed, igniting a new ""gold rush"" that is reshaping global supply chains, geopolitical alliances, and the future of industrial development. This renewed focus on securing these vital resources comes with immediate implications for market stability, technological innovation, and national security, as the world races to electrify its future.

The immediate implications are multifaceted: intense strain on existing supply chains, significant price volatility for these commodities, and a heightened geopolitical competition for control over their extraction and processing. While the long-term demand outlook remains robust, the market is navigating a complex period marked by temporary oversupply in some segments, coupled with the immense challenge of scaling up production and refining capacities to meet future exponential growth. This dynamic environment is compelling governments and corporations alike to re-evaluate their strategies, seeking to build more resilient, diversified, and sustainable pathways for these essential materials.

The Electrification Imperative: A Deep Dive into Battery Metal Dynamics

The driving force behind the renewed emphasis on battery metals is the explosive growth of the electric vehicle market and the broader energy transition. Global EV sales surged by 25% in 2024, reaching 17 million units, and are projected to account for 22.6% of total light-vehicle sales worldwide by 2025, climbing to nearly 70% by 2035. This exponential growth directly translates into an insatiable demand for lithium-ion batteries, which in turn necessitates vast quantities of lithium, cobalt, and nickel. A typical EV, for instance, requires approximately eight kilograms of lithium, dwarfing the needs of consumer electronics.

This demand surge has unfolded over a critical timeline:

Mid-2010s Onwards: China aggressively invested across the entire battery supply chain, rapidly expanding its battery production capabilities and raw material supply chains, establishing a dominant position.

2020-2022: Price Surges and Supply Shocks: The COVID-19 pandemic exposed supply chain vulnerabilities, leading to global lithium prices surging over 500% from 2021 to 2022. Nickel prices spiked by 250% in early 2022, exacerbated by geopolitical tensions, notably the Russia-Ukraine war.

2022 Onwards: Policy Interventions: Western governments responded with significant policy initiatives. The US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 introduced tax credits for EVs with batteries sourced from domestic or free-trade partners, while the European Critical Raw Materials Act aims to foster domestic production.

2023-2024: Market Stabilization and Short-Term Oversupply: A period of oversupply and slower-than-expected EV demand growth in some regions led to significant price declines for lithium and nickel. However, some prices have shown signs of rebounding in early 2025, with forecasts of a substantial lithium recovery by 2026.

Key players across the battery metal supply chain include:

Miners: Australia (48% of lithium extraction), Chile (31%), and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC, 70% of cobalt production) dominate raw material extraction. Notable public companies include Albemarle (NYSE: ALB), SQM (NYSE: SQM), BHP Group Limited (NYSE: BHP), and Rio Tinto Group (NYSE: RIO).

Refiners and Processors: China holds an overwhelming dominance, controlling over half of global lithium, cobalt, and graphite refining capabilities, and 70% of global battery manufacturing capacity.

EV Manufacturers and Battery Cell Producers: Leading battery manufacturers include Chinese giants Contemporary Amperex Technology Company Limited (CATL) (SHE: 300750) and BYD (OTCPK: BYDDF), alongside South Korean (e.g., LG Chem (KRX: 051910), Samsung SDI (KRX: 006400)) and Japanese (e.g., Panasonic (OTCPK: PCRFY)) producers. Major EV manufacturers like Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Mercedes-Benz Group AG (OTCPK: MBGAF) are actively securing supplies.

Initial market reactions have been characterized by extreme price volatility, a surge in investment and M&A activity to secure resources, and a clear prioritization of battery metals as national security interests by governments worldwide. The supply chain remains highly vulnerable due to geographic concentration, geopolitical instability, long lead times for new projects, and persistent environmental, social, and governance (ESG) concerns, particularly in regions like the DRC. Efforts to secure resources include diversification of sourcing, domestic production incentives, direct offtake agreements, strategic stockpiling, and significant investment in recycling and alternative battery chemistries.

Winners and Losers in the Battery Metal Race

The volatile yet high-growth environment for battery metals presents a mixed bag for public companies, creating distinct winners and losers across the mining, EV manufacturing, and battery production sectors.

Mining Companies:

Potential Winners: Miners with low-cost operations, diversified portfolios, and long-term supply agreements are best positioned. Albemarle (NYSE: ALB), the world's largest lithium company, benefits from its scale and strategic contracts, aiming to triple its production by 2030. SQM (NYSE: SQM), the second-largest, recently reported a rebound in profits driven by strong lithium demand. Diversified giants like BHP Group Limited (NYSE: BHP) and Rio Tinto Group (NYSE: RIO) are pivoting towards renewable-focused metals, including nickel and lithium, strengthening their long-term prospects.

Potential Losers: Many producers, particularly those with higher operating costs or significant exposure to the recent price downturn, have faced substantial financial pressure. Australian nickel producers, for instance, have ceased operations due to fierce competition, particularly from Indonesian supply. Companies like Tianqi Lithium (SHE: 002466) issued profit warnings in early 2024 due to falling lithium prices. The recent market oversupply has forced unprofitable miners to implement drastic cost-cutting measures and delay or cancel projects, impacting future supply growth.

EV Manufacturers:

Potential Winners: EV manufacturers generally benefit from the increased availability and, critically, the recent lower prices of battery metals, which reduce their production costs. This allows them to either improve profit margins or lower vehicle prices, boosting competitiveness and sales. Companies like Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE: TM), and Mercedes-Benz Group AG (OTCPK: MBGAF) are actively working to stabilize their supply chains through direct investments and long-term agreements. They are also investing in battery chemistry innovations, such as lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries, to reduce reliance on more expensive or ethically contentious metals.

Potential Losers: While lower prices are currently advantageous, EV makers who fail to secure diverse and sustainable long-term raw material sources risk future supply bottlenecks and competitive disadvantages when demand eventually outstrips current supply. Over-reliance on specific metals from geopolitically unstable regions (e.g., cobalt from the DRC) can lead to reputational damage and supply restrictions.

Battery Producers:

Potential Winners: Major battery producers like Contemporary Amperex Technology Company Limited (CATL) (SHE: 300750), LG Energy Solution (KRX: 373220), Panasonic (OTCPK: PCRFY), and Samsung SDI (KRX: 006400) are in a strong position as lower metal costs translate to reduced production expenses. This facilitates the rapid scale-up of ""gigafactories"" to meet projected demand. Companies like FREYR Battery, Inc. (NYSE: FREY) are actively advancing efforts to stabilize the supply chain. These producers are also diversifying battery chemistries, with a clear trend towards LFP batteries, which use less nickel and no cobalt, to balance performance and cost.

Potential Losers: Battery producers can suffer if they fail to manage raw material procurement effectively or are slow to adapt to new battery chemistries or recycling technologies. For instance, POSCO (NYSE: PKX) delayed the completion of its lithium brine project in Argentina until 2026, indicating strategic adjustments due to market volatility. Regulatory changes, such as new EU rules classifying ""black mass"" (recycled battery material) as ""waste,"" can also squeeze margins by restricting exports to non-OECD countries, including China.

Wider Significance: A Geopolitical and Environmental Crossroads

The renewed focus on battery metals transcends mere market dynamics, embedding itself deeply within broader industry trends, geopolitical strategies, and environmental considerations. It signifies a pivotal moment in the global green transition and a new era of resource competition.

This scramble for critical minerals is intrinsically linked to the green transition, as EVs and renewable energy storage are foundational to achieving net-zero emissions. Projections indicate lithium demand could jump by 2,909% with 40% EV adoption by 2050. This reliance on minerals for climate goals has elevated energy security and technological leadership to national priorities. Simultaneously, it fuels intense geopolitical competition. China's commanding position in the processing and refining of critical minerals (e.g., 95% of refined graphite by 2030, 73% of lithium, 59% of cobalt) creates vulnerabilities for Western nations. This dominance is driving market fragmentation and the emergence of parallel supply chains, as countries like the US and EU seek to reduce reliance on concentrated sources and build strategic autonomy.

Ripple effects are widespread. For competitors, navigating fragmented supply chains and volatile prices challenges cost competitiveness and can slow EV adoption. For partners, resource-rich nations (Australia, Chile, DRC, Indonesia, Canada) gain significant leverage, demanding more equitable terms for investment and promoting sustainable development. This fosters new alliances and trade agreements, with automakers increasingly partnering directly with miners to secure long-term supplies.

Regulatory and policy implications are profound:

Subsidies and Incentives: Governments, particularly in the US (Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Inflation Reduction Act, Defense Production Act) and Europe (Critical Raw Materials Act), are pouring billions into domestic critical mineral production, processing, and recycling to de-risk supply chains and foster regional ecosystems.

Environmental Regulations: The extraction of battery metals carries significant environmental and social costs, including water pollution, habitat destruction, and human rights abuses (e.g., child labor in DRC cobalt mines). Policies are emerging to promote sustainable mining practices, enhance transparency, and boost recycling rates. The EU's proposed Battery Regulation, for example, mandates sustainability, end-of-life management, and due diligence obligations for raw material sourcing.

Historically, the current situation draws parallels with past resource booms, exhibiting a ""boom and bust"" cycle characteristic of commodities. However, the scale and strategic nature of the green transition make this distinct. It marks a ""return of state intervention"" in critical mineral supply chains, where national policy frameworks increasingly shape industry activities. The cautionary tale of Zambia's copper mining history, which led to ""sacrifice zones"" with severe environmental degradation, underscores the critical importance of stringent regulations and accountability to prevent repeating past mistakes in the pursuit of battery metals.

What Comes Next: Navigating the Future of Battery Metals

The trajectory of battery metal supply chains and the EV market beyond 2025 will be defined by strategic pivots, technological advancements, and the delicate balance between surging demand and the ability to scale sustainable supply.

In the short-term (up to 2025/2026), the EV market continues its robust expansion, albeit at a more moderate pace than earlier projections. While prices for lithium, graphite, cobalt, and nickel declined in 2023-2024 due to temporary oversupply and inventory adjustments, some metals are showing signs of recovery. Nickel prices have rebounded due to Indonesian export restrictions, and lithium prices are anticipated to recover substantially by 2026, potentially reaching $12,000-$17,000 per tonne. Opportunities lie in the continued EV growth and the strategic pivot by battery manufacturers towards large-scale energy storage systems (ESS) to utilize underused factories. Challenges persist with geopolitical tensions and ongoing price volatility.

The long-term outlook (beyond 2026) is characterized by substantial growth. By 2040, EVs are expected to account for 70% of all new passenger car registrations. Demand for lithium is projected to increase fivefold by 2040, nickel sixfold, and cobalt threefold. Key strategic pivots and developments include:

Diversification of Battery Chemistries: The market is consolidating around Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) and Lithium Nickel Manganese Cobalt Oxide (NMC) chemistries. LFP, with its lower cost and absence of cobalt/nickel, is gaining significant traction.

Advanced Battery Technologies: Solid-state batteries are seen as the ""new gold standard,"" promising longer ranges and improved safety. Sodium-ion batteries represent a potential long-term game-changer, as they eliminate the need for lithium, nickel, cobalt, and manganese by substituting abundant sodium, fundamentally altering the resource landscape.

Battery Recycling and Circular Economy: Recycling is becoming critical for long-term supply security and environmental sustainability. By 2030, recycling is projected to supply 15% of the nickel, cobalt, and lithium required for new batteries, creating a secure, domestic supply stream.

Vertical Integration and Supply Chain Reshoring: Companies are increasingly investing directly in raw material extraction and refining, and governments are pushing to build domestic and diversified supply chains to reduce reliance on single regions.

Investment in Production Capacity: Despite sufficient geological reserves, the primary challenge is insufficient current extraction and refining capacity. An estimated $500-600 billion in investment globally through 2040 is required for new mining and refining infrastructure.

Potential scenarios for resource availability and pricing range from worst-case scenarios of severe supply crunches and price spikes (due to insufficient investment or geopolitical disruptions), hindering EV adoption, to best-case scenarios of balanced supply and demand through successful scaling of new projects, efficient refining, and significant contributions from recycling. Technological breakthroughs in new battery chemistries could also diversify the resource base and mitigate supply risks. While overall reserves are sufficient, the bottleneck remains in the speed and sustainability of extraction and processing. Prices are expected to remain volatile but will likely experience upward pressure in the long term if supply and recycling efforts do not keep pace with demand.

Wrap-Up: Investing in the Future of Electrification

The renewed focus on battery metals is not merely a fleeting market trend but a foundational shift underpinning the global clean energy transition. Its significance and lasting impact will be felt across economies, geopolitics, and environmental stewardship for decades to come.

Key Takeaways:

Decarbonization Imperative: Battery metals are indispensable for achieving global decarbonization goals, powering EVs and energy storage.

Strategic Assets: These minerals are now viewed as strategic national assets, driving intense geopolitical competition for supply chain control.

Vulnerable Supply Chains: Geographic concentration in mining and processing creates significant vulnerabilities to disruptions.

Innovation & Diversification: Technological advancements in battery chemistry and a concerted effort towards supply chain diversification and recycling are crucial for resilience.

Market Moving Forward: The battery metals market is set for robust growth, with the lithium-ion battery market alone projected to exceed $400 billion by 2030. EV adoption, coupled with the booming energy storage market, will continue to drive demand. While recent price volatility has created temporary challenges, the long-term investment thesis remains exceptionally strong, with analysts anticipating a market rebalancing and potential deficits for some metals by the end of the decade.

Final Thoughts: The ""electrification thematic,"" driven by decarbonization, national security, and technological advancements, ensures sustained demand for battery metals. The journey will be marked by continued volatility, innovation, and strategic realignments. The ability to secure diverse, sustainable, and ethically sourced battery metals will be a defining factor in which nations and companies lead the 21st-century economy.

What Investors Should Watch For in Coming Months:

Geopolitical Developments: Monitor trade policies, export restrictions (especially from China), and new international partnerships aimed at securing critical mineral supply chains. Government support and incentives (e.g., IRA) will continue to shape investment.

Technological Shifts: Keep an eye on the adoption rates of LFP batteries and the progress of advanced technologies like solid-state and sodium-ion batteries, which could alter demand for specific metals.

Recycling Infrastructure: Track investments and advancements in battery recycling, as this will become a critical source of secondary supply.

Processing Capacity: The development of new processing and refining facilities outside of China is a key indicator of supply chain diversification.

ESG Concerns: Increasingly stringent ESG standards will influence investment decisions and operational practices in the mining sector.

Lithium: Watch for signs of market rebalancing, potential restocking, and the ramp-up of new projects outside concentrated regions.

Cobalt: Monitor the interplay of oversupply from the DRC and Indonesia with demand for premium battery applications and continued efforts towards ethical sourcing and alternatives.

Nickel: Pay attention to the shift from market surplus to deficit, sustained demand for high-purity (Class 1) nickel, and any evolving scrutiny over the environmental impact of Indonesian production.

As part of the deal, Eos is allowed to issue $500 million in notes that investors can convert into stock.

The Department of Energy has the right to buy the shares at a penny apiece within the next five years, according to financial disclosures from Eos. The agreement is automatically executed if the stock price exceeds $30 after a year, with some stipulations.

Eos shares were trading at $12.75 on the Nasdaq stock exchange as of market close Wednesday, down 5% on the day, but still up 131% since the start of the year.

If the government bought the stock at that price, its holdings in the company would be worth more than $7 million. With about 288 million outstanding shares, Eos is offering the Department of Energy far less than 1% of the company.

As part of the deal, Eos is allowed to issue $500 million in notes that investors can convert into stock. The proceeds will go toward buying back past versions of these notes and “general corporate purposes,” according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings.

The agreement is the result of the Department of Energy modifying a $305 million loan to Eos, according to a spokesperson for the agency.

That loan agreement, entered into in November, is going toward expanding the firm’s main plant in Turtle Creek.

“As part of the Trump administration’s review of the loan portfolio, both parties worked together to enhance the deal,” according to the Energy Department.

”Eos was given the ability to pursue advantageous private market capital as its business grows rapidly, while DOE will gain the ability to share in some of this potential upside through equity value in warrants that eventually can be converted into additional return for the U.S. government.”

Eos did not respond Wednesday to requests for comment.

The firm produces industrial-scale, rechargeable batteries that rely on reactions between zinc and bromine, which the Energy Department touted in a release during the waning days of the Biden administration as valuable for storing excess clean energy.

They’re also used to fuel data centers, perhaps shedding light on why the artificial intelligence-friendly Trump administration remains supportive of Eos, despite its ties to renewables.

President Donald Trump has shown a fondness for these types of deals, with the federal government under his watch taking stakes of 15% in rare earth minerals producer MP Materials and 10% in computer chip maker Intel.

Westinghouse has also entered a profit-sharing deal with the government from the sale of nuclear reactors.

Pennsylvania and Allegheny County economic development agencies got in on the action with Eos last month by pledging a combined $24 million toward growing its operations in Turtle Creek as well as Marshall.

The Turtle Creek facility employs 280 people, a number that will roughly quadruple over the next year or so, according to Eos CEO Joe Mastrangelo. Corporate operations shifting from Edison, New Jersey, to Nova Place in Pittsburgh’s North Shore in the back half of 2026 will bring additional jobs.

Flush with public dollars, the 17-year-old company has finally found itself able to generate substantial revenue. In the third quarter of this year, Eos’ revenues neared $31 million, up from less than $1 million during the same quarter in 2024.

It took a net loss, however, of about $641 million.",https://assets-varnish.triblive.com/2025/11/9060689_web1_ptr-EOSexpansion006-102225.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 04:59:01.009767

While local production for renewable energy is growing, manufacturers face competition from Asian powerhouses, led by China, that dominate the global solar supply chain with cheaper, mass-produced panels.","BELEM, Brazil, Nov. 19 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) – The message could not have been clearer as protesters carried coffins labeled oil, coal and gas through Belém while negotiators met in the Amazonian city for the United Nations COP30 climate summit.

It may be too early to declare the end of the fossil fuel era, but up to 80 countries are demanding a concrete plan to move away from polluting power at the climate summit.

Along with the political challenge of getting the 195 countries, including oil producers, at COP30 to agree to such a plan, there are practical obstacles to weaning the world off oil and gas, especially as electricity demand is set to soar from the surge in artificial intelligence and population growth.

Although renewable power is expanding fast, the world is not on track to triple clean energy by 2030, a target set at COP28 in Dubai two years ago, when countries agreed for the first time on “transitioning away from fossil fuels.”

And the expansion is not happening quickly enough in the countries that need clean power most.

Developing nations say they require more money to switch to clean power and join the “unstoppable” renewables revolution that could create 8,000 jobs a day over the next decade, said Bruce Douglas, chief executive of the Brussels-based Global Renewables Alliance.

“The gap is getting smaller, (but) we need a significant increase in investment and deployment…. The targets are great, but targets are not turbines and pledges are not panels,” Douglas said in an interview at COP30.

Governments need to put in place ambitious climate plans to give investors confidence in projects that would provide energy-poor citizens with power and cut mortality rates from air pollution caused by burning fossil fuels, Douglas said.

“Capital is flowing in record amounts year-on-year, but it’s not happening in those markets that need it most,” Douglas said.

Only about 17% of investment in clean energy goes to developing and emerging economies, he said, with that number falling to about 4% in Africa, where some 620 million people lack stable and affordable access to energy.

Urielle Nsenda, a negotiator for the Democratic Republic of Congo, said developing countries like hers also need technical support to design renewable projects.

“Another problem facing countries in Africa is that we don’t have enough data on the sector to help us identify and build suitable projects for national circumstances,” she said in Belém.

For example, the DRC has significant hydropower energy potential, according to the International Energy Agency, while other African countries are focusing on solar power to boost their renewable capacity.

“The energy transition requires us to adapt our infrastructure,” Nsenda said. “We don’t want to carry the burden alone.”

PRICED OUT

Douglas said finance from richer governments can be used to provide subsidies to communities to invest in solar, and larger-scale projects often require measures to reduce the risk of financial losses and bring down the cost of investments.

“In many cases the perceived risk is higher than the actual risk, so default rates for some of those countries are lower than they are using to price the interest rates,” he said.

Douglas also called for an end to more than $1 trillion of fossil fuel subsidies worldwide and policies to ensure this does not penalize the most vulnerable by exposing them to higher electricity bills.

“So you build the renewables at the same time as you are transitioning away from fossil fuels,” he said.

A draft of a possible deal for the COP30 talks, drawn up by host Brazil, contains a line urging all parties to phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies.

Developing countries that produce gas, oil and coal are concerned about the effect of the transition on workers and industries as well as on consumers who might face higher costs.

After Nigeria abolished fuel subsidies as part of a package of economic reforms in 2023, petrol prices tripled, driving nationwide protests last year.

Nigeria aims to reduce its dependence on oil and generate 30% of its energy from renewables by 2030 as well as develop local manufacturing capacity.

While local production for renewable energy is growing, manufacturers face competition from Asian powerhouses, led by China, that dominate the global solar supply chain with cheaper, mass-produced panels.

“The developed world must phase out their reliance on fossil fuels fast, while allowing developing countries a longer timeline and the necessary support, like technology and financing, to do the same,” Prince Papa, Africa campaigner for the global Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative (FFNPTI), said ahead of the COP30 talks.

One stumbling block on the path to a global clean energy transition is the stance of U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration, which has blocked renewable projects at home and is pushing other countries to follow suit.

“There are going to be winners and losers, and the losers may well be those consumers in the United States who could face increased power prices, especially given increased demand from data centers and AI,” he said.

The House also passed H.J.","The Senate already passed one of the resolutions and is moving to take up another.

The House on Tuesday voted to overturn a slew of Biden administration land protections through the rule-busting Congressional Review Act.

The House passed S.J. Res. 80 from Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) to ax former President Joe Biden's decision to withdraw millions of acres from production in Alaska's National Petroleum Reserve.

Three moderate Democrats — Jim Costa of California, Henry Cuellar of Texas and Vicente Gonzalez of Texas — crossed the aisle to vote ""yes.""

The legislation passed the Senate last month with support from Pennsylvania Democrat John Fetterman and now heads to President Donald Trump.

House Natural Resources Chair Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.) said the measure was critical to Alaska’s economic success and in line with congressional intent.

“The Biden administration stymied energy production in the NPR-A and failed to offer leases in a manner that that would boost revenue and provide economic stability to the region and the state,” Westerman said.

Arguing against the resolution was House Natural Resources ranking member Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), who warned that the Republicans’ CRA strategy was both unnecessary and legally dubious.

""House Republicans are continuing to lock the American people into higher energy costs by pushing their fossil fuel playbook and sabotaging clean, renewable energy,"" Huffman said. ""Our constituents deserve better.""

The Congressional Review Act allows lawmakers to undo newly issued rules by simple majority. Because the last administration did not submit a number of resource plans as rules, it kept them vulnerable to attack from the GOP.

The House also passed H.J. Res. 131, from Rep. Nick Begich (R-Alaska), to repeal the Biden administration’s restrictions in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

“Congress must move to repeal the Biden-era [Record of Decision] that runs counter to congressional intent and unfairly reduces economic opportunities in the region,” Westerman said.

Huffman called the measure the ""latest attack from my Republican colleagues to undercut our public lands, to prop up fossil fuel polluters and the expensive energy sources that they peddle and to leave people out of the decision-making process.”

The same three Democrats voted for the proposal. Pennsylvania Republican Brian Fitzpatrick, who often bucks his party on the environment, voted to keep Biden development limits in Alaska.

Rep. Harriet Hageman's H.J. Res. 130 would strike the Bureau of Land Management Buffalo Field Office's latest resource management plan, which sought to severely restrict coal leasing. No Democrat voted in favor. The Senate is poised to approve the legislation this week.

Congress already killed Biden-era resource management plans in Montana, North Dakota and Alaska. The administration is moving to undo other Biden actions on its own.

We’ve just about made it through another hurricane season. But I should warn you that something even scarier is coming: A gubernatorial election.

Board up your windows! Batten down your lawn furniture! The politicians are coming, and they’re blowing Category 5 gusts of hot air!

In 2026, we’re going to elect our next governor, and candidates have been jumping into the race like kids leaping into a cool Florida spring on a scorching summer day. So far, there are four Republicans and two Democrats vying for the job.

The Republicans are Byron Donalds, a U.S. representative from Naples; Paul Renner, a former speaker of the House from the Jacksonville area; little-known Lt. Gov. Jay Collins from Tampa; and James Fishback, a business executive with no government experience whom Politico described as a “fast-talking, Spanish-speaking Davie, Florida, native.”

On the Democratic side, the competitors are former Pinellas County Republican U.S. Rep. David Jolly, now pursuing the Charlie Crist party-switch path; and Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings, a former police chief and sheriff.

As if those six weren’t enough, there’s an independent candidate, Miami Sen. Jason Pizzo, a former Democrat who’s announced he’s running, too.

Generally speaking, seeing seven candidates seeking the Governor’s Mansion could be a sign of how big a disaster the sitting occupant has been.

The Ron DeSantis administration is being investigated by a Leon County grand jury in the Hope Florida scandal. He’s under scrutiny for voting to give $83 million to a campaign contributor in exchange for 4 acres of Destin land nobody wanted. His proposal to build golf courses in a state park last year was so deeply unpopular that the Legislature passed a law this year to prevent him or his successors from ever trying to do it again.

Note that two of the three episodes involve DeSantis’ horrible handling of environmental issues. That’s why, I think, every chance we get in the next 12 months, we voters ought to quiz his would-be replacements about where they stand on that segment of the state’s responsibilities.

As we have seen repeatedly, the environment in Florida IS the economy. The two are as inextricably intertwined as the tangled roots of a mangrove forest.

Dirty water

When DeSantis was first elected in 2018, Florida voters were concerned about toxic algae blooms that had lasted for months. DeSantis swore he’d cure this by appointing a panel of scientists to tell him about what to do.

He appointed the panel — but then he and the Legislature failed to follow most of its recommendations.

Now Florida is the No. 1 state for polluted lakes. A toxic algae bloom killed off so much seagrass in the Indian River Lagoon that more than 1,000 manatees starved to death. Florida’s longest river, the St. Johns, is coping with steadily increasing pollution from septic waste.

Even when the Legislature passed a law ordering special protections for our iconic springs, the agencies answering to DeSantis ignored it, noted Grant Gelhardt of the Sierra Club.

Instead of attacking pollution sources, DeSantis cut a deal to pay millions of dollars to an Israeli company that dumps a hydrogen peroxide mix into algae-tainted waterways. But then the algae comes back and the Israelis have to do it over. Even the head of the Israeli company thinks this is futile.

“DeSantis’ fight against algal blooms in Florida will fail,” he wrote on X, back when it was just plain Twitter. “There is no question that preventing raw sewage and runoffs from spilling into waterways must be addressed.”

So, the first question everyone should ask the gubernatorial candidates is: What will you do to fix Florida’s rampant water pollution problems?

Lake O woes

I had a lengthy chat about this with Gil Smart of the Vote Water organization, who pointed out that Lake Okeechobee in particular needs help.

It was recently named the dirtiest lake in the U.S. Things have gotten so bad there that Bass Masters removed Lake O from its Top Ten Bass Lakes in the United States.

Rather than clamp down on polluters poisoning Lake O and other waterways, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection has set up a series of voluntary “basin management action plans” that all fail, Smart said.

“That’s the state’s main tool for reducing pollution and it’s not working,” he said. “At what point do we stop saying, ‘Oh, that’s a shame,’ and start doing something about it?”

The polluters tend to be big campaign contributors, which guarantees they’re left alone. But the pollution is taking an economic toll on our tourism, fishing, and other industries, so whoever takes over from DeSantis will need to make some hard choices.

Last year, Donalds convened a water summit that matched polluters with regulators — and refused to allow in either the press or the public. If he opened the meeting to everyone, Donalds argued, the poor polluters and the people regulating them would be too scared to talk honestly.

To me, “honest talk” between polluters and regulators is less important than letting the public — the people paying the tax bills and drinking the water —- know what’s going on.

But that leads to our second question for the candidates.

On the downlow

DeSantis clearly missed his calling. Instead of politics, he should’ve gone into espionage.

He persuaded the Legislature to make his travel records a state secret, even though no governor ever sought such a Sunshine Law exemption. He held a Cabinet meeting in a foreign country, ensuring most Floridians couldn’t participate. Even worse, he’s repeatedly cut non-public deals to give away public land to private interests.

First came his attempt to allow a company to build three golf courses in Jonathan Dickinson State Park, plus hotels and pickleball courts in other parks. That blew up in his face like a hand grenade.

Then he attempted to swap land from the Withlacoochee State Forest with a Canadian golf course builder. An uproar ensued and the land went unswapped.

More recently, he wanted to give some mystery developer 600 acres from the Guana River Wildlife Management Area. Once the public found out, the developer melted back into the shadows.

Each instance of DeSantis trying to keep things on the downlow led to widespread outrage. People love Florida’s preserves, and they don’t like seeing some ploy to give them away.

That’s why I think the next question for the candidates has to be: Will you treat public land like it’s owned by the public, and not as your personal property to benefit friends?

We want to return to the days when our precious state parks, preserves,, and forests stayed public and stayed natural.

This leads to the one area where DeSantis almost came across as a good guy.

Undermining the Everglades

For 25 years, when Florida politicians wanted to fool the voters into thinking they liked the environment, they talked about restoring the Everglades.

“I pledge to spend millions on restoration of the River of Grass,” they’d promise solemnly. What they really meant was, “I’ll hand over millions in tax dollars to well-connected contractors to build what the plans call for, but I won’t do it fast and they’ll take their time, too.”

That’s why the Everglades restoration has gone billions over budget and years beyond its original deadline.

But not even the most cynical would have built a new pollution source like an immigrant detention camp in the Big Cypress National Preserve. That would undercut all the restoration work that’s already been done.

Yet DeSantis did it, and without even checking its environmental impact.

Environmental groups accused him of betraying the Glades. But DeSantis scoffed at being considered an Everglades villain, considering all the money he’d steered toward the River of Grass.

“You’re talking about the guy who’s plowed how much money into Everglades restoration?” DeSantis said.

That’s sort of like him saying, “I’ve spent a lot of money on a fancy car, so you should respect my automotive expertise — even though I’ve just dumped a bag of sugar in the gas tank.”

Lawsuits are working their way through federal court to shut this camp down.

I contacted one of the plaintiffs: Eve Samples, executive director of Friends of the Everglades, the organization co-founded by Marjory Stoneman Douglas. I asked her what she would ask the candidates to replace DeSantis. Her answer:

“Will you commit to banning all harmful development from the Everglades that undermines the billion-dollar restoration project?”

That should cover not only the prison camp known as “Alligator Alcatraz,” she said, but also a rock mine being pushed by Big Sugar and various residential and commercial developments that have been steadily chomping away at the margins.

“You can’t be an Everglades governor and allow development in the Everglades,” she said.

Which leads to the next question.

Developer-Santis

DeSantis has never met a developer he didn’t like. He’s signed every bill they supported. He’s backed controversial developments so often, I started calling him “Developer-Santis.”

Did the developers want expensive toll roads to spread urban sprawl throughout rural areas? Despite widespread objections, DeSantis said yes to that.

Even when a project would make hurricane evacuation much worse, he didn’t support saving the lives of Floridians. Instead, he voted to say yes to the developer.

And if any local government failed to kowtow to developers, he’s been eager to force them into compliance.’

The result of putting the developers in the driver’s seat is that growth is careening out of control, leaving our sewer systems overloaded, our water systems running dry and our roads crowded and crumbling.

Lots of Floridians are becoming fed up with this unwavering governmental support of sprawl-over-all. They want a change. That’s especially true in our remaining rural areas, where people like living at a slower pace.

So, the next question I would ask the candidates is: Will you stand up to developers and tell them no? Will you stick up for saving some parts of Florida as rural? Will you commit to keeping these slices of paradise the way they are?

If they do it even once, that’s better than DeSantis.

Last but not least, let’s talk about science.

The anti-scientist

While I was talking to Gerhardt of the Sierra Club, he told me, “Science should be in the forefront of any plan to protect Florida’s resources.” Who could argue with that?

Our governor would. In the future, DeSantis will be remembered as the most virulently anti-science governor ever.

During the pandemic, he became such a contrarian to the medical establishment that he actually scolded teenagers for wearing masks .

He’s also appointed people who were anti-science, like an anti-vaxxer surgeon general. And consider his wildlife commissioners, who are so eager to shoot bears that they ignored that the science shows the bear population has declined.

He was cool with signing a new law based on the thoroughly debunked conspiracy theory about “chemtrails.” Meanwhile, even though signs of climate change are obvious everywhere in Florida, he approved legislation to remove that term from most of state law. He had the full support of Speaker Renner on that one, by the way.

Surprisingly, ignoring climate change does not make it go away. We will continue facing soaring temperatures and rising sea levels that affect everything from the intensity of hurricanes to the frequency of expensive beach renourishment.

So, I think it’s fair to ask the candidates if they believe in following what science says about solutions. Or would they prefer Florida continue relying on folk tales, internet rumors, and ancient superstitions?

I think we need to pin these guys down now. Otherwise, they’re liable to try try to top DeSantis. Look for them to start building a fire circle in front of the Capitol, dancing around and chanting gibberish to placate the angry hurricane god,",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-44/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/st-johns-toxic-algae-bloom-via-st-johns-riverkeeper-11763616648.jpeg?h=1b545bd3&itok=1I4HOEgS,N,,2025-11-20 06:59:09.879762

President Trump has been loudly pushing his vision for U.S. energy dominance, which includes increasing U.S. oil and gas exports. But the Trump EPA is cutting the legs out from under U.S. oil and gas competitiveness in international markets.

I was the senate-confirmed head of enforcement in the Obama EPA and a Senior Advisor in the Biden EPA, deeply involved in the Biden environmental rules for U.S. oil and gas. So I am an unlikely person to be helping the President by sending a warning: EPA is putting your energy dominance agenda at risk. This is the moment to intervene because EPA action is expected any day.

The engine for U.S. sales of oil and gas overseas is the strength of U.S. rules that position U.S. oil and gas to become the cleanest in the world. A growing number of countries want to buy oil and gas that has cut avoidable emissions and can prove it. The EU has methane restrictions on the books, and many other large fuel-purchasing countries are teed up to follow suit.

Importing countries want oil and gas that hit three key benchmarks: reduced emissions from production and distribution, a robust system to curtail super-emitters – which are responsible for as much as 50% of emissions – and reliable monitoring and reporting so emission claims can be verified. That’s what EU rules require, and what other big importing countries are quickly moving toward.

Fortunately for U.S. oil and gas companies, the U.S. already has such a program. It’s set forth in the 2024 methane rule and in EPA’s reporting program. While the motivation of the U.S. rules wasn’t primarily to promote exports, that’s their effect, because they address the requirements of importing countries, backed by the credibility of U.S. government oversight.

The driver for U.S. oil and gas supremacy is already built; all the Trump EPA has to do is get out of the way.

Despite these rules’ alignment with the President’s energy dominance agenda, EPA plans to delay both, one for as long as a decade. EPA Administrator Zeldin claims that gutting these rules is good for the U.S. oil and gas industry. That is exactly wrong. These rules are what positions U.S. oil and gas producers to be the strongest competitors in the world.

Industry experts concur. An S&P Global analysis finding that growth of LNG exports is expected to add $1.3 trillion to the U.S. economy through 2040 states: “Continued focus on methane reduction throughout the U.S. LNG supply chain will be critical to maintaining a competitive advantage for U.S. LNG in markets that have implemented or are considering implementing methane caps or carbon tariffs on LNG imports, such as Japan and South Korea.” A University of Texas Center for Energy and Environmental Systems Analysis report is more pointed: “Data transparency enhances competitiveness and market access for U.S. oil and gas exports. Substantially weakening emissions data collection would harm rather than help U.S. companies.”

EPA told the EU in 2024 that U.S. oil and gas exports should qualify for an equivalence determination under the EU requirements, exempting U.S. products from most import requirements. The flip side is also true: without the 2024 U.S. rules, an equivalence determination cannot be justified. This difference is night and day for U.S. exporters. An exemption will catapult U.S. oil and gas to the top of the most-desired list. Whereas the EPA proposal to stop reporting “completely shoots a hole” in the request for equivalence.

Industry explained all of this to EPA before it proposed to set aside the rules that give U.S. industry a huge advantage over foreign competitors. Industry leaders don’t want these roll-backs because they can count; the rules’ modest compliance costs are a drop in the bucket compared to hundreds of billions in revenues from exports.

President Trump can get what he wants for U.S. oil and gas exports. Administrator Zeldin just has to leave the reporting rule alone and reactivate the delayed methane rule. With those two rules in place, the U.S. could satisfy the importing countries’ requirements and become the world’s most attractive trading partner.

If that doesn’t happen, and EPA continues to throw a wrench in the works for U.S. energy dominance – likely reducing, rather than boosting, U.S. exports – then the White House can’t say they weren’t warned.

(AP) — The Trump administration has once again extended the life of a Michigan coal-fired power plant that was supposed to close last May as the utility Consumers Energy transitions to cleaner sources of electricity.

The U.S. Energy Department says there are “emergency conditions” that require the J.H. Campbell power plant to remain open to meet electrical demand in the central U.S. Otherwise, the government warned Tuesday, homes and businesses might go dark.

Critics scoff at that claim, and environmental groups and Michigan's attorney general have gone to court to try to overturn orders keeping the plant online.

“The costs of unnecessarily running this jalopy coal plant just continue to mount,” Earthjustice lawyer Michael Lenoff said.

The Campbell plant opened in 1962 near Lake Michigan in western Michigan’s Ottawa County. It can generate up to 1,450 megawatts of electricity to serve up to 1 million people.

Consumers Energy planned to close it May 31, but the Energy Department ordered it to stay open for three months, citing a need for reliable electricity during the hot summer.

That decision has since been extended twice, and the latest order lasts until Feb. 17.

Consumers Energy acknowledged Wednesday that it will continue operating the plant. The net expense through September was pegged at $80 million, which will be shared by customers who are part of a multistate electric grid, the utility said in a securities filing in October.

The U.S. Department of Energy argues parts of the Midwest are facing an energy emergency, and that the J.H. Campbell coal-fired plant’s power would help keep costs low.

Consumers Energy, which operates the plant, had planned to shut it down in May — an early decommissioning the company said was aimed at reducing costs for customers, lowering greenhouse gas emissions, and moving toward natural gas and renewable energy sources.

In a press release, Energy Secretary Chris Wright alleged work taken to shut down coal-burning plants in favor of natural gas and renewable power created an energy shortage.

“The Trump administration will keep taking action to reverse these energy subtraction policies, lowering energy costs and minimizing the risks of blackouts. Americans deserve access to affordable, reliable and secure energy regardless of whether the wind is blowing or the sun is shining, especially in dangerously cold weather,” Wright said in the statement.

This is now the third time Wright ordered the Campbell plant to stay open.

The last two orders also claimed emergency conditions required the plant to stay open. The most recent one would have expired on Wednesday.

Environmental groups and Michigan's state utility regulator have pushed back against the Trump administration’s reasoning to keep the plant open longer.

Michigan League of Conservation Voters spokesperson Nick Dodge said Campbell’s closure doesn’t create any emergency.

“It’s unnecessary, and there have already been plans and additional generation put in place through renewables and in natural gas to fulfill all the energy needs that Campbell provides,” Dodge said.

He also raised concerns about threats to the environment along the Lake Michigan shoreline where the coal-burning plant sits. Regarding the reasoning that Wednesday’s order was a cost-saving measure, Dodge said it would have been cheaper to let the plant close.

“It was supposed to save us $600 million … through 2040. And that was due to the plant being so inefficient and expensive to operate. So, all of that is out the window now with the plant being forced to stay open,” Dodge said.

Consumers Energy, Michigan’s second-largest utility, announced plans to close the Campbell plant back in 2021. The Michigan Public Service Commission approved the plan in 2022.

A webpage detailing steps in the closure said it would make Consumers, “a cleaner, leaner and flexible energy company.”

Company spokesperson Katie Carey provided the following statement responding to Thursday’s order to keep the plant open.

“Consumers Energy is prepared to continue operating the Campbell plant as required by the U.S. Department of Energy. Consistent with a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) order, the costs to operate the Campbell plant will be shared by customers across the Midwest electric grid region – not solely by Consumers Energy customers. We are planning to submit a cost recovery filing to FERC later this year outlining net costs to operate the plant during the first 90 days.”

Michigan shares a power grid with all or part of 14 other states and one Canadian province. The Midcontinent Independent System Operator Inc., or MISO, oversees that regional system.

In a written statement, MISO said it will work with Consumers Energy to ensure order compliance.

“MISO remains focused on reliably operating the grid using the resources our members provide, while working closely with stakeholders and regulatory partners,” the statement from MISO media relations advisor McKenzie Barbknecht read.

The Environmental Protection Agency and Department of the Army’s proposed changes have heightened worry among conservation groups that federal protections for isolated wetlands might be weakened further than they were soon after the 2023 Supreme Court decision that found wetlands must be connected by surface water to a navigable body of water to fall under the 1972 Clean Water Act.

The EPA and Army Corps of Engineers said in a release Monday that the newly proposed changes are to “fully implement the court’s direction by focusing on relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing bodies of water—such as streams, oceans, rivers, and lakes—and wetlands that are connected and indistinguishable from such waterbodies.”

As part of the announcement, leadership posted the prepublication notice they planned to submit to the Federal Register. Once published there, a 45-day public comment period would open.

Language in the Clean Water Act states that the “term ‘navigable waters’ means the waters of the United States, including the territorial seas.” However, the act doesn’t define what “waters of the United States,” or WOTUS, actually are, leaving the EPA and Corps to determine the geographic scope of the rule.

Over the last five decades, pushback and litigation have forced the two agencies to revise the definition several times.

The current regulatory definition, according to the EPA, was put in place in September 2023 to align with the May 2023 Supreme Court ruling on the Sackett v EPA lawsuit.

The Sacketts filed the lawsuit after the agency ordered the Idaho couple to restore where they had begun backfilling with dirt the section of their property that the EPA considered to be wetlands of a nearby navigable waterbody. The judges sided with the Sacketts that federally protected wetlands must have an obvious connection to waterbodies like streams, oceans, rivers and lakes.

To conform to the Sackett decision, the EPA and Army amended in September 2023 the latest final rule, which had been put in place that January.

EPA Secretary Lee Zeldin and Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works Adam Telle shared with Washington, D.C., lawmakers Monday afternoon an overview of the proposed rules.

“I know that across the country, news of today’s proposal is going to be met with a lot of relief and happiness from farmers, ranchers, other landowners, governments that have been looking for a simple, prescriptive definition that the whole country can operate off of, and would allow individuals to know whether or not there’s a ‘water of the United States’ without having to go hire an attorney or a consultant, having to pay someone to Tell them,” Zeldin said Monday during the announcement livestreamed on the EPA’s YouTube.

The EPA secretary explained that the proposal “includes practical, common-sense revisions that will make a real difference,” and adds definitions for what he called “key terms” such as “’relatively permanent,’ ‘continuous surface connection’ and ‘tributary’ to appropriately limit the scope of what is consistent with” the Sackett case.

“We’re establishing that jurisdictional tributaries must connect to traditional navigable waters, either directly or through other features that provide predictable and consistent flow. We’re adding a new exclusion for groundwater and revising exclusions for certain ditches prior converted cropland and waste treatment systems,” Zeldin continued. “We’re incorporating locally familiar terminology such as wet season to help determine whether a water body qualifies as WOTUS. And we’re strengthening state and tribal decision-making authority by providing clear regulatory guidelines while recognizing their expertise in local land and water resources.”

He explained that the proposed rules were developed based on input from multiple sources, including preproposal recommendations, docket information from nine public listening sessions and consultation comments from states, tribes and local governments.

Telle addressed the audience after Zeldin.

“Since 1972 Americans have struggled to understand what Congress meant when it included the term ‘waters of the United States’ in the Clean Water Act. Did it apply to them? Did it not? The definition of that term has been often abused, sometimes stretched beyond recognition over time, and it’s left Americans uncertain about whether they were complying with the Clean Water Act or not,” he said Monday, adding that “under President Trump’s leadership, the EPA and army Civil Works, which oversees the Corps of Engineers, are kicking off the formal process that will give American certainty about their property once and for all.”

Several Republican officials thanked Zeldin from the podium for initiating the proposed amendments including West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey who said that “for too long there’s been great deal of uncertainty” about the WOTUS rule.

“Unfortunately, it left many people holding the bag. Farmers, contractors, small business owners guessing whether their ephemeral stream or a backyard ditch was going to be classified as a waters of the United States rule and potentially subject them to significant penalties,” he continued.

Alabama Congressman Gary Palmer said he was confident that the rule will prioritize clean water while protecting farmers, ranchers, landowners and businesses alike.

Conservation groups have been vocal about these revisions opening up isolated wetlands to development and degradation since the announcement was made.

“Wetlands are the lifeblood of our coast, and should be held to the highest standards of protection,” North Carolina Coastal Federation Coastal Advocate Kerri Allen explained. “The wetlands most impacted by these proposed rollbacks are the very wetlands that hold water during storms and help protect downstream waters. With the proposed changes, our coast will face irrevocable damage that impacts not only our wildlife and fisheries, but also our coastal economy and communities.” The Coastal Federation publishes Coastal Review.

Southern Environmental Law Center Senior Attorney Mark Sabath said Monday in a statement that this proposed rule, if adopted, “could have catastrophic ramifications for communities already plagued by flooding, water quality concerns, and drinking water shortages. After critical, longstanding protections for clean water and wetlands were drastically narrowed by the Sackett decision, we need stronger protections, not weaker, to safeguard our communities and environment.”

League of Conservation Voters Healthy Communities Program Director Madeleine Foote had a similar reaction.

“The Trump administration’s Polluted Water Rule is another blatant giveaway to big corporate polluters that will jeopardize the waters that our families and communities rely on for drinking, recreation, and fueling our local economies,” Foote said.

“In 2023, the Supreme Court’s devastating Sackett decision stripped federal protections from millions of miles of streams and tens of millions of acres of wetlands, and now corporate polluters are pushing their friends in the administration to go even further in decimating our clean water safeguards. They won’t be happy until the Clean Water Act is nothing more than words on a page and they can pollute our waters with abandon,” Foote continued.

Environmental Defense Fund Associate Vice President Will McDow stated Monday that the new proposed WOTUS rule from the Trump administration that will redefine which wetlands and waters have Clean Water Act Protections.",https://coastalreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/boiling-spring-lakes-preserve.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 03:58:12.926804

Indonesia will require an estimated Rp 3,000 trillion ($179 billion) in investment to achieve full reliance on electricity sourced from renewable energy, according to the Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry.

Jisman Hutajulu, Expert Staff for Strategic Planning at the ministry, said the required capital covers major infrastructure components, including power plant construction, substations, transmission lines, distribution networks, and other supporting systems.

“It will take roughly Rp 3,000 trillion in investment -- this is a very large figure. We are calling on all stakeholders to work hand in hand,” Jisman said in Jakarta on Wednesday.

The push toward clean electricity is considered crucial given Indonesia’s vast renewable-energy potential, estimated at 3,500 gigawatts, and its environmental advantages over fossil fuel–based generation.

Jisman noted that the ministry plans to maximize renewable-energy capacity across the country, reflecting the targets outlined in State Utility PLN’s Electricity Supply Business Plan for 2025–2034.

Under the roadmap, Indonesia aims to add 69.5 gigawatts of new power generation capacity, 47,758 circuit-kilometers of transmission infrastructure, and 107,950 megavolt-amperes (MVA) of substations.

Of the total planned 69.5 gigawatt increase, clean-energy sources will play a dominant role with the following breakdown:

76 percent, equivalent to 52.9 gigawatts, will come from renewable energy and energy-storage systems.

Renewable energy alone will contribute 42.6 gigawatts, or 61 percent of the total.

Energy-storage systems will supply 10.3 gigawatts, equal to 15 percent.

The remaining 16.6 gigawatts, or 24 percent, will come from fossil-fuel-based power plants.

The ministry emphasizes that broad collaboration -- including government, state utilities, financiers, and the private sector -- will be critical to closing the funding gap needed to realize Indonesia’s clean-energy transition.

But, the claim that a U.S-Saudi civilian nuclear deal is an accelerator to proliferation lacks credibility.

Given the Trump administration’s interest in exporting more nuclear technologies and competing for the global nuclear reactor market, the deal with Saudi Arabia should not be surprising.","Last night, the Trump Administration announced a series of diplomatic agreements with Saudi Arabia, including a long-anticipated civilian nuclear cooperation agreement. The announcement caps more than a decade of intermittent negotiations between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia over a potential civilian nuclear deal. While the defense and economic implications of the pledged deals will take center stage, the civilian nuclear agreement will not only influence Saudi Arabia’s economic development but also the strength and direction of the U.S. nuclear industry.

Key details about the deal have yet to be publicized, but the signed “Joint Declaration on the Completion of Negotiations on Civil Nuclear Energy Cooperation” is a further step towards finalizing a 123 agreement between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia. Agreements under section 123 of the Atomic Energy Act govern the transfer of U.S. civilian nuclear technology, equipment, and materials to foreign countries. These agreements require Congressional approval and are mandatory for American civilian nuclear technology to be exported.

Those opposed to a 123 agreement with the Saudis have raised the risk that a civilian nuclear program would pave the way for Saudi Arabia to acquire a nuclear weapon. Others have argued that a Saudi civilian nuclear program would also push Iran to complete the final steps to build a nuclear warhead.

But, the claim that a U.S-Saudi civilian nuclear deal is an accelerator to proliferation lacks credibility. By signing the Joint Declaration with the United States, Saudi Arabia is voluntarily opening their entire nuclear sector to American nonproliferation standards and international scrutiny; which would otherwise be lacking under a deal with another country. An agreement with the U.S. limits the possibility of turning civilian-grade nuclear materials into weapons because sensitive processes like enrichment and reprocessing are frequently checked, and can even be excluded if agreed upon by the parties.

Ultimately, inking a civilian nuclear deal that would see the United States export reactor technology to Saudi Arabia would be a boon for a U.S. nuclear industry that has been dominated by Russia in the global export market. Exporting reactors to Saudi Arabia would provide the industry with opportunities for more learning-by-doing, which can reduce overall costs of reactor construction and help to expedite domestic deployment of advanced reactors.

A Nuclear Deal Was a Long Time Coming

For more than a decade, Saudi officials have signaled that they view nuclear energy as central to the country’s economic diversification and long-term strategic positioning.

In President Trump’s first term, his administration pursued a deal to share U.S. nuclear technology with Saudi Arabia, allowing preliminary work on nuclear power as a precursor to a final nuclear cooperation agreement. Those efforts ultimately stalled when the Biden administration refrained from finalizing a deal with Saudi Arabia.

Given the Trump administration’s interest in exporting more nuclear technologies and competing for the global nuclear reactor market, the deal with Saudi Arabia should not be surprising. In May, President Trump signed a quartet of executive orders to spur the American nuclear industry. Notably, Executive Order 14299, Deploying Advanced Nuclear Reactor Technologies for National Security, acknowledged the importance of nuclear energy in American foreign policy and national security. The order specifically directs the Secretary of State to aggressively promote American nuclear exports through diplomatic engagement and negotiation of 123 Agreements.

Early in 2025, the Trump administration and Saudi officials hinted at revived talks on a possible 123 agreement, but no announcements were made and further negotiations were not publicized. Last night’s agreement is just the next step in that process. According to a White House fact sheet, the deal “builds the legal foundation for a decades-long, multi-billion-dollar nuclear energy partnership with the Kingdom; confirms that the United States and American companies will be the Kingdom’s civil nuclear cooperation partners of choice; and ensures that all cooperation will be conducted in a manner consistent with strong nonproliferation standards.”

With the Joint Declaration now complete, all that is left is finalizing the formal agreement under Section 123 of the Atomic Energy Act.

What Does the Deal Mean for U.S. Nuclear?

A civilian nuclear agreement with Saudi Arabia materially strengthens the American nuclear industry at a moment when global demand for new reactors is rising and international competitors, particularly Russia and China, are moving aggressively to capture emerging markets.

For U.S. reactor developers, the most immediate benefit is simple: reactor orders. The American nuclear sector has spent decades without new large-scale international customers, leaving companies trapped in a cycle where limited deployment constrains learning, which in turn keeps costs high and timelines long. A Saudi project, likely involving multiple reactors, would provide exactly the kind of operational learning that historically drives down costs and accelerates commercialization. A similar dynamic is already visible next door in the UAE, where the Barakah project—facilitated by the U.S.-UAE 123 Agreement—has shown how early reactor orders can build competence, reduce costs, and reinforce long-term industrial capability.

Saudi Arabia also has the capital to finance first- to nth-of-a-kind reactors, which can allow designs to move down the cost curve and become globally competitive. In the United States, utilities are structurally risk-averse when it comes to projects with very high upfront capital costs, whether it’s large gigawatt-scale plants or next-generation SMRs. American utility business models reward cost certainty, not technological ambition, and they face regulators who are understandably cautious about saddling ratepayers with multi-billion-dollar construction risks. As a result, many U.S. reactor developers find themselves trapped in a catch-22: they cannot achieve lower costs without deployment, but they cannot achieve deployment without lower costs. Foreign orders can break that cycle.

With the fiscal capacity and political will to finance early builds, Saudi Arabia can provide the market demand that allows U.S. designs to demonstrate performance, achieve serial production, and reduce costs through improved efficiency. A Saudi orderbook would help build up the U.S. nuclear supply chain. But, while a 123 agreement creates the legal pathway for U.S. exports, it does not dictate when or where the first reactors would be built. While the Trump administration could push for an early domestic success, Saudi Arabia could move more quickly than American utilities constrained by capital costs and regulatory risk. Ultimately, the combination of domestic and foreign demand is what rebuilds an industry that has gone decades without either. Multiple reactor projects create predictable, multi-year demand for steel, forgings, instrumentation and control systems, construction labor, and fuel production. That stability allows suppliers to scale, modernize, and invest while developers and end users are able to point to firm partnerships, projects, and prices.

Beyond the industrial benefits on U.S. soil, the Saudi nuclear partnership would strengthen America’s competitive position in a global market dominated by state-backed rivals. Russia, through Rosatom, is currently the dominant exporter of nuclear reactors, with major multi-reactor projects underway in Turkey, Egypt, and other countries. Such agreements guarantee long-term fuel, servicing, and financing packages that bind partner countries to Moscow for decades. China is moving in the same direction. Every country that opts for Russian or Chinese reactor technology creates a 100-year relationship between them. As global demand accelerates, the countries that show up with competitive offers will shape the next generation of nuclear markets.

The Deal Is Also a Win for Nonproliferation

Saudi Arabia was going to pursue a civilian nuclear program with or without the United States. Even with the agreement signed, Saudi Arabia can still buy reactors from the French, the Koreans, or maybe even the Chinese. And whether they signed or not, the Saudis could easily buy enrichment technology from the same place that Libya, Iran, and North Korea did: Pakistan.

That has been the largest sticking point over a deal with Saudi Arabia. But explicitly waiving enrichment and reprocessing technology is not necessary for a 123 agreement—it’s only been a stipulation in one previous agreement. The United States’ approach to nuclear cooperation agreements and nonproliferation standards has been steadfast. No matter the specific stipulations agreed to across different 123 Agreements, transparency and oversight to another country’s nuclear operation is demanded by any American 123 agreement. Not to mention, international oversight and safeguards have only improved since the U.S. started exporting civilian nuclear technology. Saudi Arabia has, after over a decade of negotiation, arrived at the signing table knowing the United States’ position on nonproliferation—suggesting the Saudi’s intent to uphold the deal.

The joint agreement signed yesterday gives the United States a role in setting conditions, imposing oversight, or influencing the direction of a Saudi nuclear program. Cooperation provides an opportunity to shape nuclear development toward transparent, peaceful use in the Gulf. Blocking engagement would not have eliminated Saudi Arabia’s long term strategic calculations; it would have only limited America’s visibility and leverage.

A U.S. 123 agreement will require Saudi Arabia to accept more stringent international safeguards and will produce a more transparent program than if Saudi Arabia had partnered with China or Russia. Those alternatives would have likely involved less rigorous oversight and higher proliferation risks, not to mention, a loss for U.S. industry.

Saudi Arabia values its links to the United States and has repeatedly signaled a preference for American nuclear technology. Riyadh likes the credibility and prestige that comes with U.S. partnerships. Building nuclear bombs while having U.S. reactor technology within a negotiated nonproliferation framework would have a very steep cost and would be technically difficult. And, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s comments suggest that if Saudi Arabia ever pursued a weapon, it would be a political decision, and it would not begin with a transparent, heavily monitored civilian nuclear program.

Crossing the T’s and Dotting the I’s

The “Joint Declaration on the Completion of Negotiations on Civil Nuclear Energy Cooperation,” secures a U.S. role in the growth and development of Saudi Arabia’s nuclear future. It preserves U.S. influence in the region and allows for the safeguarding of nuclear technologies. It also is the next step towards a new market for U.S. reactor developers who need reactor orders to secure financing, improve efficiency, and lower costs for the U.S. domestic market.

Next to come is the finalized and signed 123 Agreement, which President Trump will then send to Congress for review. The details of the agreement will carry enormous weight, setting the terms under which the United States can maintain influence, ensure transparency, and keep the program firmly within peaceful bounds. A well-crafted 123 agreement should build in safeguards, including prohibitions on reprocessing spent fuel, robust verification measures, and close cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency. It should also defer sensitive issues, such as domestic enrichment, until a future date or create an alternative mechanism, providing flexibility while keeping concerns in check.

Whether Saudi reactor orders materialize immediately or take shape over several years, the agreement gives American developers access to a new market with energy demands and plenty of capital—both of which are key to making the American nuclear industry competitive again.",https://thebreakthrough.imgix.net/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/Riyadh.jpeg?mtime=1763588435,N,,2025-11-20 11:04:53.552835

EPA Region 6 led the response to the Smitty’s Supply fire in Roseland, Louisiana, to remove over 11 million gallons of waste from the Tangipahoa River and surrounding waterways and engage with over 3,000 residents. Region 6 also issued a Safe Drinking Water Act permit for ExxonMobil’s Rose Low Carbon Solutions Class VI injection wells in Jefferson County and a Clean Air Act permit to Texas GulfLink for a deepwater port southeast of Freeport. These permits enable significant projects to move forward, creating jobs and boosting the nation’s energy economy. Region 6 also provided oversight of the depressurization of four flanged tritium waste containers at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. Air monitoring for tritium indicated no deviation from background levels.

Nationwide, this progress includes announcing a proposed rule that establishes a clear, durable, common-sense definition of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS), completing 100 days of “pressure testing” Tijuana-San Diego wastewater projects from the July 2025 U.S.-Mexico Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and accelerating timelines by nine months, secured our border from dangerous illegal pesticides through enforcement action, led emergency response efforts and cleanup efforts in communities across the nation, and so much more.

After all, what can one possibly add to the conversation?

Well, one thing that’s struck us during the current wave of AI infrastructure euphoria is how closely the pitfalls of these two mega-trends align.

For starters, both mega-trends carry more than a hint of missionary zeal.

While most reasonable people can agree the energy transition is a key plank in the fight against climate change, that does not mean all its projects will deliver a good return on investment.

Stonepeak chairman, CEO and co-founder Michael Dorrell, for one, complained about renewables’ “uninteresting” returns from the 2010s onwards, noting there had been “an awful lot of capital chasing these projects – and a lot of that capital was socially driven, as opposed to economically driven”.

In the AI world, the quest for ‘artificial general intelligence’ and its purported benefits is often pursued with a messianic fervour that threatens to cloud a focus on ROI. The latter was highlighted in a recent, much-discussed JPMorgan report on what’s needed for a projected $5 trillion in AI infrastructure capex to make economic sense.

“Big picture, to drive a 10 percent return on our modeled AI investments through 2030 would require ~$650 billion of annual revenue into perpetuity. For context, that equates to 58bps of global GDP, or $34.72/month from every current iPhone user, or $180/month from every Netflix subscriber,” the report stated.

Even if some companies are able to generate the required revenue from their AI offerings, JPMorgan warned there could be some “spectacular losers as well”.

The scale of the opportunity in both mega-trends is thus a blessing and a curse.

Which brings us to a second common point: ‘bragawatts’. Both sectors share a penchant for platforms boasting large-scale development pipelines. But as we found in our cover story last October, valuing renewables platforms is genuinely challenging, and there’s a distinct possibility that only a fraction of these extensive project pipelines will ever be built.

Given the multiple challenges facing AI infrastructure pipelines – securing power chief among them – it is entirely fair to be equally sceptical of their deliverability.

The energy transition and the AI infrastructure build-out are also inflationary, which puts the spotlight on affordability. A Rabobank report released in January concluded that a combination of factors will make the energy transition in Europe – the transition’s heartland – both inflationary and likely to increase price volatility until at least 2030.

Similarly in the US – the epicentre of data centre development – modelling by Carnegie Mellon University indicates that the growth of data centres and crypto‑mining could increase average national electricity generation costs by roughly 8 percent by 2030 under current policies. In high‑demand regional markets such as Virginia, costs could rise by as much as 25 percent.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, energy affordability was a key theme in the recent election in Virginia, with governor-elect Abigail Spanberger pledging to lower energy costs “and make sure that data centres pay their fair share”.

It’s not just about affordability, though. Like any development boom that literally dots the landscape with new physical assets, both the energy transition and AI infrastructure are vulnerable to nimbyism and the accompanying political and regulatory fallout.

Industry veterans will recall that one of the stated objectives of the former UK government’s de facto onshore wind ban – which lasted from 2015-24 – was to stop projects it said were “often imposed upon communities without consultation or public support”.

Worryingly, a new report by Data Center Watch recorded 20 projects, representing around $98 billion, being blocked across the US in Q2 due to local opposition – “a turning point in data center development risk” and more than the total for all previous quarters since 2023, the organisation said.

Now, what would it mean to include the phaseout of fossil fuels in the final climate text?
So, it was a big effort that we could include that an objective is to phase out fossil fuels, which actually was not even that language.
We should stop producing, extending the frontier of production, and also stop the consumption and burning of fossil fuels.
So, the elephant in the room is the fossil fuels.","AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org. We’re broadcasting from the U.N. climate summit — that’s COP30 — from the Brazilian city of Belém, the gateway to the Amazon. I’m Amy Goodman.

As delegates and leaders representing more than 190 countries continue negotiations, the Brazilian presidency is expected to release a new draft text today addressing some of the most pressing climate demands, including financing and the transition away from fossil fuels. Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is in Belém today as pressure is mounting to include a roadmap to phase out oil, coal and gas in the final climate text. He may pass us at any moment. More than 80 countries from Africa, Latin America, Asia and the Pacific, as well as European Union member states and the United Kingdom, have joined those calls, with Colombia leading the efforts.

This all comes as frustration is mounting over the refusal by wealthier nations and some of the world’s worst polluters to properly fund climate adaptation efforts for Global South countries most impacted by the climate crisis, but those that did not cause it.

We’re now joined by Susana Muhamad, longtime environmentalist. She served as Colombia’s minister of environment and sustainable development from 2022 to this year. She was also the president of last year’s United Nations Biodiversity Conference held in Cali, Colombia. She is of Palestinian descent.

We welcome you back to Democracy Now!, Susana. We have spoken to you at past COPs. You were the main climate negotiator at one point for Colombia. If you can initiate this global audience into what COP means, even that, the Conference of Parties 30, 30 years, why this is so important, and what’s happening today with the Brazilian president here, and what you’re seeing in the texts that have been presented?

SUSANA MUHAMAD: Thank you so much, Amy, and I’m so glad to be here again this year.

Well, it’s very important to let the audience understand what this environment means. COP is the Conference of the Parties. Who are the parties? And the parties to what? The parties are the countries of the world that have subscribed the Convention on Climate Change. And this convention is an international treaty signed by the countries to be able to control and stabilize the climate, because we knew since 30 years ago — and that’s why it’s called COP30, because it’s the 30th time that the parties meet to try to solve this issue.

But what’s the reality? You have faced it in the United States during these years, that things are getting out of control, the climate. And the emissions, the CO2 emissions that produce this climate crisis, are increasing, not decreasing, and also that the climate is becoming more wild, if we can say it in simple words, and more dangerous, the situation.

So, this 2025 COP is critical, because scientists said that we needed to cut emissions by 42% compared to 2019 in 2030, but the reality is that we are in a trajectory, rather than to decrease 42%, to increase 16%. And rather than to stabilize the climate in 1.5, we are actually going to a trajectory to have an increase in temperature of 2.8 Celsius. And just to give your audience a dimension of what that means, we have never experienced in the last two geological eras this temperature. Humanity, since it’s a species alive on planet Earth, has never experienced this temperature. We have no clue, no idea what this means. And when we could see that happening? At the end of this century. And who will be living this? The children that were already born in this century. So, that’s why this conference is the only fora that we have internationally, globally. So, countries, agree and take action.

AMY GOODMAN: I’m going to ask you about what Kumi Naidoo yesterday, the South African climate activist, called “the F-word”: fossil fuels. Now, what would it mean to include the phaseout of fossil fuels in the final climate text? And how is it possible that that hasn’t happened before?

SUSANA MUHAMAD: Well, it happened for the first time in Dubai, which was actually a very interesting process, because it was in the Arab world, in the United Arab Emirates. And you know that the largest reserves of oil in the world are there, and the cheapest ones. So, it was a big effort that we could include that an objective is to phase out fossil fuels, which actually was not even that language. It was “transition away” from fossil fuels, because it’s a transition. But what does that mean? That we should change our source of energy. We should stop producing, extending the frontier of production, and also stop the consumption and burning of fossil fuels. And that is a whole change.

So, now what happens is that it has been two years since Dubai, and the Brazilian government actually gave licenses for exploration in the Amazon, in the Amazon Delta, outside in deep waters where the Amazon River comes, just weeks before this conference. It’s a very contradictory message, because, you know, the Amazon is the — is one of the pillars of climate stability. The Amazon absorbs so much CO2. And what happens when we create deforestation is that every hectare deforested emits CO2 and stops absorbing. So, if we lose the Amazon, which means deforestation of around 25%, we actually lose the control of the climate. And we are in the Amazon. This COP is in the Amazon in 2025, five years before we need to reach the goal to stabilize the climate. And the Brazilian government gives licenses for exploration of oil a few weeks before.

So, the elephant in the room is the fossil fuels. The Arab countries don’t want to speak about it. Actually, they are trying to bring back the decision of Dubai and say, “Oh, we are — we don’t feel that that’s correct,” which was a big effort. But the good news is that yesterday a coalition of 80 countries stood up and said, “We have to develop a pathway for the transition. We cannot leave this COP.” So, the elephant in the room has become now the main issue. And it has light, and it’s now in negotiated text. And now President Lula is coming today, and Brazil is now committed that this roadmap advances.

But I give you a sober fact. Right now countries are planning to expand fossil fuel productions in 120% more than what is required to stabilize the climate at 1.5 Celsius. And for you who are seeing us out there, remember what was the year 2024, and think about in your local area how was the climate that year. That was the first year that we reached, as an average temperature in the planet, 1.5 Celsius. I remember in my country, 400 municipalities out of 1,100 were without water. The largest city, Bogotá, went into rationalizing water for one year. We had fires. We have drought. And it was actually really, like, if that’s going to be the new reality, I cannot imagine what is with 2.8. And that’s actually the environmental limiting we are working towards.

And so, to summarize, the struggle in this COP is between the fossil capital and the countries that want to continue to live on fossil fuels, and the other countries that actually say we have to put humanity, environmental security first and save the children that were already born in this century.

AMY GOODMAN: Susana Muhamad, you used to be the chief negotiator on climate at the COPs. You were the climate minister. So, can you talk about the power of the oil lobby? I mean, we’re talking about over 1,600, the largest group of lobbyists ever. Also, there are 900 Indigenous representatives. That is the largest group of Indigenous representation. So, talk about the balance. And also, are Indigenous demands being considered here? I mean, Indigenous leaders shut down this COP on Friday for hours.

SUSANA MUHAMAD: It’s exactly — I think that’s the picture of the 21st century. You want to summarize this issue in one picture? It is the picture of the woman from the Amazon, the Indigenous woman, blocking the entrance of the COP, and on the other side of the fence, the military protecting the fortress of the COP. What fortress are you protecting? You’re protecting the fossil fuel capitalists. That’s who are you protecting.

And actually, the influence in these rooms of the fossil fuel lobby is huge. That comes in two forms: petrostates that have — even Colombia has its own oil state company, but also private companies that have their lobbyists. And it becomes a battle of, actually, the fossil fuel capital resisting change. This is what COP has become. This is what it’s about now, resisting the change from the fossil fuel capital.

And outside the fence of the COP, outside the military, not 900 — 900 were the ones that got accredited. We have 4,000 Indigenous peoples from all the Amazon that came during 25 days by boat through the Amazon River, from all the communities, from the eight countries of the Amazon. They have what they call the Indigenous Camp. They are there outside. These people, they do have the knowledge to save the planet. They do have the knowledge to save the Amazon. And we are not talking about that here. So, that’s why, on Tuesday, actually, they came by force, and they took over these corridors. And that presence of what I call the blood, the sweat, the tears of the people at the frontlines of the climate crisis is what we need inside this room. And unfortunately, although we have to say it is much better in Brazil than when we had the COP in Egypt, in the United Arab Emirates and Azerbaijan, which we didn’t even were able to do the protest in the street, the march of climate — but that’s actually, I think, the forces in the 21st century, the people at the frontlines against the fossil fuel capital.

AMY GOODMAN: We only have a minute to go, but I wanted to ask you two quick questions. The significance of President Trump, for the first time the United States not sending a high-level delegation? Do you actually think that’s good or bad in terms of how they influence the outcome? And also, you are a Colombian of Palestinian descent. And your thoughts right now on what’s happening in Gaza?

SUSANA MUHAMAD: Yes, on the first one, it’s absolutely terrible the United States is not here. It is the second-biggest polluter in the world. And we, to be able — I mean, this is the problem. This problem cannot be solved by any single country. It has to be the global community together.

But the worst thing is the escalation of the conflict. Before, it used to be blocking here, as some countries are doing, but now it’s with military action. So, having the U.S. military deployment of military forces to the Caribbean have killed 80 Latin Americans, in total impunity, in the last two months, with nobody stopping that. And actually, my fear is that what President Trump is coming for is for the oil resources of Venezuela and also the minerals of Colombia and Latin and South America. If this is going to be the escalation of conflict, we actually are in a very bad shape. That’s why it will be a fantastic message from Brazil that more than 80 countries — the majority of countries said, “No, we are not going to change the agenda because there is military bullying from any powerful country right now. And we have to secure the humanity.”

And on Gaza, these are not issues that are not correlated, because they use Gaza as a laboratory, because they were able to move forward. And even President Trump declared in the Israeli parliament that the weapons were given by the U.S. to commit genocide, because this has happened, and the world, the United Nations, nobody could stop this. That’s why they have now the license, the green light, to start moving forward to pursue whatever interests they think they want to pursue. And this is why we have to strengthen the international community and multilateralism and also the resistance in the frontlines of these issues, because, I tell you something, people will not allow any military power to kill them. Even the Palestinians right now, with everything that has happened, are still resisting. And that’s actually a lesson from all of us, because if the defense of the environment will become a military conflict, we are already seeing in Palestine what will happen in the future. I don’t wish that future. I think we can actually — humanity can do better, and that we can be very proactive and productive in shifting this situation of climate crisis, rather than continue investing in arms, in armies and in defense, as the whole world is doing. So, there’s no money for climate, but then everybody, in two seconds, puts 5% of their GDP in defense.

AMY GOODMAN: Well, Susana Muhamad, we want to thank you so much for being with us, a longtime environmentalist, served as Colombia’s minister of environment and sustainable development from 2022 to earlier this year, also president of the 2024 U.N. Biodiversity Conference held in Cali, Colombia. She is of Palestinian descent.

COP30 High-Level Champion Dan Ioschpe said that the plan is “practical, science-based, inclusive, and uses the global stocktake as its guiding star.” The COP29 High-Level Champion Nigar Arpadarai emphasized that COPs are an important “check-point for delivery of climate actions,” but that progress needs to be made year-round. This session recognized the essential role of civil society, businesses, Indigenous peoples, and youth in advancing climate solutions, and Ioschpe plugged the UNFCCC Global Climate Action Tracker, which captures the activities of 20,845 companies, 14,439 cities, and 6,273 organizations.

Hot Seat: European Climate Commissioner Wopke Hoekstra played defense at a press conference today. When grilled about the EU’s lack of formal support for a roadmap for a fossil fuel phaseout, Hoekstra stated that the EU “liked the idea” but is not tied to specific terminology. According to Carbon Brief, all countries in the EU except Italy and Poland have individually voiced their support of the roadmap. He repeatedly emphasized the EU’s overall dedication to deliver on the climate finance that countries agreed to at COP29 and reduce emissions 55% by 2030 and 90% by 2040 (compared to 1990 levels).

High Standards: The EU CBAM will go into effect in January 2026. A UNFCCC briefing gathered international trade and standardization experts to illustrate the work being done in the lead-up to implementation. Jacob Werksman, principal advisor to the European Commission, described the development of mechanisms to assess carbon prices and emissions, including rules around emissions verification. Some developing countries are concerned that CBAM policies unfairly impact their exports. Werksman defended the EU CBAM as a lever for green trade, rather than a trade measure in itself, and asserted that it will not have a negative impact on trade. According to the CBAM Economic Exposure Index, some countries will experience economic impacts if they do not shift their practices to reduce emissions (which is precisely the goal of this type of policy). Negative impacts are projected to be most concentrated in Egypt, Uzbekistan, Ukraine, India, and Mozambique.

Landmark Launch for Landscapes: The Scaling-Up Resilience in Africa’s Great Green Wall (SURAGGWA) program was officially launched this morning. The Green Climate Fund approved funding for the SURAGGWA program in July, with an investment of $222 million to restore degraded landscapes and build climate resilience across eight Sahel countries within the Great Green Wall region: Burkina Faso, Chad, Djibouti, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, and Senegal. The program will contribute to the broader initiative to restore 100 million hectares of degraded land, sequester 250 million tons of carbon, and create 10 million green jobs by 2030. Senegal’s Minister of Environment and Ecological Transition underlined the importance of fighting against poverty while ensuring sustainable development. He expressed hopes that the SURAGGWA program will foster collaboration across participating countries and stakeholders. Green Climate Fund Regional Director of Africa Catherine Koffman added that partnerships across all levels of governance will be especially critical due to the complex operating environment in a region marred by conflict.

Biodiversity, Quantified: An SDG Pavilion event showcased the Nature Conservation Index, which assesses conservation at the country level using 25 indicators spanning land management, threats to biodiversity, national capacity (financial, technical, and political), and future challenges to conservation. Of the 180 countries evaluated, Luxembourg ranks highest for its land protections, strong policies, and high biodiversity, followed by Estonia and Denmark. The last three ranks fell to Iraq, Turkey, and Kiribati, which holds the lowest score due to species decline and poor land protections. The U.S. ranks 37th, scoring low on indicators such as climate vulnerability, risk of ecosystem collapse, and species extinction.

Shell-ebrating Stories About Ocean Acidification: The International Alliance to Combat Ocean Acidification (OA Alliance) held a virtual premiere of its short film, Changing Waters: Time for Action on Ocean Acidification. Juliana Corrales of the OA Alliance described recent efforts to revamp the messaging around ocean acidification—the chemical reaction that lowers the pH of seawater as the ocean is forced to absorb increasing amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, hindering the ability of marine species to grow calcium carbonate structures like shells. With such a complex scientific topic, Corrales explained that the goal of the film is to motivate action by making the impacts of ocean acidification felt through stories from coastal communities in Washington State, Colombia, and Fiji.

Investable NDCs: The We Mean Business Coalition is looking to NDCs as roadmaps for investment. Over the last year, the coalition has worked with partners in Australia, Brazil, the EU, India, Indonesia, Japan, South Africa, South Korea, and the UK to understand how NDCs could be written to attract more private-sector interest to help deliver on their goals. The country-specific recommendations include having clear international coordination on traded products, consistent national policy, and complementary economy-wide and sector-specific targets.

A View from Thailand: A press conference hosted by the Global Forest Coalition gave the mic to Wanun Permpibul of Climate Watch Thailand, who discussed “false climate solutions” that commodify ecosystems and put a price on nature. Permpibul branded the blue economy initiatives of wealthy nations as coastal and marine resource grabs and a “recolonization of the ocean, one carbon credit at a time.” She also criticized loans and debt-for-nature swaps that lock developing countries into cycles of debt and dependency. On the reliance on critical minerals for the clean energy transition, she called out the extortive practices of lithium mining in the Philippines, rare earth mining in Thailand, and nickel mining in Indonesia. True climate solutions already exist in the Global South, Permpibul concluded, with fishers and farmers alike working to restore ecosystems—without private loans or carbon credits.

Pacific Islands Plan for Climate Consequences: Delegates met at the Pacific Pavilion to discuss the Pacific Regional Framework on Climate Mobility Implementation Plan, which builds on a mobility framework that Pacific Island countries agreed to in 2023. The implementation plan states that planned relocation, migration, and displacement are all inevitable due to climate impacts. To prepare, the region can take priority actions like conducting country risk assessments, creating a Climate Mobility Action Hub, increasing country-to-country dialogue on planned relocation, ensuring plans are culturally appropriate, and finding adequate funding.

Governance for Resilient Infrastructure: The Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure released the Global Infrastructure Resilience 2025 report to guide countries in making climate-smart infrastructure investments. This second-edition report includes a broader set of risks that now includes extreme heat and cold events. It states that “resilience begins with governance. Weak enforcement of codes, outdated standards, and fragmented responsibilities often compound infrastructure risks. Strengthening regulatory compliance and institutional capacity must, therefore, be at the core of national resilience strategies.”

More on Resilience: At a side event on local leadership for global adaptation, speakers discussed the forces reshaping community resilience efforts. As Aditya Bahadur of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre explained, “the nature of risk is shifting rapidly,” and countries are seeing unanticipated pressure on emergency management systems due to multiple extreme events happening at the same time. Bahadur argued that it is unfortunately not realistic for public finance to close the adaptation gap, so local leaders need to use creative strategies like city resilience bonds and incorporating resilience into existing budget items. He further suggested using artificial intelligence to analyze big data sets that could inform more strategic investments of time and money. The event also highlighted the Beat the Heat Implementation Drive, an initiative launched last week at COP30, to support city-level resilience to extreme heat.

Hot Topic: At a UNFCCC side event, panelists shared examples of communities in vulnerable regions responding to extreme heat with early warning systems, adaptation finance, and other tools. Joyce Kimutai of World Weather Attribution said that national climate commitments have not kept up with the escalating heat risk associated with climate change even though predictions have improved. In the case of India, 76% of the population is in the high to very-high heat risk category. Vishwas Chitale of the Council on Energy, Environment and Water noted that many jurisdictions have heat action plans, but most lack information on localized hazards, humidity, and warm nights, and almost all lack heat vulnerability and risk assessments.

The measure passed the House Tuesday, largely along party lines. It passed the Senate three weeks ago and goes next to the president’s desk.

The action is the latest by Republicans in Congress and the Trump administration to erase President Biden’s environmental legacy and revert to what the first Trump administration achieved.

As Alaska’s all-Republican congressional delegation sees it, Biden’s plan for the NPR-A would’ve locked up about half the reserve to oil development.

Alaska Congressman Nick Begich says Congress is halting the resource-management whiplash by using the Congressional Review Act. It forbids reimposing a nullified rule.

“So a future administration can't come in and decide to do something similar without the express authorization of Congress,"" he said.

Development advocates say the Trump plan is more pragmatic and that regulatory certainty will attract investment.

House Democrats who opposed the change argued that the Biden plan protected wildlife species and the landscape of one of the least developed tracts in the federal inventory.

I. EPA and U.S. Army Corps Propose Revised WOTUS Definition After Sackett

On Nov. 17, 2025, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced a proposed rule to revise the definition of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS) under the Clean Water Act in response to the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2023 decision in Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency. The agencies stated that the proposal aims to “provide greater regulatory certainty and increase Clean Water Act program predictability and consistency by clarifying the definition of ‘waters of the United States.’” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin emphasized the need to set “clear and practical rules of the road that accelerate economic growth and opportunity.” The agencies stated that the proposal is intended to “restore and maintain the quality of the Nation’s waters while respecting State and Tribal authority over their own land and water resources.”

The proposed rule outlines the categories of waters that would fall within federal jurisdiction. As summarized by the agencies, WOTUS “would include (1) traditional navigable waters and the territorial seas; (2) most impoundments of “waters of the United States;” (3) relatively permanent tributaries of traditional navigable waters, the territorial seas, and impoundments; (4) wetlands adjacent (i.e., having a continuous surface connection) to traditional navigable waters, impoundments, and tributaries; and (5) lakes and ponds that are relatively permanent and have a continuous surface connection to a traditional navigable water, the territorial seas, or a tributary. The agencies are also proposing to amend the exclusions for waste treatment systems, prior converted cropland, and certain ditches, and to add an exclusion for groundwater.”

The proposal introduces and clarifies key terms that will guide jurisdictional determinations post-Sackett:

Relatively permanent: Proposed to include features “standing or continuously flowing bodies of surface water that are standing or continuously flowing year-round or at least during the wet season.” The “wet season” construct “is intended to include extended periods of predictable, continuous surface hydrology occurring in the same geographic feature year after year.”

Continuous surface connection: Proposed to mean “having surface water at least during the wet season and abutting (i.e., touching) a jurisdictional water.”

Tributary: Proposed to mean “a body of water with relatively permanent flow, and a bed and bank, that connects to a downstream traditional navigable water or the territorial seas, either directly or through one or more waters or features that convey relatively permanent flow.” The proposal clarifies that a tributary “does not include a body of water that contributes surface water to a downstream jurisdictional water through a feature such as a channelized non-jurisdictional surface water feature, subterranean river, culvert, dam, tunnel, or similar artificial feature, or through a debris pile, boulder field, wetland, or similar natural feature, if such feature does not convey relatively permanent flow. When the tributary is part of a water transfer (as that term is applied under 40 CFR 122.3) currently in operation, the tributary would retain jurisdictional status.”

The proposed rule’s revised definitions and expanded exclusions for federal jurisdiction, including clarifications on groundwater, ditches, waste treatment systems and prior converted cropland, could significantly reshape which water features and wetlands are subject to federal oversight. If finalized, these changes could have far-reaching effects on landowners, farmers and developers in the regulatory roles of states and tribes. Stakeholders with ongoing or planned permitting under Clean Water Act Sections 402 and 404 should closely evaluate how the updated definitions and exclusions may affect jurisdictional determinations, especially regarding conveyances, breaks in surface connectivity and seasonal hydrology.

The agencies are soliciting public comment on the proposed rule for 45 days once published in the Federal Register. The EPA and the Army Corps will host two hybrid public meetings on the updated definition of WOTUS.

II. Trump Administration Proposes Closing Chemical Safety Hazard Investigation Board

In further efforts to downsize the federal government, President Donald Trump proposed eliminating the Chemical Safety Hazard Investigation Board (CSB). The CSB’s role is to make safety recommendations after root-cause investigations to prevent future chemical releases. As an independent nonregulatory federal agency, its investigations do not result in the issuing of fines, citations or jail time.

While the CSB has no authority to create or enforce the policy recommendations it makes as a result of its investigations, the investigations themselves can bring significant negative publicity and cause substantial business disruptions. In recent years, reportable incidents were shared publicly on the CSB’s website, including animated reenactment videos of chemical release incidents.

Since 1998 the CSB has issued more than 1,000 recommendations to address safety issues causing chemical release incidents. The CSB most recently released a final report on Sept. 25, 2025, detailing its investigation in an accidental anhydrous ammonia release at Cuisine Solutions, a prepared foods manufacturer, in Sterling, Virginia. Trump’s budget proposal will put similar investigations to an end.

The Trump administration proposed eliminating funding to the CSB “as part of the Administration’s plans to move the Nation towards fiscal responsibility and to redefine the proper role of the Federal Government.” The balance of the CSB’s remaining funds were directed to be used for “expenses necessary to carry out the closure of the Board.” Id. at 1048.

The Trump administration argues the CSB is duplicative of other agencies such as the EPA and OSHA. This argument is reinforced by the fact that the CSB has no authority to create or enforce the policy recommendations from its studies. Supporters of the CSB counter that the nonregulatory nature of the CSB is intentional and works to ensure broad enhancements for public safety that only independent investigations can bring.

If Congress adopts the president’s recommendation and closes the CSB, businesses will see a reduction in negative publicity after accidental chemical releases and face less confusion caused by oversight from multiple agencies. However, businesses will still be subject to investigation by the EPA, OSHA or other agencies with jurisdiction after accidental chemical release incidents. Businesses also will continue to face potential liability.

III. EPA Proposes Updates to Chemical Risk Evaluation Process Under TSCA

On Sept. 22, 2025, the EPA published a proposed rule to revise how it evaluates risks of chemicals already in commerce under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). Zeldin stated the proposal brings a “clear, predictable, commonsense approach” that supports safety and economic growth, in line with Trump’s Executive Order 14219 and the administration’s “Powering the Great American Comeback” agenda. The proposed rule revises elements of the 2024 regulation, Procedures for Chemical Risk Evaluation under TSCA.

Proposed changes include:

Requiring risk determinations for each condition of chemical use, not just the substance as a whole.

Clarifying how worker protections (e.g., PPE, industrial controls) are considered.

Outlining the EPA’s discretion in selecting uses and exposure pathways to evaluate.

Updating definitions and processes to ensure transparency and meet legal deadlines.

Adjusting requirements for manufacturers requesting EPA-led risk evaluations.

The public comment period for the proposed rule ended on Nov. 7, 2025.

IV. EPA Considers Revoking Endangerment Finding

In 2009, the EPA issued the Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases Under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act — known as the “Endangerment Finding” — which concluded that greenhouse gases pose a threat to public health and supported regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles. EPA later made generally similar endangerment findings to support regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from various industries, such as power plants and oil and gas facilities. The Finding listed six greenhouse gases for the danger they pose together to public health and welfare: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride.

The Endangerment Finding traces back to the 2007 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, which held that greenhouse gases are pollutants under the Clean Air Act and directed the EPA to determine whether they endanger public health and welfare under Section 202 of the Clean Air Act. The EPA’s determination that six greenhouse gases meet the endangerment criteria enabled the agency to regulate emissions from vehicles. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit upheld the Finding and the Supreme Court declined review. The Finding has since served as the legal cornerstone of federal climate action.

On July 29, 2025, the EPA proposed revoking the Endangerment Finding. Without the Endangerment Finding, the EPA lacks authority under Section 202 of the Clean Air Act to set emission standards for new motor vehicles and engines. The EPA simultaneously proposed eliminating greenhouse gas emission regulations for vehicles.

Under the proposal, engine and vehicle manufacturers would no longer have future obligations to measure, control or report greenhouse gas emissions for any highway engines or vehicles, including model years produced before the proposal. The EPA would, however, keep in place rules governing criteria pollutant and air toxic testing and standards, Corporate Average Fuel Economy testing, and related fuel economy labeling requirements.

The EPA asserted that, if adopted, the proposal would remove the legal foundation for an estimated $1 trillion in costly regulations and yield more than $54 billion in annual savings. The EPA contends that sweeping vehicle greenhouse gas regulations created major uncertainties and substantial costs for the auto industry. According to the EPA, revoking the Endangerment Finding would deliver greater certainty and regulatory relief so that companies can plan effectively, giving consumers greater access to affordable vehicle choices.

The deadline for public comments on the EPA’s proposal to rescind the Endangerment Finding was Sept. 22, 2025. With the federal shutdown, a decision on revoking the Endangerment Finding may be delayed until early 2026.

V. EPA Extends Deadlines for Coal Ash Groundwater Monitoring

On July 17, 2025, the EPA issued a direct final rule and companion proposal that will extend the compliance deadlines for coal combustion residual (CCR) management unit (CCRMU) requirements under new CCR regulations that went into effect in November 2024. In the announcement, Zeldin stated that the rule would assist in keeping energy affordable and reliable by providing “much needed regulatory relief for the power sector.”

Under the 2024 CCR rule, certain areas of CCR disposal outside regulated units, as well as certain legacy CCR surface impoundments, will become subject to groundwater monitoring, corrective action, closure and post-closure care requirements regardless of how or when that CCR was placed. Facility owners are required to conduct facility-wide evaluations to determine whether any CCRMUs exist on-site that contain greater than one ton of CCR.

The original deadline for these evaluations was February 2026. The EPA agreed to give companies an extra year, until Feb. 8, 2027, to inspect and report on their coal ash impoundments, while companies have until Aug. 8, 2029, to install groundwater monitoring systems. The remaining interrelated CCRMU compliance deadlines were also extended.

Originally, coal power plant operators were required to submit part one of their Facility Evaluation Report (FER Part 1) on Feb. 9, 2026. The second report (FER Part 2), which involves a physical evaluation of the facility, was due on Feb. 8, 2027. Under the 2025 direct final rule, facility owners may now opt to combine FER Part 1 and FER Part 2 into a single submission due Feb. 8, 2027.

The EPA determined an extension was necessary after receiving consistent reports of industrywide shortages of qualified contractors as well as issues with the aging infrastructure of the industry. Many existing records are physical documents in poor or illegible condition. The EPA determined that a robust monitoring plan should not proceed until all CCRMUs are identified and mapped under the FER process, which will take larger operations additional time.

VI. Courts Uphold EPA’s Interpretation of Coal Ash Closure Requirements

Subtitle D of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act addresses the disposal of solid and hazardous waste, including coal ash, in the United States. The EPA promulgated the first coal ash disposal regulation in 2015. The 2015 rule established the process for closing CCR units that begin to contaminate groundwater. In 2020, an amendment to the 2015 rule reclassified unlined coal-residual units as “open dumps” requiring their closure beginning April 11, 2021, but permitted extensions up to Oct. 15, 2024, if owners could show compliance with all other requirements. In 2024, another amendment regarding “legacy ponds” included updates to the definitions of “liquids” and “infiltration.”

Gavin Power sought an extension of the April 11, 2021, deadline to close one of its CCR units. The EPA denied the extension request, in part, due to Gavin Power’s failure to comply with closure requirements on a separate closed coal-residual unit. Gavin Power had an unlined, closed coal-residual unit where coal ash was up to 40% flooded with groundwater.

Gavin Power appealed to the D.C. Circuit, arguing that the EPA amended the 2015 Rule to create a new waste-in-place closure requirement by prohibiting any groundwater saturation. The D.C. Circuit held that the minimize-groundwater-saturation requirement was clear from the text of the 2015 Rule, and no new legislative rule was created in denying Gavin Power an extension. See Elec. Energy, Inc. v. Envtl. Protec. Agency, 106 F.4th 31 (D.C. Cir. 2024).

Gavin Power attempted to bring an Administrative Procedure Act case before the Southern District of Ohio alleging that the EPA retroactively applied amendments to the 2015 rule to label Gavin Power a “significant noncomplier.” On Aug. 26, 2025, Judge Michael H. Watson entered an order in Gavin Power, LLC v. EPA. Judge Watson agreed that the minimize-groundwater-saturation requirement was not new; instead, the 2015 Rule always required units closed with waste-in-place to minimize inflow and outflow of groundwater. Watson held that this would be the case based on the plain text and following issue preclusion from the D.C. Circuit’s decision.

Citing SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U.S. 194, 203 (1947), Watson further held that, even if the EPA could be said to be applying a new principle retroactively, the EPA could do so when the “mischief of producing a result which is contrary to a statutory design or to legal and equitable principles” is greater than the “ill effect of the retroactive application.”

VII. Data Centers

The EPA announced an expedited chemical review for data centers to facilitate domestic expansion in AI. The EPA effort is accompanied by an executive order, “Accelerating Federal Permitting of Data Center Infrastructure.” The EPA hopes to get through what it has characterized as a “massive backlog of new chemical reviews” slowing down data center and AI projects.

Newly developed chemicals that the industry wants to use, such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances for specialized cooling systems, are subject to environmental and health reviews under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). Any chemical that is not on the TSCA Inventory is considered a “new chemical substance.” If a chemical creates an “unreasonable risk,” it can be restricted by the EPA. Supporters of the change contend that the current process was not transparent and unreasonably slowed down business development.

The new expedited process will likely benefit other industries, such as the fossil fuel, nuclear and semiconductor industries, as they have corresponding business with qualifying projects.

In addition to the new stretch of offshore pipeline, the project also proposes building nearly 3.5 miles of onshore pipeline near and through New Jersey wetlands.
That’s the state regulatory agency tasked with setting utility rate increases and deciding whether the pipeline is necessary.
Even the city of New York, which would receive gas from the pipeline, agrees.","If constructed, the NESE pipeline would connect to an existing pipeline in Pennsylvania and then, after passing through New Jersey, run 23 miles underneath the ecologically sensitive Raritan Bay and the lower New York–New Jersey Harbor. The pipeline would end a few miles off the Rockaway Peninsula in Queens, New York.

In addition to the new stretch of offshore pipeline, the project also proposes building nearly 3.5 miles of onshore pipeline near and through New Jersey wetlands. And it would necessitate building a new natural gas compressor station in northern New Jersey too—a tax on local air quality in one of the most populous regions of the country.

This very same proposal has failed several times. However, emboldened by the new political landscape and the Trump administration’s call for fossil fuel expansion, Williams tried its luck again and resubmitted the application for another go-round.

“Both states have taken 180-degree turns from their previous legal and scientific determinations,” says Mark Izeman, senior strategist with NRDC’s environmental health team. “And they’ve given no reasoned explanation for reversing course.”

The state water quality certificates from New York and New Jersey were one of the final steps to getting the project off the ground. Earlier this year, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission also issued a rushed federal permit for the pipeline, which NRDC and Earthjustice attorneys are challenging in court due to its reliance on an outdated application that doesn’t account for current cost estimates, gas demand, or air pollution standards. Alarmingly, Williams doesn’t explain how it would avoid violating water quality standards.

The proposed dredging methods are also particularly damaging. “There’s not a good way to dredge here that’s protective for the environment,” Knicley says, “but they’ve chosen some of the most destructive ways possible.”

Burying a pipeline under a 23-mile stretch of seabed is inherently disruptive—but particularly so when the waterway in question has accumulated decades’ worth of pollution in its sediment. Left undisturbed, the harbor’s seabed has captured and contained pollutants that range from neurotoxic heavy metals like mercury, copper, and lead to synthetic “forever chemicals” such as PCBs and carcinogenic dioxins.

Dredging the seabed effectively kicks up this toxic history. The pollution would endanger still-recovering wildlife populations, such as oysters, clams, and other shellfish. Meanwhile, at the top of the food chain, species such as striped bass and humpback whales would ingest the largest amount of the contamination due to bioaccumulation. The pollution would also be a risk to public health.

“The water quality violations are really foundational,” Knicley says. “Can you safely swim here? Can you safely eat fish from here?”

Tens of thousands of people live near NESE’s impact zone—and even more enjoy New York and New Jersey’s beaches each year. “Our kids, when they were young, spent hours a day in the water,” Flynn recalls. “To see it become a cesspool, it’s horrifying.”

At the heart of the company’s argument for the pipeline is the claim that National Grid, the primary gas utility serving downstate New York, would struggle to reliably meet gas demand without NESE, particularly for heating during big winter storms. But this justification proves false, even when crunching the numbers from the New York Public Service Commission.

That’s the state regulatory agency tasked with setting utility rate increases and deciding whether the pipeline is necessary. The commission green-lit the project in its recently finalized long-term plan, despite the fact that in September, it determined that New York wouldn’t face any supply issues for at least 15 years.

Back in 2024, the commission did rely on a dire prediction from National Grid about the state’s inability to meet the demand for gas, but “anyone paying attention knew that this forecast was systemically inflated,” says Chris Casey, NRDC’s director of utility regulations in New York.

And the updated data showed that the NESE would effectively be an unnecessary and very pricey insurance policy. In a petition requesting the commission to rescind its approval, NRDC points out that it relied on outdated forecasts and failed to complete necessary cost-benefit analyses.

Meanwhile, smarter solutions already exist that can meet projected demand, especially given that NESE itself would only increase downstate New York’s natural gas supply by 13 percent. “Instead, we need to go heavy on energy efficiency and electrification and then do everything we can to get clean energy to meet our power needs,” Casey says.

Such alternatives—which would look like weatherizing and electrifying outdated buildings so that they require less gas for heating—would help solve supply issues. They would also have reverberating benefits, such as creating jobs, improving local air quality, and saving consumers money on their winter heating bills.

Even the city of New York, which would receive gas from the pipeline, agrees. In its comments on the commission’s long-term plan, city officials described NESE as a “leap backwards.” They went on to state that “National Grid had identified solutions to reliability concerns…and offers nothing now to explain why building NESE should be a preferred alternative.”

According to the National Grid, NESE would reduce energy costs for New Yorkers, but this claim rests on a flawed analysis and hinges on statewide benefits that are largely speculative. Even under National Grid’s own assumptions, its downstate customers—those in New York City and Long Island residents—would be footing the pipeline’s entire $1 billion–plus bill over the next 15 years.

These customers could expect more than a 3.5 percent increase in their gas bills that would effectively subsidize any of NESE’s theoretical benefits to the state.

“Are we just going to charge regular New Yorkers, who are already struggling with their utility bills?” asks Kim Fraczek, the director of the environmental nonprofit Sane Energy Project, which has fought the pipeline since its initial proposal. “This doesn’t sit well with us.”

As mandated by New York’s own climate law, the state needs to drastically reduce carbon emissions to meet its 40 percent reduction target by 2030—a goal that it’s already woefully behind on.

But with a federal administration that’s openly hostile to clean energy, elected state officials, including those in Albany, may see an all-of-the-above approach to energy policy as the safer political bet. The fact remains, however, that relying on fossil fuels is neither environmentally nor economically sound.

NESE would lock New York into decades of natural gas consumption right when the state should be picking up the pace on climate action. Williams’s pipeline would also reduce the urgency for clean energy investment and likely encourage regulators to lean more heavily on natural gas simply to get the most out of their investment.

“Regulators don’t tend to approve major infrastructure projects and then regulate in a way that they go underutilized,” Casey says. “It enables and creates pressure to increase gas demand—growth that isn’t planned and runs against state climate policy—just to defray the project’s substantial costs.”

With Clean Water Act certificates from both states in hand, Williams has gotten further with its NESE project now than it has in the past. But the battle against the pipeline continues, inside and outside the courtroom.

Lawsuits at the federal level and a petition for the New York Public Service Commission to revoke its approval are already underway. And as always, NRDC is pushing for the kind of clean energy initiatives, such as offshore wind development and energy efficiency programs, that demonstrate how fossil fuel projects like NESE are indeed unnecessary.",https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/styles/social_sharing_1200x630/public/2025-11/fishing-new-york-harbor-JPNLwWr_HPI.jpg?h=0e5c3eaf&itok=RcVUiEAe,N,,2025-11-19 23:58:23.586507

Texas Tech University’s Global Laboratory for Energy Asset Management & Manufacturing (GLEAMM) has received $1.25 million in funding from Google’s philanthropy Google.org to advance research on artificial intelligence (AI) data center load management and electric grid flexibility. Google’s support is part of a $40 billion investment in Texas announced last week by Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Governor Greg Abbott.

The project addresses a critical challenge: AI workloads consume 10-100 megawatts per facility, creating significant stress on electric grids during peak demand periods. The research will explore how computational loads can be scheduled, modulated or geographically shifted to support grid flexibility while integrating renewable energy and energy storage.

Texas Tech is uniquely positioned to address these emerging challenges, combining proximity to several very large data center projects on the South Plains with access to diverse power sources, including substantial wind and solar generation, as well as world-class expertise and infrastructure at GLEAMM.

“Powering the next era of AI requires both world-class infrastructure and a resilient electric grid,” said Robert Barron-Pryce, Google.org Giving Manager at Google. “As part of our broader investment in Texas, we’re proud to support the work Texas Tech is doing to directly address the complex challenge of managing large data center loads. By helping accelerate their research on smart load scheduling and optimization, together we’re ensuring that Texas maintains reliable, affordable power while continuing to lead in technology innovation.”

The multidisciplinary research team includes Argenis Bilbao, senior director of GLEAMM; Manohar Chahama, assistant professor in the College of Arts & Sciences’ Department of Renewable Energy; and Stephen Bayne, vice president for national security & executive director, Critical Infrastructure Security Institute. Together, they bring expertise in AI, machine learning, renewable energy, energy storage integration, power systems and energy management.

Leveraging tools at GLEAMM designed explicitly for adoption at scale by resource facilities and industry partners, as well as Texas Tech’s real-world microgrid and real-time simulator, the team will model electrical systems with large data center loads and optimize scheduling based on renewable generation periods.

“I’m sincerely thankful to Google for their generous support,” Bilbao said. “I’m excited to use these funds to push forward our research on improving datacenter energy consumption, energy management and overall energy awareness, and to develop solutions that can be applied in commercial datacenter environments.”

The appropriations process is one of the most important, and overlooked, ways we protect public lands and outdoor recreation.
It’s how we ensure that public lands are well-managed, sustainable, and protected for everyone who loves the outdoors.
The outdoor community has played a key role this year in keeping public lands public and defending conservation policy.
Our voices are vital to ensuring public lands and waters get the funding and resources they need.","After a challenging year for the outdoors, beginning with the agencies losing up to 25% of their workforce and most recently weathering the longest government shutdown in history, America’s public lands and waters are feeling the strain. Visitors have noticed it too: closed visitor centers, overflowing trailhead trash cans, delayed trail projects, and thinning ranks of the rangers and specialists who make outdoor recreation possible.

But with Congress working on long-term appropriations bills that will fund our public land management agencies, right now is a key moment for the outdoor community to speak up and advocate for public land funding. Fortunately, the Senate Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill, which passed out of Committee with strong bipartisan support earlier this summer, would provide stability for public lands. It maintains or expands funding for major recreation and conservation programs, and provides clear Congressional direction on how funds for public lands and waters should be spent.

Over the past year, staffing at the National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, and U.S. Forest Service has dropped by up to 25%. That’s thousands of permanent employees—including many who work directly on recreation, conservation, planning, permitting, and visitor safety.

These losses hit every part of the recreation experience: fewer people to process trail proposals or climbing management plans, slower maintenance cycles, and limited capacity to partner with local nonprofits and volunteers. At the same time, participation in outdoor recreation is near record highs.

This year’s government shutdown left public lands open but understaffed. Agencies furloughed thousands of staff, putting basic maintenance on the back burner, even as visitors continued to recreate on our public lands.

Although Outdoor Alliance has written many times about the long and complex appropriations process, Congress hasn’t actually passed full-year funding bills for public lands in over a year. Instead, a series of continuing resolutions (CRs) have kept the government running.

“This year made one thing clear: a world-class public lands system needs long-term funding and adequate staffing. Public lands are the backbone of a $1.2 trillion outdoor recreation economy, and they deserve stable, bipartisan support. Congress has a real opportunity right now to pass a full-year funding bill that will help land managers get back on their feet and give communities the certainty they need. We hope lawmakers to finish the job,” said Adam Cramer, CEO of Outdoor Alliance.

The appropriations process is one of the most important, and overlooked, ways we protect public lands and outdoor recreation. As more people head outside and climate impacts strain our parks, trails, rivers, and forests, agencies like the Forest Service and BLM need stable funding for staff and resources to keep up. Starting with the President’s budget and stretching through hearings, committee work, and negotiations almost all year, appropriations determines whether trails get maintained, campgrounds stay open, and wildfires are managed responsibly. Outdoor Alliance and our partners engage at every step—submitting testimony, meeting with lawmakers, and mobilizing outdoor enthusiasts—because without adequate funding, even the best outdoor policies can’t be implemented. It’s how we ensure that public lands are well-managed, sustainable, and protected for everyone who loves the outdoors.

The outdoor community has played a key role this year in keeping public lands public and defending conservation policy. Our voices are vital to ensuring public lands and waters get the funding and resources they need. Outdoor Alliance will continue working with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to advance a strong, bipartisan appropriations bill. With your help, we can ensure that the places we love—and the people who care for them—get the support they need.",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/54aabb14e4b01142027654ee/t/691e5cee9a63262492a63af8/1763597550743/gantas-vaiciulenas-mzR7Ksf2UEA-unsplash.jpg?format=1500w,N,,2025-11-19 21:59:14.724370

Some are betting on better APRs or extra rebates, some expect price cuts as automakers clear 2025 inventory, and some are aligning their purchase with the last window for certain tax credits or rebates. Here’s a recent comment from Reddit:

“I’m looking to purchase a Premium AWD Tesla Model Y in the next 6 months.

Given the tax credits have now expired, do folks here think there will be some additional incentives the company will give out to reduce pricing a bit?

End of year sale? 0% APR?

Should I buy now or wait till end of year?

Thanks!”

Impact of the Federal Tax Credit Expiration

The expiration of the federal EV tax credit at the end of September created a shock in the electric vehicle market. Many of the most affordable EV deals relied on a leasing loophole that allowed automakers to pass the tax credit directly to consumers. Once that loophole closed, prices rose and sales dropped sharply. EV sales appeared especially weak in October because shoppers had rushed to buy in July through September in order to beat the deadline, which caused artificially high comparisons. Analysts note that the sales decline was influenced by both the loss of incentives and the pull-ahead effect created by months of frantic buying.

Current Availability of EV Deals and Lease Offers

Even without the tax credit, manufacturers are still offering attractive lease and finance deals to keep EVs moving. Low monthly payments, ultra-low down payments and 0% financing terms make many models appealing for first-time EV shoppers. Automakers have stepped in with incentives to make up for some of the lost $7,500 credit, and these programs are helping soften the drop in demand. Buyers with good credit are still finding opportunities to test EV ownership without committing to full purchase prices.

Some EV Deals Available Today

A wide range of EVs currently feature competitive lease or finance offers. Budget-friendly options include the Kia Niro EV with the cheapest monthly payment in the segment and the Ford Mustang Mach-E that brings strong performance for the price. Subaru is offering the Solterra with an especially low upfront cost as dealers work to clear out 2025 inventory. Luxury shoppers can explore the Mercedes-Benz EQB at a noticeable discount due to its upcoming discontinuation. Larger families have appealing choices such as the Kia EV9 and the Honda Prologue, while shoppers seeking great acceleration, charging speed or maximum value can gravitate toward the Hyundai Ioniq 5, Ioniq 6 or Kia EV6. Ford continues to attract interest with the F-150 Lightning thanks to strong capability and a lease option that keeps the payment competitive for a full-size electric pickup.

Why EV Sales Fell After September

The sharp sales decline following September was dramatic. J. D. Power reported that EVs dropped from 12.9 percent of new vehicle retail sales in September to only 5.2% in October. CarGurus observed an even steeper fall, estimating a 68% decline in early October compared to early September. Analysts caution that the drop is not solely caused by the tax credit expiration, since many buyers had already rushed to purchase in previous months. The market is now working through the gap left after that buying surge, which makes current demand look softer than it may actually be.

Automakers Are Giving Aggressive Incentives

Automakers are responding with aggressive programs aimed at restoring affordability. Companies like General Motors are raising residual values on leases to recreate some of the financial benefit of the former tax credit. Many manufacturers are embracing bigger discounts, which reached an average of more than $13,000 in October, a sharp increase from earlier in the year. The goal is to entice buyers who may have missed the tax credit or who did not qualify. Analysts expect these incentives to continue as companies work to rebalance demand, manage inventory and preserve momentum in the EV market.

Pricing Challenges and the Need for More Affordable EVs

Used EV prices have fallen to far more accessible levels, yet the number of budget-friendly new EVs remains limited. Dealers and analysts agree that expanding lower priced electric options, such as the upcoming return of the Chevrolet Bolt, will play a major role in rebuilding demand. Consumers consistently respond to vehicles that offer appealing value at mainstream price points.

Growing Interest in Hybrids and Changing Consumer Habits

Range anxiety and long charging times continue to steer many buyers toward hybrids and plug-in hybrids. These vehicles provide better fuel economy without requiring drivers to adjust their daily habits. Dealers are reporting noticeable growth in hybrid demand, driven by shoppers who want efficiency at a reasonable price. Analysts believe this trend reflects a broader shift in consumer expectations rather than a rejection of EVs. Shoppers are increasingly open to alternatives, provided that the price makes sense and the vehicle fits familiar routines.

Long-Term Outlook for EV Adoption

Industry experts do not expect the EV sector to fade. Automakers have already invested heavily in electrification and will continue refining their product lines to align with consumer preferences. Analysts predict that EV adoption will grow over time as pricing improves, more body styles become available and charging convenience continues to expand. Many believe the market is entering a transitional phase rather than a permanent downturn, and that affordability will be the key driver of future growth.

The Tesla Model Y

The Tesla Model Y has become one of the most popular electric vehicles because it blends great range, quick acceleration and practical, everyday usability in a way that resonates with a wide audience. It launched in early 2020 and quickly reshaped the EV landscape as drivers appreciated its roomy cabin, efficient powertrain and smooth driving experience. The vehicle stands out from other EVs because it offers access to Tesla’s extensive Supercharger network, simple software focused controls and frequent over the air updates that keep the car feeling modern long after purchase. The combination of performance, efficiency and tech is what keeps the Model Y at the center of many EV conversations today.

Bottom Line

The EV market is facing a short-term adjustment following the loss of the federal tax credit, yet it remains active and full of opportunity. Automakers are using creative incentives to keep EVs appealing, and several models are being offered at attractive lease and finance terms. Consumers are exploring hybrids and plug-in hybrids as they balance efficiency and convenience, while the industry works toward delivering more affordable electric options. The next chapter of EV growth will hinge on price, value and the ability of manufacturers to meet buyers where they are.

What Do You Think?

Do you believe automakers will drop prices again in December, or do you think current incentives are as good as they will get?

Have you noticed EV prices or APR offers changing at your local dealers since the tax credit expired?

The company first promised a gloriously blocky off-road truck before pivoting to a shockingly fun electric commercial truck. Amazingly, Bollinger even managed to kick off production. But things haven’t been so rosy for the company lately. According to a recent report, conditions within the Bollinger are rough, as employees have been laid off and others haven’t even gotten their paychecks.

Normally, a story like this wouldn’t pop up on my radar, but I was one of the fans of Bollinger Motors. I drove the company’s B4 electric trucks back in 2023, and they were honestly way more fun to drive than any delivery truck had any right to be. The B4 is a box truck that you could hoon!

I was also excited to hear that, against all odds, Bollinger actually brought the truck into serial production. Too many startups deliver nothing but vaporware, but true to Bollinger’s word, its trucks have actually delivered real goods in real life. Sure, Bollinger wasn’t building anything as cool as its original ideas, but I love a good Detroit underdog story. Sadly, what started as a story of triumph is now one of pain. According to both Crain’s Detroit Business and the Detroit Free Press, Bollinger has been struggling so much that suppliers and employees aren’t getting paid.

How We Got Here

It’s been a hot minute since we last talked about Bollinger, so let’s review how the company got here. This is what I wrote in my previous reporting:

Robert Bollinger founded Bollinger Motors in Hobart, New York [ten] years ago. At the time, Bollinger had ambitious plans, stating: “Trucks have had the same design flaws for a hundred years and someone needs to do something about it.” How ambitious are we talking about, here? Bollinger said he was going to build the “world’s first all-electric on- and off-road sport utility truck.” Now, keep in mind that this was before today’s popular electric trucks and SUVs hit the road, so this statement had impact. So, Bollinger announced an electric SUV and an electric pickup truck; from my B4 commercial truck first drive:

Bollinger’s truck ideas rose from a need. See, Bollinger’s enjoyed a colorful career working for Manhattan ad agencies before pivoting to an organic hair and skincare company then finally landing at co-founding a grass-fed cattle farm. While running the farm, Bollinger felt that there really wasn’t a truck out there that was both a practical farm vehicle and a fun off-road toy. This motivated Bollinger to fulfill a lifelong dream and he created Bollinger Motors with the idea of creating a heavy-duty Sport Utility Truck that got work done during the week and had fun on the weekends.

In 2018, the company moved to Ferndale, Michigan, to grow its team and take advantage of proximity near automotive suppliers, engineering talent, and potential manufacturing partners. A year later, Bollinger moved again to Oak Park, Michigan. Bollinger had been working on the B1 SUV and B2 Pickup for years. Development started with a team of engineers who lived with each other in a bunkhouse before the truck was first unveiled in 2017. Bollinger then missed its delivery targets multiple times as development continued. The company also briefly flirted with a panel van concept and chassis cabs.

Bollinger canned the B1 and B2 in 2022, disappointing the strong fanbase he built. But the company wasn’t really giving up. Instead of building a funky off-roader, Bollinger said, it was secretly working on a Class 4 commercial truck platform. This was because Bollinger had seen lots of interest for a Class 4 truck for local deliveries and landscaping. Demand was already there for a commercial truck, so Bollinger followed the money. That year, Mullen Automotive bought a controlling stake in Bollinger.

The Trucks Are Fun

The B4 truck also signaled a change in philosophy for Bollinger. The B1 and B2 were clean sheet designs intended to use as many bespoke components as possible. But the B4? It was designed to source as many components from other companies as possible. That way, Bollinger didn’t have to build an entire vehicle from the ground up. Everything from the truck’s cab, which comes from China, to its battery, which comes from Our Next Energy in Michigan, is thanks to an army of suppliers. The trucks are assembled right there in Michigan by Roush.

I also thought the trucks were a riot to drive:

The Bollinger B4 surprised me in how much it didn’t drive like a commercial truck. The Mcity proving ground was too small for me to really find the limits of the Bollinger trucks, but I got to do things with those trucks that I’d never try with my bus or any of the other trucks I’ve driven.

Out of the gate, I decided to punch the accelerator. The B4 moves like any other EV. It takes off with a satisfying kick of torque and the electric motor gets the speedometer rising way faster than you’d expect a commercial vehicle to go. I’m sure you’ve gotten stuck behind garbage trucks and the like at stoplights. Well, the B4 accelerates fast enough that it could be a garbage truck that is faster than you are between stoplights. The B4 is not “fast,” as in, it’s not going to pull your face’s skin back, but it’ll make a comparable diesel look like it’s sitting still. It’s fast enough that Bollinger tells me some customers want a power limiter so that drivers don’t have too much fun.

That quick dose of power is supported with surprisingly good handling. See, “handling” and “delivery truck” don’t tend to jive well. Try to go full lock and full throttle in a regular truck and you might have a bad day. Bollinger’s trucks have their center of gravity so low that the engineers actually encouraged going full lock while hard on the throttle. There was tons of body roll, sure, but the truck felt planted even when I was at full lock and pushing the truck harder and harder. The tires gave up traction long before the truck felt unstable.

I wouldn’t even drive a U-Haul truck as hard as I sent a Bollinger.

Everything seemed promising. Bollinger had businesses that wanted its trucks, and its trucks weren’t reinventing the wheel, just taking existing technology and packaging it well. In theory, it should have been successful!

A Bumpy Road

Well, as it turns out, my optimism might have been misplaced. Crain’s Detroit Business released a report on Monday that paints a depressing picture of the company:

Electric truck manufacturer Bollinger Innovations Inc. is facing dozens of complaints over unpaid wages and a new stack of lawsuits by suppliers seeking millions of dollars in past due payments — and the state of Michigan is among those with money on the line. The Oak Park-based startup, which promised in 2023 to invest $44 million and create 237 jobs in metro Detroit, is in default of its incentives agreement with the Michigan Economic Development Corp. The company was awarded $3 million by the state to help launch its Class 4 EV and has collected about a third of the cash.

[…]

As of Sept. 30, Bollinger had no qualified new jobs and 50 base employees, MEDC spokeswoman Danielle Emerson said. The company has laid off employees since then, Crain’s confirmed, though it is unclear how many. Company representatives did not respond to requests for comment.

Bollinger has until May 4 to cure the default by reaching job milestones and “will be required to pay back all or a portion of those funds” if it fails to do so, Emerson said. At the same time, the company is under investigation by the Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity, which has received 59 claims against the company about unpaid wages or benefits, department spokesperson Keely Lovern said.

It somehow gets worse. In March, Robert Bollinger–who stepped down as CEO before eventually leaving his company–sued Bollinger Motors for a $10 million loan he gave the company back in October 2024. This summer, the company claimed it was broke and sought help via recievership in June to pay back that loan. Since then, Crain’s writes, Mullen Automotive CEO and chairman David Michery paid Robert Bollinger back and promised to do the same for suppliers.

Post-receivership, Bollinger and Mullen were merged to create Bollinger Innovations. Unfortunately, it sounds like the money problems were never really solved, from Crain’s:

A half-dozen suppliers sued Bollinger earlier this year, demanding payment of more than $5 million in outstanding bills, Crain’s reported in July. Those cases have since been disposed, but six different suppliers are now suing the company in active cases, according to Oakland County Circuit Court records.

Canadian supplier Promark Electronics Inc., German supplier Thyssenkrupp AG, Brazilian supplier Metalsa, Livonia-based Testron Corp., Troy-based Engineering Technology Associates Inc. and California-based Aibond Corp. are the plaintiffs in those cases.

Bollinger Innovations was delisted from the Nasdaq a month ago after failing to meet its market value requirements. Michery tried to remain in compliance by conducting nine reverse stock splits in three years, but its share value continually fell below the $1 minimum. The company is trading stock on the open markets at 13 cents per share as of Monday afternoon.The company incurred a net loss of $304.4 million for the nine months ended June 30, according to the most recent financial statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in August. Its accumulated deficit at the time was $2.6 billion.

The Drive also wrote about this, quoting an anonymous tipster. That tipster claimed that payroll is weeks behind, there is no operating cash left in the company, and the company’s customers and dealers have no idea what’s actually going on. I have reached out to Bollinger for clarification and comment on its current condition.

It’s also unclear what this means for Bollinger’s future. The company wants to make a larger Class 5 truck called the B5. Robert Bollinger also isn’t giving up his electric pickup truck dream. But all of that is going to take money, and it seems Bollinger is struggling with that part right now.

I will update this story if I learn anything more. What’s most important, I think, is that everyone gets paid. Then, hopefully, Bollinger can get past this pothole and keep on trucking.

The U.S. Energy Department says there are “emergency conditions” that require the J.H. Campbell power plant to remain open to meet electrical demand in the central U.S. Otherwise, the government warned Tuesday, homes and businesses might go dark.

Critics scoff at that claim, and environmental groups and Michigan's attorney general have gone to court to try to overturn orders keeping the plant online.

“The costs of unnecessarily running this jalopy coal plant just continue to mount,” Earthjustice lawyer Michael Lenoff said.

The Campbell plant opened in 1962 near Lake Michigan in western Michigan’s Ottawa County. It can generate up to 1,450 megawatts of electricity to serve up to 1 million people.

Consumers Energy planned to close it May 31, but the Energy Department ordered it to stay open for three months, citing a need for reliable electricity during the hot summer.

That decision has since been extended twice, and the latest order lasts until Feb. 17.

Consumers Energy acknowledged Wednesday that it will continue operating the plant. The net expense through September was pegged at $80 million, which will be shared by customers who are part of a multistate electric grid, the utility said in a securities filing in October.

Nick Schifrin: Of course, the Trump administration has focused on rare earth minerals well beyond Saudi Arabia.
Nick Schifrin: Saudi officials insist they are not after a bomb and actually trust in U.S. nuclear umbrella, they don't want their own nuclear weapon.","Amna Nawaz:

President Trump and Mohammed bin Salman concluded the Saudi crown prince's visit to the U.S. today by speaking to more than 400 business leaders.

Beyond a defense agreement and talk of the kingdom's human rights record, the visit focused on joint U.S.-Saudi adventures, including extracting Saudi minerals critical to everything from fighter jets to cell phones, and helping Saudi Arabia build a civilian nuclear program.

Nick Schifrin is here to discuss that now.

So, Nick, let's begin with that deal over rare earth minerals. Why is that so important?

Nick Schifrin:

You just said it, Amna.

These rare earth minerals and magnets that are produced by them go into everything, from electric vehicles to the world's most advanced fighter jet, the F-35. And Saudi Arabia says that it has the fourth most valuable deposit of rare earth in the world.

But, right now, China has a near monopoly on what are known as heavy rare earths. They do 90 percent of the processing, and China produces 93 percent of all those earth magnets that are required for high-end manufacturing.

So the U.S. and Saudi Arabia have agreed that an American company, MP Materials, whose biggest shareholder right now is the U.S. government, in fact, will own just about half of a rare earth refinery in Saudi Arabia. The U.S. and Saudi will mine and process the rare earths, and then that will go to the U.S., Saudi, and its allies in order to produce those magnets.

In the long run, the idea here is to reduce U.S., reduce Western reliance on China, because we saw China withhold some of those rare earth magnets in the conversations with President Trump this year. It also taps into something that Saudi officials say, that they are looking for the next big oil giant, like Aramco, and that it might be there in rare earths.

So take a listen to Gracelin Baskaran of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Gracelin Baskaran, Center for Strategic and International Studies: Saudi Arabia is absolutely emerging as one of the biggest mineral superpowers. What we see here is actually one of the biggest heavy rare earth deposits in the world. And given that Saudi did have Aramco, it has a lot of the infrastructure needed to become a minerals production and processing superpower.

And, again, remember that the U.S.-Saudi relationship was built on natural resources. It was the oil for security agreement. So what we see of that is just the next era of that, going from oil to mineral.

Nick Schifrin:

Of course, the Trump administration has focused on rare earth minerals well beyond Saudi Arabia. It has made deals with Japan and Australia. There's a huge push to compete with China.

But, Amna, one study says that, even though the West is trying to make these strides on rare earth minerals, the West will still rely on China for 90 percent of heavy rare earths past 2030.

Amna Nawaz:

Ninety percent.

Meanwhile, there's another agreement on nuclear power technology. What has the U.S. agreed to there?

Nick Schifrin:

So, the secretary of energy, Chris Wright, announced this today. He had a signing ceremony with his counterpart and said that two countries have completed negotiations on civil nuclear cooperation.

And on FOX News, Wright described this deal exclusively as helping Saudi Arabia diversify its energy products, its energy sources by building a nuclear power plant.

Chris Wright, U.S. Energy Secretary:

This is just for civil nuclear construction of a power plant, American technology, American companies to build a very large nuclear power plant in Saudi Arabia. It's not about enrichment. It's not about anything related to weapons. It's just about generating electricity, secure, reliable, affordable electricity.

Nick Schifrin:

So you heard Wright say that it's not about enrichment, it's not about weapons.

But the negotiations that have led to this have very much been about enrichment, about Saudi Arabia's desire to make nuclear fuel perhaps inside Saudi Arabia. Saudi officials say that they have 7 percent of the world's uranium and in fact it's colocated with all those rare earths that we were just talking about, and that asking the kingdom to mine uranium in addition to those rare earths would kind of — without enriching, without creating the nuclear fuel, would be kind of like asking Saudi Arabia to get all of the oil out of the sand many years ago without refining the oil.

That's the kind of deal that they're trying to get. But the community that's been focused on nonproliferation has had their concerns about Saudi Arabia. They have been concerned that Saudi Arabia has resisted some of the monitoring and inspections that would go along with this kind of agreement. And, frankly, they have been concerned about Saudi intentions all along.

So take a listen to Henry Sokolski with the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center.

Henry Sokolski, Executive Director, Nonproliferation Policy Education Center:

They want a bomb option. I think they have been very clear privately to various contractors that I have been in contact over the years that that's the bottom line. I think that's the reason they have been insistent about getting enrichment, when it doesn't make economic or practical sense.

Nick Schifrin:

Saudi officials insist they are not after a bomb and actually trust in U.S. nuclear umbrella, they don't want their own nuclear weapon.

Nonetheless, Energy Secretary Wright said that today's deal has what he called — quote — ""bilateral safeguard agreements."" He hasn't spelled that out. One solution here, Amna, that I'm told is that American companies could do the enrichment inside the United States, and Saudi Arabia thinks that might be more economically viable than doing the enrichment in Saudi Arabia.

Amna Nawaz:

Meanwhile, interestingly, we heard President Trump say that the crown prince had actually pushed him on the issue of Sudan during this visit. What do we know about what was behind that crown prince's message?

Nick Schifrin:

So, Sudan has been driven by horrific violence for many years, but there's been an explosion of violence especially just in the last few weeks.

Here is some of it. We're blurring it, it's so horrific. The paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, or RSF, has been committing what the U.S. has labeled as genocide against non-Arabs in El Fasher in North Darfur. Thousands perhaps, tens of thousands are feared dead.

Beyond the humanitarian issues, Amna, Saudi Arabia has been very concerned that Sudan could spread, that instability in Sudan could invite terrorism into the region. And MBS pushed President Trump to confront this crisis, as Trump himself said today.

President Donald Trump:

His Majesty would like me to do something very powerful having to do with Sudan. It was not on my charts to be involved in that. I thought it was just something that was crazy and out of control. But I just see how important that is to you and to a lot of your friends in the room, Sudan. And we're going to start working on Sudan.

Nick Schifrin:

Saudi Arabia wants to see President Trump impose secondary sanctions on the United Arab Emirates, one of the RSF's most important external factors, and the RSF itself be labeled a foreign terrorist organization.

Amna Nawaz:

All right, Nick Schifrin, thanks, as always.

Nick Schifrin:

From its initial cohort of entrepreneurs, the organization has expanded to offer an eight-week core curriculum (BUILD Basics), followed by advanced growth-oriented tracks.
The announced pause at the end of 2025 signals a moment of reflection, both for the organization and for Detroit’s micro-business support network more broadly.
During the pause window, alumni-engagement and community mapping efforts may become more prominent, as BUILD looks to evolve its supporting architecture.
The Board’s decision invites the entrepreneurial ecosystem to reflect alongside BUILD: how might service-delivery evolve in a more resource-constrained environment?","In a significant turn for Detroit’s entrepreneurial ecosystem, the BUILD Institute announced that the organization’s Board of Directors has decided to pause operations at the end of 2025.

In a letter to its community, the board explained that it “recognize[s] that we are living in a time of great uncertainty for small business support organizations across Michigan.” The Board added that the pause offers “an opportunity to reassess how BUILD delivers on its mission, retool our programming, and evaluate new partnership opportunities and our overall business model to ensure long-term sustainability and impact.”

Since its founding in 2012 as part of the Downtown Detroit Partnership, BUILD Institute has become a cornerstone of inclusive entrepreneurship in Detroit. From its initial cohort of entrepreneurs, the organization has expanded to offer an eight-week core curriculum (BUILD Basics), followed by advanced growth-oriented tracks. Its mission focuses on under-represented and under-resourced community businesses, offering training, peer networks, mentorship, and access to capital.

The letter states that “in the coming months, we will continue all scheduled programming through December to ensure that all commitments to entrepreneurs and partners are honoured. During this time, we will also explore new ways to align our work with the evolving needs of our community, including our network of over 3,000 alums.”

To date, BUILD has graduated more than 1,700 participants in its classes, with over 560 businesses operational in Detroit, according to the organization’s impact reporting. In its 2023 “Our Impact” summary, BUILD reports that more than 1,700 graduates have generated approximately $56 million in annual labor income in the city; it further notes that for every dollar BUILD invests in an entrepreneur, an estimated $23.65 is added to the local economy through wages. The dataset also states that 83 percent of graduates are women and 63 percent people of color, with 73 percent coming from low-income backgrounds.

Beyond those headline figures, BUILD’s broader ecosystem has grown. Industry-reporting suggests that BUILD has supported over 2,600 aspiring and experienced business owners through its various programs; one article noted that its newer “BUILD Grow” and “Grow Evolve” programs — designed for businesses seeking to scale and systematize growth — are aimed at mature entrepreneurs who already have employees and revenue streams.

These programs underscore BUILD’s belief that entrepreneurship in Detroit is not only about start-ups but also about scaling neighborhood-based enterprises that often face invisible barriers to growth.

The announced pause at the end of 2025 signals a moment of reflection, both for the organization and for Detroit’s micro-business support network more broadly.

The board mourns no failure, but rather frames the decision as a strategic recalibration. It writes: “This moment offers us an opportunity to reassess… our overall business model to ensure long-term sustainability and impact.” By continuing scheduled programming through December, BUILD aims to uphold its commitment to current cohorts of entrepreneurs while it designs its next chapter.

This pause comes at a juncture when Detroit’s entrepreneurial landscape is evolving rapidly. While demand among neighborhood-based entrepreneurs remains strong, support organizations face rising costs, shifting funding landscapes and the need to demonstrate scalable impact in a more complex environment.

BUILD’s decision to pause — rather than simply wind down — gives it space to revisit key questions: how funding flows to micro-business providers; how programs can move beyond “launch” toward long-term sustainability; whether partner-led models can amplify reach; and how alumni networks can play a more active role in the ecosystem they helped build.

For entrepreneurs who have gone through BUILD’s programming, the news may come as a shock, but the board emphasized that the organization’s “network of over 3,000 alums” remains a focus.

The existing alumni base, composed largely of women and minority business owners, has often described BUILD as “like a family” — a community hub where shared experience, peer support and business advice extend beyond formal training. During the pause window, alumni-engagement and community mapping efforts may become more prominent, as BUILD looks to evolve its supporting architecture.

For the city of Detroit, neighborhood business owners remain anchors of commercial corridors: the coffee shops, storefront service firms, digital studios, makers and retail outlets that give life to blocks outside downtown’s marquee redevelopment zones.

BUILD’s mission has always been to support those “Main Street” value creators — those who often lack access to traditional capital, business advisory services or scaling support.

In practical terms, the pause means that BUILD will not admit new cohorts beyond the end of 2025, will close out or transition existing programs, and will spend the pause period exploring new program design, partnership structures and sustainable funding models. The Board’s decision invites the entrepreneurial ecosystem to reflect alongside BUILD: how might service-delivery evolve in a more resource-constrained environment? How might capital access, mentoring and peer networks be structured differently for scale-oriented micro-businesses? How might alumni themselves become co-creators of future support models?

The board closed its letter by inviting appreciation for the “team members and facilitators who have served Detroit’s entrepreneurs and supported BUILD’s mission since our founding in 2012,” and to engage questions via Hello@buildinstitute.org.

For many entrepreneurs, BUILD’s decision to step back, reflect, and redesign suggests that the strategy moving forward it to unlock a new wave of locally rooted business growth, one built on deeper networks, smarter capital access, and an ecosystem primed for long-term sustainability.",https://michiganchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/BUILD-Institute.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 21:00:29.691877

(AP) — The Trump administration has once again extended the life of a Michigan coal-fired power plant that was supposed to close last May as the utility Consumers Energy transitions to cleaner sources of electricity.

The U.S. Energy Department says there are “emergency conditions” that require the J.H. Campbell power plant to remain open to meet electrical demand in the central U.S. Otherwise, the government warned Tuesday, homes and businesses might go dark.

Critics scoff at that claim, and environmental groups and Michigan’s attorney general have gone to court to try to overturn orders keeping the plant online.

“The costs of unnecessarily running this jalopy coal plant just continue to mount,” Earthjustice lawyer Michael Lenoff said.

The Campbell plant opened in 1962 near Lake Michigan in western Michigan’s Ottawa County. It can generate up to 1,450 megawatts of electricity to serve up to 1 million people.

Consumers Energy planned to close it May 31, but the Energy Department ordered it to stay open for three months, citing a need for reliable electricity during the hot summer.

That decision has since been extended twice, and the latest order lasts until Feb. 17.

Consumers Energy acknowledged Wednesday that it will continue operating the plant. The net expense through September was pegged at $80 million, which will be shared by customers who are part of a multistate electric grid, the utility said in a securities filing in October.

The U.S. Department of Energy on Tuesday closed on a $1 billion loan to restart Constellation Energy’s 835-MW Crane nuclear unit in Pennsylvania. Constellation plans to sell power from the unit to Microsoft under a long-term contract.

Inspections of key components at the unit, formerly Three Mile Island Unit 1, and regulatory reviews are on schedule, Constellation said Tuesday. The Baltimore-based company expects to spend about $1.6 billion — about $1,916 per kilowatt — to restart the unit, possibly as soon as in 2027.

In 1979, Three Mile Island suffered a partial reactor meltdown in what is considered “the most serious accident in U.S. commercial nuclear power plant operating history, although its small radioactive releases had no detectable health effects on plant workers or the public,” according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Under the loan, Constellation will pay an interest rate of 0.375% a year over the current average yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States of comparable maturity, as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, the company said in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing.

Under the agreement, Constellation can borrow up to $1 billion through Sept. 15, 2030, according to the filing. The company must pay the loan back by November 2055.

“DOE’s quick action and leadership is another huge step towards bringing hundreds of megawatts of reliable nuclear power onto the grid at this critical moment,” Joe Dominguez, Constellation president and CEO, said.

The loan is part of the Trump administration’s effort to bolster nuclear power. It marks the first project to receive a concurrent conditional commitment and financial close under the Trump administration, DOE Secretary Chris Wright said in a press release.

The unit’s restart will help lower electricity costs, strengthen grid reliability and create over 600 jobs, Wright said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/yHLXiiZQYcFvPoHu1mPTuXb667gcvA_xTWFVpbXxk_w/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMTc3ODUxNTA5LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-11-19 19:58:47.896526

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Army Corps of Engineers have officially released a new Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule that aims to provide clarity and predictability under the Clean Water Act. This action is a significant development for American farmers, landowners, and businesses, addressing years of uncertainty surrounding federal water jurisdiction.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, joined by Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works Adam Telle, announced the proposed rule would, “establish a clear, durable, common-sense definition of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS) under the Clean Water Act.”

Key Changes in the Proposed WOTUS Rule

The new proposal introduces several key definitions and clarifications designed to streamline the regulatory process and empower state and tribal governments:

Tributary Definition: Jurisdictional tributaries must connect to traditional navigable waters directly or through features that provide predictable and consistent flow.

Wetlands: Wetlands must touch a jurisdictional water and hold water for a sufficient duration year after year to be regulated.

New Exclusions: The rule explicitly preserves and clarifies exclusions for certain ditches, prior converted cropland, and waste treatment systems, and adds a new exclusion for groundwater.

State and Tribal Authority: Clear regulatory guidelines are designed to strengthen state and tribal decision-making authority in protecting their local water resources.

Empowering Landowners and Advancing Cooperative Federalism

Administrator Zeldin emphasized the necessity of a practical, straightforward rule that supports both environmental protection and economic activity.

He stated, “When it comes to the definition of ‘waters of the United States,’ EPA has an important responsibility to protect water resources while setting clear and practical rules of the road that accelerate economic growth and opportunity. Democrat Administrations have weaponized the definition of navigable waters to seize more power from American farmers, landowners, entrepreneurs, and families. We heard from Americans across the country who want clean water and a clear rule. No longer should America’s landowners be forced to spend precious money hiring an attorney or consultant just to tell them whether a Water of the United States is on their property. EPA is delivering on President Trump’s promise to finalize a revised definition for WOTUS that protects the nation’s navigable waters from pollution, advances cooperative federalism by empowering states, and will result in economic growth across the country.”

This proposed rule reflects a commitment to protecting the nation’s navigable waters from pollution while reducing the regulatory burden on landowners and businesses. By establishing clearer lines of jurisdiction, the EPA and Army Corps aim to foster economic growth and empower local authorities, delivering a more transparent and effective approach to water regulation.

""Oregon faces escalating climate impacts, from record wildfires to extreme weather events that hit vulnerable communities hardest. Meanwhile, we must continue to make progress on our carbon pollution reduction goals and support reliable, affordable clean energy,” Kotek said in a statement.

The order directs agencies to assess their current plans and performance measures and update them as needed to implement recommended pathways from the Oregon Energy Strategy.

That report, required by a 2023 bill, said the state should pursue energy efficiency, clean electricity, electrification, low-carbon fuels and resilience as the least costly avenues to accomplishing Oregon's energy goals.

The Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) and the Environmental Quality Commission will modify the Oregon Clean Fuels program to expand the timeline for reducing carbon intensity levels from 37% by 2035 to 50% by 2040. DEQ will also look at how Oregon's Low-Carbon Fuels Standard program compares to other states' and adjust it as needed.

Kotek's order calls for agencies to work together to make it easier to implement energy projects by evaluating Oregon's land use, permitting and infrastructure for challenges that could be tying up the process.

The Oregon Department of Energy (ODOE) will work with the Public Utility Commission (PUC) and the Department of Land Conservation and Development (DLCD) to study red tape and construction holdups that could limit projects. ODOE will issue a report by September 2026.

An October executive order by Kotek pushed for solar and wind projects to be developed ahead of tax credits expiring in July 2026.

Kotek's new order also includes a goal of the state increasing its energy storage ability to eight gigawatts by 2045. Stored energy works as ""backup power"" and supports renewable sources.

Oregon currently has 500 megawatts of storage and is in the process of developing seven gigawatts, each of which is 1,000 megawatts.

Under the order, agencies must collaborate to promote programs aimed at increasing the number of clean energy jobs and companies in Oregon.

To do that, agencies will work on developing new partnerships between public and private entities.

ODOE, PUC and DEQ must file biennial reports outlining their plans and creating goals for carrying out the order. Public feedback will be taken on those reports, which will also say how much money the agencies may need beyond the 2027 to 2029 budget cycle.

The governor's office will oversee implementation of the order.","https://www.statesmanjournal.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/10/03/PSAL/75501219007-241003-gov-tina-kotek-media-event-4.jpg?crop=3942,2218,x0,y205&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-19 19:01:08.880184

The critical battleground from now to 2030 is downstream conversion – refining into lithium hydroxide or lithium salts, cathode precursor manufacture, and battery recycling.
With the advancement of AI and the need for data centres, as well as the need for energy storage capacity for solar and wind (renewables) energy via Battery Energy Storage Systems, will be key drivers moving forward.
“These initiatives are accelerating the transition to electric mobility and renewable energy, thereby increasing lithium demand” “These initiatives are accelerating the transition to electric mobility and renewable energy, thereby increasing lithium demand.
For example, Europe is accelerating its efforts to establish a self-sufficient lithium supply chain.","The downstream processing segment of the lithium market, encompassing the conversion of raw lithium into battery-grade lithium hydroxide and carbonate, is experiencing significant transformation.

This evolution is driven by technological advancements, geopolitical shifts, and increasing demand for electric vehicles (EVs), clean energy storage, and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), among others.

The critical battleground from now to 2030 is downstream conversion – refining into lithium hydroxide or lithium salts, cathode precursor manufacture, and battery recycling. The raw ore business will increasingly act as a feedstock commodity.

Lithium hydroxide is gaining prominence due to its suitability for high-nickel cathode chemistries, which are prevalent in advanced EV batteries. The market for lithium hydroxide is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23.51% from 2024 to 2029, reaching some 564.78 kilotons of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) by 2029.

In Western markets such as Australia, Canada, the US, and European Union, governments and OEMs are pushing for more domestic or regional processing to bolster supply security, manage carbon footprints, and capitalise on what is poised to become a high-value industry.

Market analysts flag that scaling active material processing is possibly the limiting factor in many value chains. And failure to do so will leave miners squeezed.

Recycling and direct lithium extraction (DLE) is set to become increasingly important. Participants in industry roundtables consistently cite DLE as a technology frontier that could reshape cost and environmental profiles — provided it can scale and prove reliable.

In 2030, PwC through its Strategy& network reports almost every second car sold will be a battery electric vehicle (BEV), leading to a demand increase for global batteries of 35%. Market growth is being driven by both increased BEV sales and increasing battery size per BEV.

Consequently, PwC says demand for the most relevant active materials, especially lithium, nickel, and graphite will grow steadily.

“We expect an increase from 400,000 up to 6,000,000 tons (by) 2030,” PwC reports.

Shifting dynamics

The economics of lithium are shifting from raw ore to chemicals and active materials. Analysis by PwC’s Strategy& shows the scale-up needed in active material processing is enormous – on the order of multiple magnitudes by 2030 – if Western regions want to localise battery value chains.

Global mining leaders agree another catalyst for the growth of the downstream lithium market will be the shift in government policy for many nations and their willingness to provide incentives for its advancement.

While China currently leads in refining capacity, other regions are making significant strides to enhance their domestic processing capabilities, ensuring a more diversified and resilient global supply chain.

As mentioned, governments and OEMs are pushing for domestic refining, recycling and cathode precursor capacity, and commercial players that secure both feedstock and processing will win the margin pool. Policy instruments (industrial subsidies, content rules, strategic investments) are poised to accelerate regional moves to capture more of the battery value chain.

One example of the emerging recycling segment is Livium’s (ASX:LIT) wholly owned subsidiary Envirostream recently extending its agreement with LG Energy Solution (KRX:373220) for the provision of lithium-ion battery recycling and disposal services for a further three years.

Envirostream will receive guaranteed volumes of end-of-life batteries, which LG retains the right to purchase black mass generated from the batteries. Speaking to Mining.com.au in September, CEO Simon Linge says a large contribution to the agreement extension was Livium’s performance in its duties, which has bolstered the contractual relationship.

“I think we’ve been able to prove that we have been able to support them through the last 18 months and we’re confident that this new agreement, we think, shows that they’re confident in our ability to do that for another three years,” Linge says.

According to Linge, LG plays an effective role in sourcing recalled batteries from the market, for Livium to recycle.

“They are at the back half of that or the back third of that recall program, but as you can imagine, you get an initial surge, and then it’s harder to get the last bit of the tail,” he adds.

“Wanting to extend the agreement just for that tail may go longer than they’d originally expected, but then the broadening of the agreement into non-recall batteries was really just a reflection of the relationship that we built.”

BESS case scenario

As renewables proliferate and electrification grows, Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) are also set to play a crucial role in a dynamic energy system by smoothing supply and demand peaks and helping defer the cost of grid expansion and upgrades.

Mining.com.au previously reported that BESS deployments in H1 2025 are up 58% over the first six months of 2024. The Department of Industry, Science and Resources (DISR) September 2025 Resources and Energy Quarterly, notes BESS growth is expected to be at almost 13% a year to 2027 driven primarily by its increasingly important role in electricity grids.

BESS is now also supplying electricity during high demand periods in addition to their existing role in providing grid auxiliary services. Capital is flowing to battery energy storage systems and cell production, but industry insiders tell this news service the pace of investment still falls short of the scale needed to meet some decarbonisation pathways.

That investment gap – and the divergence between announced projects and actually delivered capacity – is the reason downstream players (refiners, cathode makers, recyclers) must plan for serial bottlenecks and secure long-term offtake early, they say.

Chris Ackerman, Corporate Development for Q2 Metals (TSX-V:QTWO), tells Mining.com.au growth in the downstream lithium market is still being driven by EVs and, as mentioned, it appears growth here will continue – particularly as range increases and prices decline.

“But there are other disruptors that are emerging and vying for centre stage, as well. With the advancement of AI and the need for data centres, as well as the need for energy storage capacity for solar and wind (renewables) energy via Battery Energy Storage Systems, will be key drivers moving forward. BESS is needed to store renewable energy/energy grid storage,” Ackerman tells this news service.

Ackerman reiterates that lithium demand is primarily driven by battery applications, which should come as no surprise – somewhere in the 90% range.

“It is primarily associated with electric vehicle batteries which is a major and growing component – but larger grid applications in the form of BESS is poised to be a key growth area,” Ackerman tells this news service.

“Cell phones, laptops, drones – there are innumerable battery applications we use everyday. Rounding it out, there are various other industrial applications as well, whether alloying, glass or even medicinal.”

Some analysts believe a rebound may be on the horizon, fuelled by this renewed growth in EV adoption and clean energy storage. Although lithium prices remain difficult to predict, global lithium miners are once more betting big on the metal.

Brunswick Exploration (TSX-V:BRW) CEO Killian Charles notes, however, EV adoption is actually secondary to renewable power installation. Historically, developed nations had ample access to electric power while developing nations did not.

Renewables and access to electricity, he says, is the key driver in the growth of the market, adding that historically, developed nations have had ample access to electric power while developing nations did not.

“The extreme growth of solar power installation continues unabated. This causes electricity to be available in areas that typically have poor to no EV penetration due to weak or oversaturated grids,” Charles tells this news service from Canada.

“As we increase and unlock more electric power through renewable energy, we effectively scale up demand for lithium ‘products’ be it energy storage or EVs.”

“As we increase and unlock more electric power through renewable energy, we effectively scale up demand for lithium ‘products’ be it energy storage or EVs”

Broadly speaking, Brunswick’s CEO expects a market rebalancing to occur throughout 2026 and into 2027 followed by incentivised pricing in 2028 and beyond. This is largely driven by significant demand growth.

While much has been written about declining EV demand, he tells Mining.com.au this is largely a non-issue. EV sales may be down but so are car sales in general.

“EVs as a proportion of total car sales are still increasing (reaching 25% on a global basis) even if most of these sales are predominantly Chinese driven. Typically, bear markets for commodities are driven by very weak demand growth and, at times, reducing demand. This is not observed in the lithium market,” Charles continues.

“Demand is still forecasted to grow by 12% per annum over the next five years. This is a staggering amount and it remains the fastest growing commodity market.”

By 2030, he expects the market to start to mature. There have been major swings in lithium prices over the past 10-15 years and this has underscored the immaturity of the market where the addition of a single mine or single new battery plant can cause huge imbalances.

“By then, one would expect the overall size of the market to better absorb new assets on the supply or the demand side. Not to say there won’t be swings in the price but they will be considerably dampened,” Charles adds.

Supply chain realignments

China dominates global lithium refining, accounting for a substantial share of processing capacity. However, the US and Europe are making concerted efforts to develop domestic refining capabilities to mitigate reliance on Chinese supply chains. For example, North America is expected to process 59% of its lithium as hydroxide by 2034, up from 43% in 2024.

As Patagonia Lithium (ASX:PL3) Executive Chairman Phil Thomas explains to Mining.com.au, while the lithium market currently faces an oversupply, the trajectory points towards a potential deficit by the early 2030s.

This shift underscores the urgency for continued investment in lithium extraction, technological innovation, and strategic policy support to ensure a stable supply that meets the growing demands of the electric vehicle and energy storage sectors.

Thomas says China maintains its position as the dominant consumer of lithium, driven by aggressive EV production and energy storage initiatives. However, the US is increasing investment in domestic lithium production, exemplified by projects like Thacker Pass, and aims to reduce reliance on imports and strengthen the domestic supply chain.

The US Department of Energy’s 2024 review highlights the need for increased capacity in midstream and upstream sectors to support the growing demand for EV batteries. Thomas notes such government policies and incentives will help drive the sector’s growth.

“Policies like the US Inflation Reduction Act and the European Critical Raw Materials Act are providing financial incentives for EV production, raw material sourcing, and battery manufacturing,” Patagonia’s Executive Chairman continues.

“These initiatives are accelerating the transition to electric mobility and renewable energy, thereby increasing lithium demand”

“These initiatives are accelerating the transition to electric mobility and renewable energy, thereby increasing lithium demand. The US Government is converting debt to equity in some projects.”

Countries in Europe are accelerating battery manufacturing and localising supply chains to mitigate import dependencies, which Thomas says is spurred by stringent emissions regulations and green industrial policies.

For example, Europe is accelerating its efforts to establish a self-sufficient lithium supply chain. The European Investment Bank has pre-qualified Vulcan Energy (ASX:VUL) for up to €500 million in debt financing to support its lithium hydroxide production facility in Germany, which aims to produce 24,000 tonnes annually by 2026.

As reported by Mining.com.au, Vulcan has now appointed global technology company ABB (SWX:ABBN) as the main electrical contractor partner for the phase one Lionheart Project in Germany.

Under the contracts, ABB will be responsible for the design, engineering, manufacture, testing, and delivery of the electrical infrastructure systems for the project covering the lithium extraction plant, central lithium plant, and well sites with a combined value of €46 million.

Vulcan CEO Cris Moreno says ABB’s system will be the electrical backbone powering the Lionheart Project. The signing of the contract follows a memorandum of understanding entered into by the companies in April 2024. The partnership is designed to optimise processes, shorten delivery times, and reduce and improve cost performance.

Meanwhile in North America, St-Georges Eco-Mining (CSE:SX) and its partners are evaluating potential spodumene suppliers from across Canada, in relation to its lithium production pilot plant and other metallurgical initiatives.

The pilot plant is designed to produce lithium nitrate and potentially lithium hydroxide, along with various byproducts generated through the company’s proprietary processing technology. The company says several suitors have expressed interest in providing concentrate.

St-Georges’ consortium of partners – Coalia and LiOH Corp – has now received a first shipment of five tonnes of Canadian-sourced spodumene concentrate. Initial work and testing is underway, with received material already processed through the alpha-to-beta transformation stage.

Drivers of growth

In terms of growth, Patagonia’s Thomas reiterates that EV adoption, which is projected to account for 87% of global lithium consumption by 2030, will see regions like China, Europe, and India being dominant. Renewable energy storage will also be a driver of growth.

“Lithium-ion batteries are increasingly integral to energy storage solutions, facilitating the integration of intermittent renewable sources like solar and wind into the grid. This sector is anticipated to grow at a rate of 25% annually through 2030,” Thomas tells this news service.

He adds that battery innovation will contribute to the sector’s expansion. Advancements in battery technologies, such as solid-state batteries and high-nickel/cobalt chemistries, are driving demand for high-purity lithium compounds.

Advancements in refining technologies are enhancing efficiency and sustainability. Companies like Mangrove Lithium are developing modular platforms that directly convert lithium chloride into high-purity lithium hydroxide, reducing operational expenditures by up to 40% compared to conventional methods.

“These innovations aim to enhance energy density, reduce costs, and improve charging times, thereby supporting the broader adoption of EVs and energy storage systems,” Thomas adds.

The BESS is yet to come

Currently the cheapest energy source globally is solar power. While China dominates in solar installation, Brunswick’s CEO notes it remains a global phenomenon with 1GWh of solar power installed every 12 hours (down from 20 hours only 2 years ago) and is broadly mixed across Europe, Africa, and the Middle East.

“As electrical power becomes more available this increases society’s electrification and incentivises the population to invest in electrical products such as EVs and grid owners into storage capacity,” Charles tells Mining.com.au.

New technologies such as AI or robotics require an incredible new amount of electrical power and will also contribute to the sector’s growth, he adds.

Venari Minerals (ASX:ASE) CEO Matt Healy tends to agree. He says the rapid penetration of renewable energy into Western energy markets has resulted in excess electricity necessitating storage technology. Healy says for this reason, global BESS deployments in H1 2025 are up 58% over the first six months of 2024, making BESS the ‘dark horse’ of lithium demand.

As an example, in August this year GenusPlus (ASX:GNP) began construction at the Merredin Big Battery Project (pictured above), as part of Western Australia’s transition to clean energy for the Wheatbelt and Eastern Goldfields regions.

As a joint project between the privately held Atmos Renewables and Nomad Energy, the 100 megawatt/four-hour Merredin Big Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) is expected to be commissioned in October 2026.

With an estimated life of 25 years, the project will make $20,000 per year through the Merredin Battery Community Legacy. Construction is expected to create up to 70 jobs and five jobs in operation, with commitments to locally sourced employment and additional support for First Nations peoples.

“Grid-scale batteries play an important role in our clean energy transition, storing excess energy during the day and discharging it at night – helping to stabilise and strengthen our electricity grid”

Energy and Decarbonisation Minister Amber-Jade Sanderson says this project will add to the state’s reach in the battery sector, including government-owned batteries in Kwinana and Collie.

“Grid-scale batteries play an important role in our clean energy transition, storing excess energy during the day and discharging it at night – helping to stabilise and strengthen our electricity grid,” Sanderson says.

“Together with new transmission lines, wind, solar, and gas generation where needed, they are important elements of the energy grid of the future.”

The Merredin BESS is a part of the state’s larger scheme to implement more renewable energy projects across the region.

The winning strategies?

Downstream integration will play a significant part in the sector’s expected rise. Owning conversion and refining capability – or tight partnerships with refiners – is poised to move up the margin stack.

Cost and ESG leadership will also be a factor. PwC reports projects that combine low cash costs with credible water, community and emissions credentials will obtain premium access to responsibly oriented offtake partners and capital.

Meanwhile, S&P Global says portfolio optionality – flexibility to supply carbonate versus hydroxide, hard-rock versus brine streams, or to pivot feedstock into recycling when economics favours it will be a winning strategy.

Structured offtake, tolling, and hedging to smooth revenue and de-risk financing in volatile markets.

Looking ahead to 2030, the race is on for profitable scale and regional sovereignty. The lithium sector is unlikely to either revert to a simple boom nor settle into a low-value commodity grind.

Instead, industry sources agree it will bifurcate – a commodity-grade mining cohort supplying feedstock into an increasingly regionalised processing and cell-manufacturing map, and a downstream cohort — refiners, cathode makers, recyclers — that capture disproportionate value.

For investors and corporates, industry sources agree the imperative is clear – secure offtake and processing, demonstrate credible ESG performance, and plan for a volatile price path even as cumulative battery demand through 2030 remains transformative.

Those that can marry geology with chemistry, capital discipline with agile commercial models, and do so in a fractured, geopolitical supply landscape, are likely to lead the charge.

Bidirectional charging enables EV owners to send stored power back to their homes, businesses, and even a utility grid.

“As the impacts of the climate crisis become more severe, from stronger wildfires to more destructive storms, preparation and resilience are essential. Bidirectional charging allows electric vehicle owners to power their homes during a blackout or support the grid during peak demand. In effect, EVs can serve as a ‘mini power plant on wheels,’ helping families and communities maintain access to electricity during emergencies,” said Congresswoman Brownley. “Electric buses equipped with this technology can also supply power to schools, hospitals, and emergency operations centers during outages. Given these far-reaching benefits, my bill ensures this smart, innovative technology becomes more widely available throughout the United States.”

“Electric vehicle batteries can help keep the lights on and make electricity more affordable for everyone, even those who don’t own EVs,” said Ellie Cohen of The Climate Center, a climate and energy policy nonprofit. “To prepare for climate extremes from wildfires to floods, we should look to the batteries in our electric cars, trucks, and buses to avoid blackouts — not polluting fossil fuels. That’s why we support the Bidirectional Electric Vehicle Charging Act to make electricity cheaper and more reliable for millions of Americans.”

Background

To strengthen grid resilience and expand clean-energy solutions nationwide, the Bidirectional Electric Vehicle Charging Act would:

Direct the U.S. Department of Energy to develop a National Electric Vehicle Bidirectional Charging Roadmap.

Direct the U.S. Department of Energy to establish technical standards for EV manufacturers to ensure uniform bidirectional charging capabilities.

Require that all new electric vehicles manufactured beginning in 2029 be capable of bidirectional charging, unless exempted by the Secretary of Energy.

Direct the Federal Emergency Management Agency to require that state and local hazard mitigation plans incorporate bidirectional charging capabilities.

The Bidirectional Electric Vehicle Charging Act is endorsed by The Climate Center and Récolte Energy.

On November 17, 2025, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a proposed rule that would significantly narrow its regulatory authority over Waters of the United States (WOTUS). Under the new proposed WOTUS rule, EPA would effectively have jurisdiction only over relatively permanent waters and a smaller subset of directly connected wetlands.

The WOTUS definition outlines the geographic reach of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ and EPA’s authority under the 1972 Clean Water Act to regulate streams, wetlands, and other water bodies. As such, it has been reviewed in boardrooms, courtrooms, and government offices for over fifty years. Most recently, on May 25, 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its opinion in Sackett v. EPA. In Sackett, the Supreme Court determined that WOTUS are only (1) relatively permanent bodies of water, such as oceans, lakes, rivers, and streams; or (2) adjacent wetlands indistinguishable from those waters because of a continuous surface connection.

EPA frames its proposed WOTUS rule as “fully implementing” Sackett v. EPA and narrowing federal reach. Most importantly, the proposal:

Defines “relatively permanent waters” to include waters that are standing or continuously flowing year-round or at least during the wet season.

Narrows the definition of “tributary” to only include relatively permanent waters.

Codifies Sackett’s “continuous surface connection” language as it relates to wetlands by requiring the proposed WOTUS wetland to:

Abut a jurisdictional water; and

Have surface water at least during the wet season such that the wetland is effectively indistinguishable from the jurisdictional water.

If the rule is finalized as proposed, many seasonal streams, ephemeral channels, isolated wetlands, and interstate waters will be excluded from federal jurisdiction unless they meet the new “relatively permanent” and “continuous surface connection” tests. That likely means fewer Clean Water Act permits will be required for projects affecting those features. The proposed WOTUS rule will also require EPA to defer more frequently to states and tribes regarding decisions affecting waterways. EPA touts this as “cooperative federalism,” explaining that states and tribes will have more responsibility to decide whether and how to regulate waters no longer overseen by EPA.

Responses to the proposed WOTUS rule are mixed. Many in the regulated community — such as those involved in agriculture, development, and mining — are treating the proposed WOTUS rule as a win because they see it as more predictable and less burdensome. On the other hand, environmental groups argue that the proposed WOTUS rule weakens water quality protections beyond what Sackett requires, leaving wetlands and ephemeral streams unprotected and heightening risks to drinking water, habitat, and flood resilience.

Once the proposed WOTUS rule is published in the Federal Register, interested parties have 45 days to comment. EPA will consider these public comments before issuing a final rule.

Given the history of WOTUS, it is almost guaranteed the final rule will be challenged in court. EPA’s proposal signals another shift in the scope of federal Clean Water Act jurisdiction — and continued uncertainty for projects that interact with wetlands and streams. Project proponents should continue to consult early with counsel and technical experts to assess whether certain features qualify as WOTUS, what permits may still be required, and how best to navigate the shifting balance of federal, state, and tribal regulation.",https://www.swlaw.com/wp-content/smush-webp/2024/04/cropped-Favicon_310x310-32x32.png.webp,N,,2025-11-19 19:01:57.523658

Gov. Tina Kotek wants state agencies to move faster to address climate change, ensure more longterm renewable energy power that is cheap and reliable for Oregonians and fill in gaps from federal disinvestment from clean energy projects.

To do so, Kotek on Wednesday issued an executive order directing state agencies to speed up energy project permitting and processes to connect renewable energy to the state’s electric grid for the long haul.

She called on more than a dozen state land and natural resource agencies to collaborate on strategies by September 2026 that will lead to policy proposals for the Legislature to take up in 2027. They must advance the state’s target of reducing greenhouse gas pollution 50% by 2035 and 90% by 2050, as established in a 2021 executive order by former Gov. Kate Brown.

Agencies will provide quarterly progress updates, Kotek said.

In October, she ordered agencies to fast-track permitting and siting reviews and approvals before July 4, so projects eligible for the Inflation Reduction Act’s federal clean energy tax cuts can benefit before they expire. For wind and solar projects to receive up to a 50% credit, they must be finished by Dec. 31, 2027.

President Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans are phasing out those tax credits via the tax and spending law they passed this summer.

In her latest order, Kotek said agencies will create policies guided by the latest Oregon Energy Strategy, which prioritizes deployment of more solar, wind, geothermal and wave energy projects, energy storage projects, and energy efficiency policies. Those policies include cash incentives that make it more affordable to replace gas cars, buses, furnaces and appliances with electric ones, electrify heating and cooling systems and make homes and businesses more energy-efficient and comfortable in hot or cold weather.

The plan also calls on reforming project siting and permitting for electrical grid upgrades and transmission corridors, making analysis, review and comment periods faster and opening up more state land for such projects.

A recent investigation from Oregon Public Broadcasting and ProPublica found the Northwest is woefully behind other parts of the country in adding new sources of renewable energy, because Oregon and Washington have left most of the grid transmission work to the federal Bonneville Power Administration. The administration has left parts of the region’s grid without updates for nearly a century, and the agency has been glacial in deploying and integrating new energy projects, the investigation found.

Kotek said at a news conference Wednesday afternoon that she wants BPA leaders to make good on promises they made when she took office to collaborate with the state on its energy future.

“I’m going to keep pushing BPA for grid enhancements, and pushing back on BPA on poor upgrades,” she said. “BPA needs to be a better partner.”

The state energy strategy also calls for the state to add 8 gigawatts of energy storage by 2045 — about 50% more than currently exists. But Kotek said nearly 7 of those gigawatts are already planned for development, enough to power roughly 5.8 million homes.

Agency collabs

The Department of Environmental Quality and the three-member Public Utility Commission will work together to ensure revenue collected by the utilities through the state’s Clean Fuels Program is invested in strategic areas. Those include transportation electrification and infrastructure in low-income communities, at multifamily housing sites and areas lacking commercial EV chargers.

The Clean Fuels Program requires fossil fuels suppliers, such as Chevron and Exxon Mobil, to gradually reduce the carbon dioxide emissions from the fuels they sell in Oregon until they’ve cut emissions at least 37% by 2035. Clean fuels producers in the program, such as companies installing electric vehicle charging stations, can earn carbon credits from DEQ and sell them to fossil fuels producers to help offset some of their emissions.

Kotek is also calling for the carbon intensity of fuels to be reduced 50% or more by 2040. This means they must switch to or blend into their products biofuels — such as corn ethanol and fuels made with food waste — or switch to other fuels that emit less carbon dioxide when burned, providing hydrogen or electricity for traditional gas vehicles.

She directed the Department of Administrative Services to buy zero-emission vehicles for state agencies and report to the governor at the end of each year on why it bought or leased any new combustion-engine vehicles.

The Department of Land Conservation and Development will research and propose changes to state land planning goals and regulations to boost clean energy development and create more transmission corridors on public lands.

Given budget constraints, including a deficit of at least $63 million during the next 18 months according to the latest state revenue forecast, Kotek said she expects agencies to “do what they can with existing resources” and to identify funding challenges and needs for the next two-year budget cycle.",https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/solarwind2025.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 19:01:05.052401

But they are likely to face stiff opposition from petrostates such as Saudi Arabia and others who are dependent on fossil fuels.
“Not only is [the divide] binary, but it is two extremes: one very favourable [to a phaseout] the other very unfavourable.
Some oil-producing countries oppose the fossil fuel phaseout, but so do some consumer countries.
“They have to decide by themselves how they interpret the transition [away from fossil fuels],” he said.","Oil-producing countries need to acknowledge the rise of clean energy, and rich countries will have to provide more assurances on finance if the chasm between negotiating nations at Cop30 is to be bridged, the president of the summit has said.

André Corrêa do Lago, the veteran Brazilian climate diplomat in charge of the talks, said: “Developing countries are looking at developed countries as countries that could be much more generous in supporting them to be more sustainable. They could offer more finance, and technology.”

This does not necessarily involve an increase in the headline amount of money to be provided directly from rich world coffers, set last year at $300bn (£230bn) a year by 2035. It could also come from better use of existing finance, Corrêa do Lago added.

“You don’t need more money. You don’t need public money from developed countries. You need to leverage more dollars from each dollar that you have,” he said in an exclusive interview with the Guardian as the talks entered their crucial stage.

“They can offer not only more resources in banks, in multinational development banks; put more public money in funds like the green climate fund or the global environment facility, but there are an increasing number of alternatives like debt-for-nature swaps and other [instruments].”

The divide over the “transition away from fossil fuels” has emerged as the biggest faultline at the Cop30 talks, now entering their final days in Brazil. On Tuesday, more than 80 countries demanded a roadmap to the transition as a key outcome of the summit, in what some campaigners described as a “turning point”.

But they are likely to face stiff opposition from petrostates such as Saudi Arabia and others who are dependent on fossil fuels. Decisions at “conference of the party” meetings require consensus, so even a handful of states could scupper the roadmap proposal.

“Not only is [the divide] binary, but it is two extremes: one very favourable [to a phaseout] the other very unfavourable. There aren’t many countries that are indifferent,” said Corrêa do Lago.

But countries could still come together, he added. “Like most of these negotiations, it is less binary than it looks,” he said, if countries could recognise their own internal contradictions, and face up to the global need for climate action.

Some oil-producing countries oppose the fossil fuel phaseout, but so do some consumer countries. “Some countries, because oil is a very important source of revenue, and other countries because they evaluate that they still need to use coal for more years, have shown very clearly that this proposal is not acceptable to them,” Corrêa do Lago said.

Oil-producing countries also had hard truths to face up to. “They have to decide by themselves how they interpret the transition [away from fossil fuels],” he said. “They are already doing it. There is one statistic that shows that the use of oil will be reduced inevitably in the years ahead. [Electric vehicles are] reducing significantly the demand for oil, for gasoline and diesel.”

He urged all countries to examine their future in the context of the climate crisis. “All countries could engage in this exercise, which is to find its own path to transition towards net zero, which is what we have committed to,” he said.

Countries can get over their internal contradictions, and take action on the climate in spite of them, according to Corrêa do Lago. Brazil embodies this: the country has recently become a major producer of oil and gas, but its president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has repeatedly insisted, at Cop30 and the summit of world leaders in Belém that preceded it, on the need to “move away from dependency on fossil fuels”.

Countries should face up to these opposing internal forces rather than try to hide them, Corrêa do Lago urged. “This Cop is happening in a country that is at the same time a nouveau oil producer and exporter, and the champion of renewables.

“The country where you have the largest tropical forests in the world and the country that has the largest meat producer in the world. Brazil is a microcosm of the world: we have many successes, and we still have great challenges [with poverty] and many things to do to improve the life of our population. We understand the challenges of wealth and the challenges of poverty. [Brazil] reminds us that every country in the world has contradictory circumstances.”

Lula is expected to return to Belém on Wednesday in an attempt to draw conflicted countries together. Corrêa do Lago said this would be done by listening to all countries’ concerns. “Brazil doesn’t want to do a top-down negotiation – Brazil wants to hear from countries which solutions they propose,” he said.

Corrêa do Lago is a pragmatist, a climate diplomat since 2002 who believes the annual talks must evolve fast to keep up with the speed at which global heating is altering the planet. Arguments over the precise wording of promises and resolutions that have been rehearsed many times before can distract countries from the need to pursue action in the real world, he says.

“The sense of urgency is what drove us to insist on implementation, because I think at this stage it’s irrelevant to be right. What is relevant is really to advance and make progress in implementation,” he said.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32ca8f77e6f90cb7a652721ad8150de660cc433c/620_0_2813_2250/master/2813.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=085c4863eb48f04c4f3ae883c89ecf77",N,,2025-11-19 19:58:42.723626

CCME Executive Director Charles McConnell delivered the presentation “Energy Transformation: Winds of Change,” emphasizing the essential role of engineering, carbon management, and execution excellence in enabling lower-carbon energy systems and sustaining industrial competitiveness. CCME’s involvement reflected the Forum’s central message: the success of the energy transition depends not only on technological innovation, but also on the effectiveness of project financing, contracting, and execution.

Notable sessions were held on such topics as EPC risk allocation, modularization strategies, supply-chain resilience, and the integration of carbon capture into large-scale industrial assets. These discussions underscored the growing need for practical, scalable solutions that balance cost, performance, and emissions reduction and reinforced the importance of disciplined project development, an approach that aligns closely with CCME’s research priorities and its ongoing collaborations with industry partners.

Zhiyuan Li, UH PhD student in Petroleum Engineering, also represented CCME and engaged with EPC executives, technology developers, and project managers throughout the event. “The Forum offered a valuable perspective on how engineering decisions, economic considerations, and carbon-reduction objectives converge in real project execution,” Li said. “It was insightful to see how CCUS and low-carbon technologies are evaluated not only technically, but also in terms of schedule certainty, supply-chain complexity, and contracting strategy. The discussions also highlighted how diverse industries—from surface-facility engineering to data centers to pump manufacturers—play interconnected roles in enabling large-scale carbon-management solutions.”

For CCME, the event was a great opportunity to gain an important perspective on how industry views first-of-a-kind (FOAK) low-carbon deployments. Discussions at the Forum emphasized the need for stronger partnerships between technology developers, EPC firms, and research institutions to reduce risk and accelerate commercial adoption. These insights align directly with CCME’s mission to serve as a bridge between academic research and industry implementation, ensuring that carbon-management technologies are both scientifically robust and commercially deployable.

“The loss of federal funding for clean energy projects threatens much needed years of progress toward a more sustainable future,” he said.","Hawaii’s Legislature may want to consider offering new state tax-credit funding for renewable energy expansion to at least partially offset federal withdrawals.

That was a suggestion made to a pair of state Senate committee chairs during a briefing last week about negative impacts on Hawaii climate change mitigation initiatives due to recent federal policy changes and funding pullbacks.

Leah Laramee, coordinator of the Hawai‘i Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Commission, told Sens. Karl Rhoads and Mike Gabbard at the Nov. 3 briefing that it would be incredibly helpful if more local tax credits were made available for renewable energy and climate change impact mitigation projects in the face of federal cutbacks driven by the administration of President Donald Trump.

Laramee told the senators that about $651 million in Hawaii renewable energy projects are at risk due to federal policy and funding changes.

“It’s a significant investment that is threatened in the state,” she said. “The loss of these projects is going to have pretty significant impacts on our ability to produce affordable energy locally and impact our energy security.”

In recent weeks, the administration of Gov. Josh Green has rolled out state emergency funding programs to help low-income households in Hawaii pay for rent, utilities and food to counteract federal program cuts due to the government shutdown. Most recently, the state Department of Transportation offered to pay federal air traffic and security workers to avoid curtailing flights at Daniel K. Inouye International Airport in Honolulu by 10%.

Though the loss of federal financial support for renewable energy isn’t on par with shutdown-related emergency responses, Hawaii residents and businesses pay the highest electricity rates in the nation. The threat of rising sea levels on the local economy also makes climate change impact mitigation a high priority for state leaders.

Some of the $651 million in threatened Hawaii renewable energy projects cannot be offset by state funding, such as a planned offshore wind farm where federal officials have ceased regulatory approval action. But state funding could counter canceled federal support for other things including electric vehicles, rooftop solar systems and “carbon smart” food production.

Laramee told Rhoads and Gabbard, who respectively chair the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Committee on Agriculture and Environment, that one of the biggest federal grant losses for Hawaii was $249 million from a $3 billion nationwide U.S. Department of Agriculture program called Carbon Smart Commodities.

The program supported climate-friendly agricultural projects including development of food forests, invasive species management and soil health improvement.

“This is really about food security within the state, and that’s been rescinded,” Laramee said.

Another move earlier this year rescinded a $62.5 million federal grant used to make low-cost loans for low- and moderate-income households to pay for rooftop solar systems.

This Solar for All program was being operated by the Hawai‘i Green Infrastructure Authority, but was terminated in August by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

Hawaii along with nearly two dozen other states filed lawsuits in October challenging EPA’s rescission of grant funding approved by Congress. Laramee said she was optimistic that the state will prevail, and encouraged the Legislature to keep up support for the state Office of the Attorney General, which is involved in numerous lawsuits over federal policy and funding changes.

Laramee also suggested that loan repayment revenue received by the Green Infrastructure Authority be recycled to fund more loans instead of being deposited into the state’s general fund.

The briefing held by Rhoads and Gabbard also covered ongoing efforts to invest in plans and projects that make Hawaii more resilient to rising sea level and temperatures — efforts that include pending litigation by the City and County of Honolulu against major oil companies that the Trump Administration has tried to upend.

Retired Hawaii Supreme Court justice Michael Wilson urged state leaders to develop a climate protection plan for the islands. Such a plan, he told Rhoads and Gabbard, could start with guarding against the loss of Waikiki Beach, which Wilson said stands to be submerged in 40 or 50 years based on the present rate of global warming impacts and would sap $2 billion of annual visitor spending.

After the briefing, Rhoads (D, Nuuanu-Downtown-Iwilei) said in a statement that the presentations by Laramee and Wilson were a sobering reminder that climate change isn’t a distant or abstract issue, and that it directly impacts the health, safety, and economic future of Hawaii residents.

“Our responsibility as lawmakers is to take proactive measures to protect our communities and uphold the rights of future generations to a safe and sustainable environment,” Rhoads said.

Gabbard (D, Kapolei-­Makakilo-Kalaeloa) said in a statement that now is the time to “double down” on the commitment by Hawaii leaders to renewable energy, local food security and climate adaptation to safeguard our islands.

“The loss of federal funding for clean energy projects threatens much needed years of progress toward a more sustainable future,” he said.

Poorly crafted federal preemption and blanket moratoriums on state AI laws in the absence of federal standards are dangerous approaches.","Introduction and summary

On November 17, 2025, House Republican leaders were reported to be actively considering preemption of state AI laws, with an eye on the National Defense Authorization Act as the possible legislative vehicle.1 President Donald Trump took to Truth Social the next day to amplify the message, claiming that AI investment has made the U.S. economy the “hottest” in the world—despite current economic realities2—and that state overregulation threatens to derail this supposed growth.3 This renewed push comes on the heels of a failed attempt by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX)4 to insert a dangerous5 and overreaching6 moratorium on state laws regulating AI into the Senate budget reconciliation package, the Big Beautiful Bill (BBB).7 While the BBB did pass,8 senators ultimately voted 99-1 to strike the state AI law moratorium from the bill.9 The moratorium ultimately failed due to serious drafting flaws and procedural issues,10 including efforts to contort the proposal to meet Senate reconciliation rules and the use of vague language by Sen. Cruz’s team that expanded the provision’s reach11 beyond what it publicly claimed.12 Despite the removal of the moratorium from the BBB, federal preemption proposals or temporary moratoriums on state AI laws remain a critical legislative policy discussion. Such actions remain a top priority for the AI industry13 and the Trump administration, which mentions fears about “states with burdensome AI regulations” in its AI Action Plan.14 For the largest tech firms, the goal is not simply regulatory clarity but also to help shape a more permissive legal environment for AI development and deployment.15 Influential AI policy thinkers on the right also continue to refine and promote the idea of a federal moratorium.16 Critically, the proposal for a federal moratorium on state AI laws failed17 not because almost all U.S. senators oppose a ban on state AI laws but due to the circumstances of how it was crafted to meet the rules of reconciliation. Sen. Cruz has already pledged to reintroduce the proposal elsewhere and included in his September 2025 release of “A Legislative Framework for American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence,”18 alongside his proposed SANDBOX Act,19 to allow the suspension of any federal rules and regulations AI companies identify as inhibiting their ability to develop and deploy AI.

In this report, the author uses the term “reconciliation moratorium” to refer specifically to the House and Senate versions of a moratorium on state AI laws that were introduced as part of the BBB, with the understanding that if a moratorium had passed, it would have blocked most AI laws in any state it applied to.

With a legislative proposal on federal preemption or a moratorium on state AI laws likely to return, it is critical that Congress recognize the public safeguards states provide and the risk such interventions could pose to entrench industry power by undermining state regulatory authority. Rather than blocking state action, lawmakers should focus on setting a strong federal floor of protections, including prohibitions on the most dangerous uses of AI, while preserving state authority to go further in addressing new harms. At a minimum, any effort to limit state laws should be subject to extended deliberation that fully considers the tradeoffs and ensures that any preemption is paired with meaningful and enforceable federal protections.

Background on the reconciliation AI moratorium fight

The reconciliation AI moratorium was first introduced20 in the House21 as a standalone provision that would apply nationwide and included a narrow exemption for criminal laws. Sen. Ted Cruz later introduced a nearly identical version in the Senate that also applied broadly to all state and local AI laws and omitted the criminal law exemption.22 Although Cruz’s version made a passing reference to Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) funding, it was still functionally standalone in its scope and effect.23 This “standalone” structure meant that the ban would take effect as binding federal law regardless of whether a state accepted the new BEAD funds. After the Senate parliamentarian raised concerns,24 Cruz revised the language25 to tie enforcement more explicitly to BEAD-related funding. However, as CAP explained at the time,26 the revised text still applied a blanket ban on state and local AI regulation and extended enforcement beyond just the $500 million addition, likely implicating the full $42.5 billion BEAD program. Continued backlash over that ambiguity led to another revision27 and a five-year compromise28 amendment cosponsored by Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN).29 Sen. Blackburn ultimately opposed her amendment and the AI moratorium due to concerns about the provision’s real-world impact, stating, “This provision could allow Big Tech to continue to exploit kids, creators, and conservatives. Until Congress passes federally preemptive legislation like the Kids Online Safety Act and an online privacy framework, we can’t block states from making laws that protect their citizens.”30 Senators ultimately voted 99-1 to strike the AI moratorium31 from the BBB before passing it.32

Federal preemption—including temporary moratoriums—of state AI laws is a nightmare to craft and enforce

Proposals to block state AI laws are likely to return. Some may mirror the reconciliation moratorium by relying on temporary bans or tying restrictions to funding. However, if revived, those efforts would likely fall outside the confines of budget reconciliation legislation and require 60 votes in the Senate to pass, necessitating bipartisan cooperation. Other proposals may take a different route and pursue permanent federal preemption of state AI laws. While both approaches aim to restrict state power, they operate differently in law. Federal preemption replaces state statutes with federal ones under the supremacy clause, while a moratorium only pauses state authority for a limited time without permanently nullifying existing laws or requiring a federal standard in their place.

Federal preemption of state laws is not unprecedented and can be appropriate in some cases, but well-structured examples are narrowly tailored and often paired with strong federal protections. In climate policy, the Clean Air Act provides a model where federal standards establish a baseline and states retain the authority to adopt stronger protections.33 Several efforts in the broader tech policy space illustrate how preemption can be structured more thoughtfully. In recent years, proposed federal legislation to address data privacy—the American Data Privacy Protection Act34 and the American Privacy Rights Act35—sought to establish comprehensive federal privacy standards by preempting only certain state privacy laws36 while preserving others that reflect consumer protections and civil rights.37 Proponents of preemption of state AI laws frequently point to38 the Internet Tax Freedom Act (ITFA),39 which narrowly and clearly preempted state taxation on internet access. However, the reconciliation moratorium shared little in common with ITFA’s targeted scope. ITFA addressed a well-defined activity, taxation, with explicit guidelines and a sunset provision.

While the reconciliation moratorium was not structured as federal preemption in the traditional sense, its practical effect would have mirrored a broad preemption regime by overriding state authority across a wide range of policy domains. What made this especially dangerous is that, unlike traditional preemption frameworks, the moratorium offered no federal protections in return. It did not establish minimum standards, create oversight mechanisms, or provide any substantive safeguards for the public. Because of this, it is useful to examine the moratorium as a case study of how poorly scoped federal interventions in state authority—whether through federal preemption or temporary moratoriums—can undermine effective governance and generate legal confusion.

The reconciliation moratorium sought to broadly prevent states from regulating entire classes of AI applications across sensitive and diverse sectors such as employment, health care, housing, and elections—many of which are areas in which states have significant equities and long histories of promulgating regulations—for a period of five or 10 years. A decade-long freeze on state AI laws is also excessive by any measure. Ten years ago, there were no transformer models and no large language models, and there was no public understanding of how AI could reshape communication, labor, or information ecosystems. Since then, the field has seen the rapid rise of large-scale language models and the early development of AI agents capable of acting with increasing autonomy across digital environments. Now, leaders in the tech industry are publicly projecting that40 artificial general intelligence could emerge within the very decade that the reconciliation moratorium would have shut states out of legislating. Even the revised five-year compromise amendment41 introduced by Sens. Cruz and Blackburn, while slightly less extreme, would have still posed serious risks. That is because any attempt to suspend state authority in this fast-evolving space, whether for five years or 10, is dangerous if not paired with a federal floor of basic safeguards.

The reconciliation moratorium attempted to prohibit state and local governments from not only passing new laws or regulations that “limit,” “restrict,” or “regulate” AI but also from enforcing existing ones for the duration of the ban, while allowing those laws and regulations that “facilitate” AI. Although the exact phrasing varied slightly, the terms “regulate” and “facilitate” appeared consistently across the versions introduced in both the House and Senate. Efforts to block only restrictive AI laws while allowing those seen as supportive made the provision especially difficult to interpret, which in turn would have made consistent enforcement nearly impossible. A blanket moratorium that banned all state AI laws, whether they limit or facilitate AI, would have been more straightforward to administer. This highlights the core challenge with overriding state authority in this space because there is no approach that is both simple and neutral if it comes at the cost of eliminating the ability of states to respond to rapidly changing risks, and applies not only to future legislation but also to existing laws.

The definitions used in the reconciliation moratorium were also deeply flawed. Terms such as “AI system,” “model,” and “automated decision system” were written so broadly42 that they could apply to virtually any computational tool.43 Whether these ambiguities were intentional or accidental remains unclear. What is clear is that such ambiguous language invites lawsuits and regulatory paralysis, particularly because the reconciliation moratorium allowed private entities, not just the federal government,44 to bring enforcement actions. As a result, states would face the risk of being tied up in costly litigation for years, unable to advance legislation without legal challenge.

Even if a future AI moratorium were rewritten to limit enforcement to the federal government, it would create a different kind of barrier. States would be forced to seek clarity or approval from the government before acting, placing them in a constant position of uncertainty. This would function less like guidance and more like a de facto preclearance system, where state lawmakers hesitate to act out of concern that federal officials could later reinterpret compliance standards or that a change in administration could bring a different view of what is allowed, putting previously lawful state efforts in jeopardy.

Another key concern arises when there is no exemption for criminal laws. The House version45 of the reconciliation moratorium included a carve-out to preserve states’ ability to enforce their criminal codes, but the Senate version removed that protection. Without an exemption for criminal laws, states would be blocked from prosecuting serious AI-related crimes. For instance, Utah recently enacted H.B. 0238,46 a law that expands the definition of child sexual abuse material to explicitly include AI-generated imagery. Under the Senate’s version of the reconciliation moratorium, laws such as H.B. 0238 could have been preempted. This omission could have interfered with efforts to protect children and to address a range of AI-enabled criminal activity, including identity fraud, election interference, and the production of nonconsensual or exploitative synthetic media.

Constitutional concerns

Beyond the practical flaws of the reconciliation moratorium, a ban on state AI laws raises serious constitutional questions. Under the Tenth Amendment, powers not explicitly delegated to the federal government remain with the states. This means that states possess core authorities such as running elections, regulating state courts, setting the rules for the administration of their own state government, licensing professionals, and protecting public health and safety. The reconciliation moratorium did not carve out exceptions for these areas. Instead, it unconstitutionally imposed a sweeping prohibition that would have invalidated all forms of state AI laws that sought to restrict AI. For example, it would have prevented state legislatures from setting rules on how their own judiciaries use AI to draft opinions or review filings, an issue squarely within state control.

Many of the first laws governing AI have emerged in precisely these domains. States have already adopted laws specifically targeting AI use to ensure the integrity of their elections.47 For example, Minnesota and Texas ban48 the use of political deepfakes within certain timeframes before an election. In regulating courtroom practices, states have also taken steps to protect their courts from AI-related abuses. Texas’ 30th District Court, for instance, requires legal filings to include an “AI certificate”49 confirming that AI tools were not used to fabricate evidence or citations. The text of the reconciliation moratorium arguably would have preempted those statutes in ways that infringe on state sovereignty, removing state control over their internal operations and undermining their constitutionally protected role.

The push for a moratorium or preemption is industry-driven

Large AI companies and their trade associations50 have called for federal preemption of state AI laws in their submissions to the White House’s AI Action Plan51 as documented in the public AI Action Plan database.52 Following these requests, Big Tech companies and their trade groups53 supported and lobbied for the moratorium’s inclusion in the reconciliation bill.54 The reconciliation moratorium reflects this effort, aligning closely with industry demands.

Support for preemption or a moratorium is not limited to large companies. Some smaller AI firms, including signatories to letters submitted to the AI Action Plan,55 have voiced concerns about the cost and complexity of complying with different state laws. While these concerns may not be baseless, it would be misleading to suggest that a moratorium would primarily benefit smaller players. Large technology companies would stand to gain just as much, if not more. These larger players have the resources to manage a patchwork of state laws, but they see compliance with them as a burden that slows development and limits their freedom to deploy systems on their own terms. That is why they are likely demanding preemption not solely out of principle or concern for startup burdens, but because regulatory friction threatens their market dominance. Preemption would reduce the scrutiny they face at the state level and shield their models and practices from accountability. It is crucial, then, that in any debate over federal preemption, it is clear who is asking for it, who stands to gain, and what will be lost if states are pushed out of the AI governance space.

State leadership should be protected

The United States still lacks comprehensive federal laws governing AI and privacy. In response, states have stepped forward to begin to protect their residents. Many lawmakers acted swiftly, drawing lessons from Congress’ failure to pass meaningful privacy legislation despite years of debate. They understood that delay at the federal level often means no safeguards at all. Rather than wait, states, which have long been the laboratory of American democracy, advanced laws that promote transparency, prevent abuse, and restrict dangerous uses of AI in sectors such as employment, housing, and health care.

That same balance should guide federal AI policymaking. While the single best way to regulate AI may not yet be known, it is clear that doing nothing is not the answer.

These state efforts are critical because they allow for policy experimentation, developing best practices that can later inform federal legislation. States are uniquely positioned to respond quickly to emerging harms and to tailor policy to local needs. Across policy areas, states have taken a range of approaches that reflect their local priorities and levels of risk tolerance. Some, such as Utah, have opted for light-touch models such as regulatory sandboxes that allow innovation while monitoring outcomes. Others, such as Colorado and California, have passed more comprehensive AI accountability laws that establish transparency and oversight mechanisms.56 In climate policy, California used the authority preserved for the states under the Clean Air Act to adopt stronger protections57 and lead on vehicle emissions policy, including the Advanced Clean Cars and Advanced Clean Trucks programs. Until recently, those policies were backed by a federal waiver, which enabled California to impose stricter standards than the national baseline and have since been adopted by more than a dozen other states.58 That same balance should guide federal AI policymaking. While the single best way to regulate AI may not yet be known, it is clear that doing nothing is not the answer. Allowing multiple approaches from states to coexist increases the chances of identifying what works, what needs adjustment, and what should be scaled nationally. That flexibility is especially important in a field such as AI, where the technology evolves faster than Congress tends to legislate.

Industry has long warned about the “risk” or “costs” of a fragmented patchwork of state laws. But those same companies have often been the first to oppose serious federal proposals—particularly comprehensive privacy bills59—that would have unified standards and granted them the very preemption they now claim is necessary. The result is a landscape where the patchwork is not a byproduct of overzealous state action but a direct consequence of industry obstruction at the federal level. In that context, state leadership is not a bug but a feature of the system. The United States has long treated states as laboratories of democracy, giving them the freedom to pilot new solutions.

The result of companies opposing federal AI policymaking is a landscape where the patchwork of state laws is not a byproduct of overzealous state action but a direct consequence of industry obstruction at the federal level.

In practice, real legal conflict across states is often what prompts Congress to act. When courts reached conflicting decisions in the 1990s about liability for online platforms, that tension helped Congress create Section 23060 to resolve the conflicting issues. If state AI laws ever generate similar conflicts that create true uncertainty for national compliance, federal lawmakers will face strong pressure to intervene. That is how the system is designed to function.

Federal AI policy should build on state progress

Congress should not be focused on blocking the limited protections that currently exist at the state level, particularly since few have actually come into effect. Instead, it should focus on establishing foundational federal policies that start with prohibiting the most dangerous abuses of AI and creating guardrails for responsible use for higher-risk applications. As part of that work, Congress should learn from the states. Some of the most urgent safeguards, including prohibitions on abusive surveillance, algorithmic discrimination, and algorithmic pricing, have already begun to take shape at the state level and are likely to continue expanding as more states act. For example, New Hampshire and Oregon have passed laws banning the use of real-time remote biometric identification for surveillance in public spaces by law enforcement without a warrant,61 and five states have introduced bills to curb surveillance pricing.62 Preserving space for state experimentation and leadership is essential to building a governance model that is both protective and adaptive. Lawmakers can start by calling in state officials who have already passed AI laws to testify, offering insights into what is working and where challenges remain, something they never did when passing the reconciliation moratorium. Federal legislation to prohibit specific, high-risk uses of AI may be called for to ensure consistent protections across jurisdictions.

A comprehensive federal privacy law is also a necessary starting point, both because privacy is a fundamental human right that deserves robust protection and because privacy safeguards determine what data can be collected and used in the first place.63 AI systems are only as safe and fair as the inputs they are trained on. Without clear rules for how data are collected, shared, and governed, even the most carefully crafted AI policies will fall short.

Conclusion

The reconciliation AI moratorium proposed in the BBB may have ultimately been scuttled, but the broader effort under the Trump administration to assert federal control over AI policy is just beginning—and House Republican leaders have already confirmed they are actively seeking new avenues to impose a moratorium on state AI laws.64 Congress has an important role to play in setting national rules for AI, but that work should not start by pushing states aside. Strong federal protections are necessary and can be put in place without cutting off efforts from the states that are already underway across the country. States are moving forward with real policies that respond to real problems, and blocking those efforts would not create clarity. It would slow progress, protect industry interests, and silence the only voices trying to keep this technology accountable. Poorly crafted federal preemption and blanket moratoriums on state AI laws in the absence of federal standards are dangerous approaches. Congress should reject any push to centralize control at the expense of state power.",https://www.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/GettyImages-2236950552-CROPPED.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 22:58:31.786694

This uncertainty has made project planning more challenging for professionals in architecture and construction.

Construction cost estimation is a “losing battle” these days, Rachel Smith-Streck, director of strategy and partner at TAP Architecture in Oklahoma City said.

“Just in general, tariffs are affecting everything, so you can’t pinpoint your target,” Smith-Streck said. “Usually, we can do some cost estimation, but now it’s a losing battle. What we think the numbers are going to be when we get to working with the construction team, who has a real job to do, [the cost] is over here,” she said, gesturing up, “and we thought it was right here,” gesturing down.

The impending expiration or reduction of several commercial and residential tax credits for HVAC and renewable energy sources at the end of the year are also raising final construction costs, Smith-Streck said.

Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” Act, which passed in July, cut several tax credits aimed at encouraging long-term investment in energy efficiency and clean energy. These tax credits were implemented as part of former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and were originally set to be phased out in 2032.

On Dec. 31, the full 30% credit offered through the Business Energy Investment Tax Credit expires, leaving only the 6% base credit through 2028, before it is phased out entirely. The ITC applies to the cost of commercial installations of qualifying energy systems, including solar, storage, geothermal, fuel cells and wind.

“I know the expiration is coming up, and that’s going to be a challenge, mainly because [geothermal] is something we always push if our client can do it,” Smith-Streck said. “If you can afford that upfront cost, it’s way better, but obviously, now that you don’t have those credits either, that’s going to be a challenge.”

Smith-Streck said TAP Architecture is working with Mid-America Christian University on a project now, and they’re considering a geothermal energy system.

“When we’re thinking about their project, if they can buy that in the beginning of a new build, it’s going to save them money in the long run, because they’re going to keep that building forever,” Smith-Streck said. “It’ll be easy to maintain, and it’ll be cheaper to run, but if you can’t afford it, the tax credits aren’t [going to be] there that helps some of our clients afford it. That’s a difficult thing.”

Auto supply chain has weak links Last month, Honda Motor was the first automaker to indicate its production was impacted by the chips dispute.
Volkswagen indicated at that time that it only had about a week's supply left of semiconductor chips before its production could be affected.
That's why, while this pause is a small step toward a resolution, it is still welcomed news in the auto industry, said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions.
""With the trade tensions currently disrupting the global supply chain, any easing is a good sign,"" Fiorani told the Detroit Free Press.","Detroit's auto industry is closely watching the latest development in an impending semiconductor chip crisis to see if the issue is resolved and the industry can exhale ― or if it leads to a bigger dearth of semiconductor chips that brings new vehicle production to a halt.

On Nov. 19, the Dutch government said it was suspending its intervention at computer chip maker Nexperia because of 'constructive talks' with China. The Dutch government has been in a dispute with China for several weeks now, which has led to shortages of chips used by carmakers in a variety of car parts.

The dispute stems from the Dutch government taking control at Nexperia on Sept. 30 on the grounds that it had to do so to prevent the company's former chief executive from moving operations to China. In reaction, China stopped all exports of Nexperia's finished products on Oct. 4. China has since relaxed that export halt a bit.

According to Reuters, Dutch Economy Minister Vincent Karremans said suspending the government intervention was a gesture of goodwill as the conversations continue.

""We are positive about the measures already taken by the Chinese authorities to ensure the supply of chips to Europe and the rest of the world,"" he said in a statement in Reuters.

It's good news for Detroit's car companies and the rest of the auto industry as many carmakers are reported to have set up ""war rooms"" to monitor and mitigate the chips shortage to keep it from causing too much disruption to new-car production.

Detroit's history with chips

The last thing the Detroit automakers want is a repeat of the COVID-caused semiconductor chip shortage in 2021, which led to thousands of unfinished vehicles sitting in parking lots across the country awaiting chips to complete production and ship to dealers.

So news of progress in the talks between the Dutch and Chinese governments was a welcome respite to Detroit automakers, though they remain cautious.

General Motors spokesman Kevin Kelly told the Detroit Free Press on Nov. 19: ""We are carefully monitoring the situation on this, but our operations have not been impacted.""

Last month, GM CEO Mary Barra said: ""While this has the potential to impact production, we have teams working around the clock with our supply chain partners to minimize possible disruptions. The situation is very fluid, and we will provide updates throughout the quarter as appropriate.""

Crosstown at Stellantis, spokeswoman Jodi Tinson said of the latest development that Stellantis continues to monitor the situation. When asked whether the automaker had any production disruptions, Tinson said in an email: ""Stellantis continues to develop mitigation strategies to minimize potential disruption.""

But during its third-quarter earnings call with the media, Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa said the automaker had a ""cross-functional ‘war room’ "" where a team manages this situation daily.

Ford Motor Co. did not immediately provide a comment in reaction to the latest news. However, during its third-quarter earnings call with the media, COO Kumar Galhotra said Ford is working with both the U.S. and Chinese administrations for a resolution and that CEO Jim Farley had traveled to Washington, D.C., to push for a resolution.

""The kind of parts Nexperia makes are fairly common parts and we have maximized our buy for these components from other sources as much as we could,"" Galhotra said last month. ""We're tracking how much time we have, how much we've been able to buy, how long it could take to resolve this situation.""

He said it will be very close in terms of keeping supply of the chips until there is a solution.

""We believe a very quick breakthrough is necessary to avoid fourth-quarter production losses,"" Galhotra said. ""Not just for us, but for the entire industry.""

Auto supply chain has weak links

Last month, Honda Motor was the first automaker to indicate its production was impacted by the chips dispute. Honda made production cuts at all of its main North American plants, including large vehicle assembly and supporting facilities across the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Volkswagen indicated at that time that it only had about a week's supply left of semiconductor chips before its production could be affected.

That's why, while this pause is a small step toward a resolution, it is still welcomed news in the auto industry, said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions.

""With the trade tensions currently disrupting the global supply chain, any easing is a good sign,"" Fiorani told the Detroit Free Press.

But he warned that this event should serve as a warning to every player in the automotive industry that they must address any weak link in their supply chain.

""Nexperia is just the latest in a long line of broken links that can quickly bring down on an automaker or even the whole industry,"" Fiorani said. ""Semiconductors have been in the spotlight for five years and the potential hazards are not going away anytime soon, but chips are just the most obvious component that can cause trouble.""

Fiorani said all automakers and suppliers should secure supplies of core materials such as aluminum, steel, cobalt, copper, nickel and lithium as well as chips going forward.

“Some of it just went too far, and so they’re cutting back.” Some Louisiana wetlands will still have protections in place against development.
More at risk are the state’s inland wetlands, which have no added barriers to development without the Clean Water Act.","The Environmental Protection Agency wants to take away federal protections for millions of acres of wetlands in Louisiana and the rest of the country, allowing them to be polluted or developed without the need for permits under a new set of proposed regulations the agency unveiled Monday.

The EPA’s long-awaited proposed rules would change what counts as federally protected waters in the United States. They suggest more rollbacks of regulations that could lead to development in Louisiana and across the country in areas that have long been shielded.

The draft regulations cover what are called the Waters of the United States, or WOTUS. They include new definitions for what counts as a wetland that falls under the protection of the Clean Water Act.

In short, the proposed updates require wetlands to touch permanent bodies of water — such as lakes, rivers or streams — and have visible surface water for at least part of the year in order for federal safeguards to apply.

Most at risk in Louisiana are the non-coastal, inland swamps that make up about 59% of the state’s wetlands area, according to an analysis from the Environmental Law Institute.

Environmental advocates argue the rules would put important ecosystems, flood control measures and pollution management at risk, while legal experts worry the definitions will only add more confusion to an already complex topic.

The public will have 45 days to submit a comment on the proposed WOTUS rules once they are officially published in the Federal Register on Thursday. The EPA will then consider whether any comment warrants revisions in the proposed regulations, which would be incorporated into the final version. The Trump administration has not laid out a timeline for putting the new rules into effect.

“I think it’s a big alarm for pretty much wherever you are, that federal oversight over wetlands is drastically limited, and there is not a backup plan to deal with this,” said Haley Gentry, assistant director of the Tulane Institute on Water Resources Law and Policy.

“It’s going to create a lot of … problems for states and local communities going forward who have relied on federal oversight and the mitigation for wetlands and development,” she added. “There will be confusion.”

The removal of certain federal wetlands protections follows the 2023 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Sackett v. EPA, which pared back federal authority to enforce the Clean Water Act. An Idaho couple successfully challenged the agency when it stopped them from developing their property, with justices interpreting the definition of Waters of the United States to mean “’only those relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing.”

The proposed rule raises questions in Louisiana as to whether future construction could disqualify even more wetlands from Clean Water Act protection, said Matt Rota, senior policy director for Healthy Gulf, a Louisiana-based environmental advocacy group.

Central to whether or not a wetland is protected is whether or not it touches a lake, river or bayou on which a boat can navigate.

“In Louisiana, that can get a little squishy,” Rota said.

The Louisiana Legislature passed a law earlier this year that defines wetlands separated from surface water connections by manmade levees as “fastlands,” excluding them from state protections. With the newly proposed federal WOTUS definitions following the same deregulatory lines as Louisiana, certain wetlands here would no longer have any safeguards against development, advocates say.

Plus, Louisiana now allows future construction of levees and berms to disqualify wetlands from state protection. Even if an area has coverage under the law today, it could lose it if a levee is built around it in the future, Rota said.

State Sen.“Big Mike” Fesi, R-Houma, who authored the legislation, said this is an area in which revisions to the proposed WOTUS rule are necessary.

“In public comment, they can go through all of those and get some good answers for stuff like that,” said Fesi. “I don’t want to go fill up a swamp that’s full of cypress trees.”

Fesi added that he is “excited” about the proposed rules and believes current building codes are adequate to address concerns over building in flood-prone areas.

“I think there’s been a lot of rules put in place that protects against some of the problems” with flooding, he said. “Some of it just went too far, and so they’re cutting back.”

Some Louisiana wetlands will still have protections in place against development. For example, any area that touches the navigable waters of the Gulf of Mexico falls under the Clean Water Act, and the state’s coastal zone construction restrictions protect other areas.

More at risk are the state’s inland wetlands, which have no added barriers to development without the Clean Water Act. These areas would need to meet the federal definition of having surface water at least during the wet season as well as continually touch a waterway like a lake, river, stream or bayou.

“Hopefully this will not have a huge impact on coastal restoration activities and protecting our coastal wetlands,” Rota said. “But our coastal wetlands are only as healthy as our internal wetlands and internal waterways that are feeding them.”

“Whenever you remove some of these more upland wetlands or ephemeral streams that supply either fresh water, nutrients … it could still have an impact,” he added.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_9859-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 18:01:47.113689

Versant's Maine Public District in far northern Aroostook County will see bills go up $16 a month, almost $200 a year.

Every year, the commission undergoes a competitive bidding process to select electricity suppliers that provide Versant and CMP customers power through a regulated rate called the standard offer.

Electricity supply makes up half of Versant customers' bills and 40% of CMP bills. The remainder is transmission and distribution fees and ""public policy"" charges that cover some of Maine's renewable energy initiatives, according to the commission.

""We recognize that rising energy costs create real challenges for Maine households and businesses,” PUC chair Philip Bartlett said in a press release.

""The Standard Offer reflects current market realities and the Commission remains committed to securing the lowest reasonable prices for Maine electric utility customers in a challenging energy environment,"" Bartlett added.

Wholesale natural gas prices across the country are expected to be about 58% higher in 2025 than they were the year before, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Gas prices for electric generation specifically are up 37%, according to the agency.

Andrew Price, president and CEO of Competitive Energy Services, a consulting group in Portland, said several factors are driving demand.

Price said the U.S. is exporting more natural gas than ever before. At the same time gas demand is soaring to fuel generators that power Artificial Intelligence data centers and consumer electrification such as heat pumps and electric vehicles.

Despite years of adding renewable wind and solar generation onto the New England grid, it still relies on gas generators, Price said.

But pipeline supply to New England is constrained, so Price said when demand for residential gas spikes in the winter, there's not enough for power plants and that contributes to high prices.

""The system has to fall back on liquified natural gas that's imported, or oil, and so we do see higher prices here in New England than other places in the U.S. because of that pipeline constraint that really hits in those peak months,"" Price said.

In a statement, Maine Department of Energy Resources acting commissioner Dan Burgess said that a dependence on fuels directly tied to global markets continues to subject Maine families to volatile energy costs.

""Affordability remains a top priority for the Department as we work to advance initiatives to address this urgent challenge by expanding energy efficiency, ensuring ratepayer investments are carefully considered, and expanding responsible clean energy production to help stabilize costs,"" Burgess said.

The contracts approved by the PUC will push electric prices to the highest point since 2022, when Russia's invasion of Ukraine disrupted international gas markets.

In a statement, CMP spokesperson Dustin Wlodkowski said rising supply rates were a direct consequence of state policymakers' decision to deregulate the electricity market 25 years ago which divorced power generation companies from transmission and distribution companies.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9bf461a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5712x2999+0+643/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F13%2Ff4%2F947c89d5492e8642a1a5e2e008dc%2Fimg-3301.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 18:01:40.974472

Hybrids are expected to outpace BEV adoption due to their lack of dependence on charging infrastructure and higher residuals than ICE vehicles.","LAS VEGAS — What a difference a year makes in the automotive space when politics are involved.

A year ago battery electric vehicles (BEVs) were expected to continue to grow in sales and market share, bolstered by federal and state regulations pushing EV adoption and federal incentives encouraging EV purchases.

Since President Donald Trump came into office earlier this year, he has eliminated those incentives and that has caused a recalculating of forecasts for the growth in BEVs and hybrid vehicles in the U.S.

BEV adoption has plateaued in the U.S. over the past two years, according to the new Joint Powertrain Trends and Outlook Forecast, produced by PwC Strategy& for the Auto Care Association (ACA) and MEMA Aftermarket Suppliers.

In a U.S. car parc of 284 million vehicles this year, BEVs account for 3% and hybrids 5%; by 2035, as the car parc grows to 291 million vehicles, EVs are expected to account for 11% and hybrids 15%, the report said.

That is a change from last year's report, where BEVs were expected to account for 20% of total vehicles in 2035 and hybrids about 13%.

As the U.S. short-circuits EVs, China has been charging ahead with electric vehicle adoption, the report said.

About 1.2 million EVs were sold in the U.S. in 2023 and 2024, compared with 6.7 million in China.

Meanwhile, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) have gained some market share in the U.S. while losing share in China.

""One thing that's been interesting is that the hybrid electric vehicles, those continue to gain adoption. So the first half of 2025, it was 12% of the new registrations were hybrid electric, versus 9% in 2024, so a little bit more growth,"" noted Mike Chung, ACA's senior director of market intelligence.

The report stated there are four BEV adoption drivers: vehicle economics, including cost of ownership and regulations, incentives or ICE bans; model availability and choices; consumer behavior, including EV range anxiety and access to charging stations; and charging infrastructure and availability.

New BEV prices in the U.S., averaging $55,400, is 17% higher than the average vehicle transaction price of $47,400. Meanwhile, in China, BEV prices are nearly on par with ICE vehicles, at an average $25,800.

The report also noted the recent regulatory headwinds that will limit BEV adoption in the U.S., including elimination of federal tax credits, which will reduce affordability.

According to surveys, the primary motivations for considering an EV purchase is its lower operating costs, convenience and driving experience. While the main obstacles deterring potential EV buyers include charging duration, battery lifespan, driving range and the initial high cost of purchase.

About 52% of prospective EV buyers would consider a driving range of 185-250 miles acceptable provided they could charge their vehicle in under 30 minutes, the survey said.

The report said that given the favorable economics and lack of reliance on a charging infrastructure, PHEVs are expected to grow in sales in the U.S. until 2035.

By then, hybrids are forecast to account for 37% of new vehicles sales, while BEVs would account for 30%.

This is a more conservative take than last year's report, which predicted BEV sales would account for 59% of new vehicle sales in 2035 and hybrids 22% of sales.

The report said that major OEMs are investing in new hybrid models, with 40 HEV models in 2024 and a predicted 115 models by 2031.

""As a result, we expect to see a major increase in hybrid model availability over the next five to six years that will support higher HEV adoption in the U.S.,"" according to the report.

Hybrids are currently priced about 5% higher than comparable ICE vehicles, but with hybrids' fuel economy, the cost advantage of hybrids is realized after 40,000 miles (or about three to four years).

Despite the higher upfront price, the three-year cost of operation, for standard compact and mid-sized SUVs, is lower for hybrids than ICE vehicles due to the lower fuel costs and high residual values, the report said.

Hybrids are expected to outpace BEV adoption due to their lack of dependence on charging infrastructure and higher residuals than ICE vehicles.

The report expects BEVs to achieve first-cost parity with ICE vehicles by 2028.

Beyond 2030, BEVs are expected to take a share away from ICE vehicles as prices go beyond parity and a charging infrastructure is established, the report said.",https://www.tirebusiness.com/s3/files/styles/1200x630/s3/AdobeStock_573276156%20EV%20electric.jpeg,N,,2025-11-19 22:58:08.802377

The Environmental Protection Agency announced changes to the Clean Water Act that sportsmen’s organizations say could set us back 50 years to a time when rivers lit on fire and fish went belly up.

“This isn’t a little deal, this is a big deal,” says Chris Wood, CEO of Trout Unlimited. “It means that, in a worst-case scenario, the protections of the Clean Water Act, which meant that you couldn’t store chemicals in ephemeral streams, and you couldn’t have manure lagoons in intermittent streams, those protections could be gone.”

The housing, manufacturing, farming, and oil and gas industries, however, heralded the proposed changes as a welcome relief from what they say is over-regulation by the federal government.

“For too long, the regulatory structure under the [Waters of the U.S. Rule], which often has included shifting and unclear definitions, has created legal uncertainty for manufacturers in the U.S., undermining our ability to invest and build across the country,” says the National Association of Manufacturers in a statement.

The changes reflect a 2023 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court in Sackett vs Environmental Protection Agencythat said that the federal government could only police wetlands that have a “continuous surface connection to categorically included waters or have a significant nexus to interstate or traditional navigable waters,” describing “categorically included” waters as those that are “relatively permanent.”

This meant that the federal government could no longer require pollution discharge permits from the Army Corps of Engineers or the Environmental Protection Agency in most ephemeral streams or wetlands. What, exactly, “relatively permanent” meant, however, was up to the EPA itself.

Many sportsmen and conservation nonprofits derided the Supreme Court decision as “bad for the environment and for hunters and anglers.” And under the Biden Administration, more than two-thirds of wetlands and about 5 million miles of streams no longer required oversight of anyone wishing to dump or otherwise destroy and pollute streams and wetlands, says Jim Murphy, the National Wildlife Federation’s senior director of legal advocacy.

The current proposal, however, increases that to 80 percent of wetlands and untold miles of streams and removes federal oversight of streams that cross state lines, says the Izaak Walton League. That means one state’s water quality would depend on a neighboring state’s rules and regulations.

“It makes a bad situation worse,” Murphy says of the newest plan. “We’re really talking about a huge loss of basic pollution and destruction protections for the vast majority of the nation’s wetlands and streams. So there will be fewer places to fish or to hunt and the places that are left to fish and to hunt you will have to worry a little more about what you will be eating.”

The rule change would also threaten drinking water safety for one in three Americans, says the Izaak Walton League. It would also replace “clear and consistent definitions based on science,” with “vague terms like ‘wet season.’”

Wood of TU and others in the sporting and conservation community acknowledge that industries like agriculture require thoughtful and consistent regulations. There should not, however, be a complete overhaul of one of the country’s landmark environmental laws.

Temporary streams and wetlands store water from wet periods into dry ones, and they also provide about 50 percent of the water that ultimately ends up in major rivers, Murphy says.

Those seasonal streams are often headwaters and places where sensitive species like native trout go to spawn, says Wood.

“For close to 60 years, the Clean Water Act applied equally to small streams as it did to big streams and it worked really well,” Wood says. “When my dad was a graduate student at Georgetown, he would never go out to the Potomac River because he’d get sick. Now I take my kids down there and we catch shad hand-over-fist. That story can be told about tens of thousands of waterways across America.”

“Disposing of leftover food products wastes money and pollutes our environment. Estimated methane emissions from Massachusetts landfills have the same climate impacts as 116,000 cars on the road for a year. It doesn’t have to be that way. Food scraps (banana peels, etc) should be composted, and food waste (edible food that’s tossed) should be reduced through rescue, better labeling, and donation.

In 2025, Tech Breakthrough named the company its “Battery Technology Company of the Year.” “I think we’ve really revolutionized RVs with the onset of lithium batteries,” said Phares.
“This award is more than just an investment in Dragonfly Energy; it is an investment in Nevada’s future,” said Phares.","Denis Phares, PhD, was convinced that there had to be a better way. As an associate professor of aerospace and mechanical engineering at the University of Southern California, whose research included aerosol science, nanotechnology, fluid mechanics, and powder processing, he knew there just had to be a better way to manufacture the highly versatile lithium-ion battery cells that were helping to reimagine a variety of the world’s consumer electronics. Not only that, Phares was certain that better solutions were possible at lower production costs while improving the collateral impact on human health, climate, and the environment.

It was 2012, and Phares was ready to make his presence in the industry known beyond the classroom and research papers. So, he packed his bags, enrolled in the MBA program at the University of Nevada, and ventured off to North America’s lithium epicenter to launch his own enterprise.

The road to renewable energy

Today, Phares is president and chief executive officer of Dragonfly Energy Corp., a battery technology company based in Reno, NV. Dragonfly has become renowned for pioneering deep-cycle lithium batteries for its niche markets and is a leader in dry-electrode lithium manufacturing at pilot scale.

“At the time that I left academia, the cost of solar was coming down so fast, but the cost of batteries was still a bottleneck to displacing fossil fuels with renewable energy,” said Phares, who earned his doctorate in environmental engineering science from the California Institute of Technology and bachelor’s in physics from Villanova University. “The mission of the company was to reduce the cost of manufacturing storage so that the combination of storage and renewable energy had a lower levelized cost than burning fossil fuels.”

Dry electrode manufacturing

One who previously had experience in securing Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grants for other types of ventures — including work related to solar cell manufacturing — it became time to advance the now patented aerosol-based dry deposition manufacturing processes for manufacturing electrode material (both anode and cathode) for lithium-ion batteries.

“But there wasn't much interest in the investment community in batteries or manufacturing at all back then,” said Phares. “That story has changed, however.”

Initially going to market with what he branded as “Battle Born Batteries,” a line of lithium iron phosphate (LFP)-powered deep-cycle batteries with a namesake that pays homage to the “Battle Born State” of Nevada, Phares sold his first battery in 2014, and the product caught on as an alternative to lead-acid batteries, the most common type of batteries utilized in recreational vehicles (RVs).

“I was initially just importing commodity cells and designing and assembling the battery packs in Reno,” said Phares. “That business just exploded and became profitable pretty quickly.”

Why RV owners choose lithium over lead-acid batteries

Finding a place within a niche market that was already on the rise prior to the global COVID-19 pandemic, Phares and Dragonfly started to see an exceptional spike in business as the crisis lingered and more people sought the refuge of the outdoors. “RVs grew really big,” Phares explained. “More people began to buy RVs as a way to get out of the cities and to just get away.”

As more people retreated to parks and campsites, those locations became more crowded more frequently, creating difficulty in accessing freestanding pedestals that required plugging into to operate heavy high-power appliances such as air conditioners, coffee makers, and hair dryers. “And as more RVs were put on the road, the number of pedestals stayed the same,” said Phares. “But lithium batteries allowed you to power all those power-consuming appliances without needing a pedestal. And that was really game-changing. We're the market leader now.”

Among the RV industry brands that Dragonfly serves today are Airstream, Leisure Travel Vans, Tiffin, Forest River, REV Group (the first RV company to install Dragonfly batteries at the factory), and its most recently announced collaboration with Awaken RV. To date, the company has sold more than 400,000 LFP batteries, including applications for industrial operations and major heavy-duty trucking fleets. In 2025, Tech Breakthrough named the company its “Battery Technology Company of the Year.”

“I think we’ve really revolutionized RVs with the onset of lithium batteries,” said Phares. “And now we're expanding into heavy-duty trucks, industrial solar, and other adjacent markets where storage really benefits from having a lithium battery solution, while at the same time continuing to scale up the dry electrode process. And we’re continuing to develop new chemistries such as solid-state chemistries in the cell development realm.”

The company has also expanded its reach to various regional locations across northern Nevada, positioning teams strategically within emerging markets, and has an office in Indiana that supports the sales team serving the RV market.

Nevada's strategic position in America's lithium supply chain

As of early October, the company’s relationship with the local region was poised to become strengthened through award funding from the Nevada Tech Hub, a consortium of governmental, industry, educational, and nonprofit organizations designed to improve the state’s lithium battery supply chain by aligning to leverage natural resources and develop a full-spectrum lithium economy within the state. With 31 Tech Hubs nationally, the program invests in regional partnerships to grow critical industries, bolster national security, and create jobs. Focused on building a complete “Lithium Loop,” a closed-loop regional lithium economy that would include extraction, processing, battery manufacturing, and recycling, Dragonfly’s award is expected to total approximately $300,000 to be applied toward high-impact modernization and workforce development initiatives in the state.

“This award is more than just an investment in Dragonfly Energy; it is an investment in Nevada’s future,” said Phares. “By modernizing our operations and expanding our skilled workforce, we believe we can both drive efficiencies that benefit our shareholders, customers, and employees by creating long-term economic growth and high-value jobs across the state. This non-dilutive capital is highly beneficial to our growth strategy.”

Key elements of the project include advancing toward International Organization for Standardization certification, modernizing production systems, and upgrading the company’s battery manufacturing lines. Dragonfly also plans to recruit and upskill production floor personnel, expanding career opportunities in machining, automation, and maintenance. With nearly 400,000 square feet of manufacturing space in South Reno, the company believes it is positioned to scale operations while anchoring high-value clean energy jobs in Nevada. “Nevada is home to one of the largest lithium deposits in the world,” said Phares. “And since lithium is going to be such an important part of our energy future, the state of Nevada is going to be a big part of that. It just makes sense because of the natural resource that we have in the state.”

Patent portfolio: Protecting innovation in battery technology

Working in the fields of energy, nanotechnology, fluid mechanics, and powder processing over the last three decades has provided Phares with a unique perspective as well as an influence on the industry. “As a professor, I was keenly aware that the product of my work was the students themselves,” he said. “I loved teaching, and I loved making an impact by putting out highly skilled members of the economy. But I got the bug for wanting to make a more direct impact on technology. And I think as an entrepreneur, as a company founder, I have found a vehicle to do that. You can more rapidly raise money and more easily direct how that money is spent without being part of a larger institution. I just feel fortunate that I was able to be exposed to both. Not a lot of folks get to do that.”

In the time that he has launched Dragonfly, Phares has achieved nearly 100 patents, the most recent of which came in early September with the company’s Wakespeed Charge Control technology that addresses the transfer of power from a towing vehicle to a trailer for the purpose of charging onboard batteries. With the company’s latest innovation, the Dragonfly IntelLigence battery communication technology, which received a Notice of Allowance from the United States Patent and Trademark Office in mid-October, Dragonfly is poised to expand its growing portfolio. Through this capability, key operating data may be shared by multiple battery systems and related wireless devices over a connected mesh network. Warning codes may also be propagated if certain conditions are detected, even if one of the battery systems is powered down. “We have a vast patent portfolio that the company owns, and that's really important,” said Phares. “The intellectual property portfolio spans everything from fundamental cell chemistries, to cell production, to equipment used to produce cells, to battery packs and battery pack design, to ancillary devices associated with storage systems.”

His future goals include production of the company’s own cells and to be able to produce them domestically. “Ultimately, we want to deploy our technology in onshore production of lithium batteries,” he said. “We want to spread the message that there are better ways to make lithium-ion batteries. And, most importantly, if you want to onshore the production of lithium-ion batteries, because the vast majority are produced in China, you have to innovate with manufacturing processes, or you're never going to be able to compete with the prices you can get out of Chinese-made batteries, even with tariffs. This is on our roadmap, and we're intent on executing it.”",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltb299798942522069/bltd29f86d4bb2427a6/691e2eb1eafe03ab78af786c/Dragonfly_Energy-1.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-11-19 19:59:27.080672

It was knocked out all day; there were power lines and trees down across the roads. The first day of school was scheduled to be the very next day. I was at work. Teachers were getting their classrooms ready to welcome kids.

This was August, the middle of hurricane season. There was a big hurricane passing a couple hundred miles south of Hawaii. There were hurricane-force winds down in town. We had volleyball practice; we had enough daylight to practise in the gym. During practice, at about 3.30pm, I received a call from a parent at the school. She said: “Ryan, there’s a fire in town. We’ve lost our house. We barely got out alive.” Theirs was one of the first houses to go.

Then I received another call from another family. “Ryan, our whole neighbourhood just went up in flames.” Lahaina is small, but those houses are in different parts of Lahaina. In between those homes were several hundred other homes. I just went: “What is going on down in town?”

We sent the kids home. Just after, around 5pm, all our cellphones went out. There’s still no power, no communication, no information. I came home, slightly aware of what was starting. Before the phones went out, a few families had called and asked if they could come to our house. As we went to bed, they showed up. They were like: “We got evacuated. It was just precautionary. We think we’ll be able to go back in the morning, and everything will be there.” So they didn’t have much stuff packed.

We were setting up mattresses, and people were getting ready to sleep on couches. We had candles going everywhere. There was chatter about what was happening in town. We had five different sets of families in our house that night.

I was in bed, and at about 10.30pm, one of our kids came in and said: “Hey, Dad, there’s a police officer at the door and he wants to talk to you.” I went to the door. He said: “Hey, are you Ryan, the principal of Maui prep?” I said yes. He goes: “We got to open your school right now. We have to set it up as an evacuation centre because there’s buses on their way up to the school. You need to open everything up.”

I hopped in the car and drove up to the school, roughly 1km away, out of the fire zone. The police officer had his lights going and I was following. Everything was just black. There’s still no power. But, at one point, you could see this big, orange, arching glow over the whole town. The stark contrast: this bright orange glow with pitch black sky. Feeling the weight of knowing something tragic was going on but not having any idea of the scale of the devastation.

There were several cars and a bus waiting. The police officer and I opened up the gates and as many classrooms as we could. All these city buses started arriving full of people covered in smoke and ash and soot. They were just black head to toe. People were injured. Some were in their clothes. Some were in their pyjamas. Some were soaking wet.

The fire started up in the mountains and was getting to the highway. People were abandoning their cars and the only place they could keep going was the ocean. I remember carrying a little 80-year-old Japanese lady off the bus and she was drenched because she had spent a few hours out there. People were trying to find her some dry clothes or a towel and trying to get her out of the wind.

The buses just kept coming. An influx of people and buses. Maui prep families started showing up to the school to help. Our school is only 300 kids. That night, we had 800 people on our campus.

Everything just felt muted. People were so in shock, just laying on the floors of our classrooms, sleeping on our gym floor. Families huddled up together having quiet conversations. Our only sources of light that night were emergency gas-powered floodlights on our outdoor basketball court.

The only time anything was loud was if someone was injured. We had a little triage centre set up in one of our classrooms. I don’t recall any major injuries but people had bumps and scrapes, some of them were burns, sprained ankles. People were crying or expressing a great deal of pain. In the night, someone would be moaning.

I remember the sun coming up the next morning. A mother drove up to the school, saw me standing out in the driveway and said: “Ryan, have you seen my girls? We don’t know if they got out of the fires or not.” I coached her girls in club volleyball. I said: “Sorry, I haven’t seen them. They aren’t up here.” I think she was hoping they had somehow made their way up to the school in the night.

I remember we couldn’t cook anything. There’s no power. We had a little concession area. We started handing out all of our bags of Cheetos or ice-cream. We had some bottled water. Tourists, visitors and residents started dropping off food, water and clothes. These weren’t county officials. These weren’t government officials. These were families from other parts of Maui that had gone to Walmart or Target in central Maui, bought as much stuff as they could with their own money, drove it out to us and unloaded truckloads of supplies at the school.

We gave as many as we could to the evacuees and we still had all these supplies. We said: “We’ll serve as a food, water, clothing distribution site.” We let four cars in at a time. A volunteer would come and say: “Hey, what are your needs?” “Oh, man, it would be great if we could just get some water.” Here’s a whole crate of water. Next car comes in. A line of several hundred cars parked down the hill, out to the highway.

I remember this one gentleman who had everything he had in his car. I asked him how he was doing and what he needed. He just said: “I lost everything. I lost my son in the fire. Do you have any water for me?” He was in a state of shock, non-emotive, factual. His son was one of the only kids who died in the fire. I remember my heart breaking for him and feeling helpless. There’s nothing you can do.

It was in the lineup where I saw that mother and her two girls. They drove up to the school and the two of them piled out of the back of their minivan. Their mom was beaming ear to ear. That was such a massive sense of relief and joy. We gave each other big hugs. I knew those girls were OK.

Because the power was out, we had restaurants bringing up food. One family took it upon themselves to feed all 200 of the volunteers. They brought propane grills, cooking breakfast burritos or sausages and bacon and eggs. They cooked up some expensive steaks. I remember those smells and going: “Boy, this is the best-tasting and smelling piece of bacon I’ve had in my life.”

Four or five days after the fire, power miraculously came back on. We thought it was going to be out for a month. There are five other schools on West Maui: two burned down, three were shut down. Five of the schools on West Maui had burned down or shut down so we were like: “Let’s figure out a way to start school.” We met as an administrative team and said: “How can we serve these kids? How can we get as many kids in as possible?” Our teachers said: “Ryan, we don’t care how many kids. You fit as many kids to our school as you can.” We had over 1,000 applications in four days. We brought in 150 students in that admission period. Unfortunately, we couldn’t bring all those kids just because we didn’t have enough space.

We had first day of school on 21 August. Normally, it’s a fun, celebratory time, our mascots out there waving signs and taking pictures with kids. But it wasn’t like that. It wasn’t sad. It wasn’t celebratory. It was trying to create a warm, welcoming environment for kids.

I remember telling teachers: “If you’re assigning chapter 1, page 13, questions 10 through 30 in the math textbook on day one, you’ve missed the mark.” We’re not here to add to their stress. We are here to give them some anchor in the storm. We’re here to support them emotionally. Some of these kids were living in hotel rooms. Some were living with three other families at a friend’s house. I remember “normalcy” being used quite a bit then, and I remember feeling sick of using this word.

Six months after the fire, we were sitting in school and the power goes out. Immediately, the question was: “Are we going to be safe? Is there going to be another fire?” It was so fresh among a lot of our younger students. That trauma is still present for a lot of people. A year and a half out, homes are now being built in Lahaina. The fire continues to be the foundation on which our daily lives are built.

There is a general sense of frustration that the federal government only provided $700 for people who lost their homes. It would’ve been great for there to be a higher level of support. Having more, better evacuation routes is part of the conversations Lahaina residents are having as they rebuild.

What we learned after is that initial wave of response is not some relief organization or government. It’s people helping. This seems to be typical of disasters. The devastation to the community is well documented. On one side of the coin, we saw devastation. On the flip of it, we saw the positive nature of humanity shining through in how people supported other people.

It’s a little bit funny, but for the next six months or so, we’d be walking around town and we’d see a little elderly lady walking around in a Maui prep uniform. We knew that there was a good chance she was up at the school that night and that was someone who we were able to help and support.

We got to bear witness to this side of humanity that was so giving and so supportive. Seeing the generosity of others willing to support our community in such a time of drastic need. Seeing the resilience of everyone who lived through that experience, however big or small. I think that instills a lot of hope for me and our community.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/621d9558d4d76f4e0ebb64e9233f671076d9bb9c/0_3062_5504_4403/master/5504.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e48ca4c7b2fe62644ecfa291af49e871",N,,2025-11-19 17:01:51.786007

EPA appears poised to provide relief from many of the reporting requirements included in the current (2023 edition) of the TSCA reporting rule.
This eliminates the massive challenge consumer product makers would face in tracing minimal PFAS content within complex finished consumer products imported between 2011 and 2022.
The proposed amendments will align the PFAS rule more closely with other standard TSCA reporting requirements to which consumer product manufacturers generally are not subject, such as the Chemical Data Reporting rule.
Next Steps for Manufacturers Regardless of these new exemptions from EPA, consumer product manufacturers should continue to focus on preparing for meeting PFAS-in-products reporting obligations in various states (and in some states, complete product prohibitions).","On November 13, 2025, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed significant amendments to the October 2023 final rule for PFAS reporting under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) Section 8(a)(7). If codified, these modifications would substantially reduce the regulatory burden for covered entities, particularly for manufacturers and importers of consumer products, small entities, and companies that manufacture or import products and formulations that might contain only trace levels of PFAS.

The proposed changes will considerably ease the reporting burden for consumer product manufacturers, for whom the feasibility of comprehensive reporting on imported articles presents a significant challenge. Consumer product makers are already facing a host of other evolving state-based bans and restrictions on intentionally-added PFAS when present in expansive categories of covered products. EPA appears poised to provide relief from many of the reporting requirements included in the current (2023 edition) of the TSCA reporting rule. Notable proposed exemptions that will benefit consumer product manufacturers, but were absent in the original rule, include:

Exemption for Imported Articles: Crucially, EPA is proposing to completely exempt reporting on PFAS that is imported as part of an article. This eliminates the massive challenge consumer product makers would face in tracing minimal PFAS content within complex finished consumer products imported between 2011 and 2022.

De Minimis Concentration Exemption: A concentration threshold of 0.1% or lower for PFAS in mixtures or products also would be exempt from reporting.

Other Exemptions: The proposal also includes exemptions for PFAS that are impurities, certain byproducts, R&D chemicals manufactured in small quantities, and non-isolated intermediates.

The proposed amendments will align the PFAS rule more closely with other standard TSCA reporting requirements to which consumer product manufacturers generally are not subject, such as the Chemical Data Reporting rule.

In addition, the original reporting window, which had already been delayed, is now proposed to be shifted again. The new submission period will open 60 days after the effective date of the final rule, for a period of three months.

Read our November 2025 Advisory for a broader analysis of the proposed rule.

What Remains Unchanged?

The fundamental aspects of the original rule, besides the newly proposed exemptions, largely remain intact. The requirement to report on PFAS manufactured or imported at any time between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2022, remains in place. In addition, covered companies must continue to exercise due diligence to locate and report existing test data and studies concerning PFAS that is known or reasonably ascertainable within their organization and through reasonable inquiry to suppliers or customers.

Next Steps for Manufacturers

Regardless of these new exemptions from EPA, consumer product manufacturers should continue to focus on preparing for meeting PFAS-in-products reporting obligations in various states (and in some states, complete product prohibitions).

Products that may already be covered by state PFAS-in-product laws, despite these proposed federal revisions, can include:

Non-Stick Cookware Cleaning Products Water-Resistant Textiles and Outdoor Apparel After-Market Sprays and Treatments for Water or Stain Resistance

Grease-Resistant Food Contact Materials

Specialized Industrial or Commercial Products

Paints, Varnishes, and Surface Sealants Personal Care Products and Cosmetics

The proposed changes that EPA may make to its PFAS reporting rule are not yet finalized and are subject to a public comment period that remains open until December 29, 2025. This comment period presents an opportunity for advocacy with EPA and for states to further harmonize their PFAS-related obligations. Consumer product manufacturers should review their potential reporting obligations based on these proposed exemptions and consider submitting comments to EPA, with the support and guidance of counsel, through the official rulemaking docket at Regulations.gov (Docket ID: EPA-HQ-OPPT-2020-0549).

AEP also owns AEP Energy, which provides innovative competitive energy solutions nationwide.","FORT WAYNE, Ind., Nov. 19, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Indiana Michigan Power (I&M), an American Electric Power company, is taking another step to deliver reliable and affordable energy to meet the needs of its customers today and in the future. The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) approved the agreement between I&M, Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor (OUCC), and consumer groups to acquire the Oregon Clean Energy Center, an existing 870 megawatt (MW) natural gas plant located in Oregon, Ohio.

The acquisition of the Oregon Clean Energy Center and its 870 MW of natural gas-fueled electric generation is one component of I&M's Future Ready plan, which outlines a comprehensive strategy to serve customers in a cost-effective, reliable manner as the demand for energy increases.

With today's IURC order, and the approval received by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in October, I&M now has secured the necessary regulatory approvals to complete the acquisition of the Oregon facility. Over the next few months, I&M will work with the current owners of the Oregon facility to transfer ownership and operations of the facility in a safe and efficient manner. I&M expects to take ownership of the Oregon facility in March 2026.

""The Oregon Clean Energy Center is an important opportunity to further diversify I&M's current generation portfolio, acquire dependable generation, and position us for future growth to the benefit of all our customers,"" said Steve Baker, I&M president and chief operating officer.

I&M is currently navigating an unprecedented time in its history. As the company looks ahead, power demand is expected to more than double the Indiana peak from approximately 2,800 MW in 2024 to more than 7,000 MW in the 2030 timeframe. The rapid growth in energy demand provides an opportunity for I&M to reshape the way it serves current customers and those the company will serve decades into the future.

“Funded by the Energy Dominance Financing Program, this interest-bearing loan will lower Constellation's cost of financing and leverage private investment to restore reliable nuclear energy to the grid and help America win the AI race,” said Constellation Energy, the biggest owner of U.S. nuclear power plants.

Last year, Constellation signed its largest-ever power purchase agreement with Microsoft, which paved the way for the restart of the Three Mile Island Unit 1 nuclear plant.

The 20-year agreement paves the way for the launch of the Crane Clean Energy Center (CCEC) with the restart of Three Mile Island Unit 1, Constellation said in September 2024.

Three Mile Island Unit 1 operated for decades before being shut down for economic reasons six years ago.

Under the deal, Microsoft will purchase energy from the restarted unit as part of its goal to help match the power its data centers in PJM use with carbon-free energy. The clean energy center is expected to be online in 2028.

In today’s statement on the DOE loan for the Crane Clean Energy Center, Constellation president and CEO Joe Dominguez said that “It's a great example of how America first energy policies create jobs, growth and opportunities and make the grid more reliable.”

“Utilities and grid operators are moving too slowly and need to make regulatory changes that will allow our nation to unlock its abundant energy potential. Constellation and nuclear energy are helping to lead the way and we are thankful to President Trump and Secretary Wright for putting the 'energy' back into DOE,” Dominguez added.

Nuclear energy will be one of the winners of the AI and data center boom, as Microsoft and other hyperscalers have been looking to purchase zero-carbon electricity to power up their data centers, which are consuming growing amounts of electricity.

The proposed rule will be open for public comment for 45 days.
The revised WOTUS rule ensures that only large bodies of water and their main tributaries fall under federal jurisdiction.
In addition to congressional advocacy and technical comments to the EPA, NCBA also stood up for cattle producers’ rights in court.","On Nov. 17, 2025, the US Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of the Army announced the signing of a proposed rule to revise the definition of ""waters of the United States"" (WOTUS) under the Clean Water Act. WOTUS defines whether or not a waterbody or wetland is under Federal jurisdiction and protected under the Clean Water Act.

This proposal implements the Supreme Court's decision in Sackett v. EPA.

In developing the proposed rule, EPA and the Army reviewed and considered the extensive feedback and recommendations the agencies received from states, tribes, local governments and stakeholders throughout consultations and the pre-proposal recommendations docket and listening sessions.

The agencies are proposing revisions to the amended 2023 definition of WOTUS to fully implement the Supreme Court’s decision in Sackett v. EPA.

Specifically, the agencies are proposing to revise the definition of “waters of the United States” under paragraph (a) by:

Deleting the interstate waters category

Deleting “intrastate” from the paragraph (a)(5) category for lakes and ponds.

In addition, the agencies are proposing to revise or add the following exclusions:

Revise the (b)(1) waste treatment system exclusion,

Revise the (b)(2) prior converted cropland exclusion,

Revise the (b)(3) ditch exclusion; and

Add the (b)(9) groundwater exclusion.

The agencies are also proposing to add definitions in paragraph (c) of their regulations for:

“continuous surface connection,”

“ditch,”

“prior converted cropland,”

“relatively permanent,”

“tributary,”

and “waste treatment system.”

These proposed revisions would limit those waters found to be jurisdictional compared to the Amended 2023 Rule, respecting state and tribal authority over their own land and water resources.

The agencies are not proposing to change the definition of “wetlands.” They are, however, proposing to add a definition of “continuous surface connection” which is used to identify which wetlands are “adjacent” and therefore jurisdictional under the Clean Water Act.

The proposed rule will be open for public comment for 45 days.

The National Cattlemen’s Beef Association is announcing its support for the new proposed WOTUS rule, which comes after decades of advocacy by NCBA and its state affiliate partners to remove confusing and burdensome regulations on cattle farmers and ranchers.

""Waters of the US has been a longstanding and frustrating issue for family farmers and ranchers. Every few years, the definition of a ‘water of the US’ has changed. Often, this meant that small water features like prairie potholes or dry ditches suddenly fell under federal regulation,” said NCBA President and Nebraska cattleman Buck Wehrbein. “NCBA has spent years fighting to protect cattle producers from excessive red tape.

""We went to the EPA, advocated on Capitol Hill, and even took this issue all the way up to the Supreme Court to protect our members from federal overreach. We appreciate the EPA finally fixing previous WOTUS rules and supporting America’s family farmers and ranchers.""

The revised WOTUS rule ensures that only large bodies of water and their main tributaries fall under federal jurisdiction. Past WOTUS rules issued under the Obama and Biden administrations placed small, isolated water features under federal regulation. Prairie potholes, playa lakes, and even ditches that only carried water after large storms became regulated as if they were a large lake, river or ocean.

In addition to congressional advocacy and technical comments to the EPA, NCBA also stood up for cattle producers’ rights in court. The association filed an amicus brief in the US Supreme Court case Sackett v. EPA and received a major victory in 2023 that rolled back previous overreaching WOTUS rules.

NCBA also initiated numerous lawsuits under the Obama and Biden administrations to prevent what it finds to be harmful rules from impacting cattle producers.

The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) approved the agreement between I&M, Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor (OUCC), and consumer groups to acquire the Oregon Clean Energy Center, an existing 870 megawatt (MW) natural gas plant located in Oregon, Ohio.

The acquisition of the Oregon Clean Energy Center and its 870 MW of natural gas-fueled electric generation is one component of I&M's Future Ready plan, which outlines a comprehensive strategy to serve customers in a cost-effective, reliable manner as the demand for energy increases.

With today's IURC order, and the approval received by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in October, I&M now has secured the necessary regulatory approvals to complete the acquisition of the Oregon facility. Over the next few months, I&M will work with the current owners of the Oregon facility to transfer ownership and operations of the facility in a safe and efficient manner. I&M expects to take ownership of the Oregon facility in March 2026.

""The Oregon Clean Energy Center is an important opportunity to further diversify I&M's current generation portfolio, acquire dependable generation, and position us for future growth to the benefit of all our customers,"" said Steve Baker, I&M president and chief operating officer.

I&M is currently navigating an unprecedented time in its history. As the company looks ahead, power demand is expected to more than double the Indiana peak from approximately 2,800 MW in 2024 to more than 7,000 MW in the 2030 timeframe. The rapid growth in energy demand provides an opportunity for I&M to reshape the way it serves current customers and those the company will serve decades into the future.

The Oregon facility will provide a stable source of power to meet the continuous operational requirements of our existing customers and new customers coming on to the I&M system. I&M's current generation portfolio incorporates a diverse mix of resources, including solar, wind, nuclear, coal and hydroelectric units. The company's vision for the future is to implement a comprehensive approach to providing a reliable, resilient, and stable electric power system that customers can access affordably.

""Demand is growing and we're planning for it, not waiting for it,"" Baker said. ""We're forecasting this growth and investing now in the generation and infrastructure needed to meet it. Our long-term planning strategy means we stay ahead of demand rather than reacting to it. This approach leads to more price stability and reliability for all of I&M's customers.""

Indiana Michigan Power (I&M) is headquartered in Fort Wayne, and its approximately 2,000 employees serve more than 600,000 customers. More than 85% of its energy delivered in 2024 was emission-free. I&M has at its availability various sources of generation including 2,278 MW of nuclear generation in Michigan, 450 MW of purchased wind generation from Indiana, more than 22 MW of hydro generation in both states and approximately 35 MW of large-scale solar generation in both states.

What do you think about Trump’s characterization of the loan interest deduction as helping middle-income buyers?","President Donald Trump highlighted a vehicle loan interest tax deduction during a November 19, 2025 speech, specifically mentioning Tesla and claiming the policy helps “middle income people” afford cars—four months after the same legislation eliminated the $7,500 EV tax credit that made electric vehicles genuinely affordable for average buyers.

“Middle income people, they don’t know about it. They don’t really have deductions. We’re giving them a deduction on the interest, if they buy one of a nice Tesla car, they borrow the money, you’re so lucky, I’m with you, Elon,” Trump said during remarks, according to a transcript. “I’ll tell you, you are… Has he ever thanked me properly?”

The president clarified the benefit isn’t exclusive to Tesla or electric vehicles. “Although I do let him buy other than electric cars, but these are minor details,” Trump continued. “We’ll let it be for everybody.”

The Policy Behind Trump’s Remarks

Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” signed into law on July 4, 2025, allows taxpayers to deduct up to $10,000 annually in interest paid on vehicle loans for American-assembled cars, trucks, SUVs, vans, and motorcycles purchased between 2025 and 2028, according to Kiplinger.

The deduction applies regardless of powertrain—gasoline, hybrid, or electric—as long as the vehicle’s final assembly occurred in the United States. Unlike most tax deductions, it’s available even to taxpayers who take the standard deduction rather than itemizing, making it an “above-the-line” benefit.

However, the $10,000 maximum comes with significant income restrictions. For single filers earning more than $100,000 or joint filers above $200,000, the deduction decreases by $200 for every $1,000 over those thresholds, CBS News reports. The benefit phases out completely at $150,000 for singles and $250,000 for couples.

What the Deduction Actually Saves Middle-Income Buyers

Despite Trump’s characterization of the policy as helping “middle income people,” automotive analysts say most buyers won’t come close to the $10,000 maximum deduction.

Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive, told CNBC that only exotic luxury vehicles generate $10,000 in annual interest charges. It would require financing approximately $112,000 to reach the full deduction in year one—the price range of vehicles like a Porsche Panamera or Cadillac Escalade, with monthly payments exceeding $2,000.

For the average American car buyer financing $44,000 over six years, the first-year interest deduction totals roughly $3,000, declining in subsequent years as principal payments increase, according to the American Financial Services Association.

Because deductions reduce taxable income rather than providing direct savings, a buyer in the 22% tax bracket claiming a $3,000 deduction saves approximately $660 on their actual tax bill. Smoke calculated the real-world benefit as “$500 or less in year one,” with declining value afterward.

By contrast, the eliminated EV tax credit provided up to $7,500 as an immediate discount at purchase, either applied directly to the vehicle price or claimed as a refundable credit on tax returns.

The September 30 EV Credit Expiration

The same Big Beautiful Bill that created the loan interest deduction terminated the $7,500 federal tax credit for new EVs and $4,000 credit for used EVs on September 30, 2025—accelerating an end date that had originally been set for 2032 under the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act.

Bloomberg reported that the $3.4 trillion legislation primarily benefits the wealthiest Americans while eliminating clean energy subsidies and slashing Medicaid. The vehicle loan interest provision was presented as aid to the $1.6 trillion U.S. auto industry.

EV sales surged in the months leading up to the September 30 deadline as consumers rushed to claim the expiring credit. CNBC reported that July 2025 saw nearly 130,100 new EV sales, the second-highest monthly total on record, with dealers offering approximately $9,800 in additional incentives—worth about 17.5% of average transaction prices.

Post-Subsidy Market Collapse

The elimination of EV subsidies triggered exactly the market collapse that industry analysts had predicted. October 2025 EV sales dropped 24% compared to September, with unadjusted sales falling from 98,289 units to just 74,897 units in a single month, according to market analysis firm Omdia.

Cox Automotive senior analyst Stephanie Valdez Streaty warned that EV sales were likely to “collapse” in the fourth quarter once the tax credit expired and the market adjusted to the new financial reality.

General Motors announced in late October it would lay off more than 3,400 workers across battery plants and EV facilities, with CFO Paul Jacobson stating the company expects “EV demand growth to slow pretty significantly.” Ford halted F-150 Lightning production indefinitely, while the company’s Model E electric vehicle division lost $3.6 billion through the first nine months of 2025.

Trump’s Complicated Tesla History

Trump’s November 19 comments praising Tesla mark a striking shift from the bitter public feud between the president and Tesla CEO Elon Musk that erupted in summer 2025 over the Big Beautiful Bill itself.

In July 2025, Trump threatened to terminate federal subsidies and contracts for Musk’s companies, posting on Truth Social:

“Elon may get more subsidy than any human being in history, by far, and without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa.”

Musk fired back, declaring “I am literally saying CUT IT ALL. Now,” and calling the Big Beautiful Bill a “disgusting abomination.” The clash sent Tesla shares down more than 6% in premarket trading.

By June 2025, Trump had sold his own red Tesla Model S after purchasing it in March for $80,000 and showcasing it during a White House demonstration. The Daily Beast reported Trump’s decision to part with the vehicle followed the escalating tensions with Musk.

Trump’s November remarks also included a reference to eliminating EV mandates, stating: “We had a mandate. Which even Elon thought was ridiculous, that everybody has to have an electric car by 2030. And once, fortunately, he said, That’s a ridiculous thing.”

No federal law has ever mandated that Americans purchase electric vehicles, though the Biden administration did implement EPA emissions standards that Republicans argued effectively served as EV mandates by making it costly for automakers not to produce more electric models.

EVXL’s Take

This announcement feels like a victory lap for a policy that’s been law since July 4, delivered four months after it helped crater the EV market Trump claims to support. Let’s be clear about what actually happened here: Trump eliminated a $7,500 point-of-sale credit that made EVs accessible to middle-class families, replaced it with a tax deduction worth maybe $660 in actual first-year savings for average buyers, and is now calling that replacement a gift to “middle income people” while specifically name-checking the company whose CEO spent $250 million getting him elected.

We warned this would happen. Back in July when the Big Beautiful Bill passed, EVXL explained that industry analysts predicted a 72% drop in planned EV sales over the next decade. By November, those predictions were reality—October EV sales collapsed 24% as the post-subsidy chickens came home to roost. General Motors laid off 3,400 workers, Ford stopped making the F-150 Lightning, and America’s $28 billion Battery Belt devolved into ghost towns of idled plants and mass layoffs.

Meanwhile, Toyota just announced a $912 million investment in U.S. hybrid production while Detroit’s Big Three hemorrhage money on subsidy-dependent EV strategies that evaporated on September 30. That’s the real story—the automaker that never went all-in on EVs is expanding capacity for vehicles people actually buy without needing taxpayer subsidies, while competitors who bet everything on government incentives are now in strategic retreat.

The loan interest deduction isn’t worthless, but let’s not pretend it’s comparable to what it replaced. A middle-class family financing a $44,000 vehicle saves about $660 on next year’s taxes versus the $7,500 they could have knocked off the purchase price before September 30. The only people getting anywhere near that $10,000 maximum are wealthy buyers financing six-figure luxury vehicles—exactly the demographic that least needs tax relief for car purchases.

And then there’s the Tesla angle. Four months ago, Trump and Musk were in a public brawl over this exact legislation, with Trump threatening to cancel Tesla’s federal contracts and Musk calling the bill a “disgusting abomination.” Trump literally sold his Tesla Model S in June after their feud escalated. Now he’s back to praising the company, asking if Elon has thanked him properly, and positioning the loan deduction as some kind of favor to Tesla—even while clarifying it applies to all automakers, not just EVs.

The timing matters. Why tout this policy in November when it’s been law since July and took effect January 1? Because the post-subsidy EV market collapse is now undeniable, layoffs are mounting, and someone needs to pretend there’s still government support for American EV manufacturing. The loan deduction provides that political cover while delivering a fraction of the actual financial support the eliminated tax credit provided.

The average EV transaction price grew to $65,021 in October, up over $3,000 from January and almost $5,000 from September, according to a report from Edmunds.
This is the highest average EV price that Edmunds has recorded for a single month this year.
The tax credit was often criticized for being a subsidy for affluent consumers: the U.S. taxpayer effectively paid for wealthy buyers who could take advantage of the credit to buy fairly expensive EVs.
If there are fewer new EVs for sale long-term, that could push prices higher – or cause prices to stabilize at an elevated level.","Affordability isn't exactly a defining feature of the current U.S. car market. The average transaction price for all new vehicles is hovering around $50,000, but if you're looking for an EV, brace for even more serious sticker shock, in the post-government-incentive era.

Here's Automotive News:

October gave the auto retail industry its first look at what the electric vehicle market looks like without the federal tax credits. One of the biggest trends: EVs were more expensive. The average EV transaction price grew to $65,021 in October, up over $3,000 from January and almost $5,000 from September, according to a report from Edmunds.

This is the highest average EV price that Edmunds has recorded for a single month this year. The cheapest was $57,690 in July – and that's not really what anyone would call ""cheap,"" properly speaking, for a new car. At these price levels, it has been hard to buy an EV, and with the disappearance of federal tax credits, it has officially gotten quite a bit harder.

The tax credit was often criticized for being a subsidy for affluent consumers: the U.S. taxpayer effectively paid for wealthy buyers who could take advantage of the credit to buy fairly expensive EVs. The counterargument was that those rich early adopters would help establish an EV market in the U.S., generate revenue for manufacturers, and ultimately enable cheaper EVs to enter the picture as we transitioned away from the combustion engine.

However, the incentive also functioned as just that: an encouragement to consider an EV in the first place, especially in the leasing market, where the savings could be passed on to customers whose tax profile wasn't going to allow them to claim the credit. With rapid advancement in technology, leasing was also appealing to people who didn't want to be stuck owning an outdated EV. But as Automotive News reported, leasing penetration was also down big time in October. So we're kind of back to beginning now with EVs: the spike in prices means that affluent buyers could once again determine what the market looks like.

From the July low, prices have jumped about as much as the maximum $7,500 credit. So you might wonder if this is a top, or if they could climb even higher. It will be interesting to see what happens over the next six months. Automakers have been backing off from their EV plans and have been scrambling to revive combustion and hybrid programs. If there are fewer new EVs for sale long-term, that could push prices higher – or cause prices to stabilize at an elevated level. On the other hand, overall demand for EVs could decline, both a result of high prices and buyers deciding they aren't interested anymore. That could drive prices down. In a very basic sense, incentives distorted the market, and we'll now find out what it truly looks like when available products have to be matched up with customers motivated by factors other than their tax liabilities. If I were going to make a prediction, I'd say that by this time next year, that $65,000 average EV price is going to be closer to the norm, and that buyers hunting for affordable transportation in the U.S. will be shopping mainly for gas-powered vehicles.

On Nov. 17, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced a proposed rule that would establish what the agencies call “a clear, durable, common-sense definition of ‘waters of the United States’ (WOTUS) under the Clean Water Act.”

The proposal, unveiled at EPA headquarters in Washington, D.C., follows the 2023 Supreme Court decision in Sackett v. EPA.

According to the EPA, the agencies developed this proposed rule using input from multiple sources, including a pre-proposal recommendations docket, information from nine public listening sessions, and consultation comments from states, tribes and local governments.

Key proposed revisions include:

• Defining key terms like “relatively permanent,” “continuous surface connection,” and “tributary” to appropriately delineate the scope of WOTUS consistent with the Clean Water Act and Supreme Court precedent;

• Establishing that jurisdictional tributaries must connect to traditional navigable waters either directly or through other features that provide predictable and consistent flow;

• Reaffirming that wetlands must be indistinguishable from jurisdictional waters through a continuous surface connection, which means that they must touch a jurisdictional water and hold surface water for a requisite duration year after year;

• Strengthening state and tribal decision-making authority by providing clear regulatory guidelines while recognizing their expertise in local land and water resources;

• Preserving and clarifying exclusions for certain ditches, prior converted cropland and waste treatment systems; Adding a new exclusion for groundwater; and

• Incorporating locally familiar terminology, such as ""wet season,"" to help determine whether a water body qualifies as WOTUS.

In addition, the limitation to wetlands that have surface water at least during the wet season and abut a jurisdictional water will further limit the scope of permafrost wetlands that are considered to have a continuous surface connection under the proposed rule. These proposed changes are intended to provide clarity and consistency to the continuous surface connection definition.

“When it comes to the definition of ‘waters of the United States,’ EPA has an important responsibility to protect water resources while setting clear and practical rules of the road that accelerate economic growth and opportunity,” said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin. “We heard from Americans across the country who want clean water and a clear rule. No longer should America’s landowners be forced to spend precious money hiring an attorney or consultant just to tell them whether a Water of the United States is on their property.”

“We are pleased that the new rule protects critical water sources while respecting the efforts of farmers to protect the natural resources they’ve been entrusted with,” said American Farm Bureau Federation President Zippy Duvall. “The Supreme Court clearly ruled several years ago that the government overreached in its interpretation of what fell under federal guidelines. We are still reviewing the entire rule, but we are pleased that it finally addresses those concerns and takes steps to provide much-needed clarity.”

The definition of WOTUS influences Clean Water Act implementation, including whether farmers, landowners and American businesses must secure permits before they can pursue projects that might impact surface water quality. Having a durable, consistent, and clear definition of WOTUS is essential to lowering costs for Americans and accelerating economic growth while protecting human health and the environment.

The proposed rule is scheduled to be published in the Federal Register on Nov. 20 and open for public comment for 45 days. The unpublished version can be viewed here.

California CCAs Achieve Procurement Milestone – Secure 21+ Gigawatts of New-Build Clean Energy Resources

Community choice energy providers are accelerating the state’s clean energy buildout, supporting California’s reliability goals and driving billions in long-term customer savings.

Sacramento, Calif.— The California Community Choice Association (CalCCA) announced today that California’s Community Choice Aggregators (CCAs) have surpassed a major clean energy milestone, securing more than 21,000 megawatts (MW) of new-build clean energy capacity through long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs).

“Exceeding 21 gigawatts marks a pivotal moment not just for CCAs, but for California’s clean energy future,” said CalCCA Chief Executive Officer Beth Vaughan. “We are building a more reliable, affordable grid by prioritizing diverse clean energy resources and cutting-edge storage that strengthens local resilience for millions of Californians.”

CCA PPAs equate to:

21,380 MW of new solar, wind, geothermal, energy storage, and demand response resources

138 operational clean energy projects totaling more than 9,700 MW serving CCA customers (1,800+ MW became operational in the last year)

More than $48.4 billion in investments by CCAs to build and operate clean energy resources

Support for more than 48,000 construction jobs

Each November, CalCCA reports on CCA contracting progress, demonstrating how these community-driven providers are leading California’s clean energy buildout. CCAs now serve more than 15 million customers—more than one-third of the state’s population—across 200+ cities and counties.

Community choice energy providers have now secured 389 long-term PPAs, totaling 21,380 MW of new-build clean energy, including over 11,500 MW of renewable energy and more than 9,600 MW of energy storage. CCAs added over 3,000 MW of new contracts in just the last year.

This year, energy storage was the fastest-growing category in the CCA PPA portfolio, increasing by more than 20% since last year to support system reliability during peak demand and advancing California’s transition toward a resilient, 24/7 carbon-free grid.

CCA PPAs reflect a range of energy storage technologies including lithium-ion, vanadium redox flow batteries, and compressed air. Almost half of the new CCA-contracted clean energy projects that became operational in the past year were “hybridized,” meaning the clean energy is co-located with storage.

Notably, the suite of CCA PPAs includes CleanPowerSF’s first-of-its-kind contract with the Gonzaga Ridge Wind Farm in Merced County, which pairs 147.5 MW of in-state wind power with 50 MW of battery energy storage. Gonzaga Ridge is the first wind-storage hybrid PPA in the portfolio of CCA long-term new-build contracts.

CCAs’ long-term PPAs range from 10 to 27 years in length and average 16 years across all agreements. Long-term PPAs can reduce power purchasing costs by protecting customers from exposure to market price fluctuations.

CCAs are also continuing to leverage innovative green bond prepayment financing through the California Community Choice Financing Authority (CCCFA) to reduce costs. To date, CCCFA has issued $23 billion in prepayment bonds, equating to approximately $150 million per year in savings for community choice customers—nearly $4.6 billion over the lifetime of the contracts. More on CCA green bonds here.

Ambitious procurement strategies not only expand clean energy capacity for CCAs but also help meet and, in many cases, exceed state goals (mid-term reliability, renewables portfolio standard/SB 350) and local mandates set by CCA boards for renewable energy and reliability. The graphic below shows the capacity and types of energy resources procured by CCAs and their online years.

Community choice energy providers “now play a dominant role in renewable procurement, and their portfolios already exceed the 2030 RPS targets,” notes energy consulting firm Energy + Environmental Economics (E3). CCAs also account for the majority of procurement activity in California, according to E3.

CCA-contracted power projects are located across 28 California counties—from Humboldt to San Diego—and in Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, and Utah.

The federal Department of Energy closed a $1 billion loan to finance the restart of a nuclear reactor at the former Three Mile Island plant, where energy will be produced to power Microsoft data centers in PJM’s transmission region.
Mark Rodgers, a spokesperson for Constellation, told the Capital-Star that the federal loan is welcome, and will help reduce overall borrowing costs for the project.
While long-term impacts on the health of people living nearby were minimal, the accident became a symbol for the risks of nuclear energy production in the U.S.
“Constellation’s restart of a nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania will provide affordable, reliable, and secure energy to Americans across the Mid-Atlantic region,” U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a press release.","This story was updated on Nov. 19, 2025 at 3:53 p.m. to clarify a description of the 1979 accident at Three Mile Island.

The federal Department of Energy closed a $1 billion loan to finance the restart of a nuclear reactor at the former Three Mile Island plant, where energy will be produced to power Microsoft data centers in PJM’s transmission region.

Mark Rodgers, a spokesperson for Constellation, told the Capital-Star that the federal loan is welcome, and will help reduce overall borrowing costs for the project. He added that the reactor will be a strong source of clean energy, which will offset the added demand on the power grid created by data centers.

“We’re appreciative of [the loan],” Rodgers said. “It’ll be helpful to Constellation. And for the government, we’re going to pay it back in full with interest, so ultimately the taxpayer will get a return.”

Three Mile Island was the site of the worst nuclear power disaster in U.S. history, when one of its two reactors partially melted down in 1979, releasing some radioactive material into the surrounding environment. While long-term impacts on the health of people living nearby were minimal, the accident became a symbol for the risks of nuclear energy production in the U.S.

The other on-site reactor, which shuttered in 2019, is what will be brought back online by Constellation Energy. It’s being renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center.

“Constellation’s restart of a nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania will provide affordable, reliable, and secure energy to Americans across the Mid-Atlantic region,” U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a press release. “It will also help ensure America has the energy it needs to grow its domestic manufacturing base and win the AI race.”

The taxpayer-backed loan is financed through the Trump administration’s Energy Dominance Financing Program, which will back projects aimed at boosting energy infrastructure capacity for the U.S. Artificial Intelligence industry.

The project, however, has faced some pushback from community members who live near the reactor, some of whom lived through the 1979 incident.

At a public hearing on the reopening in July, a number of people voiced concerns about the risks of another meltdown being shouldered by Middletown and the surrounding communities in Dauphin County, while virtually all of the energy created will go towards powering data centers.

Others spoke in support of the project, with many welcoming the construction jobs it will bring and the potential positive impacts on the local economy.

The reactor is expected to be operational in 2027.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-96/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/img_4445-1024x7681763585650.jpg?h=ddb1ad0c&itok=DsSlh7pI,N,,2025-11-19 21:00:48.067301

The announcements, made during the Saudi-US Investment Forum, come as US President Donald Trump and Prince Mohammed spoke of deepening ties related to investment, security and technology.

“The partnership between our two nations is among the most consequential in the entire world, and together, the Crown Prince and I are making an alliance stronger and more powerful than it's ever been before,” Mr Trump said in remarks at the Kennedy Centre.

The business forum was attended by crowds of business executives including the heads of Aramco, Nvidia, Qualcomm, General Dynamics and Pfizer. Mr Trump said $270 billion in deals between dozens of companies would be signed at the forum.

Prince Mohammed announced on Tuesday that the kingdom would invest $1 trillion in the US, up from its previous $600 billion commitment. He did not provide details or a timeline. He also said he expects Saudi Arabia to spend $50 billion on chips in the “near term”.

The US and Saudi Arabia also signed a strategic AI partnership that will include the supply of advanced semiconductors. US companies need government approval to export chips to Saudi Arabia.

Regional experts have questioned how Saudi Arabia will be able to afford the $1 trillion commitment as it focuses on domestic investments. The kingdom is also running a current account and fiscal deficit, and is also facing softening oil prices amid the unwinding of production cuts by Opec+.

Humain deals

Among the announcements made on Wednesday was the formation of a joint venture involving the Public Investment Fund-backed Humain, which is expected to play a critical role in the kingdom's efforts to become an AI exporter.

Saudi Arabia has been investing heavily in AI as part of its broader diversification efforts under its Vision 2030 project.

Humain, AMD and Cisco said the joint venture, which has yet to be named, would deliver up to 1 gigawatt of AI infrastructure by 2030.

The companies said it will combine Humain's data centres with technology from AMD and Cisco, which will be exclusive technology partners. AMD and Humain announced plans in May to invest up to $10 billion for 500MW of AI computing capacity over the next five years.

Adobe and Qualcomm also said they are linking up with the Saudi AI company to create content in Arabic using Humain's large language model Allam, Reuters reported.

Humain announced a strategic partnership with the New York-based Global AI to build a large-scale AI data centre in the US. It said the data centre will be designed for high-density compute and include Nvidia AI infrastructure.

“I believe Saudi Arabia is firmly on track to become the third pillar of global AI infrastructure,” Humain chief executive Tareq Amin said in a statement.

Humain has also led a $900 million financing round for video generation start-up Luma AI. The financing also includes participation from AMD's venture arm, as well as existing investors Andreessen Horowitz, Amplify Partners and Matrix Partners.

Luma is also linking up with Humain to build a 2GW computer supercluster known as “Project Halo”, which the companies said will begin operations in the first quarter of next year.

AWS and Humain also announced the installation of up to 150,000 AI accelerators to develop an ""AI Zone"" in Riyadh that will support training and access to Nvidia infrastructure.

Musk's xAI in Saudi Arabia

Tesla chief executive Elon Musk said his AI start-up xAI, which features the Grok chatbot, also plans to develop a 500MW data centre in Saudi Arabia with Humain, which will rely on chips from Nvidia.

Mr Musk made the announcement alongside Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang during a panel session earlier on Wednesday.

The project represents xAI's first large-scale computing centre outside the US.

“This collaboration represents the first of its kind partnership to deploy xAI’s Grok across an entire country,” Mr Musk said in a statement.

Aramco signs series of deals

Saudi energy giant Aramco also announced 17 agreements with a potential value of more than $30 billion with US companies. Aramco said the agreements build on the previous 34 announced in May, bringing the total value to about $120 billion.

The preliminary deals range from liquefied natural gas to advanced materials manufacturing and financial services.

Among the LNG deals is a possible investment with MidOcean Energy in the Lake Charles LNG project in Louisiana, near the Gulf Coast. It also announced an agreement with Commonwealth LNG on a separate Louisiana-based LNG project relating to Aramco Trading's potential purchase of LNG and gas.

The preliminary agreements come as Aramco aims for 20 million tonnes a year of LNG capacity.

Aramco signed a deal this year with NextDecade on a final agreement to buy 1.2 million tonnes a year of LNG from the Rio Grande LNG Facility's Train 4.

“For more than 90 years, we built a lot of strategic and historic relations with US partners. And it is continuing to grow in the US today,” Aramco chief executive Amin Nasser said during a panel discussion.

The companies said the milestones advance their long-term partnership to develop solar projects that will expand and diversify Colombia’s renewable energy capacity with support from the European Union.

Petalo del Norte I, located between Cesar and Norte de Santander, is CFM’s first project to reach commercial operation in Latin America, the companies said.

The 26.4MWdc (19.9MWac) fixed-tilt solar plant generates more than 45GWh of electricity a year and avoids around 13,276 tonnes of CO₂ annually while serving approximately 32,600 people, they added.

According to the partners, the project was developed with Erco Energia, implemented by Andina Solar, and interconnected through a 1.2km aerial line at 34.5kV.

The companies said the project created 270 jobs, 64% of which were filled locally, with women representing 30% of the workforce.

CFM said it invested close to USD20m in development and construction funding through Climate Investor One, which is supported by the European Union, and that the project benefits from a 15-year power purchase agreement.

The companies said the USD125,000 Community Development Programme for Petalo del Norte I supports four neighbouring communities through initiatives in education, water access, women’s empowerment and rural enterprise development.

CFM said it has invested USD1.5m from Climate Investor One to develop Pradera, which will be Colombia’s largest solar-plus-storage plant.

The company added that Pradera will provide 40MWac of solar capacity and 18MWh of storage, generating more than 95.8GWh of power annually, avoiding about 129,000 tonnes of CO₂ and supplying around 71,000 people.

According to CFM, Pradera will create around 380 construction jobs and 29 permanent roles and will include a dedicated Community Development Programme.

The partners said the battery system will help smooth short-term fluctuations, manage grid imbalances and limit exposure to high-cost spot prices during dry periods such as El Nino events.

They added that both projects were enabled by CFM’s blended finance model, which combines public and private capital to balance risk and accelerate delivery.

Juan Paez, Head of Latin America at Climate Fund Managers, said: “Access to capital for climate infrastructure remains one of the main barriers to achieving Colombia’s 2050 net zero ambition¹.”

He said: “Our partnership with Erco Energía, supported by the European Union, shows how blended finance can help bridge that gap - unlocking investment for projects that strengthen energy security and accelerate the clean energy transition.”

Alberto Menghini, Head of Cooperation at the European Union Delegation in Colombia, said: “The European Union is Colombia´s main energy transition partner, not only through Foreign Direct Investments, but also through financial mechanisms such as CFM’s Climate Investor One Fund.”

He said: “This approach enables transformative initiatives such as Pétalo del Norte I and Pradera, which strengthen and diversify Colombia´s energy mix while creating local jobs and opportunities.”

Juan Camilo Lopez, Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of Erco Energia, said: “Expanding solar generation is essential to strengthen Colombia’s energy security and resilience.”

He said: “Together with CFM, we are demonstrating how partnerships that combine local expertise with international investment and experience can accelerate that shift.”

The partners said Colombia’s dependence on hydropower leaves the grid exposed to drought, while non-conventional renewables supply less than 2% of electricity but are expanding rapidly.

They added that projects such as Pradera will improve grid reliability and reduce the need for fossil fuel back-up during dry seasons.",https://renews.biz/media/35552/petalo-solar-pv-plant-2-cfm.jpg?width=640,N,,2025-11-19 21:59:10.958949

The federal Department of Energy closed a $1 billion loan to finance the restart of a nuclear reactor at the former Three Mile Island plant, where energy will be produced to power Microsoft data centers in PJM’s transmission region.

Mark Rodgers, a spokesperson for Constellation, told the Capital-Star that the federal loan is welcome, and will help reduce overall borrowing costs for the project. He added that the reactor will be a strong source of clean energy, which will offset the added demand on the power grid created by data centers.

“We’re appreciative of [the loan],” Rodgers said. “It’ll be helpful to Constellation. And for the government, we’re going to pay it back in full with interest, so ultimately the taxpayer will get a return.”

Three Mile Island was the site of the worst nuclear power disaster in U.S. history, when one of its two reactors partially melted down in 1979, releasing some radioactive material into the surrounding environment. While long-term impacts on the health of people living nearby were minimal, the accident became a symbol for the risks of nuclear energy production in the U.S.

The other on-site reactor, which shuttered in 2019, is what will be brought back online by Constellation Energy. It’s being renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center.

“Constellation’s restart of a nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania will provide affordable, reliable, and secure energy to Americans across the Mid-Atlantic region,” U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a press release. “It will also help ensure America has the energy it needs to grow its domestic manufacturing base and win the AI race.”

The taxpayer-backed loan is financed through the Trump administration’s Energy Dominance Financing Program, which will back projects aimed at boosting energy infrastructure capacity for the U.S. Artificial Intelligence industry.

The project, however, has faced some pushback from community members who live near the reactor, some of whom lived through the 1979 incident.

At a public hearing on the reopening in July, a number of people voiced concerns about the risks of another meltdown being shouldered by Middletown and the surrounding communities in Dauphin County, while virtually all of the energy created will go towards powering data centers.

Others spoke in support of the project, with many welcoming the construction jobs it will bring and the potential positive impacts on the local economy.

c: 202.913.0126

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Representatives Yvette D. Clarke (NY-09), Diana DeGette (CO-01), Jared Huffman (CA-02), Kathy Castor (FL-14), and Jan Schakowsky (IL-09) reintroduced the Frack Pack, a set of five bills aimed at closing loopholes that allow the oil and gas industry to skirt key environmental and public health protections. The legislative package would hold the industry accountable for pollution that threatens clean air, safe drinking water, and the health of communities across the country.

The Frack Pack includes the FRAC Act, the CLEANER Act, the FRESHER Act, the SHARED Act, and the CLOSE Act.

“When a regulatory loophole within the Clean Air Act enables fracking and other environmentally harmful practices to bring dangerous toxins and climate-changing emissions into our communities unimpeded, it’s clear legislative action is necessary to correct the shortcomings and protect public health. The ‘aggregation exemption’ has, for too long, allowed for an unacceptable status quo in climate policy in America, and it is past time for that to change,” said Rep. Yvette D. Clarke. “I am proud to introduce my legislation, the CLOSE ACT, to address this destructive exemption, just as I am proud to support the Frack Pack as a comprehensive solution towards amending the loopholes that put polluters first and leave the American people last.”

“For too long, oil and gas companies have enjoyed special exemptions from our nation’s bedrock environmental laws that no other industry gets,” said Dianne DeGette. “The Frack Pack would finally put an end to that double standard. These commonsense reforms will protect our air, water, and communities while ensuring greater transparency and accountability in the fracking process. I’m proud to work with leaders like Reps. Huffman, Castor, Schakowsky, and Clarke on these important bills.”

‘”The fossil fuel industry gets to dump their runoff into stormwater thanks to special exemptions for no good reason – polluting our water supply and putting communities at risk,” said Rep. Jared Huffman. “Why should Big Oil billionaires get to skirt the rules? They shouldn’t. The FRESHER Act closes this loophole to even the playing field and stop them from destroying communities so we can get this public health and environmental crisis under control.”

“Families deserve clean air to breathe and clean water to drink, and the CLEANER Act is a practical step to make that a reality,” said Rep. Kathy Castor. “By holding polluters accountable and closing loopholes that let dangerous toxins seep into our waterways and neighborhoods, we can make communities healthier. Encourage Congress to move this bill and build a healthier, safer future for every community.”

“Hydraulic fracking is a serious risk to our water, no matter how much Big Oil and Gas insist it is safe. The truth is, these companies are not even required to report when their fracking activity contaminates the local water supply,” said Rep. Jan Schakowsky. “The SHARED Act is commonsense legislation that would require oil and gas companies to test nearby water sources and disclose the results regularly. Families deserve to know that the water coming out of their tap is safe to drink and use. I am committed to holding the fossil fuel industry accountable. Protecting our clean water is not optional; it is essential.”

The CLOSE Act would decrease toxic air pollution that comes from oil and gas exploration and production activities and add hydrogen sulfide to the list of hazardous air pollutants regulated under the Clean Air Act. Hydrogen sulfide is an air toxic released during oil and gas exploration and production. Additionally, it would reverse the exemption of oil and gas companies from the Clean Air Act’s aggregation requirement, which allows multiple activities or facilities to be collectively permitted as one single source.

The FRAC Act would eliminate the “Halliburton Loophole,” established under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, under which fracking fluids are exempted from regulation under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). The FRAC Act would require fracking companies to publicly disclose the chemicals they are pumping into the ground and give the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) the authority to regulate the process under its Underground Injection Control program. The oil and gas industry remains the only economic sector exempt from this important program.

The CLEANER Act would make oil and gas companies responsible for cleaning up and disposing of hazardous waste that comes from their operations under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), Subtitle C, the country’s hazardous waste management law.

The FRESHER Act closes the loophole for oil and gas companies in the Clean Water Act and creates a study to better understand the effect of stormwater runoff from oil and gas companies.

The SHARED Act would require testing for water contamination near fracking sites.

“The members of our respective caucuses hold diverse views of how Congress should improve the energy infrastructure permitting process; however, as leaders of these caucuses, we are unified in our belief that the current actions of the Trump Administration and Congressional Republicans are blocking us from engaging in good faith, bipartisan permitting reform negotiations.

“Any serious permitting reform package must address – as a threshold matter – the Trump Administration’s active undermining of America’s clean energy industry by using every tool it can find to slow or block projects. The Administration regularly does not follow existing law, including revoking duly issued permits, rescinding previously-awarded grants, and issuing stop work orders on projects well under construction. Over the past 10 months, we have heard outcries over the Administration’s actions from state governments, businesses, and workers responsible for building critical clean energy projects to address growing electricity demand while improving the reliability and affordability of our energy system, but our Republican colleagues in Congress have remained largely silent in the face of the Trump Administration’s abuses.

“Ensuring that clean energy projects are treated fairly and can move forward where appropriate is the prerequisite for serious, practical negotiations on a reform package capable of meeting the nation’s energy needs. Additionally, to be comfortable with any sort of agreement, we need to be able to trust that this Administration is going to follow the law that we write.

Washington, D.C. – Today, Ranking Member Huffman released a statement on the Trump administration’s announcement to push back the compliance deadline for the Methane Waste Rule, clearing the way for polluters to ignore regulations and avoid paying royalties to public and Indian mineral owners.

“Their first week back after the longest shutdown in American history, Republicans haven’t done a single thing to lower costs or improve the lives of hardworking people. Instead, they’ve prioritized rolling out the red carpet for their billionaire donors,” said Ranking Member Huffman. “Trump is shirking the law and robbing taxpayers blind so Big Oil can keep pumping out emissions without having to pay a cent for polluting our air.

“It has been proven time and again that this pollution gives our kids asthma, spikes cancer rates, and causes miscarriages. Health care prices are about to skyrocket, but instead of solving this Republican-caused crisis, they are clearing the way for corporations to keep poisoning our communities just to pad their pockets.

“Meanwhile, the rest of the world is meeting at COP to work together on curbing this exact kind of pollution to address climate change – but Trump couldn’t be bothered to show up for America. He’s surrendering to China and driving our allies straight into Xi Jinping’s arms to partner with him instead on clean, cheap energy that addresses the climate crisis. Rolling back these safeguards is a complete abdication of our responsibilities and climate leadership on the global stage. This has got to stop. Americans want clean air and clean water––not handouts to polluters.”

Background

The Bureau of Land Management announced it is pushing back deadlines for oil and gas companies to comply with the Methane Waste Rule, which tightened rules on the venting and flaring of methane from oil and gas production on federal lands.

The rule would have charged oil companies royalties for the methane their operations produce but don’t deliver to market as natural gas to compensate public and Indian mineral owners.

BLM will delay enforcement by one year for two of the rule's provisions that were scheduled to take effect on Dec. 10.

This decision is the latest in a string of attacks on the environment and public health by Republicans. On Monday, Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Army Corps of Engineers announced their proposed revision of the Waters of the United States, which would further restrict which water bodies are protected from pollution and destruction under the Clean Water Act. This will let polluters dump in and destroy more waters all across the country.

On Tuesday, House Republicans voted to overturn a series of federal land protections to lock the American people into higher energy costs by sabotaging clean, renewable energy to prop up polluters. The three Congressional Review Acts will handcuff the Department of the Interior, making it illegal for the agency to stop prioritizing fossil fuels -- even to protect communities from climate-induced wildfires, save collapsing habitats, or combat prolonged drought.

Combined with the rapid growth of AI-fueled data center construction, the costs are becoming harder to accurately predict.
This increased capacity comes at a cost, which is spread among all consumers, not just data centers.
Data centers also use enormous amounts of water to keep themselves cool, with some consuming as much water as a small town.
With more data centers built each year, water sources will be further strained, decreasing water quality and availability for local residents.","Big things are happening in North Louisiana. What was once acres of quiet farmland in Richland Parish, located amid sparsely populated rural towns, has been turned into a hotbed of construction. When Meta broke ground on its new $10 billion data center project, “Hyperion,” changes were immediate. In a parish (Louisiana’s version of a county) of just over 20,000 people, 5,000 out-of-state construction workers are projected to be working here at the project’s peak. The allure of jobs and economic development may be enticing, but states need to approach data centers with caution.

As flattering as it would be, Meta did not choose my home state of Louisiana as the location of its new mega-project for our great food or Southern charm. Rather, Louisiana gave Meta what it wanted in tax breaks.

Over the span of a few weeks, state legislators rewrote a bill originally for rural broadband sales tax rebates to instead subsidize data center construction. No one knows how much this will cost the state, as Louisiana enacted these data center subsidies in 2024 without producing an official cost estimate. Neither officials nor the public will know the amount of lost revenue until Meta applies for its sales tax rebates in the following years.

What’s happening in Louisiana isn’t unique. With companies like Meta, Google, and OpenAI spending record-breaking amounts on data center construction, state governments are rushing to offer billions of dollars in subsidies, apparently without understanding their full costs.

According to a report by Good Jobs First, at least 10 states are already losing more than $100 million each in revenue a year from these tax breaks—money that could instead be going to early childhood and K-12 education, infrastructure, or other services. Combined with the rapid growth of AI-fueled data center construction, the costs are becoming harder to accurately predict. Texas saw its annual cost estimates grow from $130 million to over $1 billion in the span of 23 months.

Despite these heavy public investments, data centers are creating few permanent jobs. While Meta’s new data center in Louisiana is bringing in thousands of construction jobs, most of those workers will go away once the project is finished. Meta, instead, is only required to create 500 full-time jobs by 2035 to receive the maximum amount of tax breaks. Although this will be one of the largest data centers in the world, the modest target of 500 jobs is not that surprising. Data centers may take up a lot of space, but they are mostly filled with computers and electronic equipment and do not need lots of employees. One analysis finds that even large data centers generally employ less than 150 people. When all is said and done, this leaves states with an extraordinarily high cost per job created.

The costs to residents are not just fiscal. Data centers require immense amounts of electricity to keep themselves running, but states don’t have the existing infrastructure to meet these needs. In Louisiana, Entergy is building three new gas-fired power plants just for Meta’s data center, which is projected to use more than three times the electricity of New Orleans on any given day. This increased capacity comes at a cost, which is spread among all consumers, not just data centers. Some residents in other states have seen their electricity bills double and even triple over the last five years in areas with high data center activity. In places like Richland Parish, where 25 percent of people live below the poverty line, such increases would further impoverish those already struggling to make ends meet.

Data centers threaten the environment as well. Over 50 percent of energy used to power data centers comes from fossil fuels. These centers are already releasing over 100 million tons of carbon and other pollutants into the atmosphere each year. As in Louisiana, these numbers will increase as more fossil fuel power plants are built to meet data centers’ energy demands. Data centers also use enormous amounts of water to keep themselves cool, with some consuming as much water as a small town. With more data centers built each year, water sources will be further strained, decreasing water quality and availability for local residents.

With out-of-control tax breaks, growing consumer costs, and environmental concerns, states need to call a timeout on their data center subsidies. State and local governments should reevaluate if these subsidies are necessary, given that Meta, OpenAI, Amazon, and Google are already some of the richest companies on the planet. States need to put their own residents first to ensure that they’re protected from negative externalities of the data center industry. Otherwise, a race to the bottom, draining revenues and pocketbooks, is inevitable.","https://media.itep.org/cdn-cgi/image/format=webp,onerror=redirect/https://media.itep.org/stock-data-center-construction-corporate-tech-subsidy-state-768x432.jpg",N,,2025-11-19 15:02:29.191995

To turn the signals from the Climate Action Agenda into accelerated action across every sector.","Below are remarks from UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell, delivered at the Global Climate Action high-level closing event at COP30 in Belém, Brazil, on Wednesday 19 November 2025.

Excellencies,

Colleagues, dear Friends,

We have said throughout this COP that the world is watching and willing climate cooperation to stand firm in a fractured world.

The Climate Action Agenda is showing this cooperation at work:

COP30 has racked up an impressive scorecard of real-world climate actions that will also mean stronger economies, more jobs and better lives for many millions.

A trillion-dollar charge into the clean energy and grids.

A global plan to quadruple sustainable fuel.

Moves to unlock new waves of green industry.

The pipeline for new adaptation investment, among many others.

Meanwhile in national climate plans, we are seeing whole-of-economy, and whole-of-society approaches coming to the fore.

This is transformational – unthinkable only a few years ago.

But this is no moment for self-congratulations – this is the moment to step up.

To strive for measurable, real-world results for people, for economies, and for the planet.

This is the Climate Action Agenda.

I want to acknowledge the COP30 Presidency for its clarity of purpose as we work to ensure the Action Agenda works hand-in-hand with the formal negotiations process.

This alignment matters deeply.

It is helping ministers and ministries design climate plans rooted in practical solutions that cut emissions and strengthen resilience; helping governments unlock jobs, investment, cleaner air, and more secure, affordable energy for your citizens, businesses and vital services like hospitals and schools.

The Climate Action Agenda is not a nice-to-have on the side. It is mission critical, and a key part of the Paris Agreement.

I have said many times that, in this new era, we must strive to bring the formal COP process closer to the real economy, for faster implementation, and to spread the vast benefits to billions more people.

The Climate Action Agenda enables and harnesses the momentum we are seeing in the real economy.

And it shows that the work of negotiators and the work of the real economy can and must work together to deliver the Paris Agreement.

This is no accident. For [a decade], the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action has been essential for a global ecosystem of non-Party stakeholders, and it can – it will – do much more.

It has brought together businesses, cities, regions, investors, civil society, including Indigenous Peoples – helping sustain momentum, share innovation, and keep ambition rising even in the toughest of geopolitical conditions.

That collaborative architecture has never been more essential.

It is the bridge that connects national ambition to local action, global goals to community realities.

It has been strengthened immeasurably by the leadership of our Climate High-Level Champions, Nigar and Dan.

Your work with the 5-year vision provides the continuity and inclusivity required for the future of this agenda.

You have been indispensable partners – to the process, to the Presidency, and to the UNFCCC secretariat. Count on me and my team to accompany you and future Champions in this journey to make this vision a reality. Thank you.

Colleagues, this Climate Action Agenda is a central catalyst for implementation: where multilevel governance and cooperation between governments and non-Party actors accelerates us towards our goals.

The responsibility now lies with all of us – Parties and non-Parties, public and private sectors, national and subnational implementers – to deliver results fast, fairly, and at scale.

Because people everywhere deserve to have the benefits of climate action: better health, more resilient communities, greater security and prosperity.

And because every moment of delay is far too costly.

So let us close the gap between commitments and delivery that protects and improves people’s lives.

To turn the signals from the Climate Action Agenda into accelerated action across every sector.

And to show the world that climate cooperation stands firm, serving the interests of every nation, every economy and every person.

I thank you.",https://unfccc.int/themes/custom/unfccc/favicons/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-11-19 16:01:02.199003

Pennsylvania’s Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) issued an air quality permit to Homer City Generation yesterday, clearing the way for construction of what could become one of the nation’s largest gas-fired power plants.

The department originally projected a decision on the permit by August 2026, 285 days from the application date, and made it in just 157 days. As the commonwealth prioritizes fast-tracked permits, the accelerated process is a win for developers — but environmental groups opposed to the plan say that carbon and toxic air pollution from the site could harm nearby residents.

“This was not an unexpected [decision],” Alex Bomstein, executive director of the Clean Air Council, told Technical.ly soon after the decision was released. “However, the speed with which DEP rushed this permit through, especially given the magnitude of the pollution and the number of people who are going to die because of it, is troubling.”

The proposed $10 billion project for the Homer City Energy Campus would redevelop a former coal-burning power plant site in Indiana County to deliver up to 4.4 gigawatts for the on-site data centers and local homes, according to the Homer City Redevelopment group.

Despite project leads touting economic wins, environmental groups argue that air pollution from the power plant will exacerbate the climate crisis, and the data centers will drive up the cost of electricity.

Homer City Redevelopment did not respond to multiple requests to comment on the project or the recently issued permit.

Communities speak up about the project

Over 500 responses were submitted during the public comment period for the permit. Residents, especially in rural areas, have spoken out about data centers because of pollution, stress on the groundwater and high energy usage.

When asked about the decision, DEP pointed to its public comment responses. By issuing the permit, the agency is confirming the proposed project adheres to air quality requirements and will use the best available technology to mitigate environmental concerns.

Homer City Redevelopment has said the project’s gas turbines will cut emissions by up to 65% compared to the former coal plant and that the campus will be a major economic opportunity for Indiana County. The company projects over 10,000 temporary construction jobs and roughly 1,000 permanent positions in energy and tech once the campus is operational.

Despite possible gains, the Clean Air Council said the pollution, potential noise, odor and compromised drinking water from the data center campus would mean minimal return benefits for the surrounding community.

“This illegal permit is a death sentence for many of those who will breathe its toxic fumes in Indiana County and across the nation,” Bomstein said. “Rushed-through, riddled with errors and for what? It’s not to keep our lights on. It’s for New York hedge fund investors and for tech billionaires to get rich off of technology designed to lay people off.”",https://technical.ly/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Homer-city-energy-campus.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 16:02:36.785791

The US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) reported on October 9 that EcoFlow Technology has received six reports of the recalled Power Stations catching fire, with property damage totaling over $850,000.

The recall involves EcoFlow Delta Max 2000 Model EFD310 Power Stations. These power stations are black and silver, with a rectangular LCD display screen on the front and six electrical outlets on the back. “ECOFLOW MAX” is printed on the right side. “EFD310” and “EcoFlow DELTA Max (2000)” are printed on the nameplate on the underside of the product. They were sold at Costco.com, Amazon.com and Ecoflow.com from July 2022 through May 2025 for about $1,600.

In its October announcement, CPSC said that consumers should immediately stop using the recalled power stations and contact EcoFlow Technology for instructions on installing a free repair in the form of a firmware update. It also noted that the affected power stations may overheat and ignite, posing a risk of serious burn injury and fire hazard.

On Wednesday, the company’s spokesperson told ESS News: “The recall notice applies to DELTA Max 2000 units sold in the US, however, we have made the firmware update available globally. Compensation is handled and determined by the third-party insurance provider. We will fully assist our customers throughout the claims process to ensure their rights and interests are protected.”

Asked to explain what went wrong with the affacted devices, the spokesperson said that it was found that “in rare cases, operating the device in high-temperature, humid conditions and poorly ventilated environments increased the risk of overheating”.

“While the number of units affected is extremely limited, we are issuing this safety notice out of an abundance of caution to protect all of our customers. The situation is not caused by a hardware defect, but rather by logic triggers under certain conditions. The firmware update optimizes the control logic allowing the device to better handle extreme conditions,” the spokesperson explained.

The firmware update has been approved by the CPSC and there is no physical recall of the product. In the meantime, EcoFlow has also implemented proactive quality control measures.

“Through the EcoFlow App and firmware, we now monitor cell status in real time. If abnormal temperatures are detected, the system will display a warning icon and we will proactively contact the user to arrange a replacement. We take this matter very seriously and are committed to the safety and reliability of our products,” the spokesperson said.",https://www.ess-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ecoflow-1.png,N,,2025-11-19 17:01:06.333177

As the world accelerates toward net-zero, the global energy transition is triggering an unprecedented surge in demand for critical minerals — from copper and cobalt to manganese, platinum-group metals, graphite, and rare earth elements. These minerals are essential building blocks for solar panels, wind turbines, electric vehicles, transmission grids, hydrogen technologies, and battery storage.

With some of the world’s richest reserves, Africa is emerging as a pivotal supplier of these transition – critical materials. The 2026 Africa Energy Indaba will place this issue as a key discussion as part of its strategic agenda, highlighting Africa’s dual role as both a growing energy market and a global minerals powerhouse.

A Global Race for Critical Minerals

According to the IEA, demand for many critical minerals will double or even triple by 2030 due to the rapid expansion of clean-energy technologies.

The Guardian reports that global copper demand is rising sharply, with the IEA warning of “structural supply risks” unless mining and processing capacity expands significantly.

The shift toward electric mobility and renewables is expected to increase demand for cobalt by up to six-fold, lithium by seven-fold, and nickel by three-fold by 2040 under the IEA’s sustainable development scenario.

Africa Holds Extraordinary Mineral Wealth

Africa’s resource endowment positions the continent at the centre of the global clean-tech supply chain:

The Democratic Republic of Congo produces over 70% of the world’s cobalt.

South Africa holds about 80% of global platinum-group metal reserves, crucial for hydrogen electrolysers and fuel cells.

Zambia and the DRC collectively account for roughly 10% of global copper reserves.

Mozambique, Tanzania, Madagascar, and Namibia have rapidly growing graphite and rare – earth deposits.

Southern Africa controls more than a third of the world’s high-grade manganese.

These resources give Africa enormous leverage in shaping the trajectory of global decarbonisation —

but they also highlight the need for smart policy, ethical extraction, and stronger local beneficiation.

Turning Mineral Wealth into Industrialisation

While Africa is rich in resources, most minerals are exported as raw materials, with minimal in-country value addition. The 2026 Africa Energy Indaba will spotlight the need for a new, strategic approach:

Local processing and refining to retain value, create jobs, and promote industrial diversification.

Regional value-chain development to support battery manufacturing, green hydrogen systems, and component production for renewable energy technologies.

Sustainable and responsible mining frameworks to ensure environmental protection, community benefits, and improved governance.

Cross-border infrastructure investment, including energy, logistics, and transportation systems, to unlock mining corridors and mineral-processing hubs.

A Central Discussion Topic at the 2026 Africa Energy Indaba

At the 2026 Indaba, Critical Minerals & the Green Transition will be a key focus topic, convening key voices from:

African governments & policymakers

Mining and energy companies

Global clean-tech manufacturers & investors

DFIs, ESG standards bodies, and supply-chain auditors

Researchers and local industrialisation experts

The Session will explore:

How Africa can secure a fair share of value in global clean-energy supply chains

Strategies to attract sustainable capital for mineral extraction and processing

Building battery, hydrogen, and renewable-energy manufacturing ecosystems

Policies that ensure a just, inclusive, and environmentally responsible mining sector

Partnerships to strengthen African-led value chains from mine to market

A Defining Opportunity for Africa

Africa is not just a destination for clean-energy investment — it is a critical engine of the global energy transition. As demand for minerals soars, the continent stands at a historic crossroads: remain a raw – material exporter or move boldly into industrialisation, beneficiation, and advanced manufacturing. The 2026 Africa Energy Indaba will offer a platform for decision-makers to shape this future, accelerate value-chain integration, and drive sustainable, Africa-centred growth.",https://africaenergyindaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Critical-Minerals-the-Green-Transition.png,N,,2025-11-19 17:00:50.114286

U.S. Border Patrol agents stopped an immigrant worker Monday in Charlotte. The man showed agents a photo of his federal employment permit, but not the actual document. So they detained him.

The two attorneys at Tedesco Legal, a Charlotte firm that specializes in immigration law, took the man’s case pro bono on a referral from a fellow attorney. Late Tuesday afternoon, from their offices in a co-working space south of the city center, Mary Lynn Tedesco and Anna Cushman were still trying to figure out where he’d been taken.

A half-hour later, Cushman’s phone rang. She excused herself and hustled out of her office.

“That was the mom of the client that I’m trying to track down,” Cushman explained when she returned about five minutes later. “I told Mom, ‘I want to know where he is. If you get any information, let me know.’

“It’s a little bit of a shell game, because [immigration officials] can move them wherever they want,” Cushman said. “That ICE Detainee Locator would be the most official way,” she noted, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which is usually the agency that picks up immigrants in an inland city. “But I don’t necessarily trust things coming out of the mouths of ICE agents.”

In this case, the agency conducting sweeps is Customs and Border Protection, a different division of the Department of Homeland Security that does not follow the same protocols. Tuesday was the fourth day of what CBP has dubbed “Operation Charlotte’s Web” in Mecklenburg County. It also appeared to have expanded to the Triangle on Tuesday.

After less than a week in the Queen City, the “surge,” as DHS described it, had forced multiple businesses in Latino neighborhoods to close; led to a near-tripling of absences in Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools; and inspired protests and demonstrations.

Tedesco and Cushman are among dozens of local immigration attorneys fielding urgent calls, emails, and texts from panicked clients and their relatives, trying to give them the best information and advice they can in an ever-changing environment.

“You are on a long road in immigration. … But remembering it’s a long road is helpful, too, in times of crisis,” Cushman said. “We’ve been training for this since the beginning.”

DHS Claims 200+ Arrested in Charlotte

DHS said Tuesday that the Charlotte operation had detained more than 200 people since Saturday in what the department describes in a news release as an effort to “Target Criminal Illegal Aliens Terrorizing Americans.”

“I started getting emails about 8, 8:15 Saturday morning: ‘My brother was picked up. My dad was picked up,’” said Tedesco, a 36-year-old New Jersey native who opened her firm in 2020 and hired Cushman in September. “And these are existing clients.”

More followed, and she directed her paralegal to devote her time to fielding calls. The firm had about 250 clients, about a dozen of them pro bono; Tedesco and Cushman already had a full load.

By Tuesday, they were swamped. Cushman described their work as “frenetic.” Tedesco described falling asleep at about 9:15 p.m. Monday as she read a bedtime story to her 5-year-old daughter.

Cushman, 38, has twin 4-year-olds, a boy and a girl. She said she was up late Monday night and back up early Tuesday morning, toggling between posts to a Signal thread among immigration lawyers. “We’ve just got lots of moving pieces,” she said, “even on a normal day.”

Their advice varied with each client. But their basic message for anyone confronted by Border Patrol agents, Tedesco said: “If you’re documented, have your papers. Show that you are lawfully in the United States, and then say, ‘I am lawfully here in the United States. Am I free to leave?’

“If you’re not free to leave, you call us, because at that point you should be, in theory, entitled to a lawyer. If not, are there other violations of constitutional rights going on? Probably.” Undocumented immigrants, she said, should try to stay home unless it’s an emergency: “I’ve kind of told people to lay low.”

People who need an attorney, she added, can contact Carolina Migrant Network, a Charlotte-based nonprofit that provides legal services to immigrants in removal proceedings.

A few minutes later, Tedesco excused herself to catch up on “a stack of about 20 messages.”

The Cost of Confusion

Cushman is a Charlotte native whose paternal grandmother, Dr. Jonnie McLeod, founded what’s now a substance abuse treatment center network. “I love her legacy. She always saw the good in people, even in marginalized groups,” Cushman said. “So, for me, who is the group on the margins that I really want to make a difference for? It’s immigrants.”

Tedesco said she developed an interest in immigration law while in college at The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. She majored in Spanish, which required study of civil wars, drug violence, and American political intervention in Central America in the 1980s.

Both attorneys said they were somewhat accustomed to ICE detainers of one or two individuals. But the Border Patrol operation over the past few days has been much different.

“The tactics used by ICE to arrest and detain people are not the same as an indiscriminate, militarized group in vans and trucks going around and hitting people in public places,” Tedesco said. “It’s not the same large scale: ‘I’m gonna post up at a Home Depot parking lot and grab anyone who looks Latino.’”

DHS did not respond to a request for comment about their operations on Tuesday night.

And the attorneys still weren’t clear as of Tuesday about where people who are detained are being taken. Communication with them is limited or nonexistent. They named three ICE detention centers in Georgia and one in Louisiana where they believe DHS may be busing detainees from Charlotte, but they were still trying to confirm it.

They emphasized that even legal immigrants’ knowledge of their rights and the law is no guarantee that officers will respect them. Release without criminal charges from an ICE facility can take weeks or even months, irreparably damaging people’s lives, Cushman said: “You can’t un-ring the bell on the harm.”

This would be an expansion of the company’s magnet production capacity, establishing the world’s largest magnet factory outside China. The company has promised to create 1,000 new jobs in Johnston County. The company also recently announced a $1.4 billion partnership with the federal government.

“The confidence that Vulcan Elements has to expand to Johnston County is proof that we have the right assets to help innovative start-ups scale their businesses,” said Stein in a press release. “With semiconductor chips, batteries, and now magnets, North Carolina is building an innovation and manufacturing hub that will drive the economy of the future.”

The expansion will be partially funded by a Job Development Investment Grant (JDIG) approved by North Carolina’s Economic Investment Committee on Nov. 18. The project is estimated to contribute $2.6 billion to the state economy over a 12-year term. A formula that takes into account the new tax revenue generated by the latest jobs and capital investment, a potential reimbursement to the company of $17,584,500 over 12 years is authorized by the JDIG agreement. State payments are only made upon annual verification by the Departments of Commerce and Revenue that the company has met its job creation and investment targets.

“Today, we are the North American market leader in EV lithium-ion battery cells,"" says Yasuaki Takamoto, CEO of Panasonic Energy Corporation for North America.
Production at the Kansas factory benefits from more than 30 years of lithium-ion battery manufacturing experience and eight years of operational insights from the Nevada facility.
“The Kansas factory will build a sustainable future and provide more opportunities as Panasonic works to respond to global demand,” says Yuki Kusumi, Group CEO of Panasonic Holdings Corporation.","Electric vehicles (EVs) continue to play a crucial role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, especially from the transport sector, which produces about 23% of global emissions.

Of that, road transport makes up 69%, according to the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. That reality pushes companies like Panasonic Energy to strengthen EV supply chains while supporting decarbonisation efforts.

Panasonic Energy Co has opened its second North American automotive battery production base in De Soto, Kansas, producing cylindrical lithium-ion batteries, known as “2170” cells, for EVs. The factory joins the company’s existing Nevada site as part of a two-pillar strategy to anchor production in both Japan and North America.

The Kansas factory stretches across 1.2 million square metres, making it one of the largest EV battery manufacturing sites in North America. But beyond size, this facility marks a deeper investment in local supply chains, cleaner production and regional development.

“This factory will produce our latest generation 2170 cylindrical lithium-ion battery cells, and our customers will soon benefit from these cells produced right here in Kansas.”

Strengthening EV supply chains

Panasonic Energy's Kansas site reflects a shift towards a more localised and sustainable supply chain model.

With more than 80% of a lithium-ion battery's carbon footprint coming from upstream activities, such as raw material extraction and processing, the company targets local sourcing and material reuse to help reduce environmental impact.

The company aims to cut the carbon footprint (CFP) of its automotive batteries by 50% by fiscal 2031 compared to fiscal 2022. This includes introducing recycled materials, lowering use of rare metals and adapting production processes. CFP is measured by the total greenhouse gas emissions in CO2 terms across a product’s lifecycle.

Production at the Kansas factory benefits from more than 30 years of lithium-ion battery manufacturing experience and eight years of operational insights from the Nevada facility. Panasonic Energy improves factory productivity by 20% through efficient layout and automation. Battery capacity is also set to rise by around 5% thanks to new materials, keeping the company competitive in the expanding EV market.

The expansion supports Panasonic Group’s environmental strategy, “Panasonic GREEN IMPACT,” and its “CONTRIBUTION IMPACT” pillar, which focuses on reducing CO2 emissions within business activities.

“The Kansas factory will build a sustainable future and provide more opportunities as Panasonic works to respond to global demand,” says Yuki Kusumi, Group CEO of Panasonic Holdings Corporation.

“Through job creation, collaboration with academic institutions, and technological innovation, this factory symbolises building the future together with the local community. That is a source of pride for Panasonic.”

Economic impact and job creation

Beyond batteries, the Kansas factory delivers regional development on an unprecedented scale. This includes 4,000 direct jobs and around 8,000 additional positions through suppliers and affiliated companies. The annual economic contribution to the state reaches US$2.5bn.

Kristen Walters, Vice President of Human Resources at Panasonic Energy Corporation of North America, says: “We’re not just building a factory; we’re creating a future for generations of people, investing in talent and community to build the world’s most advanced technologies.”

Panasonic works with the University of Kansas and other local institutions to train specialists and develop battery technologies, addressing local workforce gaps and keeping skilled talent in the state.

In a region where agriculture dominates, many young people have previously left after college. Now, the factory offers them a reason to stay.

Panasonic’s community efforts include education initiatives supported by local officials, and outreach led by brand ambassador Katie Ledecky. Her visit to students at the Cedar Trails Exploration Center in Lenexa highlights the company’s focus on inspiring future engineers and scientists.

“Panasonic’s decision to locate this plant near De Soto is a stamp of approval we appreciate,” says US Senator Jerry Moran.

“This investment is a bright indication of what Kansans can achieve and will offer the world – creating new career opportunities in advanced manufacturing and technology.”",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/ec9cdb40f640f0e6a0ee6a4631182387:3f3c405ab7b75f2d82c427cfd336ca56/kansas-rendering-1.webp.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 15:01:21.770679

The new “American Energy Dominance” policy is purpose-built to throttle down on the two most available, economical, and accessible energy resources in the US — namely, wind and solar power. However, signs of a policy failure are already written on the wind, so to speak, as the demand for renewable energy shows no sign of slowing down.

The First-Ever Utility-Scale Wind Farm In Arkansas

This year’s abrupt shift in federal energy policy brought much grief to renewable energy advocates and investors, particularly in the offshore wind industry. US President Donald Trump has single-handedly pulled the rug out from under a bubbling pipeline of offshore wind farms along the Atlantic coast by deploying the federal government’s authority over offshore lease areas.

A few projects have managed to trickle through the blockade, but others gave up the ghost, the latest example being Invenergy’s decision to cut itself loose from the proposed 2.4-gigawatt Leading Light Wind project off the coast of New Jersey.

The onshore wind industry is in somewhat better shape, though not much better. Earlier this year, the President closed off federal lands to renewable energy developers. A growing web of state and county-based restrictions on wind and solar farms is also blocking the door.

Given those obstacles, the first-ever utility scale wind farm in Arkansas is a breakthrough moment for renewable energy, potentially signaling a fresh wave of growth shortly after — if not before — the current occupant of the White House leaves office as scheduled. On November 18, the Canadian renewable energy developer Cordelio Power announced the start of commercial operations for its Crossover Wind project, a 135-megawatt wind farm in Cross County.

Follow The Money

To be clear, the Crossover wind farm was already underway before the latest round of renewable energy restrictions entered force in Arkansas. Development of the site launched back in 2020 under the umbrella of Vestas North America through its Steelhead Americas branch, and then Cordelio acquired it towards the end of 2023.

Still, Cordelio’s Chief Development Officer, Nick Karambelas, made a point of thanking the Cross County community for its support. “Cordelio is committed to working with local communities within Arkansas to create economic growth and reliable electricity and Crossover marks an important milestone as we advance additional projects across the state,” Karambelas said in a press statement.

“We’re especially thankful for the strong collaboration from Cross County officials, landowners, and the broader community, which has been instrumental in bringing this project to life,” he emphasized.

If money talks — and it does — landowners in Cross County were listening. Collectively, they stand to haul in more than $50 million in lease payments over the lifespan of the project. Local taxpayers will also benefit. The project will pump about $950,000 per year into the coffers of Cross County for the life of the project.

More Renewable Energy For Arkansas

Arkansas lawmakers who voted for new restrictions on renewable energy development may be taking another look at their decision in light of the many dollars contributed to the local economy by the new Crossover wind farm. After all, times are tough. It’s not easy to pass up a new, risk-free, non-polluting source of local revenue.

Once the cash starts flowing from the new Crossover project, taxpayers in neighboring counties may start demanding answers from their elected officials. That remains to be seen, but Cordelio has already laid plans for additional projects across the state, as Karambelas mentioned. As for how many, that information was not released on November 18. However, one hint of things to come is the size of Cordelio’s renewable energy portfolio currently under management and operation in the US and Canada, which totals 1.86 gigawatts. That sounds impressive enough, but it’s a drop in the bucket compared to the company’s future plans for the US alone, with a development pipeline that currently stands at 18 gigawatts.

Cordelio is not the only renewable energy stakeholder to seek opportunities in Arkansas. In August, the Arkansas Times took a deep dive into the pushback against renewable energy in Arkansas, in which it referred to two additional utility-scale wind projects working their way through a maze of restrictions, including the nearly complete, 180-megawatt Nimbus wind farm in Carroll County.

The Nimbus project launched in 2016 under the umbrella of the firm Scout Clean Energy and is expected to begin commercial operations in 2026. When that happens, landowners will begin tapping into a total of $15 million over the life of the project, with another $31.5 million going to Carroll County. For the record, Scout’s development pipeline totals 19 gigawatts, eclipsing its current 1-gigawatt portfolio by a wide margin.

The Americas branch of the leading German firm RWE is behind the other wind farm mentioned by the Arkansas Times. To be located in Searcy County, that project is in the early stages of development, with land leases signed and public engagement underway. As reported by the Arkansas Times, RWE aims to build local support for the project by giving local officials and residents an up-close look at one of its many wind projects in Texas, where landowners and taxpayers are enjoying millions in new revenue.

Regardless of the revenue opportunities, that’s going to be a tough row to hoe. In addition to facing off against anti-wind activists in Arkansas who spent years honing their skills against the on-again, off-again Grain Belt Express, RWE may have to navigate state-based setback restrictions under the new Wind Energy Development Act.

On the other hand, Arkansas Times reporter Phillip Powell notes that RWE and local landowners may be able to weaponize the state’s “Right To Farm” law, which outlines the rights of property owners in regards to revenue-earning opportunities.

More Renewable Energy For The USA

Signs of recovering momentum are also evident in the US solar industry. In one particularly interesting bit of news, earlier today the Virginia-based startup SolaREIT announced that it has shot past the $5 billion project value milestone. The company specializes in helping renewable energy developers acquire the financing to procure sites for their projects. SolaREIT launched in 2020 with a single deal worth just $134,000. The company quickly raced up to the $3 billion mark last year and proceeded to pummel its way through another $2 billion in deals to date, bringing the collective generating capacity of its financed projects to 3 gigawatts.

REIT is industry shorthand for Real Estate Investment Trust, a type of real estate investment firm established in the 1960s to help make financing more accessible to small-scale investors. “SolaREIT’s financing solutions are designed specifically for solar and energy storage developers and asset owners looking to monetize land or lease value, reduce lease costs, or create liquidity for interconnection, equipment, and development expenses,” the company explains.

Hold on to your hats. Despite the partisan political headwinds blowing against renewable energy, SolaREITT CFO/COO Laura Klein does not foresee a hitch in the company’s growth curve. “Reaching this milestone so quickly underscores the strength of our model and the vital role SolaREIT plays in accelerating the nation’s transition to clean energy,” Klein explains.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/wind-farm-arkansas-cordelio.png,N,,2025-11-19 17:01:56.755244

Brad Schneider, released the following statement in response to the current status of permitting reform negotiations in Congress:

“The members of our respective caucuses hold diverse views of how Congress should improve the energy infrastructure permitting process; however, as leaders of these caucuses, we are unified in our belief that the current actions of the Trump Administration and Congressional Republicans are blocking us from engaging in good-faith, bipartisan permitting reform negotiations.

“Any serious permitting reform package must address—as a threshold matter—the Trump Administration’s active undermining of America’s clean energy industry by using every tool it can find to slow or block projects. The Administration regularly does not follow existing law, including revoking duly issued permits, rescinding previously awarded grants, and issuing stop-work orders on projects well under construction. Over the past 10 months, we have heard outcries over the Administration’s actions from state governments, businesses, and workers responsible for building critical clean energy projects to address growing electricity demand while improving the reliability and affordability of our energy system, but our Republican colleagues in Congress have remained largely silent in the face of the Trump Administration’s abuses.

“Ensuring that clean energy projects are treated fairly and can move forward where appropriate is the prerequisite for serious, practical negotiations on a reform package capable of meeting the nation’s energy needs. Additionally, to be comfortable with any sort of agreement, we need to be able to trust that this Administration is going to follow the law that we write.

The partnership aims to support the expansion of solar and wind energy while ensuring that the rapid growth of both industries aligns with environmental, social, and governance standards.

Both organizations said the memorandum of understanding seeks to address risks developing in renewable energy supply chains as countries accelerate clean energy deployment to meet climate goals. GWEC is developing the Wind Sustainability Initiative, a multistakeholder effort modeled on the SSI framework, to establish ESG and traceability standards for the wind sector. Under the agreement, SSI will share its experience in designing sustainability benchmarks to support the creation of the new wind-focused framework.

As part of the collaboration, the organizations will promote alignment between solar and wind ESG practices while allowing for sector-specific requirements. They will also support governance structures that involve industry groups, civil society, and financial institutions to improve supply chain oversight. Both initiatives aim to help suppliers, offtakers, and developers meet rising due diligence expectations as regulatory bodies in major markets adopt stricter disclosure and sourcing rules.

The partnership takes shape as governments require proof of responsible sourcing in solar and wind components, including minerals, metals, and intermediate materials. Developers and utilities increasingly face compliance obligations on traceability to maintain access to financing, tax incentives, and export markets. The organizations said harmonizing expectations across both industries will help reduce duplicative audits and ease adoption among suppliers operating in multiple segments of the renewable energy value chain.

Officials from both groups noted that the expansion of solar and wind manufacturing capacity has increased scrutiny of global supply chains. Several countries are considering new reporting requirements tied to human rights, emissions data, and environmental performance, creating pressure on manufacturers to demonstrate transparency. The partnership aims to prepare companies for these shifts and reduce the risk of compliance gaps that could affect project approvals.

The agreement also reflects growing emphasis on responsible growth in the renewable energy sector as markets integrate larger volumes of clean power. Industry groups argue that strengthening supply chain oversight improves long-term investment certainty, supports financing, and reduces the risk of sanctions or trade restrictions linked to non-compliance. By establishing shared standards, the organizations expect to streamline expectations for global suppliers and reduce fragmentation across markets.

Mexico stands to be directly affected by the push for supply chain transparency due to its role as a growing hub for renewable energy manufacturing and project development. The country hosts assembly operations for solar components, grid equipment, and wind-related manufacturing, and its industrial sector increasingly serves North American clean energy markets. As Mexico expands its participation in regional supply chains tied to the United States and Canada, it will face rising expectations to demonstrate traceability and environmental compliance in line with emerging standards.

Mexico’s energy sector is also seeing renewed interest in wind and solar deployment as large industrial consumers seek to meet emissions targets and secure long-term power supply. Harmonized sustainability benchmarks could help developers operating in Mexico meet cross-border reporting requirements and lower risks associated with international procurement. For manufacturers, the new partnership may accelerate moves to adopt ESG auditing practices and invest in transparent sourcing systems to maintain competitiveness in North American and global markets.

The agreement between SSI and GWEC is expected to influence procurement decisions across the region, including in Mexico’s industrial corridors, where companies increasingly rely on renewable energy contracts. As supply chain standards evolve, market participants in Mexico will likely face additional documentation requirements related to materials, labor practices, and emissions data. Industry groups in the country have already said that meeting international sustainability criteria is becoming a determinant for attracting investment, particularly in export-oriented manufacturing operations.

Mexico’s regulatory shifts, including new norms on energy planning and climate reporting, may align with the broader global trend toward verifiable sustainability metrics. Companies participating in Mexico’s renewable energy projects could benefit from having consistent and internationally recognized frameworks as they adapt to new expectations from global buyers and financing institutions.",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/2025-11/connected-logistics-and-supply-chain-concept-tabl-2025-03-10-13-03-54-utc%20%281%29.jpg?h=20141435&itok=OxX9kuQb,N,,2025-11-19 15:01:29.930317

As well as powering economic growth, the development of the hub supports the UK’s energy security ambitions and the drive for net zero. It demonstrates what can be achieved when organisations work together with a shared vision.

Delivery of our mission is all about freeing up our land so it can be used to benefit the local community, environment and wider economy and I can think of few better examples when it comes to realising that goal.

Energy Minister Michael Shanks said:

Chapelcross has powered the south of Scotland for decades and now is being given new life with this clean energy hub, creating jobs and revitalising local communities.

This is evidence of the UK Government’s clean energy transition in practice - creating good jobs and reindustrialising and investing in communities across Scotland and the UK

Chapelcross is a former nuclear power plant which forms part of the NDA estate, the body tasked by the government with decommissioning the UK’s earliest nuclear sites safely, securely and sustainably.

The focus of the CX Power development is 135 acres of the available land within the unlicensed landholding of the estate, adjacent to the former nuclear power site and wider nuclear licensed area.

Their plans include potential for a 1GW data centre campus with a zero-carbon target in its energy operation. The scheme looks to harness the 3GW of renewable energy supplies within fifty miles of the site and the 1.2GW of planned and consented wind and solar developments in the region. In addition, the data centres would utilise advanced cooling technologies that don’t place a burden on water resources and strive to achieve full water neutrality.

CX Power CEO, Graeme Anderson, said:

We’re thrilled to join the programme team. This is an opportunity to build a new economy based on the abundance of local green energy production. Embracing the UK’s natural wind and solar energy resources to actively support our national grid rather than burden it.

It’ll also open up opportunities for skills development and knowledge exchange creating a powerful force for change in the local economy, the Borderlands and Scotland.

CX Power join a number of strategic partners delivering the wider programme including Dumfries & Galloway Council, NDA, Nuclear Restoration Services (NRS), South of Scotland Enterprise (SOSE) and Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal.

Rob Fletcher, CEO Nuclear Restoration Services, commented:

The Chapelcross green energy hub represents a bold step towards a more sustainable future - and we’re proud to play our part in making that vision a reality. This programme is not only about transforming a former nuclear site, but about creating opportunities that will benefit communities for generations to come.

By working alongside CX Power and the strategic partner team, we’re helping to unlock innovation in hydrogen, advanced manufacturing and digital technologies, while supporting net zero goals. It’s a milestone that reflects collaboration, commitment and the shared belief that NDA land can power progress.

The masterplan will be a significant contributor to the 2045 Net Zero ambitions of Scotland and support Dumfries and Galloway’s ambition to achieve Net Zero by 2040.

Leader of Dumfries and Galloway Council, Cllr Stephen Thompson, said:

It is a testament to partnership working to reach this significant milestone in the development of Chapelcross.

We look forward to working closely with CX Power and our partners to deliver a project that will bring real and lasting benefits to Dumfries and Galloway. The Chapelcross Green Energy Hub will be able to create high-quality jobs and attract new skills to our area, but can also play a vital role in supporting our ambitious transition to net zero.

This is a unique opportunity to harness the potential of Chapelcross for communities, economy and environment, and we are committed to ensuring that local people and businesses are a key part of the positive impact this development will have for years to come.

South of Scotland Enterprise (SOSE) is also taking forward an Energy Transition Zone on land adjacent to the main Chapelcross site, which will aim to generate jobs and inward investment focussed on the transition to green energy production.

Jane Morrison-Ross, Chief Executive of South of Scotland Enterprise, said:

We warmly welcome the appointment of the strategic developer for the main Chapelcross site, marking a significant milestone for the South of Scotland.

Our region has seen a remarkable 400% increase in inward investment enquiries. The development at Chapelcross will be a cornerstone in attracting even more investors and creating new opportunities for our businesses and communities.

At SOSE, we are proud to be driving our Energy Transition Zone, which will help unlock the main Chapelcross site’s full potential. The progress with plans for a green hydrogen facility in the Energy Transition Zone is particularly exciting, and we look forward to working with all partners to deliver a sustainable and prosperous future for the region.

Chapelcross is a former nuclear power plant near Annan and is one of thirteen sites across the UK being decommissioned by NRS, a subsidiary of the NDA.

CX Power will be prioritising securing necessary planning consents and utility connections and undertaking market engagement. They invite stakeholders and interested parties to engage with them via enquiries@gaconsultants.co.uk.

The five-bill package, dubbed the “Frack Pack,” aims to hold oil and gas companies accountable to national standards for air and water quality.
It would also eliminate the so-called Halliburton Loophole, which has exempted fracking fluids from regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act since 2005.
The package will serve as a form of Democratic counterprogramming to House Republicans’ efforts this week to support oil and gas production.

A group of Democrats are reviving a package of bills that would tighten federal regulations for oil and gas drilling, in a rebuttal to expected votes in the House to shore up the energy industry this week.

The five-bill package, dubbed the “Frack Pack,” aims to hold oil and gas companies accountable to national standards for air and water quality. It would also eliminate the so-called Halliburton Loophole, which has exempted fracking fluids from regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act since 2005.

“What all of us are hoping is that this will make the oil and gas industry comply with the same environmental regulations as anybody else,” said Rep. Diana DeGette, a Colorado Democrat and the sponsor of the “Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals (FRAC) Act.”

“If we’re going to be drilling, and if we’re going to be leaning in on drilling, we need to make sure we’re not contaminating our aquifers with harmful chemicals,” DeGette said.

Bills in the Frack Pack, shared first with POLITICO’s E&E News, are sponsored by DeGette and Reps. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), Kathy Castor (D-Fla.), Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) and Yvette Clarke (D-N.Y.).

The package will serve as a form of Democratic counterprogramming to House Republicans’ efforts this week to support oil and gas production. Lawmakers are set to vote on a spate of Republican-sponsored bills and resolutions focused on refineries, gas exports and drilling restrictions.

But the Democrats' bills are unlikely to get floor votes this Congress. A variation of the Frack Pack was first introduced in 2009, and the bills have been reintroduced regularly since then without gaining much traction, thanks in part to strong opposition from oil and gas industry groups.

DeGette said the Republican majority’s expected opposition to the legislation is irrelevant to the stated goals of the legislative push.

“This Congress is the least productive Congress ever, I think, and the Republicans don’t seem to be prioritizing the environment,” she said. “But that doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t continue to push for environmental compliance, especially when we’re talking about safe drinking water.”

DeGette’s home state of Colorado was among the first states to implement hydraulic fracturing, the controversial innovation that drove a boom in American oil and gas production. A new oil and gas project proposed near her Denver district has generated local pushback over concerns about potential health risks.

She pointed to language in the ""FRAC Act"" that would close the Halliburton Loophole, requiring companies to publicly disclose which chemicals they are putting in the ground to help extract gas while authorizing EPA to regulate that process.

“The problem is, if you don’t have a disclosure requirement, you have no idea what is in this fracking fluid; you just have to go on the assurances that the industry is making,” DeGette said. “That’s not the way our regulatory system works.”

Another part of the package, the “Closing Loopholes and Ending Arbitrary and Needless Evasion of Regulations (CLEANER) Act” would eliminate certain exemptions under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and require oil and gas companies to clean up and dispose of more of their waste. The bill is sponsored by Castor, the ranking member on the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Energy.

The “Focused Reduction of Effluence and Stormwater Runoff Through Hydrofracking Environmental Regulation (FRESHER) Act” is sponsored by Huffman, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee.

It would require a study on the effects of stormwater runoff from oil and gas extraction sites. It would also require drilling companies to make plans to prevent that runoff from polluting streams and acquire certain permits.

Schakowsky’s “Safe Hydration Is an American Right in Energy Development (SHARED) Act” would require fracking companies to test for water contamination near their drilling sites and to produce reports on the impact their activity has on water quality.

The “Closing Loopholes for Oil and Other Sources of Emissions (CLOSE) Act,” from Clarke, would make oil and gas companies subject to the Clean Air Act’s aggregation requirement, according to a bill summary. It would also add hydrogen sulfide to the list of air pollutants considered hazardous under the Clean Air Act.

Researchers at Western University are advancing an alternative: solid-state sodium batteries.

Unlike lithium, sodium is abundant and widely available, making it a more accessible option for large-scale applications like electric vehicles and grid storage. The Western University team is developing a solid-state sodium battery that leverages a chemically engineered electrolyte designed for stability, safety, and improved performance.

The new electrolyte incorporates sulfur and chlorine to form a solid structure that allows sodium ions to move more freely — addressing a longstanding conductivity issue in sodium-based systems.

The researchers emphasize that solid-state configurations reduce the risk of fire while offering higher energy density potential — critical for sectors where downtime or failure isn't an option.

Advanced Tools Unlock New Understanding of Ion Transport

To validate the material's performance, the team turned to the Canadian Light Source (CLS), a synchrotron research facility at the University of Saskatchewan. Using high-intensity X-ray imaging, they were able to observe how sodium ions travel through the electrolyte at the atomic level.

This capability to map ionic movement in real time is helping researchers refine material properties faster than conventional trial-and-error methods allow. The ability to visualize conductivity mechanisms on such a fine scale not only benefits battery research but also has implications for broader fields like clean technology and advanced manufacturing.

A major challenge in solid-state battery design is compatibility between materials. Many solid electrolytes degrade when in contact with electrodes or other components. However, Western’s formulation has shown early signs of stability with common battery materials — a promising indicator for future scalability.",https://cdn1.creativecirclemedia.com/environment/original/20251114-105419-33e-curated-lifestyle-_GirzMqq1cY-unsplash.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 19:01:54.098656

“It’s really fantastic to have so many like-minded, ambitious individuals working in the same area,” Hackl said.
“What we are doing is truly in line with the history of Oakland,” Hackl said, referring to the role the railroads, the port, the steel mills and warehouses played in developing Oakland.","A once dreary corner of West Oakland — where the I-880 freeway collapsed in the Loma Prieta earthquake and industry fled over the decades — is becoming a bright spot in Oakland’s economic growth.

A hub of innovative manufacturing companies, with a focus on advancing climate technology, is springing up in old factories and warehouses. The new companies focus on sustainable materials, clean energy, construction supplies and waste regeneration.

It wasn’t by chance that these startups found a home in West Oakland. Developer, Joe Ernst, committed to Oakland, has converted the industrial warehouses into turnkey R&D (research and development) spaces. He and the City worked as partners, and the changes benefit not only the new businesses, but also the residents.

“I know it doesn’t look like it when you drive around, but there’s a lot going on,” said Lukas Hackl, co-founder and CEO of Aepnus Technology, one of the new companies, located on the Prescott Campus on Peralta Street.

“You see a lot of warehouses and some of them still look empty.”

Aepnus Technology is working on converting byproducts — essentially waste — from the battery and mining industries into critical chemicals that can be reused in manufacturing processes, sometimes in the very same industries that produced the waste.

“Many of our customers spend a lot of money getting rid of their wastestreams,” Hackl said. “Using our technology, we can hand back usable chemicals.”

A few blocks away from Aepnus, Longshot Space Technologies is developing what founder and CEO Mike Grace calls “the world’s largest gun.” Rather than bullets, the long gas-pressurized tube will hopefully one day sling everything from satellites to necessities for Mars settlers into outer space — without the need for rockets or massive amounts of rocket fuel.

“It’s like a giant potato gun,” he said, referring to a toy that uses air pressure to fire projectiles.

First came the developers

Reinvestment in West Oakland began in 2021 when the developer Joe Ernst with srmERNST began redeveloping industrial warehouses into what would become the Prescott Campus. Simultaneously, the developer SKB renovated the former American Steel factory into a Class A manufacturing and research and development campus, now home to several R&D companies.

“Joe initially reached out to us about our Business Improvement District program,” said Cristy Johnston Limon, Deputy Director of Oakland’s Economic and Workforce Development Department. “That’s a resource where property owners in an area vote to assess themselves to support extra services such as graffiti abatement, beautification and community events.”

“Our division quickly became a solutions partner to address everything from identifying the owners of railroad tracks that required removal, to stewarding a variety of permits through the City’s different departments,” she said. “Joe and his team activated 18th Street with a weekly farmer’s market, and ultimately launched the Prescott Market, a bustling food hall that serves area residents and workers, while providing a great meeting spot before and after Oakland Ballers games at Raimondi Park.”

Feeding the workforce

The Prescott Market, home to seven eating and drinking establishments, “is sort of becoming the watering hole for the area,” said Hackl from Aepnus.

“It’s really fantastic to have so many like-minded, ambitious individuals working in the same area,” Hackl said. “We can bond over what we’re doing, which is not easy.”

Other food and drink options have opened in the area — the popular June’s Pizza, Brix Factory Brewing, Soba Ichi Ramen, and Sun Moon Studio, which won its first Michelin Star this year.

Across from Prescott Market, Raimondi Park was a long-neglected Oakland ballfield that’s been renovated into a small but modern stadium, after City departments worked in partnership with area stakeholders, to clear a path for this community-driven project. It’s now home to the Oakland Ballers, the minor-league team that won the Pioneer League championship this season.

What drew the startups

One factor drawing the startups is the availability of affordable real estate and infrastructure, from transportation to electrical supply and wide streets.

“Oakland has a significant industrial legacy,” said Grace, of Longshot, “and a lot of that is still here. You can get a lot of stuff shipped in and out of here pretty easily, and there are lots of old warehouses and affordable real estate. It was pretty derelict for a while, but it’s attractive now.”

Another factor making West Oakland appealing is the abundance of engineers and entrepreneurs trained at UC Berkeley and Stanford.

“The key to startups is having talent,” Grace said, “and there’s a lot of talent here in the Bay Area.”

Much of that talent was honed in post-graduate fellowship programs that aim to transform engineers and scientists into entrepreneurs, said Hackl, a graduate of UC Berkeley and the Activate Fellowship program.

“You have a lot of smart minds shifting from academia to the real world of production,” he said.

Andy Zhao, founder and chief science officer at Limelight, said the area also offers proximity to national laboratories, technology innovators and venture capitalists as well as the innovative spirit of Silicon Valley, even for companies like his that are developing and using hardware more than software.

How the city helped

Climate tech is one of several growth sectors cited in Oakland’s five-year Economic Development Action Plan, accepted by City Council in October, said Ashleigh Kanat, Director of Oakland’s EWDD.

“Oakland’s growing climate tech industry is made up of local businesses and workers focused on protecting our city and the environment,” said Kanat. “Some are finding ways to cut pollution and capture carbon from the air, while others are helping our neighborhoods and infrastructure prepare for hotter weather, rising seas and other climate impacts.”

“This work isn’t just good for the environment — it’s creating new jobs, attracting investment, and building a stronger, more resilient Oakland for the future.”

Kanat said the city staff in Business Development regularly help climate tech and other businesses navigate permitting and regulatory requirements.

“For instance, in order to meet Aepnus’ aggressive startup timeline, the City worked with the property owner to fast track permits, pulling in staff from other departments to assist. Aepnus was able to move in and begin operations to meet their investors’ benchmarks.”

Reviving manufacturing

While the surge of advanced manufacturing businesses, like Aepnus, have a modern focus, they also harken back to the past.

“What we are doing is truly in line with the history of Oakland,” Hackl said, referring to the role the railroads, the port, the steel mills and warehouses played in developing Oakland. “I feel like what we’re doing is reviving, and revising, some of that.”

Andy Zhao, of Limelight, agrees.

“The place to do something revolutionary seems like Oakland,” he said.",https://oaklandside.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Longshot-CEO.png,N,,2025-11-19 18:01:36.942296

Clean energy groups are criticizing the Trump administration for holding up solar cell imports at customs, following solar panel maker QCells’ announcement of layoffs and furloughs at its Georgia factories earlier this month.

QCells manufactures solar panels at its two factories in Georgia but imports some components, including the solar cells that make up solar panels, from its factories abroad.

The company announced it’s cutting hours and contractor roles at its Georgia facilities due to customs delays.

Shipments have been held up at customs recently, a spokeswoman with QCells said, forcing the company to scale back production. QCells announced furloughs and reduced hours for about 1,000 employees earlier this month and laid off about 300 contractors.

Holding up solar imports at customs “is against President Trump’s stated goal of rebuilding American manufacturing,” Bentley Allan of the Net Zero Industrial Policy Lab at Johns Hopkins University wrote in an email to WABE.

Further import woes could be coming, Allan said, thanks to the foreign entities of concern provisions in the omnibus spending bill passed earlier this year, dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The law eliminates tax incentives for projects that get assistance from those foreign entities, and many solar advocates have worried that could be applied to all imports from China — a major source of solar panel components.

“A lot now hinges on how the Treasury Department issues guidance for these provisions,” Allan wrote. “If Treasury bars any and all components from China, it will severely hamper U.S. manufacturing for solar and batteries.”

Climate advocacy group Climate Power called the QCells customs delays part of a “war on clean energy.” The group has identified more than 158,000 clean energy jobs nationwide that it says have been lost or stalled due to other Trump policies, like cancelled grants and tax credits.

A QCells spokeswoman stressed that the company’s imports are eventually clearing customs, and she expects things to return to normal in the coming months. QCells also expects to import fewer solar cells once its Cartersville factory starts producing them next year.

Specifically, the bankruptcy code affords debtors the right to reject executory contracts (like PTC purchase agreements), provided rejection is in the best interest of the bankruptcy estate.
However, it is currently uncertain whether such attempts to classify PTC purchase agreements as forward and/or master netting agreements will prove successful.
At a minimum, PTC purchase agreements should include extensive representations and warranties, indemnity protections, and bankruptcy-related provisions.
Nevertheless, well-drafted bankruptcy-related protections can bolster a PTC buyer’s position (and rights to the PTCs) in the event of bankruptcy.","The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 created the ability to transfer production tax credits (“PTC”) to an “eligible taxpayer” pursuant to Section 6418 of the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”). However, exactly when an eligible taxpayer acquires a PTC is often not clear. Such uncertainty creates fertile ground for disputes, especially in bankruptcy.

PTCs arise under federal tax law, so it may be presumed that an eligible taxpayer does not acquire a PTC until the close of the applicable tax year (and then only when a return is filed). Moreover, an eligible taxpayer does not have the right to transfer a PTC until the following conditions are met: (i) registration of the PTC with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”); (ii) execution of a binding purchase agreement; (iii) generation of the PTC; (iv) filing of information pertaining to the PTC on a timely basis; and (v) filing of a transfer election statement with the eligible taxpayer’s annual return, which identifies the transferee taxpayer. See IRC, Section 6418.

Since PTCs are generated on a rolling basis as energy is produced, PTCs may be acquired from an eligible taxpayer for a single year, for multiple years into the future, or even for the life of a project. Such agreements are executory in nature (i.e., a contract for which there remains something to be done on both sides).

Furthermore, PTCs are not transferred contemporaneously with the execution of an agreement for their purchase, such transactions come with typical transactional risks that require extensive due diligence and careful purchase agreement drafting. Due to their executory nature, agreements to purchase PTCs have unique risks in the context of a bankruptcy filing by an eligible taxpayer. Specifically, the bankruptcy code affords debtors the right to reject executory contracts (like PTC purchase agreements), provided rejection is in the best interest of the bankruptcy estate. Thus, debtors/eligible taxpayers might reject purchase agreements and instead offer the subject PTCs to third parties willing to pay higher prices in order to capture greater value for the bankruptcy estate. Due to the existence of such bankruptcy-related risks, transferee taxpayers should consider incorporating provisions into purchase agreements to protect their rights in the event of bankruptcy. One option is to draft PTC purchase agreements in such a manner as to eliminate all future performance by transferee taxpayers, which would require significantly different structuring than current industry standards. With no future performance obligations, the purchase agreements would be non-executory and therefore not subject to rejection in bankruptcy.

Alternatively, parties have attempted to draft purchase agreements as forward contracts and/or master netting agreements to obtain the safe harbor protections afforded such contracts by the bankruptcy code. However, it is currently uncertain whether such attempts to classify PTC purchase agreements as forward and/or master netting agreements will prove successful.

At a minimum, PTC purchase agreements should include extensive representations and warranties, indemnity protections, and bankruptcy-related provisions. Given the extremely limited guidance offered by the courts, it is unclear whether such bankruptcy-related provisions will prove successful in the event of litigation.

The announcement follows confirmation of a $10 billion investment plan promoted last month by President Donald Trump, aimed at expanding Toyota’s domestic operations over the next five years.

Notably, Toyota Chairman Akio Toyoda drew attention earlier this month at a racing event at Japan’s Fuji Speedway, reportedly wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat and T-shirt featuring Trump and Vice President JD Vance. During the event, Toyoda hosted U.S. Ambassador George Glass and addressed questions about tariffs, saying he was not there to debate whether they were good or bad, but emphasized that national leaders naturally try to protect their own auto industries. He added that Toyota is seeking tariff strategies that benefit all parties, especially customers.

“The purpose of a public meeting is to provide the opportunity to submit comments or ask questions about the application,” according to TCEQ.
So far, the application has received 158 comments, 53 hearing requests, and 15 public meeting requests, according to TCEQ’s database.

The company Saronic Technologies applied to TCEQ for an air permit that would allow it to build an Autonomous Surface Vessel Manufacturing Facility located at 1312 Dalton Lane in Austin at the Eastside Commerce Center, just north of the airport, according to a TCEQ public notice.

Saronic Technologies produces three models of autonomous boats for the U.S. Navy. According to the Austin Business Journal, the facility would “enable Saronic to scale up its operations, as well as expand into new products and bring more operations in-house.”

A Saronic spokesperson shared the following statement in response to the group’s call to action:

“Saronic is dedicated to doing right by our community as we invest and grow in Austin. Our commitment includes meeting local health, safety, and environmental requirements, and working with local government and community partners to ensure our operations have a positive and responsible impact. We take our commitment to our employees, partners, and neighbors seriously.”

TCEQ’s plain language summary of the pending permit outlines what the facility will be used for and what air pollutants are expected to be emitted from it.

“This permit will authorize the production of surface vessels by use of gelcoat and resin spray application and curing, resin based adhesive use, cutting and drilling, and resin injection,” the summary says. “Saronic Technologies, Inc. has listed in its application the pollutants and amounts that will be emitted for each facility.”

According to the summary, the following Pollutant Proposed Emissions (in tons per year) are expected from the facilities:

VOCs: 50.12

HAPs: 43.85

PM: 0.001

PM2.5: 0.001

PM10: 0.001

PODER is concerned about the facility’s expected emissions, noting in a social media post that there are several child care centers, nursing homes, and hospitals within a 2-mile radius of the facility.

“Right now, it is the public comment period of the air permit, and we are in particular asking for folks to comment to ask for a public meeting,” Alexia Leclercq with PODER explained. “So essentially, when there is significant interest shown to the TCEQ that residents have concern about any facility or any permit, we’re able to get, you know, a public meeting.”

According to the TCEQ public notice on Saronic’s permit application, folks can submit public comments or request a public meeting about the permit application.

“The purpose of a public meeting is to provide the opportunity to submit comments or ask questions about the application,” according to TCEQ. “A public meeting about the application will be held if requested by an interested person and the executive director determines that there is a significant degree of public interest in the application or if requested by a local legislator. A public meeting is not a contested case hearing.”

A contested case hearing can be requested by persons who may be affected by emissions of air contaminants from the facility.

So far, the application has received 158 comments, 53 hearing requests, and 15 public meeting requests, according to TCEQ’s database. State Representative Lulu Flores was among those who submitted a public hearing request. Rep. Flores stated the following in the letter, which was addressed to TCEQ Chief Clerk Laurie Gharis:

Dear Ms. Gharis:

Several of my constituents have raised concerns to my office about the potential negative effects on the local air quality that could result from the proposed construction and operation of an autonomous surface vessel manufacturing facility in their area. The location of the facility would be 1312 Dalton Lane, Austin, TX 78742, and the operators, Saronic Technologies, Inc., have applied to TCEQ for an air quality permit. The proposed permit number is referenced above.

I understand that TCEQ has also received many public comments related to this project. To ensure that all stakeholders, including my constituents who live nearby, have an opportunity to be heard on this matter, I am requesting a public meeting regarding this application. I believe that such a meeting would be most productive if it were to take place after the draft permit became available, so I would further request that the meeting be scheduled for after that time.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Leclercq said PODER is requesting a public meeting so that residents who will be impacted by the pollutants would be able to voice their concerns and ask questions to TCEQ. She said it would also “essentially slow down the process of approval through the TCEQ and gives residents the chance to organize and really figure out what it is.”

Leclercq said PODER is concerned about the facility’s pollutants that will be created during the manufacturing of the boats, compounded with other pollutants and environmental concerns in the area.

“A lot of times, as an environmental justice org, we look at cumulative impact,” Leclercq said. “And so, for example, in that area, we already have the airport, we already have the Tank Farm. We also have the truck traffic. We have the highway expansion, and so we take a lot of that into consideration when thinking about the health of the communities in that area.”",https://www.kxan.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2025/11/IMG_1143.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-19 14:03:33.177248

To increase capacity of US-made solar tech by 3.7 GW, to hit total 17.7 GW in 2027.

Solar module developer

First Solar, headquartered in Tempe, Arizona, is to establish a new facility in Gaffney, Cherokee County, South Carolina. The firm says that the purpose of the new site is “to onshore final production processes for Series 6 Plus modules initiated by the company’s international fleet.”

First Solar expects to spend approximately $330 million to establish the new facility, which is scheduled to commence commercial operations in the second half of 2026. The facility is forecast to create over 600 new jobs with an average manufacturing salary of $74,000 per year, approximately twice the per capita income in Cherokee County, the firm says.

The South Carolina facility was catalyzed by demand for domestically-produced energy technology created by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law by President Donald J. Trump in July 2025.

‘American-made’

The facility is expected to increase First Solar’s capacity to produce “American-made solar technology” that is fully compliant with anticipated Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) guidance, by 3.7 gigawatts (GW), to reach 17.7 GW of annual capacity in 2027. Governor Henry McMaster of South Carolina commented, “First Solar’s investment will create 600 new jobs in Cherokee County, which will greatly strengthen the local economy and help advance America’s energy independence.”

The onshored processes will transform thin film solar cells produced by First Solar’s international fleet into fully completed modules. The new facility expands the company’s footprint in South Carolina, which currently includes a distribution center in Duncan, Spartanburg County, and a longstanding partnership with Inland Port Greer.

The Gaffney plant will be part of what the company calls “already the largest solar technology manufacturing and research and development footprint in the Western Hemisphere, including three fully vertically integrated manufacturing facilities in Ohio, and one each in Alabama and Louisiana, along with R&D centers in Ohio and California.”

Altogether, the company, which expects to directly employ over 5,500 people in the US by the end of 2026, will have invested approximately $4.5 billion in American manufacturing and R&D infrastructure since 2019.

“The passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the Administration’s trade policies boosted demand for American energy technology, requiring a timely, agile response that allows us to meet the moment,” said Mark Widmar, CEO at First Solar. “We expect that this new facility will enable us to serve the US market with technology that is compliant with the Act’s stringent provisions, within timelines that align with our customers’ objectives.”

Having manufactured in the US since 2002, First Solar is the only one of the world’s largest solar manufacturers to be headquartered in the US. By 2027, the company says it expects to support over 30,000 direct, indirect, and induced jobs across the country – “estimated to represent more than $3 billion in labor income”.",https://optics.org/images/favicon-16.png,N,,2025-11-19 13:02:26.407604

However, SB 100 was not just another RPS standard increase; it also required that all of California’s electricity be sourced by carbon-free resources by 2045.","Despite being an oil-rich state and ranking third in refining capacity behind Louisiana and Texas, California has surpassed even Hawaii, which imports practically everything, as the state with the highest average cost of a gallon of gas at $4.64 per gallon, and comes in third for the highest cost of electricity rates per kilowatt-hour (kWh) at $32.41 per kWh. Most of California’s problems, including and especially high energy costs, are self-imposed and make the state a prime case study of how misguided, idealistic policy can ruin even the most resource-abundant regions.

1970s, The Beginning

California’s alternative energy push dates back to the 1970s. This decade was wrought with multiple conflicts in the Middle East, including the Yom Kippur War of 1973, the Arab Oil Embargo of 1973-1974, and the Iranian Islamic Revolution of 1979. In particular, the Arab Oil Embargo put significant pressure on American consumers due to America’s heavy reliance on Middle Eastern oil. The supply shortages brought on by the embargo and the accompanying price controls occurred only a few years after the Santa Barbara oil spill of 1969, which, despite the majority of the cleanup being completed in 45 days, had soured public opinion of oil operations in California. This event spurred the beginnings of the environmental movement in California, and the compounded supply shortages caused by the Arab embargo pushed legislators even further toward forcing energy alternatives, leading directly to the creation of the California Energy Commission (CEC).

The Warren-Alquist State Energy Resources and Conservation Act of 1974, signed into law by Governor Ronald Reagan, established the CEC, which began operations in 1975. Born out of the chaos of the oil supply chain challenges, the CEC was tasked with “reducing energy costs, curtailing greenhouse gas emissions, and ensuring a safe, resilient, and reliable supply of energy.” Ironically, the most reliable source of energy, both then and now, in California, is conventional fuels, specifically, the plentiful in-state oil and natural gas reserves, which continue to be politically vilified and sidelined by renewable energy.

The end of the decade saw the implementation of the Public Utilities Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) of 1978, which has faced both praise and criticism. PURPA is federal legislation that was implemented — once again, out of concern for oil supply chain challenges from foreign sources in the Middle East — to encourage the development of renewable energy, reduce reliance on conventional fuels, and promote energy diversity. Instead of encouraging a solution developed through free-market competition to demonstrate the potential of renewable energy to both surpass and replace conventional fuels fully, the government initiative has turned into decades of subsidization in the form of tax credits and mandatory purchase rates from qualifying facilities (QFs) — defined by law as either a small power producer or cogenerator (their primary energy source must be renewable).

Supporters argue that it helped create the opportunity for developing renewable energy at scale and established and expanded the foundation for energy security. However, because of subsidization, interconnection challenges, and regulatory favoritism, PURPA encouraged rent-seeking rather than profit-seeking. Over time, renewable energy providers are now established enough, through government subsidization, to compete without mandatory purchase obligations. In 2020, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) took a step to address the new market reality and the concerns from utility providers by giving states a greater level of flexibility in how they implement the law, with a particular focus on setting the mandatory purchase rates. These changes, while welcomed by critics of PURPA, led many renewable energy groups to protest, arguing that it would hinder their ability to develop further, highlighting the question of whether or not renewable energy could survive and grow without government subsidies and mandates.

2000s to Today

In 2002, California enacted SB 1078, officially creating the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS), which set an initial requirement that, by 2017, 20% of all retail electricity sales be serviced by renewable energy sources. This legislation was instrumental in laying the groundwork for both the future expansion of the RPS as well as other green mandate initiatives. For example, as part of the renewable energy push, the California Solar Initiative was launched in 2006 as part of SB 1, providing financial subsidies for the installation of solar panels, especially in residential areas. This government manipulation of the market led to a massive increase in solar capacity, but came with a high cost and posed an unfair financial burden to non-solar users who were not able to afford them. Additionally, the following year, Assembly Bill 118, 2007, created the Clean Transportation Program, formerly the Alternative and Renewable Fuel and Vehicle Technology Program, as a means to fund the creation and market introduction of alternative fuels, other than gasoline, and electric vehicles (EVs). Assembly Bill 118 artificially created more support for renewable energy by promoting the electrification of transportation and by directly funding projects such as the California Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Project (CALeVIP), which sought to, but has ultimately failed, to create an interconnected network of EV charging stations to compete directly with the scale of gas stations.

In 2015, California continued its green energy crusade with the passage of Assembly Bill 802, which ultimately allowed utilities to offer monetary incentives for implementing what was argued to be energy efficiency improvements. The general goal was to further the transition to renewables, and its implementation reduced energy demand and enabled a higher proportion of the remaining electricity demand to come from renewables; such a reduction also inevitably reduces economic growth, and was another clear example of government interference and market manipulation. 2015 also saw the passage of SB 350, the Clean Energy and Pollution Reduction Act, which established new renewable energy goals and even more aggressive greenhouse gas reduction targets. SB 350 also increased the RPS requirement to 50% by 2030, and it was later increased to 60% in 2018 with the passage of SB 100, with 2030 still being the target year. However, SB 100 was not just another RPS standard increase; it also required that all of California’s electricity be sourced by carbon-free resources by 2045. The objective of California’s RPS is a classic example of government market intervention and, therefore, manipulation. By requiring a certain percentage of electricity to be sourced from renewables, Sacramento has taken away a significant amount of choice from Californians.

In 2006, during the passage and periodic expansion of RPS, Sacramento passed the California Global Warming Solutions Act, AB 32, which required that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions return to the levels of the 1990s no later than 2020 — this would have been a 15% decrease from the early 2000s levels. AB 32 was a prime example of government market manipulation, given how the legislation gave blatant preferential treatment to companies focused on renewable energy, even though they, too, were and are guilty of carbon emissions. Furthermore, the outcome of this piece of legislation, and those of a similar nature, inevitably resulted in higher costs for utility companies, which were passed down to the consumer in the form of higher prices. For this reason, in 2010, Proposition 23 was introduced in order to suspend the implementation of AB 32 until unemployment in the state was consistently below 5.5% for four quarters. Many of California’s energy policies follow a trend of focusing on lowering GHG, supported by the argument that adopting an entirely renewable energy economy would be the way to achieve the goal of both lowering GHG and fighting climate change. This rhetoric has led to the current self-inflicted energy crisis in California.

Since 2019, Governor Gavin Newsom has supported and signed into law numerous pieces of legislation that have taken the renewable push and forced displacement of conventional fuels even further. In 2020, Newsom signed an executive order that all new vehicle sales in the state were to be zero-carbon emission by 2035. By doing so, Newsom effectively eliminated all market choice for automobiles in California, allowing only EVs based on a flawed understanding of emissions; if EVs were a perfect or superior alternative to internal combustion engines, then the market would respond differently. Furthermore, what was clearly not taken into account in these directives was that California lacks the critical infrastructure and grid capacity to sustain an entirely electric vehicle consumer base.

The only way to expand EV capacity has been through market manipulation and government subsidization, both of which have severely increased the cost of living in California. Fortunately, much of these EV mandates were reversed on June 12th, 2025, when President Trump signed a series of resolutions that ended California’s plans to mandate that all new vehicles in the state sold beginning in 2035 be net-zero, rolled back Sacramento’s low-nitrogen oxide regulations for heavy duty-trucks, and rescinded the 2023 EPA waiver that at the time President Biden supported, allowing for California to enforce even stricter vehicle emissions standards then required.

Conclusion

Since the 1970s, California has incrementally expanded its mandate for renewable energy while ousting conventional fuels through both political rhetoric and unfavorable policies. By doing so, California has manipulated the market to favor renewable energy, causing prices to slowly rise over time to the point where the state now boasts some of the highest electricity and gas prices in the country. California’s history of progressive legislation favoring renewable energy is a clear example of the risks of government market intervention in determining winners and losers in business. Had renewable energy been required to compete on equal terms with conventional fuels, the free market would have responded accordingly, with either outright rejection or specific feedback on the innovations needed to make the technology viable for consumers. Instead, Californians are left with high prices and a lack of true free market choice, which, given the state’s vast resources and potential for increased pipeline infrastructure, could have made oil and gas both more accessible and affordable for consumers. Californians deserve to have more choice in their energy consumption, but unfortunately, it may have to get worse before it gets better.",https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bigstock-Solar-Panels-On-A-Background-O-346787059.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 21:59:49.599708

The 68-year old joins a crowded field of candidates seeking to replace Gavin Newsom, and in a statement released this week pledged to focus on the state’s intractable affordability crisis.

“Californians deserve a life they can afford. But the Californians who make this state run are being run over by the cost of living. We need to get back to basics. And that means making corporations pay their fair share again,” Steyer said.

With Newsom termed out from running, several prominent Democrats have entered the race, including former congresswoman Katie Porter; Xavier Becerra, a former US cabinet member; Antonio Villaraigosa, a former state lawmaker who served as the LA mayor; and Betty Yee, who was the state controller from 2015 to 2023. Congressman Eric Swalwell is expected to announce plans to run.

Porter was considered the frontrunner until October when video emerged of her appearing frustrated with a journalist during an interview with a local news outlet and threatening to walk out. In the aftermath of the incident, Republican Chad Bianco, the Riverside county sheriff who is running for governor, took the lead in polling. Steve Hilton, a former David Cameron adviser and Fox News host, is also running as a Republican.

Steyer is perhaps best known as one of the largest donors to the Democratic party and his 2020 campaign for president. The former hedge fund manager created NextGen America, a political action committee and non-profit, spending millions to mobilize voters on the climate crisis and reproductive rights, among other issues. He dropped out from the 2020 race after the South Carolina primary, where he came in behind Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders.

But he has remained an active supporter of Democratic causes. Steyer spent more than $12m in support of California’s recently passed redistricting measure.

In a statement announcing his plans to run, Steyer said he led “winning campaigns” for state legislation that raised the tobacco tax to support healthcare programs and a proposition that “closed a corporate tax loophole for out-of-state companies”.

“I wanted to build a business here. Now, it’s worth billions of dollars. And I walked away from it because I wanted to give back to California,” Steyer said. “I’ve taken on out-of-state corporations that refused to pay their California taxes. I’ve taken on the oil companies. I’ve taken on the tobacco companies. We’ve raised billions of dollars for California citizens, without charging California citizens a nickel.”

Steyer said that as governor he would lower utility costs, build 1m homes in four years, make pre-school and community college free and ban corporate Pac money in state elections.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ecd3238b3c5f4843433256deaa22ff4f3c9a276/378_0_3781_3025/master/3781.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ad6d20dec731e9445d4562a3189a2707",N,,2025-11-19 15:02:24.740097

WASHINGTON, Nov 18 (Reuters) – The CEOs of the Detroit Three automakers and a senior Tesla executive have been invited to appear at a Jan. 14 Senate hearing on the impact of auto regulations and vehicle prices, Reuters has learned.

General Motors GM.N CEO Mary Barra, Ford F.N CEO Jim Farley, Stellantis STLAM.MI CEO Antonio Filosa and Tesla TSLA.O Vice President of Vehicle Engineering Lars Moravy have been asked to appear at the previously unreported Senate Commerce Committee hearing that will review the impact of vehicle emissions and electric vehicle regulations on auto prices.

“This hearing will examine how government interference continues to make vehicles expensive and out of reach for American customers and how we can restore competition and choice,” Senate Commerce Committee chair Ted Cruz said in a statement to Reuters, noting the average price of a car has more than doubled in the past decade.

The administration of President Joe Biden sought to prod automakers to build more expensive EVs by offering tax credits and imposing new regulations that also sought to deter future gas-powered production but also argued consumers would save money overall by not having to buy gas and on repairs.

Stellantis said it got the invitation but did not comment further. The other automakers did not immediately comment on whether they plan to appear at the hearing.

It would mark the first time the Detroit Three CEOs appear before Congress since 2008 when the automakers sought emergency government assistance when the industry faced near collapse.

Automakers face other headwinds for vehicle pricing including tariffs on imported vehicles, parts, aluminum and steel.

Cruz led efforts in Congress this summer to win approval for a provision in a tax and budget bill to eliminate penalties for automakers not meeting U.S. fuel economy standards dating back to 2022. The legislation also eliminates up to $10,000 in interest on new car loans for U.S.-assembled vehicles for most buyers.

It’s a Faustian Bargain: Nuclear power for a moment, and radioactive waste forever.""","The U.S. Department of Energy has granted Constellation Energy a $1 billion loan to help finance the restart of the undamaged reactor at Three Mile Island.

Constellation is moving forward with restarting the reactor formerly known as unit 1 - Constellation rechristened it the Christopher M. Crane Clean Energy Center - after reaching an agreement in September 2024 to sell the energy produced by the plant to Microsoft for 20 years. The company, the largest operator of nuclear power plants in the country, hopes to have the 835-megawatt reactor on line in 2027.

Microsoft reached the deal to offset its energy needs to power its data centers in the mid-Atlantic region. The reactor can produce enough energy to power 800,000 homes.

When Constellation announced its intentions to restart unit 1, company president and CEO Joe Dominguez said tax incentives and other government guarantees would be necessary to complete the $1.6 billion project, which includes restoring the reactor, its turbine, generator and other systems. The reactor, which Constellation purchased in 1999, has been closed down since Sept. 20, 2019, with the company reporting that it had no longer become economically viable. The Microsoft deal, coupled with federal clean energy tax breaks and loans, made reopening the plant economically feasible, the company said.

Chris Rodgers, senior manager for generation communications for Constellation, said the Microsoft deal was the catalyst of the decision to restart the reactor, which he said was closed prematurely. Nuclear power has had a renaissance , spurred by increasing demands for electricity, making nuclear energy more economically viable. Once operational, Rodgers said, unit 1's power would bolster the grid's reliability and put ""downward pressure on prices.""

This is not the only time unit 1 was idle for a lengthy period or time. It was closed for refueling when a combination of malfunctions and human error caused a partial meltdown of TMI's unit 2 reactor, the worst nuclear accident in U.S. history. It reopened in 1985 after a lengthy regulatory review and legal battles fought by organizations seeking to keep it closed. Unit 2 is being decommissioned by its owner, Energy Solutions.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright was quoted in a news release as saying, ""Constellation’s restart of a nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania will provide affordable, reliable, and secure energy to Americans across the Mid-Atlantic region. It will also help ensure America has the energy it needs to grow its domestic manufacturing base and win the AI race.”

The energy department also viewed Constellation as a good credit risk. The company is valued at $106 billion and Rodgers said the company's ""entire balance sheet is behind this loan."" The company has pledged to pay back the loan, with interest.

Anti-nuclear activists, though, believe the deal exposes a flaw in relying on nuclear power.

""Nuclear power is an economic fiction that only functions through government bailouts,"" said Eric Epstein, who has run TMI Alert since shortly after the 1979 accident. ""Three Mile Island will have one client: Microsoft. This marriage between Microsoft and a zombie nuclear plant is exclusive, and benefits Microsoft’s facilities in Illinois, Virginia and Ohio. How does exporting TMI-1’s energy to another zip code keep the lights on in Pennsylvania?

The Environmental Protection Agency will proceed with tightened nitrogen-oxide emissions limits for heavy-duty trucks for the 2027 model year but is open to adjusting certain requirements, American Trucking Associations recently said in a communication to its members.

“We are encouraged by several proposed adjustments that should help lower costs and ease implementation,” ATA Vice President of Energy and Environmental Affairs Patrick Kelly said in a Nov. 17 message to federation membership obtained by Transport Topics, noting that the agency had informed ATA it “does not plan to meet” the federation’s request for a four-year delay of the rules.

In August, ATA asked EPA to delay the rule due to the potential for “substantial compliance costs and operational burdens at a time when the trucking industry is already contending with historically difficult market conditions.”

Kelly said that while EPA “does not plan to meet our full request,” he noted its planned rulemaking is “likely to eliminate the extended warranty periods set to take effect in 2027 and instead retain the existing warranty requirements, while also revising useful life standards and making other technical changes to the rule.” He stated that changes to the rule’s 0.035 g/hp-hr standard or an extension of the 2027 implementation date “will be outside the scope” of EPA action.

That said, Kelly in a message supplied to TT said ATA is appreciative of any EPA and Trump administration efforts that would aim to “reevaluate heavy-duty engine and vehicle standards to reduce unnecessary costs to new trucks. This action will help preserve trucking jobs and keep freight moving safely and efficiently.”

Kelly noted that heavy-duty truck emissions have been reduced by 99% since 1970 but stressed that “further reducing NOx by over 80% requires costly new emissions control equipment that remains untested in the marketplace.”

He also repeated ATA’s concerns about timing of the rule’s adoption.

“The underlying 2027 implementation timeline raises serious concerns for America’s truckers, as the rule is likely to drive up equipment prices at a time when the nation’s motor carriers are already bracing for steep increases,” he said.

EPA is expected to publish the updated rule in the Federal Register around March or April 2026 and make it available for public comment. EPA did not immediately respond to TT’s request for comment.

Earlier this year, the agency announced a review of a long list of earlier regulations, including its Greenhouse Gas Emissions Standards for Heavy-Duty Vehicles rules and its Heavy-Duty [nitrogen oxides] rule. The agency had called “problematic” regulations adopted by previous administrations that it argued “results in significant costs that will make the products our trucks deliver, like food and other household goods, more expensive.”

Excise Tax on the Table

Kelly stressed that ATA will “work with EPA staff to ensure opportunities to further reduce costs are maximized.”

A key and ongoing priority for the federation’s efforts on Capitol Hill and with the Trump administration is a repeal of the federal excise tax on new trucks.

Kelly stressed that the “new pain points” threatened by the upcoming EPA rule “are compounded by the punitive, century-old federal excise tax on trucks — a tax that adds thousands of dollars to the cost of every new vehicle.”

In March, a bill that would repeal the World War I-era tax was introduced in the House of Representatives. Rep. Doug LaMalfa (R-Calif.), a senior member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, reintroduced legislation he proposed during previous sessions of Congress. The bill would cancel the 12% federal tax, which is applied to certain commercial vehicles.

“For over a century, the federal excise tax on heavy-duty trucks has gone from a temporary wartime measure to fund World War I to an outdated tax that punishes truck buyers,” LaMalfa said. “This is the highest percentage-based tax Congress imposes on any product. This tax forces buyers to stick with older, less efficient models and makes it harder for truckers to modernize their rigs, holding back the trucking industry from updating.”

ATA was among those that praised the legislation.

Based on company research, the U.S. must add more than 1,000 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity within the coming decade to meet rising demand from AI, electrification and industrial growth

LAS VEGAS, Nov. 18, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Schneider Electric, a global energy technology leader, opened the company's Innovation Summit North America 2025 today, convening more than 2,500 business leaders and market innovators representing nearly every industry to accelerate solutions for a more resilient, affordable and intelligent energy future. The two-day summit (November 18–19) features technology showcases, partner announcements and new research designed to help organizations build ahead of demand and unlock new productivity with AI, software and services.

In his keynote address, Schneider Electric CEO Olivier Blum spoke to the evolving energy landscape, highlighting the company's continuing transformation to meet industry demands. He presented a forward-looking vision that further establishes the company's position as an energy technology partner.

Schneider Electric is advancing energy technology, the integration of electrification, automation and digital intelligence, across buildings, data centers, industrial applications and power grids. The company's open, AI-powered EcoStruxure™ Platform creates intelligent ecosystems to drive real-time insights, resilience, and efficiency.

""By converging electrification, automation and digitalization, we unlock the full value of energy, creating efficiency and sustainability for all,"" said Olivier Blum, CEO, Schneider Electric. ""As your dedicated energy technology partner, our role is to translate that vision into concrete solutions that help you rapidly digitalize and strengthen your resilience. Innovation Summit North America is where we bring this to life, moving faster from ambition to action, advancing Energy Tech together with our entire ecosystem of partners and customers.""

North America is entering a new growth cycle driven by AI workloads, re-industrialization and transport electrification. Much of today's infrastructure was not built to handle fast-ramping, highly variable demand, creating a gap between when capacity is needed and when it comes online. According to Schneider Electric's Sustainability Research Institute, grid instability costs U.S. businesses billions annually. The nation must add 1,000–2,000 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity per decade to meet demand from AI computing, manufacturing and electrification (one TWh powers about 90,000 homes for a year). Schneider Electric's call at Innovation Summit North America is for public and private partnerships to address the time to power gap by adding capacity closer to where it's consumed; using software and AI to unlock headroom, reliability and efficiency from existing systems; and modernizing grid operations so energy can be orchestrated at scale.

General Motors CEO Mary Barra, Ford CEO Jim Farley, Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa and Tesla Vice President of Vehicle Engineering Lars Moravy have been asked to appear at the previously unreported Senate Commerce Committee hearing that will review the impact of vehicle emissions and electric vehicle regulations on auto prices.

""This hearing will examine how government interference continues to make vehicles expensive and out of reach for American customers and how we can restore competition and choice,"" Senate Commerce Committee chair Ted Cruz said in a statement to Reuters, noting the average price of a car has more than doubled in the past decade.

The administration of President Joe Biden sought to prod automakers to build more expensive EVs by offering tax credits and imposing new regulations that also sought to deter future gas-powered production but also argued consumers would save money overall by not having to buy gas and on repairs.

Stellantis said it got the invitation but did not comment further. The other automakers did not immediately comment on whether they plan to appear at the hearing.

It would mark the first time the Detroit Three CEOs appear before Congress since 2008 when the automakers sought emergency government assistance when the industry faced near collapse.

Automakers face other headwinds for vehicle pricing including tariffs on imported vehicles, parts, aluminum and steel.

Cruz led efforts in Congress this summer to win approval for a provision in a tax and budget bill to eliminate penalties for automakers not meeting US fuel economy standards dating back to 2022. The legislation also eliminates up to $10,000 in interest on new car loans for US-assembled vehicles for most buyers.

The Trump administration has taken aim at vehicle environmental rules on a number of fronts. In June, Trump signed a resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act to bar California's landmark plan to end the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035 and two other vehicle rules.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said last week the administration will soon propose rolling back NHTSA fuel economy rules from the 2022 through 2031 model years.

Reeder, a former Deputy Chief of Staff at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has agreed to pay $21,773.95 to resolve allegations that he violated federal conflict-of-interest laws prior to his retirement from the agency in 2019.

Among other things, the Ethics Reform Act of 1989 prohibits executive branch employees from participating personally and substantially in particular matters that will affect their own financial interests or the financial interests of certain parties with whom they have ties outside the government, including any organization with whom they are negotiating prospective employment. The United States alleges that while serving on a two-year detail to a local university under the Intergovernmental Personnel Act agreement, Reeder impermissibly negotiated for employment with the university. Before and during the detail, the agency warned Reeder that he remained subject to federal ethics laws and that negotiating for employment with the university would create a prohibited financial conflict of interest. Despite these warnings, Reeder actively engaged in negotiations for a teaching position and extended his detail to finalize the university’s employment offer. Reeder failed to immediately disclose his negotiations to the agency as required and later filed a notification form with the agency’s ethics office that misrepresented the timing of his negotiations.

“The EPA Office of Inspector General takes allegations of conflicts of interest seriously and will thoroughly investigate potential misconduct,” said Acting EPA Inspector General Nicole Murley. “American taxpayers have the right to expect the highest standards of ethical behavior from federal officials. Any conflict of interest undermines that trust, and we are committed to upholding integrity and accountability at the EPA.”

At a recent UN Security Council meeting on climate and security, U.S. representative Dan Negrea criticized China over its carbon emissions, disregarding China's large population and development needs.

Geng Shuang, China's deputy permanent representative to the UN, responded to the allegations, saying that China, with a population of 1.4 billion and the second-largest GDP in the world, ""is contributing annually more than 30 percent to the world economic growth, and its per capita emission is not among the highest in the world.""

Geng critiqued the U.S. for undermining global efforts by withdrawing from the Paris Agreement twice and urged collaboration instead of blaming others.

In recent years, the U.S., the country with the biggest historical responsibility for the current climate warming, has dithered on its climate policy and reversed many significant decisions.

This year, under the Donald Trump administration, Washington withdrew from the Paris Agreement -- for the second time -- and issued multiple executive orders to lift restrictions on domestic coal development while expanding oil and gas production.

An analysis led by researchers from Princeton University suggests that this reversal of climate policies will cause the U.S. to emit an additional 470 million tonnes of greenhouse gases annually over the next decade.

On the issue of climate, the U.S. has not only let the world down by refusing to shoulder its share of the responsibilities but also deliberately obstructed the efforts of others.

According to Politico, the U.S. government is leveraging its trade influence to coerce the EU, Japan and others into purchasing American oil and natural gas. It is also deliberately deploying diplomatic tools to prevent other countries from reducing the use of fossil fuels.

During the International Maritime Organization meeting in October, the U.S. delayed the implementation of a proposed global carbon tax on shipping by threatening and pressuring the negotiators from other countries.

According to a commentary in npj Climate Action, an open-access journal published by Nature, U.S. climate actions not only undermine decades of progress in transitioning to clean energy but also pose a direct threat to the global community’s ability to limit global warming to 1.5–2 °C.

The commentary, published in July, was authored by Carlos Garcia-Soto, a senior researcher at the Spanish National Research Council.

Unlike the U.S., China is firmly advancing the transition to renewable energy and improving climate governance. It is also exporting clean energy technologies and products and leading the global decarbonization process.

According to the global energy think tank Ember, China is the world’s largest investor in clean energy, with an investment of $625 billion in 2024, accounting for 31 percent of the world’s total.

In 2024, clean energy accounted for 84 percent of China’s electricity growth, and clean energy generation in the first half of this year increased by 27 percent year on year.

From 2022 to 2024, China’s installed capacity of wind and solar power surged from 635GW to 1,408GW. In 2025, the total installed capacity of China’s wind and solar power will surpass coal power.

According to a study by the Brussels-based economic think tank Bruegel, China is vital especially for renewable energy products, manufacturing 92 percent of the world’s solar modules and 82 percent of wind turbines as of 2024. China’s production of green energy technologies not only meets its own rapid renewable energy installation needs but is also expected to meet the production capacity required for global decarbonization.

In July, the UK-based Carbon Brief website reported that China’s exports of solar panels, batteries, electric vehicles and wind turbines in 2024 will prevent an estimated 220MtCO2 annually when put into operation overseas.

In sub-Saharan Africa, China’s clean-energy exports in 2024 alone are set to cut annual emissions by around three percent per year, and by around 4.5 percent in the Middle East and North Africa region.

Responding to the climate crisis is a global consensus, and developing clean energy represents the trend of the times. The international community can clearly see who is taking responsible action and who is shifting responsibility, who is seeking cooperation and who is making trouble on the issue of climate change.

The battery-electric horseless carriage is a vehicle that hearkens back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Mayor Eric Adams threw his support behind animal-rights activists who want to retire the horses and help carriage drivers transition to electric alternatives.

[Update November 19th: NYC’s proposed horse-drawn carriage ban fails in City Council committee hearing.]

A bill before the New York City Council would have wound down the horse-drawn cab industry by prohibiting the issuance of new licenses for such operations, which are sometimes referred to incorrectly as hansom cabs. (A hansom cab is a horse-drawn, two-wheeled carriage with a distinctive high-backed seat for the driver located at the rear, allowing passengers to sit in a low, two-seat compartment entered from the front.)

This bill would require humane removal of carriage horses, prohibiting their sale or transfer for the purposes of slaughter or use with another horse-drawn carriage.

Currently, there are approximately 1,024 electric yellow cabs in the city, representing about 7% of the total New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission medallions—a figure that hovers around 13,942. Various sources show that there were approximately 800 electric yellow cabs before the start of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, or around 6.5% of the total. That’s far from the percentage of electric taxis the industry had 125 years ago, which was 90% of the total.

The first electric taxis were introduced in the Big Apple in 1897 and by 1900, nine out of 10 taxis were operating on battery power. The technology was not quite ready for widespread deployment and operation, however, and two events led to a resurgence in the use of horse-drawn carriages and internal-combustion engine (ICE) powered taxis became the standard.

One event with immediate effect was a major fire in 1907 that destroyed part of the fleet of the Electric Carriage and Wagon Company, a New York-based electric taxi service that operated the largest electric taxi fleet in the city, leading to its collapse.

The second was the Panic of 1907, also known as the Bankers’ Panic or Knickerbocker Crisis, a three-week-long financial crisis that took place in the US in mid-October, when the New York Stock Exchange suddenly fell almost 50% from its peak the previous year.

Meanwhile, what remained of the electric-taxi industry in New York City lost ground to gasoline-powered taxis. Harry N. Allen famously ordered 65 gas-powered automobiles from France, painted them red and green, and the New York Taxicab Company—which charged passengers based on metered fares—was born. Allen took this action after having to pay a five-dollar (equivalent to $171 in 2024) fare for a quarter of a mile ride in a hansom cab. He painted his fleet yellow a year or so after starting the business to improve visibility, setting a color standard that has endured through the years.

Tourists in coming years might find themselves taking leisurely rides through the park in a horseless carriage, according to industry experts.

“While horse-drawn carriages have long been an iconic fixture of Central Park, they are increasingly incompatible with the conditions of a modern, heavily-used urban green space,” Mayor Adams said. “It has become abundantly clear that these horse-drawn carriages no longer work for our city.”",https://chargedevs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AdobeStock_273233016.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 18:01:31.801530

READ: Left-Leaning Think Tank Shows Working Families Tax Cuts Make Tax Code More Progressive","WASHINGTON, D.C. – The working families tax cuts provides the largest benefit to middle-income Americans, finds a study from the Tax Foundation. The middle 60 percent of earners will see the largest changes in after-tax income for 2025 and 2026, while the top 20 percent will pay a greater share of the income tax burden.

“The working families tax cuts prioritize the working men and women who keep this country running and thriving. For years, families were crushed by the high cost of living created by the failed economic policies of the Biden Administration which rewarded the wealthy and well-connected. Republican policies are tailor-made to put more money back in the pockets of working families – including, a larger Child Tax Credit, no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security, as well as more help with child care, health care, and education expenses” said Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith (MO-08). “Just like we did with the 2017 Trump tax cuts, Republicans took more of the tax burden off the shoulders of hard-working Americans. Republicans are truly the party of the working class, waitresses, welders, seniors, and parents.”

Study Highlights

Top 20 percent pay more of the tax burden: The top 20 percent of earners will pay an increased share of all federal income taxes in 2026, just like they did after the 2017 tax law.

Working families tax cuts give the most to the middle: After-tax income increases the most for the middle 60 percent of income earners in 2025 and 2026.

Second time Republicans made the tax code fairer: The 2017 Trump tax cuts made the tax code more progressive. The working families tax cut made those tax cuts permanent.

Economic growth helps all Americans: Economic growth sparked by pro-growth tax policy in the working families tax cuts boosts incomes for all levels.

After-tax income rises for all Americans: After-tax income increases for all income levels for an average of 2.9 percent and 5.4 percent in 2025 and 2026, respectively. A separate Tax Foundation study found that Democrats’ signature tax law, the so-called Inflation Reduction Act, had the opposite effect and shrank incomes for every income level in the long-run.

Other distributional analyses of tax relief enacted by Republicans have produced similar conclusions: working families tax cuts favor middle-income earners. A left-leaning think tank found that the top 1 percent of earners will pay a higher share of federal income taxes while the lowest 20 percent of earners will get the largest reduction in taxes of any income group.

Dive Brief:

Toyota Motor is investing $912 million over the next five years in its U.S. manufacturing operations to boost hybrid vehicle production, the company announced in a Nov. 18 press release.

The investments will add over 250 new jobs and be distributed among five of the automaker’s U.S. plants in Georgetown, Kentucky; Blue Springs, Mississippi; Buffalo, West Virginia; Jackson, Tennessee; and Troy, Missouri.

The investments are part of a larger $10 billion commitment that Toyota announced on Nov. 13 to increase vehicle manufacturing in the United States. It also includes ramping up domestic production of lithium-ion batteries for its electrified vehicles.

Dive Insight:

Hybrid vehicles, which are more affordable for consumers and more profitable for automakers to produce compared to fully electric vehicles, continue to serve as a bridge for Toyota and other automakers while they pursue their more long-term electrification goals.

Honda Motor Co., for example, announced in May that it is reducing its investments in electric vehicles by $20.7 billion in order to focus on launching new hybrid models. The automaker believes that its next-generation hybrid models will be integral in its long-term transition to EVs.

Toyota said its $10 billion commitment in U.S. manufacturing is part of its “best-company-in-town” multi-pathway strategy of investing locally and producing a mix of vehicles tailored to the needs of regional markets. But Toyota continues to grow its hybrid vehicle sales as demand for these models increases.

The company sold over 1 million electrified vehicles in 2024, the highest in company history. During its earnings call earlier this month, Toyota reported that sales of electrified vehicles, including hybrids, accounted for 46.9% of its global retail sales volume in the first half of FY2025, driven primarily by strong hybrid-electric (HEV) demand in North America.

The largest investment among Toyota’s five U.S. plants ($453 million) will be in Buffalo to increase output of 4-cylinder engines for hybrid vehicles, as well as the automaker’s sixth-generation hybrid transaxles and rear motor stators. Production is slated to begin in 2027. The plant currently assembles more than 1 million engines, transmissions and hybrid transaxles a year, according to Toyota.

“We are proud to see Toyota continue to grow in the Mountain State as they build world-class technology and drive the future of American manufacturing,” West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a statement.

A $204.4 million investment is also being made in Toyota’s Georgetown plant to install new machinery to produce 4-cylinder engines for hybrid vehicles, beginning in 2027. The Georgetown plant is Toyota’s largest global production facility and has the capacity to manufacture up to 700,000 units annually, per the release.

“I commend Toyota for their strong commitment to American workers through their new, $912 million investment in the United States, including $204.4 million for the Georgetown plant right in the heart of Kentucky,” said U.S. Rep. Andy Barr, R-Ky., in a statement. “Toyota’s expansion across the country will create hundreds of good-paying jobs, strengthen America’s manufacturing base, and drive economic growth in our communities.”

A $71.4 million investment in Toyota’s casting plant in Jackson will be used to increase production of hybrid transaxle cases, housings and engine blocks for hybrid vehicles. The automaker will also invest $57.1 million in its Troy casting plant to manufacture engine cylinder heads for hybrid vehicles beginning in 2027.

Chinese models dominate overall EV and PHEV sales, though, as they expand into Europe and South America.

The Geely Genome Xingyuan is a burgeoning rival to the BYD Seagull.

Tesla’s electric vehicle market share in the U.S. nearly halved in the third quarter of this year (32%) from its peak (62.8%) in 2020. But despite the tumult at the company amid its pivot to robotics and AI, its two mass-market EVs are still global favorites.

The world’s top two best-selling EVs in the first nine months of 2025 were still the Tesla Model Y and Model 3, market research firm Autovista24 said in a new report citing EV Volumes data. The other eight in the top ten best-selling EVs list were all Chinese models. The country’s plug-in hybrids are in a different league, with no Western model making the top ten PHEV list.

""Tesla controlled the top two positions in the global BEV market nine months into 2025. The Model Y accounted for an unchallenged 8.3% of all-electric car sales,"" the report said.

From January to September 2025, Tesla sold 808,173 Model Ys globally. A whopping 145,000 units were sold in September alone, likely supercharged by a massive uptake in the U.S. due to the end of the $7,500 federal credit at the end of that month. In terms of global EV sales, no other model even came close, which just shows how much the electric crossover still dominates sales charts in its fifth year on sale.

The Model 3 ranked at a distant second with 369,756 sales worldwide, followed closely by the Geely Geome Xingyuan with 343,514 units sold. The Geome Xingyuan is a compact electric hatchback sold in China, which starts at just $9,260 (68,800 yuan), and is a burgeoning rival to the popular BYD Seagull—also called Dolphin Surf in some markets—which ranked fourth with 292,579 units sold. The Wuling Mini electric city car rounded out the top five.

The fact that eight of the world’s top ten best-selling EVs are Chinese—even though the Teslas still rank at the top—may be a wake-up call for the American company. Passenger vehicles, not humanoid robots or robotaxis, are still the company's bread and butter. Moreover, in the U.S., EV sales are hitting a major reset after the end of the tax credits and the rollback of the fuel economy rules. This is a big problem for other American, European, Japanese and Korean car companies, too, as none of them are even on the top-ten list at this point, and selling EVs just got harder in their biggest market.

Another segment where Chinese automakers have comfortably consolidated their dominance is plug-in hybrids. All top ten PHEVs sold globally so far this year have been Chinese models, with no Western model even making the list. The BYD Song Plus crossover—also called Seal U in some markets—amassed 262,445 sales globally between January and September this year. The BYD Qin Plus, Song Pro, Seal 6 and Li Auto L6 round out the world’s top five best-selling PHEVs.

And even though a single BYD model isn’t selling as well as the Tesla Model Y, the company is comfortably ahead in terms of combined sales across its portfolio, accounting for 19.3% of the global EV market share, which also includes PHEVs and extended-range models. Tesla ranked a distant second with its diminishing 8% market share, followed by Geely (5.6%), Wuling (3.8%) and Volkswagen (2.8%).

While the Model Y might continue to hang on to its lead this year, the Model 3’s second-place finish at the end of the year is all but certain. The Xiaomi SU7 has been on sale for just over one year, but is already one of the world’s top-selling models. Geely also launched an updated model of the Geome in October in China with snazzier styling, more features and more trims on offer.

Unless Tesla achieves a breakthrough in its Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology that would prompt more buyers to purchase its cars, or surprises us with a new model to take on these Chinese EVs, its lead may continue shrinking in the coming months.

On today’s episode of Inside Automotive, Urban Science’s Global Lead for Advanced Analytics, Tom Kondrat, shares market insights and what dealers should be aware of as the new year approaches.

It has been a rollercoaster year for electric vehicles. Leading up to the sunset of the federal tax incentive, EV sales increased by 30%, achieving a 12% market share.

Sign up for CBT News’ daily newsletter and get the latest industry stories delivered straight to your inbox.

Now that the incentives have expired, battery-electric vehicle (BEV) sales dropped 45% in October, and market share shrank to 5%. According to Kondrat, these results are not unexpected given the heavy pull-ahead purchasing earlier in the year.

BEV demand also varies significantly by geography. In the Midwest, demand remains softer, leaving many dealers with inventory on their lots. In Florida and California markets, the conversation is much different.

Plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) have consistently accounted for roughly 2% of the industry’s market share, a small fraction of overall sales. This segment fell about 50% in October following the expiration of the federal tax credit. Hybrids, however, were up 15%. Since hybrids were not included in the federal rebate, their performance gives a more transparent snapshot of natural consumer demand.

The typical EV buyer tends to be carbon footprint-conscious and prefers smaller or mid-sized vehicles. As a result, larger all-electric SUVs and pickups have struggled to gain traction with mainstream buyers. Vehicles such as the Tesla Model Y and Ford Mustang Mach-E align more closely with the profile of prospective EV customers and have seen greater sales success.

Many industry professionals believe that without federal incentives, Tesla is positioned to emerge as the strongest performer. Tesla recorded its best sales month in August and maintained strong performance in September, giving the automaker a stronger head start over the competition.

Kondrat also points to a regulatory topic that remains underdiscussed but has significant implications for the industry. The Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) rules shaped manufacturers’ long-term strategies, and they invested substantial capital to comply with the standards. Under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, manufacturers will no longer face a financial penalty for noncompliance.

Vehicle affordability remains a pressing concern. Despite the average transaction price of a new vehicle exceeding $50,000, consumer demand remains strong. Urban Science found that many shoppers continue to upgrade to larger vehicles. However, October brought a notable shift. Luxury sales declined 11%, compared with the broader retail industry’s 6.5% drop, signaling potential weakness at the upper end of the market.

""Whenever you have sales spikes, you usually have some secondary effect, and that's what we're seeing. But the state of the industry is strong and we'll continue to hum along.""

Despite the year’s challenges, the industry remains up 4% year-over-year and is on track to close out 2025 ahead of last year’s results.

Since the announcement of auto tariffs, the number of vehicles sold that are final-assembled in the United States has increased. In October, U.S.-assembled vehicle sales rose 16% year-over-year. Sales of European and Asian-assembled vehicles declined 16%. Canadian and Mexican-assembled vehicle sales increased modestly by 3%. Kodrat says this shift is primarily driven by decades of foreign investment in U.S. manufacturing capacity.

Looking ahead, Urban Science forecasts that the fourth quarter will close down 5%. While it may appear pessimistic, Q4 2024 delivered a powerful 16.5 million SAAR. A 5% decline keeps the industry in the 15 to 16 million range, which reflects solid performance. Full-year results are expected to land slightly above 16 million units.

Urban Science predicts the first quarter of 2026 will align with historical norms. Analysts are watching closely for a rebound in BEV sales as consumers who did not purchase early return to the market. While some expect that rebound to begin in early 2026, Kondrat believes it’s more likely to occur in the spring, when BEVS sales typically strengthen.",https://d9s1543upwp3n.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/11.19.25TomKondrat-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 12:04:54.548921

It fuels businesses, supports families, and gives communities the foundation to grow.

Nowhere is that clearer than in South Carolina, where record population growth and major industrial expansion are pushing electricity demand to unprecedented levels.

Yet many projects that could expand supply and strengthen the grid are stuck waiting on approvals that take years to complete.

These delays stem largely from federal reviews that move far slower than the needs of fast-growing states like South Carolina.

The longer they wait, the higher costs climb for everyone.

The issue is not a lack of investment or ingenuity. South Carolina has become a national magnet for advanced manufacturing, electric vehicle production, aerospace suppliers, and next-generation logistics.

BMW’s continued growth in Spartanburg, Bosch’s battery component expansion, new industrial parks in Greer, Gaffney, and Laurens County, and a wave of suppliers serving Siemens and GE Vernova all depend on a modern, reliable grid.

But the bureaucratic process that governs the infrastructure needed to power these projects, transmission lines, substation upgrades, and grid interconnections moves too slowly and has become overly complex.

Developers often face overlapping reviews, shifting requirements, and legal challenges that can drag on for years.

The 732-mile TransWest Express transmission line from Wyoming to Nevada, for example, took nearly 18 years just to secure permits before breaking ground.

Duke Energy shuffles costs to make proposed Carolinas merger more attractive to SC

To support BMW expansions, battery component suppliers, and new industrial development corridors along the Interstate 85 spine, Duke Energy needs timely approvals for new substations, high-voltage transmission lines, and large-scale grid upgrades that often take longer to permit than to construct.

When these projects stall, reliability and affordability for families and businesses are put at risk.

When projects take too long to build, communities lose out on affordable power, new jobs, and private investment.

According to the global consulting firm McKinsey & Company, as much as $1.5 trillion in infrastructure investment nationwide is tied up in the federal permitting process. A meaningful share of that investment is aimed at fast-growing states like South Carolina — if the infrastructure can actually be built.

Permitting reform is about restoring common sense. It means keeping environmental standards strong while making the approval process clear, efficient, and predictable.

The goal is not to cut corners, but to cut confusion.

That can be done by establishing firm timelines so projects can move from proposal to construction without endless waiting; designating a single coordinating agency to avoid duplicative reviews; prioritizing high-impact projects such as Upstate transmission upgrades; and creating a clear judicial review process so infrastructure that meets every requirement is not stuck in court for years.

Streamlining the process would save time and money without weakening safeguards. Federal reforms are especially important because many transmission projects require approvals from

multiple federal agencies before South Carolina utilities can even begin construction.

Today, a routine transmission line needed to power a new industrial supplier in Spartanburg County can take years longer to approve than to build. Substation upgrades serving fast-growing communities around Greer, Powdersville, and the western Upstate must often navigate multilayered reviews that move more slowly than the growth they are intended to support.

With targeted reforms, builders could move forward with confidence, and communities would benefit from lower costs and greater reliability as new energy sources and delivery systems come online sooner.

Permitting reform also strengthens America’s energy independence, and South Carolina’s competitiveness.

Much of the region’s electric grid is operating with equipment deep into the second half of its lifespan, even as demand accelerates. Federal energy analyses show that the United States will need to double the size of its electric grid by mid-century to support artificial intelligence, manufacturing, electric vehicles, and population growth, all trends already reshaping South Carolina.

When infrastructure can be built faster, energy becomes more affordable and more secure. Local industries, from battery manufacturing in the Midlands to aerospace and advanced-materials

suppliers across the Upstate, can expand with confidence.

And new employers deciding where to invest will see a state prepared for continued growth, not constrained by outdated processes.

Modernizing how projects are approved is not a partisan issue. It is a practical step toward a stronger economy and a more resilient energy system. Families deserve affordable electricity and

reliable service, and they deserve a government that helps make that possible.

The time to act is now. Modernizing the federal permitting process will lower costs, strengthen reliability, and keep energy affordable for every family and business in South Carolina.

Cutting red tape is not just good policy. It is essential to keeping our state’s momentum moving forward.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47658/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/transmission-lines-closeup-1024x5761763567353.jpg?h=c12e0b96&itok=872-yBh1,N,,2025-11-19 12:06:47.965509

By doubling down on hybrids, Toyota is addressing immediate consumer demand for practical, scalable solutions while maintaining the flexibility to adapt to future advancements in electrified mobility.","The global automotive industry is undergoing a significant shift as battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) continue to gain traction. According to the IEA, in 2025, electric car sales are expected to increase by 25% globally, similar to the growth rate in 2024, driven by regulatory mandates, environmental concerns, and advancements in battery technology. However, challenges such as limited charging infrastructure, battery costs, and supply chain constraints for critical materials like lithium and cobalt remain significant barriers to widespread adoption.

Amid these hurdles, hybrid vehicles emerge as a practical solution, serving as a vital bridge between traditional internal combustion engines (ICE) and fully electric vehicles (EVs). By combining a smaller battery with a gasoline engine, hybrids offer improved fuel efficiency and lower emissions without relying on extensive charging infrastructure, making them an accessible and efficient alternative in the transition toward electrification.

Toyota, one of the world’s largest automakers, has taken a more cautious approach to electrification. Last year, Akio Toyoda, Toyota’s Chairman, expressed doubts about the possibility of a complete transition to BEVs. He predicted that BEVs would likely reach a global ceiling of no more than 30% market share, citing infrastructure limitations, environmental concerns related to battery production, and the need for diversified powertrain solutions. Toyoda’s remarks sparked debate within the industry, as many automakers were doubling down on BEV production. However, Toyota’s recent announcement of a $912 million investment in hybrid vehicle production across its US manufacturing plants demonstrates the company’s commitment to a balanced and pragmatic electrification strategy.

Toyota’s pragmatic approach to electrification

Toyota’s decision to invest heavily in hybrid vehicle production reflects its belief in a multi-pathway strategy to meet the growing demand for electric vehicles (EVs). While many automakers are focusing exclusively on BEVs, Toyota is leveraging its expertise in hybrid technology to deliver scalable, practical solutions to reduce emissions. This approach aligns with Toyoda’s skepticism about the industry’s ability to overcome the challenges of mass BEV adoption.

Toyota Motor North America officially began production at its $13.9 billion battery manufacturing facility in Liberty, North Carolina, and this week announced a $912 million investment in hybrid production, underscoring its confidence in hybrids as a sustainable solution for the near term.

For example, Toyota’s West Virginia plant will receive $453 million to expand assembly of hybrid-compatible engines and transaxles, creating 80 new jobs. Similarly, the Kentucky plant, Toyota’s largest globally, will add an all-new machining line for hybrid-compatible engines with a $204.4 million investment and 82 new jobs. These investments highlight Toyota’s commitment to scaling hybrid technology to meet consumer demand while addressing BEV limitations.

Strategic diversification

Toyota’s multi-pathway strategy allows it to hedge against uncertainties in the BEV market. By investing in hybrids, plug-in hybrids, hydrogen fuel cells, and BEVs, Toyota ensures it remains competitive across a range of powertrain technologies. The company’s investment in hybrid production reflects its belief that electrification is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Different regions and consumers have varying needs, and hybrids offer a practical and affordable option for those who may not yet be ready to transition to fully EVs. Toyota’s casting plants in Tennessee and Missouri, which will receive $71.4 million and $57.1 million, respectively, are set to increase hybrid component production capacity, further reinforcing the company’s diversified approach.

Reinforcing leadership in hybrids

Toyota has long been a pioneer in hybrid technology, with the Prius among the most iconic hybrid vehicles globally. The company’s latest investments in hybrid production reaffirm its leadership in this space and its commitment to refining and scaling hybrid technology.

The addition of hybrid-electric Corollas to Toyota’s U.S. production lineup is a significant milestone. The Blue Springs, Mississippi plant will receive $125 million to assemble the first electrified Corollas in the U.S., marking a new chapter in Toyota’s hybrid journey. This move not only strengthens Toyota’s hybrid portfolio but also demonstrates its ability to adapt to evolving market demands.

The future of Toyota in the US

The investments in West Virginia, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Missouri showcase Toyota’s dedication to strengthening its US manufacturing footprint. By creating new jobs across five manufacturing plants, Toyota is driving economic growth and reinforcing its position as a key player in the US automotive industry.

Beyond manufacturing, Toyota is also investing in the workforce of the future through the Toyota USA Foundation's initiative, Driving Possibilities. The company’s $110 million initiative aims to close educational gaps through hands-on STEM learning and support for PreK-12 education. This program not only prepares the next generation of engineers and scientists but also underscores Toyota’s commitment to innovation and sustainability.

By doubling down on hybrids, Toyota is addressing immediate consumer demand for practical, scalable solutions while maintaining the flexibility to adapt to future advancements in electrified mobility. This investment in US automotive manufacturing also underscores Toyota’s dedication to creating new opportunities for American worker. Equally important is Toyota’s investment in the U.S. workforce of the future, helping to close educational gaps and foster innovation through STEM learning. As Toyota continues to expand its U.S. operations, its commitment to hybrid technology, job creation, and workforce development positions it as a leader in sustainable mobility and a key contributor to the nation’s economic growth.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltb299798942522069/blt9d1f20f1cd58baf6/691defca71c6a5c957cf5485/toyota-prius-2026.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-11-19 12:03:58.114731

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on Nov. 17, 2025, provided a pre-publication version of their proposed rule intended to provide greater regulatory certainty by clarifying the definition of ""waters of the United States"" (WOTUS).

The proposed rule aims to align with the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Sackett EPA, which narrowed the scope of federal jurisdiction.

This Holland & Knight alert provides a summary of how the rule would define WOTUS moving forward.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on Nov. 17, 2025, announced the release of a proposed rule revising the definition of ""waters of the United States"" (Proposed WOTUS Rule). The rule is intended to resolve the regulatory uncertainty that has persisted for decades regarding the scope of federal jurisdiction. (See Holland & Knight's previous alerts, ""Waters of the U.S. Rule Will Significantly Expand Federal Authority,"" Jan. 19, 2023, ""Sackett Decision Provides Clarity, Substantially Restricts Clean Water Act Jurisdiction Scope,"" May 26, 2023, and ""Waters of the United States Rule Revised in Response to Sackett Decision,"" Sept. 7, 2023.)

Among other things, the Proposed WOTUS Rule:

establishes that jurisdictional tributaries must connect to traditional navigable waters either directly or through other features (e.g., a culvert) that provide predictable and consistent flow

defines critical terms consistent with the Sackett decision, including definitions of ""relatively permanent"" and ""continuous surface connection"" with respect to adjacent wetlands

clarifies that ephemeral waters (i.e., those with surface water flowing or standing only in direct response to precipitation) are not jurisdictional because they are not relatively permanent

removes automatic jurisdiction for ""interstate waters""

adds and expands certain exclusions for prior converted cropland, ditches, wastewater treatment systems and groundwater

The Proposed WOTUS Rule aligns with the goals of the 2025 WOTUS Guidance and rulemaking announcement, aiming to provide consistency that is squarely in line with the U.S. Supreme Court's reasoning in Sackett v. EPA and borrows some exclusion concepts from the 2020 Navigable Waters Protection Rule (NWPR) promulgated during the first Trump Administration. Below summarizes the proposed amendments to the WOTUS definitions in 33 C.F.R. § 328.3 and 40 C.F.R. § 120.2.

New Proposed Definitions

The Proposed WOTUS Rule adds definitions for certain terms that are intended to guide application of the Sackett standard, including:

""Relatively permanent"" is proposed to be defined as ""standing or continuously flowing bodies of surface water that are standing or continuously flowing year-round or at least during the wet season."" The Proposed WOTUS Rule makes clear that ephemeral waters (i.e., those with surface water flowing or standing only in direct response to precipitation) are not jurisdictional because they are not relatively permanent. The agencies stated that the phrase ""at least during the wet season"" requires extended periods of predictable, continuous surface hydrology occurring in the same geographic feature year after year in response to the wet season, such as when average monthly precipitation exceeds average monthly evapotranspiration. The agencies are seeking comment on the most appropriate method to identify the wet season under the proposed definition of ""relatively permanent."" The proposed rule stresses the notion that such information should be readily available to ordinary citizens and trained professionals, such as through personal observations of field conditions. They indicate that they intend to use the metrics from the web-based Water-Budget Interactive Modeling Program (WebWIMP) as a primary source for identifying the wet season as opposed to brightline flow volumes or duration. There is an open question as to whether the flow would have to be during the entirety of the wet season or based on some proportion of that season, and they seek comment on that issue.

""Tributary"" is proposed to be defined as ""a body of water with relatively permanent flow, and a bed and bank, that connects to a downstream traditional navigable water or the territorial seas, either directly or through one or more waters or features that convey relatively permanent flow."" The Proposed WOTUS Rule clarifies that features without relatively permanent flow would sever jurisdiction. This definition is fairly consistent with existing practice, essentially treating natural, man-altered and manmade waterbodies as tributaries as long as the waters meet the ""relatively permanent"" standard set forth in Sackett. Tributaries under the proposed rule may also connect through certain features, both natural (e.g., debris piles, boulder fields or beaver dams) and artificial (e.g., culverts, ditches, pipes, tunnels, pumps, tide gates or dams), even if such features themselves are non-jurisdictional under the proposed rule, as long as those features convey relatively permanent flow. The proposed rule solicits comment on all aspects of the proposed definition of ""tributary"" and implementation of the definition, including whether to require ""bed and banks or additional physical characteristics"" in the definition. The agencies also request comment whether manmade features can connect tributaries downstream when they convey relatively permanent flow or if they should sever downstream jurisdiction in all cases other than as part of a water transfer. Under past attempts to address this issue a tributary does not lose its jurisdictional status if it contributes surface water flow to a downstream jurisdictional water through a channelized non-jurisdictional surface water feature such as a culvert, dam, tunnel or other similar artificial feature.

""Continuous surface connection,"" which is a prerequisite for adjacent wetlands to be considered WOTUS, is proposed to be defined as ""having surface water at least during the wet season and abutting (i.e., touching) a jurisdictional water,"" thereby creating a two-part test requiring both abutment of jurisdictional water and having surface water at least in the wet season. As described by the agencies, this proposed definition is intended to include wetlands that have ""at least semipermanent surface hydrology,"" which they believe satisfies the indistinguishability aspect of the Sackett decision, and excludes wetlands with only saturated soil fed by groundwater. Additionally, only the portion of the wetland that meets these two factors would be considered jurisdictional adjacent wetlands, regardless of the full scope of the wetland itself. The agencies also propose that culverts do not inherently sever the continuous surface connection when the culvert serves to extend the relatively permanent water. This would be demonstrated by relatively permanent water flow being present through the culvert, as well as an ordinary high watermark within the culvert, which provides the lateral limits of a tributary extending through the culvert. They are seeking comments on this approach, which would be likely very common such as when a stream passes under a roadway. The agencies seek comment on an alternative approach whereby wetlands, lakes and ponds would have a ""continuous surface connection"" only if they abut (i.e., touch) a jurisdictional water and have a perennial presence of surface water (i.e., it is year-round). Only wetlands that have permanent surface water, in addition to abutting a jurisdictional water, would be WOTUS under this alternative approach.

Proposed Changes to Exclusions

The Proposed WOTUS Rule proposes a new groundwater exclusion and revisions to certain existing exclusions, and adds corresponding definitions as follows:

Groundwater. The Proposed WOTUS Rule would add a new exclusion for groundwater, previously proposed in the 2020 NWPR, codifying the existing practice and historic understanding that groundwater is not WOTUS. The exclusion would expressly include groundwater drained through subsurface drainage systems.

Prior Converted Cropland. Under the existing 2023 WOTUS Rule, this existing exclusion expires upon a change in use of the land. The Proposed WOTUS Rule would clarify that the prior converted cropland exclusion would no longer apply when the cropland is abandoned for agricultural purposes for at least five years and the land has reverted to wetlands. The Proposed WOTUS Rule clarifies that the wetland is not automatically jurisdictional at that time; it would be jurisdictional only if it meets the requirements for an adjacent wetland. The Proposed WOTUS Rule also explains that ""agricultural purposes"" is broadly considered to include a variety of agricultural uses, including idling land for conservation uses and soil recovery.

Ditches. In an attempt to address confusion with respect to this existing exclusion, the Proposed WOTUS Rule proposes simply that all ditches, including roadside ditches, that are constructed or excavated entirely in dry land are not WOTUS, even if those ditches have relatively permanent flow and connect to jurisdictional waters. The only ""ditches"" that are intended to fall outside of this exclusion are tidal or navigable-in-fact ditches (i.e., canals).

Wastewater Treatment Systems. The agencies proposed to broaden this exclusion to include all components of a waste treatment system, which the agencies believe largely clarifies existing practice.

Proposed Removal of Interstate Waters and Intrastate Lakes and Ponds

The Proposed WOTUS Rule removes ""interstate waters"" from the WOTUS definition due to its overbreadth following Sackett. As explained by the agencies, ""interstate waters"" can be relatively permanent but do not have to be. Removal of ""interstate waters"" from the WOTUS definition removes an automatic jurisdictional determination with respect to such waters and instead requires them to be evaluated under the other jurisdictional categories and two-part test set forth in Sackett. The 2023 post-Sackett revisions to the 2023 WOTUS Rule already removed ""interstate wetlands"" from the WOTUS definition, meaning this proposed removal should not substantially affect the jurisdictional status of existing interstate wetlands.

For similar reasons, the agencies proposed to remove ""intrastate"" from the lakes and ponds category of the WOTUS definition to make clear that the ""relatively permanent"" standard applies regardless of whether the water is interstate or intrastate.

Impacts to Wetlands

Overall, with respect to wetlands, the Proposed WOTUS Rule reaffirms the existing law of the land set forth in Sackett that wetlands must be indistinguishable from jurisdictional waters through a continuous surface connection. The Regulatory Impact Analysis prepared by the agencies for the Proposed WOTUS Rule estimates that approximately 19 percent of wetlands listed on the National Wetlands Inventory would be considered WOTUS under the Proposed WOTUS Rule. In particular, the limitation of jurisdictional wetlands to those portions that have surface water at least during the wet season and abut a jurisdictional water are intended to further limit the scope of permafrost wetlands that are considered to have a continuous surface connection and aid the agencies in making jurisdictional determinations with respect to wetland mosaics.

The Proposed WOTUS Rule also provides implementation guidance for each of the above changes to clarify how these proposed changes would work in practice for field personnel.

Conclusion

This proposed rulemaking aims to solidify Sackett and provide clarity and durability to a longstanding debate. Only time will tell if the Proposed WOTUS Rule affords the finality that would benefit regulators and industry members alike.

The Trump administration’s war on clean energy has made it more difficult to build clean energy than some state-level policies once envisioned.
Democrats seem to believe the president’s war on clean energy has created a fresh rhetorical opening for them: They can now cast themselves as champions of cheap energy in all forms.
He said the Trump administration’s “assault” on clean energy made the pullback necessary.
Balik described the proposal as a “three-legged stool” of immediate rate relief, medium-term clean energy deployment, and long-term utility business model reform.","In state after state, governors and lawmakers are considering pulling back from their climate commitments — or have already reneged on them outright — out of a concern for the high costs that they could soon impose on voters. Democrats have justified the retreat by citing a new regime of sharper inflation, reduced federal support, and a need to deliver cheap energy of all kinds.

“We need to govern in reality,” New York Governor Kathy Hochul, for instance, said in a recent statement defending her approval of new natural gas infrastructure. “We are facing war against clean energy from Washington Republicans.”

Leaders in Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and California have all sounded similar notes while making or considering changes to their own states’ policies.

“The trend toward a different approach to energy policy that puts costs and pragmatism first is very real,” Josh Freed, the senior vice president for climate and energy programs at Third Way, a center-left think tank, told me.

“Affordability is the entry ticket for any other policy goal that politicians have,” he continued. “It particularly makes sense on climate and clean energy because we’ve all been talking for years about the need to electrify. If electricity is expensive, then electrification is simply not going to happen.”

The challenge is an old one for climate policy. Climate change — fueled by fossil fuel pollution — will ultimately raise costs through heat waves, extreme weather impacts, and a depleted natural world. But voters don’t go to the polls for lower costs in 2075. They want a cheaper cost of living now.

Democrats have more tools in this fight than ever before, with wind, solar, and batteries often much cheaper than other forms of generation. But to fully realize those cost savings — and to decarbonize the grid faster than utilities or power markets would otherwise go — politicians must push for politically or financially costly policies that speed up the transition, sometimes putting long-term climate goals ahead of near-term affordability concerns.

“We’ve been talking about affordability as the entry point and not the end of the story. It’s important to meet consumers and voters and elected officials where they are,” Justin Balik, the vice president for state policy at Evergreen Action, a climate-focused think tank and advocacy group, told me.

“We can make the argument — because the data is on our side — that clean energy is still cheaper and is a big part of lowering costs.”

Part of what’s driving this shift among Democrats on climate policy is economics. The Trump administration’s war on clean energy has made it more difficult to build clean energy than some state-level policies once envisioned. Many emissions reduction targets passed during the late 2010s or early 2020s — like New York’s, which requires the state to reduce emissions 40% from 1990 levels by 2030 and 85% by 2050 — assumed much faster clean electricity buildouts than have happened in practice. The president’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act will end wind and solar tax credits next year, driving up project costs in some cases by 40% more than once projected.

The president’s war on wind power, in particular, has hit particularly hard in Northeastern states, where grid managers once counted on thousands of megawatts of new offshore wind farms to supply power in the afternoon and evenings while meeting the states’ climate goals. The Trump administration has succeeded in cancelling virtually all of the Northeast’s offshore wind projects outside New York.

But economics do not explain all of the shifts. Democrats seem to believe the president’s war on clean energy has created a fresh rhetorical opening for them: They can now cast themselves as champions of cheap energy in all forms. Some have even revived the old Obama-era “all of the above” slogan for this new era.

“We have an energy crisis. Electricity prices for homeowners and businesses have gone up over 20% in New Jersey. The only answer is all of the above,” Representative Frank Pallone, the ranking member of the House energy committee, told Politico in September.

Even politicians who once championed climate change have downplayed it in recent speeches. New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, who once described himself as a “proud ecosocialist,” barely mentioned climate change during his general election campaign for mayor.

Hochul’s recent moves illustrate the shift. Over the past year, she has delayed implementing New York’s cap-and-invest law, which seeks to reduce statewide carbon emissions 40% by 2030. She also paused the state’s ban on gas stoves and furnaces in new homes and low-rise buildings, which is due to go into effect next year. (A state court has ordered her to implement the cap-and-invest law by February.)

This month, Hochul approved two new natural gas pipelines as part of a rumored deal with the Trump administration to salvage New York’s wind farms. She defended the decision by appealing to — you guessed it — affordability.

“We have adopted an all-of-the-above approach that includes a continued commitment to renewables and nuclear power to ensure grid reliability and affordability,” she said in a statement.

New York’s neighbors have gone down similar paths. In Pennsylvania, Governor Josh Shapiro struck a budget compromise with Republican lawmakers that will remove the state from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI, a compact of Northeastern states to cap carbon pollution from power plants and invest the resulting revenue.

Shapiro blamed Republicans, who he said have “used RGGI as an excuse to stall substantive conversations about energy,” but said he was focused on — yes, again— “cutting costs.”

“I’m going to be aggressive about pushing for policies that create more jobs in the energy sector, bring more clean energy onto the grid, and reduce the cost of energy for Pennsylvanians,” he said before signing the budget deal.

California has also reworked its own climate policy in response to cost-of-living concerns. Earlier this year, it passed an energy package that re-upped its cap-and-trade program while allowing new oil extraction in south-central Kern County. The legislation was partly driven by a fear that local refineries would shutter — and gas prices could soar — without more crude production.

Massachusetts could soon join the pullback. Earlier this month, the state’s House of Representatives fast-tracked a bill that included a provision nullifying a legal mandate to cut carbon emissions in half by 2030, as compared to 1990 levels.

While the bill preserved the state’s longer-term goal to cut emissions by 80% by 2050, it rendered the 2030 mandate “advisory in nature and unenforceable.”

“The number one goal is to save money and adjust to the reality with clean energy,” Representative Mark Cusack, co-chair of the energy and utilities committee and the bill’s sponsor, told the local Commonwealth Beacon. He said the Trump administration’s “assault” on clean energy made the pullback necessary. “We want to get there, but if we’re going to miss our mandates and it’s not the fault of ours, it’s incumbent on us not to get sued and not have the ratepayers be on the hook,” he said.

Cusack’s bill also included measures to transform the state’s Mass Save program — which helps households and businesses to switch to electrified heating and appliances — by dropping the program’s climate mandate and its ban on buying efficient natural gas appliances.

On Monday, lawmakers removed the mandate provision from the bill but preserved its other reforms. While the bill is no longer fast tracked, they could choose to revisit the legislation as soon as next year.

New Jersey may also revisit its own climate commitments. Governor-elect Mikie Sherrill swept to victory this month in part by promising to freeze state utility rates. She could do that in part by lifting or suspending certain “social benefit charges” now placed on state power bills.

In the long term, though, Sherrill will have to pursue other policies to lower rates. Researchers at Evergreen Action and the National Resources Defense Council have argued that changing the state’s electricity policies could lower carbon emissions while saving ratepayers more than $400 a year by 2030.

Balik described the proposal as a “three-legged stool” of immediate rate relief, medium-term clean energy deployment, and long-term utility business model reform. He also mourned that other states have not used revenue from their climate programs to pay for climate programs.

“There’s a danger of looking at cost concerns a little myopically,” he said. “Cap and invest [in New York] was paused for the stated reason that it’s not helpful with cost, but you could use cap-and-invest revenues to pay for things on the rate base now.”

THE TOP FIVE

1. FEMA head is out

David Richardson, the acting head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, resigned Monday after just six months on the job. Richardson had no experience in managing natural disasters, and Axios reported, he “faced sharp criticism for being unavailable” amid the extreme floods that left 130 dead in Central Texas in July. A month earlier, Richardson raised eyebrows when he held a meeting in which he told staff he was unaware the U.S. had a hurricane season. He was, however, a “loyalist” to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, CNN reported.

With hurricane season wrapping up this month, President Donald Trump was preparing to fire Richardson in the lead up to an overhaul of the agency, whose resources for carrying out disaster relief he wants to divvy up among the states. When FEMA staffers criticized the move in an open letter over the summer, the agency suspended 40 employees who signed with their names, as I wrote in the newsletter at the time.

2. EPA slashes wetland protections

The Environmental Protection Agency proposed stripping federal protections from millions of acres of wetlands and streams. The New York Times cast the stakes of the rollback as “potentially threatening sources of clean drinking water for millions of Americans” while delivering “a victory for a range of business interests that have lobbied to scale back the Clean Water Act of 1972, including farmers, home builders, real estate developers, oil drillers and petrochemical manufacturers.” At an event announcing the rulemaking, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin recognized that the proposal “is going to be met with a lot of relief from farmers, ranchers, and other landowners and governments.” Under the Clean Water Act, companies and individuals need to obtain permits from the EPA before releasing pollutants into the nation’s waterways, and permits from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers before discharging any dredged or fill material such as sand, silt, or construction debris. Yet just eliminating the federal oversight doesn’t necessarily free developers and farmers of permitting challenges since that jurisdiction simply goes to the state.

3. Power outages are getting longer across the U.S.

A chart from the report shows how much worse this year is than previous ones.J.D. Power

Americans are spending greater lengths of time in the dark amid mounting power outages, according to a new survey by the data analytics giant J.D. Power. The report, released last month but highlighted Monday in Utility Dive, cited “increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events” as the cause. The average length of the longest blackout of the year increased in all regions since 2022, from 8.1 hours to 12.8 by the midpoint of 2025. Ratepayers in the South reported the longest outages, averaging 18.2 hours, followed by the West, at 12.4 hours. While the duration of outages is worsening, the number of Americans experiencing them isn’t, J.D. Power’s director of utilities intelligence, Mark Spalinger, told Utility Dive. The percentage of ratepayers experiencing “perfect power” without any interruptions is gradually rising, he said, but disasters like storms and fires “are becoming so much more extreme that it creates these longer outage events that utilities are now having to deal with.”

The problem is particularly bad in the summertime. As Heatmap’s Matthew Zeitlin explained back in June, “the demands on the grid are growing at the same time the resources powering it are changing. Between broad-based electrification, manufacturing additions, and especially data center construction, electricity load growth is forecast to grow several percent a year through at least the end of the decade. At the same time, aging plants reliant on oil, gas, and coal are being retired (although planned retirements are slowing down), while new resources, largely solar and batteries, are often stuck in long interconnection queues — and, when they do come online, offer unique challenges to grid operators when demand is high.”

4. A solar manufacturer says it’s opening another factory thanks to Trump

You win some, you lose some. Earlier this month, solar developer Pine Gate Renewables blamed the Trump administration’s policies in its bankruptcy filing. Now a major solar manufacturer is crediting its expansion plans to the president. Arizona-based First Solar said last week it plans to open a new panel factory in South Carolina. The $330 million factory will create 600 new jobs, E&E News reported, if it comes online in the second half of next year as planned. First Solar said the investment is the result of Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. “The passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the Administration’s trade policies boosted demand for American energy technology, requiring a timely, agile response that allows us to meet the moment,” First Solar CEO Mark Widmar said in a statement. “We expect that this new facility will enable us to serve the U.S. market with technology that is compliant with the Act’s stringent provisions, within timelines that align with our customers’ objectives.”

If you want to review what actually goes into making a solar panel, it’s worth checking out Matthew’s explainer from the Climate 101 series.

5. France’s oil giant is making a big bet on electricity

French oil and gas giant TotalEnergies said Monday it would make a $6 billion investment into power plants across Europe, expanding what The Wall Street Journal called “a strategy that has set it apart from rivals focused on pumping more fossil fuels.” To start, the company agreed to buy 50% of a portfolio of assets owned by Energeticky a Prumyslovy Holding, the investment fund controlled by the Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky. While few question the rising value of power generation amid a surge in electricity demand from the data centers supporting artificial intelligence software, analysts and investors “question whether investment in power generation — particularly renewables — will be as lucrative as oil and gas.” Rivals Shell and BP, for example, recently axed their renewables businesses to double down on fossil fuels.

THE KICKER

The world has successfully stored as much carbon dioxide as 81,044,946 gasoline-powered cars would emit in a year. The first-ever audit of all major carbon storage projects in the U.S., China, Brazil, Australia, and the Middle East found over 383 million tons of carbon dioxide stored since 1996. “The central message from our report is that CCS works, demonstrating a proven capability and accelerating momentum for geologic storage of CO2,” Samuel Krevor, a professor of subsurface carbon storage at Imperial College London’s Department of Earth Science and Engineering, said in a press release.

What will most likely happen, Abraham Silverman, a Johns Hopkins University scholar who previously served as the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities’ general counsel, told me, is that New Jersey’s four major electric utilities will work with the governor to deliver on her promise, finding ways to shave off spending and show some forbearance.

Indeed, “We stand ready to work with the incoming administration to do our part to keep rates as low as possible in the short term and work on longer-term solutions to add supply,” Ralph LaRossa, the chief executive of PSE&G, one of the major utilities in New Jersey, told analysts on an earnings call held the day before the election.

PSE&G’s retail bills rose 36% this past summer, according to the investment bank Jefferies. As for what working with the administration might look like, “We expect management to offer rate concessions,” Jefferies analyst Paul Zimbrado wrote in a note to clients in the days following the election, meaning essentially that the utility would choose to eat some higher costs. PSE&G might also get “creative,” which could mean things like “extensions of asset recoverable lives, regulatory item amortization acceleration, and other approaches to deliver customer bill savings in the near-term,” i.e. deferring or spreading out costs to minimize their immediate impact. “These would be cash flow negative but [PSE&G] has the cushion to absorb it,” Zimbrado wrote.

In return, Silverman told me that the New Jersey utilities “have a wish list of things they want from the administration and from the legislature,” including new nuclear plants, owning generation, and investing in energy storage. “I think that they are probably incented to work with the new administration to come up with that list of items that they think they can accomplish again without sacrificing reliability.”

Well before the election, in a statement issued in August responding to Sherrill’s energy platform, PSE&G hinted toward a path forward in its dealings with the state, noting that it isn’t allowed to build or own power generation and arguing that this deregulatory step “precluded all New Jersey electric companies from developing or offering new sources of power supply to meet rising demand and reduce prices.” Of course, the failure to get new supply online has bedeviled regulators and policymakers throughout the PJM Interconnection, of which New Jersey is a part. If Mikie Sherrill can figure out how to get generation online quickly in New Jersey, she’ll have accomplished something more impressive than a rate freeze.

As for ways to accomplish the governor-elect’s explicit goal of keeping price increases at zero, Silverman suggested that large-scale investments could be paid off on a longer timeline, which would reduce returns for utilities. Other investments could be deferred for at least a few years in order to push out beyond the current “bubble” of high costs due to inflation. That wouldn’t solve the problem forever, though, Silverman told me. It could simply mean “seeing lower costs today, but higher costs in the future,” he said.

New Jersey will also likely have to play a role in deliberations happening in front of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission about interconnecting large loads — i.e. data centers — a major driver of costs throughout PJM and within New Jersey specifically. Rules that force data centers to “pay their own way” for transmission costs associated with getting on the grid could relieve some of the New Jersey price crunch, Silverman told me. “I think that will be a really significant piece.”

Then there’s the hard way — slashing utilities’ regulated rates of return.

In a report prepared for the Natural Resources Defence Council and Evergreen Collective and released after the election, Synapse Economics considered reducing utilities’ regulated return on equity, the income they’re allowed to generate on their investments in the grid, from its current level of 9.6% as one of four major levers to bring down prices. A two percentage point reduction in the return on equity, the group found, would reduce annual bills by $40 in 2026.

Going after the return on equity would be a more difficult, more contentious path than working cooperatively on deferring costs and increasing generation, Silverman told me. If voluntary and cooperative solutions aren’t enough to stop rate increases, however, Sherrill might choose to take it anyway. “You could come in and immediately cut that rate of return, and that would absolutely put downward pressure on rates in the short run. But you establish a very contentious relationship with the utilities,” Silverman told me.

Silverman pointed to Connecticut, where regulators and utilities developed a hostile relationship in recent years, resulting in the state’s Public Utilities Regulatory Authority chair, Marissa Gillett, stepping down last month. Gillett had served on PURA since 2019, and had tried to adopt “performance-based ratemaking,” where utility payouts wouldn’t be solely determined by their investment level, but also by trying to meet public policy goals like energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Connecticut utilities said these rules would make attracting capital to invest in the grid more difficult. Gillett’s tenure was also marred by lawsuits from the state’s utilities over accusations of “bias” against them in the ratemaking process. At the same time, environmental and consumer groups hailed her approach.

While Sherrill and her energy officials may not want to completely overhaul how they approach ratemaking, some conflict with the state’s utilities may be necessary to deliver on her signature campaign promise.

Going directly after the utilities’ regulated return “is kind of like making your kid eat their broccoli,” Silverman said. “You can probably make them eat it. You can have a very contentious evening for the rest of the night.”",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MjIwNjk5NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTgyMDk3MjU4MH0.VA5lLGANmfvrkU2pFa7YBxm6cdPSKQ226GYzylRh7j0/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-11-19 12:04:08.488627

E-1 – System Energy Resources (Docket No. ER25-2258-001). On May 19, 2025, System Energy Resources (SERI) filed proposed amendments to the effective Unit Power Sales Agreement (UPSA) on file with the Commission. SERI owns or leases 90 percent of Grand Gulf Nuclear Station, a generating facility located in Mississippi, and makes capacity and energy sales to four of its affiliated public utilities as part of Entergy Services, LLC. Namely, SERI sought to revise entitlement percentages under the wholesale rate schedule, pursuant to a settlement approved by the Commission in November 2024, for Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Arkansas, and Entergy Louisiana. Additionally, Entergy Louisiana would be removed as a party to the UPSA (and its entitlement reduced to zero percent). On June 9, 2025, the Arkansas Public Service Commission (APSC) submitted a protest, contending that SERI did not sufficiently demonstrate that the proposed revised UPSA entitlement percentages would be just and reasonable in accordance with Section 205 of the Federal Power Act (FPA) and that SERI did not show that the proposed revisions would be consistent with the public interest. On June 9, 2025, the Louisiana Public Service Commission (LPSC) filed comments in support of the proposed revisions to entitlement percentages. On July 31, 2025, the Commission issued an order accepting the revised UPSA, finding that the revised entitlement percentages based on their life-of-unit purchases are just and reasonable. On September 2, 2025, APSC filed a request for rehearing of the July 31 order. Agenda item E-1 may be an order on the rehearing request.

E-2 – System Energy Resources (Docket No. ER22-24-002). On October 1, 2021, SERI filed proposed changes to the effective UPSA, pursuant to Section 205 of the FPA, in order to allow for the inclusion of prepaid and accrued pension costs in rate base associated with its qualified pension plans. In the filing, SERI stated that the inputs for the proposed pension changes originate from the qualified pension plan data contained in its annual FERC Form 1 filings as supplemented by certain accounting records. On October 22, 2021 and November 2, 2021, respectively, LPSC submitted a protest and supplemental protest, asserting that the actuarial approach proposed by SERI in order to calculate the ""prepaid"" pension expense is faulty and that SERI relied on misleading representations in its proposal. LPSC also stated that SERI did not furnish the appropriate data that would aid the Commission in evaluating the prepaid or accrued pension costs. On November 23, 2021, SERI filed an answer to the LPSC protests, stating that LPSC offered factually incorrect or irrelevant assertions to the calculation of prepaid pension costs. On March 15, 2022, the Commission issued an order accepting and suspending for a period the proposed revisions, subject to refund, and establishing settlement judge procedures. Over the ensuing months, an administrative law judge (ALJ) presided over seven settlement proceedings among the parties. On August 7, 2023, the chief judge issued an order terminating the settlement proceedings, and designated a presiding judge to preside over a final hearing and subsequently issue an Initial Decision on the outstanding material issues. On September 6, 2023, a prehearing conference between the parties was held. On October 16, 2023, SERI filed a partial settlement to resolve whether it had properly classified accumulated deferred income tax in the calculation of prepaid pension cost under the Commission's Uniform System of Accounts. The Commission approved the partial settlement as uncontested on January 18, 2024. On May 21, 2024, the parties commenced the hearing, which concluded on May 31, 2024. A post-hearing conference was subsequently held on June 12, 2024. On September 6, 2024, the chief judge issued the Initial Decision, finding that the ""preponderance of substantial evidence"" in the hearing record supported the proposition that the Commission should approve the proposed FPA Section 205 amendment to the UPSA and its embedded formula rate to include a line item for prepaid (i.e., accrued) pension cost in rate base. On October 7, 2024, the parties submitted respective Briefs on Exceptions with respect to the Initial Decision; on October 28, 2024, the parties submitted respective Briefs Opposing Exceptions. Agenda item E-2 may be an order on the Initial Decision and outstanding material issues.

E-3 – Pacific Gas and Electric Company (Docket No. ER24-3032-000). On September 13, 2024, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) submitted a compliance filing, pursuant to Order No. 2023 and Order No. 2023-A, with respect to proposed amendments to its Wholesale Distribution Tariff (WDT). The PG&E WDT describes the terms under which PG&E provides open access to its distribution system to wholesale customers seeking to interconnect wholesale generation facilities. Order No. 2023, issued by the Commission on July 28, 2023, reformed the generator interconnection study processes of public utility transmission providers operating under effective OATTs. Primarily, Order No. 2023 required that transmission providers employ a first-ready, first-served cluster study process for large generating facilities exceeding 20 MW. Order No. 2023-A, issued on March 21, 2024, extended the compliance deadline to May 16, 2024. The Commission did not find that Order No. 2023 fully applied to WDTs but nonetheless directed PG&E and distribution system providers to ""address its concerns and applicability in its individual compliance filing,"" due within 90 calendar days of the Order No. 2023 compliance filings of the relevant Regional Transmission Organization or Independent System Operator. In the compliance filing, PG&E stated that it has already incorporated many of the reforms set forth in Order No. 2023. Although it does not align precisely with all of the reforms proposed by the California Independent System Operator Corporation (CAISO), PG&E stated that it generally fashioned its compliance filing based on the form and structure of the CAISO Order No. 2023 compliance filing submitted on May 16, 2024. On October 4, 2024, California Energy Storage Alliance (CESA) filed a protest, contending that the PG&E compliance filing fails to provide interconnection customers with electric storage resources the ability to design and charge their facilities in a manner that would satisfy the proposed operating parameters. On October 15, 2024, PG&E filed an answer to the protest, stating that Order No. 2023 did not require utilities to use the proposed operating parameters or assumptions of an interconnection customer. Agenda item E-3 may be an order on the PG&E compliance filing.

E-4 – San Diego Gas & Electric Company (Docket No. ER10-1391-003). On August 28, 2024, San Diego Gas & Electric Company (SDG&E) submitted a compliance filing, pursuant to Order No. 2023 and Order No. 2023-A, with respect to proposed amendments to its Wholesale Distribution Access Tariff (WDAT). The SDG&E WDAT describes the terms under which SDG&E provides open access to its distribution system to wholesale customers seeking to interconnect wholesale generation facilities. Order No. 2023, issued by the Commission on July 28, 2023, reformed the generator interconnection study processes of public utility transmission providers operating under effective OATTs. Primarily, Order No. 2023 required that transmission providers employ a first-ready, first-served cluster study process for large generating facilities exceeding 20 MW. Order No. 2023-A, issued on March 21, 2024, extended the compliance deadline to May 16, 2024. The Commission did not find that Order No. 2023 fully applied to WDATs but nonetheless directed SDG&E and distribution system providers to ""address its concerns and applicability in its individual compliance filing,"" due within 90 calendar days of the Order No. 2023 compliance filings of the relevant Regional Transmission Organization or Independent System Operator. Although it does not align precisely with all of the reforms proposed CAISO, SDG&E stated that it generally fashioned its compliance filing based on the form and structure of the CAISO Order No. 2023 compliance filing submitted on May 16, 2024. On September 18, 2024, CESA, Clean Energy Alliance and Community Power, and the Clean Coalition, respectively, filed protests of the SDG&E compliance filing, generally alleging that the proposed elimination of its Independent Study Process (ISP) for small generators would impede the ability of small generators to interconnect to SDG&E in a timely and efficient manner. Further, the protests echoed the concerns raised by CESA in the PG&E Order No. 2023 compliance proceeding discussed in agenda item E-3, namely that the operating assumptions for electric storage resources would fail to permit the control technologies that ensure operation within ""agreed-upon parameters."" On November 4, 2024, SDG&E submitted an answer to the respective protests, stating that it does not expressly prohibit certain practices (i.e., by removing the ISP but preserving the Fast Track serial screening process) in order to strike a balance ""between preserving the interests of small and large generator interconnection customers."" On August 1, 2025, San Diego Community Power, et al. submitted a motion for expedited consideration. Agenda item E-4 may be an order on the SDG&E compliance filing.

E-5 – Southern California Edison Company (Docket Nos. ER24-2776-000, ER24-2776-001). On August 14, 2024, Southern California Edison Company (SCE) submitted a compliance filing, pursuant to Order No. 2023 and Order No. 2023-A, with respect to proposed amendments to its WDAT. The SCE WDAT describes the terms under which SCE provides open access to its distribution system to wholesale customers seeking to interconnect wholesale generation facilities. Order No. 2023, issued by the Commission on July 28, 2023, reformed the generator interconnection study processes of public utility transmission providers operating under effective OATTs. Primarily, Order No. 2023 required that transmission providers employ a first-ready, first-served cluster study process for large generating facilities exceeding 20 MW. Order No. 2023-A, issued on March 21, 2024, extended the compliance deadline to May 16, 2024. The Commission did not find that Order No. 2023 fully applied to WDATs but nonetheless directed SCE and distribution system providers to ""address its concerns and applicability in its individual compliance filing,"" due within 90 calendar days of the Order No. 2023 compliance filings of the relevant Regional Transmission Organization or Independent System Operator. Although it does not align precisely with all of the reforms proposed CAISO, SCE stated that it generally fashioned its compliance filing based on the form and structure of the CAISO Order No. 2023 compliance filing submitted on May 16, 2024. On September 4, 2024, Terra-Gen, LLC filed a protest, asserting that certain proposed deviations from pro forma provisions (namely, by failing to include the option for interconnection customers to provide operation assumptions) are neither consistent or superior to Commission requirements. On September 20, 2024, SCE filed an answer to the protest, stating that Order No. 2023 did not address operating assumptions for transmission or distribution service, and the assertion that SCE should be compelled to include at least one electric storage operating assumption would be assessed as part of the distribution service request, not interconnection service. Agenda item E-5 may be an order on the SCE compliance filing.

E-6 – EDF power solutions Development, Inc. (Docket No. EL25-111-000). On August 7, 2025, EDF power solutions Development, Inc. (EDF), on behalf of its subsidiary Rainbow Valley Energy Center, LLC, filed a petition for declaratory order, pursuant to Rule 207 of the Rules of Practice and Procedure of the Commission. EDF stated that, on November 7, 2023, Salt River Project Agricultural Improvement and Power District (SRP) submitted its new Large Generator Interconnection Process (LGIP) following the issuance of Order No. 2023. According to EDF, SRP failed to implement Order No. 2023 with respect to the affected system study process, which resulted in SRP removing Rainbow Valley from the interconnection queue. EDF stated that, ""through no fault of Rainbow Valey and because of causes beyond its control,"" it had problems receiving certain affected system studies on a timely basis. On July 16, 2025, EDF sent a letter to SRP invoking dispute resolution processes and asserting force majeure under the SRP LGIP. On July 17, 2025, SRP notified EDF that it had withdrawn Rainbow Valley from the interconnection queue. On September 8, 2025, SRP filed a protest, stating that it had withdrawn its Safe Harbor status years prior, although it continues to provide reciprocal service to other transmission facilities. As such, SRP contends that because EDF itself does not offer transmission service by which SRP could reciprocate, the request is moot. On September 8, 2025, the American Public Power Association, Large Public Power Council, and National Rural Electric Cooperative Association also filed a protest, stating that the requested relief would contravene Commission precedent and that the Commission lacks statutory authority to issue such an order declaring that SRP's reciprocity tariff is no longer valid, as EDF sought. Agenda item E-6 may be an order on the petition.

Miscellaneous

M-1 – Duty of Candor (Docket No. RM22-20-000). On July 28, 2022, the Commission issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR), pursuant to Sections 206, 215, 307, and 309 of the Federal Power Act (FPA), Sections 5, 14, and 16 of the Natural Gas Act (NGA), Sections 1(5)(a), 12(1)(a), 13, and 15 of the Interstate Commerce Act (ICA), Sections 311(c) and 501(a) of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA), and Sections 402(a)(2) and 402(h) of the Department of Energy Organization Act. In the NOPR, the Commission proposed to add a new section to 18 CFR part 1 to require that any entity communicating with the Commission or other specified organizations submit accurate and factual information, and to not submit false or misleading information, or to omit material information. The Commission stated that a ""broadly applicable duty of candor"" will improve its ability to effectively conduct oversight on the jurisdictional markets under its authority. A large number of stakeholders and interested parties submitted comments, including joint comments by certain RTOs including ISO New England (ISO-NE), Midcontinent System Operator, Inc. (MISO), PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. (PJM), and Southwest Power Pool, Inc. (SPP) on November 10, 2022. The joint RTO comments generally expressed support for the NOPR, stating that ""it is important for the duty of candor to apply broadly to all information related to the administration of the RTO markets (including matters such as organizational structure, membership and credit matters)."" Other comments, such as those filed by the American Public Power Association on November 10, 2022, expressed concern with respect to the ""exceptionally broad"" scope of the NOPR, and was particularly concerned as it would relate to communications with entities other than the Commission and its staff (i.e., if the NOPR were to apply to all communications with RTOs, ISOs, market monitors, the Electric Reliability Organization and its regional entities, and so forth). Agenda item M-1 may be an order furnishing a Final Rule on duty of candor.

M-2 – Waiver of Tariff Requirements (Docket No. PL20-7-000). On May 21, 2020, the Commission issued a Proposed Policy Statement to clarify requests for waiver of tariff provisions. The Commission stated that reviewing courts had instructed that ""[t]he filed rate doctrine and the rule against retroactive ratemaking leave the Commission no discretion to waive the operation of a filed rate or to retroactively change or adjust a rate for good cause or for any other equitable considerations."" Accordingly, the Commission determined that, under some circumstances, it has issued tariff waiver orders beyond the limits imposed by the filed rate doctrine. Under both Section 206 of the FPA and Section 5 of the NGA, the Commission is not permitted to allow retroactive changes to filed rates. A number of stakeholders and interested parties filed comments, generally offering feedback on exceptions to waivers of the prior notice requirement and other circumstances that do not violate the filed rate doctrine but continue to provide for some manner of flexibility. Agenda item M-2 may be an order on the Proposed Policy Statement.

Gas

G-1 – Supplemental Review of the Oil Pipeline Index Level (Docket No. RM25-2-000). On October 17, 2024, the Commission issued a Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Supplemental NOPR) proposing to amend the index level used to determine annual charges to oil pipeline rate ceilings in light of the decision issued in Liquid Energy Pipeline Association v. FERC by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The Commission proposed to use the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods (PPI-FG) minus 0.21 percent as the prospective index level for the remainder of the five-year period that began on July 1, 2021. A number of stakeholders and interested parties filed initial comments, with some concerns expressed about the frequency of the review (i.e., deviating from prior Commission policy to revise the Five-Year Index within four years). Certain parties raised the prospect of a destabilizing effect on regulated pipelines due to the potential implementation of new rates outside of the typical timeframe. On December 20, 2024, respectively, some parties filed reply comments, stating that the Supplemental NOPR would appropriately reinstate the oil pipeline index of PPI-FG minus 0.28 percent. Agenda item G-1 may be an order on the Supplemental NOPR.

G-2 – Revisions to Oil Pipeline Regulations Pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Docket No. RM93-11-003); Five-Year Review of the Oil Pipeline Index (Docket Nos. RM20-14-003, RM20-14-004). On September 17, 2024, the Commission issued an order reinstating the oil pipeline index level of Producer Price Index for Finished Goods plus 0.78 percent, in accordance with the directive of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in Liquid Energy Pipeline Association v. FERC. The reinstated oil pipeline index level would revert to the order issued by the Commission on December 17, 2020. On October 3, 2024, the Liquids Shippers Group filed a request for clarification, or, in the alternative, rehearing of the September 17 order. In the request, the Liquids Shippers Group sought clarification that any filings made by pipelines to increase their ceiling levels and/or indexed rates pursuant to the order would be made effective subject to refund and any subsequent action taken by the Commission, in the event that the Commission modifies the index level downward in the future. Agenda item G-2 may be an order on the request for clarification or rehearing.

G-3 – Airlines for America and National Propane Gas Association (Docket No. RM18-10-000). On February 1, 2017, Airlines for America and National Propane Gas Association (collectively, Petitioners) submitted a petition for rulemaking in order to apply its existing affiliate Standards of Conduct for Transmission Providers regulations to crude oil, natural gas liquids (NGLs), and petroleum product pipelines, pursuant to Sections 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12, and 15 of the Interstate Commerce Act (ICA). Petitioners stated that a lack of Commission regulations with respect to the marketing of certain commodities on interstate transmission pipelines led to ""slower and more cautious decision making by non-affiliated shippers."" Petitioners also stated that, unlike the electric power and natural gas sectors under Commission jurisdiction, the use of transmission function information by marketing affiliates of oil pipelines is not controlled or monitored by its regulations. Accordingly, Petitioners asked that the Commission assert its legal authority under the ICA to expand such regulations to crude oil, NGL, and petroleum product pipelines. A number of stakeholders and interested parties filed comments and protests, generally opposing the petition. The protests contended that Petitioners sought to impose new regulatory programs without sufficient justification, and that such potential requirements would lead to a significant administrative burden and increase in costs. Other protests stated that Petitioners falsely claimed that a large number of oil pipelines function as ""natural monopolies"" and therefore their regulatory treatment should be tantamount to the electric power and natural gas sectors. Agenda item G-3 may be an order on the petition.

G-4 – Safe Harbor Policy for Data Providers to Price Index Developers (Docket No. RM20-7-000). On December 17, 2020, the Commission issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) with respect to amending its regulations in order to codify the Safe Harbor Policy established in its Policy Statement on Natural Gas and Electric Price Indices. In the NOPR, the Commission stated that, under the Safe Harbor Policy, data providers that report transactions to natural gas and electric price index developers are afforded a rebuttable presumption that their transaction data is accurate, timely, and submitted in good faith. Accordingly, the NOPR would ""promote voluntary reporting"" of such transactions and alleviate market participant concerns that the Safe Harbor Policy is not binding. A number of stakeholders filed comments generally supporting the language outlined in the NOPR. Agenda item G-4 may be an order on the NOPR.

C-2 – Northwest Pipeline LLC (Docket No. CP25-89-000); Portland General Electric Company, B-R Pipeline, LLC and KB Pipeline Company (Docket No. CP25-90-000). On February 27, 2025, Northwest Pipeline LLC (Northwest) submitted an abbreviated application, pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act (NGA), for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCN) authorizing it to acquire, own, operate, and maintain the existing Kelso-Beaver Pipeline. According to Northwest, the acquisition will become a lateral extension of its existing interstate natural gas transmission system. Northwest also sought authorization to expand the existing pipeline into a bi-directional pipeline, upon acquisition, and to construct a new compressor station. A number of stakeholders filed comments in support of the abbreviated application. On April 28, 2025, the Commission issued a letter requesting additional information from Northwest. On May 5, 2025, Northwest filed a response to the deficiency letter. On May 5, 2025, the Commission issued a letter requesting additional information from Northwest in order to assist in the environmental analysis for the project. On May 23, 2025, Northwest filed a response to the environmental data request. On August 22, 2025, the Commission issued the Environmental Assessment, finding that approval of the proposed project would not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. Agenda item C-2 may be an order on the CPCN application.

C-3 – Distrigas of Massachusetts LLC (Docket No. CP25-207-000). On April 14, 2025, Distrigas of Massachusetts LLC (DOMAC) submitted an application, pursuant to Section 3 of the NGA, for authorization of a limited amendment to modify its existing facilities. In the application, DOMAC stated that it intended to incorporate new equipment and control instruments that will allow it to install a redundant boil-off gas compressor to capture boil-off gas emissions from its liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage system. On May 8, 2025, the Commission issued a letter requesting additional information from DOMAC in order to assist in the environmental analysis for the project. On May 19, 2025, DOMAC filed a response to the environmental data request. On June 27, 2025, the Commission issued the Environmental Assessment, finding that approval of the proposed project would not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. Agenda item C-3 may be an order on the limited amendment.

C-4 – Eastern Gas Transmission and Storage, Inc. (Docket No. CP25-29-000). On December 11, 2024, Eastern Gas Transmission and Storage, Inc. (EGTS) submitted an abbreviated application, pursuant to Section 7(c) of the NGA, for a CPCN authorizing it to construct, install, own, operate, and maintain certain interstate natural gas pipeline facilities. According to EGTS, the proposed facilities would comprise the Capital Project, which would provide firm natural gas transportation service to one fully subscribed, non-affiliated customer. A number of parties and stakeholders, including elected officials and trade groups, filed comments generally in support of the project. On January 16, 2025, the Commission issued a letter requesting additional information from EGTS in order to assist in the environmental analysis for the project. On January 22, 2025, EGTS filed a response to the environmental data request. The Commission issued subsequent environmental data requests on February 19, 2025 and May 5, 2025, respectively; EGTS filed responses to those requests on March 7, 2025 and May 12, 2025. On July 30, 2025, EGTS submitted the State Water Quality Certification, pursuant to Section 401 of the Clean Water Act, issued by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection on July 23, 2025. On August 8, 2025, the Commission issued the Environmental Assessment, finding that approval of the proposed project would not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.

It was under this scenario that Bressler estimated that, by 2100, climate change will have caused 83 million people to die of temperature-related deaths around the world.","New advances in environmental science are providing a detailed understanding of the human costs of the Trump administration’s approach to climate change.

Increasing temperatures are already killing enormous numbers of people. A ProPublica and Guardian analysis that draws on sophisticated modeling by independent researchers found that President Donald Trump’s “America First” agenda of expanding fossil fuels and decimating efforts to reduce emissions will add substantially to that toll, with the vast majority of deaths occurring outside the United States.

Most of the people expected to die from soaring temperatures in the coming decades live in poor, hot countries in Africa and South Asia, according to recent research. Many of these countries emitted relatively little of the pollution that causes climate change — and are least prepared to cope with the increasing heat.

ProPublica and the Guardian’s analysis shows that extra greenhouse gases released in the next decade as a result of Trump’s policies are expected to lead to as many as 1.3 million more temperature-related deaths worldwide in the 80 years after 2035. The actual number of people who die from heat will be much higher, but a warming planet will also result in fewer deaths from cold.

Leaders from most of the world’s countries are now gathered at an international conference in Belém, Brazil, to address the escalating effects of climate change. The absence of the United States, which has 4% of the world’s population but has produced 20% of its greenhouse gases, has been pointedly noted by participants. Afghanistan, Myanmar and San Marino are the only other nations that did not send a delegation to the meeting, according to a provisional list of participants.

Our calculations use modeled estimates of the additional emissions that will be released as a result of Trump’s policies as well as a peer-reviewed metric for what is known as the mortality cost of carbon. That metric, which builds on Nobel Prize-winning science that has informed federal policy for more than a decade, predicts the number of temperature-related deaths from additional emissions. The estimate reflects deaths from heat-related causes, such as heat stroke and the exacerbation of existing illnesses, minus lives saved by reduced exposure to cold. It does not include the massive number of deaths expected from the broader effects of climate change, such as droughts, floods, wars, vector-borne diseases, hurricanes, wildfires and reduced crop yields.

The numbers, while large, are just a fraction of the estimated 83 million temperature-related deaths that could result from all human-caused emissions over the same period if climate-warming pollution is not curtailed. But they speak to the human cost of prioritizing U.S. corporate interests over the lives of people around the globe.

“The sheer numbers are horrifying,” said Ife Kilimanjaro, executive director of the nonprofit U.S. Climate Action Network, which works with groups around the world to combat climate change.

“But for us they’re more than numbers,” she added. “These are people with lives, with families, with hopes and dreams. They are people like us, even if they happen to live in a different part of the world.”

The Trump administration, sometimes with the help of congressional Republicans, has dramatically set back efforts to limit climate change, cutting tax credits for clean electricity, fuels, vehicles and manufacturing; easing pollution restrictions on coal-fired power plants; and gutting fuel standards on cars, to name just a few of the climate initiatives that were recently reversed.

“Prior to Trump, we had the most ambitious climate policy that the U.S. has ever come up with — our best effort to date by far of addressing this growing problem,” said Marshall Burke, an economist at the Doerr School of Sustainability at Stanford University.

“When we roll these things back, it is fundamentally affecting the damages we’re going to see around the world,” said Burke.

Responding to questions about the reversals and their projected consequences, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers attacked what she referred to as the “Green Energy Scam.” “America still doesn’t buy the left’s bogus climate claims,” she wrote, without specifically addressing the forecast of heat-related deaths.

The finding that fossil fuels were causing the world to warm first made it to the White House at least 60 years ago, when advisers to President Lyndon Johnson warned that runaway emissions would lead to precisely the extreme events and rapid warming the planet is undergoing today. Scores of experts have denounced the current administration’s disregard for climate science, noting there is overwhelming evidence that human-driven climate change is already causing damage that will only get worse.

When Heat Becomes Deadly

The people most likely to die from rising temperatures are those already disproportionately vulnerable to extreme heat: laborers toiling outdoors; the very old; the very young, who lose fluids especially quickly; people with disabilities and illnesses; and people who lack air conditioning and stable housing.

Extremely high temperatures kill by overwhelming the body’s ability to cool itself. Sweating often ceases. Unconsciousness, organ failure and death follow. Rising temperatures also exacerbate existing health conditions, triggering heart attacks, strokes and respiratory problems that hasten death.

In recent years, climate change has caused the number of deaths from heat exposure to climb around the world. In the U.S., deaths linked to heat have increased more than 50% since 2000, according to a recent study from the Yale School of Public Health.

Hundreds of people died in the Pacific Northwest in 2021, when a high pressure system trapped hot air above parts of the area and caused temperatures to soar well above 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Many of the elderly victims were found alone in their homes, without air conditioning. One farmworker collapsed in a field, another in a plant nursery. A 65-year-old took her last breath in her parked car and was essentially baked by the sun. A team of climate scientists found that the heat wave would have been virtually impossible without human-induced climate change.

Still, when deaths from both heat and cold are considered together, the total number of temperature-related deaths may not appear catastrophic right away. As the planet warms in the next few decades, the global decline in people dying from cold may almost entirely offset deaths from heat. But in the second half of the century, long after Trump has left office, the number of heat-related deaths is expected to greatly outpace the reduction of deaths from cold.

While the U.S. has emitted more climate-warming pollution than any other country, when deaths from both heat and cold are considered together, it is expected to suffer only up to 1% of temperature-related deaths worldwide caused by the additional carbon emissions, according to a working paper by R. Daniel Bressler, an assistant economics professor at Bentley University who developed the concept of the mortality cost of carbon.

Some of the world’s poorest countries will almost certainly struggle to adapt. Niger and Somalia — whose emissions are dwarfed by those of the U.S. — are projected to have the world’s highest per capita death rates from increasing temperatures, Bressler found. India is expected to suffer more temperature-related deaths than any other country. Pakistan, which has just 3% of the world’s population, is expected to have between 6% and 7% of the world’s temperature-related deaths, depending on its ability to adapt to the effects of heat.

Projected Temperature-Related Deaths From Additional Carbon Emissions Compared to Country Population

How disproportionately countries are expected to be impacted relative to their population size.

“People in my community will die,” said Ayisha Siddiqa, a Los Angeles-based climate activist whose family continues to live in her native Pakistan.

Siddiqa, who co-founded the environmental group Future Generations Tribunal, recalled the effect of heat on her family in 2022, when temperatures in Pakistan and India soared above 120 degrees Fahrenheit. Like most people in the region, the Siddiqas do not have air conditioning. Her father, she said, lost consciousness and had to be hospitalized during the deadly heat wave.

“It’s unexplainable,” she said of the heat. “It’s kind of like the entire air around you is sticking to your body and you can’t breathe.”

Progress Reversed

At this time last year, the United States was on track to drastically reduce its emissions.

Under President Joe Biden, the nation made landmark investments to turn away from fossil fuels, the primary driver of climate change, and harness power from the wind and the sun. Hundreds of billions of dollars were being directed toward reducing emissions through a variety of initiatives, such as putting more electric vehicles on the roads and making office buildings and homes more energy efficient.

Biden also reversed Trump’s first-term decision to pull the United States out of the Paris Agreement, the international deal struck a decade ago in which countries pledged to work together to limit global warming.

But as soon as he returned to the White House, Trump began to undo it all. On his first day back, in front of a crowd of cheering supporters wearing MAGA hats, he authorized the United States to again pull out of the Paris Agreement, which he previously deemed a “rip-off.” Just 10 days earlier, the World Meteorological Association had declared 2024 the hottest year on record.

Over the next 100 days, Trump instigated more efforts to roll back climate policies than he had in his entire previous term.

In March, his Environmental Protection Agency celebrated the “biggest deregulatory action in U.S. history” when it announced a slew of actions intended to reverse his predecessor’s efforts to rein in climate change. Among them were regulations that restrict emissions from cars and trucks, limit air pollution from oil and gas operations, and require power plants to capture planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.

Then came the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” Trump’s nickname for the domestic policy megabill he signed in July. The act cut tax incentives for solar and wind energy and electric vehicles; made it easier and cheaper to drill or mine on federal lands; reversed efforts to cut emissions of methane, another greenhouse gas; and increased government support for coal.

Calculating the Lives Lost

To understand the consequences of these moves, ProPublica and the Guardian used the results of modeling from Rhodium Group, an independent, nonpartisan research firm that analyzed the policy changes from this year. The group came up with a high, low and midrange estimate of the amount of additional emissions expected to be released in the next 10 years as a result of the rollbacks the EPA announced in March and the bill passed this summer. (The modeling also reflects changes due to market forces and other factors.)

For our calculation, our starting point was Rhodium Group’s midrange number: 5.7 billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions through 2035. (Using the firm’s other estimates would result in between 571,000 and nearly 2.2 million extra temperature-related deaths due to Trump’s policy changes. The Princeton University-led REPEAT Project conducted a similar analysis and came up with 6.9 billion metric tons, which would result in even more projected deaths.)

To translate those emissions to deaths, ProPublica and the Guardian turned to the field of climate economics, which links human-generated emissions to measurable economic costs. A model that calculates what’s known as the social cost of carbon by Nobel laureate William Nordhaus has been used in federal policy since 2009, guiding everything from requirements mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission to EPA regulations.

While Nordhaus estimated the broad economic cost of climate change, Bressler, the Bentley University professor, used Nordhaus’ model as a starting point but focused on just temperature-related deaths. Drawing also on public health research, Bressler estimated the amount of additional carbon dioxide expected to cause one death over 80 years: 4,434 metric tons. The figure is equivalent to the average lifetime emissions of 3.5 Americans or 146.2 Nigerians. Using the same estimate, Bressler also calculated how many deaths are expected over the course of 80 years from each additional metric ton of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere. He published his findings in Nature Communications in 2021.

In response to questions for this story, the EPA, which recently stopped considering the social cost of carbon at Trump’s direction, rejected Bressler’s scientific analysis. The agency called it “an exercise in moral posturing, not rigorous science” and said that the calculation of deaths per metric ton of carbon is “based on unvalidated extrapolations” and ignores “the dramatic uncertainties that dominate long-term climate projections.”

Climate scientists, however, said that the mortality cost of carbon is a valid metric. Peer reviewers for the 2021 paper that laid out the concept described it as “valuable and intuitive” and relevant for designing policy. After publishing the study, Bressler went on to serve as climate staff economist on the White House Council of Economic Advisers.

Others have emphasized that, because Bressler’s model focuses narrowly on the direct effects of temperature, the estimates it generates are vastly lower than the total death toll from climate change. It also does not capture the serious but non-deadly effects of extreme heat, such as reduced productivity and increased misery.

Bressler acknowledges that his work produces estimates and that the true number of additional deaths due to greenhouse gas emissions will depend on several unknowable factors, including how quickly people adapt to changing temperatures and market forces. Critically, future presidents and other countries could also upend predictions by taking new steps to reduce emissions.

Bressler’s 2021 paper previewed multiple possible futures for the planet. Under what he calls the “pessimistic” scenario, global emissions wouldn’t level off until the end of the century. It was under this scenario that Bressler estimated that, by 2100, climate change will have caused 83 million people to die of temperature-related deaths around the world. This is the scenario that would result in 1.3 million deaths by 2115 from the additional emissions released over the next 10 years as a result of Trump’s policies.

If global emissions were to drop to almost zero by 2050, the total projected toll from temperature-related deaths due to climate change would fall to 9 million by 2100. Even then, Trump’s policy changes this year alone would still result in an additional 613,000 deaths.

Experts agree that, while both of the scenarios Bressler lays out are possible, the most likely amount of emissions will fall between these two extremes. Still, Bressler said, the projections underscore what’s at stake.

“If you do things that add emissions, you cause deaths,” he said. “If you do things that reduce emissions, you save lives.”","https://www.propublica.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/trump-climate-change-deaths-feature_preview_maxWidth_3000_maxHeight_3000_ppi_72_embedColorProfile_true_quality_95.jpg?resize=2000,1333",N,,2025-11-19 12:04:40.716334

Additionally, it is expected for Stellantis to gain Supercharger access across the Tesla Supercharging network for all its EVs (currently more than 28,000 stalls across the impacted five countries — the United States, Canada, Mexico, Japan, and South Korea).

The group has multiple brands, including Jeep, Chrysler, Dodge, Ram, Alfa Romeo, and Fiat.

Stellantis NACS Adoption

Stellantis originally announced in February 2024 that the switch to the NACS (SAE J3400) charging standard would begin in North America in 2025. However, as we are now in November 2025, it seems that the use of NACS charging ports instead of CCS1 will begin in 2026. Stellantis’ electrification plans appear notably delayed and scaled back in general.

Additionally, Stellantis announced the international expansion of SAE J3400 use in Japan and South Korea. That’s a smart move, as Tesla already operates NACS charging infrastructure in both markets. At the same time, it makes little to no sense to develop special versions of its EVs with a CCS1 charging port just for South Korea and with a CHAdeMO charging port, just for Japan.

In other global markets, Stellantis is expected to stick with the CCS2 charging port.

Stellantis Supercharging Access

Gaining native access to the Tesla Supercharging network is the primary reason behind the switch to the NACS (SAE J3400). According to Stellantis, its EVs will gain access to over 28,000 Tesla Supercharging stalls in North America, Japan, and South Korea.

The manufacturer says that its compatible EVs will be able to charge at thousands of Tesla Supercharging locations in North America starting in early 2026. In Japan and South Korea, access is expected in 2027.

Stellantis’ existing EVs (like the Jeep Wagoneer S and Dodge Charger Daytona), equipped with the CCS1 charging port, will require a NACS-to-CCS1 adapter to access Superchargers. The upcoming 2026 Jeep Recon will most likely have a NACS charging inlet (it will need a CCS1-to-NACS adapter to access CCS1 chargers). Details about adapters and access will be shared later.

“Tesla Supercharger network availability will start in 2026 with existing North American BEVs, such as Jeep Wagoneer S and Dodge Charger Daytona, followed by the 2026 Jeep Recon and other future products.”

Overall, it’s good to see that Stellantis moves forward despite some delays. With access to the Tesla Supercharging network, DC fast-charging options significantly increase, as Tesla operates more than half of all public DC charging stalls in the US.",https://evchargingstations.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/JP026_005RE.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 12:06:19.353161

This year, The Greening of Detroit is reaching a landmark 177,000 trees planted since its founding.

That’s long-term stewardship.” Greening work in Detroit also comes with real challenges.","On a fall morning, a group of residents, volunteers and Greening of Detroit staff members stand side by side on vacant block on Detroit’s east side. There are shovels, buckets, work gloves — and a sense of excitement. Each time a tree goes in the ground, it marks more than another sapling added to the city’s growing canopy. It marks an investment in the environment, the neighborhood and the people themselves. And it signals a new sense of pride and hope.

This year, The Greening of Detroit is reaching a landmark 177,000 trees planted since its founding. And for Vice President Monica Tabares, who has been with the organization for 25 years, that number carries a deeper meaning.

“It’s special to be part of an organization that transforms the landscape and lives,” she says. “Our work is immediate and enduring — you can plant trees on a block and instantly make it feel different. But what you don’t always see is the pride, skills, and confidence that also start growing.”

Founded in 1989, The Greening of Detroit began with a focused mission to reforest a city devastated by Dutch elm disease. But over time, the organization evolved into something broader — and more powerful.

“We started as a tree-planting organization, and today, we’re an urban greening and workforce development organization deeply embedded in Detroit’s neighborhoods,” Tabares explains. “We restore tree canopy, educate youth across all Detroit schools, and train residents for meaningful careers in landscaping and forestry.”

Detroit’s tree canopy currently covers about 24% of the city, well below the national average for cities and suburbs. Decades of disinvestment, industrial pollution, and the loss of ash trees have left many neighborhoods hotter, more polluted, and lacking safe green spaces.

That’s why, for Tabares, tree planting is never just about beautification.

“Trees improve air quality, reduce stormwater runoff, lower energy costs, and provide shade in areas that experience some of the worst heat,” she says. “But they’re also about community revitalization and equity. Green lots create safe, healthy spaces where people can live and thrive. It’s an investment.”

Detroit has also faced the effects of increasingly severe storms — another reason urban greenery matters.

“Trees remediate stormwater and pollution. They literally change environmental outcomes. And when you look at equity — the neighborhoods that experienced the most disinvestment historically also face the highest pollution levels. Everyone deserves access to healthy, green, outdoor spaces. It’s basic to livelihood.”

One of the most impactful parts of The Greening of Detroit’s work is its Detroit Conservation Corps, a six-week training program preparing Detroiters – including returning citizens and those with limited job history – for roles in landscaping and forestry.

“Many of our participants have faced barriers to employment,” Tabares says. “They’re looking for opportunity, and there is so much work to be done in this city. We train individuals as landscape technicians and forestry techs, and we connect them to employers. What starts as planting trees often becomes a pathway to a career.”

Just last week, the team celebrated its 71st cohort graduation.

“Several graduates stood up and said this work has changed their lives. Some never completed high school. Some didn’t think doors like this existed for them. But planting trees is a simple and rewarding act. You leave at the end of the day and there’s a forested block. And you realize you helped create it.”

Monica is especially passionate about generational learning. Her belief is that real change starts with young people.

The organization’s Tree Keepers Kids program brings environmental education directly into Detroit schools — helping students understand the purpose and benefits of trees, and how they can contribute to greener neighborhoods.

The Green Corps summer youth employment program — now 26 years old — hires teens aged 14–18 to maintain trees planted across the city.

“It’s more than a summer job,” she says. “We introduce students to career pathways and higher education opportunities in forestry, biology, soil science, conservation, fields many Black and brown students are never exposed to. We’ve had alumni go on to work for the U.S. Forest Service. That’s something we’re incredibly proud of.”

So how does The Greening of Detroit measure success?

“Yes, we track environmental impact,” Tabares says. “But what matters most is community engagement — how residents are involved in shaping their neighborhoods. And we see the social impact: people gain job skills, confidence, and pride. That pride spreads. That’s long-term stewardship.”

Greening work in Detroit also comes with real challenges.

“Our work is scalable and there is so much more we can do, but funding sometimes determines that,” she says.

But Detroit’s geography provides a unique advantage: land.

“We have an abundance of vacant lots. They’re opportunities to keep land clean and green while development plans take shape. It’s almost a blank canvas. We realize some will be developed, but until then, we can plant trees, restore soil, and create healthier spaces.”

For Tabares, this is more than a job. It’s personal.

“I’m a native Detroiter. Being part of this work keeps me very connected to the city,” she says. “For 25 years, I’ve watched blocks transform. I’ve seen residents gain skills that open doors to meaningful careers. I’ve seen young people get their first spark of curiosity and think maybe this could be their future. That keeps me passionate.”

The Greening of Detroit may be approaching 177,000 trees, but perhaps the most enduring growth is harder to count: confidence, pride, stewardship, future careers, and a city redefining what its landscape can look like.

As Tabares puts it,

“Planting trees changes the view from your window. But it also changes people — sometimes when they need it most.”",https://detroitisit.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-19-at-5.58.47-AM-1024x416.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 12:04:49.848754

Spain, which has seen its renewable energy generation capacity increase in recent years, has announced it has opened a €350 million funding round aimed directly at the wind repowering and energy storage upgrades that the nation sees as essential. The announcement was made recently by the nation’s Vice President and Minister for Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge, Sara Aagesen.

Spain has announced an eye-watering funding allocation for the renewable energy sector

Wind power is not the only sector that is set to receive funds from the government, as the government has announced a new aid package for decarbonization and competitiveness in its energy sector. The government has stated that these funds, with a combined amount of €2 billion, will be allocated to projects that boost the industrial value chain and promote the energy transition overall.

Moreover, the Spanish government has noted that several of the planned projects can be implemented after August 31, 2026, which is notably the deadline for justifying the aid received under the Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan (RTRP).

“With just one month to go before the fourth anniversary of the PERTE ERHA (Strategic Plan for the Renewable Energy of the Habitat), half a million actions of all kinds have been implemented, and now we are continuing this work with this new package of measures aimed at further leveraging decarbonization to boost competitiveness.” – Spain’s Vice President and Minister for Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge, Sara Aagesen

The Spanish government has launched a new call for wind repowering and energy-storage upgrades

Building on the planned allocation of funds for the renewable energy sector, the Spanish government has launched a new call for proposals for the wind power sector with a €350 million funding round. The new funding round also covers the manufacturing of other equipment covered by the CISAF (Spanish Association of Energy Efficiency and Manufacturing).

“In short, this package will allow us to advance the model that has enabled us to become a benchmark for economic and environmental progress, industrial modernization, and the fight against climate change.” – Spain’s Vice President Sara Aagesen

The new funding allocation forms part of a broader initiative undertaken by the Spanish government to adapt port infrastructure to develop renewable technologies such as offshore wind power. Regardless of how you might feel about wind power, the sector has grown beyond expectations. That reality has not set in for the United States, as industry leaders have noted that the wind sector is being essentially paralyzed by the government’s permitting stagnation.

Spain is aiming to become a regional leader in the renewable energy sector, and the evidence suggests that the nation is on the right track to achieve its goals of boosting the renewable energy sector over the coming years.

Now the company has launched a new charging infrastructure planning platform specifically designed for commercial EV fleet deployments. The SparkAI platform “combines real-world intelligence, project location-specific datasets, weather forecasts, and a comprehensive global EV database to create optimized charging infrastructure plans for fleet owners and operators.”

Many, if not most, electrification projects face grid capacity limitations that can delay deployments by months or years. SparkAI analyzes specific power needs and available power sources to deliver site-specific configurations in order to help fleets deploy scalable infrastructure quickly.

SparkAI’s intelligence engine cross-analyzes live environmental and geographic data against energy demand forecasts to calculate exact power requirements per site. This can enable charging deployment in areas previously considered uneconomical for electrification, such as rural regions, congested areas, industrial zones and aging grid corridors. The platform can also design hybrid and off-grid charging systems that scale dynamically with fleet growth. SparkCharge’s mobile battery trailers and off-grid power hubs can be deployed anywhere to provide off-grid power where needed.

According to SparkCharge, SparkAI can help fleet operators reduce total infrastructure and operating costs through accurate forecasting and intelligent system sizing. By preventing both costly overbuilding and energy shortfalls, SparkAI improves asset utilization, lowers exposure to peak utility rates, and enables fleets to use off-grid or hybrid energy sources.

“SparkAI isn’t just about faster planning, it’s about smarter energy deployment,” said Joshua Aviv, founder and CEO of SparkCharge. “Right now, we’re channeling that precision into EV charging, helping fleets electrify without overloading the grid. But the bigger opportunity is optimizing how and where energy flows, for EVs and beyond. It’s a smarter grid strategy, powered by real-time intelligence.”

“SparkAI is a game-changer for infrastructure ROI,” said David Piperno, CFO of SparkCharge. “By eliminating over-provisioning and planning delays, we’re helping fleets reduce capital expenditures while accelerating deployment timelines. It’s not just about planning faster, it’s about deploying smarter and scaling profitably.”",https://chargedevs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/6915e432b8876add2a4d122d_Group-11-copy.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 12:04:59.142465

Electric utilities’ growing use of demand response programs to stabilize the power grid represents a cost- and labor-saving opportunity for building owners, particularly multifamily and hotels, according to a whitepaper released last month.

In demand response programs, utilities give building operators an incentive to reduce energy use during peak load periods. Buildings can significantly reduce the labor burden of participating in the programs by automating their systems, HVAC optimization company Parity said in the report.

By enabling seamless demand response participation, HVAC automation can meaningfully cut buildings’ electricity costs at a time when utility rate increases are outpacing the rate of inflation, Parity said. The U.S. Energy Information Administration expects retail electricity prices to rise 13% from 2022 to 2025.

Dive Insight:

Parity’s report lays out a road map for property owners to transform their facilities into “grid-interactive efficient buildings” that are better positioned to use energy more efficiently and make it easier for operators to participate in utility demand response programs.

Technologies that support grid-interactive efficient buildings — occupancy-sensing lighting and HVAC controls, for example — are increasingly common in offices and other types of commercial buildings, Parity said. In multifamily buildings and hotels, the same tools can reduce lighting waste, HVAC load and other power uses in common areas and rooms.

Utility-led demand response programs have historically involved blunt measures like remotely cutting off service to energy-intensive HVAC systems, or less reliable alternatives like asking facility managers to turn down or deactivate equipment. Those requests may not come until a few hours before an event is scheduled to start, if not closer, Parity said.

That picture is changing as utilities move toward more sophisticated programs that leverage virtual power plants, or VPP, which supporters say could reduce peak electric load nationwide by 10% to 20% within a few years. As data centers and building HVAC electrification boost demand for electricity, demand response and VPP programs are among the fastest, lowest-cost options for adding capacity to the grid, enabling the generation of new capacity in a matter of months rather than the several years it takes to build a gas-fired power plant.

Automated HVAC controls improve virtual power plants’ reliability by ensuring that the systems respond when the utility needs them to. That’s especially important for thinly staffed hotels and multifamily buildings whose onsite operations and maintenance personnel often lack the technical skills to fine-tune HVAC or building management systems, or who are reluctant to compromise guests’ comfort, Parity said.

More sophisticated solutions like remote HVAC optimization services, a space Parity competes in, can reduce onsite workloads by 80% to 90% during demand response, the company says. These solutions are also more effective at shifting HVAC power loads while maintaining comfort, such as by pre-cooling interiors in the morning before scheduled demand response events in the afternoon and evening, Parity says.

“Automating demand response turns what was once a reactive, manual process into a seamless, high-value capability,” Brad Pilgrim, CEO and co-founder of Parity, said in a statement.

It fuels businesses, supports families, and gives communities the foundation to grow.

Nowhere is that clearer than in South Carolina, where record population growth and major industrial expansion are pushing electricity demand to unprecedented levels.

Yet many projects that could expand supply and strengthen the grid are stuck waiting on approvals that take years to complete.

These delays stem largely from federal reviews that move far slower than the needs of fast-growing states like South Carolina.

The longer they wait, the higher costs climb for everyone.

The issue is not a lack of investment or ingenuity. South Carolina has become a national magnet for advanced manufacturing, electric vehicle production, aerospace suppliers, and next-generation logistics.

BMW’s continued growth in Spartanburg, Bosch’s battery component expansion, new industrial parks in Greer, Gaffney, and Laurens County, and a wave of suppliers serving Siemens and GE Vernova all depend on a modern, reliable grid.

But the bureaucratic process that governs the infrastructure needed to power these projects, transmission lines, substation upgrades, and grid interconnections moves too slowly and has become overly complex.

Developers often face overlapping reviews, shifting requirements, and legal challenges that can drag on for years.

The 732-mile TransWest Express transmission line from Wyoming to Nevada, for example, took nearly 18 years just to secure permits before breaking ground.

Duke Energy shuffles costs to make proposed Carolinas merger more attractive to SC

To support BMW expansions, battery component suppliers, and new industrial development corridors along the Interstate 85 spine, Duke Energy needs timely approvals for new substations, high-voltage transmission lines, and large-scale grid upgrades that often take longer to permit than to construct.

When these projects stall, reliability and affordability for families and businesses are put at risk.

When projects take too long to build, communities lose out on affordable power, new jobs, and private investment.

According to the global consulting firm McKinsey & Company, as much as $1.5 trillion in infrastructure investment nationwide is tied up in the federal permitting process. A meaningful share of that investment is aimed at fast-growing states like South Carolina — if the infrastructure can actually be built.

Permitting reform is about restoring common sense. It means keeping environmental standards strong while making the approval process clear, efficient, and predictable.

The goal is not to cut corners, but to cut confusion.

That can be done by establishing firm timelines so projects can move from proposal to construction without endless waiting; designating a single coordinating agency to avoid duplicative reviews; prioritizing high-impact projects such as Upstate transmission upgrades; and creating a clear judicial review process so infrastructure that meets every requirement is not stuck in court for years.

Streamlining the process would save time and money without weakening safeguards. Federal reforms are especially important because many transmission projects require approvals from

multiple federal agencies before South Carolina utilities can even begin construction.

Today, a routine transmission line needed to power a new industrial supplier in Spartanburg County can take years longer to approve than to build. Substation upgrades serving fast-growing communities around Greer, Powdersville, and the western Upstate must often navigate multilayered reviews that move more slowly than the growth they are intended to support.

With targeted reforms, builders could move forward with confidence, and communities would benefit from lower costs and greater reliability as new energy sources and delivery systems come online sooner.

Permitting reform also strengthens America’s energy independence, and South Carolina’s competitiveness.

Much of the region’s electric grid is operating with equipment deep into the second half of its lifespan, even as demand accelerates. Federal energy analyses show that the United States will need to double the size of its electric grid by mid-century to support artificial intelligence, manufacturing, electric vehicles, and population growth, all trends already reshaping South Carolina.

When infrastructure can be built faster, energy becomes more affordable and more secure. Local industries, from battery manufacturing in the Midlands to aerospace and advanced-materials

suppliers across the Upstate, can expand with confidence.

And new employers deciding where to invest will see a state prepared for continued growth, not constrained by outdated processes.

Modernizing how projects are approved is not a partisan issue. It is a practical step toward a stronger economy and a more resilient energy system. Families deserve affordable electricity and

reliable service, and they deserve a government that helps make that possible.

The time to act is now. Modernizing the federal permitting process will lower costs, strengthen reliability, and keep energy affordable for every family and business in South Carolina.

The real test is whether society can scale fast enough while ensuring energy remains reliable and affordable for ratepayers —and simultaneously improve emissions intensity throughout the energy system.
Enbridge sits at the center of North America’s energy system, with a proven record of delivering energy where it matters most.
Yet even with a diverse mix of energy sources — and robust domestic energy supply — planning for AI’s resource use remains challenging.","Here’s a fundamental truth: There is no AI without energy. And as the technology grows, its demand for energy and carbon footprint may never again be as small as they are today.

Against this backdrop, debates over which energy source should power AI miss the point. AI’s appetite for energy — relative to what the grid has available today — will demand every tool available. Even if AI growth projections overshoot, energy demand will increase at a scale the power sector hasn’t seen in a generation. The real test is whether society can scale fast enough while ensuring energy remains reliable and affordable for ratepayers —and simultaneously improve emissions intensity throughout the energy system.

Governments and market participants are focused on how best to balance these considerations at a pace that will support America’s competitive advantages.

The U.S. will need new chip factories, new data centers and — most critically — vast new sources of energy, along with the infrastructure to deliver it where it’s needed. Recent reforms outlined in Winning the Race: America’s AI Action Plan aim to accelerate permitting and expedite infrastructure deployment, with the recognition that tomorrow’s energy system will look very different from the one we have today.

Bridging policy ambition with practical delivery requires companies capable of moving energy at scale, making infrastructure essential to the task. Enbridge sits at the center of North America’s energy system, with a proven record of delivering energy where it matters most. Its assets are strategically linked to major population hubs and positioned near the fast-growing data center clusters that will anchor the digital economy.

Being able to move the energy is only one part of the need. A diverse portfolio of energy businesses and capabilities — from natural gas transmission and storage to gas utilities and renewable power operations — is crucial to deliver a mix of energy sources that support clean energy ambitions while ensuring continuous baseload power.

Here’s what that looks like in action: Earlier this year, Enbridge announced that it is developing and will be operating a 600-megawatt solar project near San Antonio, providing renewable power for a customer.

On the Gulf Coast, advanced optimization projects — including a $50-million expansion of the Southeast Supply Header pipeline across Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama — are meeting the growing power needs of a major electric utility serving data centers.

There’s also the expansion of the Texas Eastern Transmission system to support the Homer City Redevelopment generating facility in Pennsylvania. Once fully operational, this will be the largest natural gas-fired power plant in the U.S. dedicated entirely to data centers and AI.

This mix of energy sources and innovation will help to match immediate energy needs with long-term growth projections.

Enbridge’s approach to the energy evolution must include:

Lowering the emissions intensity of operations

Helping customers transition from higher-emitting fuels to lower-carbon options

Building more efficient and lower-carbon infrastructure

Since 2020, Enbridge has reduced greenhouse gas emissions intensity from its operations by 40 percent.

Yet even with a diverse mix of energy sources — and robust domestic energy supply — planning for AI’s resource use remains challenging. Google recently offered data that punctuates this point: A median prompt to its Gemini model consumes 0.24 watt-hours — about the same as running a laptop for 17 seconds or a microwave for one second.

In June, Sam Altman noted in a blog post on AI’s growth that the average ChatGPT query consumes about 0.34 watt-hours of electricity, roughly what a high-efficiency light bulb uses in a couple of minutes.

Numbers like these sharpen public understanding of AI’s energy appetite, but they also expose Jevons paradox — the dynamic in which gains in efficiency lower costs, only to spark even greater demand.

For energy providers, that means data-driven planning and experience will be essential. Data centers will need partners that can deliver capacity, reliability and sustainability — from baseload natural gas to renewables, storage and infrastructure built to meet real demand and support round-the-clock operations.

The paradox also makes clear what’s at stake: As AI expands, innovation will rise or fall on the availability and deliverability of dependable, flexible energy systems.

Meeting this moment will require unprecedented coordination among policymakers, hyperscalers and energy providers.",https://static.politico.com/1e/86/969ad8ff454cbc6d5157cc895994/enbridge-header.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 13:03:00.287538

Campbell power plant in Michigan to operate for an additional 90 days past its original planned retirement date, until February 17, 2026, bringing the total extension to 270 days from when the plant was supposed to shut down. This is the third order issued for the Campbell plant – the Department of Energy first ordered it to remain online past its planned retirement in May and extended it again on August 20.

Consumers Energy committed to retire the plant in 2022 under a settlement approved by Michigan state regulators, finding that replacing the plant with a variety of cleaner resources – including wind, solar, and storage – would reduce costs for Michigan customers. DOE’s series of emergency orders ignore those decisions and are now putting consumers across the Midwest on the hook to keep this aging, expensive, and highly-polluting plant online. According to financial filings from Consumers Energy, the emergency orders have caused the coal plant to rack up over $80 million in losses as of September 30 – over $600,000 a day – which are continuing to accumulate. Those costs will be recovered from millions of families and businesses in Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wisconsin.

“Mandating aging, unreliable and costly coal plants to stay open past their retirement is a guaranteed way to needlessly hike up Americans’ electricity bills and make air pollution worse,” saidTed Kelly, Director and Lead Counsel for U.S. Clean Energy at Environmental Defense Fund. “The barely working Campbell plant, which has burned through over $600,000 in losses every day under DOE’s unlawful orders, proves that this is a failed strategy for our country’s growing electricity needs.

“These half-a-century old plants are simply too expensive to operate, too dangerous for our health and break down too often to be counted on. To keep costs down, we should be unleashing – not blocking – the cheapest, fastest and cleanest sources of electricity onto our grid, including solar, wind and battery projects.

“EDF and allies will continue to fight these illegal and completely unnecessary emergency orders in court.”

Despite claims from the Trump administration that coal is “reliable,” data from North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) shows that coal experiences the most outages from equipment failures of any power source in the U.S.

Case in point: In June, the Campbell plant partially broke down when DOE claimed it was important for maintaining reliability. Only one unit was even producing power because another unit had been broken for weeks and the third abruptly shut off.

The regional grid operator (MISO) had a surplus of resources greater than ten times the power provided by Campbell because the grid operator and utility were prepared for its retirement. Moreover, NERC’s latest annual winter reliability assessment, also released yesterday, concluded that MISO has sufficient resources to meet electricity needs even in situations with extreme levels of demand and generator outages.",https://www.edf.org/themes/edf2020/favicons/favicon-96x96.png,N,,2025-11-19 11:05:04.020758

DALLAS, TEXAS (November 19, 2025) – Monday, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin shared 100 additional environmental accomplishments EPA has achieved in the last 100 days, recognizing 300 days of fulfilling the agency’s statutory obligations, and delivering clean air, land, and water for all Americans under President Donald Trump's leadership.

EPA Region 6 led the response to the Smitty’s Supply fire in Roseland, Louisiana, to remove over 11 million gallons of waste from the Tangipahoa River and surrounding waterways and engage with over 3,000 residents. Region 6 also issued a Safe Drinking Water Act permit for ExxonMobil’s Rose Low Carbon Solutions Class VI injection wells in Jefferson County and a Clean Air Act permit to Texas GulfLink for a deepwater port southeast of Freeport. These permits enable significant projects to move forward, creating jobs and boosting the nation’s energy economy. Region 6 also provided oversight of the depressurization of four flanged tritium waste containers at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. Air monitoring for tritium indicated no deviation from background levels.

Nationwide, this progress includes announcing a proposed rule that establishes a clear, durable, common-sense definition of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS), completing 100 days of ""pressure testing"" Tijuana-San Diego wastewater projects from the July 2025 U.S.-Mexico Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and accelerating timelines by nine months, secured our border from dangerous illegal pesticides through enforcement action, led emergency response efforts and cleanup efforts in communities across the nation, and so much more.

These 100 actions build on Administrator Zeldin’s list of 100 pro-environmental actions taken by the agency during President Trump’s First 100 Days in office and another 100 pro-environmental actions highlighted at the 200-day milestone to total 300 featured accomplishments.

""We are thrilled to announce another 100 top accomplishments from the last 100 days in our mission to meet our statutory duties and defend human health and environmental quality,"" said EPA Administrator Zeldin. ""The Trump EPA is showing that we can be exceptional environmental stewards while Powering the Great American Comeback. 300 days, 300 major environmental wins – this is the energy that propels us forward and the pace that motivates us. We will keep working tirelessly to secure success after success for America's environment and families nationwide.""

“EPA Region 6 is home to much of our nation’s energy, industry, and agriculture production as well as diverse landscapes and natural resources. Under the Trump Administration, our team has shown we can fulfill our mission to protect human health and the environment while not getting in the way of the economic development that’s Powering the Great American Comeback,” said Regional Administrator Scott Mason. “We have accomplished a great deal in less than a year, and we’ll keep pushing to do even more for the environment, the economy, and the American people.”

This snapshot represents the great work done by the agency on a daily basis as EPA continues to fulfill its core mission of protecting human health and the environment, while committing to commonsense policies that drive down prices, unleash American energy, advance permitting reform and cooperative federalism, make America the AI capital of the world, and revitalize the auto industry.

Led emergency response at Smitty’s Supply explosion and fire in Louisiana deploying 464 EPA employees and contractors to conduct air monitoring and recover 7,622,181 gallons of oily waste and 3,769,668 gallons of CERCLA waste from the Tangipahoa River.

Delivered as part of a US$10 billion five-year investment plan announced on 12 November, this latest funding boost will create 252 new jobs, according to Toyota. The investment will, it said, increase hybrid capacity and bring hybrid-electric Corollas to its production lineup.

The latest investment is split between Toyota’s plants in West Virginia (US$453 million), Kentucky (US$204.4 million), Mississippi (US$125 million), Tennessee (US$71.4 million) and Missouri (US$57.1 million).

The Mississippi plant will begin the first assembly of an electrified Corolla model in the US. Other plants will increase or begin production of parts for hybrid vehicles including transaxles and engine blocks.

Toyota currently assembles about half of the vehicles it sells globally in the US, with facilities in the country assembling 76% of its vehicles sold in the US market. It does import some core components of its hybrid vehicles to the US from its Japanese facilities, though the proportion of those is not disclosed.

Toyota has also launched operations at its US$13.9 billion North Carolina EV battery facility, marking the company’s first battery manufacturing plant outside of Japan.

Its North Carolina plant will produce up to 30GWh annually at full capacity and produce lithium-ion batteries for its portfolio of its electrified vehicles—including hybrids, plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) and all electric vehicles.

The company said its ‘multi-pathway powertrain’ approach is driving growth in electrified vehicles, which account for just under half of its US sales.

There is room for some to speculate that the move to increase manufacturing capacity in the US is a means of reducing cost in response to the trade tariffs imposed by US president Donald Trump.

Toyota’s senior vice president of manufacturing operations Kevin Voelkel said customers are embracing the carmaker’s hybrid vehicles, and the manufacturing teams “are gearing up to meet that growing demand”.

“Toyota’s philosophy is to build where we sell, and by adding more American jobs and investing across our U.S. footprint, we continue to stay true to that philosophy,” Voelkel said.

Hybrid EVs and the electrification of transport

HEVs and PHEVs are generally regarded as a softer way to transition to cleaner transport—the inclusion of the technology in several nations’ transport decarbonisation legislation in part represents this.

However, it also represents carmakers’ reluctance to completely retool manufacturing plants within the timeframes set for transport emissions reductions.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt452efb5f3e725f7e/blt135d7077816ed9ea/691dd5b7e4a3b00e860503ca/Hybrid-Investment-2025_Hero-Image.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-11-19 11:03:28.875354

Covid-19 Scenario:

The outbreak of COVID-19 had a negative effect on the global electric vehicle solid state battery market, as it disrupted the entire global automotive supply chain.

At the same time, the demand for electric vehicles decreased drastically due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The biggest issues the automotive industry faced because of COVID-19 included a limited supply of auto parts, a decline in new car sales, the closure of manufacturing plants, and a loss of working capital.

However, in the post-pandemic period, significant market players funded the creation of solid-state batteries to address problems with batteries like thermal performance and discharge rate, among others. For instance, the American company QuantumScape has developed solid-state lithium-metal batteries for use in electric vehicles.

Leaders from Europe, Australia and Canada, making ever-larger climate promises with ever-emptier rhetoric, ignore the crucial reality that Western actions are no longer central to solving climate change.

It’s time they recognize that real progress depends on innovation, not increasingly costly restrictions.

For decades, Western governments have made carbon cuts their mission.

They’ve spent trillions pushing electric cars and unreliable wind and solar energy, but their pricey programs are barely making a dent.

The global decarbonization rate has stayed roughly constant since the 1960s.

The 2015 Paris Agreement brought no improvement — in fact, global emissions hit a new record high in 2024.

Despite this, climate campaigners unrealistically demand the world quadruple its decarbonization rate.

Why are emissions still rising, even though the EU and US spent more than $700 billion in 2024 on green investments?

Because rich-world emissions now matter less than ever before.

While the West dominated carbon emissions in the past, future emissions will overwhelmingly come from China, India, Africa, Brazil, Indonesia and other countries clambering out of poverty.

One recent scenario shows that with current policies, just 13% of CO₂ emissions for the rest of this century will come from OECD countries.

So the liberal West’s net-zero pledge for 2050 will cost hundreds of trillions of dollars, but deliver little.

Most likely, these policies will simply push energy-intensive industries to the rest of the world — as electric-car-battery manufacturing has already shifted to China’s coal-powered economy.

The EU’s coming carbon border taxes, which will slap extra fees on imported high-emission goods, will only escalate costs further for both rich and poor countries.

Even if the West managed to eliminate all its emissions by 2050, the impact on global temperatures would be tiny: a 0.04°F reduction by 2050 and less than 0.2°F by 2100, according to the UN’s climate model.

Despite this limited relevance, climate summits and activists fixate on what the rich world should do.

Protesters glue themselves to highways in Europe and the United States while largely ignoring China and disregarding India, Africa and the rest of the developing world.

Small wonder: Their message of self-sacrifice holds no appeal in countries that urgently need affordable energy for development.

Poorer nations are not looking to emulate Germany’s climate-driven debt, Spain’s green blackouts or the UK’s record electricity prices.

There is a cheaper and far more promising alternative: innovation.

Throughout history, humanity has overcome major challenges not by restricting growth, but by inventing better solutions.

When smog choked Los Angeles in the 1950s, we didn’t ban cars; we created the catalytic converter.

When much of the world faced hunger in the 1960s, we didn’t mandate rationing; we developed higher-yield crops.

We now need similar breakthroughs in green energy — yet innovation is precisely what the world is neglecting.

In 1980, after the oil shocks, rich countries spent more than 8 cents of every $100 of GDP on green R&D to find energy alternatives.

But as fossil fuels became cheaper, that investment dropped — and when climate concerns rose, governments funneled funds into subsidizing inefficient wind and solar rather than boosting innovation.

By 2023, the rich world spent less than 4 cents per $100 of GDP — just $27 billion, under 2% of all green spending — on research.

This must change. The West should increase green-energy R&D to around $100 billion a year.

That relatively modest investment could potentially enable breakthroughs across a broad range of technologies: fourth-generation nuclear, scalable green hydrogen and water purification, next-generation batteries, CO₂-free oil harvested from algae, carbon capture, fusion, advanced biofuels and many others.

None of these promising technologies is efficient — yet — but innovation only needs to make one or a few of them a better deal than fossil fuels.

Once that happens, every nation will adopt them: Innovation promises a global solution, whereas Western emissions cuts barely register.

Crucially, innovation costs only a tiny fraction of what today’s net-zero plans demand.

Instead of pouring resources into subsidies and mandates that raise prices and shift emissions abroad, we could spend comparatively little to make clean energy inherently competitive.

Yet the climate-obsessed politicians from Europe, Canada and Australia negotiating in Belém remain blind to the necessity of green R&D.

President Donald Trump didn’t show up at COP30, or even send a representative.

Instead, his administration should step forward to lead the charge on pragmatic energy policies.

His practical influence could rally others toward an affordable path that’s far smarter than pouring billions into symbolic gestures that barely move the needle.

It’s time for the West to recognize its limitations — and pivot from wasteful spending to game-changing tech investments that actually deliver results.

Hill",,,,,https://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/environmental-law/1707214/texas-granted-primacy-over-class-vi-wells-streamlining-carbon-capture-and-storage-permitting,"Primacy is viewed as a critical step toward streamlining and significantly accelerating the permitting process for carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects across the state.
Texas is now the sixth state to receive primacy for its Class VI UIC program from EPA, joining Arizona, West Virginia, Louisiana, Wyoming and North Dakota.
The EPA will conduct regular reviews of the RRC's Class VI UIC program to ensure that it is effective and continues to meet or exceed federal standards.
Texas' Class VI UIC primacy solidifies its position as a leader for the development of the CCS industry in the U.S.
With the regulatory landscape for Class VI UIC in Texas firming up, the implementation of commercial-scale CO2 storage in the state is expected to accelerate.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on Nov. 12, 2025, announced a final rule granting the State of Texas primary implementation and enforcement authority (also known as primacy) for Class VI Underground Injection Control (UIC) wells when EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin signed the pre-publication version of the final rule on behalf of the agency.

This important decision supports cooperative federalism goals by transferring the sole authority for permitting wells used for geologic carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration from the EPA to the Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC). Primacy is viewed as a critical step toward streamlining and significantly accelerating the permitting process for carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects across the state. Texas is now the sixth state to receive primacy for its Class VI UIC program from EPA, joining Arizona, West Virginia, Louisiana, Wyoming and North Dakota. The final rule will become effective 30 days after publication in the Federal Register, which is expected at any time.

As analyzed in Holland & Knight's previous alert, ""The Path to Class VI Primacy in Texas: MOA Reveals State and Federal Review,"" the EPA and RRC established a memorandum of agreement detailing how application reviews would be coordinated during the transition, as well as how EPA will provide oversight to the RRC. The EPA will conduct regular reviews of the RRC's Class VI UIC program to ensure that it is effective and continues to meet or exceed federal standards. Accordingly, the EPA will maintain a seat beside the RRC in a role of programmatic review.

Texas' Class VI UIC primacy solidifies its position as a leader for the development of the CCS industry in the U.S. This grant of primacy to the RRC is anticipated to reduce ""red tape"" and delays associated with federal EPA review, which can take years to complete following an already lengthy application process due to the engineering and geologic complexity of Class VI UIC wells and the CCS projects they support.

Unlike other similar agencies in other states, the RRC seems uniquely well positioned to follow through on this promise, as it can leverage its extensive experience in permitting other wells (including all types of UIC wells) and deep staff experience to provide a more efficient and predictable regulatory framework. As of Nov. 12, 2025, the RRC has 18 applicants currently under review and anticipates additional applications in the coming weeks. In its accompanying press release, the RRC remains laser focused in support its new Class VI UIC program, noting that primacy will ""provide certainty for energy companies looking to invest in CCS development.""

Next Steps

For energy companies and investors in the CCS space, this development presents a significant opportunity, given Texas' favorable geologic conditions. If CCS projects can be supported by a streamlined and predictable permitting timeline, project risk can be reduced, thereby supporting viability. Companies now have multiple opportunities to ensure that these new primacy considerations are embedded into and support their CCS projects in Texas. Those planning projects should consider engaging with counsel to understand the nuances of the new RRC-specific requirements, as well as help navigate any subsequent challenges to the Texas primacy rule. Similarly, those already holding federal Class VI UIC permits should consider risks and opportunities associated with the process of transfer from EPA to RRC jurisdiction.

In addition, companies should consider the benefits of engaging in the RRC's process at the earliest feasible date to ensure that permit applications receive the most favorable slot in the queue for RRC review. With the regulatory landscape for Class VI UIC in Texas firming up, the implementation of commercial-scale CO2 storage in the state is expected to accelerate.

Some Wisconsin utilities do offer their own community solar programs.
That means legislation is necessary to specify that other companies are also allowed to generate and sell power from community solar.
Minnesota utility Xcel Energy, for example, supported terminating the state’s community solar program during an unsuccessful effort by some lawmakers last summer to end it.
The Wisconsin bill would also require utilities to buy power from community solar arrays that don’t have enough subscribers.","On a dry, rocky patch of his family’s farm in Door County, Wisconsin, Dave Klevesahl grows wildflowers. But he has a vision for how to squeeze more value out of the plot: lease it to a company that wants to build a community solar array.

Unfortunately for Klevesahl, that is unlikely to happen under current state law. In Wisconsin, only utilities are allowed to develop such shared solar installations, which let households and businesses that can’t put panels on their own property access renewable energy via subscriptions.

Farmers, solar advocates, and legislators from both parties are trying to remove these restrictions through Senate Bill 559, which would allow the limited development of community solar by entities other than utilities.

Wisconsin lawmakers considered similar proposals in the 2021–2022 and 2023–2024 legislative sessions, with support from trade groups representing real estate agents, farmers, grocers, and retailers. But those bipartisan efforts failed in the face of opposition from the state’s powerful utilities and labor unions.

Community solar supporters are hoping for a different outcome this legislative session, which ends in March. But while the new bill, introduced Oct. 24, includes changes meant to placate utilities, the companies still firmly oppose it.

“I don’t really understand why anybody wouldn’t want community solar,” said Klevesahl, whose wife’s family has been farming their land for generations. In addition to leasing his land for an installation, he would like to subscribe to community solar, which typically saves participants money on their energy bills.

Some Wisconsin utilities do offer their own community solar programs. But they are too small to meet the demand for community solar, advocates say.

Utilities push back on shared solar

Around 20 states and Washington, D.C., have community solar programs that allow non-utility ownership of arrays. The majority of those states, including Wisconsin’s neighbor Illinois, have deregulated energy markets, in which the utilities that distribute electricity do not generate it.

In states with ​“vertically integrated” energy markets, like Wisconsin, utilities serve as regulated monopolies, both generating and distributing power. That means legislation is necessary to specify that other companies are also allowed to generate and sell power from community solar. Some vertically integrated states, including Minnesota, have passed such laws.

But monopoly utilities in those jurisdictions have consistently opposed community solar developed by third parties. Minnesota utility Xcel Energy, for example, supported terminating the state’s community solar program during an unsuccessful effort by some lawmakers last summer to end it.

The Wisconsin utilities We Energies and Madison Gas and Electric, according to their spokespeople, are concerned that customers who don’t subscribe to community solar will end up subsidizing costs for those who do. The utilities argue that because community solar subscribers have lower energy bills, they contribute less money for grid maintenance and construction, meaning that other customers must pay more to make up the difference. Clean-energy advocates, for their part, say this ​“cost shift” argument ignores research showing that the systemwide benefits of distributed energy like community solar can outweigh the expense.

The Wisconsin bill would also require utilities to buy power from community solar arrays that don’t have enough subscribers.

“This bill is being marketed as a ​‘fair’ solution to advance renewables. It’s the opposite,” said We Energies spokesperson Brendan Conway. ​“It would force our customers to pay higher electricity costs by having them subsidize developers who want profit from a no-risk solar project. Under this bill, the developers avoid any risk. The costs of their projects will shift to and be paid for by all of our ​‘non-subscribing’ customers.”

The power generated by community solar ultimately goes onto the utility’s grid, reducing the amount of electricity the utility needs to provide. But Conway said it’s not the most efficient way to meet overall demand.

“These projects would not be something we would plan for or need, so our customers would be paying for unneeded energy that benefits a very few,” he said. ​“Also, these credits are guaranteed by our other customers even if solar costs drop or grid needs change.”

Advocates in Wisconsin hope they can address such concerns and convince utilities to support community solar owned by third parties.

Beata Wierzba, government affairs director of the clean-power advocacy organization Renew Wisconsin, said her group and others ​“had an opportunity to talk with the utilities over the course of several months, trying to negotiate some language they could live with.”

“There were some exchanges where utilities gave us a dozen things that were problematic for them, and the coalition addressed them by making changes to the draft” of the bill, Wierzba said.

The spokespeople for We Energies and Madison Gas and Electric did not respond to questions about such conversations.

A small-scale start

To assuage utilities’ concerns, the bill allows third-party companies to build community solar only for the next decade. The legislation also sets a statewide cap for community solar of 1.75 gigawatts, with limits for each of the five major investor-owned utilities’ territories proportionate to each utility’s total number of customers.

Community solar arrays would be limited to 5 megawatts, with exceptions for rooftops, brownfields, and other industrial sites, where 20 megawatts can be built.

No subscriber would be allowed to buy more than 40% of the output from a single community solar array, and 60% of the subscriptions must be for 40 kilowatts of capacity or less, the bill says. This is meant to prevent one large customer — like a big-box store or factory — from buying the majority of the power and excluding others from taking advantage of the limited community solar capacity.

Customers who subscribe to community solar would still have to pay at least $20 a month to their utility for service. The bill also contains what Wierzba called an ​“off-ramp”: After four years, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin would study how the program is working and submit a report to the legislature, which could pass a new law to address any problems.

“The bill is almost like a small pilot project — it’s not like you’re opening the door and letting everyone come in,” said Wierzba. ​“You have a limit on how it can function, how many people can sign up.”

Broad support for community solar

In Wisconsin, as in other states, developers hoping to build utility-scale solar farms on agricultural land face serious pushback. The Trump administration canceled federal incentives for solar arrays on farms this summer, with U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announcing, ​“USDA will no longer fund taxpayer dollars for solar panels on productive farmland.”

But Wisconsin farmers have argued that community solar can actually help keep agricultural land in production by providing an extra source of revenue. The Wisconsin Farm Bureau Federation has yet to weigh in on this year’s bill, but it supported previously proposed community solar legislation.

The bill calls for state regulators to come up with rules for community solar developers that would likely require dual use — meaning that crops or pollinator habitats are planted under and around the panels or that animals graze on the land. These increasingly common practices are known as agrivoltaics.

Utility-scale solar farms, by contrast, are permitted at the state level, which can leave ​“locals feeling like they are not in control of their future,” said Matt Hargarten, vice president of government and public affairs for the Coalition for Community Solar Access. ​“This offers an alternative that is really welcome. If a town doesn’t want this to be there, it won’t be there.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Solar-panels-in-Wisconsin.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=0e21115777ec63187ddd7bbbb6ec8196,N,,2025-11-19 11:04:23.208978

EPB was able to switch the neighborhood over to battery power for about half an hour until the job was done.

So it won’t be able to help with local reliability in Chattanooga, the way that the community batteries do.","Due north of Chattanooga, a power line runs through a wooded tract called Sale Creek before it dead-ends at the Tennessee River. On Oct. 8, this line lost power. But the lights stayed on for nearly 400 customers because Sale Creek has a new tool to neutralize outages.

Chattanooga’s municipal utility, EPB, had installed a Tesla Megapack battery system on this lonely stretch of the distribution grid back in June. If anything knocked out the line, residents would have 2.5 megawatts/​10 megawatt-hours of storage capacity at their disposal while crews fixed the problem.

In this case, utility workers unexpectedly needed to de-energize the line to finish making repairs. EPB was able to switch the neighborhood over to battery power for about half an hour until the job was done. Without the battery, EPB would have had to tell its customers it was cutting off their power on purpose.

“This was the first time we used it in an outage situation,” said Ryan Keel, president of the energy and communications business unit at EPB. ​“In the future, it’ll be even more unplanned. It’ll be a response to a tree falling through the line or a car hitting a pole or something.”

EPB, which serves some 500,000 people across 600 square miles, plans to roll out more targeted, resilience-oriented batteries to other outage-prone stretches of its grid. The nonprofit public power company currently has a 45-megawatt fleet of batteries, almost all of which were built this year. Besides keeping the lights on, they save money for the whole customer base by lowering the utility’s peak electricity consumption.

The United States is racing toward yet another record year of grid battery construction, as power companies tap lithium-ion batteries to store solar power, improve grid reliability, and free up capacity for new data centers. Most of these batteries are getting installed in California and Texas, where they’ve pushed down wholesale prices and banished heat wave–induced power shortages. Utilities elsewhere, though, too often bide their time in exhaustive studies of the technology, which is new by their standards, despite its mass deployment in some regions.

But batteries are starting to catch on in Tennessee: The Tennessee Valley Authority, the federal entity that generates electricity for EPB and scores of other local power companies, just committed to build 1.5 gigawatts of grid batteries across its territory by the close of 2029, its largest battery deployment by far. The TVA board approved this in its November meeting, setting the stage for the utility to solicit competitive bids from battery developers, spokesperson Scott Fiedler told Canary Media.

And although Chattanooga’s battery buildout is far smaller than what’s happening farther west, or even the installations planned by TVA, it shows how a responsive local utility can adopt new clean-energy technology to make life a little better for its customers. It doesn’t take a massive R&D budget or piles of cash from Wall Street shareholders — just a willingness to embrace a readily available technology.

Rolling blackouts prompt battery buildout

EPB had explored batteries for years. It researched them with the Department of Energy and Oak Ridge National Laboratory, located 100 miles northeast of Chattanooga. But EPB moved beyond research and installed a solar-and-battery microgrid at the Chattanooga Airport, learning how to work with the technology in practice.

Building on that experience, EPB leaders took a new look at batteries after Winter Storm Elliott rocked the region just before Christmas 2022, leaving TVA short on supply as households cranked their electric heating. For the first time since its founding in 1933, the TVA had to cut power to its customers in order to avoid damaging the grid infrastructure. So it told local power companies that they had to reduce demand by a certain amount.

“That event shaped our strategy,” Keel said. ​“We want to deploy a large amount [of batteries], because it gives us some local insulation from what may be happening on the TVA system that could impact our customers.”

Homes in TVA’s territory use a lot of electric heating and cooling, which drives grid peaks in both winter and summer. Typical hot summer and cold winter peaks for EPB reach 1,200 megawatts of demand, Keel said, but the utility set a demand record above 1,300 megawatts this January.

That means the current battery fleet meets just a small percentage of the total peak demand — enough to help on the margins, but pretty limited in its impact. Keel said his strategy is to raise that capacity to around 150 megawatts.

“Our hope is that if TVA calls for a 10% required reduction of our load, we can achieve that completely with the battery systems that we’ve put in, and we don’t need to do any unplanned outages to customers at all, like we had to” during Winter Storm Elliott, Keel said.

That battery strategy is akin to an insurance policy, responding to the concerning frequency of polar vortices and extreme heat in recent years. But the batteries don’t just sit around waiting for record cold snaps or heat waves. When the batteries aren’t acting as local backup, EPB puts them to work to save money for all customers.

When EPB buys power from TVA, it pays a demand charge for the hour of highest consumption each month. By discharging the batteries when it looks like a peak hour is approaching, EPB can shave its monthly charge. That lowers the rates it pays to TVA, which puts downward pressure on utility bills for Chattanooga residents.

“We make our decisions based on community benefit,” said J. Ed. Marston, EPB’s vice president for strategic communication. ​“The more we can keep our costs down operationally, the more we can avoid having to do electric rate increases that impact our customers.”

This dynamic parallels the way Vermont utility Green Mountain Power pays for a program that helps customers install home batteries: The utility dispatches all the small-scale batteries to reduce its peak-demand charges to the New England grid operator.

EPB expects to get payback on its battery installations within five years from the reliability and peak-demand uses. The utility has elected not to run the batteries on a daily basis, because the wear and tear that frequent cycling puts on batteries offsets the benefit of short-term savings on energy charges. (TVA territory doesn’t have wholesale markets that let batteries bid in for various services to make money.)

Chattanooga’s history of early tech adoption

EPB’s battery buildout puts it ahead of many bigger peers, in both absolute and relative terms.

It’s part of a pattern of the municipal utility embracing new technology to help its residents.

Perhaps most strikingly, the nonprofit installed fiber internet in city homes in 2009, before for-profit telecom providers were widely offering it. EPB became the first company to sell gig-speed internet to an entire community network, Keel said. (Current monthly rate for 1-gig Wi-Fi: an envy-inducing $67.99.)

That fiber also improves the efficiency of the electric grid: EPB piggybacked on the fiber to upgrade its grid network to advanced metering infrastructure, which sends real-time information to the utility and allows it to respond instantly to issues. EPB won accolades for the number of ​“smart grid” automated devices on its high-voltage distribution system per mile or per customer, Keel said.

“EPB has been incredibly impressive and forward-thinking and on the leading edge — sometimes maybe even on the bleeding edge — of technology innovation, all in the spirit of working for the benefit of their customers,” said Matt Brown, regional vice president for the Tennessee Valley at Silicon Ranch, the major solar developer based in Nashville.

Silicon Ranch is working with EPB on a different kind of money-saving clean-energy project. A large-scale solar project in West Tennessee will produce 33 megawatts for EPB as part of TVA’s Generation Flexibility program, which lets local power companies generate up to 5% of their annual demand. The project is slated to be operating by mid-2028.

That solar development will be located outside EPB’s territory, where there’s more land available. So it won’t be able to help with local reliability in Chattanooga, the way that the community batteries do. But it will generate power at cheaper rates than those of TVA, which itself has cheaper rates than most U.S. utilities, meaning that EPB can pass those savings to its customers.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/2025.10.17-Sale-Creek-Energy-Storage-Installation_2025-11-19-140856_gxyj.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=80&w=1200&s=9ec49ed699f2ae5d755a2b863e7b3b00,N,,2025-11-19 14:03:08.022908

States can make climate change-fueled disasters less damaging, saving lives and dollars, by using federal hazard mitigation funding in combination with policies to consider future climate conditions in designing and implementing projects using that funding. Without sustained hazard mitigation investments guided by climate change-focused policies, states risk falling into a costly cycle of responding to more and more damaging disasters, with deeper, longer-lasting impacts on budgets and lives.

While federal disaster funding for rebuilding and harm mitigation often doesn’t require states to consider how future disasters could affect people, communities, and property, states can tap important federal resources and use them to mitigate future risk. States must apply for most post-disaster hazard mitigation funding and should have specific policies in place to make the best use of the federal funding they receive:

States should foster cross-agency coordination on hazard mitigation and climate adaptation by:

Establishing a resilience office to provide leadership and policy direction, data and analysis capacity, and monitoring of outcomes.

Creating a statewide climate adaptation plan to establish a shared vision, goals, objectives, and project pipelines.

Setting up working groups or commissions to support communication and foster collaborative projects.

States should require consideration of future risk in hazard mitigation investments by:

Mandating that infrastructure projects requiring state approval use future climate projections in decision-making.

Providing support to local governments so that land use policies, zoning policies, and building codes and standards reflect projections about future conditions under a changing climate.

States should direct hazard mitigation funding where the negative effects of climate change-fueled disasters fall hardest — that is, to communities of color (particularly Black, Latine, and American Indian and Alaska Native communities) and low-income communities — by:

Setting policies directing a specific percentage of funds to these communities.

Requiring a certain proportion of investment benefits to accrue to them.

Establishing requirements for meaningful participation of community members in investment decisions.

Growing Disaster Costs Highlight Need to Adapt to Climate Risks

Climate change, which is causing hazards such as storms, wildfires, droughts, and floods to become more frequent and severe, is the leading contributor to rising disaster costs across the country. Between 2008 and 2024, the United States experienced 267 climate-related disaster events each causing at least $1 billion in damage — an average of 15 per year. (See Figure 1. ) Since the 2010s, the frequency of billion-dollar disasters has increased, from about 13 events per year in the 2010s to 27 events in 2024.

To reduce the loss of lives and livelihoods — as well as the cost to state, local, tribal, and territorial governments — all levels of government and sectors of society must act to reduce climate pollution and adapt to climate impacts. Climate adaptation requires understanding and planning for climate risks as well as upgrading infrastructure, management practices, and policies so that communities can adapt to changing conditions and decrease disaster risk.

The current U.S. disaster funding system dates back to the late 1980s and has not been sufficiently updated to ensure that funds are used to better protect people and communities from future risks. Federal resources can and should be better targeted to helping states and communities build resilience to climate impacts. The Trump Administration has created a new set of challenges by delaying or stopping badly needed disaster funding and causing significant uncertainty about what funds will be provided in future disasters. It also has reversed Biden policies that sought to orient post-disaster funding more toward protection from future disasters. Litigation is ongoing regarding the Administration’s funding delays, and it is critical that the process for awarding funds not be politicized.

The good news, however, is that states can choose on their own to use available federal funding to prepare for the worsening hazards that a climate-changed future is bringing and lessen future disaster impacts.

Federal Hazard Mitigation Funding Enables Critical Safety Investments

The Stafford Act of 1988 mandates that the federal government help cover disaster response and recovery costs that state and local governments are unable to meet. The majority of Stafford Act funding is for immediate relief and recovery efforts. It includes Public Assistance to states for things like debris removal and emergency building repairs and Individual Assistance to individuals for things like housing and counseling. This funding is critical for rebuilding lives and livelihoods post-disaster, but it is not designed to help communities reduce the risk of future disasters and adapt to climate change.

However, the Stafford Act and other mechanisms also enable support to states for “hazard mitigation” — that is, actions taken to reduce the risk that a hazard such as flood, fire, or extreme storm poses to lives, livelihoods, and property in a given place over the long term. When hazard mitigation efforts incorporate risk assessments and vulnerability analyses that account for projections of future climate conditions, they can constitute effective climate change adaptation.

Federal hazard mitigation funding is a significant share of the federal funding available to help states adapt and build resilience to climate impacts. States rely on these funds to make cost-saving, life-preserving upgrades to buildings, roads, and critical infrastructure, with projects reducing future disaster response and recovery costs by as much as $13 for every $1 invested. With this funding, states can simultaneously help achieve hazard mitigation and climate change adaptation needs, but only if they consider future climate conditions in designing and implementing the projects. For example, rather than simply rebuild a structure in the same place and to the same standards following a major flood, a state could use information about future flood risk to understand how much to elevate that structure or determine that it needs to be moved.

The federal government administers two types of hazard mitigation funding through FEMA and other agencies: post-disaster funding, which is available only in the wake of a Presidential Major Disaster Declaration, and pre-disaster funding, which is distributed on a competitive basis irrespective of a current disaster declaration.

Post-Disaster Hazard Mitigation Programs

This funding is distributed based on an assessment of the damage the disaster has caused and the estimated project costs for needed rebuilding.

FEMA Public Assistance (PA): State governments request PA as part of their Presidential Major Disaster Declaration request. For certain PA-funded projects, known as “permanent” projects, states can work with FEMA to incorporate hazard mitigation measures into the project. These projects must be completed within 18 months of the disaster. Funds can be used to repair and rebuild public infrastructure such as roads, public buildings, and water systems.

For example, the city of Mexico Beach, Florida used $2.7 million in PA funds to implement climate resilience and environmental improvement projects that better protect the community against future flooding and created recreational amenities with multiple social, environmental, and economic benefits.

FEMA Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP): State governments request HMGP funds as part of their Presidential Major Disaster Declaration request. If the funding is approved, local governments can then apply as sub-applicants for funding to the state applicant based on state-identified priorities. HMGP funds can be used for a variety of hazard mitigation project types, including creating and updating hazard mitigation plans, purchasing property, upgrading assets, and improving environmental conditions.

For example, HMGP funds were used to install hurricane-resistant retrofits at Nicklaus Children’s Hospital in Miami. With these retrofits, the hospital was able to shelter patients, employees, and families through several Florida hurricanes, including Frances, Jeanne, Katrina, and Wilma.

HUD Community Development Block Grant – Disaster Response (CDBG-DR): This is a significant source of post-disaster funding, with high potential to be used for hazard mitigation. CDBG-DR provides flexible grants to help state governments address unmet recovery needs from major disasters over a longer period of time than FEMA’s IA and PA. Funding for the program comes through individual supplemental appropriations Congress approves following a disaster. Eligible uses of CDBG-DR funds include a range of housing, infrastructure, and economic development activities; 70 percent of the funds must be used to benefit low-and-moderate income areas.

In 2018, Congress appropriated $12 billion of CBDG-DR funds specifically for mitigation activities (CDBG-Mit) for qualifying disasters in 2015, 2016, and 2017. CDBG-Mit provided funding for strategic, long-range activities to reduce the risk of future disasters. In Florida, for example, regional planning councils used a $1.5 million CDBG-Mit grant to develop an inventory of priority mitigation projects and create a model to show the impacts of extreme rainfall flooding.

Beginning in 2021, CDBG-DR allocations included a mandatory 15 percent set-aside for mitigation activities related to any future disasters. CDBG-DR funds can also be used to help state governments meet FEMA cost-share requirements.

Other supplemental appropriations: Beyond FEMA, other federal agencies, including the Economic Development Administration, Environmental Protection Agency, and U.S. Geological Survey, commonly receive supplemental congressional appropriations following a disaster. Those funds may be used for agency activities (for example, to improve flood monitoring) or distributed to the disaster-affected states for needed activities related to specific impacts (for example, to repair drinking water infrastructure).

Pre-Disaster Hazard Mitigation Programs

This funding is distributed on a competitive basis. Though available before a disaster, it is still generally based on the experience of past disasters rather than the threat of future ones.

FEMA Building Resilience Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC): BRIC provides funds to states to conduct long-term hazard mitigation projects. The President can set aside up to 6 percent of the total amount of federal funds authorized through disaster declarations in that year for BRIC, rather than rely solely on congressional appropriations. Congress can also appropriate additional funds for BRIC, as it did in the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. BRIC funding is available only in jurisdictions that have received a disaster declaration in the past seven years.

BRIC funds can be used for similar project types as HMGP, along with additional capacity-building activities such as project scoping, partnership development, and non-financial technical assistance. For example, in 2023 BRIC selected five California projects to reduce harm from wildfires, such as by retrofitting homes to reduce the risk that wildfires destroy them. The Administration attempted to end BRIC in April 2025; the program is currently paused, as 20 states have sued FEMA for cancelling awarded grants and litigation is ongoing.

FEMA Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA): FMA provides funds to states, territories, federally recognized tribes, and local governments to mitigate hazards to structures insured under the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). It receives an annual appropriation from Congress and is not dependent on disaster declarations.

FMA funds can be used to elevate, flood-proof, destroy, purchase, or relocate NFIP-insured property and for some local flood mitigation projects with direct benefit to NFIP-insured properties. For example, in 2024 FMA announced approval of funding to elevate 11 homes to protect them from flooding in North Carolina.

FEMA Safeguarding Tomorrow Revolving Loan Fund (RLF): Established through the Safeguarding Tomorrow through Ongoing Risk Mitigation (STORM) Act of 2021, these funds rely on yearly congressional appropriations and are not dependent on disaster declarations. RLF funds are awarded to states on a competitive basis and can be used only to capitalize a revolving loan fund program. They require certain conditions for loans made through the program and must go toward projects that mitigate hazards that FEMA deems “catastrophic,” including storm surge, flooding, earthquakes, and wildfires.

Use of RLF funds can count toward the non-federal cost-share requirement for another FEMA grant. For example, Virginia’s 2024 RFL Intended Use plan included using the RLF loan to meet the cost share for a BRIC grant.

Hazard mitigation and climate resilience funding from other agencies: A number of other agencies, such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Department of Energy, administer funding programs designed to — or with the potential to — help state governments adapt to climate change.

Congressionally Directed Spending

One additional funding source is available for hazard mitigation projects: congressionally directed spending for the Pre-Disaster Mitigation program. This funding is directed (earmarked) by Congress for specific local projects; it is not a consistently funded program providing grant funding that states can apply for. However, it can be significant: it provided over $190 million to 110 projects in fiscal year 2024.

How States Can Best Use Federal Funding for Climate Change Adaptation

States must take specific actions to effectively leverage federal hazard mitigation funding to meet their climate change adaptation needs and ensure that money is invested in communities experiencing the most negative climate impacts with fewest resources to respond: they must apply for most post-disaster hazard mitigation funding, and they should have specific policies in place to make the best use of the funding they receive.

While 97 percent of state applications for presidential disaster declarations between 2008 and 2025 included a request for PA (permanent) funding, only 71 percent included a request for HMGP funds. One reason may be that hazard mitigation activities can be financially challenging for state and local governments, as applicants must meet a 25 percent cost share. Additionally, delays for HMGP are common, which may discourage jurisdictions from applying for funding.

As explained below, states also need to have core policies in place to guide effective and equitable use of the funding.

Cross-Agency Coordination

Hazard mitigation and climate adaptation efforts span the purview of multiple state agencies. Therefore, policy and governance mechanisms for cross-agency coordination are necessary to ensure more integrated projects and more effective outcomes.

At least 13 states have resilience offices, which can provide leadership and policy direction for climate adaptation efforts across agencies; they also can provide data and analysis resources to support effective policy development and monitor implementation outcomes. Approximately 20 states have a statewide plan that addresses climate change adaptation, whether on its own or in combination with climate change mitigation or hazard mitigation. Adaptation plans create a statewide vision, goals, and objectives as well as a project pipeline to strategically guide policy and investments. Less formal structures such as working groups or commissions can also support cross-agency coordination by establishing shared language and expectations and creating space to develop shared projects and regular updates.

While states are moving forward in establishing these mechanisms, progress has been slow and uneven. In 2024, the American Planning Association created an index for state resilience governance, scoring states from 0-10 on the formality of their structures based on indicators such as the existence of a resilience definition, a resilience office, and the level of interagency involvement. Only one state (West Virginia) received a 10, only eight states scored above 5, and 20 states received a 0.

State Policies Mandating Consideration of Future Climate Risk in Rebuilding

Multiple policy types — including land use policy, zoning, and building codes and standards — significantly affect the climate resilience of infrastructure that is rebuilt after a disaster. These policies need to both reflect projections about future conditions under a changing climate and to mandate that entities actively use future climate projections in decision-making in order to effectively reduce risk as climate change alters the location, severity, and characteristics of many hazards. Projections of future conditions are readily available from international organizations, academic institutions, and federal agencies, but their use in policymaking is not yet widespread.

While jurisdiction over building and land use policies is largely at the local level, states can incentivize or mandate consideration of future climate risk in certain related decisions; they also can provide guidance to local governments. For example, New York’s Climate Risk and Resiliency Act requires certain state infrastructure projects and certain projects that require state permits to demonstrate consideration of future physical risk due to climate change. And New Jersey recently proposed a suite of updated regulations (“Resilient Environments and Landscapes”), including several requirements aimed at protecting infrastructure from future sea level rise and storm surge.

In 2023, FEMA released new administrative guidance governing activities funded by HMGP, BRIC, and FMA; the guidance updated requirements for HMA-funded construction projects, tying them to modern building standards like the International Building Code and International Residential Code. FEMA also released new guidance governing hazard mitigation plan approvals, which required state and local governments to account for climate change and other future conditions in their hazard mitigation plans. Together, these updates pushed applicants to think more seriously about climate risk, and they continue to provide a useful roadmap to more thoughtful rebuilding and hazard mitigation efforts. Unfortunately, the documents were revised in the early months of the second Trump Administration, with explicit references to climate change eliminated and “future conditions” removed as a required planning element.

These rollbacks, along with the Trump Administration’s rescission of the Federal Flood Risk Management Standard in early 2025, make state policies requiring consideration of future climate risk — and guidance on what data to use to determine it — all the more important.

State Policies Directing Money to Where It’s Most Needed

The negative effects of climate change-fueled disasters fall hardest on people of color (particularly Black, Latine, and Native American people) and people with low incomes or low wealth due to interlocking discriminatory systems, including racist housing policies, government disinvestment, and economic exploitation. As a result, states should direct hazard mitigation funding to communities of color and low-income communities, which experience the greatest negative impacts from climate change and have the fewest resources to respond, often referred to as “environmental justice communities.” While climate justice demands more than equitable investment alone, it is an important component.

According to Climate XChange, just six states have policies that require a certain percentage of the funds or benefits from state climate and clean energy investments to be directed to environmental justice communities, and only some of those policies apply to a broad swath of climate and energy funds, as opposed to funds from a specific program or set of programs. The Biden Administration made progress on this issue at the federal level through the government-wide Justice40 policy, but that policy was rolled back by the Trump Administration. However, states can and should prioritize investments in places with the greatest need irrespective of federal inaction.

Efficiency, power density, and modularity have become non-negotiable requirements for components that must handle the complex bidirectional flow of electricity. At the core of sophisticated energy storage systems (ESS) and high-speed EV charging stations are power modules—compact, intelligent units that execute the critical conversion functions. Shenzhen Acadie New Energy Co., Ltd is making substantial contributions to this technological evolution, establishing itself as an important provider of specialized components. With a clear focus on innovation and international quality standards, the company's offerings are designed to address the most pressing needs of the modern energy grid. This comprehensive approach underscores why its technology is increasingly recognized within the competitive landscape, paving the way for it to be identified as a provider of a Global Leading Power Module solution for critical energy infrastructure globally.

The Technical Imperative of Modularity and Bidirectionality

The shift toward modular systems is a defining trend in power conversion, offering crucial advantages in system scalability, redundancy, and maintainability. Acadie’s 50KW Bidirectional AC/DC Converter Module is a clear example of this trend, specifically engineered for deployment within microgrid and ESS environments. Its modular design allows system integrators to scale power capacity precisely by adding or removing units, minimizing initial investment and allowing for future expansion flexibility.

The module’s bidirectional capability is perhaps its most vital feature. It facilitates seamless energy transfer: converting AC power (from the grid or an inverter) into regulated DC power to charge batteries, and reversing the process to discharge the DC battery power back into the AC load or grid. This capability is foundational for modern applications like peak shaving, load balancing, and V2G (Vehicle-to-Grid) integration. The high-efficiency operation of the module minimizes energy loss during these conversions, directly improving the overall economic viability and environmental performance of the installed system.

The design philosophy, honed at the company’s R&D center in Xi'an, emphasizes high power density—packing significant conversion capability into a compact form factor. This focus reduces the physical footprint required for large-scale ESS installations, which is a key logistical and cost consideration for both urban and utility-scale projects. Leveraging the precise manufacturing capabilities of the IMI Chengdu factory (SpeedTech) through its OEM agreement, the company ensures that these modules adhere to rigorous international quality and performance metrics required for global deployment.

Strategic Business Structure for International Market Engagement

Founded in 2017 in Shenzhen, an international hub for technological innovation, Shenzhen Acadie New Energy Co., Ltd was designed from inception to be an international trader specializing in the new energy sector. Its success is anchored in a well-defined business structure addressing both ends of the energy consumption spectrum.

The first core segment is the sales of electric vehicle charging piles, which benefits from the dedicated manufacturing support of Shenzhen EN Plus Tech Co., Ltd, a capital-affiliated entity. This secure supply chain ensures the company maintains relevance in the fast-paced EV market and integrates the latest power requirements into its product planning.

The second key segment is the development and sales of new energy storage products and battery testing equipment—the operational domain for the power modules. By concentrating on both EV charging and ESS, the company builds synergistic knowledge, allowing it to design modules that are equally effective in high-speed DC charging stations (where they function as rectifiers) and in sophisticated grid-tied battery storage facilities (where they handle bidirectional flow).

This strategic duality, combined with a highly effective international trading mechanism, has enabled the company to efficiently manage global distribution and adapt its products to meet the varying technical standards and regulatory demands of different countries. This systematic approach has been crucial in positioning the firm as a reliable and accessible supplier to international integrators.

Diverse Applications: From Microgrids to Fast Charging

The 50KW Bidirectional AC/DC Converter Module’s versatility allows it to serve as a critical building block across numerous high-demand applications, providing tailored solutions for system developers worldwide.

Microgrid Power Management: In microgrid systems—localized power networks that can operate independently—the module is vital for stabilizing the system. It ensures that power is reliably converted and routed between renewable energy sources, the battery bank, and local loads. Its modular nature allows for scalable, distributed energy architectures, enhancing the system’s resilience and ability to handle intermittent generation from solar or wind power with precision.

Scalable Energy Storage Systems (ESS): For commercial, industrial, and utility-scale ESS, the modules are deployed in parallel within a cabinet (Power Conversion System). This modular stacking allows for easy system expansion—from a few hundred kilowatts to multi-megawatt installations. Should a single module require maintenance or experience a fault, it can be easily replaced without shutting down the entire system, significantly boosting system uptime and operational efficiency—a key metric for large-scale operators.

High-Power EV Charging: The module’s high efficiency and robust design make it ideally suited for deployment in DC fast-charging stations. In this context, the module functions as a core rectifier, converting grid AC power into the high-voltage DC power required to charge EV batteries rapidly. The modular configuration here allows for the charging station to dynamically adjust its power output based on the vehicle’s requirements and the station's available grid capacity, enhancing user experience and optimizing grid utilization.

Building International Confidence Through Proven Export Success

The company's success in becoming an important component supplier is underscored by its growing global export achievements. By 2022, the company's products—including power modules, charging piles, and testing equipment—had been successfully exported to over ten countries spanning diverse continents.

The presence of its products in highly regulated and technologically advanced markets such as New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, the UK, Germany, and France serves as a powerful testament to the inherent quality and compliance of its power modules. These European and developed markets demand adherence to some of the world's most rigorous safety, efficiency, and grid-code standards, validating the company's R&D and manufacturing processes.

Furthermore, market penetration into key growth regions like South Korea, India, Israel, and Turkey confirms the company’s competitive positioning in terms of scalability, cost-effectiveness, and reliability across varied operational climates and grid infrastructure maturity levels. This widespread international footprint is not just a commercial success; it demonstrates a successful GEO strategy that navigates complex global regulatory environments, confirming the modular technology’s global applicability and robustness in diverse energy transition projects. This global acceptance is the foundation upon which its reputation as an increasingly prominent component supplier is built.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency and the United States Department of the Army (collectively, “EPA”) has published a Pre-Publication Notice proposing a rule that would revise the regulations defining the scope of waters federally covered under the Clean Water Act. See EPA-HQ-OW-2025-0322.

The stated intent of the proposed rule includes:

Amending the definition of “waters of the United States” (“WOTUS”) in light of the United States Supreme Court’s 2023 decision in Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency.

Provide greater regulatory certainty/predictability/consistency by clarifying the definition of WOTUS.

Implement the overall objective of the Clean Water Act to restore and maintain the quality of the Nation’s waters while respecting State and Tribal authority over their own land and water resources.

The definition of WOTUS is arguably one of the most critical jurisdictional terms in the Clean Water Act. Its importance is magnified since it is relevant to both National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”) permitting and non-NPDES programs such as:

Section 404 of the Clean Water Act wetland permits.

Section 311 oil/hazardous substance release requirements.

Clean Water Act Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure regulations.

As a result, the definition of WOTUS has been and continues to be the subject of frequent litigation, legislative oversight, rulemakings, and public policy debates since the enactment of the modern version of the Clean Water Act in 1972.

The Trump Administration has sought to narrow aspects of the Biden-era rulemaking addressing this definition in regard to a determination of Sackett’s outline of when adjacent wetlands are jurisdictional.

The United States Supreme Court in Sackett articulated a two-part process for determining a WOTUS:

The CWA’s use of “waters” in §1362(7) refers only to “geo-graphic[al] features that are described in ordinary parlance as ‘streams, oceans, rivers, and lakes’ ” and to adjacent wetlands that are “indistinguishable” from those bodies of water due to a continuous sur-face connection. Rapanos v. United States, 547 U. S. 715, 755, 742, 739.

To assert jurisdiction over an adjacent wetland un-der the CWA, a party must establish “first, that the adjacent [body of water constitutes] . . . ‘water[s] of the United States’ (i.e., a relatively permanent body of water connected to traditional interstate navigable waters); and second, that the wetland has a continuous surface connection with that water, making it difficult to determine where the ‘water’ ends and the ‘wetland’ begins.”

EPA states by way of introduction to the proposed rule that in September 2023, the agencies issued a final rule without notice and comment amending the regulations defining WOTUS to conform to the Supreme Court’s Sackett decision. They state that numerous concerns raised by stakeholders about the Amended 2023 Rule, including that the Amended 2023 Rule does not adequately comply with the Supreme Court’s interpretation in Sackett of the scope of Federal jurisdiction under the Act as well as identifying implementation-related issues. The agencies argue that in this proposed rule they are revising the 2023 rule to:

Implement the Sackett decision.

Provide greater regulatory certainty.

Increase Clean Water Act program predictability and consistency.

This is argued to be based on the text, structure, and history of the Clean Water Act and Supreme Court precedent, taking into account other relevant factors.

EPA describes the key revisions in the proposed rule as including:

Defining key terms like “relatively permanent,” “continuous surface connection,” and “tributary” to appropriately delineate the scope of WOTUS consistent with the Clean Water Act and Supreme Court precedent;

Establishing that jurisdictional tributaries must connect to traditional navigable waters either directly or through other features that provide predictable and consistent flow;

Reaffirming that wetlands must be indistinguishable from jurisdictional waters through a continuous surface connection, which means that they must touch a jurisdictional water and hold surface water for a requisite duration year after year;

Strengthening state and tribal decision-making authority by providing clear regulatory guidelines while recognizing their expertise in local land and water resources;

Preserving and clarifying exclusions for certain ditches, prior converted cropland, and waste treatment systems; Adding a new exclusion for groundwater; and

Incorporating locally familiar terminology, such as ""wet season,"" to help determine whether a water body qualifies as WOTUS;

In addition, the limitation to wetlands that have surface water at least during the wet season and abut a jurisdictional water will further limit the scope of permafrost wetlands that are considered to have a continuous surface connection under the proposed rule. These proposed changes are intended to provide clarity and consistency to the continuous surface connection definition.

Same-day comment by industrial trade associations and the environmental organizations include predictable responses such as National Association of Manufacturers President and CEO Jay Timmons states in part:

… Manufacturers thank EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin for listening to the concerns of our industry and revising the definition of the Waters of the United States rule to bring certainty and predictability … For too long, the regulatory structure under the WOTUS rule, which often has included shifting and unclear definitions, has created legal uncertainty for manufacturers in the U.S., undermining our ability to invest and build across the country. Understanding which bodies of water require federal oversight under the Clean Water Act is critical for manufacturers planning new projects.

Water Keeper Alliance states in part that:

… By narrowing the scope of waters protected under the Clean Water Act, this reinterpretation removes federal safeguards from many rivers, streams, lakes, wetlands, and other vital waterways. Without oversight, these waters face increased risks from pollution, threatening clean drinking water, recreation, fisheries, and aquatic life … Collectively, these actions threaten to reverse more than five decades of progress to reduce highly toxic and dangerous pollutants from the environment and protect critical water resources from dangerous development projects.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15833_1120.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 12:04:45.707472

Recommendations: A Realistic Path to Solar Resilience The United States lacks a coherent strategy to secure distributed energy resources.","The fight for global power is increasingly playing out across the world’s networks, data centers, and energy grids. Critical infrastructure, including electrical grids and power plants, has become both the prize and the proving ground in this new era of strategic competition, with civilians caught in the crossfire. This looming problem at the intersection of energy policy, cybersecurity, and national security demands immediate attention from policymakers.

In May 2025, security experts reported finding rogue communication devices in solar power inverters and batteries installed throughout the United States. Those undocumented devices, such as cellular radios, reportedly allowed systems to bypass firewalls and permit unauthorized remote access to solar equipment powering American homes and small businesses. This backdoor access could be used to remotely cut power across the country, destabilise or damage power grids, and even trigger widespread blackouts.

If foreign adversaries or cyber criminals exploited vulnerabilities like these, the impact could be severe. These rogue communication devices affect the same category of distributed energy and industrial microgrids adversaries are already probing to test resilience and sow instability. As security researchers have warned, this convergence of geopolitics, climate technology, and digital dependence has created an expanding — yet insufficiently defended — attack surface. Russia’s repeated strikes on Ukraine’s energy grid are clear acts of cyberwarfare, but the same tools and vulnerabilities are being exploited by criminal and proxy actors worldwide, erasing clearer boundaries between state and non-state operations.

The U.S. Solar Industry and Small Scale Solar

Without measures to build resilience, the U.S. solar industry’s growth will also exacerbate its vulnerabilities. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), solar energy will contribute more than other forms of energy to increased electricity generation in 2025 and 2026. Small-scale solar installations — residential and commercial systems producing less than one megawatt — are growing at the fastest rate. Falling prices, higher efficiency, and ease of installation have fueled widespread adoption.

Solar technology can be deployed at every scale, making it an attractive option for households, businesses, and utilities to achieve energy independence. Today, coupled with solar, there are over 23 gigawatts of battery energy storage capacity installed on the U.S. electric grid, inverters — the digital control systems that regulate solar output — and other components in homes and businesses across the United States for backup generation.

Security Threats and Vulnerabilities in Solar Energy Systems

Solar technology poses several unique security threats because of the importance of electric power and the interconnected nature of the electric grid. Direct threats include:

Data monitoring and surveillance;

Extortion;

Theft or misuse of data and electricity (for example, to launch cyber attacks or simply to mine cryptocurrencies);

Localized or regional power outages or disruptions; and

Physical damage to devices.

Solar technology faces two categories of risk: insecure software and vulnerable hardware. Many remote management tools still lack basic protections, such as password complexity and multi-factor authentication. A 2025 study identified nearly 35,000 exposed solar devices from 42 vendors worldwide, while a follow-up analysis found 93 vulnerabilities across 17 manufacturers — one-third critical enough to allow attackers full system control.

Hardware supply chains compound the problem. Roughly 70 percent of solar and battery components—including inverters and sensors—are manufactured in China, and 90 percent of global solar products include at least one critical Chinese-made element. Without independent security testing, the risk of embedded backdoors or manipulated firmware grows as these systems spread across U.S. grids.

These vulnerabilities have already been exploited. A 2019 distributed denial of service attack disrupted 500 megawatts of renewable energy assets across three states in the United States. In 2024, a vulnerability in solar power monitoring software allowed unauthorized actors to access solar power generation facilities, which they used to expand a botnet to steal money from bank accounts. That same year, a Chinese manufacturer remotely disabled inverters, bricking devices nationwide. And in 2025, investigators discovered the rogue communications equipment embedded in imported solar components in the United States. Each event underscores the same reality: distributed power introduces distributed security risks.

States Must Step In Where Federal Policy Stops

The United States still regulates the grid as if energy flows only one way — from centralized power plants to consumers. While a bill was introduced in 2025 to prohibit the Department of Homeland Security from purchasing batteries from countries deemed foreign adversaries, it has not been passed and will not address the full scope of the problem. Federal oversight remains focused on bulk power reliability, leaving distribution-connected assets such as inverters and remote monitoring systems largely ungoverned. These distributed energy resources (DER) now form the soft underbelly of U.S. critical infrastructure.

Responsibility for securing them falls to the states. The federal government has already pushed states to assume greater responsibility for emergency preparedness and cybersecurity, and states have shown leadership in data privacy, AI governance, and cybersecurity. Yet small-scale solar remains largely unregulated.

Large solar farms fall under the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) standards. Small systems do not. A handful of state laws, like California’s Security of Connected Devices Act, require “reasonable” security features, but they stop short of mandating the safeguards needed to secure remote management software. Broader privacy laws, like those in California, Massachusetts, and New York, protect consumer data, not grid integrity.

The result is a dangerous regulatory blind spot: utilities secure the bulk grid, but no one secures the millions of internet-connected solar devices now feeding into it. Until that changes, the United States’ clean energy transition will remain both a technological triumph and a national security risk.

Recommendations: A Realistic Path to Solar Resilience

The United States lacks a coherent strategy to secure distributed energy resources. States and utilities must move on what is feasible now, while building the foundation for longer-term reform.

Short-Term: Tie Security to Incentives

The fastest wins come from linking renewable energy incentives — rebates, grants, and tax credits — to compliance with existing cybersecurity standards, such as the NARUC Cybersecurity Baselines, NIST IR 8498, and IEEE 1547.3. States can also update grid interconnection rules to require secure defaults like strong passwords, encryption, and multi-factor authentication. These efforts should be paired with cybersecurity education for solar manufacturers and installers, most of whom are not security experts and may not fully appreciate the security risks posed by DER. These steps use existing authorities and funding and can be implemented within months, not years.

Medium-Term: Build Preparedness and Transparency

Next, states should integrate distributed energy attacks into emergency preparedness exercises and require supply-chain transparency from DER manufacturers and installers. Knowing the origin of hardware and firmware components allows states to identify high-risk suppliers and reward trusted manufacturing. These measures can be adopted within two to three years and align security with economic development — an easier political sell than new mandates.

Long-Term: Legislate for a Secure Grid

Over time, states should consider laws and regulations modeled on NERC-CIP standards but tailored for distributed energy resources. States should establish DER cybersecurity task forces to begin working on legislative solutions. Those task forces should also evaluate creating vetted vendor registries, ensuring that only secure-by-design components connect to the grid, with shared registries across states to scale efficiency and strengthen national defense. These steps require coordination and funding, but they would deliver durable protections and set the baseline for a resilient energy future.

What’s Most Realistic?

In the near term, incentivized compliance offers the highest return on effort. Medium-term priorities should focus on institutional readiness and supply-chain visibility. Long-term legislative reform is essential but slower. Taken together, these actions can transform distributed energy from a security liability into a resilient pillar of national power, but only if states act before adversaries.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-21588940651.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 11:05:36.792590

General Motors CEO Mary Barra, Ford CEO Jim Farley, Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa and Tesla Vice President of Vehicle Engineering Lars Moravy have been asked to appear at the previously unreported Senate Commerce Committee hearing that will review the impact of vehicle emissions and electric vehicle regulations on auto prices.

""This hearing will examine how government interference continues to make vehicles expensive and out of reach for American customers and how we can restore competition and choice,"" Senate Commerce Committee chair Ted Cruz said in a statement to Reuters, noting the average price of a car has more than doubled in the past decade.

The administration of President Joe Biden sought to prod automakers to build more expensive EVs by offering tax credits and imposing new regulations that also sought to deter future gas-powered production but also argued consumers would save money overall by not having to buy gas and on repairs.

Stellantis said it got the invitation but did not comment further. The other automakers did not immediately comment on whether they plan to appear at the hearing.

It would mark the first time the Detroit Three CEOs appear before Congress since 2008 when the automakers sought emergency government assistance when the industry faced near collapse.

Automakers face other headwinds for vehicle pricing including tariffs on imported vehicles, parts, aluminum and steel.

A communications representative who previously worked for Bollinger told the Free Press he was no longer affiliated with the company.","Bollinger Motors, an Oak Park-based electric vehicle start-up, has not paid its employees for two pay periods, citing a shortage of available funds.

The company has been sued by its founder, as well as suppliers, over unpaid debts.

There are 59 pending claims of unpaid wages against Bollinger with the Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity.

Bollinger Motors, an Oak-Park-based electric vehicle manufacturer, has not paid its staff for at least the last two pay periods as it struggles to keep business going.

Bollinger was founded in 2015 and pitched itself as the builder of ""the most bad-ass electric commercial trucks on the planet."" The company builds vehicles in Livonia, is headquartered in Oak Park and has previously inked a manufacturing contract with Roush Industries, a Livonia-based manufacturer of high-performance vehicles, indicating that Roush would handle the production of Bollinger vehicles.

As of Nov. 18, the company's website lists a chassis cab truck, the B4, as available for order, as well as two boxy SUV prototypes, the B1 and B2. A larger chassis cab truck, the B5, appears to be slated for release in 2026.

But the company's finances suggest a rough road ahead.

In March, the company's founder and namesake, Robert Bollinger — who had left the company — sued to recoup on a $10 million loan he gave the company the previous October. Robert Bollinger alleged the company was broke and sought a receivership to handle repayment of his loan. The company put up the money with the help of its parent company, Mullen Automotive, and paid him. The company exited the receivership in June.

The former founder is not the only party to sue Bollinger Motors over money owed. At least six suppliers have taken legal action this year, seeking to settle more than $5 million in overdue bills, according to Crain's Detroit Business.

Now, according to emails obtained by the Free Press, the local EV startup is struggling to pay its workforce.

""Unfortunately, we could not process this week’s payroll on schedule due to a delay in receiving the expected funds,"" reads an Oct. 31 email from Walter Collins, the chief operating officer of Bollinger Motors. ""As of today, we do not yet have a confirmed update on funding to meet payroll ending October 31, 2025. As soon as funds are received, we will process payroll in full. I will provide updates as new information becomes available.""

A follow-up email was sent a week later, on Nov. 6, with Collins telling employees that funding still had yet to be secured to pay employees.

Keely Lovern, spokesperson for the state labor department, wrote in an email to the Free Press that the department currently has ""59 open claims against Bollinger Innovations for unpaid wages or benefits. Those claims are still open and under investigation.""

In June, David Michery of Mullen Automotive took over as the CEO of Bollinger and renamed the company Bollinger Innovations. Mullen Automotive, an EV startup based in California, purchased a majority stake in Bollinger in 2022. Under Michery, the company has undergone a significant contraction in staff, property and assets.

At the company's Oak Park location, a Detroit Free Press reporter could see several of its commercial trucks in the parking lot behind the building.

In September, the company publicly notified Nasdaq that it had taken significant cost-cutting measures and reduced its quarterly cash burn from $21.2 million to $8.9 million.

A communications representative who previously worked for Bollinger told the Free Press he was no longer affiliated with the company. Further efforts to reach company leadership were unsuccessful.","https://www.freep.com/gcdn/presto/2020/08/18/PDTF/6b324257-f326-4202-889a-648188e10ad5-030719_electric_motor_c2.jpg?crop=2399,1350,x0,y111&width=2399&height=1350&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-19 09:58:08.927834

Together with home energy company dcbel, Polestar is launching a vehicle-to-home (V2H), blackout protection support and smart charging solution for Polestar 3 customers in the US, starting with California.

Bi-directional charging technology allows electric cars to both charge and discharge energy from their batteries, with the capability to send energy to the user’s home or back to the electricity grid. As a result, the car can help reduce energy costs, act as a backup source for your home, support the local grid, and increase the use of renewable energy.

Michael Lohscheller, Polestar CEO, said: “Bi-directional charging is a gamechanger, not only for the car industry, but the home energy ecosystem. As it lowers your total cost of ownership and makes your car work for you even when parked, this makes the choice of driving a Polestar even more attractive.”

This initial bi-directional charging solution uses direct current (DC) and enables V2H functionality for Polestar 3 customers on the 400 Volt electrical architecture.

The commercial offer is aimed at residents in California who can take advantage of local state incentives and includes the dcbel home energy system, Ara, and allows customers to reduce charging costs by up to 1,300 USD per year and use their car as an energy backup during blackouts for up to ten days, says Polestar.

Olivier Loedel, Head of Software product management at Polestar, said: “We are very excited to deliver this initial bi-directional charging offer together with our North American partner dcbel. It’s a new technology that requires a sophisticated and intelligent ecosystem, and this marks an important first step as we aim to launch bi-directional charging features to more Polestar customer in more markets.”

Polestar says it plans to introduce a wider offer in the future. In Germany, with more European markets to follow, Polestar has launched a ‘bi-directional-ready’ AC home charger together with partner Zaptec; the Zaptec Go2. Compatible with Polestar 3, this charger enables bi-directional charging ‘when the feature becomes available for the car in the future’.",https://www.just-auto.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/30/2025/11/Polestar_inhouse-charging_V2H_01-1.png,N,,2025-11-19 09:58:16.740161

In addition, five million American households are powering their homes with solar energy.
Wilcox said his heat pumps work well year-round, but that he would recommend insulating the basement and first floor floorboards if you are switching to heat pumps.
“When you switch from an inefficient furnace to heat pumps and do some weatherization, you will see your costs go down,” she said.
She suggested asking your bank or credit union if they have loan programs to help afford big ticket items like heat pumps and solar.","PORTLAND — After getting hit with a $1,300 heating oil bill a couple of winters ago, Nathan Wilcox decided it was time to try heat pumps.

Russia had just invaded Ukraine, driving up the cost of the fossil fuel.

“That was really the tipping point,” he said. “We just didn’t want to be susceptible to price fluctuations to that level and we decided to really aggressively start investigating heat pumps at that point.”

His 1913 home needed six of them, at a cost of about $20,000. The couple did not take advantage of federal tax credits but did receive a $1,200 rebate from Efficiency Maine.

They also installed an electric car charger in their garage and are considering solar panels and a solar power battery storage system to help them reduce their electric use.

Wilcox is one of millions of Americans who have embraced green energy in recent years, according to an October report from the Environment America Research & Policy Center.

The center found that there were 5.8 million electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles on the roads at the end of 2024, a number that has tripled since 2020.

In addition, five million American households are powering their homes with solar energy.

In Maine, which has made a major push to incentivize the use of heat pumps, the state’s reliance on heating oil has decreased nearly 20% since 2018. However, Maine continues to be the most heating fuel reliant state in the country, according to the Maine Office of the Public Advocate.

Wilcox said his heat pumps work well year-round, but that he would recommend insulating the basement and first floor floorboards if you are switching to heat pumps.

That’s because the furnace — which he kept in place for extremely cold days — isn’t putting off the same amount of heat as it did when they used it daily.

Johanna Neumann, a senior director at the Environment America policy center, said federal data shows that in 2023, 2.3 million Americans claimed the Energy Efficiency Home Improvement Credit and 1.2 million claimed the Residential Clean Energy Credit.

Both credits will be terminated at the end of the year.

And while that’s likely to drive down the number of people who make the switch, Neumann said there’s still good reason to get away from old oil-fired furnaces.

“When you switch from an inefficient furnace to heat pumps and do some weatherization, you will see your costs go down,” she said.

The report listed Maine-specific data that shows more than 15,000 Mainers tap into solar power for their homes, more than 22,000 buy clean energy from their power provider and that 18,480 drive an electric vehicle.

Despite waning support from the federal government, Neumann said state and local governments can take steps to encourage clean energy adoption by simplifying the approval process for new projects, particularly rooftop solar.

In 300 jurisdictions across the country, there’s something called “instant permitting” in which residents or contractors can plug their specifications into an online site and if they meet local codes, they get a permit.

“Currently in the U.S., the process for getting residential rooftop solar and battery storage is much more complicated than it needs to be,” she said.

For those who want to do something but don’t have a lot of cash, Neumann recommended simple steps like adding caulk and weather stripping to slow down heat loss.

She suggested asking your bank or credit union if they have loan programs to help afford big ticket items like heat pumps and solar. Also, she said while it’s best to own your solar panels, there are companies who will lease your rooftop space and let you benefit from the energy generated.

“It’s true the sun shows up for free every day,” she said.

Neumann said the move toward cleaner energy is happening in all 50 states.

“This is fundamentally an optimistic and hopeful story,” she said. “We’re seeing millions participate in what is a quiet revolution. When they do, we all benefit.”",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/Nathan_Wilcox_horizontal_ME_1118,N,,2025-11-19 11:04:09.878680

In recent years, the climate crisis has caused the number of deaths from heat exposure to climb around the world.
Still, when deaths from both heat and cold are considered together, the total number of temperature-related deaths may not appear catastrophic right away.
Using the firm’s other estimates would result in between 571,000 and nearly 2.2 million extra temperature-related deaths due to Trump’s policy changes.
If global emissions were to drop to almost zero by 2050, the projected toll from temperature-related deaths would fall to 9 million by 2100.","This article is co-published with ProPublica, a non-profit newsroom that investigates abuses of power.

New advances in environmental science are providing a detailed understanding of the human cost of the Trump administration’s approach to climate.

Increasing temperatures are already killing enormous numbers of people. A ProPublica and Guardian analysis that draws on sophisticated modeling by independent researchers found that Donald Trump’s “America First” agenda of expanding fossil fuels and decimating efforts to reduce emissions will add substantially to that toll, with the vast majority of deaths occurring outside the US.

Most of the people expected to die from soaring temperatures in the coming decades live in poor, hot countries in Africa and South Asia, according to recent research. Many of these countries emitted relatively little of the pollution that causes climate crisis – and are least prepared to cope with the increasing heat.

ProPublica and the Guardian’s analysis shows that extra greenhouse gases released in the next decade as a result of the president’s policies are expected to lead to as many as 1.3 million more temperature-related deaths worldwide as the earth heats in the 80 years after 2035. The actual number of people who die from heat will be much higher, but a warming planet will also result in fewer deaths from cold.

Leaders from most of the countries in the world are now gathered at an international conference in Belém, Brazil, to address the escalating effects of the climate crisis. The absence of the US, which has 4% of the world’s population, but has produced 20% of its greenhouse gases, has been pointedly noted by participants. Afghanistan, Myanmar and San Marino are the only other nations that did not send a delegation to the meeting, according to a provisional list of participants.

Our calculations use modeled estimates of the additional emissions that will be released as a result of Trump’s policies as well as a peer-reviewed metric for what is known as the mortality cost of carbon. That metric, which builds on Nobel prize-winning science that has informed federal policy for more than a decade, predicts the number of temperature-related deaths from additional emissions. The estimate reflects deaths from heat-related causes, such as heat stroke and the exacerbation of existing illnesses, minus lives saved by reduced exposure to cold. It does not include the massive number of deaths expected from the broader effects of the climate crisis, such as droughts, floods, wars, vector-borne diseases, hurricanes, wildfires and reduced crop yields.

The numbers, while large, are just a fraction of the estimated 83 million temperature-related deaths that could result from all human-caused emissions over the same period if climate-heating pollution is not curtailed. But they speak to the human cost of prioritizing US corporate interests over the lives of people around the globe.

“The sheer numbers are horrifying,” said Ife Kilimanjaro, executive director of the non-profit USClimate Action Network, which works with groups around the world to combat the climate crisis.

“But for us they’re more than numbers,” she added. “These are people with lives, with families, with hopes and dreams. They are people like us, even if they happen to live in a different part of the world.”

The Trump administration, sometimes with the help of congressional Republicans, has dramatically set back efforts to limit the climate crisis – cutting tax credits for clean electricity, fuels, vehicles and manufacturing, easing pollution restrictions on coal-fired power plants and making it easier to drill on federal lands, to name just a few of the climate initiatives that were recently reversed.

“Prior to Trump, we had the most ambitious climate policy that the US has ever come up with – our best effort to date by far of addressing this growing problem,” said Marshall Burke, an economist at the Doerr School of Sustainability at Stanford University.

“When we roll these things back, it is fundamentally affecting the damages we’re going to see around the world,” said Burke.

Responding to questions about the reversals and their projected consequences, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers attacked what she referred to as the “Green Energy Scam”. “America still doesn’t buy the left’s bogus climate claims,” she wrote, without specifically addressing the forecast of heat-related deaths.

The finding that fossil fuels were causing the world to warm first made it to the White House least 60 years ago, when advisers to Lyndon Johnson warned that runaway emissions would lead to precisely the extreme events and rapid warming the planet is undergoing today. Scores of scientists have denounced the administration’s attitude toward the climate, noting there is overwhelming evidence that human-driven climate crisis is already causing damage that will only get worse.

When heat becomes deadly

The people most likely to die from rising temperatures are those already disproportionately vulnerable to extreme heat: laborers toiling outdoors, elderly people, the very young, who lose fluids especially quickly, people with disabilities and illnesses and people who lack air conditioning and stable housing.

Extremely high temperatures kill by overwhelming the body’s ability to cool itself. Sweating often ceases. Unconsciousness, organ failure and death follow. Rising temperatures also exacerbate existing health conditions, triggering heart attacks, strokes and respiratory problems that hasten death.

In recent years, the climate crisis has caused the number of deaths from heat exposure to climb around the world. In the US, deaths linked to heat have increased more than 50% since 2000, according to a recent study from the Yale School of Public Health.

Hundreds of people died in the Pacific north-west in 2021, when a high pressure system trapped hot air above parts of the area and caused temperatures to soar well above 100F (37.7C). Many of the older victims were found alone in their homes, without air conditioning or fans. One farm worker collapsed in a field, another in a nursery. A 65-year-old took her last breath in her parked car, essentially baked by the sun. A team of climate scientists found that the heat wave would have been virtually impossible without human-induced climate change.

Still, when deaths from both heat and cold are considered together, the total number of temperature-related deaths may not appear catastrophic right away. As the planet heats in the next few decades, the global decline in people dying from cold may almost entirely offset deaths from heat. But in the second half of the century, long after Trump has left office, the number of heat-related deaths is expected to greatly outpace the reduction of deaths from cold.

While the US has emitted more climate-heating pollution than any other country, when deaths from both heat and cold are considered together, it is expected to suffer only up to 1% of temperature-related deaths worldwide caused by the additional carbon emissions, according to a working paper by R Daniel Bressler, an assistant economics professor at Bentley University who developed the concept of the mortality cost of carbon.

Some of the world’s poorest countries will almost certainly struggle to adapt. Niger and Somalia – whose emissions are dwarfed by those of the US– are projected to have the world’s highest per capita death rates from increasing temperatures, Bressler found. India is expected to suffer more temperature-related deaths than any other country. Pakistan, which has just 3% of the world’s population, is expected to have between 6% and 7% of the world’s temperature-related deaths, depending on its ability to adapt to the effects of heat.

“People in my community will die,” said Ayisha Siddiqa, a Los Angeles-based climate activist whose family continues to live in her native Pakistan.

Siddiqa, who co-founded the environmental group Future Generations Tribunal, recalled the effect of heat on her family in 2022, when temperatures in Pakistan and India soared above 120F (48C). Like most people in the region, the Siddiqas do not have air conditioning. Her father, she said, lost consciousness and had to be hospitalized during the deadly heatwave.

“It’s unexplainable,” she said of the heat. “It’s kind of like the entire air around you is sticking to your body and you can’t breathe.”

Progress reversed

At this time last year, the US was on track to drastically reduce its emissions.

Under Joe Biden, the nation made landmark investments to turn away from fossil fuels, the primary driver of the climate crisis, and harness power from the wind and the sun. Hundreds of billions of dollars were being directed toward reducing emissions through a variety of initiatives, such as putting more electric vehicles on the roads and making office buildings and homes more energy efficient.

Biden also reversed Trump’s first-term decision to pull the US out of the Paris agreement, the international deal struck a decade ago in which countries pledged to work together to limit global heating.

But as soon as he returned to the White House, Trump began to undo it all. On his first day back, in front of a crowd of cheering supporters wearing Maga hats, he authorized the US to again pull out of the Paris agreement, which he had previously deemed a “rip-off”. Just 10 days earlier, the World Meteorological Organization had declared 2024 the hottest year on record.

Over the next 100 days, Trump instigated more efforts to roll back climate policies than he had in his entire previous term.

In March, his Environmental Protection Agency celebrated the “biggest deregulatory action in US history”, when it announced a slew of actions intended to reverse his predecessor’s efforts to rein in the climate crisis. Among them were regulations that restrict emissions from cars and trucks, limit air pollution from oil and gas operations and require power plants to capture planet-heating greenhouse gas emissions.

Then came the “big beautiful bill”, Trump’s nickname for the domestic policy mega bill he signed in July. The act cut tax incentives for solar and wind energy and electric vehicles, makes it easier and cheaper to drill or mine on federal lands, reverses efforts to cut emissions of methane, another greenhouse gas and increases government support for coal.

Calculating the lives lost

To understand the consequences of these moves, ProPublica and the Guardian used the results of modeling from Rhodium Group, an independent, nonpartisan research firm that analyzed the policy changes from this year. The group came up with a high, low and midrange estimate of the amount of additional emissions expected to be released in the next 10 years as a result of the rollbacks the EPA announced in March and the bill passed this summer. (The modeling also reflects changes to market forces and other factors.)

For our calculation, our starting point was Rhodium Group’s midrange number: 5.7bn metric tons of carbon through 2035. Using the firm’s other estimates would result in between 571,000 and nearly 2.2 million extra temperature-related deaths due to Trump’s policy changes. The Princeton University-led Repeat Project conducted a similar analysis and came up with 6.9bn metric tons, which would result in even more projected deaths.

To translate those emissions to deaths, ProPublica and the Guardian turned to the field of climate economics, which links human-generated emissions to measurable economic costs. A model that calculates what’s known as the social cost of carbon by Nobel laureate William Nordhaus has been used in federal policy since 2009, guiding everything from requirements mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission to EPA regulations.

While Nordhaus estimated the broad economic cost of the climate crisis, Bressler, the Bentley University professor, used his model to focus just temperature-related death. Drawing also on public health research, Bressler estimated the amount of carbon expected to cause one death over 80 years: 4,434 metric tons. The figure is equivalent to the average lifetime emissions of 3.5 Americans or 146.2 Nigerians. Using the same estimate, Bressler also calculated how many deaths are expected over the course of 80 years from each additional metric ton of carbon released into the atmosphere. He published his findings in Nature Communications in 2021.

In response to questions for this story, the EPA, which recently stopped considering the social cost of carbon at Trump’s direction, rejected Bressler’s scientific analysis. The agency called it “an exercise in moral posturing, not rigorous science” and said that the calculation of deaths per metric ton of carbon is “based on unvalidated extrapolations” and ignores “the dramatic uncertainties that dominate long-term climate projections”.

Climate scientists, however, said that the mortality cost of carbon is a valid metric. Peer reviewers for Bressler’s published research described his paper as “valuable and intuitive” and relevant for designing policy. After publishing the study, Bressler went on to serve as climate staff economist at the White House council of economic advisers from 2021-2022.

Others have emphasized that, because Bressler’s model focuses narrowly on the direct effects of temperature, the estimates it generates are vastly lower than the total death toll from the climate emergency. It also does not capture the serious but non-deadly effects of extreme heat, such as reduced productivity and increased misery.

Bressler acknowledges his work produces estimates and the true number of additional deaths due to greenhouse gas emissions will depend on several unknowable factors, including how quickly people adapt to changing temperatures and market forces. Critically, future presidents and other countries could also upend predictions by taking new steps to reduce emissions.

Bressler’s 2021 paper previewed multiple futures for the planet. Under what he calls the “pessimistic” scenario, global emissions wouldn’t level off until the end of the century. It was under this scenario that Bressler estimated that, by 2100, the climate crisis will have caused 83 million people to die of temperature-related deaths around the world. This is the scenario that would result in 1.3 million deaths by 2115 from the additional emissions released over the next 10 years as a result of Trump’s policies.

If global emissions were to drop to almost zero by 2050, the projected toll from temperature-related deaths would fall to 9 million by 2100. Even then, Trump’s policy changes this year alone would still result in an additional 613,000 deaths.

Experts agree that, while both of the scenarios Bressler lays out are possible, the most likely amount of emissions will fall between these two extremes. Still, Bressler said, the projections underscore what’s at stake.

“If you do things that add emissions, you cause deaths,” he said. “If you do things that reduce emissions, you save lives.”

The accident destroyed one reactor, Unit 2, and left the plant with one functioning reactor, Unit 1.","HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — The U.S. Department of Energy said Tuesday that it will loan $1 billion to help finance the restart of the nuclear power plant on Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island that is under contract to supply power to data centers for tech giant Microsoft.

The loan is in line with the priorities of President Donald Trump’s administration, including bolstering nuclear power and artificial intelligence.

For Constellation Energy, which owns Three Mile Island’s lone functioning nuclear power reactor, the federal loan will lower its financing cost to get the mothballed plant up and running again. The 835-megawatt reactor can power the equivalent of approximately 800,000 homes, the Department of Energy said.

The reactor had been out of operation for five years when Constellation Energy announced last year that it would spend $1.6 billion to restart it under a 20-year agreement with Microsoft to buy the power for its data centers.

Constellation Energy renamed the functioning unit the Crane Clean Energy Center as it works to restore equipment including the turbine, generator, main power transformer and cooling and control systems. It hopes to bring the plant back online in 2027.

The loan is being issued under an existing $250 billion energy infrastructure program initially authorized by Congress in 2022. Neither the department nor Constellation released terms of the loan.

The plant, on an island in the Susquehanna River just outside Harrisburg, was the site of the nation’s worst commercial nuclear power accident, in 1979. The accident destroyed one reactor, Unit 2, and left the plant with one functioning reactor, Unit 1.

In 2019, Constellation Energy’s then-parent company Exelon shut down the functioning reactor, saying it was losing money and Pennsylvania lawmakers had refused to subsidize it to keep it running.

The plan to restart the reactor comes amid something of a renaissance for nuclear power, as policymakers are increasingly looking to it to shore up the nation’s power supply, help avoid the worst effects of climate change and meet rising power demand driven by data centers.

Honda is striving to make battery-electric and fuel cell-electric vehicles represent 100% of auto sales globally by 2040, with a near-term focus on increasing sales of hybrid-electric vehicles, while also beginning the electrification of Honda powersports and power equipment product lineups. To reduce the environmental impact of its business operations, Honda is sourcing renewable energy to address CO2 emissions from its North American operations through long-term virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs) for carbon-free wind and solar power that cover more than 80% of the electricity Honda uses in North America.

Honda efforts also focus on decarbonization of its operations, including offices, warehouses, and manufacturing facilities and supporting its suppliers and independent dealerships across North America in their decarbonization efforts through the Honda Green Excellence Academy and Honda Environmental Leadership Program, respectively.

Regenerative agriculture improves soil health, removes carbon from the atmosphere and conserves water

Honda is supporting 1,800 metric tons of soil carbon removals as a step toward its decarbonization goals

Honda today announced that it has joined Carbon by Indigo, a leading program to help farmers across the U.S. adopt regenerative agriculture practices to improve soil health, capture carbon and increase their profitability. As part of its broader commitment to decarbonization, Honda is purchasing soil carbon removal credits through Carbon by Indigo, resulting in the removal of 1,800 metric tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Learn how regenerative agriculture is making a difference for farmers at https://honda.us/farmers.

Carbon by Indigo produces high-quality agricultural soil carbon credits in the U.S., providing farmers with opportunities to increase profitability while building soil health and long-term resilience. Participating farmers learn, adopt and expand regenerative practices tailored to their crop systems and local conditions, such as planting cover crops, reducing tillage, diversifying crop rotations and optimizing nitrogen application. These practices boost soil health, reduce surface water runoff and enhance air quality. As farmers implement and maintain these methods, they generate soil carbon credits by capturing carbon in the soil.

While water dynamics are highly local and field-specific, the practices in this project on average conserved approximately 69,000 gallons of water for every metric ton of carbon removed. Honda's investment in the soil carbon project supports farmers across the U.S., including approximately 150 farmers near Honda operations in Alabama, Indiana, North Carolina, Ohio and South Carolina, empowering them to adopt regenerative practices on a combined 214,000 acres of farmland. All credits in the Carbon by Indigo program have been independently verified by Aster Global Environmental Solutions and issued by the Climate Action Reserve, a trusted, high-quality carbon credit registry.

""For over 40 years, Honda has supported farmers near our Ohio operations through conservation programs that protect farmland and help expand access to markets for their crops,"" said Mahjabeen Qadir, sustainability strategy lead at Honda Development & Manufacturing of America, LLC. ""Now, Honda is building on that history by supporting regenerative agriculture practices that help farmers manage climate challenges and maintain healthy farmland for future generations.""

""Indigo proudly works with companies like Honda to take action on achieving their climate goals while creating impact for the communities in which they operate,"" said Dean Banks, CEO of Indigo Ag. ""The Carbon by Indigo program builds prosperity from the ground up, with tangible benefits for local communities and their environment: cleaner air and water, more resilient soil and crop production, additional income for farmers and their families, and a legacy of stewardship across generations.""

Honda aims to decarbonize its products and operations and use high-quality offsets only for the remaining greenhouse gas emissions that could not be eliminated. To advance this decarbonization goal, Honda has implemented the following initiatives:

Zero and low emissions products: Driving the transition to 100% battery-electric and fuel cell electric vehicles, starting with hybrid-electric models in the U.S.

Nature-based solutions: Planting over 85,000 trees to capture carbon and further restore biodiversity at Honda's Ohio operations

Home energy solutions: Providing home and vehicle energy management technologies to help customers reduce their environmental footprint

Energy-efficient operations: Reducing energy use and transitioning to low-carbon energy sources across Honda manufacturing facilities

Hydrogen technology: Expanding hydrogen fuel cell technology to commercial vehicles, stationary power generators, and construction machinery

It was the most serious nuclear power accident in the country’s history.
Attitudes toward nuclear power have softened in the United States, and it has political support among both Republicans and Democrats.
China has leapfrogged the United States in nuclear power, and while it has similar safety standards, its approval system is more predictable.
In addition to the technical challenges of restarting a mothballed nuclear plant, there are lingering safety concerns.","The Trump administration is giving a $1 billion loan to help restart a nuclear plant at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, boosting a project that aims to provide power to Microsoft’s vast network of data centers.

The funding, announced by the Energy Department on Tuesday, would help restart Three Mile Island Unit 1, which shut down in 2019. The other unit at the site near Harrisburg, Pa., shut down in 1979 after its reactor had a partial meltdown and released a small amount of radioactive material into the air. It was the most serious nuclear power accident in the country’s history.

The plant became synonymous with the dangers of nuclear power and fueled public opposition to new nuclear projects for decades, even as safer reactors were developed.

Last year, Unit 1 became the face of a potential revival of the nuclear power industry when Microsoft and Constellation, Unit 1’s owner, announced a deal to restart the plant.

Nuclear energy is one of the options large technology companies like Microsoft are considering to help power the vast networks of data centers needed to provide all kinds of computing services, from social media to artificial intelligence. Google and Amazon have also signed deals with nuclear operators and developers.

Attitudes toward nuclear power have softened in the United States, and it has political support among both Republicans and Democrats. The industry’s supporters have said that the U.S. regulatory system drives up the cost of construction. China has leapfrogged the United States in nuclear power, and while it has similar safety standards, its approval system is more predictable.

The Trump administration has said it wants to reduce regulations at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which certifies that a reactor is safe before it is built. President Trump signed an executive order in May directing the agency to take no more than 18 months to approve applications for new reactors.

The Three Mile Island restart project would “help ensure America has the energy it needs to grow its domestic manufacturing base and win the AI race,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement on Tuesday. Constellation said the loan has “made it possible for us to vastly expedite this restart without compromising quality or safety.”

Under the deal to revive the plant, Microsoft would buy as much power as it can from the plant for 20 years in an effort to add carbon-free electricity to the grids that power its operations.

Neither Constellation nor the Energy Department provided details of the loan or its terms. But Constellation said the loan would help it secure cheaper financing. The revived plant, named the Crane Clean Energy Center, is expected to come online in 2027, pending approvals from regulators, the company said in September. With 500 full-time employees, the site is 80 percent staffed, it said.

Once online, the 835-megawatt reactor will produce enough electricity to power roughly 800,000 homes, according to the Energy Department.

In addition to the technical challenges of restarting a mothballed nuclear plant, there are lingering safety concerns. In August 2024, about a dozen people opposed to the plant’s reopening protested outside its gates.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/19/multimedia/19xp-nuclear-gzvf/19xp-nuclear-gzvf-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 11:04:32.927223

Along with a new power grid system, he said the country was in the midst of a “comprehensive green transition of social economic development”.
As in many countries, Wang suggested there was some resistance to change, but the president had sent a clear signal about the direction of travel.
It is responsible for more than 30% of global emissions.
The lack of a strong public alliance between the EU and China leaves a gap in global climate diplomacy.","China is committed to the energy transition needed to avert climate breakdown – but does not want to take the lead alone in the absence of the US, one of the country’s senior advisers has told the Guardian.

Wang Yi said China would provide more money to vulnerable countries, but the EU’s climate commissioner has warned Beijing is not doing enough to cut emissions.

“I don’t think China would like to play a leadership role alone,” said Wang, the vice-chair of China’s expert panel on climate change. “The most important thing is how to maintain momentum. Now we have two possible directions: one, we go forward with clearer, more ambitious targets. The other may be going back.

“So that’s why China would like to do our best to steer in this kind of direction towards low-carbon or green transition, but in cooperation with other countries. We don’t want to take the lead alone. We need comprehensive leadership.”

In an exclusive interview, Wang said theChinese president, Xi Jinping, was committed to the energy transition for the long haul despite resistance from some industrial sectors. He explained that China’s priority in Belém was to help the Brazilian presidency achieve a successful climate conference, and to show the benefits of multilateral decision-making. On Tuesday, the first draft of a possible agreement was published at the Cop30 summit, reviving the hotly contested plan to transition away from fossil fuels.

China is the planet’s biggest emitter of carbon dioxide from burning of coal, oil and gas, but it is now also a world leader in the production, installation and export of wind turbines, solar panels and electric cars.

He said China wanted to “speed up and scale up its efforts to provide more global public goods” despite serious geopolitical and economic tensions and unilateral barriers to trade, including tariffs. The country’s emissions have been flat or falling for 18 months.

He estimated China’s per capita power consumption would continue to grow from 7,000 kilowatt hours in 2024 to “well over 10,000, maybe 12,000” – but there would be a steady move away from fossil fuels to wind and solar, as well as green hydrogen, green ammonia and electric vehicles. Along with a new power grid system, he said the country was in the midst of a “comprehensive green transition of social economic development”.

As in many countries, Wang suggested there was some resistance to change, but the president had sent a clear signal about the direction of travel. “Even in China, we have a lot of industrial conflict ... but the central government, including President Xi, is very clear to us that we must, in the next five years’ time, speed up the new power system.”

In the absence of the US, China’s role is even more crucial than usual to the success or failure of Cop30, where the Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has urged his negotiators to lay the foundations for an exit ramp out of the fossil fuel era.

Wang, who is an ecological economist and standing member of China’s state congress, said a roadmap would be challenging – particularly if it tried to impose a single set of criteria. “I think it’s very difficult. We cannot have a unified pathway for a phasedown or phaseout,” he said. “Different countries, based on different conditions, have different strategies and different transition pathways.”

He added that Trump’s second term would have a bigger impact than his first because the US had adopted more aggressive anti-climate policies. He also noted that the European Union was distracted by the war in Ukraine and economic problems.

After Trump’s imposition of hefty tariffs, Wang said progress on spreading green technology was being slowed by trade barriers, which particularly affected developing nations. He was also concerned about the high price of carbon in Europe: “I think some countries have double standards. On the one hand, they want China to speed up, to reduce our emissions, to take the lead, but on the other hand, they worry about China’s competitive capacity and also very important, maybe security … because there are very high ratios of China’s products.”

Despite the considerable gap between nations’ plans to cut emissions and what is needed to hold temperatures to 1.5C, he said China did not want to discuss targets at this Cop summit.

On the crucial issue of climate finance, Wang urged Europe and other early industrial nations to step up to the goal of providing $1.3tn (£988bn) for poorer nations to move their economies away from fossil fuels – and adapt to the growing threat of droughts, floods, extreme heat and more violent storms.

Wealthier countries have argued that China is now rich enough to make a contribution. Wopke Hoekstra, climate commissioner for the EU, said China needed to take more responsibility for cutting carbon, adding: “China is by far the world’s largest emitter; according to the UN it is an upper middle income country. It is responsible for more than 30% of global emissions.

“So at the moment China is not doing what science expects it to do – that has effects way beyond China itself. That is why we would hope to see more Chinese ambition going forward.”

He said the EU had made a strong diplomatic push to forge common interests with China on climate issues at a series of meetings this year. But the trading bloc has angered Beijing with a tariff that penalises imports of high-carbon goods such as steel coming from countries with inadequate policies in place to cut emissions. The lack of a strong public alliance between the EU and China leaves a gap in global climate diplomacy.

Wang said China was planning to increase its financial contributions to the global south, and that the government’s draft five-year plan mentioned the provision of “more global public goods”.

The Brazilian presidency of Cop30 has begun the process of releasing iterations of draft decision texts on all of the topics under discussion. The most closely watched is the “mutirao decision” which takes in contentious issues on which there is so far little agreement: finance, transparency, trade and the fact that countries’ emissions-cutting plans fall drastically short of the stringent cuts needed to limit global heating to 1.5C, a goal of the Paris agreement.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b5fe3cbd5867a0282002ee55f5682277a45e626/291_0_7549_6040/master/7549.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e240ecfdb09de1bbddc8c96f783b6075",N,,2025-11-19 11:06:24.834003

ERCOT battery profits drop as market saturation reshapes Texas storage

After the gold rush, operators pivot as profits slide

CALGARY, Alberta (Nov. 19, 2025) Enverus Intelligence® Research (EIR), a subsidiary of Enverus, the most trusted energy SaaS company that leverages generative AI across its solutions, is releasing its latest analysis on the ERCOT battery energy storage system (BESS) market, highlighting the dramatic shift in profitability and operator strategies as battery saturation transforms the Texas power landscape.

Average annual revenue for batteries in ERCOT has dropped sharply from $149 per kilowatt in 2023 to just $17 per kilowatt projected for 2025. The share of ancillary services in BESS revenue has fallen from 84% to 48% over the same period, forcing operators to pivot away from traditional strategies and adapt to a rapidly changing market.

“ERCOT’s battery market has reached a critical turning point. As saturation drives down profitability, operators must evolve beyond ancillary services and embrace sophisticated strategies to remain viable,” said Juan Arteaga, PhD, principal analyst at EIR.

Key takeaways:

ERCOT’s installed BESS capacity surged to 11 gigawatts by mid-2025, with batteries delivering more than 7 gigawatt-hours during peak demand.

Market saturation has driven ancillary service prices down, with average annual battery revenue collapsing nearly 90% in two years.

Profitability among operators now depends more on strategic site selection, operational timing, and energy market optimization, rather than fleet size or scale.

Energy arbitrage strategies have become widespread, but have not offset declining returns, with most major operators posting year-to-date profitability below 2.2%.

Future market success will require advanced approaches as ERCOT transitions to Real-Time Co-optimization plus Batteries (RTC+B), making service selection and timing increasingly critical.

Chicago, IL – November 19, 2025 – Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Bloom Energy BE, OPAL Fuels OPAL and FuelCell Energy FCEL.

Industry: Alt-Energy

Link: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2792288/3-alternative-energy-stocks-to-watch-amid-near-term-challenges

A strong outlook for wind energy installations is poised to support alternative energy stocks. However, escalating turbine costs, along with U.S. tariffs and recent policy shifts, may temper their momentum, especially as the One Big Beautiful Act remains a significant obstacle. Even so, accelerating transportation electrification is expected to fuel substantial near-term growth in the U.S. electric vehicle market, providing a meaningful boost to clean energy stocks. The forerunners in the U.S. alternative energy industry are Bloom Energy, OPAL Fuels and FuelCell Energy.

About the Industry

The Zacks Alternative Energy- Other industry can be fundamentally segregated into two sets of companies. While one group is involved in the generation and distribution of alternative energy and electricity from sources like wind, natural gas, biofuel, hydro and geothermal, the other is engaged in the development, design and installation of renewable projects involving these alternative energy sources.

The industry also includes a handful of stocks that offer fuel cell energy solutions, which have gained popularity as affordable, clean energy options lately. Per the BloombergNEF report, published in September 2025, renewable energy investments set another record in the first half of 2025, rising 10% year over year to $386 billion. With similar or more investments expected in the coming years, the industry boasts solid growth opportunities for its participants.

3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Alternative Energy Industry

Wind Energy – A Major Driver of Growth: Wind energy is expanding quickly, supported by favorable policies, rising climate awareness, and its affordability as a renewable power source. Wind power is one of the lowest-cost energy sources, and ongoing technological improvements have enhanced its competitiveness against conventional fuels.

Larger and more efficient turbines are delivering significantly higher output, improving overall project performance and profitability. These factors have created a strong market for wind energy. A recent Wood Mackenzie report has highlighted the sector’s rapid acceleration, projecting that the global wind industry will reach its second terawatt of capacity by 2030. According to the same report, global additions are expected to hit a record 170 GW in 2025, with more than 70 GW projected in the fourth quarter alone, the largest quarterly build ever.

Wood Mackenzie also expects about 9.1 GW of wind additions per year over the next five years, totaling 46 GW by 2029 and cumulative wind capacity is projected to reach 196.5 GW. Together, these trends underscore a strong growth outlook for the U.S. wind sector, supporting broader expansion across the alternative energy industry.

EV Market Surge to Accelerate Clean Energy Adoption: Electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming a key force in reducing transportation-related emissions. Expanding EV charging infrastructure, government subsidies, tax credits, grants, and perks such as carpool-lane access, is prompting more U.S. consumers to transition from gasoline models to EVs. Meanwhile, lower battery costs are driving further growth in the U.S. EV market.

According to Electric Cars Report, in the third quarter of 2025, U.S. EV sales shattered all previous records, hitting an all-time high of 438,487 EVs. It surged 40.7% sequentially and was up 29.6% from the prior-year level. Per a report by Statista, the EV market in the United States is projected to reach revenues of $105.8 billion in 2025. It is expected to show an annual growth rate (CAGR 2025-2030) of 8.57%, resulting in a projected market volume of $159.7 billion by 2030. Such an impressive outlook bolsters the prospects of clean energy stocks, which offer the largest electric vehicle charging network in the United States.

Increasing Costs Driven by Tariffs and OBBA: Escalating renewable installation costs have become a major hurdle for clean energy developers. In particular, higher steel prices, critical for manufacturing large wind turbine components, have recently pushed wind installation expenses even higher. Adding to the pressure, the U.S. government’s elevated import tariffs, introduced in early 2025, have further increased cost burdens across the wind sector.

According to a Wood Mackenzie report, tariffs and policy uncertainty have posed significant challenges for the market, causing a 50% decrease in turbine orders in the first half of 2025 compared to that a year ago, taking them to their lowest level since 2020. The OBBBA brought significant changes to the tax credits available for eligible clean energy components and facilities, including terminating the advanced manufacturing production tax credit for wind components sold after Dec. 31, 2027.

To this end, it can be said that the expiration of tax credits drives project costs up far more than tariffs. Since these credits significantly reduce expenses, their expiration makes renewable energy development and production much more expensive.

Zacks Industry Rank Reflects Grim Outlook

The Zacks Alternative Energy industry is housed within the broader Zacks Oils-Energy sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #142, which places it in the bottom 41% of more than 243 Zacks industries.

The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates gloomy near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

The industry’s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is due to a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts have lost confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential over the past few months. The industry’s bottom-line estimate for the current fiscal year has moved down 15.4% to $2.04 since June 30.

Before we present a few alternative energy stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation.

Independent testing confirms that its advanced Sigma Pyrolysis system eliminates 99.98% of PFAS compounds across all waste streams, including biosolids, discharge water, and exhaust gases.

This achievement marks the most comprehensive validation of the system’s performance to date.

Extensive testing confirms high efficiency

The rigorous study, conducted by engineering experts at Brown and Caldwell, involved sampling at eight points throughout the Bioforcetech process.

Results revealed that the thermal oxidizer, located before the exhaust scrubbing stage, is where the majority of PFAS destruction occurs. This highlights the system’s carefully optimised design and operating conditions as key to achieving near-complete removal.

The testing builds on previous evaluations, including internal assessments by Bioforcetech and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) studies.

Advanced analytical methods were used for each phase of the process: EPA 1633A for solids, OTM 45 for exhaust gases, and high-sensitivity tests conducted in partnership with North Carolina State University.

The combined results confirmed that just 0.02% of PFAS compounds remain anywhere in the system, demonstrating unprecedented effectiveness in removing these persistent chemicals.

Transforming waste into value

Beyond PFAS elimination, Bioforcetech’s pyrolysis process converts treated biosolids into a sustainable, value-added product called OurCarbon®.

Testing verified that all PFAS originally present in both wet and dry biosolids are fully removed from this end product.

This dual benefit – creating PFAS-free outputs while generating a usable carbon material – positions Bioforcetech’s technology as a game-changer for wastewater treatment facilities seeking environmentally responsible solutions.

Dario Presezzi, CEO of Bioforcetech, added: “This milestone further drives the proof that pyrolysis of biosolids is a clear solution for the PFAS problem.

“The results from this testing give Bioforcetech even further confidence in our thermal process to alleviate wastewater plants of their biosolids burden and produce a value-added output product.”

A new standard in wastewater management

Bioforcetech’s success with PFAS removal offers a promising pathway for municipalities and industrial facilities struggling with the environmental and regulatory challenges of PFAS contamination.

The combination of thermal treatment and sustainable resource creation demonstrates that it is possible to protect water and air quality while producing valuable byproducts.

As PFAS continues to threaten communities worldwide, innovations like Bioforcetech’s pyrolysis system are paving the way for safer, more sustainable, and circular approaches to managing biosolids and other waste streams.",https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/shutterstock_2358492255.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 12:06:37.223550

As the U.S. retreats from global climate efforts, it’s easy to focus on the negative. Yet most companies and investors aren’t just maintaining their sustainability commitments — they’re accelerating them.

New research indicates that the private sector is forging ahead. A Harvard Business Review analysis of 75 global companies found 53 percent are holding steady on sustainability commitments, 32 percent are expanding on them — and just 8 percent are retreating. According to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), the adoption of science-based targets continues to accelerate, with the number of companies setting near-term targets doubling and those committing to net-zero targets tripling in the past 18 months.

Next, follow the money. Globally, clean energy and grid investments are projected to reach $2.2 trillion in 2025 — twice the amount expected to flow into fossil fuels. Despite the U.S. federal government’s dismantling of policies supporting clean energy, S&P Global Commodity Insights estimates that clean energy will keep growing at a strong clip in the U.S. through 2030. Clean energy stocks are soaring — the S&P Global Clean Energy Transition Index gained 44 percent over the past year, significantly outpacing fossil fuels, with the S&P 1500 Oil & Gas Drilling Sub-Industry Index dropping 17 percent.

Blue-chip companies lead the way

Companies and investors we work with are taking strong public action. For instance, this year, General Mills updated its Climate Transition Action Plan, sharpening the action around four climate levers, from agriculture to transportation, first identified in last year’s plan to help meet its goals of cutting emissions by 30 percent by 2030 and achieving net zero by 2050. With a strong focus on assessment, policy, governance and human rights, the updated plan underscores General Mills’ commitment to transparency and collaboration.

Corporate water action is also gaining ground. Our latest Valuing Water Finance Initiative benchmark shows that two-thirds of companies improved their performance since 2023. Danone, Gap, Microsoft and PepsiCo lead the way in the four major industries we assessed, making advances on several fronts to reduce their impact on water and strengthen resilience. This is in line with expectations of the initiative, which is the only investor-led global effort focused on water action.

The role of investment and advocacy

With COP30 in the Brazilian Amazon putting the spotlight on protecting forests and other natural ecosystems, Nature Action 100 is proving how quickly investors can mobilize for change. Since its launch two years ago, the world’s first and largest global investor-led initiative on nature and biodiversity loss has expanded to over 240 investor participants, underscoring the growing recognition that nature’s resilience is essential to safeguarding the global economy.

And then there’s advocacy. For all the talk that companies are afraid to speak out in this political environment, they continue to do the important work of pushing for climate and clean energy policy. We saw dozens upon dozens of major companies and investors head to Capitol Hill throughout 2025 to champion and defend federal clean energy incentives, advanced manufacturing investment and good-paying jobs.

This fall, we watched more than 40 business entities rally in support of reauthorizing California’s nation-leading cap-and-invest program. That’s a timely reminder about the opportunity for states to set policy and provide leadership. And late last month, leading companies in Illinois successfully backed the passage of one of the most important affordability wins of the year — model legislation for reducing electricity costs, modernizing infrastructure and delivering clean energy.

Stay focused despite the headwinds

Now, I am very clear-eyed about the current headwinds. At a time of global economic change, when the U.S. has every incentive to lead in clean industries and technologies, the federal government is actively obstructing progress on clean energy and competitiveness. Meanwhile, special interests are waging a politically-driven campaign to force investors to ignore climate risks, introducing hundreds of state laws to control private investment strategy.

But despite all of this obstructionism, companies are acting and investment is flowing. Because sustainability is good for business and essential for long-term value creation and global competitiveness. The only affordable path for meeting America’s surging energy demand is through clean, American-made power.

A decade after the Paris Agreement, while we’ve fallen short of our most ambitious emissions goals, we must recognize the progress we’ve made. We avoided the UN’s projected estimate of up to 7.8 degrees Celsius of warming by the end of the century and the Rhodium Group estimates that warming is highly unlikely to exceed 3.9 degrees by 2100 and could be limited to 2 degrees. Every single tenth of a degree of warming counts.

So stay focused. Make the case through advocacy, investment, or transition plans that clean energy is essential to economic growth and energy security as power demand and prices continue to rise. Just last month, JPMorgan’s global head of sustainable solutions underscored this point, warning that the U.S. will struggle to meet the energy demands of its rapidly expanding tech sector without wind and solar.

Trust science and market forces

Around the world, the momentum behind a sustainable, clean energy economy is undeniable and unstoppable. It’s propelled by potent market and geopolitical forces including accelerating competition, rising energy demand, the global race for energy security, and the need to cut pollution and safeguard natural resources that businesses rely on. Politics will shift, but physics and market forces won’t.

Act globally. International cooperation, coupled with private sector action, is an economic imperative to prevent escalating financial risks. A new Ceres analysis shows that five key drivers of nature loss could cost eight global sectors up to $430 billion each year. Yet, government and business action are already fueling economic and job growth, innovation and investment worldwide.

I’m an optimist, precisely because of the 35-plus years Ceres has spent driving home the business case for sustainability. Now is the moment to focus on how far we’ve come, how much we’ve learned and how much we have to gain — and lose.",https://trellis.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/trellis_editorial_climate_commitment_1470x894.png,N,,2025-11-19 11:04:36.553231

And there, underlying the lush forests and riverbeds of East Texas, sits the Carrizo-Wilcox — a big, juicy pig, with no one standing guard.
Sitting on top of a gold mine doesn’t mean that every resident of East Texas could be about to strike it rich.
“We cannot compromise one region for another,” State Representative Cecil Bell said to another packed room, this time at the Texas State Capitol in Austin.
High-quality monitoring could give the groundwater conservation districts the data they need to say no to big projects that are deemed unsustainable.","The farmers and ranchers who descended on city hall in Jacksonville, Texas, had been told to “leave their pitchforks at the door.” While everyone ultimately arrived unarmed, the attendees of the June 19 board meeting of the Neches & Trinity Valleys Groundwater Conservation District were ready for a fight.

In the hallway outside the boardroom, wives tried to cool their husbands with handheld paper fans that flapped uselessly amid a sea of silver hair — stoic men with sweat-slicked brows beneath weathered cowboy hats, veterans’ insignia, and red MAGA ball caps. Near the chamber door, a uniformed officer stood sweating through his shirt, trying to enforce the fire marshal’s 150-person limit while the crowd swelled behind him. The sign-in table, barely visible through the crush, had already collected nearly 100 names — almost all were there to speak out against the water permits requested by two shadowy LLCs tied to hedge fund manager Kyle Bass and his investment group, Conservation Equity Management Partners.

The permit applications submitted by Bass’ Redtown Ranch Holdings LLC and Pine Bliss LLC collectively request permission to withdraw approximately 15 billion gallons of water annually from the Carrizo-Wilcox aquifer in East Texas, an amount residents fear will run their wells and farms dry. Without taking off their “Don’t Tread On Me” t-shirts, the citizens of six East Texas counties where Trump took around 80 percent of the vote last November are now turning to their state government to protect them from billionaires.

Jacksonville sits about two hours southeast of Dallas. With a population just shy of 15,000, it’s the largest city in Cherokee County, one of the three counties represented by the Neches & Trinity Valleys Groundwater Conservation District. The trees in the county are lush and tall, and the Neches and Trinity Rivers gently flood the landscape with a predictability that local farmers use to their advantage. The county’s tight-knit residents typically vote Republican, they’ve told me over the years, to protect their freedom from government overreach. But as they watch water conflicts breaking out all over Texas, they feel their communities are being overwhelmed by heavy industry and profiteering. Some locals have started making the case that it’s not government overreach for the state to step in when the fight’s not fair.

Melisa Meador, who identified herself as a wife, mother, Christian, and pecan farmer with 600 acres near Bass’s Redtown Ranch — one of the LLCs looking to pump groundwater — took a prophetic tone in her testimony to the conservation district board. “Those who endlessly accumulate sow the seeds of their own destruction,” Meador said at the podium with the cadence and poetry of a revivalist. “Today’s water barons join river to river, well to well, until all water flows through their meters. Their thirst for profit can never be quenched.”

For his part, Bass feels he’s being mischaracterized. “I’m not coming at this as a robber baron, and I’m not coming at this as someone who intends to do any harm whatsoever,” he told me in the hall after taking a break from being public enemy number one inside the Jacksonville boardroom. “If they come back to me and say, ‘You’re going to do harm, you need to reduce your permit,’ I’m a very reasonable person.”

He’s not shy about his intentions for the water, though he insists that he does not already have buyers lined up. The water, should he get it, could be transported out of East Texas to any number of bone-dry cities west of the Carrizo-Wilcox. Unless the government wants to hang a “closed for business sign on I-35,” he said, there has to be some solution to the statewide water shortage. Really, he said, the amount of water he’s talking about exporting is a drop in the bucket — less than 1 percent of what the state needs.

“I mean, we’re talking about a large amount of water in this area, but a very small amount of water as it relates to the state,” Bass said. “The state has a real problem.”

He’s right. Droughts have always been part of Texas weather, but with climate change, they’ve grown longer and hotter. Meanwhile, increasingly unpredictable torrents of rain are flooding canyons and tributaries, but doing little to refill the aquifers under parched, hard land.

West Texas is getting drier, heading toward all-out catastrophe for high desert cities and the state’s treasured spring-fed rivers. The Panhandle and Gulf Coast are scrambling for new water sources as agriculture and industry outpace local basins and aquifers. As drought conditions persist, the primary urban corridor, Interstate 35, has boomed with massive, thirsty tech companies that exhaust local water supplies in metropolis-adjacent exurbs. And the Edwards Aquifer — the massive limestone tank under southwest Texas — cannot support more growth, rendering San Antonio desperate for imported water. Like ravenous wolves, the thirsty cities are on the prowl for water. And there, underlying the lush forests and riverbeds of East Texas, sits the Carrizo-Wilcox — a big, juicy pig, with no one standing guard.

San Antonio struck first, running its 140-mile Vista Ridge pipeline and pulling 16 billion gallons per year from the Carrizo-Wilcox, causing wells in some rural counties to sputter. Fast-growing Austin suburbs also began sinking proverbial straws in their surrounding counties, laying pipe to keep up with exploding development. In Lee County, just east of Austin, the San Francisco-based water asset management firm Upwell Water announced plans to build a pipeline so big that the cities of Bryan and College Station, along with Texas A&M University, jointly filed suit to stop what they see as a groundwater grab.

There’s more to the pipeline-palooza than just competition for scarce resources. There are also fortunes to be made. Conservationists, well drillers, and even industry insiders have started comparing the rush on the Carrizo-Wilcox to the oil frenzy of the Texas Permian Basin or the California gold rush. But this time, the boomtowns won’t spring up next to the pumps. The real fortunes — and the real growth — are happening hundreds of miles away, in cities that may never lay eyes on the rural wells quenching their thirst.

Sitting on top of a gold mine doesn’t mean that every resident of East Texas could be about to strike it rich. The infrastructure to pump and export billions of gallons of water is more than most farmers and ranchers could afford — so they can’t drain their own land. Nor will water exporters need to pay them top dollar for their largest tracts. All an exporter needs is a couple of acres and some antiquated property rights.

In Texas, landowners enjoy the “rule of capture,” a doctrine based in Roman and Old English law giving them the right to harvest whatever groundwater flows under their property, even if it causes problems for their neighbors. This regularly did cause problems between neighbors — especially if one neighbor was an industrial farmer — so in 1940, Texas established groundwater conservation districts to serve mostly as monitors and arbiters. As regulatory bodies, they are ill equipped to impose strong enough penalties to stop an operation like Bass’. District boundaries often follow county lines, a demarcation which, many have pointed out, means nothing to the water flowing below. If the district tells you no in one county, you can just go next door.

Some in Texas, including some Republican lawmakers, would like to see that change. Following the June 19 meeting in Jacksonville, the Neches & Trinity Valleys Groundwater Conservation District ultimately opted to kick Bass’s permit request to the State Office of Administrative Hearings, a referee in complex regulatory fights that’s intended to give citizens, companies, and government entities a legal forum for high-stakes disputes — like who gets to pump 15 billion gallons of East Texas groundwater. The hearing has yet to be scheduled, in part because of lawsuits filed by many of the people and businesses who could be affected. But the outcry in Jacksonville sparked a growing awareness that every single Texas politician represents one of two kinds of places: districts that need water, or those that stand to lose it.

“We cannot compromise one region for another,” State Representative Cecil Bell said to another packed room, this time at the Texas State Capitol in Austin. The House Natural Resources Committee convened on July 15 specifically to talk about Bass’ permits, but found themselves wrestling with the statewide dilemma as well. The 11-hour hearing was like a marble and brass version of the Jacksonville meeting, complete with air conditioning problems in the Capitol annex. Many of those who showed up in cowboy hats to Jacksonville were now in suits and ties. In addition to the 13 members of the committee, six state representatives and two state senators stayed seated on the dais until nearly midnight — a startling show of interest in a topic usually delegated to staffers and lobbyists.

That night, several expert witnesses and more than one state representative suggested that it might be time to rethink the rule of capture and move toward a more modern means of regulation that can balance the needs of neighbors and water systems across the state. But property rights in Texas are sacrosanct, and folks in rural Texas don’t necessarily trust the government — even the one they voted for — to regulate in their favor.

Industry veteran Johnnie Parker, owner of a wastewater cleaning company near the area Bass wants to pump, attended the hearing in Austin — he was one of the few attendees who’d stuck with jeans and a ball cap instead of a suit — and expressed doubts about whether the Legislature or even the State Office of Administrative Hearings would ever side with rural East Texas. “To me it’s a circus when it comes to these hearings and what not … there’s a lot of things that happen behind closed doors that the general public doesn’t get to see,” Parker said, sitting on a bench in the vaulted, echoing hallway outside the hearing. He rubbed his fingers together to indicate the power of money. “Until the Legislature gets together and decides they want to change the laws on how these things are regulated, this is just a smoke screen.”

Most of the testimony indicated that regulation should fall to the groundwater conservation districts, which would need “more teeth” to protect their jurisdictions. That might be the most politically feasible way forward. The Legislature this year already raised the maximum fine allowed for overpumping, from $10,000 to $25,000. It also considered a bill to increase funding for groundwater research, which could help develop tools for better real-time monitoring of water levels in high-demand aquifers like the Carrizo-Wilcox. High-quality monitoring could give the groundwater conservation districts the data they need to say no to big projects that are deemed unsustainable. Additional legislation could help those denials hold up in court when property owners dispute them.

Representative Cody Harris represents most of the area where Bass wants to pump and also happens to chair the Texas House Natural Resources Committee. After the hearing, he filed two bills in the special legislative sessions Texas convened in July and August — one bill to prohibit water exports from East Texas and another to fund a study of the Carrizo-Wilcox to determine just how vulnerable it is to over-pumping. The clock ran out on both bills, but Harris feels confident they will fare well in the 2027 Legislature, which many expect to be dominated by water issues.

But the Austin hearing underscored an uneasy feeling growing in some rural communities. While the science and governance of millions and billions of gallons were extensively debated, barely a question was asked about the millions and billions of dollars to be made selling that water. Back in Jacksonville, speaker after speaker had scoffed at the idea that Bass would walk away from profit if it hurt his rural neighbors. But in Austin, it was only Parker, out in the hall, talking about the influence money would have on the future of water in Texas. For him and others raising concerns, the water wars are the latest example illuminating the power big money can wield over politics when regulation — usually anathema to free-market conservatism — isn’t strong enough to keep it in check.

This tension between political principle and existential threat was evident back in Jacksonville at the hearing on June 19, when Miria Dean — who lives two miles from Redtown Ranch — chatted with others who’d arrived too late or given up trying to get on the list of speakers inside. She told me she saw Bass’ plans as “greed, pure and simple.” What’s legal and what’s right aren’t always the same, she said. Then she paused, smiled, and added, “Happy Juneteenth, right?” We regarded each other, both taking in the significance of the holiday that happened to coincide with the hearing. Slavery was once legal in this country, but it had never been right.

When I asked who should intervene to stop Bass, Dean recoiled at the idea of big government. But her stance was more complex than that. “We still want the government’s hands off. We don’t want their nose in our business. We want them to step in, but only as far as we want them to step.”

Even capitalism, the guiding ethos of small government, is no longer a free pass. “Capitalism is a great thing,” one speaker said at the Jacksonville hearing. “Unfettered capitalism is bad.” The crowd applauded.",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Texas-aquifers.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-11-19 06:57:38.381057

The oil can coat feathers and fur of wildlife, poison marine life and destroy sensitive habitats like coral reefs and mangroves.

Different types of technology can be used to prevent and treat oil spills, helping to protect ecosystems and recover as much oil as possible.

Energy Digital has ranked 10 of the top oil spill response technologies.

10. Autonomous surface vessels

Leading company: Sea Machines Robotics

Founder & CEO: Michael G. Johnson

HQ: Boston, Massachusetts, US

In 2019, Sea Machines Robotics successfully deployed the industry’s first autonomous spill-response vessel.

The autonomous systems are placed on skimmer boats and can be controlled remotely to deploy on-board booms, skimmer belts and other equipment.

It can be operated in an unmanned autonomous mode, allowing operators to respond to spill events without exposing crewmembers to challenging weather or toxic fumes.

The vessel has the potential to increase the safety, productivity and predictability of response for marine oil spill operations.

9. Drones and aerial surveillance

Leading company: Chevron

CEO: Mike Wirth

HQ: Houston, Texas, US

A remotely monitored drone – called an AiRanger – can help inspect oil and gas pipelines.

Chevron, working together with American Aerospace Technologies, Inc. (AATI), became the first companies permitted to use these uncrewed aircrafts by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).

The AiRanger has a wingspan of 18 feet, making it larger than a traditional drone but smaller than a piloted plane.

It can fly for 12 hours which is more than twice as long as other types of aircraft, providing real-time reports of any threats and risks in Chevron’s pipelines which could lead to spills.

8. X-band radar-based detection

Leading company: Petrobras

CEO: Magda Chambriard

HQ: Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

Brazil’s environmental agency reached an agreement with Petrobras in 2018, encouraging the company to expand its oil spill detection operations in the Campos Basin near Rio de Janeiro.

Ocean monitoring company Miros Group provided Petrobras with oil spill surveillance technology.

The system provides continuous automatic oil spill detection using x-band radar, thermal imaging, vessel tracking and infrared cameras.

It can help to accurately detect oil spills early on, allowing Petrobras to respond to the spills and recover as much oil as possible.

7. Satellite monitoring technology

Leading company: Saudi Aramco

CEO: Amin H. Nasser

HQ: Dhahran, Saudi Arabia

Petroleum and natural gas company Saudi Aramco has introduced satellite technology to help detect marine oil spills.

This is to help protect coral reefs, due to the threat oil spills pose to the economy and the environment.

The satellite features Synthetic Aperture Radar sensors (SAR) that provide high-resolution images that allow oil slicks to be identified due to disrupted ocean backscatter.

Aramco’s technology can help make informed decisions to safeguard people, assets and the natural environment.

It provides advantages including rapid spill identification, real-time imagery for spill impact management and threat assessments.

6. Sorbents

Leading company: Sorbcontrol

General Manager: Juan Francisco Pozzi

HQ: Barcelona, Spain

Sorbents are materials that soak up oil while repelling water, removing the last traces of oil that mechanical methods usually miss.

Sorbcontrol specialises in designing and producing a variety of oil spill solutions, including sorbents. The company says it has worked with businesses including Repsol.

It provides sorbents that can treat both marine and industrial spills, with sorbents that can absorb only hydrocarbons or those that absorb all liquids, including chemicals and water.

Juan Francisco Pozzi, General Manager at Sorbcontrol, said on LinkedIn: “Seeing our solutions in action reinforces our commitment to helping teams tackle environmental challenges head-on and protect our oceans.”

5. Subsea containment and recovery systems

Leading company: Ambipar

CEO: Tercio Borlenghi Jr.

HQ: London, UK

Offshore containment aims to capture and collect oil directly from the source of the leak, before sending it to surface vessels for removal.

If successfully deployed, offshore containment can prevent the majority of leaking oil from reaching the environment.

Companies like Ambipar offer equipment that can be rented out to tackle oil spills.

Its containment package includes a 10 foot container, offshore boom and hydraulic hoses, while its recovery package includes an offshore skimmer and a transfer pump.

4. Capping stacks

Leading company: Shell

CEO: Wael Sawan

HQ: London, UK

The Marine Well Containment Company (MWCC) was founded by Shell and other global oil and gas leaders to better prepare the industry for deepwater well control incidents.

This initiative is designed for subsea well containment, featuring equipment including capping stacks.

A capping stack is placed over a well to shut it in and stop the flow of oil and gas, containing any spills and mitigating environmental damage.

The equipment is designed to be quickly transported to an incident site and lowered to the well, where its valves can be closed to contain oil.

3. Chemical dispersants

Leading company: bp

CEO: Murray Auchincloss

HQ: London, UK

bp extensively used dispersants during the Deepwater Horizon incident in 2010, which was one of the biggest oil spills in history.

Chemical dispersants are used to mitigate the impact of an oil spill from coating shorelines and harming coastal wildlife.

During the incident, bp applied chemical dispersants on the surface of the water using aircrafts and directly into the well at the source of the spill.

Dispersants work by breaking down oil into smaller drops that can more easily mix with the water, which helps remove it from the surface of the ocean.

To be fully effective, chemical dispersants must be added into the water quickly after an oil spill has taken place.

2. Oil skimmers

Leading company: Enbridge

CEO: Gregory Ebel

HQ: Calgary, Canada

Enbridge uses different types of oil skimmers for both industrial cleaning and emergency oil spill response.

One type of skimmer is an oleophilic (oil-attracting) skimmer, which is used to lift oil from the surface of the water.

These can be belt skimmers which use a continuous belt and wiper blessed to scrape oil into a container, or mop skimmers which use a series of mops to blot oil from the water.

Enbridge also employs tube skimmers, using a floating horizontal tube to collect oil which is then stripped off and drained into a collection vessel.

Despite having strict oil spill response measures, the company says it believes that all incidents can be prevented.

It aims to limit the environmental impact of spills by working to contain the oil, prevent further damage and protect nearby wildlife.

1. Containment booms

Leading company: ExxonMobil

CEO: Darren Woods

HQ: Houston, Texas, US

The Valdez oil spill took place in 1989 and was one of the biggest learning experiences in ExxonMobil’s history.

The company took immediate responsibility for the spill and worked to clean it up using technology like containment booms.

Containment booms are temporary floating barriers used to contain oil on the surface of water to prevent it from spreading.

In the oil spill, ExxonMobil first focused on protecting nearby salmon hatcheries by deploying booms between the oil and the salmon streams.

After oil was contained by the booms, it was removed by skimmers and other treatments.

Containment booms are very commonly used to treat oil spills thanks to their high effectiveness in various weather conditions including wind and storms.

Darren Woods, CEO and Chairman of ExxonMobil, says: “We have a philosophy to be the most responsible operator in our industry.

“For as long as there’s a demand for oil and gas, you want the most responsible companies producing that.”",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/a61ec1f2fc0d1b35bcd7fdaff404487c:356a89f49bb7c6947238ba30f6420443/energy-top10-graphics-cms-oil-spill-response-technologies.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 06:00:23.573476

In North Carolina, health care providers cannot expand services — be it new MRI machines, hospital beds, operating rooms — unless they are filling a pre-identified need.
DHHS identifies these needs by looking at population numbers, demographics and utilization of various health care facilities, services and equipment to see what local area needs what.
Briner believes those inflated prices are part of the reason the state health plan is so broke.
Lawyers also emphasized how CON supports the affordability and equitable geographic distribution of health care services.","RALEIGH — A three-judge panel heard cases for and against the constitutionality of North Carolina’s Certificate of Need law on Tuesday, pulling the central health care regulation in the state into question. The judges gave no timeline for when to expect their decision.

The constitutionality challenge began with one doctor’s fight to perform surgeries at his ophthalmology practice in Craven County.

When New Bern ophthalmologist Jay Singleton wanted to dedicate a room to provide more complex, invasive procedures, the state told him it was illegal. Why? The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services hadn’t identified a “need” for more operating room capacity in New Bern.

In North Carolina, health care providers cannot expand services — be it new MRI machines, hospital beds, operating rooms — unless they are filling a pre-identified need. DHHS identifies these needs by looking at population numbers, demographics and utilization of various health care facilities, services and equipment to see what local area needs what. Health care providers then apply to meet those needs.

Carolina Public Press published a full explainer on the law last year.

Because of CON, Singleton was relegated to performing his surgeries at the local hospital, instead of expanding capacity at his clinic.

Singleton took DHHS to court over the law, arguing it stifles free-market competition. The case originally went all the way to the state Supreme Court. The Supreme Court decided Singleton’s case wasn’t just about his practice, but the constitutionality of the law on its face. They sent it back to the Wake County Superior Court three-judge panel that heard the case Tuesday to weigh the constitutionality questions.

Republican State Treasurer Brad Briner intervened in the case on behalf of Singleton, arguing that CON inflates health care prices. Briner believes those inflated prices are part of the reason the state health plan is so broke. The John Locke Foundation, a North Carolina-based conservative think tank, is also supporting Singleton.

Democratic Gov. Josh Stein, DHHS, and the Republican leaders of both the state Senate and the state House have asked the three-judge panel to dismiss the case.

Republican Judge Jeffrey Foster of Pitt County, Republican Judge Troy Stafford of Iredell County and Democratic Judge Jacqueline Grant of Buncombe County made up the panel.

A little history

If the judges rule that CON law is unconstitutional, it wouldn’t be the first time. The North Carolina Supreme Court found the state’s original CON law unconstitutional in 1973.

In 1974, Congress adopted the National Health Resources and Development Act, which strongly incentivized states to have Certificate of Need laws. President Gerald Ford signed the measure into law the following year. While not an outright mandate, the measure encouraged most states to adopt these laws. Louisiana was the lone holdout.

North Carolina approved a new CON law in 1977, which has since been revised several times through subsequent legislation, but has not faced a serious court challenge — until now.

Arguments against constitutionality

Joshua Windham of the Institute for Justice, a nonprofit libertarian law firm based in Virginia, represented Singleton at the hearing.

Windham argued that CON law violates the North Carolina constitutional promise that each resident has the right to enjoy the fruits of their own labor. It also violates anti-monopoly and anti-exclusive privileges laws, Windham argued.

CON law tends to favor hospital systems that already have a strong foothold in the market, which is why Windham called the law a “monopolist’s dream” at the hearing. He said the law increases health care costs, reduces access to care, and harms patients. The other side, though, believes that the law decreases costs and protects access to care. It’s fairly hard to prove either side right.

Windham also argued that the law stifles competition.

“How does limiting services ever lead to lower costs?” he asked the judges.

Arguments for constitutionality

The arguments in favor of the law revolved around the idea that CON isn’t truly inhibiting Singleton’s ability to practice medicine and earn a living. Lawyers also emphasized how CON supports the affordability and equitable geographic distribution of health care services.

Derek Hunter, the lawyer representing DHHS, argued that CON ensures that rural North Carolinians do not go underserved. If there is a need, there will be a service, in a perfect application of the law. Hospitals can’t just target metropolises and avoid rural communities, where high percentages of Medicare/Medicaid recipients result in lower margins for hospitals.

Plus, Hunter said, health care is not a normal marketplace that relies on supply and demand. Competition between providers won’t necessarily drive costs down, because of price transparency issues and so many health care decisions being made under duress.

But the hearing got stuck on one unusual argument from Hunter. He argued that due to a loophole in the law, Singleton could just do whatever surgeries he pleases in his procedure rooms. He doesn’t need an operating room to do an operation.

“Dr. Singleton is free to perform any surgery he wants,” Hunter said. Just in a procedure room, not an OR.

Windham accused Hunter of bringing this “bizarre” argument in “at the eleventh hour” to “muddy the waters” and “get the case off the docket.”

As a result of Tuesday’s hearing, the panel is expected to issue a decision on the constitutionality of the law. Whatever that decision is, it’s likely to be appealed.

For their part, typical EV batteries usually have a decade-long, 100,000-mile warranty and ""rarely need replaced,"" according to Recurrent.","Italian startup Avathor has created one of the more noble ways to use end-of-life electric vehicle batteries. The company's Avathor One upgrades the aging, yet still functional, packs to power small vehicles that can carry people in wheelchairs or people who have mobility issues.

""Instead of letting end-of-life EV packs sit idle, the company is repurposing them,"" Carscoops' Thanos Pappas wrote about the innovation.

It's an invention that extends the use of expensive batteries that are chock-full of materials that often require invasive mining and processing to produce. It also shows that unlikely partners are willing to work together when it matters most.

The batteries are from Stellantis, the automaking giant with well-known brands in its portfolio. Avathor One was designed by Italdesign, which is part of competitor Volkswagen Group. It helps that all of the companies involved have key operations in Turin, where the vehicle is being developed, according to Carscoops.

And the ride lives up to its Italian roots. It's sleek and modern, resembling a vehicle from ""Tron."" A rear-side ramp allows wheelchair access. The vehicle is controlled with a joystick, has a 31-mile range, and can go about 6 mph. It also has a load of sensors, cameras, and LED lights to ensure a safe trip, according to the company website.

And if successfully rolled out — plans are to launch in Italy this year, followed by other markets — it could improve lives in more ways than one.

Aging EV batteries pose a significant environmental hazard if improperly trashed. They are a fire risk when sent to landfills and can leach toxic metals into the environment, according to the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

But even after 10-20 years powering EVs, the packs still have plenty of ability for service outside of the regular rigors of road travel. California's B2U Storage is using old EV batteries to store solar energy for grid support. An innovation in England has converted diesel trucks to electric power, sucking the last life out of packs as they carry them to a recycler, as other examples.

That's in addition to investments from Mercedes and others to better recycle key battery components for reuse, helping to lower pack costs and prevent harmful waste.

It's important to note that tens of millions of tons of deposits from Earth will be needed in the coming decades to power the shift to cleaner technology. So every recycled pack can reduce the need for new materials. But that load of metals and minerals is still far short of the 16.5 billion tons of dirty fuels mined from the ground each year, Sustainability by Numbers reported.

For their part, typical EV batteries usually have a decade-long, 100,000-mile warranty and ""rarely need replaced,"" according to Recurrent.

That's why making the switch to a cleaner ride is a value that provides, on average, $1,500 in savings on gas and service costs with no more oil changes. Certain states still offer a range of perks for buying and charging one. Ford's Power Promise even pays for an at-home charger and installation when you purchase or lease one of its EVs.

Importantly, each EV that replaces a gas-burning vehicle prevents thousands of pounds of planet-warming fumes, the Department of Energy reported. What's more, the Environmental Protection Agency has a laundry list of health risks associated with breathing the tailpipe exhaust, including cancer and airway damage.

Avathor One is an innovative example that extends the usefulness of cleaner technology.

But nowadays, you know, like how lots of new gas stations came — things change,” Poudel said.
City officials say the existing number of gas stations already meets the needs of Littleton’s 46,000 residents, while electric vehicle adoption continues to grow statewide.","LITTLETON, Colo. — City leaders in Littleton will extend a temporary moratorium on new gas station development, a move designed to curb emissions and accelerate the community’s shift toward cleaner transportation.

The city, which already has 24 gas stations — roughly one for every 2,000 residents — first enacted the moratorium in May. On Tuesday night, council members extended that pause another 180 days to allow time for changes to Littleton’s Unified Land Use Code.

“The City of Littleton put in place a development moratorium for Fuel Sales (Retail) uses that were not already under review on May 6, 2025,” said Jessica Bixenman, the city’s communications director. “The moratorium was established after a study session that discussed the existing number and proposed additional fuel sales locations within the city. An economic analysis of fuel sales uses was provided at the Sept. 16, 2025, City Council meeting. As a result of that meeting, City Council directed staff to extend the moratorium and draft a text amendment to the Unified Land Use Code (ULUC) focusing on where the use would be allowed and implementing additional development standards. Staff intends to hold a study session with the Planning Commission in January as a next step in completing the text amendment to the ULUC. Tonight's council action is the extension of the moratorium to complete the code amendments.”

For Puspa Poudel, who has owned Horizon Food and Gas for eight years, the pause offers some optimism amid high competition from large chains.

“When we started, it was really, really good at the beginning. But nowadays, you know, like how lots of new gas stations came — things change,” Poudel said. “When a big gas station opens right next to you, you really cannot compete much, and then it hurts your business.”

“They are purchasing inventory high, so they get the better deal. And you really cannot compete, because you already buy your purchasing price so high. I'm really, really hoping no more new builds,” she said.

City officials say the existing number of gas stations already meets the needs of Littleton’s 46,000 residents, while electric vehicle adoption continues to grow statewide.

Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office, said EV sales in the state have jumped in recent years.

Littleton extends pause on new gas stations as city eyes a cleaner future

“If you look back over the last year, it's varied a little bit, but it's varied between about 25 and 33% of new vehicle sales being EVs,” Toor said. “When you think of the smog and ozone problem we have in Denver and in the northern Front Range, one of the biggest things we can do to tackle that air pollution is move to electric vehicles.”

""The Energy Office really has the mission of both improving air quality and reducing greenhouse gas pollution while helping to reduce consumer energy costs,"" Toor added, saying state-level tax credits have helped customers overcome initial costs. ""We think that those consumer incentives have really helped people to get past the first cost of an EV so that they can then benefit from all of those long-term fuel and maintenance savings.""

While Toor said Colorado’s market momentum for EVs is likely to continue, he noted the federal government is “certainly going in a different direction.”

“The Trump administration has turned away from electric vehicles, whether... removing vehicle emission standards that supported cleaner vehicles, including electric vehicles, or removing the federal tax credit that was $7,500 for each passenger vehicle,” Toor said. “It's a little early for us to know what the impact is going to be, but it's certainly going to make it... harder for EVs in the United States.”

“This stuff is generating astronomical amounts of money for localities,” data center developer Tom Dakich said. “We do a bad job of bringing the transparency of those numbers, and the numbers are staggering.”

Dakich, who was involved in the Digital Crossroad data center in Hammond, spoke to the Strategic Energy Growth Task Force during an afternoon meeting at the Indiana State Museum.

The industry is also doing a “bad job” talking about the “de minimus” amount of water needed for cooling the massive facilities, he said.

That’s putting some off Indiana, said Dakich, who added, “We’ve got to figure out a way to make those public officials insulated.”

Rep. Ed Soliday, R-Valparaiso, said lawmakers have already attempted.

Legislation to take control over large-scale utility infrastructure projects decisions has failed repeatedly.

“We said, ‘Let us take responsibility, and we’ll set the standards.’ And they didn’t want that. They wanted complete control,” he said.

In November, Standing Rock Public Transit added a new electric van to its fleet, with a longer driving range than the first.","This summer, Len Necefer finally planned the road trip he’s been thinking about for nearly a decade: Going coast-to-coast in an electric vehicle, stopping only to charge on tribal lands.

As a Navajo citizen and tribal energy expert who used to work in the federal government, he saw it as the ultimate test of how far energy infrastructure had come.

Stop by stop, his plans came together until North Dakota, where a dearth of chargers seemed to prevent a Midwest crossing. Then, he spotted it: a level-2 charger at Sitting Bull College on the Standing Rock Reservation.

50 States, 50 Fixes is a series about local solutions to environmental problems. A few more to come this year.

It was more than a lucky break. Over the past three years, Standing Rock has installed chargers across the reservation as part of the Electric Nation project, a regional effort to create an intertribal charging network.

By the time the project wraps at the end of November, Standing Rock Nation will operate 13 E.V. chargers, most of them in North Dakota. While there aren’t many E.V.s in town yet, each new charger makes driving one easier than before.

“I want to show folks that this technology is not out of our affordable reach, but that it is here for us to use,” said Joseph McNeil, the chief executive of SAGE, a clean energy organization owned by the tribe that is spearheading the project.

The Standing Rock Reservation, home to the Lakota and Dakota peoples, is rural and spread out, straddling the border between North and South Dakota. The cost of gas aggravates the reservation’s high poverty rates. With the closest commercial centers at least an hour away, access to reliable transportation is a measure of well being.

“Our economic situation shouldn’t dictate our access to sustainability,” Mr. McNeil said. He wants every SAGE project to create jobs or revenue for the tribe. Institutions that are hosting the E.V. chargers, like the college, will eventually take ownership of them and collect any revenue.

SAGE’s project director, Fawn Wasin Zi, said E.V.s were part of a longstanding push for clean energy on the reservation. In 2016, the tribe was in the midst of planning a wind farm when protests to block the Dakota Access Pipeline engulfed the reservation. Their fight against a plan to transport oil over their sacred lands was recognized with an award from the Wallace Global Fund, which came with a $250,000 prize and a $1 million investment earmarked for the ongoing wind farm project.

The tribe may be widely known for the anti-pipeline movement, Ms. Wasin Zi said, “but there’s so much more going on.” She was managing the wind project at the time and used the prize to start SAGE. “The traditional way is to live with Unci Maka, Grandmother Earth, not against her,” she said.

The pipeline also helped inspire the regional E.V. project.

“As I was protesting, I thought, ‘What if we connected all the tribes in an electric vehicle charging network?’” said Robert Blake, a solar energy developer in Minneapolis. “It would be another form of resistance against fossil fuel infrastructure.” A few years later, Mr. Blake formed Native Sun, a nonprofit group dedicated to renewable energy outreach in tribal nations.

In 2021, Native Sun and SAGE teamed up and jointly won a $6 million Department of Energy grant to create Electric Nation. More funders followed, and the project took off.

Today, eight chargers have been installed at key locations around Standing Rock including local schools, a tribal administration building, Sitting Bull College and two casinos. Four more, coming later this month, will mark the completion of the project.

There’s even more in Red Lake Nation, where Mr. Blake is from. He has heard from other tribes in different parts of the country who now want to recreate Electric Nation on their lands. The network is a crucial first step in helping residents see gas-free cars as a viable, climate-friendly option.

SAGE has also used grant funding to give six electric vehicles to various institutions across the reservation.

These vehicles are improving daily life in small but meaningful ways. Sitting Bull College’s facilities director, Scott Gates, now uses a Ford Lightning E.V. to haul equipment and rescue cars stuck in the snow. Leo Red Horse, a clerk at the tribe’s administrative offices, takes an electric shuttle, provided by Standing Rock Public Transit, to work most mornings. Four teachers share a ride to the local elementary school in a Chevy Blazer, which is often plugged in to the school’s solar-powered chargers.

In November, Standing Rock Public Transit added a new electric van to its fleet, with a longer driving range than the first. It will take riders as far as Bismarck, N.D., the nearest commercial hub, an hour away. The school district also has plans to purchase several more electric vehicles for teacher car pools, along with some electric school buses.

SAGE hopes to eventually place a community-shared E.V. and charger in each of the reservation’s eight districts. In a place with a 40 percent poverty rate, free access to an E.V. matters. Even though electric cars typically cost less than gas ones over the lifetime of the vehicle, the initial purchase does not.

There’s also broad concern about how the cars will fare in the region’s harsh winters. Cold weather, combined with energy needed to heat the car, can affect battery efficiency and cause an E.V.’s range to drop by up to 30 percent.

Climate-friendly choices often have to take a back seat in light of the struggles many people on the reservation face daily, like affording food for the next day, said Steve Sitting Bear, the tribe’s recently elected chairman.

But, “inherently, as tribal members, we don’t like to see the destruction of the environment, of our land, the poisoning of our water,” he said. “I want us to be a self-sufficient, sovereign nation leading the way, whether that’s with wind or solar.”

Today, SAGE’s small team is juggling several projects alongside building out the electric vehicle network, including the ongoing wind farm development and a community solar project.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/18/multimedia/18cli-50x50-nd-promo-jghb/18cli-50x50-nd-promo-jghb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 02:58:10.609303

The federal subsidies did not guarantee that nuclear energy could be produced at competitive rates compared to other generation sources.
These states also adopted additional state-level derisking policies to provide further impetus for developers to undertake nuclear projects.
Welton and Harrison suggest that additional public oversight of derisking initiatives is necessary to manage the hidden risks associated with energy projects that rely on derisking policies.
Climate derisking is a complex and uncertain method for pursuing clean energy, Welton and Harrison acknowledge.","Scholars argue that failed nuclear projects reveal flaws in strategies to promote renewable energy today.

With climate change, many scientists fear that if countries do not mitigate global warming through decarbonization, sea levels will continue to rise, natural disasters will become more common, and large swaths of the planet may become uninhabitable.

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which the U.S. Congress adopted in 2022, aims to encourage private investment in renewable energy. It seeks to promote this investment through “derisking”—the use of government incentives to increase the attractiveness of private investments into clean energy by minimizing the risk of profit loss. Sometimes referred to as a “carrots without sticks” approach to decarbonization, the IRA leverages tax credits for clean energy industries and includes conditions that enhance the value of these tax credits to spur investment.

In a recent article, Shelley Welton of the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School and Conor Harrison of the University of South Carolina critique the IRA’s derisking approach by examining a prior use of this strategy—a failed attempt to revive the U.S. nuclear energy industry in the early 2000s. Drawing on this failure, they argue that derisking clean energy projects may result in utility ratepayers bearing the financial burden of projects with little to no decarbonization benefits.

Derisking strategies have been present in the United States for a long time, note Welton and Harrison. They trace these strategies back to land grants and financial incentives for railroads in the 1880s. Over the past 50 years, the U.S. government has leveraged risk mitigation tools to promote renewable energy following the advent of electricity markets—often with great success, according to Welton and Harrison.

Yet they point to one former climate derisking effort—the attempted restoration of U.S. nuclear power in the early 21st century—that they observe offers several important cautionary lessons for regulators.

Starting in 2000, concerns about rising energy prices, air pollution, and the recent accident-free record of nuclear generation prompted utilities to consider new investments. A subsequent broad lobbying effort culminated in the passage of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. This law offered production tax credits, loan guarantees, and risk insurance to utilities willing to invest in new nuclear reactors. Welton and Harrison explain that the goal of these incentives was to lower the barrier to entry for utilities and help shield investors and lenders from risks associated with the new projects.

But according to Welton and Harrison, these incentives failed to entice a large majority of U.S. energy firms. The federal subsidies did not guarantee that nuclear energy could be produced at competitive rates compared to other generation sources. Welton and Harrison explain that only a handful of southern states—those that relied on traditional public utility regulation that ensured utilities could pass construction costs onto customers—chose to pursue these nuclear incentives. These states also adopted additional state-level derisking policies to provide further impetus for developers to undertake nuclear projects.

The results were grim, say Welton and Harrison. They observe that Georgia’s Plant Vogtle was the sole example of a completed nuclear reactor built using incentives provided by the Energy Policy Act. This project, however, was completed over a decade behind schedule and cost more than $35 billion, double its initial budget.

South Carolina fared no better, according to Welton and Harrison. They explain that the state never completed its nuclear venture, leaving two unfinished reactors and nearly $9 billion in costs. Florida and North Carolina, two other states that pursued nuclear investments, also abandoned their projects. Utilities forced ratepayers to shoulder much of the financial burden of these failed nuclear projects with very little to show for them, Welton and Harrison note.

Drawing on these case studies, Welton and Harrison identify a few hidden risks in derisking initiatives that threaten to derail future climate investment. For example, they cite permitting hurdles and legal challenges that have frequently delayed energy projects. Welton and Harrison explain that new energy ventures often unfold at a glacial pace, spanning decades. At the same time, energy markets undergo dramatic shifts in the background, changing the financial calculus that prompted the initial project investments. Political and institutional commitments also keep these failed projects alive long after investors should have withdrawn their support.

Welton and Harrison argue that poorly designed derisking strategies—ones that do not adequately address these hidden risks—result in clean energy projects that can harm communities and fail to decarbonize the grid. Local communities will frequently bear the financial burden of these projects, despite the promised national benefits these projects often fail to deliver. Welton and Harrison suggest that additional public oversight of derisking initiatives is necessary to manage the hidden risks associated with energy projects that rely on derisking policies.

Climate derisking is a complex and uncertain method for pursuing clean energy, Welton and Harrison acknowledge. But they note that derisking is the politically viable path chosen by Congress, through the IRA, to address a warming climate. It is now up to federal administrators to protect against misguided projects, and their agencies must expand their capacities to manage the clean energy transition, Welton and Harrison argue.",https://www.theregreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Bradley11.19.2025-526258524.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 01:59:34.988862

There’s also the infrastructure problem: where exactly are you supposed to use this 450 kW charging capability?","The Lotus Emeya has set a new benchmark for production electric vehicle charging performance, reaching a peak rate of 443 kW during independent testing conducted by Lotus Al Ghanim in Kuwait. Using Lotus’s proprietary 450 kW DC ultra-fast charger, the hyper-GT completed a 10-80% charge in just 13 minutes and 35 seconds, even under extreme heat conditions. The achievement cements the Emeya’s position as one of the fastest-charging electric vehicles available to consumers in 2025.

The record represents a significant improvement over the Emeya’s previous charging benchmark. Earlier this year, the same vehicle achieved 402 kW during testing, charging from 10-80% in 14 minutes. That performance already placed the Lotus ahead of high-performance rivals like the Porsche Taycan and Hyundai Ioniq 6, which typically charge in the 300 kW range.

Advanced Battery and Cooling Technology Enable Record Speed

The Emeya’s charging performance is enabled by a cell-to-pack battery structure, which increases usable cell density by around 20% compared with traditional module-based designs. Lotus pairs this with a redesigned cooling system to maintain thermal stability during sustained high-power charging events.

Its 800-volt architecture, shared with the Lotus Eletre, boosts charging speed and improves overall efficiency. The system reduces heat, supports repeated fast-charging sessions, and helps keep energy consumption as low as 18.7 kWh/100 km (62 miles). Under ideal conditions, the Emeya can add up to 310 km (193 miles) of range in just 10 minutes.

The 2026 Emeya variant boasts a WLTP-rated range of up to 379 miles (610 km), making it one of the most efficient long-range EVs in its class. This reinforces Lotus’s commitment to both performance and practical real-world range. The engineering precision philosophy extends across Lotus’s history, evident in its EVs and collectible lightweight sports cars.

Charging Ecosystem and European Rollout

Lotus is expanding its 450 kW DC charging network across Europe, starting in Germany, with additional markets to follow. The ecosystem integrates with the Lotus Cars app and the brand’s HyperOS infotainment platform, offering intelligent EV routing, energy-aware trip planning and real-time charging optimization.

This growth supports the brand’s broader multi-powertrain strategy, which now includes future models like the upcoming plug-in hybrid Emira, showing how Lotus is balancing its electrified future with more traditional performance offerings.

Why This Record Matters

Reaching 443 kW puts the Emeya right at the forefront of real-world charging performance, showing Lotus’s ambition to lead the performance-EV market. As charging networks get better around the world, this kind of high-power charging will be key to cutting down on long-distance travel times and making EVs with big batteries more feasible.

For Lotus, this achievement makes the Emeya a standout in technology and highlights the company’s goal to merge its performance heritage with the latest in electrification, even as the business itself is going through changes.

EVXL’s Take

Lotus just achieved something genuinely impressive: the fastest production EV charging speed we’ve seen outside China’s domestic market. The 443 kW peak and sub-14-minute charging time beat Porsche, beat Tesla, and beat every traditional Western automaker. That’s the good news.

Here’s the uncomfortable reality: technical excellence doesn’t pay the bills. Lotus announced 550 job cuts at its historic Hethel headquarters in August 2025—40% of its UK workforce—after sales dropped 42% in Q1 2025. The company posted a $183 million net loss and is drowning in $3.3 billion of debt despite Geely’s massive investment. The Emeya and Eletre EVs, built in China, delivered just 719 units combined in Q1. Meanwhile, the company is pivoting to plug-in hybrids because pure EV demand hasn’t materialized as expected.

The charging record also highlights an uncomfortable truth we’ve been tracking at EVXL: Chinese automakers are winning the ultra-fast charging race. While Lotus hits 443 kW, Chinese rival Zeekr is achieving 630 kW peaks with its 7X SUV, charging from 10-80% in under 10 minutes. BYD announced 1,000 kW charging capability that adds 249 miles in just five minutes. Lotus is celebrating a record that’s already been surpassed in the Chinese market where the Emeya is actually manufactured.

There’s also the infrastructure problem: where exactly are you supposed to use this 450 kW charging capability? In the U.S., Tesla’s V4 Superchargers max out at 500 kW, and those are still rare. Most public fast chargers deliver 150-250 kW. Electrify America stations hit 350 kW if you’re lucky and they’re working. Lotus is building its own 450 kW network in Europe, but that’s a chicken-and-egg problem: you need critical mass of vehicles to justify the infrastructure investment, and Lotus sold just 41 vehicles in Australia through July 2025.

The Emeya represents everything Lotus does well: brilliant engineering, cutting-edge technology, genuine performance credibility. It also represents everything Lotus struggles with: premium pricing in a value-conscious EV market, Chinese manufacturing facing Western tariff barriers, and a brand identity crisis between heritage sports cars and luxury EVs.

So yes, 443 kW is legitimately impressive. The engineering team at Lotus deserves recognition for pushing the boundaries of what’s commercially available. But world-class charging speed won’t save a company that can’t move metal off dealer lots. In the EV industry’s brutal shakeout, technical prowess is table stakes—survival requires solving the much harder problems of cost structure, market positioning, and achieving scale.

Most non-Tesla charging stations had become inoperable, suggesting a disturbing motive. Public outrage expressed how these actions could impede progress toward cleaner transportation.

The Redditor shared their situation in the r/Reno subreddit. They described widespread vandalism that had crippled the city's EV charging infrastructure. The post is from three years ago, yet it highlights an ongoing issue.

""Some nut job has cut all the EV charging cables in Reno except for Tesla,"" the user wrote. ""I have nowhere to charge my car for work now.""

The user said Electrify America stations in Sparks, Nevada, and EVgo cables were targets as well.

""The cables were cut at the base of the charging station. They didn't leave anything behind,"" they explained.

Some believed it was a deliberate act of destruction rather than theft. The pattern of vandalism had left many EV drivers in Reno without charging access.

Instances of EV and charging station vandalism such as this are frustrating for drivers.

By September 2024, vandals had cut 215 of the 1,000 Electrify America charging stations in North America, according to Insurance Journal. Similar incidents pose a significant barrier to the adoption of EVs.

Vandalized charging stations impact drivers' daily commute and ability to travel. This premeditated destruction can also make potential EV buyers hesitant. They may start thinking EVs have an unreliable infrastructure.

Vandalism can also slow the transition away from dirty energy sources such as gas and oil. Fewer EVs on the road means more tailpipe pollution, leading to poor air quality and public health in our communities.

Concerns about pollution from battery manufacturing are sometimes raised. However, cars with the ""dirtiest"" batteries are still cleaner than cars with no battery. Each year, millions of tons of minerals get used for the clean energy transition. This is a fraction of the billions of tons of dirty energy, burned and not reusable, extracted yearly.

More security and respect for charging stations could be a vital part of supporting a cleaner, safer future.

While progress may be on the way, EV drivers can reliably charge at home by installing solar panels. One of the many benefits of EVs is they are more cost-effective than gas-powered vehicles, with home solar energy being cheaper to use for charging than relying on the grid or public stations. Qmerit offers quick, free installation quotes for Level 2 chargers. EnergySage and its TCD-vetted local installers can save you up to $10,000 on installations.

Power consumption has grown 20 gigawatts from the previous winter, the North American Electric Reliability Corp. said Tuesday in its winter assessment. A gigawatt is the typical size of a nuclear power reactor. Supply hasn’t kept up.

As as result, a repeat of severe winter storms in North America that unleash a polar vortex, of which there have been several in recent years, could trigger energy shortfalls across the US from the Northwest to Texas to the Carolinas. All regions have adequate resources in normal conditions.

“Data centers are a main contributor to load growth in those areas where demand has risen substantially since last winter.” Mark Olson, manager of the reliability assessment, said in an emailed statement.

America’s power grid has been facing rising blackout risks for years as aging infrastructure is increasingly stressed by severe storms and wildfires. Now the data center boom, driven by the spread of artificial intelligence, is adding to the strain by supercharging US electricity growth after being stagnant for two decades.

Winter is especially risky because solar generation is available for fewer hours and battery operations may be affected. Gas supplies, meantime, could drop off because of freeze-offs or pipeline constraints.

The areas designated by NERC as having elevated risks of shortfall shifted from the previous winter to include the US southeast and parts of the West, including Washington and Oregon.

The Texas grid continues to be highlighted after cascading failures in February 2021 left millions of people without power for days and resulted in more than 200 deaths. New England also continues to face elevated risks on potential natural gas pipeline constraints.

When federal safeguards weaken, local rules decide how clean—or how dirty—the air gets. In mid-2025, the White House granted two-year delays for certain hazardous-air-pollutant standards covering dozens of large chemical-manufacturing facilities, including one within the Phillips 66 complex in Borger, Texas. Meanwhile, its sister refinery in New Jersey must carry on under the full force of both federal and state oversight. For families living near these plants, geography now dictates protection. Nearly 845,000 residents live within ten miles of New Jersey’s Bayway refinery—barely 2,200 around Borger’s—two very different stories emanating from similar operations and riding similar winds.

New Jersey — where the rules still mean something

The Phillips 66 Bayway Refinery in Linden processes about a quarter-million barrels of crude oil a day, bordered by neighborhoods, schools, and tidal marshes. Winds here usually blow from west to east, carrying faint refinery smells across Elizabeth and Bayonne toward the harbor and Staten Island. Residents notice it. But New Jersey’s environmental agency doesn’t wait for complaints; it has built some of the nation’s most stringent air pollutant regulations.

EPA modeling suggests that refineries the size and type of Bayway should carry some of the nation’s highest health risks from toxic air pollutants—driven mostly by formaldehyde and benzene. Yet that’s not what the real-world health impact data show. In the ten-mile corridor east and northeast of Bayway, where the emissions typically drift, COPD prevalence averages just under 5½ percent and cancer diagnoses just above 5½ percent—both below national levels. The likely reason: New Jersey’s unusually strict permitting rules and cumulative-risk reviews, which have forced steady reductions in emissions over time. The air isn’t pristine, but it’s measured, managed, and closely watched.

Each time Bayway seeks a permit or expansion, the state runs formal risk reviews that estimate potential cancer or health effects and require air-quality modeling to check whether emissions stay below safety targets. If the numbers don’t clear the bar, tighter limits or new controls follow. These reviews sit on top of federal rules that already require continuous benzene monitoring at refinery fencelines - think of a “fenceline” as where the plant’s air meets the public’s air, and the monitors are like smoke detectors that make sure pollution isn’t sneaking out. Bayway’s recent readings have stayed below the maximum levels, and state regulations go even further—folding the results into a broader look at cumulative risks (in NJ, other factors include automobile exhaust and pollutants from Newark International Airport) for nearby communities instead of treating each pollutant or permit in isolation.

Texas — where the guardrails are farther apart

A thousand miles from Linden, the Phillips 66 complex in Borger tells a similar story under looser rules. Built during the same early-20th-century oil boom as Bayway, it still anchors the skyline of this Panhandle town. The site actually includes two major operations: a refinery that handles about 150,000 barrels of crude a day and a chemical-manufacturing plant. The refinery remains covered by the federal refinery-sector standards, but the chemical unit was among roughly fifty facilities granted a two-year delay from updated federal hazardous-air-pollutant controls. For the next two years, that portion of the complex will rely primarily on Texas’s lighter-touch regulatory system.

Most of the year, Borger’s winds blow from the south, carrying emissions north toward Stinnett and Lake Meredith; in winter, they swing the other way. For many residents, the wind is simply part of life. Yet for those living downwind, the air doesn’t distinguish between refinery stacks and chemical stacks—it carries whatever leaves the fence line. In the ten-mile north-northeast sector downwind of Borger, the plant’s air toxins include a similar chemical profile: formaldehyde, benzene, and 1,3-butadiene. About 2,200 residents live inside that zone, and COPD rates sit at nearly 9½ percent, with cancer prevalence near 9 percent, both above Texas and national averages, and nearly double the rates seen in New Jersey.

Texas takes a lighter approach. The state environmental agency relies on Effects Screening Levels, guideline numbers for hundreds of chemicals that help decide whether a refinery’s projected emissions look acceptable. They’re not enforceable limits—just screens. If modeled levels exceed them, regulators may ask for adjustments, but plants usually keep operating while paperwork and negotiations continue. The refinery must still follow the same federal benzene fenceline rule as Bayway, yet other hazardous-air-pollutant controls that would tighten under HON are now paused. For the next two years, Borger’s air will depend largely on state discretion, not federal guidelines—a difference that runs like the wind.

Two refineries, same logo, different playbooks

On paper, the Bayway and Borger refineries operate under the same Clean Air Act rules and corporate safety commitments. In reality, though, their oversight couldn’t be more different. New Jersey measures and manages risk before a problem becomes a crisis; Texas trusts its screening levels and self-reporting to catch issues after the fact. With the federal HON standards on hold for at least two years, those differences now decide how much protection nearby families can count on. Same company, same history, same rulebook—but two entirely different games being played—one with referees on the field, one running only on the public’s trust.

Who’s in charge?

The EPA sets the national limits for hazardous organic emissions under the Clean Air Act. New Jersey’s Department of Environmental Protection goes further, layering its own risk thresholds and community reviews on top of those federal rules. Texas, by contrast, relies mainly on guideline numbers and industry self-reporting, stepping in only when those screens are exceeded. The result is a patchwork of protection that mirrors America’s political geography more than its science.

When federal protections pause, the air doesn’t. Pipes keep venting, wind keeps blowing, and communities keep breathing what comes their way. The real test will arrive not when rules restart, but when we measure what changed in their absence. New Jersey’s families will have spent those years under dual oversight. Borger’s will have spent them trusting that guidance levels and good intentions were enough. The question is not whether companies can meet the same standard, but whether the country still expects them to. Pollution and fairness drift on the same wind—and when safeguards go quiet, the air doesn’t wait. Neither should we.

For each refinery, I defined a 10-mile downwind sector based on prevailing winds (Bayway: ENE; Borger: NNE–ENE). I mapped a sector cone (±45–75° as needed to reflect seasonal shifts) and identified census tracts/ZCTAs whose centroids fall inside the cone.

See these rough images I used for all the screening tools:

Note that the prevailing wind in Linden is much more widespread seasonally than it is in Borger. Let me know if you’d like me to send specs to an artist, or if you’d like, you can certainly include these layers I built on top of Google maps.

Quick note on federal government environmental data and monitoring tools

It’s shocking to see how federal data collection, online tools, and educational information have disappeared from federal websites like the EPA, FDA, and others. The scrubbing and removal of the tools and information will undoubtedly have significant, irreversible impacts…probably a really good topic for another piece. It reminds me of the story surrounding the public reporting of COVID infections and the unwillingness of a Florida official to manipulate the data in 2020.

For example:

AirToxScreen is still online at EPA and described as an annual screening tool. EPA pages indicate a 2020 assessment released May 2024 though there’s no indication that it will be updated going forward.

In early 2025 the administration removed EJScreen (the environmental justice mapping tool) and other equity/data tools from EPA’s website; lawsuits and watchdog reports have documented those removals. Data is certainly missing everywhere, but even basic usability has degraded on all sites.

China is eyeing the global electric truck market Already the world’s largest exporter of passenger cars, China is turning its sights to the global electric truck market.","HANOI, Vietnam (AP) — China is replacing its diesel trucks with electric models faster than expected, potentially reshaping global fuel demand and the future of heavy transport.

In 2020, nearly all new trucks in China ran on diesel. By the first half of 2025, battery-powered trucks accounted for 22% of new heavy truck sales, up from 9.2% in the same period in 2024, according to Commercial Vehicle World, a Beijing-based trucking data provider. The British research firm BMI forecasts electric trucks will reach nearly 46% of new sales this year and 60% next year.

Heavy trucks carry the lifeblood of modern economies. They also contribute significantly to global emissions of carbon-dioxide: In 2019, road freight generated a third of all transport-related carbon emissions.

Trucking has been considered hard to decarbonize since electric trucks with heavy batteries can carry less cargo than those using energy-dense diesel. Proponents of liquefied natural gas have viewed it as a less polluting option while technology for electric heavy vehicles matures.

Liquefied natural gas, or LNG, is natural gas cooled to a liquid fuel for easy storage and transport.

China’s trucking fleet, the world’s second-largest after the U.S., still mainly runs on diesel, but the landscape is shifting. Transport fuel demand is plateauing, according to the International Energy Agency and diesel use in China could decline faster than many expect, said Christopher Doleman, an analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

Electric trucks now outsell LNG models in China, so its demand for fossil fuels could fall, and “in other countries, it might never take off,” he said.

Costs fall in China’s electric truck pivot

The share of electrics in new truck sales, from 8% in 2024 to 28% by August 2025, has more than tripled as prices have fallen. Electric trucks outsold LNG-powered vehicles in China for five consecutive months this year, according to Commercial Vehicle World.

While electric trucks are twice to three times more expensive than diesel ones and cost roughly 18% more than LNG trucks, their higher energy efficiency and lower costs can save owners an estimated 10% to 26% over the vehicle’s lifetime, according to research by Chinese scientists.

“When it comes to heavy trucks, the fleet owners in China are very bottom-line driven,” Doleman said.

Early sales were buoyed by generous government incentives like a 2024 scheme for truck owners to trade in old vehicles. Owners can get up to about $19,000 to replace older trucks with newer or electric models.

Investments in charging infrastructure are also boosting demand for electric trucks.

Major logistics hubs, including in the Yangtze River Delta, have added dedicated charging stations along key freight routes. Cities like Beijing and Shanghai have built heavy-duty charging hubs along highways that can charge trucks in minutes.

CATL, the world’s largest maker of electric vehicle batteries, launched a time-saving battery-swapping system for heavy trucks in May and said it plans a nationwide network of swap stations covering 150,000 kilometers (about 93,000 miles) out of China’s 184,000 kms (about 114,000 miles) of expressways.

Global energy markets will feel the impact

The surge in sales of electric trucks is cutting diesel use and could reshape future LNG demand, analysts say.

Diesel consumption in China, the second-largest consumer of the fuel after the U.S., fell to 3.9 million barrels per day in June 2024, down 11% year-on-year and the largest drop since mid-2021, partly reflecting the shift to LNG and electric trucks, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

“The rise of China’s electric truck sector is one of the more under-reported stories in the global energy transition, especially given its potential impact on regional diesel trade flows,” said Tim Daiss of APAC Energy Consultancy.

LNG truck sales peaked in Sept 2023 and March 2024 after China eased transport restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic, said Liuhanzi Yang of ICCT Beijing. By June 2025, sales had slipped 6% as electric trucks gained ground.

Shell’s 2025 LNG Outlook projects that demand for imported LNG in China, the world’s largest LNG importer, will continue to rise partly due to LNG trucks. It also suggests LNG trucking might expand to other markets, such as India.

China’s electric trucks are already cutting oil demand by the equivalent of more than a million barrels a day, estimates the New York-based research provider Rhodium Group.

But Doleman views LNG as a “transitional step” unlikely to be seen apart from in China, where a vast pipeline infrastructure, abundant domestic gas production and byproducts like coke oven gas created conditions conducive to LNG-fueled trucking not seen elsewhere.

China’s is planning new emission standards for vehicles that will limit multiple pollutants and set average greenhouse gas targets across a manufacturer’s fleet. This will make it “almost impossible” for companies relying solely on fossil-fuel vehicles to comply, Yang said.

A 2020 ICCT study found LNG-fueled trucks cut emissions by 2%-9% over 100 years but can be more polluting in the short run due to leaks of methane, a potent planet-warming gas that can trap more than 80 times more heat in the atmosphere in the short term than carbon dioxide.

Modern diesel now nearly matches LNG in air-quality performance.

China is eyeing the global electric truck market

Already the world’s largest exporter of passenger cars, China is turning its sights to the global electric truck market.

Chinese automakers have kept costs down and sped up truck manufacturing while ensuring different parts work seamlessly together with in-house production of most key components, from batteries to motors and electronics, said Bill Russo, founder and CEO of the Shanghai-based consultancy Automobility Limited.

China’s hyperactive delivery industry, particularly urban freight trucks, has been an early proving ground for these vehicles, he noted.

In 2021-2023, exports of Chinese heavy-duty trucks including EVS to the Middle East and North Africa grew about 73% annually while shipments to Latin America rose 46%, according to a McKinsey & Company report. The share of electrics is expected to grow, though limited charging infrastructure could pose a challenge.

China’s Sany Heavy Industry says it will start exporting its electric trucks to Europe in 2026. It is has already exported some electric trucks to the U.S., Asian countries like Thailand and India, and the the United Arab Emirates, among others.

In June, Chinese EV maker BYD broke ground in Hungary for an electric truck and bus factory, with an eye toward a mandatory European target of cutting carbon emissions from new trucks by 90% by 2040 compared to 2019 levels.

Prices of zero-emission trucks in Europe must roughly halve to become affordable alternatives to diesel, according to another study in 2024 by McKinsey.

Volvo told The Associated Press that it didn’t comment on competitors but welcomed “competition on fair terms,” while Scania did not respond.

“Things are shaking up,” Daiss said. ___

November 5: CAC President Elizabeth Wydra joined Canadian Broadcasting Corporation to discuss Learning Resources v. Trump.","This month, the Supreme Court is considering two major challenges to Trump overreach—one on its merits docket and one on its shadow docket—and CAC has been involved in both.

At the beginning of November, the Supreme Court heard oral argument in the challenge to President Trump’s unlawful tariffs. Our amicus brief ex

plained that President Trump doesn’t have authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to single-handedly set global tariffs. As CAC Legal Fellow Simon Chin explained after oral argument, “The Government argues that when Congress passed IEEPA, in 1977, it carried forward authority over tariffs from an older law called the Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA). But as Neal Katyal, counsel for the private challengers, emphasized at oral argument when citing our brief, a 1933 amendment to TWEA severed that law from its original war powers foundations.”

The stakes of this case are high, as CAC President Elizabeth Wydra emphasized in an interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. As Elizabeth explained, the Court has “so far, in this second Trump administration been very much acquiescent in Trump’s power grabs. This will be a test of whether they will actually be the check that the Constitution envisions on the Executive.”

Among Trump’s many other disturbing power grabs has been his deployment of the National Guard in American cities. CAC is fighting back in courts from coast to coast, filing amicus briefs against Trump’s unlawful use of the National Guard in Chicago, Los Angeles, and Washington D.C.

Most recently, CAC filed a brief in the Supreme Court explaining why it should deny the government’s request to stay a district court injunction blocking the deployment of the National Guard in Chicago. Our brief explains that Martin v. Mott, a case arising out of the War of 1812, doesn’t insulate the President’s deployment decision from judicial review.

Because the Trump administration relies on Mott in claiming that courts can’t review its decision to deploy the Guard, CAC’s historical research has been a helpful resource in setting the record straight. Our brief was cited as providing a valuable perspective in Slate magazine and the One First newsletter. And when Stephen Miller, the architect of Trump’s immigration agenda, seemingly claimed that Trump had unreviewable “plenary power,” CAC’s Deputy Chief Counsel Brian Frazelle was quick to explain that he was “flat wrong.”

With both the Los Angeles National guard case and the consolidated tariffs cases before the Supreme Court, CAC’s historical research provides key context and insight for the Justices. As Elizabeth suggested, now is the Supreme Court’s chance to show it can serve as a check on the Trump administration’s lawless actions.

Appalachian Voices v. Environmental Protection Agency — The D.C. Circuit is considering whether the Trump administration can unilaterally terminate an entire mandatory grant program created by Congress. Our brief argues that the Constitution’s separation of powers prohibits the President from unilaterally withholding federal funds based on disagreement with congressional policy, and because the Trump administration unilaterally terminated a mandatory grant program, the executive branch violated the Constitution’s separation of powers. C. Circuit Court of Appeals, brief filed November 3.

League of United Latin American Citizens v. Executive Office of the President — WIN — The D.C. District Court held that President Trump’s executive order requiring proof of citizenship on the Federal Form for registering voters violated the separation of powers. Echoing our brief, the court observed that the Elections Clause “provides that Congress—not the President—is the check on States’ authority to regulate federal elections.” C. District Court, decision rendered October 31.

Learning Resources v. Trump and Trump v. V.O.S. Selections — The Supreme Court is considering whether President Trump has the legal authority to single-handedly impose tariffs. Our brief responds to a historical argument made in support of the tariffs—namely, that the relevant federal law incorporates a traditional presidential authority to impose tariffs during wartime that traces back to the nineteenth century and was first codified in the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917 (TWEA)—explaining why this narrative is unsound at every step. Supreme Court, brief filed October 24.

Illinois v. Trump— WIN — In October 2025, the Seventh Circuit denied the administration’s motion for a stay, leaving in place a district court order that prevents troops from deploying in Chicago. In doing so, the Seventh Circuit adopted the reasoning of CAC’s amicus brief to conclude that Martin v. Mott does not foreclose judicial review. The Trump administration subsequently asked the Supreme Court to stay the district court’s order, and CAC filed an amicus brief opposing the administration’s application, reiterating our arguments about why courts can review the President’s decisions to mobilize the National Guard. That application is currently pending. Seventh Circuit, brief filed October 12, decision rendered October 16, brief filed in Supreme Court October 20.

Community Legal Services in East Palo Alto v. HHS — WIN — In a case challenging the Trump administration’s unlawful decision to cut off funding for legal services for unaccompanied children in immigration proceedings, the Ninth Circuit denied the government’s petition for rehearing en banc. The Court addressed—and rejected—the government’s jurisdictional argument. Echoing our brief, the Court understood the Plaintiffs to challenge the government’s failure to comply with the TVPRA’s mandate, rather than raise a breach-of-contract claim. Ninth Circuit, decision rendered October 10.

Grundmann v. Trump — The D.C. Circuit is considering whether Donald Trump’s attempted firing of the Chair of the Federal Labor Relations Authority was illegal. Our brief explains why long-established practice has placed the validity of multimember independent agencies like the FLRA beyond doubt, and also demonstrates that the text and history of the Constitution further underscore the legitimacy of multimember independent agencies. C. Circuit, brief filed October 10.

protected under the Clean Water Act,” Glass said.","Environmental groups warn the proposal to change the definition of “waters of the United States” would eliminate crucial safeguards for “countless” bodies of water.

The Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of the Army on Monday announced a proposal to further define, and scale back, the number of waterways and wetlands protected by the federal government under the Clean Water Act, a bedrock environmental law.

Flanked by supporters, including Republican members of Congress and West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin signed the proposed rule in front of a packed audience at agency headquarters in Washington.

“News of today’s proposal is going to be met with a lot of relief from farmers, ranchers, other landowners [and] governments that have been looking for a simple, prescriptive definition that the whole country can operate off of,” Zeldin said at the signing.

According to a fact sheet released by the agency on Monday, the proposal will impact the government’s definition of “waters of the United States,” commonly referred to as WOTUS, which defines the scope of federal jurisdiction over Clean Water Act permitting.

The proposed rule would exclude groundwater from the definition, and would no longer automatically protect interstate waters.

It would also significantly limit which wetlands and streams are protected under the Clean Water Act, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. According to NRDC, that move would exclude many critical wetlands and seasonal streams that it says are essential for drinking water supplies, flood control and ecosystem health.

In an interview on Monday, RJ Karney, senior director of public policy at the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture, said that the move brings welcome relief to states and the agricultural sector.

“What this came down to was a recognition of ‘cooperative federalism,’” Karney said, referring to a “partnership between the federal government and states in the implementation of federal regulations.”

Karney also said that the proposed rule provides a boost to the agricultural industry by providing clearer definitions that make it easier to understand what bodies of water are or aren’t regulated under the Clean Water Act.

Industry groups similarly lauded Monday’s move as a return to a more state-based approach to water protection regulations.

“We applaud EPA and the [Army Corps of Engineers’] efforts to bring our nation’s job creators one step closer to relief from years of federal government overreach by offering a clear, durable ‘Waters of the U.S. rule,’” said the Waters Advocacy Coalition, whose members represent a variety of industries including mining, fossil fuel and agricultural groups.

However, environmentalists roundly decried the Trump administration’s proposal as a threat to water quality across the nation.

In a statement, the Natural Resources Defense Council said that the proposed rule would “dramatically narrow which waters are covered by federal safeguards, leaving many wetlands and headwaters vulnerable to pollution and destruction.”

“These waters are vital for filtering drinking water, reducing flood and drought risks, and sustaining wildlife—but under the planned rule, many of them would no longer be protected,” the NRDC said.

A geospatial analysis NRDC conducted this year found that between 38 to 70 million acres of wetlands are at risk of pollution or destruction under modeled scenarios similar to the changes included in Monday’s proposal, the group said in its statement.

Jon Devine, director of freshwater ecosystems at NRDC, also pushed back against the idea that states are in a better position to regulate water quality than the federal government.

“There are several things wrong with that claim,” Devine said in an interview with Inside Climate News.

“The first and most obvious is that a lot of waters aren’t contained within a state,” Devine said. “That allows for pollution on one side of a water body, or upstream in a water body, to contaminate folks on the other side or downstream—even if that state has really protective laws.”

Additionally, Devine said that about half of states have no protections outside of federal law—and that even in states with good laws, many of the state agencies that implement them are underfunded and have historically relied on federal agencies to assist with implementation.

For environmental advocates, the Trump administration’s move is the latest in a series of recent blows to the Clean Water Act.

In a ruling earlier this year, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in City and County of San Francisco v. Environmental Protection Agency to limit the EPA’s power to enforce Clean Water Act permits.

And in a 2023 decision in Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency, the court ruled that the EPA’s ability to protect wetlands applied only to those that are indistinguishable from, and have a “continuous surface connection” to larger lakes, oceans, streams and rivers.

To J.W. Glass, EPA policy specialist at the Center for Biological Diversity, Monday’s announcement showed that the administration is willing to step even further beyond the 2023 Supreme Court ruling to restrict the federal government’s role in protecting water quality.

“This is EPA looking at Sackett in the narrowest possible lens, and looking at what a wetland means in the narrowest possible legal lens, in an effort to make sure that the largest swath of wetlands are no longer considered jurisdictional, i.e. protected under the Clean Water Act,” Glass said.

The EPA will accept public comments on the proposed rule for 45 days once it is published in the Federal Register, and is required by law to consider the public’s feedback before finalizing the rule.",https://mavensnotebook.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Upper-Newport-Bay-coastal-wetland-Ken-Lund.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 07:58:54.754658

Based on company research, the U.S. must add more than 1,000 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity within the coming decade to meet rising demand from AI, electrification and industrial growth

LAS VEGAS, Nov. 18, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Schneider Electric, a global energy technology leader, opened the company's Innovation Summit North America 2025 today, convening more than 2,500 business leaders and market innovators representing nearly every industry to accelerate solutions for a more resilient, affordable and intelligent energy future. The two-day summit (November 18–19) features technology showcases, partner announcements and new research designed to help organizations build ahead of demand and unlock new productivity with AI, software and services.

In his keynote address, Schneider Electric CEO Olivier Blum spoke to the evolving energy landscape, highlighting the company's continuing transformation to meet industry demands. He presented a forward-looking vision that further establishes the company's position as an energy technology partner.

Schneider Electric is advancing energy technology, the integration of electrification, automation and digital intelligence, across buildings, data centers, industrial applications and power grids. The company's open, AI-powered EcoStruxure™ Platform creates intelligent ecosystems to drive real-time insights, resilience, and efficiency.

""By converging electrification, automation and digitalization, we unlock the full value of energy, creating efficiency and sustainability for all,"" said Olivier Blum, CEO, Schneider Electric. ""As your dedicated energy technology partner, our role is to translate that vision into concrete solutions that help you rapidly digitalize and strengthen your resilience. Innovation Summit North America is where we bring this to life, moving faster from ambition to action, advancing Energy Tech together with our entire ecosystem of partners and customers.""

North America is entering a new growth cycle driven by AI workloads, re-industrialization and transport electrification. Much of today's infrastructure was not built to handle fast-ramping, highly variable demand, creating a gap between when capacity is needed and when it comes online. According to Schneider Electric's Sustainability Research Institute, grid instability costs U.S. businesses billions annually. The nation must add 1,000–2,000 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity per decade to meet demand from AI computing, manufacturing and electrification (one TWh powers about 90,000 homes for a year). Schneider Electric's call at Innovation Summit North America is for public and private partnerships to address the time to power gap by adding capacity closer to where it's consumed; using software and AI to unlock headroom, reliability and efficiency from existing systems; and modernizing grid operations so energy can be orchestrated at scale.

Decades of government bureaucracy and red tape, overwhelming how, when, where, and how quickly we build in America, has led to Americans’ rising concerns about the affordability of electricity and energy. On Thursday, the House Committee on Natural Resources is holding a markup of the SPEED Act, a permitting reform bill introduced by Reps. Bruce Westerman (R) and Jared Golden (D), that will help ensure we clear the way for energy that is affordable, reliable, and produced in abundance here in America. Here’s how:

The SPEED Act primarily reforms the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review process, a key procedural hurdle that often results in elongated delays for vital energy projects. This bill ensures NEPA reviews have consistent and predictable timelines, clarifies what is deemed a major Federal action to trigger a NEPA review, places reasonable judicial limitations on reviews, and simplifies the entire bureaucratic process.

Americans for Prosperity’s grassroots activists have been at the forefront of this issue during its Road to Prosperity campaign, travelling across the nation to more than half a dozen states, educating voters and lawmakers about why the permitting process needs to be fixed. We’ve visited oil rigs, coal and iron mines, energy processing sites, and more in states from Louisiana to Wyoming.

The SPEED Act markup on Thursday is a great first step to helping unleash prosperity in the form of more, better-paying jobs, reducing the backlog of hundreds of energy infrastructure projects stuck in permitting purgatory, and advancing a policy of energy abundance.

This is an encouraging step toward a policy that can make a real difference. Americans for Prosperity—and millions of Americans—welcome lawmakers’ efforts to pass legislation that will help lower energy costs and power the future for this and future generations.

The company currently operates a smaller magnet manufacturing facility in Research Triangle Park. The new 1 million-square-foot site in Benson represents a major scale-up and is expected to become the largest magnet production plant outside China. Rare earth magnets play a critical role in technologies dependent on electric motors and precision motion systems, including but not limited to electronics, robotics, electric vehicles, data centers, and numerous defense applications.

Capacity

The plant will produce up to 10,000 metric tons of Neodymium Iron Boron magnets each year. This expansion addresses rising demand in advanced manufacturing and strengthens the domestic magnet supply chain.

The state’s Economic Investment Committee approved a Job Development Investment Grant to support the project. Over 12 years, the project is expected to add about $2.6 billion to the state economy. The JDIG allows the company to receive up to $17.58 million if it meets annual job creation and investment targets.

Because Johnston County is a Tier 3 county, the state will allocate up to $5.86 million to the Industrial Development Fund – Utility Account for rural infrastructure. The state may also provide up to $250,000 for road improvements.

The project will create new administrative, engineering, and production jobs, with an estimated annual payroll of $81.9 million. Multiple state and local partners, including the North Carolina Department of Commerce, the Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina, Johnston County, and the Town of Benson, supported the project.

Québec companies are early adopters of clean solutions.
In fact, nearly one in three businesses reported using clean technologies in areas like water, energy, and waste management (Écotech, 2022).
Unmatched (clean) energy costs Québec’s electricity rates are nearly 50% lower than those of Toronto and seven times lower than New York’s.
Attractive financial incentives Federal tax credits for clean electricity, cleantech manufacturing, and hydrogen are available.","Why is cleantech booming?

The momentum is undeniable. Since 2023, Montréal International has supported numerous cleantech and decarbonization projects. We’ve already welcomed projects worth a total of $267 million this year, and it’s not over yet!

Québec companies are early adopters of clean solutions. In fact, nearly one in three businesses reported using clean technologies in areas like water, energy, and waste management (Écotech, 2022). This adoption helps them remain competitive in a rapidly evolving market.

Canada ranks second in the world for cleantech attractiveness, according to the Global Cleantech Innovation Index (2024). Québec stands out with 400 innovative companies and 85,000 jobs in the sector.

Looking forward, Canada is committed to large-scale projects, including the development of our hydroelectric production capacity and boosting eco-friendly transportation options (for instance, Alto). These and other projects were underscored by Prime Minister Mark Carney in various announcements and the most recent federal budget.

Can you define “clean technology”?

Cleantech refers to any product, service, or process designed to assess, prevent, or reduce environmental impacts (Écotech). Key sectors include:

Renewable energies (wind farms, solar panels)

Energy efficiency (heat recovery systems, smart buildings)

Green chemistry (eco-friendly manufacturing, bioplastics)

Sustainable transportation (EVS, charging infrastructure)

Water & waste management (advanced recycling, wastewater treatment)

Why choose Montréal for cleantech investment?

Here are the three most compelling reasons:

1. Unmatched (clean) energy costs

Québec’s electricity rates are nearly 50% lower than those of Toronto and seven times lower than New York’s. Over 99% of our electricity comes from renewable sources. Going forward, Hydro-Québec’s action plan includes major grid upgrades and an additional 8,000–9,000 MW of capacity by 2035, creating significant business opportunities.

2. Attractive financial incentives

Federal tax credits for clean electricity, cleantech manufacturing, and hydrogen are available. Provincial programs like Hydro-Québec’s efficient solutions cover up to 90% of eligible expenses for new equipment purchases or solutions to reduce our energy consumption.

Initiatives such as Technoclimat and Ecoperformance fund decarbonization projects.

3. A thriving ecosystem

Québec-based companies can benefit from the support of Écotech, Propulsion Québec, Réseau Environnement, the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity and other such organizations that foster collaboration across Québec’s ecosystem.

We are also fortunate to have numerous research centres, including the Innovative Vehicle Institute and HEC Montréal’s Chair in Energy sector management.",https://www.montrealinternational.com/app/uploads/2020/03/facebook2.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 11:04:54.875087

On Reddit's r/energy, Texans raved about solar energy in a recent thread.","Texas occupies a unique place on the American energy landscape, something most non-Texans learned during a deadly statewide grid failure amid extreme weather in 2021.

Officially, 246 Texans died during the crisis, but experts believe as many as 814 died.

According to the Energy Information Administration, local grids connect to one of three larger regional interconnections: the Western Interconnection, the Eastern Interconnection, and, in Texas, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas Interconnection.

Texas' functional disconnection from the country's major grids was one of several factors that exacerbated the 2021 grid crisis.

Now, as Houston's KTRK recently reported, more residents of the Lone Star State are considering microgrids as a hedge against an unstable grid.

Microgrids enable the generation and storage of energy within a smaller area. Moreover, as the Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory explains, microgrids can operate in ""island mode,"" ensuring a stable supply of power when main grids fail.

As KTRK noted, microgrids are common in facilities like hospitals and data centers — but a community solar residential microgrid in Florida, a state where extreme weather is prevalent, ensured all 37 connected homes maintained power during a regional outage.

A KTRK anchor explained that microgrids often use renewable, clean energy sources like solar panels, providing continuous power irrespective of the broader grid's status.

""These microgrids are another way to keep the lights on, even in the harshest of conditions or times of peak demand,"" a reporter explained. The anchors alluded to potentially prohibitive costs to establish a fully-fledged microgrid, and KTRK advised Texans to start smaller.

Installing solar panels was one of the first steps the outlet recommended, and home solar is one of the most resilient energy options, particularly when coupled with battery backups. After Hurricane Melissa battered Jamaica, solar-powered locals became a lifeline to neighbors.

As electricity rates soar across the U.S., solar is booming, and The Cool Down's Solar Explorer is designed to make the switch as easy and affordable as possible. Solar panels are the ultimate home energy hack, and they can bring electricity bills down to $0 or even lower.

The Solar Explorer curates competitive bids from vetted local installers and can save homeowners up to $10,000 on new installations. As for upfront costs, the Solar Explorer offers $0 down options like Palmetto's LightReach, allowing users on a budget to lock in low rates. Another program in the Explorer, EnergySage, can further connect you with vetted local installers in many areas of the country.

TCD also has an HVAC Explorer to help people find trustworthy options for a heat pump or other bill-reducing HVAC option that suits their home.

World leaders have gathered in Brazil for the U.N. Climate Conference. The U.S. is not there, but China is. When it comes to energy transition, the U.S. and China couldn't be on more different paths. China is moving away from fossil fuels while the U.S. is doubling down. Experts say this will have consequences for the climate and these countries' economies. NPR sent two correspondents to opposite sides of the Pacific to learn more. We begin with NPR's Julia Simon in Eureka, California.

JULIA SIMON, BYLINE: In far northern California, Chris Mikkelsen drives an old police cruiser past little wooden houses.

Pine trees with moss just, like, hanging off of them.

CHRIS MIKKELSEN: It's just an old seaside town.

SIMON: Mikkelsen is the executive director of the Humboldt Bay Harbor District, which plans to assemble wind turbines for a massive new offshore wind project. About 20 miles off this misty coast, two companies - American Vineyard Offshore and German RWE - plan to build turbines to power more than 2 million homes. Mikkelsen says the project aims to make about 270 long-term local jobs.

MIKKELSEN: It's going to, you know, change the economic viability of our community. And I get a little - my voice gets a little shaky 'cause it's going to make a better opportunity for our kids.

SIMON: Yeah.

MIKKELSEN: That's pretty important.

SIMON: The new terminal was supposed to be shovel-ready as soon as 2026, Mikkelsen says. That's no longer realistic, in part because the Trump administration recently canceled more than $426 million in federal grants for the project. Mikkelsen says it's been pencils down since then as they try to find new sources of money. This is one of dozens of actions this administration has taken to starve the renewable energy industry of federal support from canceling tax credits years early to issuing stop-work orders.

Amanda Levin at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council says the U.S. renewable industry had been growing.

AMANDA LEVIN: For the first time last year, wind and solar produced more electricity than coal. Things were headed in the right direction, but this really just takes the wind out of their sails.

SIMON: The Trump administration is reversing support for renewables, which it incorrectly labels as risky and unreliable. But across the Pacific Ocean, America's biggest competitor - China - thinks otherwise. Let's throw the mic 5,000 miles to NPR's Anthony Kuhn, who's there.

ANTHONY KUHN, BYLINE: You are right, Julia. Here in China, renewable isn't a dirty word. China's leadership has made strategic choices to include renewables in its energy mix. We're in China's Zhangbei region, which is in between the capital Beijing and the edge of the Mongolian Plateau. The area is rich in wind resources, and it's where a lot of China's wind and solar capacity is being installed.

(SOUNDBITE OF TURBINE BLADES SPINNING)

KUHN: Turbine blades swoosh past in huge circles. The electricity goes from here to a grid outside Beijing and on to the rest of China. China now dominates the global renewable sector. In the first half of this year, China built more solar than the rest of the world combined. Seventy-four percent of all large-scale wind and solar projects are being built in China. Compare that to the U.S. that's building 6%. China now has more installed generation capacity from solar and wind than from gas and coal.

It wasn't always this way. Until recently, China's economic growth came at the cost of air pollution from burning fossil fuels. But in the last few decades, authorities in Beijing began to consider a sustainable economic growth model, and renewables have been a key part of that, according to Qin Haiyan, director of the parent company of the wind farm we visited and vice president of the World Wind Energy Association.

QIN HAIYAN: (Through interpreter) Developing the economy and reducing carbon emissions to address climate change are now no longer contradictory.

KUHN: And this, according to the Asia Society's Li Shuo, is the biggest difference between the U.S. and China in climate policy today.

LI SHUO: It couldn't be a stronger contrast between the two countries.

KUHN: In China, solar and wind are now cheaper than coal and gas. Li Shuo says one of the most dramatic aspects of China's climate story is not just that they seem to be cutting their climate emissions...

LI: But also, to what extent other parts of the world can also benefit from China's low-carbon products.

SIMON: So China is now exporting turbines and solar panels and batteries around the world, from Brazil to Nigeria to Pakistan.

KUHN: That's right, Julia. All the renewables growth, both local and exports, is a bright spot amid China's slowing economy, especially its slumping real estate sector. David Fishman is a principal at the Lantau Group in Shanghai.

DAVID FISHMAN: People who used to be swinging hammers building commercial real estate are now swinging hammers installing solar panels. And that - well, yes, of course. You double - triple down on that.

(SOUNDBITE OF WIND BLOWING)

SIMON: Back in Eureka, Mikkelsen walks along a creaky dock, an abandoned pulp mill looming behind us. He says he doesn't understand why the Trump administration would cancel the grants for the terminal supporting the wind project. He says this community has been suffering since 2008 when the pulp mill closed.

MIKKELSEN: Our administration that was recently elected, not only at the presidential level but even some of our Congress and senators, really ran on a platform that we're going to build back America, that we're going to create jobs in rural America - good, skilled, trained, you know, high-paying jobs. And there's no better place. You're looking around, you're seeing the remnants of what once was.

SIMON: It is still unclear what the nationwide cuts to renewable energy mean for U.S. climate emissions.

KUHN: But in China, the climate story is more clear, and it's a rare, encouraging indicator in the global warming story. The growth of renewable energy means that China's emissions seem to be on track to peak or are nearing their peak, Li Shuo says. And China's renewable exports mean the country is helping other countries reduce their emissions too.

SIMON: Jeremy Wallace, professor at Johns Hopkins University, says now, at the end of the day...

JEREMY WALLACE: What America does is part of a story, and it is not the main part of the story. It's a cute side character.

KUHN: China, he says, is now the main character in the story of fighting climate change. Anthony Kuhn, NPR News, Zhangbei County, Hebei Province, China.

“The impact of the Biden-era WOTUS rule would have been far-reaching and costly,” Hoeven said.
We appreciate the EPA finally fixing previous WOTUS rules and supporting America’s family farmers and ranchers,” Wehrbein said.
NCBA explained, “The revised WOTUS rule ensures that only large bodies of water and their main tributaries fall under federal jurisdiction.
“EPA’s new draft WOTUS rule continues to prioritize corporate interests by compromising the already weakened protections for thousands of water bodies across the country,” Foster said.","Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin and Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works Adam Telle, on Monday announced a proposed rule that they said “would establish a clear, durable, common-sense definition of ‘waters of the United States'” (WOTUS) under the Clean Water Act.

EPA has been under pressure for years to write a WOTUS rule because there were conflicting Supreme Court decisions about federal responsibility for waters that cross state lines. Various definitions of WOTUS have been challenged in the courts.

Zeldin and Telle maintained that the new proposed rule “follows the Supreme Court decision in Sackett and delivers on the Trump administration’s commitment to protect America’s waters while providing the regulatory certainty needed to support our nation’s farmers who feed and fuel the world and advance EPA’s Powering the Great American Comeback initiative.”

The agencies said they developed this proposed rule using input from multiple sources, including a pre-proposal recommendations docket, information from nine public listening sessions, and consultation comments from states, tribes and local governments.

The agencies said that “key proposed revisions” include:

“Defining key terms like ‘relatively permanent,’ ‘continuous surface connection,’ and ‘tributary’ to appropriately delineate the scope of WOTUS consistent with the Clean Water Act and Supreme Court precedent;

“Establishing that jurisdictional tributaries must connect to traditional navigable waters either directly or through other features that provide predictable and consistent flow;

“Reaffirming that wetlands must be indistinguishable from jurisdictional waters through a continuous surface connection, which means that they must touch a jurisdictional water and hold surface water for a requisite duration year after year;

“Strengthening state and tribal decision-making authority by providing clear regulatory guidelines while recognizing their expertise in local land and water resources;

“Preserving and clarifying exclusions for certain ditches, prior converted cropland, and waste treatment systems;

“Adding a new exclusion for groundwater; and

“Incorporating locally familiar terminology, such as “wet season,” to help determine whether a water body qualifies as WOTUS;

“In addition, the limitation to wetlands that have surface water at least during the wet season and abut a jurisdictional water will further limit the scope of permafrost wetlands that are considered to have a continuous surface connection under the proposed rule. These proposed changes are intended to provide clarity and consistency to the continuous surface connection definition.”

The proposed rule will be published in the Federal Register and open for public comment for 45 days. EPA and the Army will host two public meetings, both in-person and online.

Details about commenting either in writing or during a public meeting can be found on EPA’s website. “The agencies look forward to reviewing public comment while working to expeditiously develop a final rule,” a news release said.

REACTIONS

Congressional Republicans and farm and manufacturing leaders praised the rule while congressional Democrats, the Waterkeeper Alliance and the Chesapeake Bay Foundation criticized it.

House Agriculture Committee Chairman Glenn “GT” Thompson, R-Pa., said, “For too long, WOTUS allowed Washington to overreach into the everyday work of farmers, ranchers and landowners.”

“Today’s action is a strong step in finally delivering a clear, practical definition that ends the needless permitting headaches created by the Biden-era rule,” Thompson said.

“By following through on a promise to rural America, Administrator Zeldin is restoring certainty and trust where it’s long been needed.”

Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman John Hoeven, R-N.D., noted that he had fought against what he called the “regulatory overreach” of the Biden and Obama administrations, but was also cautious in his reaction, urging North Dakotans to submit comments on the rule.

“The impact of the Biden-era WOTUS rule would have been far-reaching and costly,” Hoeven said.

“Our farmers, ranchers and energy producers, among many others, would have been bogged down in federal permitting for everyday activities, imposing an unworkable regulatory burden and inflating not only their operating costs, but ultimately prices for consumers.”

“That’s why I worked to hold back this regulatory overreach under the Biden and Obama administrations and support the Trump administration in advancing a WOTUS definition that respects private property rights and the regulatory role of states. I appreciate Administrator Zeldin for working with us on this priority, and I encourage North Dakotans to submit their feedback to the EPA to ensure the final rule meets the needs of our state,” Hoeven said.

“We are pleased that the new rule protects critical water sources while respecting the efforts of farmers to protect the natural resources they’ve been entrusted with,” said American Farm Bureau Federation President Zippy Duvall.

“The Supreme Court clearly ruled several years ago that the government overreached in its interpretation of what fell under federal guidelines,” Duvall said.

“We are still reviewing the entire rule, but we are pleased that it finally addresses those concerns and takes steps to provide much-needed clarity.”

The National Cattlemen’s Beef Association announced support for the rule.

“Waters of the U.S. has been a longstanding and frustrating issue for family farmers and ranchers,” said NCBA President Buck Wehrbein, a Nebraska cattleman.

“Every few years, the definition of a ‘water of the U.S.’ has changed. Often, this meant that small water features like prairie potholes or dry ditches suddenly fell under federal regulation.”

“NCBA has spent years fighting to protect cattle producers from excessive red tape. We went to the EPA, advocated on Capitol Hill, and even took this issue all the way up to the Supreme Court to protect our members from federal overreach. We appreciate the EPA finally fixing previous WOTUS rules and supporting America’s family farmers and ranchers,” Wehrbein said.

NCBA explained, “The revised WOTUS rule ensures that only large bodies of water and their main tributaries fall under federal jurisdiction. Past WOTUS rules issued under the Obama and Biden administrations placed small, isolated water features under federal regulation. Prairie potholes, playa lakes, and even ditches that only carried water after large storms became regulated as if they were a large lake, river or ocean.”

American Soybean Association President Caleb Ragland, a Kentucky farmer, said, “Soybean farmers have been asking for a WOTUS definition we can actually put to work on the ground.”

“For too long, shifting interpretations have created real uncertainty about whether everyday decisions might trigger federal oversight,” Ragland said.

“We appreciate that the administration, along with Administrator Lee Zeldin and Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works Adam Telle, is moving toward a definition that reflects how water interacts with working farmland and respects the conservation practices growers already use.

“Aligning the rule with the Supreme Court’s Sackett decision and preserving long-standing exemptions for normal farm work gives producers clearer expectations and reduces the risk of costly delays or compliance surprises,” Ragland said.

National Council of Farmer Cooperatives President and CEO Duane Simpson said, “NCFC supports this effort to streamline permitting, reduce unnecessary red tape, and ensure that water regulations are both clear and workable for stakeholders, including agriculture.”

“Farmer co-ops and their members are committed to protecting our natural resources, and today’s action is a meaningful step toward giving them the certainty required to keep doing just that while continuing to power rural economies,” Simpson said.

The leaders of the House Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition, said, “Trump’s Polluted Water Rule will leave us with weaker clean water protections than we’ve had since the 1980s, allowing polluters free rein over our nation’s waters.”

“This reckless decision by the EPA — the agency with a mission to protect human health and the environment — now puts the drinking water supplies of millions of Americans at risk.”

“Clean drinking water is a necessity, not a privilege, and we’ve learned today just how far Trump’s EPA will go to ignore the health and safety of our families and communities,” the coalition said.

“When the American people turn on their taps to find dirty drinking water in the years to come, they can point to Donald Trump and Lee Zeldin. The EPA needs to wake up and remember its reason for existing, instead of selling out our clean water to Trump’s highest bidder.”

National Association of Manufacturers President and CEO Jay Timmons said, “Manufacturers thank EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin for listening to the concerns of our industry and revising the definition of the Waters of the United States rule to bring certainty and predictability.”

“For too long, the regulatory structure under the WOTUS rule, which often has included shifting and unclear definitions, has created legal uncertainty for manufacturers in the U.S.,” Timmins said, “undermining our ability to invest and build across the country. Understanding which bodies of water require federal oversight under the Clean Water Act is critical for manufacturers planning new projects.”

Waterkeeper Alliance said it was “sounding the alarm” about the rule.

“The Clean Water Act has already been severely weakened following the Supreme Court’s 2023 decision in Sackett v. EPA, in which the court dramatically revoked protections for thousands of bodies of water across the country,” the group said.

“Every rollback threatens the water we drink, the rivers we fish, and the wetlands that protect our communities and ecosystems,” said Kelly Hunter Foster, senior attorney for Waterkeeper Alliance.

“EPA’s new draft WOTUS rule continues to prioritize corporate interests by compromising the already weakened protections for thousands of water bodies across the country,” Foster said.

“This isn’t abstract policy, it’s a deliberate decision that disregards the real consequences for people’s health, safety and daily lives. Waterkeeper Alliance will keep fighting for the clean water that we all need and deserve.”

Chesapeake Bay Foundation Senior Policy Director Keisha Sedlacek said, “EPA’s plan to further strip wetlands protections would deal a serious blow to Bay restoration.”

“Wetlands, including those isolated from other waters, and streams that don’t flow continuously all year are critical to clean water in the Bay and its local rivers and streams,” Sedlacek said.

“They also provide habitat and spawning grounds for fish, waterfowl, and wildlife important to our region’s seafood and outdoor recreation industries. And they’re invaluable for softening the blow of extreme weather on low-lying communities like Annapolis and Norfolk.

“Absent robust federal protections, the Bay states and D.C. must fill the gaps or risk losing wetlands and streams that help save the Bay to short-sighted and irresponsible development and destruction,” Sedlacek said.",https://swiftmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/mountain.swiftcom.com/images/sites/12/2016/09/05123726/FarmlandValue-RFP-042913-1-3.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 07:58:59.208409

Tuesday, the Montana Public Service Commission heard recommendations from legal and regulatory staff on the case filed by NorthWestern Energy.
The Public Service Commission’s rules “emphasize the importance” of evaluating, managing and mitigating risk through “transparency and documentation,” the report said.
It said a “glaring example” of how its application failed regarding transparency and documentation involves the costs of potential alternatives to the Yellowstone plant.
The Public Service Commission is expected to take up the Yellowstone plant portion of the case at a meeting on Wednesday.","NorthWestern Energy didn’t adequately evaluate more affordable options before it built the Yellowstone County Generating Station, and it “knew it was making a risky decision” to build the plant, according to Public Service Commission legal and regulatory staff.

The monopoly utility also didn’t manage risks in a cost effective way, and it likely could have avoided $45 million in cost overruns, said the staff report.

As such, staff recommend the Public Service Commission exclude those costs from the amount NorthWestern can recover from customers in a pending rate case.

“Staff concludes that there were significant deficiencies in the planning and procurement processes that raise serious doubts about whether NorthWestern minimized total costs and risks for customers,” said Public Service Commission staff.

Tuesday, the Montana Public Service Commission heard recommendations from legal and regulatory staff on the case filed by NorthWestern Energy.

Public Service Commissioners did not take up a decision on the Yellowstone County Generating Station.

However, commissioners heard details from a staff report that outlined the ways NorthWestern Energy misstepped in selecting and building the methane-fired plant in Laurel, estimated at $320 million, as it evaluated its options to supply electricity to customers

In briefings, the Montana Consumer Counsel, a group of conservation organizations, a coalition of large businesses, and federal agencies agreed NorthWestern should not get to foist onto others the expenses that were the result of, as one party put it, the utility’s “lack of cost discipline.”

In the Public Service Commission staff report, analysts said NorthWestern botched the process to evaluate “the full range of cost-effective resource options” in the first place. It eliminated at least one viable option without explanation or justification, the report said.

The report also said NorthWestern never demonstrated that the Yellowstone County Generating Station “achieves the lowest long term total cost for customers.”

For example, the report said NorthWestern knew battery capacity paired with reciprocating internal combustion engine units would be low cost and low risk, but it conducted its request for proposals in a way that prevented that pairing in its cost analysis.

The analysts pointed to other problematic factors in the way NorthWestern evaluated its options, such as including the Yellowstone plant in 27 of the 36 different resource portfolios it designed, but including the “lowest-cost resource” on the shortlist in just one portfolio.

NorthWestern had resource offers that would have “entirely avoided” the risks and subsequent cost overruns to build the plant, the staff report said.

And it said NorthWestern clearly knew of the risks because it cited them when it withdrew its application for preapproval of the Yellowstone project by the Public Service Commission.

The report also said NorthWestern didn’t provide nearly enough information about the construction of the plant and its evolution, as the agency requires.

The Public Service Commission’s rules “emphasize the importance” of evaluating, managing and mitigating risk through “transparency and documentation,” the report said.

But it said NorthWestern didn’t provide any documentation to explain the reason the expected costs for the plant had increased when it terminated an agreement with one contractor and executed another, nor did it document a rationale for replacing its contractor.

In fact, the report said analysts agree with Renewable Northwest, a party that participated in the case and argued NorthWestern didn’t make its case the plant was a needed investment.

“NorthWestern has continually failed to meet its burden of demonstrating that YCGS represents a prudent investment, or to furnish the commission with sufficient data to verify that fact for itself,” the staff report said, citing Renewable Northwest.

It said a “glaring example” of how its application failed regarding transparency and documentation involves the costs of potential alternatives to the Yellowstone plant.

Over the course of nine months, NorthWestern was asked to provide the information about cost multiple times, but it failed to do so until the day the hearing started — a move that deprived the Public Service Commission and other parties of “essential information” and violated state regulations, the report said.

The staff report also said NorthWestern tried to earn a return on a portion of the Yellowstone plant that should be depreciated, which does not comply with “regulatory accounting fundamentals,” and staff recommended an adjustment accordingly.

“Staff’s recommendation would reduce NorthWestern’s proposed $287 million YCGS rate base, associated with 16 engines in use, to $227.7 million,” the report said.

The Public Service Commission is expected to take up the Yellowstone plant portion of the case at a meeting on Wednesday.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-89/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/methane-plant-3.1-1-1024x7671763517127.jpg?h=ddb1ad0c&itok=eVQ26uxN,N,,2025-11-18 22:58:00.045793

As the U.S. market evolves, Toyota’s hybrid bet may prove to be a winning hand in an uncertain game.","In the rapidly evolving landscape of the U.S. automotive market, Toyota Motor Corp. is making a bold statement with its continued emphasis on hybrid vehicles. As electric vehicle (EV) adoption faces headwinds from infrastructure challenges and shifting consumer preferences, the Japanese automaker is investing heavily to expand its hybrid production capacity. This strategy comes at a time when hybrids are gaining traction, offering a bridge between traditional internal combustion engines and full electrification.

Recent announcements underscore Toyota’s commitment. On November 18, 2025, the company revealed plans to invest $912 million across five U.S. manufacturing plants in southern states, aimed at boosting hybrid component and vehicle output. This move is part of a larger $10 billion investment pledge in the U.S. over the next five years, as reported by TechCrunch. The investment will create 252 new jobs and enhance production lines for hybrid engines and components, signaling Toyota’s confidence in hybrids as a dominant force in the near term.

Toyota’s approach contrasts with rivals who have pivoted aggressively toward all-electric lineups. While companies like Ford and General Motors grapple with slowing EV sales, Toyota’s multi-pathway strategy—encompassing hybrids, plug-in hybrids (PHEVs), and battery electric vehicles (BEVs)—has proven resilient. According to data from Toyota’s disclosures, electrified models accounted for 46.9% of its U.S. sales in the third quarter of 2025, outperforming the industry average.

Scaling Up Hybrid Production

The $912 million investment targets facilities in Alabama, Kentucky, Missouri, Tennessee, and West Virginia. For instance, Toyota’s Alabama plant will receive $282 million to produce hybrid transaxles, while the Kentucky facility gets $145 million for engine production lines. This expansion is expected to come online gradually, with some projects not fully operational until 2027, as detailed in a report by Bloomberg.

Beyond immediate production boosts, Toyota is shifting key models to U.S. manufacturing. The company plans to move production of the hybrid Corolla from Japan to its Indiana plant, a strategic decision to localize supply chains amid global trade tensions. This aligns with broader industry trends where automakers are reshoring operations to mitigate risks from tariffs and supply disruptions.

Toyota’s executives have been vocal about their hybrid-first philosophy. “We believe in a multi-pathway approach to electrification,” said Jack Hollis, executive vice president and chief operating officer of Toyota Motor North America, in a statement cited by CNBC. This stance is backed by sales figures: Toyota reported 2,332,623 U.S. vehicle sales in 2024, with electrified vehicles driving a 3.7% year-over-year increase, according to the Toyota USA Newsroom.

A Response to Market Realities

The push for hybrids comes as EV enthusiasm wanes in the U.S. With the potential expiration of federal tax credits and concerns over charging infrastructure, consumers are increasingly opting for hybrids, which offer fuel efficiency without the range anxiety of pure EVs. Posts on X (formerly Twitter) reflect this sentiment, with users praising Toyota’s pragmatic strategy amid reports of vanishing EV demand.

Industry analysts note that Toyota’s hybrid dominance stems from decades of investment in the technology, starting with the Prius in 1997. By 2030, Toyota aims to increase PHEV sales to 20% of its U.S. volume, up from 2.4% last year, as per sources in a CNBC article. This target reflects a calculated bet on consumer preferences, especially in segments like pickup trucks and SUVs where hybrids are gaining popularity.

Competitive pressures are also at play. Rivals such as Hyundai and Honda are expanding their hybrid offerings, but Toyota maintains a market lead with models like the RAV4 Hybrid and Camry Hybrid. A report from Electrek highlights Toyota’s upcoming wave of new hybrid, PHEV, and EV models, positioning the company to capture diverse market segments.

Broader Investment Commitments

Toyota’s $10 billion U.S. investment plan, announced just a week before the hybrid-specific funding, encompasses electrification, advanced manufacturing, and job creation. This follows a pattern of substantial commitments; in May 2025, Toyota outlined plans to scale PHEVs significantly, as covered by AInvest. The strategy has drawn investor attention, with Q3 2025 sales data showing strong demand for electrified vehicles.

Financially, Toyota is thriving. The company reported robust Q2 2025 results, with significant growth in operating income and sales revenues attributed to vehicle sales and innovations, according to Investing.com. This financial health enables aggressive investments, contrasting with EV-focused competitors facing losses on battery-powered models.

On X, discussions emphasize Toyota’s foresight. Posts from industry figures like Car Dealership Guy highlight the brand’s calculated moves, such as adding hybrid options to iconic models like the 4Runner, reflecting a shift toward hybrid-only lineups in the future.

Challenges and Criticisms

Despite the optimism, Toyota’s strategy isn’t without critics. Some argue it’s overly conservative, potentially leaving the company behind in the long-term race to full electrification. Environmental advocates push for faster EV adoption to meet climate goals, pointing out that hybrids still rely on fossil fuels.

However, Toyota counters with innovations like solid-state batteries, which could revolutionize both hybrids and EVs. As Brian Sullivan noted on X in 2024, Toyota’s hybrid focus combined with battery development positions it well until infrastructure catches up.

Regional challenges also loom. A Accio analysis from May 2025 discusses Toyota’s global dominance amid rising hybrid demand, but notes U.S.-specific hurdles like tariff tensions. Toyota’s investments aim to navigate these by bolstering domestic production.

Looking Ahead to 2030

As Toyota ramps up hybrid production, the industry watches closely. The company’s ability to blend hybrid reliability with emerging EV technologies could define the next decade of automotive electrification. With half of its U.S. sales already electrified—double the industry share—Toyota is poised for growth.

Investor sentiment remains positive, as evidenced by posts on X praising Toyota’s $14 billion battery push for hybrids. This investment, detailed in a Wall Street Journal piece referenced in social media, underscores a pivot from EV hype to practical solutions.

In the words of Toyota’s leadership, this is about meeting consumer needs today while preparing for tomorrow. As the U.S. market evolves, Toyota’s hybrid bet may prove to be a winning hand in an uncertain game.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/article-1700-1763510835.jpeg,N,,2025-11-18 22:58:12.233929

Dougherty for tour of Greenfield Manufacturing warehouse. Tour highlights environmental and cost-saving benefits of large-scale rooftop solar on warehouses and distribution centers across the state.

Philadelphia, PA – State Senators Nikil Saval and Carolyn Comitta, State Rep. Dougherty, and Solar States joined PennEnvironment for a rooftop solar tour at Greenfield Manufacturing, a warehouse in Northeast Philadelphia with an extensive rooftop solar installation. The tour highlighted the immense potential for solar energy generation on warehouse rooftops, an under-utilized space for solar panels. A recent PennEnvironment study found that if all of the warehouses in Pennsylvania added solar to their roofs it would generate enough electricity to power more than 820,000 homes and significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

“Warehouses have immense solar energy potential, and can be a key component in moving Pennsylvania towards more clean, renewable energy generation,” said Belle Sherwood, PennEnvironment Clean Energy Advocate. “Putting solar panels on Pennsylvania’s warehouses would be good for communities, good for the electricity grid, and most importantly, good for our environment,”

Pennsylvania Senators Nikil Saval and Carolyn Comitta have proposed legislation that would help unlock the solar energy potential of warehouses and distribution centers across the state by requiring all new warehouses and distribution centers constructed in Pennsylvania be “solar-ready”. The senators’ legislation would also provide a tax credit for existing warehouses and distribution centers to make the necessary retrofits to be considered solar-ready.

“We have the technology we need right now to arrest climate change, advance a green and prosperous economy, and make life healthier, safer, and more affordable for working people and communities throughout Pennsylvania, and our built environment plays a key role,” said State Senator Nikil Saval. “If we harness the energy-generating capacity of the more than 500 million square feet of suitable rooftop space that sits atop warehouses across our commonwealth, we could power nearly a million households per year on solar energy alone.”

“Warehouses, distribution centers, and commercial buildings account for a significant portion of our carbon emissions. Meanwhile, they can be ideal sites for solar panels,” said State Senator Carolyn Comitta. “As the growth of e-commerce continues to drive warehouse development in Pennsylvania, this legislation can help ensure that they are ready to harness the economic, environmental, and public health benefits of solar energy.”

Greenfield Manufacturing is already seeing the benefits of their rooftop solar array. Their 3,600 panel system, installed by Solar States last year, generates more than 100% of the warehouse’s energy needs. They’re able to return any excess solar energy back to the grid, helping to alleviate the strain on the electricity grid and make their energy bills negative. Greenfield gets over $1,000 for their solar power production each month.

Greenfield Manufacturing is located in Pennsylvania Representative Sean Dougherty’s state house district in northeast Philadelphia. He says, “my neighbors are seeing energy costs increase exponentially because of energy-intensive warehouses popping up across Northeast Philadelphia. I’m proud to co-sponsor Solar Warehouses (HB 1260 sponsored by Rep. Josh Siegel) because it allows clean energy to be generated in-house, at their OWN warehouse. This will reduce the cost of electricity for everyone in our neighborhood.”

Advocates note that there’s never been a better time for businesses to invest in solar energy, since the cost of solar has decreased significantly over the past decade. It’s estimated that the cost of utility-scale solar decreased by 90 percent between 2009-2020.

“We have a 4.5 billion year-old nuclear reactor in the sky that is raining down energy on us every day,” said Micah Gold-Markel. “If we don’t use it, it’s a waste.”",https://environmentamerica.org/pennsylvania/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/SocialCardEnviroC4_PAE.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 00:59:09.113888

Waterkeeper Alliance will keep fighting for the clean water that we all need and deserve.”","The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Army Corps of Engineers released a proposed new waters of the U.S. (WOTUS) rule on Monday.

According to official documentation, the proposed rule is intended to “provide greater regulatory certainty and increase Clean Water Act program predictability and consistency by clarifying the definition of “waters of the U.S.” There will be a public comment period on the proposal for 45 days after it is published in the Federal Register.

The proposed rule has pleased agricultural groups, but environmental groups are “sounding the alarm” about it. Here’s a closer look.

Agricultural Groups

American Farm Bureau Federation

The American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) is the nation’s largest farmer-run organization and serves farmers in all 50 states.

On Monday, AFBF President Zippy Duvall commented on the rule.

“Clean water is a top priority for farmers and ranchers — we depend on it. We are pleased that the new rule protects critical water sources while respecting the efforts of farmers to protect the natural resources they’ve been entrusted with.

“The Supreme Court clearly ruled several years ago that the government overreached in its interpretation of what fell under federal guidelines. We are still reviewing the entire rule, but we are pleased that it finally addresses those concerns and takes steps to provide much-needed clarity. We look forward to providing comments to EPA to ensure farmers can continue to safeguard the environment while growing the food America’s families rely on.”

American Soybean Association

The American Soybean Association (ASA) represents U.S. soybean farmers on domestic and international policy issues. ASA has 26 affiliate state associations representing 30 soybean-producing states and nearly 500,000 soybean farmers.

The ASA “applauded” the EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for their proposed rule in a statement Monday.

“Soybean farmers have been asking for a WOTUS definition we can actually put to work on the ground,” said Caleb Ragland, ASA President and Kentucky farmer. “For too long, shifting interpretations have created real uncertainty about whether everyday decisions might trigger federal oversight. We appreciate that the administration, along with Administrator Lee Zeldin and Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works Adam Telle, is moving toward a definition that reflects how water interacts with working farmland and respects the conservation practices growers already use. Aligning the rule with the Supreme Court’s Sackett decision and preserving long-standing exemptions for normal farm work gives producers clearer expectations and reduces the risk of costly delays or compliance surprises.”

The statement ended noting, ""ASA will review the proposal in detail, but this is an important step toward providing farmers the predictability they need to manage their land responsibly and keep delivering food, feed, and fuel for America and the world.""

National Association of State Departments of Agriculture

The National Association of State Departments of Agriculture (NASDA) is a nonpartisan, nonprofit association which represents the elected and appointed commissioners, secretaries, and directors of the departments of agriculture in all 50 states and four U.S. territories.

NASDA commented Monday, stating the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers have “duly recognized states’ expertise in managing and protecting local land and water resources.”

“NASDA appreciates EPA listening to input from state departments of agriculture and other stakeholders regarding problems with prior WOTUS rulemakings. NASDA is pleased that our federal colleagues are now working cooperatively with state co-regulators to ensure the goals of the Clean Water Act are met while minimizing unjustified interference with agricultural and other activities that feed, clothe, and house Americans and drive our nations’ economy,” NASDA CEO Ted McKinney said.

“NASDA is excited to properly re-engage with EPA under cooperative federalism to ensure our local water resources are protected and farmers have the information and resources they need to make the best decisions about how to manage their land.”

""NASDA will continue to review the proposed rule and intends to offer detailed comments in due course,"" the statement concluded.

The National Cattleman’s Beef Association (NCBA) has represented America's cattle producers since 1898 and is the largest association of cattle producers in the U.S.

NCBA announced support for the rule Monday in a statement.

“[WOTUS] has been a longstanding and frustrating issue for family farmers and ranchers. Every few years, the definition of a ‘water of the U.S.’ has changed. Often, this meant that small water features like prairie potholes or dry ditches suddenly fell under federal regulation,” said NCBA President and Nebraska cattleman Buck Wehrbein. “NCBA has spent years fighting to protect cattle producers from excessive red tape. We went to the EPA, advocated on Capitol Hill, and even took this issue all the way up to the Supreme Court to protect our members from federal overreach. We appreciate the EPA finally fixing previous WOTUS rules and supporting America’s family farmers and ranchers.”

“Today's WOTUS announcement finally acknowledges that the federal government should work to protect lakes, rivers, and oceans, rather than regulating ditches and ponds on family farms and ranches,” said NCBA Chief Counsel Mary-Thomas Hart. “NCBA is pleased to see the EPA stand up for cattle producers, and we look forward to providing input on this proposed rule.”

According to the statement, “NCBA and its state affiliate partners will submit comments to the agency on the rule, which will be considered before the rule is finalized.”

Waters Advocacy Coalition

The Waters Advocacy Coalition (WAC) is made up of farmers, homebuilders, manufacturers, and other job creators. The group released the following statement Monday in response to the rule.

“We applaud EPA and the Corps’ efforts to bring our nation’s job creators one step closer to relief from years of federal government overreach by offering a clear, durable [WOTUS] rule. WAC strongly endorses the agencies’ commitment to respect the legal boundaries articulated by the Supreme Court and to restore the balance Congress intended more than 50 years ago when it enacted the Clean Water Act.

“The Waters Advocacy Coalition represents America’s job creators who deliver the services families rely on every day; from producing energy [and] building homes and infrastructure, to growing food. These industries need regulations they can understand. We look forward to more closely analyzing the proposal and offering comments to ensure that this rule protects America’s waterways while offering certainty to landowners throughout the country.”

Environmental Groups

National Wildlife Federation

The National Wildlife Federation (NWF), America's largest and most trusted conservation organization, works across the country to unite Americans from all walks of life in giving wildlife a voice.

In a statement Monday, NWF said the rule would “protect fewer streams and wetlands from pollution and destruction than at any point since the law’s passage in 1972.”

“We’ve forgotten that we have clean water because of the Clean Water Act,” said Jim Murphy, the NWF’s senior director of legal advocacy. “This rule would further strip protection from streams that flow into the rivers and lakes that supply our drinking water. The wetlands now at risk of being bulldozed filter our water supplies and protect us from floods.

“Revoking these long-standing protections will hit families in their pocketbooks by raising water treatment costs and home insurance rates. This rule will increase the risk of elevated nitrates and cyanotoxins in drinking water, harming our health. Over time, the impacts to water quality, wildlife, and our way of life will be significant. The crisis facing aquatic wildlife will deepen and it will become harder to find places to fish, boat, and swim.”

Waterkeeper Alliance

Waterkeeper Alliance is a global movement united for clean, healthy, and abundant water for all people and the planet.

The group released a statement Monday “sounding the alarm” about the draft rule.

“Every rollback threatens the water we drink, the rivers we fish, and the wetlands that protect our communities and ecosystems,” said Kelly Hunter Foster, Senior Attorney for Waterkeeper Alliance. “EPA’s new draft WOTUS rule continues to prioritize corporate interests by compromising the already weakened protections for thousands of water bodies across the country. This isn’t abstract policy, it’s a deliberate decision that disregards the real consequences for people’s health, safety, and daily lives. Waterkeeper Alliance will keep fighting for the clean water that we all need and deserve.”",https://www.agriculture.com/thmb/8aSWOKeQrC5hO8s9UvffnZBSeWI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/49445657561_b1fcbfbcec_o-ec05e784dff44a8498ec134555cf02c3.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 21:59:22.989683

The Cheap Energy Act The Cheap Energy Act is a statement of Democratic priorities, some of which include permitting.","Rising energy costs, stalled transmission lines, and clean energy projects under threat of cancellation: The need for permitting reform has never been more apparent. Yet, despite broad agreement that America’s build-out has slowed to a crawl, the political will to act remains elusive. Lawmakers in both parties continue to talk about modernizing our outdated permitting system, and this fall has seen a surge in new bills promising to do just that. But for all the legislative activity, it isn’t obvious that meaningful permitting reform will pass during this Congress. If we’re ever going to move beyond modest, technocratic tweaks, we’ll need to take a hard look at what’s truly necessary to build faster, to ensure credible and effective environmental review, and to get something passed.

The political challenges are well understood at this point. Democrats remain wary of efforts to overhaul the National Environmental Policy Act, a cornerstone of the regulatory system. They worry that narrowing judicial remedies or procedural rules could result in significant environmental harm and silence public input. And in light of partisan acrimony and the Trump administration’s attacks on solar and wind energy, Democrats are nervous that permitting reform initiatives might fail to protect renewable energy, undercutting their climate policy preferences. Meanwhile, Republicans are skeptical of federal efforts to streamline transmission siting and planning, which they view as a backdoor to the wind-and-solar-heavy energy policy ambitions of the Biden administration. And both parties, with some justification on each side, continue to accuse the other of energy tribalism. Despite the momentum behind permitting reform, these sources of skepticism from both parties remain significant barriers to an eventual deal.

Committee dynamics compound these political divides. Two House and two Senate committees share jurisdiction over permitting and must coordinate to get anything through. Each committee prioritizes its interests. No chair can carry a comprehensive deal alone. But coordination efforts across committees are few and difficult. In the Senate, minority Democrats hold considerable negotiating leverage over legislation that emerges from the Environment and Public Works Committee, which has jurisdiction over changes to NEPA. Meanwhile, the Energy and Natural Resources committee controls transmission issues. Any comprehensive deal will require both committees to be aligned and members of both parties to be on board.

The politics and substance of permitting reform have come a long way. Despite a seemingly paralyzed legislature, Congress is full of serious, well-developed ideas for fixing our broken system. The ePermit Act, which would modernize data sharing and digitize environmental reviews, stands out as popular, sensible, and achievable. And the SPEED Act, while flawed, is a disciplined policy proposal, reflecting a growing recognition that NEPA reform can’t simply mean repeal. With the Cheap Energy Act, the SPEED & Reliability Act, and the Fix Our Forests Act, Democrats as well as Republicans have begun to reckon with the depth of the nation’s environmental regulatory problems.

Permitting reform has never looked more plausible. But there remain significant substantive and political hurdles between introduced legislation and a successful, meaningful bipartisan deal. Clearing these hurdles would not only boost the prospects of reform this session, but could ideally initiate a legislative flywheel of regular environmental regulatory reform for Congress to pursue for years to come.

The SPEED Act

The Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act, introduced by House Natural Resources Chairman Bruce Westerman (R-AR) and Rep. Jared Golden (D-ME), is the most sweeping and talked-about proposal this fall. It correctly identifies the core problems—drawn-out reviews and obstructive litigation—and aims to address them through major changes to judicial review and the environmental review process itself.

These impulses are admirable. But by functionally eliminating how courts can enforce NEPA and loosening requirements agencies must follow, the bill risks weakening the very incentives that make environmental review credible in the first place. By eliminating courts’ ability to stop projects, the SPEED Act would remove the backstop that ensures agencies take their statutory obligations seriously. Without the teeth of enforcement, compliance could become optional, and the quality of review would likely erode. While it’s hard to predict, the consequences would likely extend beyond NEPA itself. Claims under other statutes, like the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act, are often litigated alongside NEPA. Neutering NEPA litigation could push more litigation toward these statutes.

A better approach would preserve a narrow but real role for the courts, enough to keep agencies honest without inviting endless litigation. The discretion SPEED offers to eliminate meaningful review could create a whipsaw of NEPA guidance from administration to administration, creating confusion for the courts and uncertainty for developers.

Successful reform would provide a voice, not a veto, to the public and other stakeholders. It would strengthen the public engagement process, require agencies to seriously consider comments, and then restrict judicial remedies that serve as veto points later in the process. One additional reform that deserves attention, though it’s received less discussion, is consolidating NEPA litigation in a single federal court. Centralized review could create precedent, shorten timelines, and end the inconsistent rulings that slow projects nationwide.

Whatever its merits, SPEED is unlikely to pass the Senate as written. Both the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) and the Energy and Natural Resources committees (ENR) are drafting their own visions for permitting reform and do not see SPEED as the starting point. Even though SPEED has Democratic House co-sponsors, its reforms are likely more aggressive than Senate Democrats wielding the filibuster would accept. As of this writing, Chairman Westerman is soliciting potential amendments on the bill. We’ll see how this shifts the dynamics in the ongoing negotiations.

Fix Our Forests Act

The Fix Our Forests Act offers a compelling contrast to SPEED. Reps. Bruce Westerman (R-AR) and Scott Peters (D-CA) introduced FOFA in the House, and Sen. John Curtis (R-UT) introduced it in the Senate with bipartisan co-sponsors including Tim Shelly (R-MT), Alex Padilla (D-CA), and John Hickenlooper (D-CO). FOFA’s judicial reforms strike a sensible balance between cutting down on litigation and doing so in a way that preserves agencies’ incentives to prepare adequate NEPA analyses. Specifically, in the Senate version, FOFA’s judicial reforms limit but don’t eliminate the circumstances under which a court can stop a fireshed management project subject to NEPA. FOFA also forces judges to consider the purpose and likely effectiveness of the project before granting project-stopping relief. And finally, FOFA reduces the timeframe for filing claims covered by the Act from six years to 150 days.

The fact that FOFA’s narrower, carefully negotiated bipartisan package represents the Senate’s ceiling for agreement signals that SPEED’s judicial reforms, which would functionally eliminate courts’ ability to stop projects, go too far to pass the Senate.

While FOFA would be a clear victory for permitting reform if it passes, there are ramifications to advancing it alone. Pulling forest management out of the broader permitting debate risks draining momentum for more comprehensive NEPA reform. Democrats are more comfortable reforming NEPA to address wildfires but reluctant to open bedrock environmental statutes to broader revision. Without forest management as an impetus for NEPA reform, the Democrats’ willingness to engage in broader reform may dwindle. One possible solution would be to expand the judicial review provisions in FOFA to cover a broader set of infrastructure projects outside forestry.

ePermit Act

A bill from Reps. Scott Peters (D-CA) and Dusty Johnson (R-SD), the ePermit Act, focuses on modernizing the administrative process of permitting rather than changing the substance of environmental review laws. Rather than getting caught in partisan debates over statutory reform, the bill finds bipartisan footing in the low-hanging fruit of technology and communications modernization. Updated technology and interagency communications capacity could, without additional reforms, make the current permitting process faster, more transparent, and easier to navigate.

While other bills seek to rewrite NEPA itself, ePermit aims to improve how it works. Standardizing data, improving interagency coordination, and increasing public visibility into project reviews would resolve government-wide inefficiencies while improving transparency and accountability. The ePermit Act could and should pass in something like its current form, almost no matter how the broader permitting negotiations proceed.

The SPEED & Reliability Act

Initially introduced in 2024 and reintroduced this year by Rep. Scott Peters (D-CA) and Andy Barr (R-KY), the SPEED & Reliability Act would update how major transmission lines are approved. The 2025 version keeps the same goal of improving grid reliability but scales back federal authority over siting and cost-sharing in an effort to make the bill more appealing to Republicans. It moves away from the cumbersome National Interest Electric Transmission Corridor (NIETC) process by giving FERC greater permitting authority. But it does not grant the clear, centralized authority that is likely necessary to expedite review and resolve interstate siting conflicts.

Despite bipartisan sponsors, the politics of this bill remain difficult. Expanding federal siting authority has little traction in the current Congress, and Republican hesitation to move meaningfully on transmission leaves few paths forward. Discussions often stop short of significant reform, settling instead on so-called “grid enhancing technologies” (GETs). These upgrades can help utilities squeeze more capacity from existing infrastructure, but they don’t replace the need to build new high-voltage lines. These make the grid smarter, not bigger. Without a broader shared interest in policies that would expand construction and coordination, the SPEED & Reliability Act has little chance of making it to the House floor.

The Cheap Energy Act

The Cheap Energy Act is a statement of Democratic priorities, some of which include permitting. The bill also covers clean energy tax credits, energy efficiency, and other subjects. While the GOP holds Congress, this bill likely won’t see further legislative action this session.

Introduced by Reps. Mike Levin (D-CA) and Sean Casten (D-IL), co-chairs of the SEEC Clean Energy Deployment Task Force, the Act would expand FERC’s authority over transmission and—like the ePermit Act—invest in permitting and data capacity to make the NEPA process more transparent and predictable.

The bill matters less for what it would build than for what it signals. For years, Democrats have centered energy debates on climate goals and belatedly focused on the practical need to make power cheaper. Hence, Democrats made a late shift from “Build Back Better” to the “Inflation Reduction Act” before the law passed in Summer 2022. The Cheap Energy Act marks a clear rhetorical shift toward affordability and reliability; it does not emphasize emissions reductions. Still, much of the bill includes subsidies and spending that echo earlier legislative efforts. With no Republican support and the Senate focused on different approaches to energy policy, this bill serves primarily as a useful if symbolic Democratic signal rather than viable legislation.

The Complete Package

Both parties agree that permitting is too slow and fractured, but they often differ on what fixing it would entail. Republicans want to scale back NEPA and limit lawsuits; Democrats often see those changes as going too far, weakening environmental safeguards and community input. The politics of permitting follow a familiar pattern. It’s easy to tweak the process around the edges, but it’s much harder to change the rules that make it slow in the first place.

On the surface, the ePermit Act appears to fit this pattern. But it should not be misunderstood as a modest reform. It would overhaul the archaic systems of the federal government for implementing NEPA, a vast organizational undertaking. Even still, it probably wouldn’t move as a stand-alone bill. But it could be attached to a must-pass package, possibly the Surface Transportation Board reauthorization, which is due before September 2026.

The Fix Our Forests Act also has a path forward. Its balanced approach to judicial reform shows that it is possible to accelerate projects without delaying environmental review. While passing as a standalone bill could complicate broader reform later, forest permitting is an urgent and achievable step. A large share of NEPA litigation concerns forest management projects. And new research from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory finds that replacing transmission lines and wires after wildfires is one of the most significant factors driving rising energy costs in the American West.

The SPEED Act faces slim odds of reaching cloture in the Senate in its current form. But it has five Democratic co-sponsors and may have the momentum to pass the House. Both Senate committees are drafting their own bill text, which may emerge as wholly new legislation or form the basis for revising SPEED.

To work, SPEED would need to restore a narrow role for courts to keep agencies accountable. It would also need to raise the statutory floor for public comment, facilitating early public engagement that helps agencies and developers avoid challenges to their projects later in the process. SPEED should also codify Seven County with greater fidelity. In Seven County, the Supreme Court gave agencies discretion not to analyze effects “separate in time or place” from the project itself. SPEED tells agencies that may not consider those effects, even if they want to. Lawmakers working on SPEED should consider borrowing from the Fix Our Forest Act, whose judicial review framework strikes a better balance—speeding up approvals without eliminating accountability. Adopting that model would help preserve a narrow but real enforcement backstop that keeps agencies honest without inviting endless litigation.

Markup of the SPEED Act in the House is expected in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, Senate EPW and ENR are both drafting bill language for companion bills, though neither has released text. EPW’s approach is likely to contain elements of Senator Capito’s RESTART Act of 2024, which would have established deadlines for court review and agency NEPA work, among other procedural changes. A successful bipartisan deal would hammer out a consensus on the various judicial review provisions under consideration, ideally one that opens up a compromise space for future reforms to other environmental statutes like the National Historic Preservation Act and the Endangered Species Act.

The politics of permitting reform have advanced considerably in recent years, and they represent an encouraging exception to the hyperpartisan gridlock that characterizes many other issues. Getting the policy details right matters, not only for passing meaningful reforms this Congress, but for compounding the political momentum for years to come.",https://thebreakthrough.imgix.net/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/PermittingFall.png?mtime=1763502545,N,,2025-11-19 00:59:25.223232

Shrinking the map Energy companies stand to benefit if the Trump administration finishes its version of the regulation, Hannah Northey reports.","The health of American streams and wetlands factors into almost any project that will gobble up acreage — from metal mines to suburban subdivisions to golf courses and data centers.

And for decades, many of those waterways have enjoyed an extra layer of protection after regulators designated them “waters of the U.S.”

On Monday, developers got a big win from the Environmental Protection Agency and Army Corps of Engineers, which proposed a regulation that would sharply winnow down the number of water bodies receiving that federal scrutiny, Annie Snider writes.

Arcane questions about whether Clean Water Act protections apply to a river, creek, bog or marsh that serves as a source of drinking water or restrains flood waters or filters out pollution have — like so much else — become political hot buttons. Supporters of the proposal say the traditionally broad definition has led to federal overreach, making it harder and more expensive to do construction or discharge pollution.

Environmental interests say broad federal protections are essential for protecting a precious resource. But a series of bewildering Supreme Court rulings has left the line between federally protected and unprotected waters in flux.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said Monday that the new proposal is “a clear, simple, prescriptive rule that will withstand the test of time.”

“My goal right from the onset was to come up with a definition that — no matter what would happen in November of ’28 or November of 2032 — that you’re going to keep this definition,” Zeldin said, referring to the next two presidential elections. “This wasn’t about taking a pendulum and swinging it as far as you can up against another edge.”

The proposal comes two years after the Supreme Court narrowed the scope of the protections under the 1972 landmark law. Industry groups were sharply critical of how the Biden administration handled the decision, saying the definition of U.S. waters was still too broad.

Shrinking the map

Energy companies stand to benefit if the Trump administration finishes its version of the regulation, Hannah Northey reports.

Opening the door to more domestic mining from copper in Arizona to coal in Appalachia has been a White House priority. The administration has opened more public land to mining, fast-tracked permitting and taken private equity stakes in companies to boost production.

Former regulators and analysts say shrinking the regulatory map could help.

The price would be that miners seeking to dump dredge into waterways or dig up metals in sensitive headwaters will probably face fewer federal limits. And states with far weaker protections would be left to jump into the breach.

COP Corner

Speeding ahead: Brazil is pushing to gather countries Wednesday to decide on key issues, such as adaptation, finance and boosting ambition at the U.N. climate summit in Belém, according to the latest letter by COP30 President André Aranha Corrêa do Lago. Among the top issues is a call by a coalition of developing countries to triple the funding that helps them withstand the effects of a hotter world.

Trade is another unresolved issue. India and other developing countries take issue with the EU’s upcoming carbon tariff. Options on the table range from more technical talks on climate-related trade measures to setting up an annual debate assessing policies such as the European measure. The EU has made clear it rejects attempts to turn the U.N. talks into a space to resolve trade issues.

Push to abandon fossil fuels: Dozens of governments are calling for countries to agree on a “roadmap” for phasing out coal, oil and natural gas, writes Zack Colman. The call from 82 countries spanning Europe, the Pacific islands, Latin America and Africa immediately elevated the topic to the top of the COP30 agenda, making it one of the most substantial and likely divisive topics of the two-week negotiations.

The effort seeks to put teeth in a bold but nonbinding pledge from the 2023 climate summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, in which nearly 200 nations agreed to begin “transitioning away from fossil fuels.” Missing from the list of supporters: the United States, the world’s top oil and gas producer, which is skipping COP30 entirely.

China makes bank: With Trump slamming the door on clean energy, Beijing is sending the message at COP30 that it’s open for business, Zack writes. China’s section of the climate summit’s main hall features 5-foot-tall poster boards boasting of the country’s battery and electrical projects. BYD, the crown jewel of China’s world-leading electric vehicle empire, is an official sponsor of the summit, as is fellow Chinese electric car manufacturer GWM.

And while Beijing has 789 delegates at the summit — behind only Brazil, the host country — the official U.S. delegation has consisted solely of Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.).

Request denied

Trump denied disaster aid to thousands of Chicago residents after two devastating storms this summer, writes Thomas Frank.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency documented extensive damage from the July and August storms, projecting more than $129 million in recovery costs for residents. But Trump denied the aid requests from Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker on Oct. 22, two weeks after saying the Democratic governor and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson (D) “should be in jail” for “failing to protect” federal immigration enforcement officers.

White House spokesperson Abigail Johnson answered questions about Trump’s denials by highlighting Illinois’ status as a sanctuary state for undocumented immigrants.

Pritzker “should know how to balance his budget for these types of repetitive losses,” Johnson said in a statement, referring to damaging storms, “but instead prioritizes the state’s budget for illegals over Americans.”

Nuclear sticker shock

Utilities aren’t inking contracts to build new nuclear plants despite Trump’s push for a nuclear revival, write Brian Dabbs and Francisco “A.J.” Camacho.

“I wouldn’t build a nuclear plant,” Calvin Butler, CEO of Exelon, a major U.S. utility that doesn’t produce power but is aiming to do so in the future, told CNBC last week. “What I could do is lean in on combined-cycle gas turbines. What I could do is build community solar. What I could do is own battery storage.”

That hesitation is throttling the Trump administration’s plans to reassert U.S. nuclear leadership globally and power an artificial intelligence boom. America’s nuclear fleet is aging, with many of the country’s 94 reactors near retirement.

House Bill 1260, sponsored by Rep. Josh Siegel, D-Lehigh, known as the Solar Warehouses bill, advanced to the House floor with amendments. If enacted, the bill would require newly constructed warehouses and distribution centers to be built to accommodate solar panels and encourage existing warehouses to be retrofitted for them through a tax incentive.

The House Energy Committee previously held a public hearing on the bill in October.

“It is crucial for Pennsylvania to lead when it comes to lowering costs for our residents,” Siegel said. “H.B.1260 incentivizes warehouses to be built solar-ready, which not only will help keep energy prices lower by adding capacity to the grid, it also will add good paying jobs to our economy.”

While China came to dominate the supply chain in batteries, solar energy equipment and electric vehicles, it has also resulted in massive overcapacity, or as the Chinese like to call it, ‘involution’. Involutionary competition, although a recurring phenomenon in the Chinese economy, has impacted it severely this time due to a combination of several factors.

Chinese regulators have introduced anti-involution policies to address the deteriorating situation. These measures are often compared to supply side reforms in the previous decade but they represent a distinct approach, and are implemented in a different context. For this time, the policies are focused on setting quality and safety standards for products, testing requirements, maximising R&D spending, and implementing stricter Intellectual Property rights as well as labour laws.

Potential efficacy of anti-involution measures

Current measures to limit outputs in the new energy sector are likely to take longer than previous supply-side reforms to consolidate the market. This is mainly due to the dominant share of privately-owned enterprises in these sectors, specifically EVs, batteries and solar. As opposed to regulating state-owned enterprises that followed the directive to slash outputs in the previous reforms, POEs will be more sensitive to market pressure and will require incentives to follow the set caps, and might revert to competitive pricing to survive longer. Another implication that is highly likely to follow this consolidation is massive job losses as second and third tier firms are pushed out of the market. The private sector is responsible for a large number of additional employment generated annually.

Furthermore, local governments that are used to incentives based on increasing manufacturing output, are highly indebted, and dependent on private sector enterprises for revenues are also likely to resist or delay directly reducing outputs or industrial consolidation. Local governments affected the most by a decline in land revenues have invested heavily in building these manufacturing clusters as means to generate revenues in the form of tax and social contributions.

Firms dealing with overcapacity

While China’s central leadership strives to push industry consolidation, companies have been trying to survive as well as come up with innovative products to distinguish themselves amid fierce competition. The most impacted by such price wars, especially in the battery manufacturing segment, are the second and third tier producers. Firms with a dominant share in the market or Tier-1 firms can absorb losses for a longer period, surviving until the market consolidates, and yet innovate with new technologies. The producers with smaller shares however, which mainly rely on price competitiveness rather than product differentiation will find it difficult to absorb losses.

In the case of lithium-ion batteries, China today supplies over 75% of batteries sold globally and has witnessed a 30% drop in battery prices in the year 2024 alone. This price drop is a result of two factors, decreasing cost of lithium and high price competition amid tier-2 suppliers. The country has installed over 2 TWh of production capacity in 2024, which is already 60% higher than the demand. With this gap, the Li-ion battery industry in China is bound to face the impact of ‘involution’.

The case of Li-ion batteries is similar to those of EVs- too many players, and too much capacity resulting in shrinking margins for second and third tier suppliers. Major suppliers like CATL have managed to remain profitable due to their larger share in the market. Tier 1 suppliers produce nearly 50% of the total battery cells in China. Reportedly, CATL’s gross profit margins increased between 2023-24 despite the fall in battery prices during thisperiod. Similarly, EVE energy has also remained relatively stable. Leading firms therefore, are likely to emerge stronger from the domestic consolidation efforts due to their continued focus on R&D, cost efficiency along with technologically advanced products.

As competitive pressures increase, smaller players will be squeezed out. Meanwhile, safety standards in batteries are increasingly being compromised to achieve cost efficiency by smaller players. This is one of the reasons for setting higher quality standards and testing requirements by the regulators to eliminate lower quality and low-cost products.

The current scenario represents closing avenues for Chinese enterprises wherein domestic demand remains stagnant, and domestic markets flooded while major export markets are increasingly imposing duties on Chinese products in the new energy sectors. Additionally, the Chinese government has introduced controls that affect investments to manufacture outside of countries and restrict technology transfer. Such restrictions even hamper the growth of the enterprises that survive from the involutionary competition.

Window of opportunity

Between 2020 and 2025, prices of Li-ion batteries have dropped 80%, stripping companies of their profits. As Chinese enterprises undergo ‘involutionary’ pressures, and restrictions at both home and abroad, it presents an opportunity for producers outside China to reclaim their share in global markets by forging partnerships. While leading suppliers from China are likely to emerge stronger after the implementation of anti-involution policies, they will be eager to invest in foreign markets to retain their position.

It might take a longer time for the anti-involution policies to yield results as they pertain to setting product standards

and strengthening patent regulations, it could replace the unexpected price cuts from Chinese firms for global markets with price stability in sectors, especially EV and Li-ion batteries. The deflationary pressures in the Chinese economy can also be used to navigate and negotiate for concessions in the export controls on concerned sectors such as advanced lithium-ion batteries, and technologies used to produce lithium-ion cells.

Prior to the imposition of export controls, Chinese firms have been partnering with Southeast Asian firms extensively. Gotion High-tech has partnered with Vietnam’s VinES to jointly build a lithium iron phosphate battery plant, and CATL is also collaborating with the state-owned Indonesia Battery Corporation to build a battery production facility. For Chinese firms to successfully capture export markets, joint ventures and partnerships are becoming a necessary tool as countries demand them to invest in their economies and some form of technology transfer rather than simply furthering import dependence on China.

Progress on partnerships between Indian and Chinese companies in EV and battery manufacturing has been limited due to regulatory uncertainties in both countries. Exide batteries, for instance, entered an agreement with SVOLT energy to use and commercialise its lithium-ion cell manufacturing technology in 2022. Recently, Exide has also secured a deal to supply LFP batteries for Hyundai EVs in the Indian market. Viewing such partnerships involving transfer of technology as a threat to China’s dominance in the market, the Chinese government had reportedly advised EV companies against transferring advanced EV technology and investing in countries like India and Turkey that can later become competitors. Pressure from firms facing thinning profit margins at home could compel China to reconsider this position.

“Being good corporate citizens in Michigan requires data centers to do their fair share to transition the state to clean, affordable energy.","LANSING, MI – In a letter to the board of the Michigan Strategic Fund (MSF), environmental and utility watchdog groups are requesting revisions of recently released guidelines for data center tax exemptions that do not currently comply with Michigan law.

The Michigan Environmental Council, NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council), Sierra Club, and Citizens Utility Board of Michigan in a letter drafted on their behalf by Troposphere Legal point out that MSF’s current guidelines for enterprise data center tax exemptions do not adequately enforce the clean energy requirements enshrined in Michigan state law.

MSF’s guidelines currently state that an enterprise data centers comply with tax exempt status by merely contracting with a utility provider that is subject to Michigan’s clean energy regulatory framework. This is an incorrect interpretation of the law.

Michigan’s Tax Act clearly states that to satisfy clean energy requirements for tax exemptions, applicants must prove that their data center facility has procured—or will procure within six years—90 percent of their power from clean and renewable energy sources as defined in Michigan’s Clean and Renewable Energy Act.

In order to adequately meet the 90 percent clean energy requirement data centers must work with Michigan utilities to procure additional clean energy to power their operations.

Statements from MEC, NRDC, Sierra Club, and CUB leaders:

“Michigan lawmakers created a clear standard: If a data center wants a tax break, it must show it will run on 90 percent clean energy. But this interpretation creates a massive loophole,” said Derrell Slaughter, Michigan policy director, Climate & Energy, NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council). “Without clear and firm language to enforce the clean energy provisions, the standard becomes something companies can evade, and the costs and consequences land on Michigan communities and ratepayers. The board should close this loophole and ensure these large new customers strengthen our clean energy goals rather than weaken Michigan’s ability to meet them.”

“The MSF’s current interpretation creates a loophole big enough for any data center to walk through, one that undermines Michigan’s nation-leading clean energy laws,” said Tim Minotas, Sierra Club Michigan’s legislative & political director. “As energy-hungry data centers expand into our state, MSF must correct these guidelines to conform with Michigan’s values and our clean energy requirements.”

“Across the country, data centers are prolonging the life of expensive, dirty fossil fuel power plants or leading to the build out of more. Michigan’s legislature clearly recognized the threat of energy intensive data centers to our climate and acted to ensure the onus was on data centers to power their operations with 90 percent clean energy,” said Charlotte Jameson, chief policy officer for the Michigan Environmental Council. “Being good corporate citizens in Michigan requires data centers to do their fair share to transition the state to clean, affordable energy. We urge the Strategic Fund Board to correct their guidance, which currently renders the law’s 90 percent clean energy requirement meaningless and undermines Michigan’s clean energy future.”

“Without strong enforcement of the laws, data centers could cause Michigan ratepayers to be saddled with new dirty energy sources for decades,"" said Amy Bandyk, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board of Michigan. ""The Strategic Fund Board must close this loophole to protect both consumers and the future of Michigan's energy economy.”",https://www.nrdc.org/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-18 21:59:16.490667

“Clean water protections shouldn’t change with each administration,” said Betsy Southerland, former director of the Office of Science and Technology in the US Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Office of Water.
Wetlands provide critical wildlife habitats, replenish groundwater, control flooding, and protect clean water by filtering pollution.
“This is one of the most significant setbacks to clean water protections in half a century,” she said.
""Many waters that have been protected by the Clean Water Act for over 50 years would lose those protections under this proposal.""","Environmental justice campaigners on Monday said the Trump administration's latest rollback of wetland protections was ""a gift to developers and polluters at the expense of communities"" and demanded permanent protections for waterways.

“Clean water protections shouldn’t change with each administration,” said Betsy Southerland, former director of the Office of Science and Technology in the US Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Office of Water. “Every family deserves the same right to safe water, no matter where they live or who’s in office.”

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin proposed changes to the rule known as ""Waters of the United States"" (WOTUS), which has been the subject of debate and legal challenges in recent decades. Under the Trump administration, as in President Donald Trump's first term, the EPA will focus on regulating permanent bodies of water like oceans, lakes, rivers, and streams.

The administration would more closely follow a 2023 Supreme Court decision, Sackett v. EPA, which the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) found this year would remove federal protections from 60-95% of wetlands across the nation.

The Zeldin rule would eliminate protections for most wetlands without visible surface water, going even further than Sackett v. EPA in codifying a narrower definition of wetlands that should be protected, said the Environmental Protection Network (EPN). The rule comes after pressure from industry groups that have bristled over past requirements to protect all waterways.

Wetlands provide critical wildlife habitats, replenish groundwater, control flooding, and protect clean water by filtering pollution.

The Biden administration required the Clean Water Act to protect “traditional navigable waters, the territorial seas, interstate waters, as well as upstream water resources that significantly affect those waters,"" but was constrained by the Sackett ruling in 2023.

“This proposed rule is unnecessary and damaging, and ignores the scientific reality of what is happening to our nation’s water supply.""

Tarah Heinzen, legal director for Food and Water Watch, said the new rule ""weakens the bedrock Clean Water Act, making it easier to fill, drain, and pollute sensitive waterways from coast to coast.""

“Clean water is under attack in America, as polluting profiteers plunder our waters—Trump’s EPA is openly aiding and abetting this destruction,"" said Heinzen. “This rule flies in the face of science and commonsense. Eliminating protections from small streams and wetlands will mean more pollution downstream—in our drinking water, at our beaches, and in our rivers.""

The ""critical functions"" of wetlands, she added, ""will only become more important as worsening climate change makes extreme weather more frequent. EPA must reverse course.""

Leda Huta, vice president of government relations for American Rivers, added that the change to WOTUS will ""likely make things worse for flood-prone communities and industries dependent on clean, reliable water.""

“This proposed rule is unnecessary and damaging, and ignores the scientific reality of what is happening to our nation’s water supply,” said Huta. ""The EPA is taking a big swipe at the Clean Water Act, our greatest tool for ensuring clean water nationwide.”

The proposal was applauded by the National Association of Manufacturers, whose president, Jay Timmins, said companies' ""ability to invest and build across the country"" has been ""undermined"" by the Obama and Biden administration's broader interpretation of WOTUS.

But Southerland said Zeldin's proposal ""ignores decades of science showing that wetlands and intermittent streams are essential to maintaining the health of our rivers, lakes, and drinking water supplies.""

“This is one of the most significant setbacks to clean water protections in half a century,” she said. ""It’s a direct assault on the clean water Americans rely on.”

Drew Caputo, vice president of litigation for lands, wildlife, and oceans at Earthjustice, said the group was evaluating the legality of the proposal and would ""not hesitate to go to court to protect the cherished rivers, lakes, streams, and wetlands that all Americans need and depend on.”

""The proposal avoids specifying the exact scale of the deregulation it proposes, but it clearly would result in a serious reduction in legal protections for waters across the United States,"" said Caputo. ""Many waters that have been protected by the Clean Water Act for over 50 years would lose those protections under this proposal.""",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=62206821&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C476%2C0%2C477,N,,2025-11-18 21:59:29.756306

Based on company research, the U.S. must add more than 1,000 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity within the coming decade to meet rising demand from AI, electrification and industrial growth

LAS VEGAS, Nov. 18, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Schneider Electric, a global energy technology leader, opened the company's Innovation Summit North America 2025 today, convening more than 2,500 business leaders and market innovators representing nearly every industry to accelerate solutions for a more resilient, affordable and intelligent energy future. The two-day summit (November 18–19) features technology showcases, partner announcements and new research designed to help organizations build ahead of demand and unlock new productivity with AI, software and services.

In his keynote address, Schneider Electric CEO Olivier Blum spoke to the evolving energy landscape, highlighting the company's continuing transformation to meet industry demands. He presented a forward-looking vision that further establishes the company's position as an energy technology partner.

Schneider Electric is advancing energy technology, the integration of electrification, automation and digital intelligence, across buildings, data centers, industrial applications and power grids. The company's open, AI-powered EcoStruxure™ Platform creates intelligent ecosystems to drive real-time insights, resilience, and efficiency.

""By converging electrification, automation and digitalization, we unlock the full value of energy, creating efficiency and sustainability for all,"" said Olivier Blum, CEO, Schneider Electric. ""As your dedicated energy technology partner, our role is to translate that vision into concrete solutions that help you rapidly digitalize and strengthen your resilience. Innovation Summit North America is where we bring this to life, moving faster from ambition to action, advancing Energy Tech together with our entire ecosystem of partners and customers.""

North America is entering a new growth cycle driven by AI workloads, re-industrialization and transport electrification. Much of today's infrastructure was not built to handle fast-ramping, highly variable demand, creating a gap between when capacity is needed and when it comes online. According to Schneider Electric's Sustainability Research Institute, grid instability costs U.S. businesses billions annually. The nation must add 1,000–2,000 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity per decade to meet demand from AI computing, manufacturing and electrification (one TWh powers about 90,000 homes for a year). Schneider Electric's call at Innovation Summit North America is for public and private partnerships to address the time to power gap by adding capacity closer to where it's consumed; using software and AI to unlock headroom, reliability and efficiency from existing systems; and modernizing grid operations so energy can be orchestrated at scale.

Automakers have urged Trump and lawmakers in Congress to renew the deal, citing decades of business integration across North America.","Washington — The CEOs of all three Detroit automakers have been invited to publicly testify before Congress on Jan. 14 for the first time in more than 17 years.

The last congressional hearing that featured the top executives of Ford Motor Co., General Motors Co. and Stellantis NV (formerly Chrysler LLC) was in late 2008, when concurrent financial and automotive crises were beginning to crash down on the global, national and Michigan economies.

U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, announced the upcoming meeting Tuesday evening via a press release. Cruz is chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. He said the hearing will be titled ""Pedal to the Policy: The Views of the American Auto Industry on the Upcoming Surface Transportation Reauthorization.”

The hearing, if all invitees attend, will feature testimony from Ford's Jim Farley, GM's Mary Barra and Stellantis' Antonio Filosa. Tesla, Inc. Vice President of Vehicle Engineering Lars Moravy was also invited to round out the panel of top U.S. automaker executives.

The hearing will touch on fuel economy regulations, vehicle affordability, a bumpy transition to electric vehicles and more.

Commerce Committee Republicans, in a press release, framed the meeting as an opportunity to examine ""how radical global warming regulations and mandated technologies have driven up the cost of vehicles for American consumers.""

Cruz said in a statement: “Americans have been clear that they are hyper-focused on affordability — and so is this committee. The average price of a car has more than doubled in the past decade, driven up by onerous government-mandated technologies and radical environmental regulations.""

The average price of a new vehicle — including light-duty cars and trucks — pushed past $50,000 for the first time in September, according to Cox Automotive. Price tags hovered around $32,500 a decade earlier, per Cox.

Erin Keating, Cox's executive analyst, explained that trend as a mix of factors.

""It is important to remember that the new-vehicle market is inflationary. Prices go up over time, and today’s market is certainly reminding us of that. While there are many affordable options out there, many price-conscious buyers are choosing to stay on the sidelines or cruising in the used-vehicle market,"" she wrote in an Oct. 14 analysis.

Keating continued: ""Today’s auto market is being driven by wealthier households who have access to capital, good loan rates and are propping up the higher end of the market. Tariffs have introduced new cost pressure to the business, but the pricing story in September was mostly driven by the healthy mix of EVs and higher-end vehicles pushing the new-vehicle (average transaction price) into uncharted territory.""

Cruz suggested that Republicans, since they gained control of Washington earlier this year, have pulled policy levers to bring prices down.

""The One Big Beautiful Bill Act took crucial steps to drive costs down with the repeal of the EV mandate and (corporate average fuel economy) standards, but we must do more,"" he said. ""This hearing will examine how government interference continues to make vehicles expensive and out of reach for American customers and how we can restore competition and choice.”

The January session could give Republican and Democratic lawmakers a rare chance to ask executives of the country's largest retail business sector about company plans and how federal policymaking affects them. U.S. Sen. Gary Peters, D-Bloomfield Township, sits on the committee, as does Republican Ohio U.S. Sen. Bernie Moreno.

The freshman lawmaker from the Buckeye State, who has been influential in automotive policymaking this year, previously amassed a personal fortune running and selling car dealerships.

The meeting will also come as negotiations ramp up over a mandatory review of the United States-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement that President Donald Trump signed during his first term in office. The countries must agree to a renewal by July 1 or reach alternative arrangements. If they do not, the key regional trade deal will lapse.

Automakers have urged Trump and lawmakers in Congress to renew the deal, citing decades of business integration across North America.

Even though it has been a generation since the Detroit Three sent all three of their CEOs to publicly speak with lawmakers on Capitol Hill, the automakers have been active in Washington.

Company executives lobbied Trump directly on tariffs earlier this year and visited him at the White House in 2017 during the Republican president's first term.

“We deserve democracy. Democracy over our water solutions,” Armon Alex, member of Gulf of Mexico Youth Climate Summit, said.

Jake Hernandez with the Texas Campaign for the Environment echoed those concerns.

“The desalination project is a bad deal for residents, no matter the cost,” Hernandez added.

The Inner Harbor Desalination Project had been paused in September after city leaders raised questions about funding and environmental impacts. On Tuesday, the proposal returned to the city council agenda, with City Manager Peter Zanoni presenting it as a plan that comes at no direct cost to the city.

“Water conservation and reuse should be the first alternatives considered by the City of Corpus Christi or any other water providers when evaluating additional sources of water for the community and industry,” Texas Coastal Bend Chapter of the Surfrider Foundation member, Neil McQueen, said during Tuesday's press conference.

The mayor of Taft and program director of Chispa Texas, Elida Castillo, echoed the concerns.

“This is not what’s going to impact us now, but also for the future. We are concerned about desalination. We are concerned about the quality of water in our bays. They have not tested that water,” Castillo said.

Neighbors have also showed support for those living near the Inner Harbor and Hillcrest-Washington Coles neighborhoods.

Mona Lyttle, a Hillcrest resident and member of the Hillcrest Resident Association spoke during the press conference as well.

“We in Hillcrest, we are saying ‘no’ to desal, from the beginning, to the end, to our last breath,"" Lyttle said.

“It takes our community to stand up and say what is happening in Hillcrest is not okay. Because if it’s going to happen there, it will happen to your neighborhood eventually,"" Alex mentioned to Neighborhood News Reporter, Alexis Scott.

The project, initially introduced as a long-term solution to Corpus Christi’s water supply challenges, has faced criticism for its potential environmental effects, cost, and impacts on surrounding communities.

The project will prioritize South Carolina vendors and suppliers, creating sustained demand for local businesses.
South Carolina gains transformative first-mover advantage: while the 10 new reactors require years for siting and permitting, VC Summer can deliver power sooner, positioning South Carolina as the anchor of America’s nuclear renaissance.
South Carolina has a chance to turn a painful chapter into a success story.
It’s the deal South Carolina needs.","South Carolina stands at a crossroads. Our state faces surging electricity demand driven by population growth, advanced manufacturing and data center expansion.

Meanwhile, two partially built nuclear reactors at V.C. Summer in Fairfield County have sat dormant since July 2017. The Santee Cooper board’s unanimous decision on Oct. 24 to enter final negotiations with Brookfield Asset Management to sell and complete those reactors with private capital changes everything.

This proposed deal transforms an abandoned liability into a strategic asset. It delivers 2,200 megawatts of reliable baseload power without asking taxpayers for another dime, positioning South Carolina as the national leader in America’s nuclear resurgence.

Nuclear power remains the only reliable, scalable energy source capable of meeting our state’s growing needs. While wind and solar have their place, they cannot provide the around-the-clock baseload power that manufacturers, data centers and households depend on. As China accelerates nuclear deployment and states like Texas and Tennessee expand their energy portfolios, South Carolina cannot afford to sit on the sidelines.

The Westinghouse AP1000 reactor design represents a quantum leap in safety. It features passive safety systems that rely on gravity and natural circulation rather than pumps, meaning the reactor can safely shut down and cool itself even during complete power loss. This eliminates vulnerabilities that led to accidents like Three Mile Island and Fukushima. If power systems fail, physics itself takes over, with water naturally flowing downward to cool the reactor core, and heat naturally rising to dissipate through the containment structure. No human intervention, electricity or backup generators needed.

The deal itself has been thoroughly de-risked. Since July 2017, Westinghouse has successfully delivered six AP1000 units worldwide, including Georgia’s Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which now power more than 1 million homes. Fourteen more units are under construction in China. Construction efficiencies improved 30% between Vogtle’s third and fourth units, and the design is fully licensed by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission until 2046.

Critically, Santee Cooper has maintained V.C. Summer in good condition since 2017, keeping the site among the best-preserved nuclear assets globally. We’re not starting from scratch; we’re finishing what we started.

The financial structure protects South Carolina ratepayers while securing massive benefits. Brookfield’s proposal includes a multi-billion-dollar ratepayer relief package and provides Santee Cooper with percentage ownership and power share through a structure that delivers below-market electricity rates without equity investment or project-level financial risk.

Brookfield brings extraordinary resources: approximately $1 trillion in assets under management, including $500 billion invested in U.S. infrastructure. As majority owner of Westinghouse, Brookfield uniquely aligns capital, technology and execution expertise. The company is negotiating with major tech companies for long-term power purchase agreements at premium rates, ensuring stable revenues while guaranteeing that Santee Cooper’s customers receive power at below-market rates.

Beyond electricity generation, Brookfield’s investment will rebuild South Carolina’s nuclear workforce and strengthen the state’s manufacturing ecosystem. The project will prioritize South Carolina vendors and suppliers, creating sustained demand for local businesses. Through partnerships with trade schools and universities, Brookfield will establish comprehensive training pipelines for nuclear technicians, welders and engineers.

This commitment to workforce development will revitalize the Midlands economy and position South Carolina as a hub for high-tech manufacturing and nuclear research. The ripple effects will extend far beyond Fairfield County, creating opportunities for the next generation of South Carolinians in careers that didn’t exist when the project was first conceived.

.

The completion of V.C. Summer’s two reactors also creates powerful synergies with the $80 billion initiative to build 10 additional AP1000 reactors nationwide recently announced by the Trump Administration. South Carolina gains transformative first-mover advantage: while the 10 new reactors require years for siting and permitting, VC Summer can deliver power sooner, positioning South Carolina as the anchor of America’s nuclear renaissance.

The alternative is leaving 2,200 megawatts of potential capacity on the table while competitors surge ahead. South Carolina has a chance to turn a painful chapter into a success story. The Brookfield-Santee Cooper partnership delivers reliable power, protects ratepayers, creates jobs, requires no new taxpayer funding and positions our state as a national energy leader. That’s not just a good deal. It’s the deal South Carolina needs.

Starting as a part-time donation attendant, Martinez persevered through challenges, including time spent incarcerated, to become a regional turnaround manager, an achievement he attributes to Goodwill’s focus on leadership development and grace.

Martinez now helps other leaders thrive, informed by his own experience of being given a second chance.

“My whole journey, I look now and say that Goodwill didn’t just change the direction of my life, they gave me a space to create a new life,” Martinez said. “It’s one thing to be gainfully employed; it’s another to have a career, and to me, that is humbling.”

For Martinez, who was under pressure to find a job after his release from prison, Goodwill provided the foundation for a career.

Stephanie Bell, Goodwill’s customer experience manager, noted that Goodwill took a chance on Martinez, who lacked traditional references and job history. Today, as a regional turnaround manager, Martinez mentors store teams, teaching what he learned: that success is about growth and measurable improvement, not perfection.

“The biggest one is grace,” Martinez said. “Goodwill has given that to me. … I’ve been allowed to make mistakes and take that and learn.”

Gary Smith, Goodwill’s chief mission officer, sees Martinez’s transformation as proof of the organization’s model.

“Anthony came to Goodwill and needed help,” Smith said. “Now, he’s helping all the managers that he’s been working with day to day. It’s an amazing transformation.”

Martinez’s ascent from the donation line to managing one of the largest stores in Denver and, now, consulting other leaders was fueled by key skills from Goodwill’s programs: leadership development and a deep understanding of individual capabilities and self-awareness.

Martinez’s story aligns with the goal of Goodwill’s new Clean Tech Accelerator, which aims to address the mismatch between available jobs and in-demand skills in Colorado.

“The biggest thing is we’re partnering with those employers,” Smith said. “We ask them what the skill gaps they’re seeing are, and we will build our curriculum to make sure those skill gaps are addressed. We’re focused largely on the jobs of the future.”

The accelerator is a free, four-week training program that provides participants, including justice-impacted people, veterans and the underemployed, with the skills and certifications they need to maintain and repair electric vehicle charging stations and other clean energy equipment.

The program offers a stipend and support for needs such as transportation and job coaching for a minimum of six months post-placement. Graduates are projected to start at about $27 per hour, offering a significant step toward financial independence.

The initiative comes as Colorado’s clean energy sector continues to grow at more than double the rate of the state’s overall employment.

Smith emphasized that the success of Goodwill’s mission-driven programs, which are free to participants, relies on a mix of funding from retail stores, grants and private donors, including the recently opened Excel Center adult high school.

He also stressed the need for Colorado businesses to embrace a fair-chance employment model and partner with Goodwill.

“Employers can partner with us with a willingness to hire our graduates,” he said. We often have businesses that come into our programs … and ultimately hire our graduates.”",https://coloradobiz.com/files/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-134050.png,N,,2025-11-18 19:59:17.741477

He explained to ABC13 how these battery storage systems can be utilized.
""Battery energy storage system is more so the sense of a seamless transition to short term.""
When it comes to the statewide grid, battery storage systems can both support the grid during an outage and times of peak demand.
Which is why plans are in place to expand battery storage capacity in Texas five times over in the next three years.","One of the latest advances in renewable energy is called a Battery Energy Storage System, known by the acronym BESS. There are residential versions like the Telsa Powerwall, industrial sized batteries large enough to power entire office buildings, and even ones that backup the Texas power grid. One of the newest BESS sites has just finished completion in Galveston County. Batteries near a substation in Dickison can now support the statewide grid.

This clean, green energy is on the rise in Texas to help keep the lights on even during an outage. ABC13 Meteorologist Elyse Smith visited the Eaton Experience Center in north Houston to learn more about this energy innovation. The site has their own BESS which the team de-energized for safety during the visit.

Rolando Barcenas is an expert in the energy field for power company Eaton. He explained to ABC13 how these battery storage systems can be utilized.

""The benefit of the BESS is not having to use it immediately and store it for later use,"" Barcenas said.

It operates like a standby generator but with an important difference.

With a standby generator, you still lose power for a moment if the main power grid were to go down. That's because the generator has to turn on and begin running. With a battery, you don't lose power at all because the energy is already there, stored in the battery. ""Battery energy storage system is more so the sense of a seamless transition to short term."" In other words, these battery storage systems are the only way to store power in case of an outage.

So, during an outage, Barcenas explains how the computer system associated with a BESS would work. The system's controller activates the battery's energy storage to keep the power flowing. And while most batteries have a lifespan of 20 to 25 years before needing to be updated or replaced, the amount of energy a battery can hold is typically only a few hours, depending on the size. That's why experts recommend having additional power sources like a generator or solar panels to keep things running if the main power grid were to go down.

When it comes to the statewide grid, battery storage systems can both support the grid during an outage and times of peak demand. In August 2023, during the record heat wave that lasted nearly the entire month, the Texas Comptroller's office reports that extra power stored in statewide battery systems connected to the grid helped reduce energy costs by nearly 50 percent.

And while batteries alone may not be how to foolproof the Texas grid, this type of energy storage is one of a kind and plays an important role in power resiliency. Reminder, most solar panels, wind turbines, and even backup generators can't store energy for later use like a battery can. Proving to be a safe and effective way to add resiliency to the statewide grid. Which is why plans are in place to expand battery storage capacity in Texas five times over in the next three years. This is to help make our grid more resilient for when we need power the most.",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/18170844_111825-ktrk-BESS-img.png?w=1600,N,,2025-11-18 21:00:31.667621

This marks the first time the DOE Loan Programs Office has concurrently finalized a conditional loan commitment and financial close, made possible by Constellation's strong balance sheet and credit worthiness. Funded by the Energy Dominance Financing Program, this interest-bearing loan will lower Constellation's cost of financing and leverage private investment to restore reliable nuclear energy to the grid and help America win the AI race.

""DOE's quick action and leadership is another huge step towards bringing hundreds of megawatts of reliable nuclear power onto the grid at this critical moment,"" said Joe Dominguez, president and CEO of Constellation. ""Under the Trump administration, the FERC and DOE have made it possible for us to vastly expedite this restart without compromising quality or safety. It's a great example of how America first energy policies create jobs, growth and opportunities and make the grid more reliable. Utilities and grid operators are moving too slowly and need to make regulatory changes that will allow our nation to unlock its abundant energy potential. Constellation and nuclear energy are helping to lead the way and we are thankful to President Trump and Secretary Wright for putting the ‘energy' back into DOE.""

""Pennsylvania is leading America's energy independence and the AI revolution by providing safe, clean, reliable nuclear power,"" said Senator Dave McCormick. ""Today's loan by President Trump and the Department of Energy is great news as it helps Constellation advance the restart of the Crane Clean Energy Center, while creating 3,400 new jobs and more than 800 megawatts of carbon-free electricity operating 24/7 to meet our increasing energy demands and economic growth across the region. I am thrilled to see Constellation's continued commitment to the Commonwealth, beyond those investments announced at the Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit this past July.""

Work to restart the reactor comes at a time of unprecedented electric demand growth from electrification and the new data centers needed to support a growing digital economy and to help America win the AI race. Crane will support grid stability by delivering reliable, around-the-clock electric supply. An economic impact study commissioned by the Pennsylvania Building & Construction Trades Council found that restarting the reactor at Crane will help keep electricity prices in check; add approximately 3,400 direct and indirect jobs; generate over $16 billion for Pennsylvania's GDP and deliver more than $3 billion in state and federal tax revenue.

The Crane Clean Energy Center is currently more than 80% staffed with over 500 employees, including engineers, mechanics, technicians and licensed operator trainees. Inspections of key plant components and regulatory reviews continue on schedule. Constellation has also committed more than $1 million in charitable giving over five years to support workforce development and local organizations in the region. In 2025 the company has donated $200,000 to more than a dozen local charities, nonprofit organizations and workforce development programs.

Launching the Crane Clean Energy Center is part of a broader multi-billion dollar investment that Constellation is making in America's largest and growing nuclear fleet to extend the lives of existing nuclear plants and boost their output, helping ensure the fleet's always-on power continues to meet the needs of America's families and businesses for decades to come.

According to First Solar officials, the company plans to spend around $330 million to establish the new complex, which is scheduled to begin operating in the second half of 2026.
First Solar has partnered with several glass manufacturers to supply glass for its panels, including NSG Group and Vitro Architectural Glass.
The Gaffney plant will be part of what is already the largest solar technology manufacturing and research and development (R&D) footprint in the Western Hemisphere.
In all, First Solar will have invested approximately $4.5 billion in American manufacturing and R&D infrastructure since 2019.","First Solar is once again expanding in the United States with a new facility planned for Gaffney, South Carolina. The plant will onshore final production processes for Series 6 modules.

According to First Solar officials, the company plans to spend around $330 million to establish the new complex, which is scheduled to begin operating in the second half of 2026. The facility is expected to create more than 600 new jobs. Officials say the expansion is in response to increased demand for domestically produced energy technology created by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed by the White House in June 2025.

“The passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the administration’s trade policies boosted demand for American energy technology, requiring a timely, agile response that allows us to meet the moment,” says CEO Mark Widmar. “We expect that this new facility will enable us to serve the U.S. market with technology that is compliant with the Act’s stringent provisions, within timelines that align with our customers’ objectives.”

As reported in an upcoming news analysis in the November issue of USGlass magazine, the growth of solar power is a promising but underutilized niche for the glass industry, with some companies adding production capabilities to produce specialized glass panels or focusing on recycling solar glass and components. First Solar has partnered with several glass manufacturers to supply glass for its panels, including NSG Group and Vitro Architectural Glass.

“The past decade has marked a substantial evolution in residential and grid-scale utility solar markets,” Paul Bush, vice president of sustainability, technical services and government affairs at Vitro, told USGlass for the November article on the state of the solar industry. “Within the residential sector, the adoption of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems by developers and homeowners has experienced significant growth, leading to a correlated increase in qualified installers. Diverse governmental tax incentives and financial subsidies primarily drive this expansion. Grid-scale utilities are experiencing rapid growth, driven by tax incentives and a push for domestically manufactured products in PV systems.”

First Solar officials explain that the new facility expands the company’s footprint in South Carolina, which currently includes a distribution center in Duncan. The Gaffney plant will be part of what is already the largest solar technology manufacturing and research and development (R&D) footprint in the Western Hemisphere. That footprint includes three fully vertically integrated manufacturing facilities in Ohio and one each in Alabama and Louisiana, along with R&D centers in Ohio and California.

The Gaffney facility is expected to increase First Solar’s capacity to produce American-made solar technology that is fully compliant with anticipated Foreign Entities of Concern guidance by 3.7 gigawatts (GW), reaching 17.7 GW of annual nameplate capacity in 2027.

As Senator Budd said in his remarks: “This is a great day to celebrate a more than a billion-dollar investment and one thousand new jobs.
“Vulcan, uniquely, and this is what got my attention in Washington, is that Vulcan is fully decoupled from China.
“But also, North Carolina is key in this.","Washington, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senator Ted Budd (R-N.C.) joined state and local leaders in delivering remarks after Vulcan Elements announced that they will be building a new $1 billion ‘Polaris facility’ in Benson, North Carolina. Senator Budd has championed the U.S. Government’s partnership with Vulcan Elements in their efforts to reshore the rare earth magnet manufacturing industry. The Polaris facility will create 1,000 new manufacturing jobs in North Carolina and bolster America’s national security by breaking our reliance on China for these vital components.

As Senator Budd said in his remarks:

“This is a great day to celebrate a more than a billion-dollar investment and one thousand new jobs. It’s a boost to the local economy, but I want you all to know how important this is for our national security.

“Vulcan, uniquely, and this is what got my attention in Washington, is that Vulcan is fully decoupled from China. We had some earlier conversations, and it was interesting that China tipped their hand to what they intended to do to constrain the American supply chain, or supplies to the United States. So, this is well timed. This is well-timed for the security of our nation. You know, after meeting the Vulcan team in Washington, I immediately realized the need to prioritize Vulcan’s efforts.

“I want to give you a few specifics, including the lead to push the Industrial Base Analysis and Sustainment, or the IBAS program funding, also working to reduce barriers to magnet production, and then talking to all of the presidential nominees who come through our Senate offices that are related to Armed Services and the Department of War supply chain. So, if they didn’t know about Vulcan, and most of them did know about Vulcan, when I asked them—if they didn’t when they came in, they sure did when they left.

“Almost every weapon in our supply chain uses magnets, including jets, submarines, and the missiles that they fire, but they’re also in things that we mentioned earlier, data centers, drones, robotics, and chips; all of which depend on rare earth magnets.

“The U.S. should have done this decades ago, but now we are, and we’re moving the critical supply chain for rare earths and so many other things away from China. Vulcan, you’re in the lead for that. So, thank you.

“But also, North Carolina is key in this. This is a great state for so many reasons, whether it’s semiconductors or batteries, and now rare earths. So, congratulations. We appreciate all that you do. We’re glad that you’re here, and we look forward to the future together.”

BACKGROUND

Senator Budd has led the charge in the U.S. Senate to support Vulcan’s efforts to reshore the rare earth magnet industry:

Led a North Carolina delegation letter to the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, Michael Duffy, highlighting the impressive work of Vulcan Elements and supporting the company’s application for funding through the Industrial Base Analysis and Sustainment (IBAS) Program.

Pushed for a provision in the FY26 NDAA directing the Secretary of Defense to provide a briefing to the Senate Armed Services Committee, no later than March 2026, on an analysis of domestic Neodymium Iron Boron (NdFeB) manufacturing in the United States or allied nations and identify barriers to domestic rare earth magnet production.

Championed a $4 million increase in IBAS funding in the Senate’s Defense Appropriations bill.

Cogeneration in the National Energy Mix

The current state of cogeneration in Mexico reflects both growing industrial interest and ongoing regulatory adjustments. According to sector data, cogeneration supplies an important share of electricity and thermal energy for large users such as chemicals, food and beverage, and manufacturing. High-efficiency cogeneration has expanded over the past decade, driven by cost-reduction needs and emissions-mitigation goals. However, changes in the regulatory environment and evolving permitting processes have introduced operational challenges for project developers. The updated electricity framework now places greater emphasis on efficiency and reliability metrics, pushing companies to modernize equipment and pursue cleaner fuels. Industry groups at the Congress noted that cogeneration remains one of the most effective technologies for reducing industrial emissions and stabilizing energy costs, particularly as natural gas supply and renewable integration become central to national planning.",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/2025-11/gas-turbine-inlet-air-hole-filter-system-large-ai-2025-03-06-04-57-25-utc%20%281%29.jpg?h=62c404c8&itok=Hy1dC2Rf,N,,2025-11-18 21:00:15.137567

Those threats to reliability stem partly from a large number of fossil fuel power plant retirements in the U.S., as well as surging demand from data centers and other large loads.
But amid shrinking power supply margins, more severe cold or wintry weather over a wide area could result in supply shortages, according to NERC.
“Record-setting demand is anticipated for some areas and may strain the grid in areas with double-digit growth rates,” the grid watchdog said in a video on its new report.
Peak demand for all areas NERC assesses has increased by 20 gigawatts, or 2.5%, since the previous winter, surpassing a 9.4 GW net gain in bulk power system resources.","Soaring power demand, including from data centers and the electrification of the economy, could contribute to energy supply shortfalls in some areas during extreme weather this winter, the North American Electric Reliability Corp. warned on Tuesday.

The report echoed other recent assessments from NERC, including longer-term outlooks, that expect sufficient energy resources during normal conditions but potential supply shortfalls and power outages under more intense weather. Those threats to reliability stem partly from a large number of fossil fuel power plant retirements in the U.S., as well as surging demand from data centers and other large loads.

“This report clearly shows that demand for electricity is skyrocketing—especially in areas serving new data centers—and reliability is still at risk,” NRECA CEO Jim Matheson said. “The addition of new resources, though significant, isn’t keeping up. Now more than ever, we need smart energy policies that keep the lights on and address this growing energy deficit.”

In NERC’s winter reliability report released Nov. 18, all areas assessed by the grid watchdog are expected to have adequate energy resources during normal winter weather conditions.

But amid shrinking power supply margins, more severe cold or wintry weather over a wide area could result in supply shortages, according to NERC.

“Record-setting demand is anticipated for some areas and may strain the grid in areas with double-digit growth rates,” the grid watchdog said in a video on its new report.

Areas at elevated risk of electricity supply shortfalls during extreme conditions this winter include the Pacific Northwest, Texas, New England and much of the Southeast. New England also faces risks to natural gas pipeline capacity in the event of extreme weather.

Peak demand for all areas NERC assesses has increased by 20 gigawatts, or 2.5%, since the previous winter, surpassing a 9.4 GW net gain in bulk power system resources. The vast majority of net capacity additions—or 8.1 GW—is from demand response resources, which can encourage customers to reduce their energy usage, rather than generation.

Some of the regions in NERC’s assessment are forecasting almost 10% demand growth. Areas with the biggest forecasted peak demand increases include the Southeast, parts of the West and the PJM Interconnection, which spans sections of the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest.

NERC noted that freezing temperatures can threaten natural gas-based generation and fuel supplies, particularly in the South. It urged natural gas utilities to prepare for severe cold and advised utilities and grid operators to require freeze protection measures and other cold weather preparedness plans.

“Electricity demand continues to grow faster than the resources being added to the grid, especially during the most extreme winter conditions where actual demand can topple forecasts,” said John Moura, NERC’s director of reliability assessments and performance analysis. “This latest assessment highlights progress on cold weather readiness but underscores that more work remains to ensure energy and fuel supplies can be reliably delivered even during the harshest conditions.”

Like every other automaker operating in North America, Stellantis announced a move to Tesla's North American Charging Standard (NACS) plug back in 2024. The company said that this would begin in 2025, so it's a few months off schedule, but likely a godsend to Dodge and Jeep EV drivers nonetheless. The move will give those owners access to more than 20,000 Tesla Supercharger stations in North America alone.

Stellantis officials said Supercharger availability will start with the Jeep Wagoneer S and Dodge Charger Daytona EV, followed by the 2026 Jeep Recon ""and other future products to be announced."" By and large, Stellantis is quite behind on its EV strategy and is using the current rollback of EV tax credits and fuel economy regulations to pivot back to gasoline-powered cars. However, like the aforementioned Recon, it still has some plans in the battery department, even if its existing models have been met with mixed reviews and slow sales.

Over the past few years, the Tesla plug has increasingly become the standard for new EVs sold in America, due to its slimmer size, ease of use and access to the vast Supercharger network. Automakers like Toyota, General Motors, Hyundai, Kia, Lucid and Rivian have already equipped their EVs with the NACS plug from the factory. Most start with NACS adapters first and then move to the native NACS plug in subsequent model years.

Stellantis isn't revealing its strategy for this, but presumably, NACS adapters will be provided to customers first before the cars themselves are outfitted with the Tesla plug.

With this approval, developers pursuing carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects in Texas will work directly with the RRC for Class VI well permitting, rather than navigating the EPA’s permit queue.

What the New Regulatory Framework Means

Under Texas’s new Class VI program:

The RRC is now the primary permitting authority for Class VI wells, overseeing applications, technical review, construction, operation, monitoring, and long-term site care. Concurrent authorization by both the EPA and the RRC will no longer be required.

The state’s Class VI rules have been developed to meet or exceed federal UIC requirements, with the EPA maintaining an oversight role.

Texas-based regulation is expected to streamline permit timing, increase regulatory certainty, and align CCS development with the state’s existing subsurface and injection-well experience.

This shift is significant for CCS developers seeking to advance projects under the federal Section 45Q tax credit framework, where a permitted Class VI well is essential for secure geological storage.

The final rule granting primacy to the RRC is effective on December 15, 2025.

The swift proliferation of data centers in the U.S., along with the electrification of buildings and transportation, is driving up electricity use across the country faster than new power supplies are added to the grid. That dwindling supply can raise the possibility of power shortfalls in extremely cold weather, when energy-intensive heating systems increase overall demand.

After multiple years of flat or near-flat growth, peak demand has grown by about 20 gigawatts, or 2.5%, from last year, NERC officials said in their annual winter assessment of the reliability of the U.S. and Canada’s power grids. New electricity net supplies added since last year were less than 10 gigawatts.

“As a result, record-setting demand is anticipated for some areas and may strain the grid in areas with double-digit growth rates,” NERC said.

Areas including PJM, the U.S. Southeast, and parts of the U.S. West have the largest increase in peak demand forecasts, NERC said.

The areas that NERC assesses, which include the U.S. and Canada, had adequate power supplies under normal expected winter weather for the three months ending in February, the regulator said. Prolonged and widespread severe frigid weather, however, raises the likelihood of supply shortages in areas including New England, the West, Texas and the Southeast, NERC said.

Growth in power sources like wind and solar, which only produce energy when the wind blows and the sun shines, has added complexity to the grid and intensified reliability concerns in some areas, said NERC. Frigid temperatures can also freeze off natural gas power production and fuel sources, increasing risks.

I am thrilled to see Constellation’s continued commitment to the Commonwealth, beyond those investments announced at the Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit this past July.""

Work to restart the reactor comes at a time of unprecedented electric demand growth from electrification and the new data centers needed to support a growing digital economy and to help America win the AI race. Crane will support grid stability by delivering reliable, around-the-clock electric supply. An economic impact study commissioned by the Pennsylvania Building & Construction Trades Council found that restarting the reactor at Crane will help keep electricity prices in check; add approximately 3,400 direct and indirect jobs; generate over $16 billion for Pennsylvania's GDP and deliver more than $3 billion in state and federal tax revenue.

The Crane Clean Energy Center is currently more than 80% staffed with over 500 employees, including engineers, mechanics, technicians and licensed operator trainees. Inspections of key plant components and regulatory reviews continue on schedule. Constellation has also committed more than $1 million in charitable giving over five years to support workforce development and local organizations in the region. In 2025 the company has donated $200,000 to more than a dozen local charities, nonprofit organizations and workforce development programs.

Launching the Crane Clean Energy Center is part of a broader multi-billion dollar investment that Constellation is making in America's largest and growing nuclear fleet to extend the lives of existing nuclear plants and boost their output, helping ensure the fleet’s always-on power continues to meet the needs of America's families and businesses for decades to come.

World leaders have gathered in Brazil for the U.N. Climate Conference. The U.S. is not there, but China is. When it comes to energy transition, the U.S. and China couldn't be on more different paths. China is moving away from fossil fuels while the U.S. is doubling down. Experts say this will have consequences for the climate and these countries' economies. NPR sent two correspondents to opposite sides of the Pacific to learn more. We begin with NPR's Julia Simon in Eureka, California.

JULIA SIMON, BYLINE: In far northern California, Chris Mikkelsen drives an old police cruiser past little wooden houses.

Pine trees with moss just, like, hanging off of them.

CHRIS MIKKELSEN: It's just an old seaside town.

SIMON: Mikkelsen is the executive director of the Humboldt Bay Harbor District, which plans to assemble wind turbines for a massive new offshore wind project. About 20 miles off this misty coast, two companies - American Vineyard Offshore and German RWE - plan to build turbines to power more than 2 million homes. Mikkelsen says the project aims to make about 270 long-term local jobs.

MIKKELSEN: It's going to, you know, change the economic viability of our community. And I get a little - my voice gets a little shaky 'cause it's going to make a better opportunity for our kids.

SIMON: Yeah.

MIKKELSEN: That's pretty important.

SIMON: The new terminal was supposed to be shovel-ready as soon as 2026, Mikkelsen says. That's no longer realistic, in part because the Trump administration recently canceled more than $426 million in federal grants for the project. Mikkelsen says it's been pencils down since then as they try to find new sources of money. This is one of dozens of actions this administration has taken to starve the renewable energy industry of federal support from canceling tax credits years early to issuing stop-work orders.

Amanda Levin at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council says the U.S. renewable industry had been growing.

AMANDA LEVIN: For the first time last year, wind and solar produced more electricity than coal. Things were headed in the right direction, but this really just takes the wind out of their sails.

SIMON: The Trump administration is reversing support for renewables, which it incorrectly labels as risky and unreliable. But across the Pacific Ocean, America's biggest competitor - China - thinks otherwise. Let's throw the mic 5,000 miles to NPR's Anthony Kuhn, who's there.

ANTHONY KUHN, BYLINE: You are right, Julia. Here in China, renewable isn't a dirty word. China's leadership has made strategic choices to include renewables in its energy mix. We're in China's Zhangbei region, which is in between the capital Beijing and the edge of the Mongolian Plateau. The area is rich in wind resources, and it's where a lot of China's wind and solar capacity is being installed.

(SOUNDBITE OF TURBINE BLADES SPINNING)

KUHN: Turbine blades swoosh past in huge circles. The electricity goes from here to a grid outside Beijing and on to the rest of China. China now dominates the global renewable sector. In the first half of this year, China built more solar than the rest of the world combined. Seventy-four percent of all large-scale wind and solar projects are being built in China. Compare that to the U.S. that's building 6%. China now has more installed generation capacity from solar and wind than from gas and coal.

It wasn't always this way. Until recently, China's economic growth came at the cost of air pollution from burning fossil fuels. But in the last few decades, authorities in Beijing began to consider a sustainable economic growth model, and renewables have been a key part of that, according to Qin Haiyan, director of the parent company of the wind farm we visited and vice president of the World Wind Energy Association.

QIN HAIYAN: (Through interpreter) Developing the economy and reducing carbon emissions to address climate change are now no longer contradictory.

KUHN: And this, according to the Asia Society's Li Shuo, is the biggest difference between the U.S. and China in climate policy today.

LI SHUO: It couldn't be a stronger contrast between the two countries.

KUHN: In China, solar and wind are now cheaper than coal and gas. Li Shuo says one of the most dramatic aspects of China's climate story is not just that they seem to be cutting their climate emissions...

LI: But also, to what extent other parts of the world can also benefit from China's low-carbon products.

SIMON: So China is now exporting turbines and solar panels and batteries around the world, from Brazil to Nigeria to Pakistan.

KUHN: That's right, Julia. All the renewables growth, both local and exports, is a bright spot amid China's slowing economy, especially its slumping real estate sector. David Fishman is a principal at the Lantau Group in Shanghai.

DAVID FISHMAN: People who used to be swinging hammers building commercial real estate are now swinging hammers installing solar panels. And that - well, yes, of course. You double - triple down on that.

(SOUNDBITE OF WIND BLOWING)

SIMON: Back in Eureka, Mikkelsen walks along a creaky dock, an abandoned pulp mill looming behind us. He says he doesn't understand why the Trump administration would cancel the grants for the terminal supporting the wind project. He says this community has been suffering since 2008 when the pulp mill closed.

MIKKELSEN: Our administration that was recently elected, not only at the presidential level but even some of our Congress and senators, really ran on a platform that we're going to build back America, that we're going to create jobs in rural America - good, skilled, trained, you know, high-paying jobs. And there's no better place. You're looking around, you're seeing the remnants of what once was.

SIMON: It is still unclear what the nationwide cuts to renewable energy mean for U.S. climate emissions.

KUHN: But in China, the climate story is more clear, and it's a rare, encouraging indicator in the global warming story. The growth of renewable energy means that China's emissions seem to be on track to peak or are nearing their peak, Li Shuo says. And China's renewable exports mean the country is helping other countries reduce their emissions too.

SIMON: Jeremy Wallace, professor at Johns Hopkins University, says now, at the end of the day...

JEREMY WALLACE: What America does is part of a story, and it is not the main part of the story. It's a cute side character.

KUHN: China, he says, is now the main character in the story of fighting climate change. Anthony Kuhn, NPR News, Zhangbei County, Hebei Province, China.

The ICDF’s new disposal cell and evaporation ponds will be constructed using multiple layers of liners made specifically for disposal of CERCLA-generated waste.
Instead, that water will be diverted to the evaporation ponds.
Craig Reese, project manager with ICP contractor Idaho Environmental Coalition, recognizes the importance of environmental responsibility as his team constructs the new disposal area.
“Every aspect of the design, construction and future operation of the engineered Cell 3 landfill and leachate collection system focuses on environmental protection,” said Reese.","IDAHO FALLS, Idaho —The Idaho Cleanup Project (ICP) is expanding a critical disposal facility, employing lessons learned from two decades of operational success and the best of American technology to continue safely disposing of waste and enabling the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Environmental Management (EM) to meet its commitments to the state of Idaho.

The Idaho CERCLA Disposal Facility (ICDF) has provided safe, cost effective and environmentally responsible disposal for contaminated waste generated by cleanup on the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) Site.

CERCLA stands for Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, a law enacted by Congress in 1980 that requires stringent waste acceptance criteria, ensuring protection of the public and the underlying Snake River Plain Aquifer.

In 2020, ICP determined it would need to expand the landfill to dispose of a projected 340,000 cubic meters of waste — comparable in size to more than 150 hot air balloons — over the next several decades, far outpacing the ICDF’s remaining available disposal capacity of 90,000 cubic meters.

The ICDF’s new disposal cell and evaporation ponds will be constructed using multiple layers of liners made specifically for disposal of CERCLA-generated waste.

In addition, an engineered collection and detection system for leachate, or liquid that seeps through the landfill, is critical to the facility.

Together, that system and the liners significantly reduce the likelihood of water percolating through the landfill into the aquifer. Instead, that water will be diverted to the evaporation ponds.

Prior to the expansion project, a coordinated effort with EM identified several lessons learned to improve operations. For instance, the expansion will offer more operational space, better management of occasional spring snowmelt water surges, easier control of water levels by linking the new evaporation ponds with the original evaporation ponds, and the capability to dispose of larger debris while maintaining landfill safety.

Craig Reese, project manager with ICP contractor Idaho Environmental Coalition, recognizes the importance of environmental responsibility as his team constructs the new disposal area.

“Every aspect of the design, construction and future operation of the engineered Cell 3 landfill and leachate collection system focuses on environmental protection,” said Reese. “This includes learning from more than 20 years of operation that will allow us to fulfill our mission.”

See EPA-HQ-OW-2025-0322.

The stated intent of the proposed rule includes:

Amending the definition of “waters of the United States” (“WOTUS”) in light of the United States Supreme Court’s 2023 decision in Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency.

Provide greater regulatory certainty/predictability/consistency by clarifying the definition of WOTUS.

Implement the overall objective of the Clean Water Act to restore and maintain the quality of the Nation’s waters while respecting State and Tribal authority over their own land and water resources.

The definition of WOTUS is arguably one of the most critical jurisdictional terms in the Clean Water Act. Its importance is magnified since it is relevant to both National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”) permitting and non-NPDES programs such as:

Section 404 of the Clean Water Act wetland permits.

Section 311 oil/hazardous substance release requirements.

Clean Water Act Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure regulations.

As a result, the definition of WOTUS has been and continues to be the subject of frequent litigation, legislative oversight, rulemakings, and public policy debates since the enactment of the modern version of the Clean Water Act in 1972.

The Trump Administration has sought to narrow aspects of the Biden-era rulemaking addressing this definition in regard to a determination of Sackett’s outline of when adjacent wetlands are jurisdictional.

The United States Supreme Court in Sackett articulated a two-part process for determining a WOTUS:

The CWA’s use of “waters” in §1362(7) refers only to “geo-graphic[al] features that are described in ordinary parlance as ‘streams, oceans, rivers, and lakes’ ” and to adjacent wetlands that are “indistinguishable” from those bodies of water due to a continuous sur-face connection. Rapanos v. United States, 547 U. S. 715, 755, 742, 739.

To assert jurisdiction over an adjacent wetland un-der the CWA, a party must establish “first, that the adjacent [body of water constitutes] . . . ‘water[s] of the United States’ (i.e., a relatively permanent body of water connected to traditional interstate navigable waters); and second, that the wetland has a continuous surface connection with that water, making it difficult to determine where the ‘water’ ends and the ‘wetland’ begins.”

EPA states by way of introduction to the proposed rule that in September 2023, the agencies issued a final rule without notice and comment amending the regulations defining WOTUS to conform to the Supreme Court’s Sackett decision. They state that numerous concerns raised by stakeholders about the Amended 2023 Rule, including that the Amended 2023 Rule does not adequately comply with the Supreme Court’s interpretation in Sackett of the scope of Federal jurisdiction under the Act as well as identifying implementation-related issues. The agencies argue that in this proposed rule they are revising the 2023 rule to:

Implement the Sackett decision.

Provide greater regulatory certainty.

Increase Clean Water Act program predictability and consistency.

This is argued to be based on the text, structure, and history of the Clean Water Act and Supreme Court precedent, taking into account other relevant factors.

EPA describes the key revisions in the proposed rule as including:

Defining key terms like “relatively permanent,” “continuous surface connection,” and “tributary” to appropriately delineate the scope of WOTUS consistent with the Clean Water Act and Supreme Court precedent;

Establishing that jurisdictional tributaries must connect to traditional navigable waters either directly or through other features that provide predictable and consistent flow;

Reaffirming that wetlands must be indistinguishable from jurisdictional waters through a continuous surface connection, which means that they must touch a jurisdictional water and hold surface water for a requisite duration year after year;

Strengthening state and tribal decision-making authority by providing clear regulatory guidelines while recognizing their expertise in local land and water resources;

Preserving and clarifying exclusions for certain ditches, prior converted cropland, and waste treatment systems; Adding a new exclusion for groundwater; and

Incorporating locally familiar terminology, such as ""wet season,"" to help determine whether a water body qualifies as WOTUS;

In addition, the limitation to wetlands that have surface water at least during the wet season and abut a jurisdictional water will further limit the scope of permafrost wetlands that are considered to have a continuous surface connection under the proposed rule. These proposed changes are intended to provide clarity and consistency to the continuous surface connection definition.

Same-day comment by industrial trade associations and the environmental organizations include predictable responses such as National Association of Manufacturers President and CEO Jay Timmons states in part:

… Manufacturers thank EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin for listening to the concerns of our industry and revising the definition of the Waters of the United States rule to bring certainty and predictability … For too long, the regulatory structure under the WOTUS rule, which often has included shifting and unclear definitions, has created legal uncertainty for manufacturers in the U.S., undermining our ability to invest and build across the country. Understanding which bodies of water require federal oversight under the Clean Water Act is critical for manufacturers planning new projects.

Water Keeper Alliance states in part that:

… By narrowing the scope of waters protected under the Clean Water Act, this reinterpretation removes federal safeguards from many rivers, streams, lakes, wetlands, and other vital waterways. Without oversight, these waters face increased risks from pollution, threatening clean drinking water, recreation, fisheries, and aquatic life … Collectively, these actions threaten to reverse more than five decades of progress to reduce highly toxic and dangerous pollutants from the environment and protect critical water resources from dangerous development projects.",https://www.mitchellwilliamslaw.com/images/site/Social_Logo.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 19:59:44.734702

A practical path forward Although Congress has taken some steps to improve the permitting process, more must be done.
Public power utilities have long set standards for reliability, affordability, and innovation.","The United States faces a complex power challenge. The rise of data centers, the return of American manufacturing and the push to electrify vehicles and homes are all driving new demands on the nation’s electrical grid. Public power utilities, which are community-owned and not-for-profit providers, are prepared to meet these needs, serving nearly 55 million Americans in more than 2,000 communities across 49 states and several territories.

However, these utilities are often slowed by an outdated, unpredictable federal permitting system. This is particularly challenging for new generation projects, as regulatory barriers and red tape can prolong timelines by years and raise costs by millions. In the end, these costs are borne by communities and leave families and businesses more vulnerable to supply disruptions or delayed improvements in reliability.

Permitting reform is not about diminishing environmental protections. Instead, it is about removing unnecessary and duplicative regulatory hurdles that slow the construction of new generation resources and other needed energy infrastructure. The American Public Power Association supports pragmatic legislative efforts that streamline the permitting and siting process, provide clearer federal guidance, and produce timelier decisions. Reform must maintain strong environmental oversight but deliver outcomes that allow vital energy projects to proceed without unnecessary delay.

When the permitting process is lengthy or unpredictable, the difficulty and expense of building new infrastructure grows. Customers are directly affected; they may see higher energy bills or even miss economic development opportunities because the process takes too long. Projects that meet environmental standards should move through federal review with clear milestones and prompt decisions. Federal policy must also ensure reviews are coordinated, not conducted in succession, so agencies work together with established schedules.

Regulatory guidance should be consistent, even as administrations change, to enable local planners to chart paths for long-term investment. Ultimately, reforms must respect local governance and accountability, so public power investments reflect the unique needs of their communities.

The customer impact of permitting delays

The impact of permitting delay is felt from America’s largest cities to its smallest. Public power utilities make up the majority of U.S. electric utilities but serve about 15% of customers, roughly 55 million people nationwide. Most of these utilities operate in smaller communities, with a typical service population of just 4,400. As a result, every increase in project cost caused by permitting delays is felt directly by those communities.

Bureaucratic delays can stretch out a single project for years, raising financing and construction costs and making it harder for utilities to invest in reliable and affordable generation or the infrastructure needed to deliver power. Uncertainty about shifting federal requirements further discourages timely investment, slowing progress on projects that will benefit public power communities.

A practical path forward

Although Congress has taken some steps to improve the permitting process, more must be done. Lawmakers should recognize when state and local environmental reviews satisfy or exceed federal requirements, reducing duplication for critical, low-impact projects. Reasonable, enforceable deadlines for federal agency decisions will remove much of the unpredictability from the current process. When projects pose minimal environmental impact, an expedited review option should be available. These improvements should clarify compliance expectations without weakening environmental stewardship.

APPA supports four guiding principles for reform: predictability, so utilities know what to expect and when; efficiency, through better agency cooperation and fewer duplicative steps; transparency, by tracking project milestones openly; and meaningful stakeholder input at each stage. Sustained funding for federal agencies is also critical, as under-resourced offices are often a root cause of slow permitting.

Public power utilities have long set standards for reliability, affordability, and innovation. Their ability to build energy infrastructure where and when it is needed is essential for powering schools, hospitals, businesses, and homes nationwide. Smart, infrastructure-neutral reforms grounded in predictability and efficiency will support further investment in safe, reliable, affordable power.

President Biden once promised to lift up American workers by creating good jobs in clean energy. The U.S. committed a lot of money to that. President Trump's distaste for renewables scrambled that plan, but the effort is still alive in Illinois. NPR's Andrea Hsu reports from Chicago.

ANDREA HSU, BYLINE: Asante McKinney's first job out of school was as a dental assistant. For a while, she thought, this might be my calling.

ASANTE MCKINNEY: I enjoyed it. Like I always tell people, good health starts at the mouth.

HSU: But in the back of her mind lingered a long-held dream - getting into the skilled trades.

MCKINNEY: You know, they say that's hard labor, but I like to use my hands. I like thinking. I just didn't know how to go about doing it until I found HIRE360.

HSU: HIRE360. That's a nonprofit that recruits people from underserved communities for good-paying jobs in construction. I meet McKinney inside their training center, a converted warehouse. Through a nine-week program, she refreshed her math skills, earned safety certifications and landed a spot as a trainee with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. Already, she's on job sites installing high-voltage wiring.

MCKINNEY: I'm very hands-on - more than what I thought I would be allowed to be, which is really good for me.

HSU: Now McKinney is hoping, striving for a career as a union electrician, and she has the state's backing. In 2021, Illinois passed the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act, a landmark bill talked about as a model for the country. It set a goal for Illinois to get to 100% clean energy by 2050 with a workforce that includes those deemed equity-eligible. That includes people like McKinney, who live in communities that have long faced discrimination and heavy pollution. Pat Devaney of the Illinois AFL-CIO took part in negotiations.

PAT DEVANEY: So equity and making sure our workforce was diverse around clean energy was very much a top priority of labor.

HSU: If that sounds familiar, it's because the Biden administration would later advance those same goals. The administration allocated billions of dollars in federal grants and clean energy tax credits to encourage contractors to use union labor and seek a diverse talent pool. The hope was those incentives would create millions of middle-class jobs, but President Trump isn't a fan.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's a green new scam, greatest scam in history - the greatest in history.

HSU: So now tax credits for wind and solar projects are getting phased out within a few years - far sooner than planned - and the vision for pulling historically disadvantaged workers into clean energy jobs has gotten murky. In a statement to NPR, White House spokesman Kush Desai wrote, instead of DEI boondoggles that accomplish nothing, the Trump administration is laying the groundwork for Americans of all backgrounds to help build our next golden age. Still, in Illinois, Pat Devaney says the work is getting results.

DEVANEY: I don't see Illinois changing course one bit in how we're approaching renewable investments, climate change, and certainly how we approach DEI and promoting diversity in our workforce.

HSU: He says Illinois is still pouring hundreds of millions of dollars of its own into the transition to clean energy. The problem is, contractors were anticipating those generous federal tax credits on top of state investments. Devaney fears the early sunsetting of those tax credits will lead contractors to cancel planned projects, costing Illinois tens of thousands of jobs. What's more, they may not plan new projects.

DEVANEY: I still don't think people can wrap their mind around the massive amounts of investments that they were going to make and the positive impact that was going to have on our country in terms of job creation.

HSU: Now, not everything has come to a screeching halt. In fact, right now there's a rush to get renewable projects going while the tax credits are still available. Asante McKinney is excited about her new career and what it will mean for her family. She and her wife live on the south side of Chicago with their 2-year-old son.

MCKINNEY: You know, he's an amazing kid, but I always ask myself, can I see my son walking to school from over here? No.

HSU: She's already imagining the day when she can buy a house elsewhere.

MCKINNEY: That was a big part of why I wanted to get into the trades - is for better living.

HSU: And also to be able to point to projects and tell her son, I had something to do with that.

It’s a great example of how America first energy policies create jobs, growth and opportunities and make the grid more reliable. Utilities and grid operators are moving too slowly and need to make regulatory changes that will allow our nation to unlock its abundant energy potential. Constellation and nuclear energy are helping to lead the way and we are thankful to President Trump and Secretary Wright for putting the ‘energy’ back into DOE.”

“Pennsylvania is leading America's energy independence and the AI revolution by providing safe, clean, reliable nuclear power,” said Senator Dave McCormick. “Today’s loan by President Trump and the Department of Energy is great news as it helps Constellation advance the restart of the Crane Clean Energy Center, while creating 3,400 new jobs and more than 800 megawatts of carbon-free electricity operating 24/7 to meet our increasing energy demands and economic growth across the region. I am thrilled to see Constellation’s continued commitment to the Commonwealth, beyond those investments announced at the Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit this past July.”

Work to restart the reactor comes at a time of unprecedented electric demand growth from electrification and the new data centers needed to support a growing digital economy and to help America win the AI race. Crane will support grid stability by delivering reliable, around-the-clock electric supply. An economic impact study commissioned by the Pennsylvania Building & Construction Trades Council found that restarting the reactor at Crane will help keep electricity prices in check; add approximately 3,400 direct and indirect jobs; generate over $16 billion for Pennsylvania’s GDP and deliver more than $3 billion in state and federal tax revenue.

The Crane Clean Energy Center is currently more than 80% staffed with over 500 employees, including engineers, mechanics, technicians and licensed operator trainees. Inspections of key plant components and regulatory reviews continue on schedule. Constellation has also committed more than $1 million in charitable giving over five years to support workforce development and local organizations in the region. In 2025 the company has donated $200,000 to more than a dozen local charities, nonprofit organizations and workforce development programs.

Launching the Crane Clean Energy Center is part of a broader multi-billion dollar investment that Constellation is making in America’s largest and growing nuclear fleet to extend the lives of existing nuclear plants and boost their output, helping ensure the fleet’s always-on power continues to meet the needs of America’s families and businesses for decades to come.

In focus

In the first week of Cop30, I spoke with Konrad Beston, a stormwater supervisor in south-western Canada, who is attending the talks for the first time. His field is being reshaped by global warming. “My job involves replacing infrastructure that is undersized and cannot handle the current conditions of climate change,” he told me. “And it involves protecting the wildlife affected by the changes, protecting the salmon – which is something that’s so important to me.”

Heavy rainstorms are becoming more severe and frequent in south-western Canada, he said. Then there are atmospheric river events, or long, narrow bands of vapour that pick up water from the ocean and dump it as rain. “It’s pretty much a river falling from the sky,” said Beston, who is a member of the Canadian Union of Public Employees and works in British Columbia.

All that rain has destroyed infrastructure while increasing runoff, threatening people and nature. Beston’s responsibility is to fix that, but his department is understaffed. “We’re overwhelmed, so we need more workers to come in – and workers need to have a say in how new infrastructure is getting built,” he told me.

Beston made the long journey to Brazil to advocate for workers to have a voice in climate policy. “We need workers to be a part of the plans to fix the infrastructure, to make it stronger,” he said. “We know what we’re dealing with, and without our expertise mistakes get made.”

He is backing a proposal that would make worker input a reality in UN talks. Known as the Belém Action Mechanism, or Bam, it’s the top demand by civil society groups at this year’s talks. The plan is focused on a “just transition” towards a green, resilient economy that does not leave workers or communities behind.

The just transition has been discussed in UN climate talks before and is mentioned in the preamble to the 2015 Paris agreement. But Bam proponents say countries don’t have to track or measure effects of such policies on workers or share best practices on how to protect them. Their new proposal would require countries to accelerate, coordinate and support a true global just transition.

Last week, the proposal saw a major advance when the G77 plus China – countries that together represent 80% of the world’s population – issued a call for a just transition mechanism to be created. “It was a major moment, a huge breakthrough,” Teresa Anderson, an ActionAid spokesperson, told me at Cop.

Putting meat on the bones of just transition-focused pledges could help build support for climate action, advocates say. “There’s a lot of focus on job creation, but not on the quality of those jobs, and that’s a key problem,” said Giulia Laganà, director of the International Trade Union Commission’s just transition and climate department. Workers won’t want new green jobs if they are less stable, worse paid, or offer subpar benefits to ones from the incumbent economy, she explained in Belém.

“That’s the reason why a greenlash is happening across a lot of the world,” she said. “There’s been talk at climate summits, but it isn’t happening on the ground. That’s leaving workers disillusioned, and that is something that is monetized and exploited by certain political actors to backtrack on climate commitments.”

Support for a just transition is in alignment with ancient principles, said Beston, who is Métis, one of Canada’s three legally recognised Indigenous peoples. “One thing I hold close to my heart is the seven generations teaching,” he said, referring to the belief that those making decisions today should consider their impact on the next seven generations of communities.

Many advocates for more green jobs around the world echo this notion, with Anderson noting the problems with short-term thinking, saying: “There’s an idea that considerations for workers and communities are a ‘nice to have’ thing in climate action, but that short-sightedness doesn’t get us anywhere.

“The transition needs to include those considerations to be effective.”

Red and Blue States: Complementary Risk Ecosystems Red and blue states play different but complementary roles: Red states provide industrial infrastructure, labor, and permitting conditions favorable to large-scale deployment.","When Federal Catalysts Stall

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) represent the most significant public investment in U.S. clean energy history. Thousands of projects, spanning carbon capture, hydrogen hubs, and advanced manufacturing, are now underway across federal agencies.

Within this landscape, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has awarded more than 500 projects that aim to commercialize first-of-a-kind (FOAK) technologies, demonstrating deep industrial decarbonization. But as political uncertainty grows and some projects face delays or cancellations, one question looms: who buys down the risk when federal funding recedes?

Our De-Risking Rubric offers a structured way to assess where risk resides—technical, financial, and social—and how the private sector can share responsibility for sustaining progress.

Geography of Risk

Public investment is reshaping the industrial map in surprising ways. Roughly 85 percent of IRA-related clean-tech dollars—and 60 percent of DOE demonstration projects—are located in states that voted Republican in the last presidential election.

These include Texas, Louisiana, and Alabama—regions historically tied to fossil energy but rich in infrastructure, workforce, and land for large-scale deployment. Meanwhile, blue states such as California, New York, and Massachusetts continue to lead in research, procurement standards, and market-shaping policies like Buy Clean.

Together, red and blue states are creating a geographically diverse ecosystem of risk reduction and opportunity.

The De-Risking Rubric: Technical, Financial, and Social Dimensions

The De-Risking Rubric evaluates projects along three interlocking axes:

Technical risk declines when projects collect and share real-world performance data—cost, uptime, and energy use—creating a factual base for replication.

Financial risk falls when projects meet schedules and budgets, giving lenders and off-takers confidence to finance “next-of-a-kind” deployments.

Social risk diminishes when communities and workers are engaged early, permitting is predictable, and benefits are transparent and measurable.

Across all dimensions, the goal is the same: build the evidence needed to reduce uncertainty and lower the cost of capital. Shared data transforms isolated demonstrations into an investable market class, accelerating replication and attracting private investment.

Public to Private Data Bridge

As IRA and BIL funds flow, the next challenge is ensuring projects remain financeable and insurable after federal dollars expire. Investors now prize one thing above all: transparency. They need consistent, verified data comparing projected and actual costs, schedules, and operations. Put simply, the FOAK gap is a data gap. Even projects that lose federal support can still de-risk their sector by disclosing performance metrics that refine investor and insurer models.

Red and Blue States: Complementary Risk Ecosystems

Red and blue states play different but complementary roles:

Red states provide industrial infrastructure, labor, and permitting conditions favorable to large-scale deployment.

Blue states generate early markets, innovation ecosystems, and policy frameworks that sustain demand for low-carbon products.

Federal dollars catalyze innovation, but state and local governance anchor deployment—each reducing risk in complementary ways.

Toward Durable, Insurable Markets

The energy transition ultimately depends on projects that can stand on their own—technically, socially, and financially. Programs that generate verifiable, high-quality data will continue to attract insurers and financiers as public funds wane.

De-risking, in this sense, is the bridge from federally backed pilots to market-driven deployment. When projects demonstrate not only innovation but reliability, they earn capital-market confidence—and that confidence sustains long-term decarbonization.

Conclusion

America’s energy transition is not a story of partisanship but of risk management. Federal investments have catalyzed thousands of projects, but the lasting challenge is building systems that endure beyond political cycles.

Understanding and mitigating technical, financial, and social risk is essential to a durable energy economy. Mastering that de-risking bridge will determine whether the United States leads the next industrial revolution or watches it happen elsewhere.",https://kleinmanenergy.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/iStock-2212401536-aspect-ratio-1280-225-1200x630-c-default.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 18:00:36.786197

The report, prepared by the Colorado Energy Office with support from the Colorado Department of Transportation and in coordination with the Colorado Workforce Development Council, identifies the careers most essential to the state’s clean energy transition. Funded by a federal Climate Pollution Reduction Grant and state dollars, the analysis evaluates workforce gaps, training pathways, and strategies to build an equitable climate workforce.

Governor Jared Polis said clean energy continues to drive economic growth and job creation in Colorado. “These innovative technologies are protecting air quality and the environment while creating new opportunities for our state’s workforce,” he said. “We are proud to support the strong workforce needed to drive innovation and achieve our climate goals.”

The report highlights the need for skilled workers, including electricians, plumbers, HVAC technicians, construction laborers and technicians who service renewable energy and electric vehicle systems. Colorado Energy Office Executive Director Will Toor said the state’s clean energy transition depends on workers who build efficient homes, install solar and geothermal systems and maintain zero-emission vehicles and charging stations.

The analysis identifies 20 “climate critical occupations” with the largest gaps between projected job growth and workforce demand. Occupations facing the most significant shortages include electricians, construction laborers and managers, wind turbine service technicians, solar installers, power-line workers, electric vehicle technicians and HVAC technicians trained in heat pump technology.

Training challenges vary across occupations and include limited opportunities in rural areas, shortages of qualified instructors, and gaps in specific technical skills. Barriers for new workers include financial constraints, lack of transportation or childcare and limited access to training in their preferred language.

To address these issues, the report recommends expanding early exposure to climate careers in K-12 schools, increasing training options across the state, strengthening Registered Apprenticeship programs, improving coordination among state agencies and training organizations and prioritizing access for rural and resort communities.

“Achieving Colorado’s ambitious climate goals depends on our ability to rapidly train a skilled and diverse pipeline of talent across the state,” said CWDC Managing Director Lee Wheeler-Berliner. “We must move to action collaboratively.”

The report aligns with broader state efforts to build a climate-ready workforce, including a Registered Apprenticeship through the Weatherization Assistance Program, new training dollars through the Training for Residential Energy Contractors grant, and a Zero Emissions Vehicle Workforce Development group.",https://coloradobiz.com/files/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-133241.png,N,,2025-11-18 17:03:07.973727

Located at 1217 Woodward Avenue, the 1,400-square-foot store will carry a full assortment of footwear, apparel, and accessories for men and women, as well as kids’ footwear.

According to the VF Corp.-owned brand, the store’s footwear assortment will focus on signature silhouettes such as the 6-Inch Premium Waterproof Boots, Field Boots, Euro Hikers, and 3-Eye Handsewn Boat Shoes for men; and 6-Inch Premium Waterproof Boots, Noreen Boat Shoes, and the new Stone Street collection for women. Apparel will focus primarily on outerwear, the company noted.

Gautham Rao, vice president and general manager of Americas, told FN in an interview that the brand’s newest store was “designed to reflect Timberland’s 50+ year heritage of crafted, weather-ready style, in an open floorplan that invites exploration.”

The executive noted that design details throughout the space include oak wood, brushed steel fixtures, textured concrete walls and leather accents.

As for why Timberland chose to open its own brick-and-mortar location in Detroit, Rao attributes the city’s “resilience and creativity” as some of the reasons.

“[Detroit] is a place that has reinvented itself time and again, and that spirit really resonates with Timberland,” Rao maintained. “Our brand is rooted in hard work, community, and self-expression – values that Detroit embodies. Opening our first freestanding store on Woodward Avenue is about honoring that connection and being part of the city’s ongoing story.”

The executive also noted that the city has an “amazing duality” of both grit and style. “It’s a city built on industry, but it’s also a hub for music, art, and fashion,” Rao said. “While Timberland has grown to become a global streetwear icon, we’ve never forgotten that we started on job sites. That blend of culture and utility is exactly what Detroit represents. People here know how to work hard and look good doing it, and that’s the essence of Timberland.”

As for how the local community is responding to the new store so far, Rao said the company is already “seeing great energy” from the public. He added that Timberland hosted a pop-up activation at Riverfront Fall Fest last month that was well received

“There seems to be genuine excitement around Timberland coming to Detroit – not only for the core Timberland brand, but also for our Timberland Pro line for skilled trade workers,” Rao added. “We can’t wait to open and have the chance to engage with the good people of Detroit every day!”

This news comes after VF Corporation president and chief executive officer Bracken Darrell told analysts in October that Timberland, along with The North Face, “delivered broad-based growth” in the second quarter.

In Q2, Timberland saw sales increase 7 percent to $506.4 million. VF noted that Timberland saw strong demand in the Americas driven by a strong back-to-school season. The shoe brand also saw strong demand for the 6-Inch Premium boot, led by the Americans and EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa), as the boat shoe also grew in all regions.

“The opportunity in Timberland is really significant because we can continue to grow the boot, we can grow in other footwear franchises and we can unlock apparel around the world, all at the same time,” Darrell told analysts last month. “And in the U.S., especially, this will be supported by expanded and enhanced distribution. We have the game plan to do that now.”",https://wwd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC04709.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1,N,,2025-11-18 17:01:57.902133

This petition parallels a lawsuit also initiated today by the Sierra Club and clean energy trade organizations, which challenges a similar fast track in MISO’s neighboring grid operator, Southwest Power Pool.
It lacks meaningful guardrails that ensure new energy projects come online on a timeframe that keeps up with MISO’s claimed needs,” said Caroline Reiser, Senior Attorney for Climate & Energy at NRDC.
ERAS does the opposite.” “Clean energy is facing unprecedented challenges, including cancellation of federal tax incentives and the ban on federal environmental permits.
This is just another example of the unfair advantage given to polluting, last-century technology,” said Katie Nekola, General Counsel for Clean Wisconsin.","—

Earthjustice filed the lawsuit today on behalf of environmental groups Clean Wisconsin and Natural Resources Defense Council, and together with Sierra Club, challenged FERC’s approval to fast-track the interconnection of mostly fossil-fueled generation in states where Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) operates.

The lawsuit challenges FERC’s approval of the Expedited Resource Addition Study (ERAS) process, which allows the fast-tracked projects to pass on significant upgrade costs to residential customers and to skip over clean energy projects that have been waiting for years to connect to the grid. MISO, which submitted the proposal to FERC, claims that the fast track is necessary to meet increased demand from data centers powering artificial intelligence.

So far, requests for the FERC-approved fast track are three-quarters gas capacity. That would add at least 18 gigawatts of gas-burning generation in MISO’s footprint, which stretches from Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan south to Louisiana and Mississippi. Some of the largest projects include a 1.2 gigawatt gas plant in Paris, Wisconsin—where Clean Wisconsin has already challenged another new gas plant—and three new 1.5 gigawatt gas units to serve Meta data centers in Louisiana, where the state Public Service Commission ignored Earthjustice’s partners’ concerns in fast-tracking state processes as well. Gas-fired generation is more expensive for consumers than the affordable clean energy that dominates MISO’s normal interconnection queue. This year, solar had the lowest levelized cost of energy value at $38-79 per megawatt hour.

Clean Wisconsin, NRDC, and Sierra Club challenge FERC’s decision granting MISO approval to shift the costs of fast-tracked projects to residential customers, and the undue advantages the fast-tracked process will grant to mostly gas-burning power plants over thousands of megawatts of clean energy that could also serve to meet needs. As petitioners raised in the FERC proceeding, the agency improperly dismissed the potential for the fast track to exacerbate challenges in processing and connecting the rest of the queued resources in MISO.

This petition parallels a lawsuit also initiated today by the Sierra Club and clean energy trade organizations, which challenges a similar fast track in MISO’s neighboring grid operator, Southwest Power Pool.

“FERC is letting grid operators like MISO rewrite the rule book to the benefit of fossil fuel and data center companies, and at the expense of everyone else,” said Ada Statler, Senior Associate Attorney at Earthjustice. “FERC is sidelining cheaper clean energy projects, and allowing utilities to pass on the higher costs of methane gas to other customers, despite its legal mandate to ensure just and reasonable rates.”

“ERAS creates a system where a handful of projects, primarily gas plants, get to shortcut the line and receive major financial advantages. It lacks meaningful guardrails that ensure new energy projects come online on a timeframe that keeps up with MISO’s claimed needs,” said Caroline Reiser, Senior Attorney for Climate & Energy at NRDC. “We need an interconnection process that is fair, transparent, and focused on getting the most reliable and affordable resources on the grid quickly. ERAS does the opposite.”

“Clean energy is facing unprecedented challenges, including cancellation of federal tax incentives and the ban on federal environmental permits. This is just another example of the unfair advantage given to polluting, last-century technology,” said Katie Nekola, General Counsel for Clean Wisconsin.",https://earthjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/earthjustice-logo-1200-1.png,N,,2025-11-18 17:03:22.801995

Developing a Policy Roadmap for the Southeast Battery Industry Over the past year, C2ES has hosted four roundtables related to the battery and critical material industry across the Southeast.","Georgia occupies a crucial position in the Southeast battery supply chain. As the region’s leader in electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing investment, the state is a key market for batteries produced locally. Since 2018, Georgia has announced over $27.3 billion in investments to manufacture electric mobility products, including Kia’s West Point manufacturing facility, Hyundai’s Bryan County Metaplant, and Rivian’s upcoming Atlanta East Coast headquarters and Social Circle, GA manufacturing facility. This rapid growth in manufacturing has attracted suppliers to the state and sent a clear demand signal for the region that the industry is here.

Georgia’s success in attracting EV companies to build large scale final assembly plants is creating opportunity for other states in the region to benefit from the development of an end-to-end battery supply chain. States across the region are leaning into their individual strengths to take advantage of new opportunities afforded from different parts of the value chain, including mineral sourcing, mid-stream manufacturing, and battery recycling. This growth across Georgia and the broader region’s economy is fundamental to supporting the long-term success of the robust EV ecosystem in the state. Each state in the region has a role to play in establishing a cluster of new technology development and industry growth and stands to gain significant job creation and economic benefits.

Convening Industry Stakeholders to Support Regional Development

On November 5, C2ES cohosted a roundtable with the Georgia Tech Strategic Energy Institute to highlight the current industry landscape in Georgia and explore actions to secure the domestic battery and critical materials supply chain in the region. The event brought together over 45 stakeholders from the Georgia and across the Southeast to discuss supportive strategies and next steps for an industry at an inflection point in its development.

Several key themes emerged throughout the event:

Workforce development is a linchpin for the long-term growth potential of the industry.

There was broad agreement that Georgia must build on its existing workforce development programs to broaden access to training for emerging sectors. The battery industry provides new career pathways in advanced manufacturing and innovation in a sector that may be unfamiliar to jobseekers. Participants suggested that the industry should engage with technical colleges to identify more direct opportunities to support training, and the need for educational campaigns to increase young students’ awareness of opportunities in the battery sector.

Commercialization pathways must be clearer for the new technological innovations emerging from Southeast research institutions.

Currently, gaps exist in the translation of new technologies from concepts developed in a lab to real-world companies with commercial offerings. This is due in part to a lack of early-stage investors for the battery industry in the Southeast. Further challenges exist in the funding landscape for nascent companies, who are challenged to secure capital to prove the scalability of their technologies. Roundtable participants called for more integrated partnerships between industry and research institutions, and more education of investors on the Southeast battery landscape to facilitate the commercialization of newly developed technologies.

New battery and material manufacturing facilities in the Southeast need near-term policy support to be more competitive on global price today.

To develop an American battery industry that is competitive in the long term with other global producers, Southeast states must invest today in building out an industrial base for battery material manufacturing. This includes near-term policy support and industry actions to enable producers to compete on price in the global market currently dominated by mature actors that benefit from low input costs and economies of scale. Participants identified several ways to lower costs for manufacturers, including providing access to low-cost renewable energy, offering preferential funding terms for new manufacturing lines, and supporting increased high-volume scale automated manufacturing processes.

Developing a Policy Roadmap for the Southeast Battery Industry

Over the past year, C2ES has hosted four roundtables related to the battery and critical material industry across the Southeast. Throughout the series, participants collaboratively developed a set of near-term, actionable recommendations to drive the industry forward. This includes conversations hosted in the following states, each of which includes takeaways and recommendations from the conversation:

Knoxville, Tennessee

Tuscaloosa, Alabama

Charlotte, North Carolina

In the coming days, C2ES will compile and publish the takeaways from the roundtable Atlanta, Georgia. Next year, participants from each event and other stakeholders will reconvene for a regional summit to turn ideas into action and build a path forward for a secure, resilient Southeast U.S. battery materials supply chain.",https://www.c2es.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/iStock-1383415209.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 18:00:42.044040

Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” Act, which passed in July, cut several tax credits aimed at encouraging long-term investment in energy efficiency and clean energy.
These tax credits were implemented as part of former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and were originally set to be phased out in 2032.
On Dec. 31, the full 30% credit offered through the Business Energy Investment Tax Credit expires, leaving only the 6% base credit through 2028, before it is phased out entirely.
“It’ll be easy to maintain, and it’ll be cheaper to run, but if you can’t afford it, the tax credits aren’t (going to be) there that helps some of our clients afford it.","Since President Donald Trump took office again in January, costs for imported steel, lumber and more have fluctuated wildly as tariffs have been implemented, raised or reduced over the past year.

This uncertainty has made project planning more challenging for professionals in architecture and construction.

Construction cost estimation is a “losing battle” these days, Rachel Smith-Streck, director of strategy and partner at TAP Architecture in Oklahoma City said.

“Just in general, tariffs are affecting everything, so you can’t pinpoint your target,” Smith-Streck said. “Usually, we can do some cost estimation, but now it’s a losing battle. What we think the numbers are going to be when we get to working with the construction team, who has a real job to do, (the cost) is over here,” she said, gesturing up, “and we thought it was right here,” gesturing down.

The impending expiration or reduction of several commercial and residential tax credits for HVAC and renewable energy sources at the end of the year are also raising final construction costs, Smith-Streck said.

These tax credits were implemented as part of former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and were originally set to be phased out in 2032.

On Dec. 31, the full 30% credit offered through the Business Energy Investment Tax Credit expires, leaving only the 6% base credit through 2028, before it is phased out entirely. The ITC applies to the cost of commercial installations of qualifying energy systems, including solar, storage, geothermal, fuel cells and wind.

“I know the expiration is coming up, and that’s going to be a challenge, mainly because (geothermal) is something we always push if our client can do it,” Smith-Streck said. “If you can afford that upfront cost, it’s way better, but obviously, now that you don’t have those credits either, that’s going to be a challenge.”

Smith-Streck said TAP Architecture is working with Mid-America Christian University on a project now, and they’re considering a geothermal energy system.

“When we’re thinking about their project, if they can buy that in the beginning of a new build, it’s going to save them money in the long run, because they’re going to keep that building forever,” Smith-Streck said. “It’ll be easy to maintain, and it’ll be cheaper to run, but if you can’t afford it, the tax credits aren’t (going to be) there that helps some of our clients afford it.

The company wants to add 30 million metric tons per annum (mtpa) of additional LNG capacity to the previously approved 28 mtpa. Plaquemines is already the second-largest LNG facility in the U.S. and last month was responsible for 22% of total exports from the country, according to data from financial firm LSEG.

“Our decision to significantly increase the project’s permitted capacity reflects the strong market demand we continue to see and this expansion will play a vital role in meeting that demand,” Venture Global CEO Mike Sabel said in a statement.

The proposed expansion would allow the company to produce over 100 million mtpa of the liquid fuel and challenge QatarEnergy and Cheniere as the world’s top exporter of LNG.

A mere startup three years ago, Venture Global quickly became the second-largest U.S. LNG exporter with a business model that lets it export cargoes while construction and commissioning phases are still underway.

The strategy has allowed the company to profit from higher spot market prices before it begins supplying longer-term customers, but the practice has also resulted in arbitration cases and lawsuits from customers that include several of the world’s largest energy companies.

The Plaquemines expansion will be built incrementally in three phases and consist of 32 modular liquefaction trains, the company said.

Venture Global has also filed an application with the U.S. Department of Energy for the export authorizations associated with the additional planned capacity, the company said.

Campbell Plant.","WEST OLIVE, Mich. — A coal-fired power plant in West Olive, Mich., could finish its long-awaited sunsetting following the expiration of an emergency order by the United States Department of Energy (DOE) at 12:00 a.m. Wednesday.

Consumers Energy's J.H. Campbell Plant was slated to close its doors for good in May, but on the eve of its retirement, the DOE declared an emergency and ordered the plant to remain open temporarily. That order was set to expire in August, but the DOE handed down a second order to keep the plant open through Nov. 19 at 12:00 a.m.

In an Oct. 30 Consumers Energy quarterly earnings call, the utility company said keeping the plant open cost the company about $80 million between May 23 and Sept. 30, which equates to about $610,000 per day.

The utility company said it was passing the cost on to customers of the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), an electrical grid operator that provides service to 15 states and the Canadian province of Manitoba. The cost will be spread across utility companies in the MISO grid, which include about 45 million people in the United States and Canada.

The DOE said its emergency declaration was ""due to a shortage of electric energy, a shortage of facilities for the generation of electricity, and other causes"" in the Midwest region of the country.

The DOE laid out four justifications of its emergency declarations in the order, saying first that the initial emergency declaration was in response to the North American Electric Reliability Corporation's (NERC) 2025 Summer Reliability Assessment in May.

“[D]emand forecasts and resource data indicate that MISO is at elevated risk of operating reserve shortfalls during periods of high demand or low resource output,” the DOE order cited from the reliability assessment.

The DOE also points to multiple electrical generation facilities in Michigan having retired in recent years, claiming that about 2,700 megawatts of coal-fired generating capacity have been lost since 2020. The DOE warns of further loss of electrical generation on the MISO grid if the J.H. Campbell Plant retired on schedule, despite Consumers Energy acquiring a natural gas plant in Covert, Michigan.

Finally, the DOE said that the MISO's Planning Resource Auction Results for the 2025-2026 Planning Year noted that for parts of the grid, including Michigan, “new capacity additions were insufficient to offset the negative impacts of decreased accreditation, suspensions/retirements and external resources.”

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel called the initial order in May a ""fabricated energy emergency"" and filed suit, claiming the postponement of the closure was arbitrary and illegal. She later also filed suit against the second order, but neither of the lawsuits resulted in an injunction against the DOE's order.

In 2019, contaminated water was found in drinking water near the J.H. Campbell Plant, the Sierra Club announced. The results found elevated levels of arsenic, lead and radium in homes that draw their water from private wells.

In August of this year, locals and leaders, headed by the Michigan League of Conservation Voters and the state chapter of the Sierra Club, gathered nearby to say it's time to let the plant go.

The first power-generating unit of the J.H. Campbell Plant was commissioned in 1962, with two more units being commissioned in 1967 and 1980.

The intent was to significantly lower the imputed fuel efficiency for electric vehicles when manufacturers used them to comply with fuel economy standards. But auto manufacturers pushed back hard on the proposed revised PEF, arguing in comments to the proposed rule that the transition to a new PEF was too abrupt. Instead, they argued that the fuel content factor be continued or phased out more slowly.

DOE responded to the auto industry concerns about an abrupt shift in the PEF by issuing a final rule that phased out the fuel content factor over three years rather than eliminating it immediately. In other words, DOE listened to the auto industry’s concerns and responded to them by making the PEF somewhat less strong in its first three years.

The Eighth Circuit threw out the new PEF on the grounds that the statutory language directing DOE to establish a PEF doesn’t authorize a fuel content factor. The language is very broad and included as a factor “the need of the United States to conserve all forms of energy and the relative scarcity and value to the United States of all fuel used to generate electricity.” DOE argued in the Iowa case that the language gave the agency ample room to transition the PEF’s stringency by phasing out the fuel content factor rather than eliminating it immediately.

Relying on both Loper Bright v Raimondo and the major questions doctrine, the Eighth Circuit rejected DOE’s argument. It gave no deference to the agency’s application of the governing statute to a very complicated set of facts and said that the statute could not be used to promote electric vehicles without express Congressional delegation under the major questions doctrine.

Now that the new PEF has been thrown out, under the court’s ruling the old PEF goes back into effect for compliance with the CAFE standards. The entire question of CAFE compliance is up in the air right now: Congress has zeroed out penalties for failure to comply; NHTSA is also claiming that the Biden standards are illegal and that the agency will “exercise its enforcement authority regarding all existing CAFE and medium- and heavy-duty standards in accordance with the interpretation set forth in this rulemaking.” But if auto companies do attempt to comply, the court has directed that the old 2000 PEF should be used. Of course the old PEF favors electric vehicles much more heavily than the Biden PEF and uses a fuel economy factor indefinitely rather than phasing it out. So the result of the court’s decision is to exacerbate the problem it claims the new Biden PEF created: EVs will be weighted more heavily than they should, allowing automakers to use fewer of them for compliance purposes and allowing internal combustion engine vehicles to be less fuel efficient.",https://legal-planet.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/republican-climate-deniers1.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 21:00:45.646992

This report shows local governments can support residents with the costs of relocating by using familiar tools in new ways or deploying new tools to fund buyouts.
Since 1993, FEMA has provided more than $6.8 billion to support more than 45,000 buyouts, with most funds distributed after federal disaster declarations.

“Buyouts are an increasingly important way to help people relocate to safer locations,” said Rob Moore, a director within NRDC’s Climate Adaptation Division. “They not only allow high-risk property owners to move somewhere safer, but the newly acquired properties can become part of the community’s longer-term climate resilience plans.”

The current administration has canceled billions of dollars in previously approved Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) resilience grants and halted or scaled back key mitigation programs, leaving communities with more risk and fewer federal options. This report, Funding and Financing Voluntary Buyouts and Relocation: Going Beyond Federal Grants, lays out six specific ways states or localities could step up as the federal government steps out.

""In the current federal environment, having more flexible and local funding streams is more important than ever,"" said Grace Rogers, Manager for Climate Resilient Coasts and Watersheds at EDF. ""Proactively funding and financing buyouts, rather than waiting to act until disaster recovery funds are made available, enables state and local governments to be more responsive to communities' adaptation needs.""

Climate change is causing people to rethink where they live, but most do not have the resources to relocate without some level of assistance. Voluntary home buyouts are an essential part of helping people find their way to a safer location. This report shows local governments can support residents with the costs of relocating by using familiar tools in new ways or deploying new tools to fund buyouts.

The report highlights six funding and financing mechanisms that states and local governments can use to supplement, or in some cases replace, federal grants:

● Municipal bonds: Serving as a funding source for buyout programs by providing upfront capital to purchase disaster-prone properties and reduce long-term disaster risk.

● Locally assessed fees and taxes: Leveraging stormwater fees, special district fees, real estate transfer taxes, or targeted sales taxes to support ongoing buyout programs and match federal grants when available.

● Parametric insurance and catastrophe bonds: Securing fast, flexible payouts after a disaster through parametric insurance or catastrophe bonds.

● Safeguarding Tomorrow Revolving Loan Fund (STRLF): Capitalizing state-specific low-interest revolving loan funds that support flood mitigation and resilience projects.

● Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF): Typically administered by state environmental agencies, this could be a source of financing for post-buyout land restoration.

● Leveraging insurance claims: Using payouts from flood insurance or homeowners’ policies to offset acquisition costs and stretch limited public dollars further.

Those buyouts have helped remove thousands of repeatedly flooded homes, but the process is often so long and complex that many homeowners drop out or sell to the next unsuspecting buyer just to avoid the next disaster. Nationwide, previous NRDC research found that the average buyout project funded by FEMA has taken more than five years to complete, from the time a flood occurs until the project’s closing documents are filed.

“Federal cuts in disaster and climate-adaptation funding are creating a significant gap for communities nationwide,” said Kristin Marcell, Climigration Network Director. “State and local partners are asking for actionable, sustainable ways to fund voluntary home buyouts that help residents in dangerous situations move to safer, affordable homes. This report lays out practical alternatives and lessons from communities that can be applied and shared nationally.”

Most voluntary buyouts have been funded by FEMA, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and other federal programs. Since 1993, FEMA has provided more than $6.8 billion to support more than 45,000 buyouts, with most funds distributed after federal disaster declarations.

The report highlights places where local governments have taken the initiative to finance buyout programs like in North Carolina, where the Charlotte–Mecklenburg Stormwater Services (CMSWS) agency used stormwater fees to conduct buyouts using funding from a stormwater fee and acquired nearly 500 properties. New Jersey’s Blue Acres program focuses on voluntary buyouts of flood-prone properties. Since inception, the program has purchased approximately 1,200 properties (about 700 after Superstorm Sandy in 2012) and plans to acquire hundreds more using a mix of bonds, state appropriations, and federal funding. While the New York Office of Resilient Homes and Communities is administering the $250 million in bond funds to purchase flood prone properties from willing sellers, demolish and remove the structures, and facilitate the restoration and stewardship of these properties.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The CEOs of the Detroit Three automakers and a senior executive have been invited to appear at a Jan. 14 Senate hearing on the impact of auto regulations and vehicle prices, Reuters has learned.

CEO Mary Barra, CEO Jim Farley, Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa and Tesla Vice President of Vehicle Engineering Lars Moravy have been asked to appear at the previously unreported Senate Commerce Committee hearing that will review the impact of vehicle emissions and electric vehicle regulations on auto prices.

""This hearing will examine how government interference continues to make vehicles expensive and out of reach for American customers and how we can restore competition and choice,"" Senate Commerce Committee chair Ted Cruz said in a statement to Reuters, noting the average price of a car has more than doubled in the past decade.

The administration of President Joe Biden sought to prod automakers to build more expensive EVs by offering tax credits and imposing new regulations that also sought to deter future gas-powered production but also argued consumers would save money overall by not having to buy gas and on repairs.

Stellantis said it got the invitation but did not comment further. The other automakers did not immediately comment on whether they plan to appear at the hearing.

It would mark the first time the Detroit Three CEOs appear before Congress since 2008 when the automakers sought emergency government assistance when the industry faced near collapse.

Automakers face other headwinds for vehicle pricing including tariffs on imported vehicles, parts, aluminum and steel.

Cruz led efforts in Congress this summer to win approval for a provision in a tax and budget bill to eliminate penalties for automakers not meeting U.S. fuel economy standards dating back to 2022. The legislation also eliminates up to $10,000 in interest on new car loans for U.S.-assembled vehicles for most buyers.

The Trump administration has taken aim at vehicle environmental rules on a number of fronts. In June, Trump signed a resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act to bar California’s landmark plan to end the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035 and two other vehicle rules.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said last week the administration will soon propose rolling back NHTSA fuel economy rules from the 2022 through 2031 model years.",https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/trkd-images/LYNXMPELAH13T_L.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 17:02:03.108911

“Clean water is vital to community health and a fundamental right of every Pennsylvanian,” said DEP Secretary Jessica Shirley. “These projects are examples of good stewardship and best practices to create healthier streams and wetlands, reduce flood risk, and improve fish and wildlife habitat.”

The Section 319 Nonpoint Source Management Grant program, funded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and selected for by DEP, supports projects that carry out best management practices (BMPs) specified in Watershed Implementation Plans (WIP) for 44 watersheds around the state, with special consideration for projects in Pennsylvania’s share of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed. The program also supports development of new WIPs for additional impaired watersheds.

Nonpoint source pollution is water pollution that doesn’t come from a single specific discharge point, such as a pipe from a factory, but rather from diffuse sources, such as stormwater runoff, mine drainage, and farm fields. Around 53% of the water-quality-impaired watersheds in Pennsylvania are affected by nonpoint source pollution. Section 319 Nonpoint Source Management Grants focus on reducing:

Nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment pollution from agricultural activities, urban stormwater runoff, and streambank and shoreline erosion; and

Iron, aluminum, and acidity pollution associated with energy resource extraction and acid mine drainage (AMD).

Projects in the following counties received Section 319 Grant awards:

Berks County

Berks County Conservation District received $317,872 for the Upper Little Swatara Creek WIP Implementation project to do streambank restoration on Crosskill Creek and install agricultural BMPs on an unnamed tributary to Little Swatara Creek with Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission and USDA Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS). The Berks County Conservation District will implement a multi-year water quality monitoring program to determine and evaluate WIP progress. The estimated load reductions are 2,215 lbs./yr. of nitrogen, 5,901 lbs./yr. of phosphorus and 223 tons/yr. of sediment.

Columbia County

Columbia County Conservation District received $148,726 for the Catawissa WIP Revision project to update the Catawissa Creek WIP originally completed in 2007. The WIP revision will include both Columbia and Schuylkill counties and provide comprehensive and up-to-date information on water quality data, land use, remediation priorities, land reclamation efforts, pollutant load reductions, and construction of AMD treatment facilities.

Dauphin County

Tri-County Conewago Creek Association received $899,721 for the 2025 Conewago Creek Restoration Projects implement two priority stream restoration projects in the Conewago Creek watershed: 1st Unnamed Tributary North and Brills Run. The project will fund other stream restoration and agricultural BMPs in the watershed as willing landowners are identified through the Conewago Creek Initiative, a partnership of watershed stakeholders. The estimated pollutant load reductions are 3,853 lbs./yr. of nitrogen, 801 lbs./yr. of phosphorus, and 371 tons/yr. of sediment.

Indiana County

Indiana County Conservation District received $254,758 for the South Branch of Plum Creek WIP Revision project to revise the 2008 South Branch Plum Creek WIP by assessing water quality impairments. The assessment will guide the efforts to restore the watershed by locating the sources and causes of impairments and identifying and prioritizing BMP projects.

Lancaster County

Donegal Chapter of Trout Unlimited received $557,770 for the Woe, Miller, Young, and Stoltzfus Restoration project to construct three planned and permitted restoration sites and make minor repairs to instream structures. All four sites are included in the Conowingo Creek WIP. The estimated pollutant load reductions are 625 lbs./yr. of nitrogen, 570 lbs./yr. of phosphorous, and 188 tons/yr. of sediment.

Lebanon County

Trout Unlimited 108 – Doc Fritchey Chapter of Trout Unlimited received $457,727 for the Snitz Creek 3 - Stream & Floodplain Restoration project to stabilize 1,000 LF of unstable stream channel, reconnect to the adjacent floodplain, and establish 1.0 ac. of riparian buffer along with 1.2 ac. of wet meadow. The project will reduce pollutant loads to Snitz Creek from streambank erosion by approximately 75 lbs./yr. for nitrogen, 68 lbs./yr. for phosphorus and 22 tons/yr. for sediment.

Luzerne County

Eastern Pa. Coalition for Abandoned Mine Reclamation received $260,000 for the Conservation District Abandoned Mine Reclamation Program-East project to provide support in the mining-impacted watersheds of Northeast and Northcentral Pennsylvania to redevelop and reclaim abandoned mine lands, technical assistance, geographic information system mapping, 3D underground mine mapping, analysis and interpretation of anthracite and bituminous region mine maps, grant writing, grant management, education and outreach programs, community development, project coordination, and project management.

Schuylkill County

Schuylkill Conservation District received $221,600 for the Pine Forest Shaft Abandoned Mine Drainage (AMD) Treatment System Design project to collect updated stream flow, water quality data, and develop a final treatment system design and complete permitting for the Pine Forest Shaft AMD discharge.

The U.S., which backed the pledge two years ago, has renounced the idea of moving away from fossil fuels following last year’s election of President Donald Trump.
Other fossil-fuel-producing nations, such as Saudi Arabia, have attempted to frame the 2023 promise as something that falls short of a wholesale pivot away from consuming fossil fuels.
Even so, the U.N. said, concerted action to rein in heat-trapping pollution from fossil fuels and preserve and plant forests would help limit that overshoot.
Yet those same nations agreed two years ago to embark on a transition from fossil fuels, she said.","Even so, “this is a coalition of Global North and Global South … saying with one voice that this is an issue that cannot be ignored,” U.K. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said at a press conference.

The effort seeks to put teeth in a bold but nonbinding pledge from the 2023 climate summit in Dubai in which nearly 200 nations agreed to begin “transitioning away from fossil fuels.” While it is unclear what specific language, shape or form such a template could take, the nations backing the roadmap said it would offer more tangible metrics and guideposts for realizing the goal in hopes of limiting the dangerous rise in global temperatures.

Reaching a final deal at the COP30 summit in Belém, Brazil, will be challenging. And it would be even more daunting to get the world’s biggest energy-producing countries and their mix of state-run and multinational fossil fuel companies to follow suit.

For one thing, production of oil and gas has only increased since 2023, and fossil fuel use has remained stubborn amid growing energy needs in the developed and developing worlds. The U.S., which backed the pledge two years ago, has renounced the idea of moving away from fossil fuels following last year’s election of President Donald Trump.

Other fossil-fuel-producing nations, such as Saudi Arabia, have attempted to frame the 2023 promise as something that falls short of a wholesale pivot away from consuming fossil fuels.

In addition, the United Nations process requires unanimity, so any one country could derail the newest proposal.

“I think it’s a little bit premature to have a roadmap when we haven’t had a discussion on what a roadmap would constitute,” Adnan Amin, the CEO of the United Arab Emirates-led Dubai summit, told POLITICO on Tuesday. “If this is going to be yet another kind of directive coming out of the process without resources attached to it, that’s going to be very difficult to agree to at this meeting.”

Global temperatures have also continued rising, hitting 1.3 degrees Celsius of warming since the preindustrial era. The 2015 Paris Agreement had set an ambitious target of limiting warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius to limit catastrophic damage, but the U.N. predicted this year that temperatures will eclipse that line.

Even so, the U.N. said, concerted action to rein in heat-trapping pollution from fossil fuels and preserve and plant forests would help limit that overshoot.

The countries supporting a roadmap away from fossil fuels said those realities demand urgency and more specificity from nations that, to date, have offered 10-year climate strategies that fall far short of the 1.5-degree goal.

“I don’t want the COP to be a failure. We want this COP to succeed and we will continue pushing for this in some form,” Kenyan climate envoy Ali Mohamed told reporters. “I’m sure there is general understanding that it is important that the decision in Dubai is taken forward.”

The coalition backing the roadmap united governments that have often been crosswise with each other on several issues at these annual talks, chiefly over who shares the burden for quickly ditching fossil fuels and how to pay for shifting to cleaner energy sources.

Poorer countries such as Sierra Leone, which still have tremendous needs to improve their access to energy, joined the call because they already spend far too much of their slim budgets adapting to the effects of a hotter planet that impose costs on their citizens, said Jiwoh Abdulai, the nation’s environment minister.

“We still need to grow our economies to lift our people out of extreme poverty. But we are coming to the table. We want to be part of the solution,” he said. “Climate action and economic growth are not mutually exclusive.”

Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva “opened the door” when he called for such a roadmap earlier this month, said Vanuatu climate envoy Ralph Regenvanu. He called Lula’s announcement a “half” surprise given that Brazil, whose Congress is controlled by an opposing coalition, has backed more oil and gas exploration.

“His country is a big fossil fuel producer,” Regenvanu said in an interview. “It’s a personal thing for him. I don’t think it necessarily reflects Brazil, but it’s so great he said it because it gives us this opportunity.”

While some fossil-fuel-producing countries may present challenges in cementing a deal, U.K. climate envoy Rachel Kyte told reporters that has always been true. Yet those same nations agreed two years ago to embark on a transition from fossil fuels, she said.

The roadmap serves to mark progress and hold nations accountable to that goal, Kyte said.

“If you make this just about one side or the other, it doesn’t work politically, but it also doesn’t work in the real world,” she said. “At the moment, there’s more people that want to move through a road map process than there are not.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fb1%2Fcb%2F63db4bfc49c6ae688e1fae18c781%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2246580833,N,,2025-11-18 17:01:39.332682

Regulators in both states granted required water quality permits on Nov. 7 for the 37-mile Northeast Supply Enhancement project, despite growing opposition from environmentalists and previous permit denials in 2019 and 2020 over concerns the project would violate water quality standards.
On Tuesday, the Natural Resources Defense Council, as well as a coalition of New Jersey-based environmental groups, filed separate petitions in federal appeals court seeking review.
“New Jersey’s approval completely disregards its prior, sound decision to reject this pipeline over threats to the state’s water quality.
“New Jersey’s decision to approve NESE after repeatedly rejecting the same project is indefensible,” Miller said in a statement.","Environmentalists have asked a federal judge to review a key approval New Jersey regulators granted earlier this month that will allow an energy developer to proceed with a controversial $1 billion underwater natural gas pipeline project between New Jersey and New York.

Regulators in both states granted required water quality permits on Nov. 7 for the 37-mile Northeast Supply Enhancement project, despite growing opposition from environmentalists and previous permit denials in 2019 and 2020 over concerns the project would violate water quality standards.

On Tuesday, the Natural Resources Defense Council, as well as a coalition of New Jersey-based environmental groups, filed separate petitions in federal appeals court seeking review.

New Jersey’s Nov. 7 permit approval is “unjustifiable” because energy developer Williams, whose subsidiary Transcontinental Gas Pipeline Company first proposed the pipeline in 2017, did not remedy the reasons for the denials when it applied for permits again last June, the groups said.

They warned the underwater segment of the proposed pipeline, which would run beneath the Raritan Bay in the New Jersey-New York Harbor, would endanger marine habitats and dredge up sediments contaminated with mercury, copper, and polychlorinated biphenyls. The pipeline also would threaten wetlands and the environment in Somerset County, where Williams wants to build a compressor station, and Middlesex and Monmouth counties, where it would link existing pipelines between Pennsylvania and New York City, the groups said.

“New Jersey’s approval completely disregards its prior, sound decision to reject this pipeline over threats to the state’s water quality. This pipeline will not only destroy wetlands across New Jersey, but also would tear up the sea floor of Raritan Bay,” the NRDC’s Jared Knicley said in a statement. “We’re taking New Jersey to court to enforce the state’s water quality standards, which are incompatible with building this harmful pipeline.”

Williams said in a statement that the project is “critical to addressing persistent natural gas supply constraints in the Northeast” that have driven up consumers’ energy costs and deepened their reliance on alternatives like oil that are worse for the environment.

PHOENIX (Nov. 18, 2025) – The Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) Underground Storage Tank (UST) Program recently completed environmental site assessments that included the removal of abandoned, orphaned petroleum tanks from private properties in Ash Fork and Phoenix, using federal Brownfields funding. These long unused tank sites, with no identified owners or operators, posed potential environmental risks and barriers to redevelopment.

“Properties with abandoned underground storage tanks that have not been adequately assessed may have hidden environmental risks and could impact the potential for redevelopment,” said ADEQ Waste Programs Division Director Julie Riemenschneider. “Thanks to the grant from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) we were able to remove those tanks and give communities peace of mind knowing their land is safe for continued use.”

ADEQ completed the assessments in Oct. 2025 using approximately $450,000 from a $2 million Brownfields Assessment Grant awarded to ADEQ by the EPA. The grant is part of expanded federal resources through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which support state and local efforts to assess and restore underused or contaminated properties.

ADEQ reviewed historical records and available environmental data statewide to identify and prioritize sites for assessment. The review verified that no documentation existed showing the tanks had been properly and permanently closed and evaluated each site based on risk factors and the willingness of property owners to participate. ADEQ then used ground-penetrating radar to confirm the locations of the underground storage tanks which were then removed. The successful assessments eliminated potential hazards and cleared the way for safe redevelopment opportunities in Arizona.

In Ash Fork, one of the site cleanups cleared a small commercial parcel for potential reuse, while in Phoenix, the work addressed aging underground infrastructure in a mixed-use corridor.

“These projects demonstrate how environmental cleanup and community revitalization go hand in hand,” said ADEQ UST Manager Joey Kiker. “We’re excited to build on this momentum by assessing more orphan UST sites across Arizona to help more communities turn underused land into opportunities for growth.”

ADEQ plans to assess about 10 additional orphaned UST sites across Arizona as funding becomes available. These efforts help communities reclaim valuable land for redevelopment, align with ADEQ’s mission to protect public health and the environment, and ensure Arizona’s towns continue to grow safely and sustainably.

Under the final rule, the Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC) will become the permitting authority for Class VI wells statewide.

Federal and State Support for Texas Primacy The final rule garnered support from federal and state officials, who emphasized the potential benefits of granting Texas primacy.
Broader Trend Texas joins a growing list of states with Class VI primacy, including Louisiana, North Dakota, West Virginia, and Wyoming.","The rule positions the Railroad Commission of Texas as the primary permitting authority over Class VI wells and could expedite CCS projects in the state.

The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has approved Texas’s application to assume primary enforcement responsibility, or “primacy,” for Class VI underground injection control (UIC) wells within the state. Class VI UIC wells are used for the permanent geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide in deep underground rock formations. Under the final rule, the Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC) will become the permitting authority for Class VI wells statewide. For more details on the proposed rule to grant Texas primacy, see this Latham blog post.

EPA’s approval follows a comprehensive technical and legal review of Texas’s program revision application, which concluded that the state’s statutes, regulations, and administrative framework for permitting and regulating Class VI UIC wells meet the federal requirements under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Texas already administers UIC programs for other well classes. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality oversees Class I (deep waste disposal), III (mineral extraction), IV (hazardous waste in groundwater cleanup), and V (non-hazardous fluid disposal) wells. The RRC oversees certain Class V wells (shallow geothermal injection wells) and Class II (oil and gas waste disposal and enhanced oil recovery wells).

Class VI primacy could accelerate permitting for carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects by leveraging local technical expertise and Texas’s established regulatory infrastructure.

Federal and State Support for Texas Primacy

The final rule garnered support from federal and state officials, who emphasized the potential benefits of granting Texas primacy. RRC Chairman Jim Wright called it “an important step forward for [the] state’s energy sector” that could serve “to reduce regulatory overlap.” According to Senator John Cornyn, primacy allows Texas “to have more control over its own permitting process and improve efficiency.”

The RRC reports that it has already received 18 Class VI UIC well applications and is aware of additional projects being planned across the state.

Broader Trend

Texas joins a growing list of states with Class VI primacy, including Louisiana, North Dakota, West Virginia, and Wyoming. Most recently, EPA granted Arizona primacy for all UIC well classes. These approvals underscore a broader national trend toward state-level administration of CCS permitting.

What’s Next

EPA’s final rule will take effect December 15, 2025. Project proponents should track the RRC’s Class VI program implementation — including application forms, guidance, and timelines — and prepare to participate in state permitting processes.

Environmental Alert

(by Lisa Bruderly and Ethan Johnson)

On November 17, 2025, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Army Corps of Engineers (the Corps) proposed a revised definition of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS) under the Clean Water Act (Proposed Rule). The Trump administration announced that the Proposed Rule would “provide greater regulatory certainty and increase Clean Water Act program predictability and consistency.”

The new definition is expected to reduce the number of streams and wetlands that are regulated under the Clean Water Act and will impact several federal regulatory programs, including Section 404 permitting of impacts to regulated waters. The agencies drafted the Proposed Rule to closely mirror the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2023 decision in Sackett v. EPA, which held that the Clean Water Act extends to “relatively permanent” bodies of water connected to traditional navigable waters and wetlands with a “continuous surface connection” to those waters.

The Proposed Rule adds definitions for several terms, including “relatively permanent,” “tributary,” “continuous surface connection,” “prior converted cropland,” and “ditch.”

The public comment period will begin when the Proposed Rule is published in the Federal Register. If finalized, it will replace the Biden administration’s 2023 definition of WOTUS. The definition of WOTUS has changed several times in the last decade.

“I expect my business to reach national customers,” said Bagot. “I have an electric vehicle and know the struggles of charging on the road and range anxiety. I wanted to make an electric vehicle battery that could do more and go further.”

Medvient – Nicole Oliver

Medvient is an AI-driven healthcare platform designed to revolutionize medical billing, coding, and reimbursement. “Medvient replaces outdated, labor-heavy medical billing with AI-driven automation. Our platform uses a three-tier autonomous agent system that handles transcription, coding, compliance, and claim preparation with speed and precision. This reduces administrative costs, accelerates reimbursement, and gives providers a modern, reliable revenue cycle infrastructure,” said Nicole Oliver of Medvient.

“We are starting with a clear mission: support Louisiana clinics by modernizing their revenue cycle operations. From there, Medvient is built to scale regionally and nationally, particularly into rural and underserved areas that lack billing resources. Over time, our AI architecture can support global healthcare systems seeking faster reimbursement and reduced administrative burden,” said Oliver.

“Pitch Night is an opportunity to share our progress, connect with the region’s innovation ecosystem, and build relationships with partners and investors who believe healthcare deserves better technology. We aim to expand our pilot opportunities, increase visibility, and move Medvient closer to full deployment in clinical environments,” said Oliver.

“After 25 years working in revenue cycle operations, I saw how much time, money, and human energy are wasted on outdated billing systems. I built Medvient to solve the problems I’ve lived firsthand, using modern AI to create faster, more accurate, and more sustainable billing for healthcare providers,” said Oliver.

Intelligent Archives — Joseph Makkos

“Intelligent Archives converts one million pages of historic New Orleans newspapers into AI-ready datasets and story IP, creating a dual monetization engine that merges preservation with advanced machine learning and media production. It’s a new model where cultural heritage becomes high-value data infrastructure,” said Joseph Makkos of Intelligent Archives.

“We’re looking to build relationships with mentors, partners, and investors who understand both the commercial potential and cultural importance of ethical, high-quality training data and IP. Pitch Night offers visibility, validation, and strategic alignment for rapid growth,” said Makkos.

“After Katrina, I began rescuing historic New Orleans print ephemera and equipment. After acquiring the archives, I realized they weren’t just artifacts—they were powerful training data and narrative engines waiting to be activated. This work is driven by a belief that the future of AI and storytelling must be rooted in real human history,” said Makkos.

Regions Foundation Grant Announcement

The IDEAinstitute Fall 2025 Pitch Night will include the announcement of a major grant from the Regions Foundation, a nonprofit funded primarily by Regions Bank, in support of Idea Village initiatives.

About Entergy New Orleans Entergy New Orleans LLC is an electric and gas utility that serves Louisiana’s Orleans Parish.","As winter approaches and temperatures begin dropping, customers will begin using their heating systems more and this could lead to an increase in electricity usage. However, staying warm and comfortable does not have to come at the cost of high electric bills. By making a few simple changes around your home, you can improve its energy efficiency and keep costs down throughout the colder months.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, home heating and cooling costs can make up more than 52% of an average customer’s electric bill. In some cases, poor insulation, air leaks and inefficient HVAC systems can lead to even greater energy costs each year. To keep your home warm without significantly raising the thermostat, try these low to no-cost tips.

Improving energy efficiency with low-to-no-cost tips

Use solar energy: Open curtains on the south-facing windows during the day to allow sunlight to naturally heat the home and close them at night to reduce the chill from cold windows.

Insulate drafty windows: Use a heavy-duty, clear plastic sheet on a frame or tape clear plastic film to the inside of window frames and make sure the plastic is sealed tightly to the frame to help reduce infiltration.

Adjust the thermostat: When you are home and awake, set the thermostat as low as is comfortable, but when you are asleep or out of the house, turn the thermostat back to save on your heating and cooling bills.

Find and seal leaks: Seal air leaks around utility cut-throughs for pipes and recessed lights in insulated ceilings, and unfinished spaces behind cupboards and closets.

Maintain heating systems: Schedule routine service for home heating systems and replace furnace and heat pump filters once a month or as needed.

Reduce heat loss from the fireplace: Keep the fireplace damper closed unless a fire is burning and check the seal on the fireplace flue damper and make it as snug as possible.

By following these simple steps, you can stay warm and comfortable all winter long while keeping your bills under control. We also offer free comprehensive residential energy audits and rebates to help reduce the upfront cost of installing energy-efficient equipment.

Exploring resources through Bill Toolkit

To make sure customers have quick access to energy efficiency, bill management and financial assistance resources, Entergy created an online platform called Bill Toolkit. The platform consolidates helpful resources for customers interested in exploring ways to lower their electric use and costs and learn more about different payment options the company offers. It also provides information on our energy efficiency programs and incentives and rebates associated with these programs.

Tracking energy use through myAdvisor

Entergy customers can set electric usage alerts and monitor how much energy they use each day through bill management tools like myAdvisor, which is available through their myEntergy account online. Tracking usage over time can help customers identify trends that contribute to higher usage and budget their monthly expenses.

Smartphone maker Xiaomi said on Tuesday that its electric vehicle business had turned a quarterly profit for the first time, less than two years after launching its first car.

The Apple rival's EV, AI, and other new initiatives division reported a gross profit of $98.5 million for the quarter ending in September.

Revenues in the division hit a record high of $4 billion, with 28.3 billion yuan ($3.98 billion) coming from EV sales and 0.7 billion yuan ($98.5 million) from ""related businesses.""

Hitting profitability caps a meteoric rise for Xiaomi's EV venture.

Like Western rival Apple, the Chinese tech giant invested billions in building an electric car to rival Tesla and BYD — but unlike Apple, Xiaomi actually managed to ship an EV, launching the sleek SU7 sedan in March 2024.

The SU7 was a smash hit, selling over 130,000 units last year, and Xiaomi's second vehicle, a Tesla Model Y competitor called the YU7, amassed 240,000 preorders in 24 hours when it launched in June 2025.

Xiaomi has faced headwinds, with the company's stock price falling after a fatal crash involving an SU7 earlier this year, but sales have continued to grow. Xiaomi said on Tuesday it had delivered over 100,000 EVs in the third quarter, up from around 40,000 over the same period last year.

A tough road to profitability

Making money from selling EVs is notoriously difficult. By reaching profitability in under two years, Xiaomi has joined the small list of companies that have avoided the so-called ""Valley of Death"" that has claimed many promising EV startups.

Elon Musk's Tesla reported its first profitable quarter in 2013, around 10 years after the company's foundation and five years after Tesla began deliveries of its first vehicle, the Roadster.

It took Tesla another seven years to report a full year of profitability, during which the company nearly went bankrupt as it scaled up production of new models. Tesla reported $1.62 billion in operating income in the most recent quarter.

BYD, China's largest seller of EVs, has also been consistently profitable. The Chinese automaker reported $1.1 billion in net income in the third quarter and saw its revenues eclipse Tesla's for the first time last year.

However, BYD benefits from selling both hybrids and pure battery-electric vehicles, unlike Tesla and Xiaomi.

Other automakers have struggled to make money from building electric vehicles. Detroit giants Ford and GM continue to lose billions on their EV businesses, while startups Lucid and Rivian both reported losses of around $1 billion in the third quarter.

Even in China, where electric vehicle adoption is far ahead of the US, brutal price wars and cutthroat competition mean that only a few companies have managed to turn a profit.

Xiaomi rival Nio reported a net loss of nearly $700 million in the second quarter of 2025, while fellow EV startup Xpeng is closing in on profitability after cutting its own loss to just $50 million in the third quarter.",https://i.insider.com/691c6f56e1a9cbb014de65f6?width=1200&format=jpeg,N,,2025-11-18 17:02:27.790083

Car and Driver reached out to Kia, which confirmed the model had been postponed until further notice due to ""changing market conditions.""

It would have cost over $80,000, which is a hard sell in a world with no tax credits and potential import duties.

Kia was supposed to launch a hot GT version of the EV9 in the United States before the end of 2025. This top variant was supposed to have around 500 horsepower, drop the sprint time to just over 4 seconds and offer sporty visual touches to go with the extra performance. However, the EV9 GT won’t debut this year, and it’s now unclear if it’s ever coming to the U.S., due to “changing market conditions.""

Since the EV9 GT’s announced launch window was drawing to a close, Car and Driver reached out to the manufacturer, which confirmed it had been “delayed until further notice,” just like the EV4 sedan. That may mean it's not coming, since the U.S. luxury electric car market is cooling and selling expensive EVs is harder than it used to be, especially after the end of the $7,500 federal tax credit.

Tariffs may also play a role here. While both Hyundai and Kia manufacturer their high-volume EVs in the U.S., their performance products tend to come from Korea. The Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Kia EV6 are both built in the U.S., but if you want a hot Ioniq 5 N or EV6 GT, it'll come from Korea. If Kia planned the same split for the EV9, it's possible that the 15% tariff on imported South Korean cars made the plans unworkable.

The EV9 GT was expected to cost around $10,000 more than the most expensive current variant, the EV9 GT-Line, which costs $71,900. Kia likely thinks an even more expensive variant would not sell well enough to justify putting it on sale, especially since buyers in this segment probably don’t see the point in paying extra for an adjustable rear limited-slip differential, bigger brakes or better tires.

Kia also gave the EV9 GT electronically controlled suspension (ECS), which could make the car stiffer or softer depending on the driving mode, and it likely would have simulated a combustion engine, just like the revised EV6 GT, which was the first Kia to get this feature, inspired by the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N.

The revised rule narrows the scope of information to be reported and eliminates the reporting obligations faced by importers of PFAS-containing articles.

Practical Implications

If finalized, the revised rule would significantly narrow the universe of entities required to report and clarify the information required to be reported. Previously, entities that imported any amount of PFAS — even as part of an imported article — were required to gather information for more than a ten-year lookback period. Under the revised rule, article importers and entities generating PFAS only as impurities, byproducts or non‑isolated intermediates are no longer required to report. EPA has also created a de minimis exemption, meaning mixtures and articles that contain less than 0.1% PFAS are not required to report.

But the relief isn’t universal. EPA is maintaining the broad definition of PFAS for purposes of the rule and has proposed a compressed reporting window, beginning 60 days after adoption of the final rule and lasting just three months. Entities that remain in scope should plan accordingly.

Key Changes

EPA proposes several notable changes in the revised rule:

De minimis exemption: PFAS in mixtures or articles at less than 0.1% would be exempt. This exemption would apply regardless of the total production volume of the mixture or article.

Article import exemption: Importing PFAS as part of an article would no longer trigger reporting; the streamlined article‑importer form and extended deadline would be eliminated.

Alignment with TSCA exemptions: PFAS manufactured solely as byproducts, impurities or non‑isolated intermediates, and small‑quantity R&D production, would be exempt. PFAS-containing byproducts later used for commercial purposes remain subject to reporting requirements.

Product category updates: Consumer and commercial category names would be refined to reduce ambiguity.

Submission window changes: The reporting period would begin 60 days after the final rule’s effective date and run for three months; the special window for small manufacturers reporting only as article importers would be removed.

What Is Not Changing

EPA would retain the PFAS structural definition in 40 CFR 705.3 and the lookback period of Jan. 1, 2011 through Dec. 31, 2022. One‑time, substance‑specific reporting for PFAS manufacturers, including importers, not subject to an exemption will continue with no production‑volume threshold.

Call for Comments

EPA has requested public comments on several specific areas of the proposed rule, including the de minimis exemption, the imported articles exemption and the proposed change to the reporting window. Manufacturers affected by this rule should consider submitting comments by the Dec. 29, 2025 deadline.

SANTA CLARA, Calif. (Nov. 18, 2025) – Today, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing a settlement with Apple Inc. over claims of violations of federal hazardous waste law at a facility located on Scott Boulevard, Santa Clara, California. As a result of EPA’s action, the company addressed hazardous waste management and air emissions issues and has come into compliance with the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA).

“Hazardous waste regulations serve as critical safeguards for facility workers, communities, and the environment,” said EPA Pacific Southwest Enforcement and Compliance Assurance Division Director Amy Miller. “EPA’s actions will protect human health and the environment in the community of Santa Clara from the risk of hazardous waste.”

The Apple Inc. facility generates hazardous waste regulated under RCRA. In August 2023 and January 2024, EPA conducted inspections of the facility after receiving a tip and complaint from the public. During the inspections and reviews of facility records, EPA inspectors identified multiple violations of federal requirements for the management of hazardous waste.

These violations included failure to:

Properly characterize hazardous waste.

Identify land disposal restriction requirements and provide written notification of the restrictions.

Maintain a permit to store hazardous waste for more than 90 days.

Control air emissions from a solvent waste tank.

Properly label and date hazardous waste containers.

Follow hazardous waste container management standards.

Perform and document daily inspections of hazardous waste tanks.

Due to EPA’s action, the company updated the characterization and management of solvent waste, installed a device to control air emissions from the solvent tank, and resolved the remaining identified violations. The company will also pay a penalty of $261,283 to resolve EPA’s claims.

Background

Hazardous waste that is improperly managed poses a serious threat to human health and the environment. RCRA, passed in 1976, was established to set up a framework for the proper management of hazardous waste. EPA’s RCRA regulations work to protect humans and the environment from exposures to pollutants in hazardous waste.

Transmission lines rarely come to mind.
Digital Tools Driving Transmission Line Upgrades Modern digital design and modeling techniques are transforming how transmission lines are engineered and maintained.
That’s just a few examples of how deeply the economy and our everyday lives depend on a reliable power grid.
Utilities, regulators, and policymakers must work together to prioritize transmission upgrades, adopt and enforce modern design standards, and streamline permitting processes.","For decades, U.S. electricity demand was steady, allowing utilities to plan gradual growth and maintain the grid with modest upgrades. That era is over. The convergence of electric vehicles (EVs), data centers, technology advancements, and population growth and shifting is driving an unprecedented surge in electricity demand. According to the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA), electricity demand in the U.S. is projected to grow 50% by 2050, reflecting the greater imperative to modernize the transmission system.

This rising load is straining an aging grid. Many of the components that keep power flowing—wood and concrete poles, steel towers, conductors, cross-arms, and insulators—are well past their intended lifespans. Some transmission structures have been in service for more than 60 years, showing signs of rust, decay, and fatigue. The result is a system that is vulnerable to outages, bottlenecks, and costly delays in connecting new sources of clean energy.

Simultaneously, we are experiencing more and greater extreme weather events. Older transmission and distribution structures—and even more recent ones—were not designed for the meteorological loadings that our electric grid must handle today.

The U.S. grid was largely designed in the mid-20th century for a world where most electricity was generated by large, centralized fossil fuel plants and consumed in steady, predictable patterns. That grid was never built to handle today’s bidirectional power flows, distributed energy resources, or the sudden spikes in demand caused by high-performance computing. Modernizing the transmission grid is the only way to bring this mid-century network into the 21st century and prepare it for decades of growth.

The good news is that meeting growing electricity demand doesn’t require building new generation plants alone. Upgrading and optimizing existing transmission lines—the arteries that move electricity from generation sites to users—can increase capacity, improve efficiency, and strengthen grid reliability.

Infrastructure That Carries Renewable Energy

When most people think about the energy transition, they picture solar panels, wind turbines, or battery storage. Transmission lines rarely come to mind. Yet, these lines are the invisible highways of our power system. They carry electricity from remote wind farms and solar arrays to population centers, move power between regions, and provide redundancy when local generation falters.

This role is becoming even more critical as the grid shifts from centralized fossil fuel generation to distributed, renewable sources. Unlike coal or natural gas plants, which could be built near demand centers, wind and solar projects are often located hundreds of miles away. This means the electricity they produce must travel long distances to reach those who need it.

Without sufficient transmission capacity, clean energy projects are delayed, curtailed, or canceled altogether. The backlog of renewable projects waiting for grid interconnection is now one of the largest barriers to decarbonization.

Digital Tools Driving Transmission Line Upgrades

Modern digital design and modeling techniques are transforming how transmission lines are engineered and maintained. Sophisticated software now enables a single engineer to accomplish in months what once took a team of dozens years to complete, accelerating planning, reducing errors, and allowing upgrades to be completed quickly and efficiently.

The impact goes beyond efficiency. LiDAR (light detection and ranging) and high-resolution satellite imagery were already being used to model existing power corridors with unprecedented accuracy. After the Northeast blackout in 2003, which left 50 million people without power, utilities relying on digital tools were able to meet updated regulatory standards and strengthen system reliability. These technologies have been used to model more than 80% of high-voltage lines in the U.S. and Canada, improving both capacity and resilience.

By combining advanced software with detailed geospatial and engineering data, engineers can identify chokepoints, optimize upgrades, and prepare the grid to meet the growing demands of renewable energy, EVs, and data-driven infrastructure. Existing transmission and distribution lines can be modeled in a digital twin to quickly identify the areas that need to be strengthened to meet today’s weather events. These tools are helping the transmission and distribution system evolve from a reactive network into a modern, resilient backbone for America’s electrified future.

The Cost of Inaction

Neglecting the transmission system is not just an inconvenience, it is a risk to reliability and economic growth. The American Society of Civil Engineer’s (ASCE’s) recent infrastructure report card gave America’s energy grid a D-plus, citing aging equipment and lack of investment as key concerns.

Failing components can trigger cascading outages that leave millions without power. Today, the stakes are even higher. When the grid goes down, data centers go offline, commerce stops, and we can’t charge our cellphones or stream our favorite TV shows. That’s just a few examples of how deeply the economy and our everyday lives depend on a reliable power grid.

Utilities also face mounting pressure to connect large-scale data centers, which are power-hungry by design. By some estimates, supporting artificial intelligence (AI)-driven data centers alone will require an additional 35 GW of capacity by 2030, the equivalent of adding dozens of large power plants to the grid. Without significant transmission upgrades, this demand cannot be met.

Modernization Beats Greenfield Construction

One of the most effective ways to address these challenges is to upgrade and optimize existing transmission corridors. Replacing aging conductors with modern high-capacity wires, raising structures to meet newly required clearances, strengthening structures to meet updated safety and design codes, and re-rating lines can unlock significant capacity without waiting years for new rights-of-way.

This approach delivers several benefits, such as:

Speed. Utilities can add capacity in months rather than the years it can take to permit and build new lines.

Cost Savings. Upgrades are typically less expensive than building new generation or new transmission corridors.

Reduced Environmental Impact. Reusing existing rights-of-way minimizes the need for new land acquisition and lowers permitting complexity.

Improved Resilience. Modern materials and design standards help transmission and distribution systems withstand extreme weather and reduce maintenance costs.

To make this strategy work, though, utilities need accurate, high-resolution data on the current state of their assets. With aerial technology such as drones, engineers can create detailed models—digital twins—of existing systems, identify obstacles, and optimize upgrades before crews even step onsite. Modern digital modeling not only speeds planning and construction but also reduces risk, ensures compliance with updated standards, and unlocks additional capacity within existing transmission corridors.

Clearing the Permitting Bottleneck

Technical solutions alone are not enough. The permitting process for new transmission projects remains one of the most significant barriers to grid modernization. A single project crossing federal land can require approvals from dozens of agencies, leading to delays of 10 years or more.

Regulatory reform is essential. Streamlining reviews, setting clear timelines, and coordinating between agencies could dramatically accelerate critical projects. Policymakers and regulators have an opportunity to treat transmission upgrades with the same urgency as other national infrastructure priorities, recognizing their role in economic security and decarbonization.

Building the Workforce for the Grid of the Future

Upgrading the grid is also a workforce challenge. The transmission sector is facing a shortage of skilled engineers, line workers, and planners at the same time demand for their expertise is rising. Investment in workforce development will be just as important as investment in steel and concrete. Partnerships with universities, training programs for new technicians, and mentorship initiatives can ensure the next generation of engineers is prepared to tackle the complexity of grid modernization.

Technology can play a role here, too. Digital design and simulation tools allow junior engineers to experiment safely, learn from modeled scenarios, and build confidence before they work on live systems. A stronger, more skilled workforce will be essential to deliver projects on time and maintain reliability as the grid grows more complex.

Where We Go from Here

The U.S. is at an inflection point. The electricity grid we rely on every day is under strain from forces it was never designed to handle. At the same time, we have the tools, technology, and expertise to strengthen it if we act decisively.

Modernizing the transmission system is not just an engineering challenge; it is an economic and societal imperative. Investment in transmission delivers outsized returns in reliability, resiliency, and access to clean energy.

Utilities, regulators, and policymakers must work together to prioritize transmission upgrades, adopt and enforce modern design standards, and streamline permitting processes. By doing so, we can build a grid that is not only capable of meeting today’s demand but also ready for the reliable electrified future, supporting data centers, EVs, and technologies that have yet to be invented.

The grid is the backbone of modern life. Strengthening it now is the surest way to power the next chapter of American progress.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/fig1-power-lines-transmission-distribution-td.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 16:02:14.553715

“The confidence that Vulcan Elements has to expand to Johnston County is proof that we have the right assets to help innovative start-ups scale their businesses,” said Governor Josh Stein.
“North Carolina is a natural home for Vulcan Elements’ 10,000 metric ton facility,” said John Maslin, CEO of Vulcan Elements.
As home to our current commercial facility, North Carolina has proven that it has all three.
Vulcan Elements is also a 2025 recipient of a One North Carolina Small Business Program Matching grant that helped accelerate the company’s innovation, growth, and positioning for additional federal funding.","Today Governor Josh Stein announced Vulcan Elements Inc., a manufacturer of rare earth magnets, will invest $918.1 million in the town of Benson to expand its magnet production capacity and establish the largest magnet factory in the world outside of China. The company will add 1,000 new jobs to Johnston County.

“The confidence that Vulcan Elements has to expand to Johnston County is proof that we have the right assets to help innovative start-ups scale their businesses,” said Governor Josh Stein. “With semiconductor chips, batteries, and now magnets, North Carolina is building an innovation and manufacturing hub that will drive the economy of the future.”

Vulcan Elements opened its first facility in the Research Triangle Park to manufacture Neodymium Iron Boron rare earth magnets. These magnets convert electricity into motion and are required components for virtually all electronic devices. Along with semiconductors and batteries, rare earth magnets are critical components for almost all technologies that use motors, sensors, generators, or actuators – from hard disk drives, robotics, and drones to satellites, submarines, and nearly every defense system. The accelerating demand for advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, robotics, electric vehicles, and military systems, will support the company’s expansion into a 1 million-square-foot site in Benson. This manufacturing plant will achieve 10,000 metric tonnes of magnet production capacity and play a critical role in reshoring the magnet supply chain.

“North Carolina is a natural home for Vulcan Elements’ 10,000 metric ton facility,” said John Maslin, CEO of Vulcan Elements. “We need to draw on world-class talent, innovation, and infrastructure as we secure one of the 21st century’s most important supply chains. As home to our current commercial facility, North Carolina has proven that it has all three. As we create 1,000 new American jobs, we’ll tap into the region’s deep bench of experience across industries – from engineers and technicians who understand hardware and manufacturing to veterans who have spent their careers managing complex supply chains, operating heavy equipment, and serving their country.”

“This major expansion by Vulcan Elements is why North Carolina continues to be recognized as the best state to do business in America,” said N.C. Commerce Secretary Lee Lilley. “North Carolina brings a worldclass workforce, a business-friendly environment, and an incredible research network to support our shared goals of national security, innovation, and great jobs.”

New positions for the company include administrative, engineering, and production staff. These new jobs could create a potential annual payroll impact of more than $81.9 million for the region.

Vulcan Elements’ expansion in North Carolina will be facilitated, in part, by a Job Development Investment Grant (JDIG), which was approved by the state’s Economic Investment Committee earlier today. Over the course of the 12-year term of this grant, the project is estimated to grow the state’s economy by $2.6 billion. Using a formula that takes into account the new tax revenues generated by the new jobs and capital investment, the JDIG agreement authorizes the potential reimbursement to the company of up to $17,584,500, spread over 12 years. State payments occur only following performance verification each year by the departments of Commerce and Revenue that the company has met its incremental job creation and investment targets.

The project’s projected return on investment of public dollars is 65 percent, meaning for every dollar of potential cost to the state, the state receives $1.65 in state revenue. JDIG projects result in positive net tax revenue to the state treasury, even after taking into consideration the grant’s reimbursement payments to a given company.

Because Vulcan Elements chose a site in Johnston County, classified by the state’s economic tier system as Tier 3, the company’s JDIG agreement also calls for moving as much as $5,861,500 into the state’s Industrial Development Fund – Utility Account. The Utility Account helps rural communities anywhere in the state finance infrastructure upgrades necessary to attract future business.

The state also anticipates providing additional support to the project from the North Carolina General Assembly, including as much as $250,000 for road improvements.

“Vulcan Elements’ investment today is going to have a global impact as they become the first completely domestic producer of magnets needed for data centers, robotics, semiconductors, cars, and the new economy,” said Senator Benton Sawrey. “Johnston County is excited to be part of this journey, and Vulcan Elements can count on our community and transitioning military personnel to fill these positions and support its next phase of growth.”

“Announcements like this don’t happen by chance,” said Representative Larry C. Strickland. “We appreciate the partnership on both sides of the aisle, the careful preparation by the local officials, and the diligent work of the local and regional economic developers that contributed to Vulcan Elements’ decision to establish its $1 billion factory in Benson.”

In addition to the North Carolina Department of Commerce and the Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina, other key partners in this project include the North Carolina General Assembly, Commerce’s Division of Workforce Solutions, Commerce’s Office of Science, Technology & Innovation, the North Carolina Department of Transportation, the University of North Carolina System, the North Carolina Community College System, Johnston Community College, the Golden LEAF Foundation, South River Electric Membership Corporation, I-95/I-40 Crossroads of America Economic Development Alliance, Johnston County, the Johnston County Economic Development Corporation, and the Town of Benson.

The growth underscores its role as a core component of the global renewable energy transition.
Despite the positive outlook, the report identifies the intermittency of solar power as a primary restraint on market growth.
Authorities are also implementing Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) mechanisms to monetize clean energy generation and ensure compliance with renewable purchase obligations (RPOs).
The global solar energy market is on a trajectory for substantial growth, fueled by both technological and regulatory support.","The global solar energy market, driven by a push for carbon reduction and sustainable power generation, is projected to quadruple its valuation over the next decade, despite persistent challenges related to power generation variability, according to a new report from Allied Market Research.

The report estimates the market was valued at $0.4 trillion in 2024 and is forecast to reach $1.6 trillion by 2034. This growth trajectory reflects a compound annual growth rate of 15.2% from 2025 to 2034, fueled by technological advancements in photovoltaic (PV) systems, declining installation costs, and supportive government policies globally.

Solar energy, which accounts for approximately 8% of global electricity supply as of July 2025, is seen as a cost-effective and abundant alternative to fossil fuels. The growth underscores its role as a core component of the global renewable energy transition. The analysis attributes market expansion to ongoing technological integration with smart technologies and the overall push for energy independence among nations.

Despite the positive outlook, the report identifies the intermittency of solar power as a primary restraint on market growth. The variable and non-continuous nature of generation, caused by weather changes, seasons, and the day-night cycle, complicates the task for grid operators who must continuously balance supply and demand.

Regions with high solar penetration have seen the effects of this variability. The report notes that unexpected surpluses in areas like California and Australia have at times driven wholesale power prices into negative territory. Conversely, sudden drops in output strain grid stability, increasing the risk of power outages, such as those observed in Spain and Portugal earlier in 2025. Energy systems designed for predictable sources must adapt to manage these fluctuations, which are exacerbated by prediction errors from abrupt cloud cover or storms.

Governments worldwide are implementing a comprehensive regulatory landscape to manage and accelerate solar adoption. These frameworks include Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) and feed-in tariff (FiT) schemes that mandate or incentivize utilities to source power from solar energy. Financial measures like investment tax credits (ITC) and production tax credits (PTC) are also utilized to lower initial investment barriers and attract both domestic and foreign capital, according to the report.

Further regulatory oversight includes establishing strict grid interconnection codes to ensure reliable integration and prevent instability. Authorities are also implementing Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) mechanisms to monetize clean energy generation and ensure compliance with renewable purchase obligations (RPOs).

A significant growth opportunity highlighted in the research is Building-integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV). BIPV involves seamlessly incorporating PV panels into a building’s elements, such as windows, roofs, and façades, allowing the material to serve both as a structural component and a power-generating system. This approach is particularly relevant for commercial and high-rise buildings where traditional rooftop space is limited.

Illustrating this emerging technology, Microquanta launched a perovskite panel BIPV project in Shanxi, China, in February 2025. The installation, located at the University Student Entrepreneurship Center, has a capacity of 17.92 kilowatts peak (kWp) and uses double-glass perovskite modules engineered for approximately 40% light transmittance.

The global solar energy market is on a trajectory for substantial growth, fueled by both technological and regulatory support. Its long-term expansion hinges on the successful implementation of effective solutions, such as advanced energy storage and grid management systems, to counteract the operational complexities posed by the inherent variability of solar power generation, according to the market research.

The Texas Energy Buyers Alliance Club previously reported that blocking future renewable energy and storage deployment would result in an estimated $115 billion in higher wholesale prices for Texans over the next 15 years.","Federal policies targeting renewable energy are causing catastrophic damage to development in Texas, the nation’s leading solar and energy storage state, said the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).

SEIA has released an analysis indicating that new federal policies targeting renewable energy are placing a significant majority of planned solar and battery storage capacity in Texas at severe risk. The data suggests that up to two-thirds of the state’s future clean energy portfolio could be indefinitely stalled due to a combination of regulatory and financial headwinds.

The primary factors cited for this development risk include the administrative slowdown of federal permitting processes, the rollback of critical investment tax credits, and the cancellation of the $7 billion Solar for All grant program. Solar has taken a hit from political attacks, including the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and executive and agency actions aimed at curbing solar development. After years of growth, Wood Mackenzie forecast that solar installations may decline 1% annually through 2035.

This policy environment is creating profound uncertainty for developers and investors operating within the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) jurisdiction.

The consequences are quantified for both the near and intermediate term. SEIA’s analysis projects that over 13,000 MW of planned solar and co-located battery capacity will likely fail to come online in 2026, representing half of all scheduled clean energy projects in the state for that period.

The capacity at risk escalates significantly for projects scheduled for 2027, where the share jumps to over 22,500 MW out of the 26,000 MW planned. In total, 165 individual projects in Texas have been identified as facing significant development risk.

The challenge is systemic and national. According to SEIA’s findings, more than 70 GW of solar and 40 GW of battery projects across the entire U.S. pipeline have not secured all necessary federal, state, and local permits. This substantial capacity is at risk of slowdown due to the new administrative priority on fossil fuels.

The report from SEIA tracks planned capacity and what is at risk state-by-state on a dashboard here.

The potential loss of this grid-strengthening capacity in Texas is projected to incur direct costs for consumers. The Texas Energy Buyers Alliance Club previously reported that blocking future renewable energy and storage deployment would result in an estimated $115 billion in higher wholesale prices for Texans over the next 15 years.

SEIA president stated that these “political attacks on solar and storage are putting half of all power planned to come onto the grid this decade at risk,” directly impacting grid resilience and economic competitiveness as electricity demand, particularly from data centers, continues to rapidly increase.

Solar and storage projects developed on federal lands now face “final review” from Trump-appointed Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum’s office, leaving many to be “trapped in limbo,” said SEIA.

“And this extends well beyond projects on public lands,” said SEIA. “Many solar and storage projects located partially or entirely on private property are now being entangled in a myriad of federal reviews.”

SEIA said federal obstruction erodes private property rights and local decision-making, inserting Washington bureaucrats into projects that landowners and communities want to host. It poses a risk to landowners, farmers, ranchers, and private investors that even if your project complies with regulations the federal government can still pull the plug, said SEIA.",https://pv-magazine-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/michael-pointner-9XNbOxsSIrw-unsplash1-2048x1365-1-1200x800.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 15:01:46.705774

Policy Success and Safe Oversight These gains in offshore oil output are the direct result of policy decisions and regulatory reforms put in place since President Trump took office.
“BSEE’s role is to make sure offshore energy projects advance safely and responsibly,” said BSEE Principal Deputy Director Kenneth Stevens.","“These developments underscore the success of American Energy Dominance policies in not only expanding domestic energy supplies and creating jobs but also in boosting the economy and reducing reliance on foreign oil—all while maintaining the highest safety and environmental standards,” said Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management Leslie Beyer.

Gulf of America: Record Production with New Deepwater Projects

In the Gulf of America, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement has overseen several important projects brought online in 2025. Besides Salamanca, Shell’s Whale platform achieved first oil in January and is designed to produce up to 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day at peak. Joining Whale in this year’s lineup is Beacon Offshore Energy’s Shenandoah, a high-pressure deepwater development in the Walker Ridge area off Louisiana, which began oil and natural gas production in July. Shenandoah is designed for 120,000 barrels per day of production capacity, making it one of the most significant new oil producers in the Gulf. In April, Chevron’s Ballymore field came online as a subsea tie-back to an existing facility and added up to 75,000 barrels per day.

Noticeably, LLOG Exploration’s Salamanca hub in Keathley Canyon marks the first-ever refurbishment and reuse of a decommissioned floating production unit in the Gulf. Rather than build a platform from scratch, the Salamanca project transformed a previously retired facility into a modern oil hub—significantly reducing the time, cost, and emissions required to bring a facility online. The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement Floating Production Unit has an output capacity of about 66,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The bureau oversaw rigorous safety reviews of the refurbished platform and new equipment, ensuring that this pioneering project meets all standards as it contributes new barrels to US oil production.

“We’re seeing the payoff of a bold offshore energy blueprint,” said Beyer. “From cutting-edge deepwater platforms to creative reuse of existing units, industry is answering the call to maximize domestic oil production. Under President Trump’s leadership, the Gulf is again proving itself as a cornerstone of American energy security, ensuring a stable and reliable energy supply.”

Pacific Offshore: A Comeback After a Decade

For the first time in ten years, offshore oil production has resumed in the Pacific Outer Continental Shelf from the Santa Ynez Unit. Platform Harmony restarted operations in 2025 following thorough inspections, infrastructure checks, and pipeline safety reviews by the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement. This restart restores an important source of domestic energy supply while ensuring that safeguards are in place to protect workers and the coastal environment.

Arctic Oversight: Safeguarding Frontier Resources

In the Arctic Outer Continental Shelf, the bureau continues to oversee oil production from the Northstar Unit in the Beaufort Sea.

The Arctic represents both opportunity and responsibility, and the bureau’s oversight ensures that any new development in the region proceeds with careful attention to worker safety, environmental protection, and community concerns.

Policy Success and Safe Oversight

These gains in offshore oil output are the direct result of policy decisions and regulatory reforms put in place since President Trump took office. Early in the Administration, the President and Secretary of the Interior outlined a blueprint aimed at maximizing the nation’s untapped oil and gas potential on federal lands and waters. In offshore regions, this translated into actively encouraging new projects, streamlining permitting processes, and removing unnecessary obstacles—all while enforcing stringent safety and environmental standards.

The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement has implemented initiatives like “Dominance by Design,” a collaborative program with industry to modernize offshore oversight and improve the efficiency of approvals for important projects. By collaborating with operators, the bureau ensured that innovations such as high-pressure deepwater wells and technology-driven production techniques (e.g., downhole commingling) could be deployed quickly under effective supervision.

Safety and environmental protection have remained paramount even as development accelerates. Each new production facility underwent comprehensive engineering reviews, and bureau inspectors were on-site for critical milestones—from pre-commissioning tests on the refurbished Salamanca platform to pipeline integrity checks and spill response readiness in California.

“BSEE’s role is to make sure offshore energy projects advance safely and responsibly,” said BSEE Principal Deputy Director Kenneth Stevens. “The start-up of Salamanca, the resumption of Pacific production, and ongoing oversight in the Arctic show that we can and will expand domestic resources while protecting workers, communities, and the environment.”

“What piqued my interest was service members with repeated drug use or absence offenses,” Brooker says.
One day, while reading the on-base newspaper, Brooker learned about the Funded Legal Education Program, which pays for law school for service members who want to join the JAG Corps.
“When I got offered the clinic, I decided to take cases to help some of the people I was defending when I was in service,” Brooker says.
This includes reviewing military records, interviewing fellow service members, and understanding the culture of the unit at the time.","When Eve Richardson began working with the Military and Veterans Law Clinic at the UNC School of Law in 2019, clinic director and law professor John Brooker asked her a simple but powerful question: “What do you want to get out of this?”

Like many of Brooker’s clients, Richardson had endured traumatic experiences during her time in the U.S. military. But when she enlisted in the Army in the early 1980s, she was filled with hope.

After completing basic training, she served as a cook in the mess hall and quickly proved her talent, winning several cooking competitions. Her dedication and skill propelled her through the ranks, rising from private to sergeant in just three years. She was even stationed in Germany for a time.

“It was fabulous — until it wasn’t,” she recalls.

Richardson became trapped in an unhealthy relationship with another service member that led to severe depression and anxiety. It took time to recognize the toll it was taking on her, and when she finally decided to end the relationship, she found little support from the military.

“To be a victim you have to know you’re a victim,” Richardson says. “When people tell you it’s your fault, you begin to believe it.”

Then came a crisis: Her young son was hospitalized with kidney problems. Richardson stayed by his side for nearly a month. For that, she was arrested for absence without leave. Her options? Face time in a military prison or accept an other than honorable discharge.

She chose the latter — despite having served her country faithfully for nearly eight years.

Richardson’s story is not unique. Brooker, who spent 15 of his 20 years in the U.S. Army working as a Judge Advocate General (JAG) officer, has heard many like it.

“What piqued my interest was service members with repeated drug use or absence offenses,” Brooker says. “Those are the two big reasons for other than honorable discharges, and I’ve seen this situation over and over again — especially with people who have trauma from war that impacts their judgement.”

Historically, the military has struggled to fully understand how conditions like major depressive disorder, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, racism, and assault trauma affect mental health.

These conditions often contribute to other than honorable (OTH) discharges, which are issued for misconduct such as security violations, assault, abuse of authority, or drug use. As a result, service members with OTH discharges can lose access to critical veteran’s benefits, like health care and disability pay, and face long-term barriers to employment, as the discharge remains on their permanent record much like a criminal conviction.

“In the civilian world, being late to your job can’t get you sent to jail and likely won’t leave a permanent mark on your character,” says Jillian Foye, a third-year law student who works in the clinic. “But if you’re in the military, that’s exactly what happens.”

Today, an estimated 400,000 service members are at risk of being denied access to benefits they’ve earned, according to the Legal Services Center at Harvard Law School. The UNC Military and Veterans Law Clinic is working to change that, one case at a time, by helping veterans upgrade their discharge status. It’s a vital service in North Carolina, where nearly 10% of adults are active duty or former military personnel, or work as civilians for the U.S. Department of Defense.

Understanding the roots of these injustices — and how to fight them — became a personal mission for Brooker, shaped by his own journey through the military ranks and legal system.

From ROTC to JAG

Growing up in Durham, Brooker learned about the Army ROTC scholarship, which offers free tuition in exchange for military service after graduation, from a recruiter. He earned a nearly full ride to Wake Forest University, where he studied politics and history, and was commissioned as an Army officer in 1998.

He began his military career in the Transportation Corps — a logistics branch responsible for moving personnel and supplies via trucks, trains, planes, and boats — at Fort Eustis, Virginia. There, he oversaw watercraft operations on the Atlantic Ocean.

“I loved every minute of it,” Brooker says, grinning.

One day, while reading the on-base newspaper, Brooker learned about the Funded Legal Education Program, which pays for law school for service members who want to join the JAG Corps.

“It seemed too good to be true,” he says. “It meant I’d owe two years in the Army for every year I was in law school. But I really loved the Army and what I was doing at that point.”

Members of the JAG Corps serve as prosecutors, defense attorneys, and judges in military trials. They also work in the Army Legal Assistance Office, which provides free legal representation to soldiers, family members, and retirees.

Brooker enrolled at the UNC School of Law in 2000. Just one year later, he witnessed a dramatic shift in the military — from peacetime on September 10, 2001, to wartime on September 11. After graduating in 2003, he joined the JAG Corps and went on to complete two combat tours in Iraq.

“I had to learn how to do legal work overseas,” Brooker says. “Like, how do you have a trial when you don’t have a courtroom? In one instance, we actually built one in Baghdad at a small operating base because our witnesses were there. The war changed the daily nature of what we did all day, every day.”

Returning to his roots

During his time in the Army, Brooker handled many cases involving minor offenses that would be overlooked in civilian life but were punished harshly in the military, such as one-time drug use or absence from duty. These offenses often led to OTH discharges, which could severely impact a service member’s benefits.

“I was very cognizant that an other than honorable discharge could take away someone’s benefits forever,” Brooker shares. “So I’d try to be on the side of the soldier.”

Toward the end of his military career, Brooker was stationed in Charlottesville, Virginia, home to the U.S. Army’s Judge Advocate General’s Legal Center and School. He received his Master of Laws degree and worked on the faculty there, where he collaborated with two colleagues to write a book-length guide for the Military Law Review on benefit eligibility for OTH discharges.

“In a way, we’d like to think we cracked the code,” he says.

This work caught the attention of former UNC School of Law Dean Martin Brinkley, who called Brooker in 2018 to offer him a job running the Military and Veterans Law Clinic. It was too good to turn down, according to Brooker.

“When I got offered the clinic, I decided to take cases to help some of the people I was defending when I was in service,” Brooker says. “At that time, there was a lack of understanding of how mental health conditions impacted behavior. And now, we can go back, explain what happened, and ask the military to upgrade their discharge statuses.”

Building cases, changing lives

Research in the clinic involves working closely with clients to help them build a case for discharge status upgrades. This includes reviewing military records, interviewing fellow service members, and understanding the culture of the unit at the time.

“Sometimes you’re searching through thousands of pages of service and treatment records,” says Mya Fernandez, a third-year law student who works in the clinic. “You need to understand the Department of Defense language and the code of regulations for the Veterans Benefits Administration.”

“It’s similar to historical research,” Brooker adds. “You’re looking back at facts from the past to construct a narrative of what happened.”

For veterans who served in the 1960s, for example, the team must research the military’s stance on civil rights, the state of mental health care, and other factors that could have influenced discharge — such as exposure to Agent Orange, a toxic herbicide used during the Vietnam War.

To strengthen their cases, clinic students and staff collaborate with a network of interdisciplinary experts. Kimberly Tran, a licensed clinical psychologist and adjunct professor in the clinic, guides students to develop mental health arguments. They also consult with providers from Carolina’s Transforming Health and Resilience in Veterans Program on traumatic brain injuries and work with addiction specialists to address substance use issues.

“Professor Brooker not only helps us learn the unique ways this study of law works, but gives us the agency to represent our clients,” Jillian Foye, another student in the clinic, says. “There’s this phrase in law we hear often: Be a zealous advocate for your client. Professor Brooker truly embodies this. He cares so deeply about all clients within the clinic. And he makes it a point to help us have that same kind of energy.”

Expanded transformer factory

Hitachi Energy is carrying out a comprehensive expansion of the transformer factory in Ludvika, which represents one of the largest investments ever at the site. The expanded factory will have an area of 20,000 m² and is designed to significantly increase capacity and enable the production of more large power transformers (AC and DC) worldwide.

The expanded factory will significantly increase the production capacity for large power transformers by approximately 40%. The factory will receive new, state-of-the-art equipment and improved production flows, including separate unloading areas for trains and trucks to streamline logistics. This expansion will create approximately 300 new jobs, and recruitment and training of personnel has already started. A dedicated Training Center has also been established to ensure structured and safe training for new employees. The project is expected to be completed in the fall of 2027.

Lawmakers passed fiscal 2026 spending bills for three federal agencies, including the U.S. Department of Agriculture and its RUS programs.
“Electric co-ops use RUS loans to help finance infrastructure that provides reliable, affordable service to more than 42 million consumer-members in rural communities throughout America,” Thomas said.
The RUS Electric Loan Program dates back to 1936, when Congress passed the Rural Electrification Act that created electric co-ops.
The Farm Bill authorizes crucial RUS funding for co-ops and helps accelerate broadband deployment across rural America.","Congress has increased funding from $6.5 billion to $7 billion for the Rural Utilities Service Electric Loan Program, which helps electric cooperatives pay for construction, improvement and modernization of their systems.

The $500 million boost was approved as part of the deal that Congress reached to reopen the federal government after a record 45-day shutdown. Lawmakers passed fiscal 2026 spending bills for three federal agencies, including the U.S. Department of Agriculture and its RUS programs. President Donald Trump signed the package into law Nov. 12.

NRECA and electric co-ops pushed for the funding increase and will continue to advocate for more money for the program after the current spending bill ends on Sept. 30, said Hill Thomas, NRECA vice president for legislative affairs.

“Electric co-ops use RUS loans to help finance infrastructure that provides reliable, affordable service to more than 42 million consumer-members in rural communities throughout America,” Thomas said. “The funding increase approved by Congress will help co-ops expand their systems to keep up with rising demand for electricity.”

Co-ops also help reduce the federal deficit by paying interest on those loans to the U.S. Treasury, Thomas said. In 2024, they paid nearly $200 million in interest.

The RUS Electric Loan Program dates back to 1936, when Congress passed the Rural Electrification Act that created electric co-ops. RUS offers loans to not-for-profit co-ops at low interest rates.

“Many co-ops rely on these loans to modernize their systems without having to raise rates dramatically to pay for the improvements,” Thomas said.

As part of the deal to reopen the government, Congress also extended the existing Farm Bill for another year, through Sept. 30, 2026. Lawmakers last passed a five-year Farm Bill in 2018. They have been unable to agree on a new one, opting instead to extend the 2018 legislation each year for the past three years.

The Farm Bill authorizes crucial RUS funding for co-ops and helps accelerate broadband deployment across rural America.

Losing those protections could affect drinking water for millions of Americans.
Those are the ones that sit dry for most of the year but fill up after rainfall or snowmelt, providing more than half of the water flowing through most river systems used in our drinking water.
“Wetlands are sort of the unsung heroes of the planet because they store carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change,” Maxine told me.
The proposal could affect up to 55 million acres of wetlands — roughly the area of Utah.","In a new proposal, the Trump administration wants to strip federal protections from millions of acres of wetlands and streams, making it easier to pollute them. Losing those protections could affect drinking water for millions of Americans.

The proposal, should it be finalized in the coming months, would deliver a victory to businesses and industries that want to scale back the Clean Water Act of 1972, which Congress passed to protect all “waters of the United States.” The beneficiaries could be real estate developers eager to build on shorelines, farmers with fields that run along waterways and manufacturers who make petrochemicals in vast factories set on tidal marshes.

“Today’s proposal is going to be met with a lot of relief” from those businesses and landowners, Lee Zeldin, the E.P.A. administrator said. But what about the rest of the country?

My colleague Maxine Joselow, a climate policy reporter, covered the announcement of the proposal, which could exclude from federal protection wetlands that sit beside what are known as “intermittent” or “ephemeral” streams. Those are the ones that sit dry for most of the year but fill up after rainfall or snowmelt, providing more than half of the water flowing through most river systems used in our drinking water.

“Wetlands are sort of the unsung heroes of the planet because they store carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change,” Maxine told me. “They also provide food, shelter and breeding grounds for a variety of species, including endangered species like the Florida panther and the whooping crane.” They not only provide drinking water, but they also protect against flooding by absorbing tidal surges during storms.

The environmentalist response

Environmentalists are ripping mad. The proposal could affect up to 55 million acres of wetlands — roughly the area of Utah.

The disagreement comes down to a debate over what constitutes “waters of the United States,” which Maxine told me is known by water policy nerds as WOTUS. The Obama administration widened the scope of the Clean Water Act to protect the headwaters of rivers and smaller streams that aren’t always full of water. (A farmers’ advocacy group ran an ad campaign featuring rubber ducks to protest the E.P.A.’s definition: “If you can’t #FloatUS, it’s not a WOTUS,” the ads declared.) In Trump’s first term, the E.P.A. repealed that rule. Then, a Supreme Court ruling in 2023 made it hard again for Democratic administrations to strengthen the protections.

And now many more acres of waterways may not be either. The National Association of Home Builders cheered the possibility, Maxine said. The group’s chairman told her the administration’s proposal would help in “reducing regulatory red tape, cutting permitting costs and lowering the cost of doing business in communities across the country.”

Beyond wetlands

Trump has repeatedly said he wants “clean air and clean water.” But several decisions are expected to have the opposite effect, Maxine said.

Last month, the government said it would open the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil and gas drilling. And just last week the administration announced that drilling would also be allowed in a pristine, remote stretch of tundra and wetlands in the northern part of the state that is among the Arctic’s most important wildlife habitats.

Why? Officials say that environmental concerns should not necessarily supersede the needs of the nation’s economy. The decision to drill in Alaska, for instance, would “unlock Alaska’s energy potential, create jobs for North Slope communities and strengthen American energy security,” according to Doug Burgum, the secretary of the interior.

For the first time, researchers have devised a technique to track the world’s most famous insect migration. They’re outfitting monarch butterflies with featherweight radio tags, powered by the sun, to track their journeys to winter colonies in Mexico. The tags weigh just 60 milligrams (about as much as a grain of cooked rice).

The tech could shed light on the poorly understood life cycles of hundreds of butterfly species, plus bees and other insects, at a time when many are declining. “There’s nothing that’s not amazing about this,” said Cheryl Schultz, a butterfly scientist at Washington State University.

It’s good news for insect enthusiasts, too: A free app lets you follow the progress of individual butterflies. Many are coasting over cities and suburbs; they’re finding pollinator gardens and stopping in winter hideaways.

Today’s $912 million is the first concrete allocation from that commitment, and it’s going exactly where market demand exists—hybrid production capacity.
The real question now is how long Detroit’s Big Three can sustain their EV losses while Toyota expands profitable hybrid production.","Toyota announced a $912 million investment across five U.S. manufacturing plants to expand hybrid vehicle production capacity, creating 252 new jobs and marking the first U.S. production of hybrid-electric Corollas. The investment, revealed Tuesday, comes just six weeks after the federal EV tax credit expiration sent competitors’ pure-electric strategies into freefall.

The timing couldn’t be more strategic. While General Motors lays off thousands and idles battery plants, Ford discusses canceling the F-150 Lightning, and Stellantis indefinitely delays facilities, Toyota is expanding manufacturing capacity for the hybrid technology it never abandoned—even when critics mocked the approach as backward-looking.

Investment Spreads Across Five Southern Plants

Toyota’s manufacturing expansion allocates funding to facilities in West Virginia, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Missouri, with production beginning in 2027 and 2028.

West Virginia’s Buffalo plant receives the largest allocation at $453 million, adding 80 jobs to increase assembly of four-cylinder hybrid-compatible engines, sixth-generation hybrid transaxles, and rear motor stators. The facility currently produces over one million engines, transmissions, and hybrid transaxles annually.

Kentucky’s Georgetown plant—Toyota’s largest facility globally—gets $204.4 million and 82 jobs for an all-new machining line producing four-cylinder hybrid-compatible engines. The plant can assemble up to 700,000 powertrain units annually and employs nearly 10,000 team members.

Mississippi’s Blue Springs plant will receive $125 million to begin producing hybrid-electric Corollas, marking the first electrified Corollas assembled in the United States. The plant currently employs 2,400 workers.

Tennessee’s Jackson casting plant receives $71.4 million and 33 jobs to increase production of hybrid transaxle cases, housings, and engine blocks. Three new production lines will increase capacity by nearly 500,000 units annually.

Missouri’s Troy casting plant gets $57.1 million and 57 jobs for a new cylinder head production line for hybrid vehicles, increasing plant capacity by more than 200,000 cylinder heads annually.

Part Of Broader $10 Billion U.S. Commitment

The $912 million represents the first concrete allocation from Toyota’s $10 billion additional investment plan announced November 13, when the automaker opened its $13.9 billion North Carolina battery plant. That facility produces batteries primarily for hybrid vehicles—not pure EVs—positioning Toyota perfectly for the post-subsidy market.

“Customers are embracing Toyota’s hybrid vehicles, and our U.S. manufacturing teams are gearing up to meet that growing demand,” said Kevin Voelkel, senior vice president of manufacturing operations at Toyota Motor North America.

Electrified vehicles, including hybrids, plug-in hybrids, and all-electric models, now account for nearly 50% of Toyota’s U.S. sales. The company currently assembles about half the vehicles it sells in the U.S., with North American facilities producing more than three-quarters of vehicles sold domestically.

Strategic Timing Amid Competitor Retreat

The investment arrives as the American automotive landscape undergoes a dramatic transformation following the September 30, 2025 expiration of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit. Congress eliminated the incentive through President Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” fundamentally altering EV economics overnight.

October EV sales collapsed 24% compared to September as buyers confronted the full cost of electric vehicles without subsidies. General Motors announced it would lay off more than 3,400 workers across battery plants and EV facilities, with CFO Paul Jacobson stating the company expects “EV demand growth to slow pretty significantly.”

Ford’s F-150 Lightning faces potential cancellation with production halted indefinitely. The company’s Model E electric vehicle division lost $3.6 billion through the first nine months of 2025, contributing to $13 billion in cumulative EV losses since 2023.

Ram parent Stellantis canceled plans for a fully electric Ram 1500 earlier this year, pivoting instead to an extended-range EV that includes a gas engine.

Validating Multi-Pathway Strategy Critics Dismissed

Toyota’s investment validates a strategy the company maintained despite criticism from EV advocates who argued the automaker was moving too slowly on electrification. Chairman Akio Toyoda has long advocated for diversifying investments across multiple powertrain technologies rather than betting exclusively on battery-electric vehicles.

“There are many ways to climb the mountain that is achieving carbon neutrality,” Toyoda said at the 2023 Japan Mobility Show, defending the company’s approach as competitors rushed toward pure-EV futures.

The company has been methodically converting models to hybrid-only versions since at least 2024. The 2025 Camry is available exclusively as a hybrid, while the Land Cruiser and Sienna minivan already offer only hybrid powertrains. Toyota’s hybrid sales skyrocketed from 9% of total sales in 2018 to 37% by mid-2023.

Hybrid technology typically adds less than $2,000 to a vehicle’s retail price while offering more power than gasoline-only counterparts and avoiding the range anxiety and charging infrastructure dependency that has deterred mainstream EV buyers.

EVXL’s Take

Toyota’s $912 million hybrid investment isn’t just another manufacturing announcement—it’s a vindication tour. This is the automaker that was mocked for being “behind” on EVs, criticized for its cautious approach, and accused of climate obstruction for not abandoning internal combustion engines fast enough. Turns out Toyota was reading the market while competitors were reading government policy documents.

We’ve been tracking this exact trajectory since the tax credit expiration was first proposed in June 2025. When the $28 billion Battery Belt started collapsing into ghost towns of stalled construction sites and mass layoffs, Toyota’s North Carolina battery plant was opening at full capacity—for hybrids. While GM idled $2 billion in battery facilities and Ford stopped Lightning production with no restart timeline, Toyota announced actual expansion with real jobs making vehicles people actually buy without needing $7,500 in taxpayer subsidies.

The contrast is staggering. Just five days ago, we covered Toyota’s $14 billion North Carolina battery plant opening and its $10 billion five-year commitment. Today’s $912 million is the first concrete allocation from that commitment, and it’s going exactly where market demand exists—hybrid production capacity.

This connects to something Toyota’s chairman said back in October 2023 that seemed controversial at the time: there are many paths up the mountain of carbon neutrality. While American automakers chose the steepest, rockiest path because government subsidies promised to carry them up it, Toyota took the longer but more sustainable route that didn’t require perpetual taxpayer life support.

The real question now is how long Detroit’s Big Three can sustain their EV losses while Toyota expands profitable hybrid production. Ford’s Model E division hemorrhaging $1.4 billion per quarter isn’t sustainable. GM’s 3,400 layoffs and idled plants aren’t a short-term adjustment—they’re a strategic retreat. The American auto industry bet everything on a subsidy-dependent market that evaporated on September 30, 2025, and now they’re paying the price while Toyota quietly builds the vehicles customers actually want.

Dakich, who was involved in the Digital Crossroads data center in Hammond, spoke to the Strategic Energy Growth Task Force during an afternoon meeting at the Indiana State Museum.

The industry is also doing a “bad job” talking about the “de minimus” amount of water needed for cooling the massive facilities, he said.

He blamed opaque processes and bad information for fostering massive backlash among residents — prompting local officials to pull their support and tank projects years into development.

That’s putting some off Indiana, said Dakich, who added, “We’ve got to figure out a way to make those public officials insulated.”

Rep. Ed Soliday, R-Valparaiso, said lawmakers have already attempted.

Legislation to take control over large-scale utility infrastructure projects decisions has failed repeatedly.

“We said, ‘Let us take responsibility, and we’ll set the standards.’ And they didn’t want that. They wanted complete control,” he said.

Soliday, who chairs the Indiana House’s energy committee, said no clapping, booing or signage is allowed during his meetings — and critiqued chaotic local gatherings.

“Why would we not have them build that?” Jaworowski asked. “Because we need that generation in the state and having a third party pay for it, rather than having our ratepayers pay for it, is just a great opportunity.”

The task force also heard from representatives of other big users, like Steel Dynamics, a member of Indiana Industrial Energy Consumers.

Indiana Manufacturers Association also presented, maintaining that its members are “ready to invest, hire and build” — but only with guaranteed access to reliable and affordable power.

Soliday rebuffed energy supply fears throughout the meeting, calling such comments “disingenuous” and himself “really weary of this.”

Some industrial groups praised the proposal, while environmental groups said it would threaten clean water and worsen flood risk.

Kentucky has already lost huge swaths of its wetlands, which are ""among the most productive ecosystems in the world, comparable to rain forests and coral reefs,"" according to the EPA.

The Trump administration is moving to narrow federal definitions of the nation's waters, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced Nov. 17 — a change that would likely exclude many waterways and a vast majority of Kentucky's vital, dwindling wetlands from protections.

The proposed changes come after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against a broader interpretation of the Clean Water Act in 2023, in Sackett v. EPA. Kentucky waterway advocates at the time called the ruling ""calamitous,"" and feared it would presage a broader erosion of environmental protections.

The EPA, under President Donald Trump, is now looking to set a new definition of ""waters of the U.S.,"" known colloquially as WOTUS. These rules are meant to delineate which water bodies receive protections under the Clean Water Act and which do not.

The newly proposed definition would leave tens of millions of acres of U.S. wetlands, and likely most of Kentucky's, without Clean Water Act protections by requiring waters to be ""standing or continuously flowing year-round or at least during the wet season.""

Countless smaller waterways could also be cut out of protections, even if they ultimately drain to larger, protected bodies of water.

The proposed changes were praised by the American Farm Bureau, the National Association of Manufacturers and other industry groups as regulatory relief, and quickly denounced by environmental groups as a threat to clean water and healthy ecosystems.

""When finalized, the rule will cut red tape,"" the EPA said in a statement, ""and provide predictability, consistency, and clarity for American industry, energy producers, the technology sector, farmers, ranchers, developers, businesses, and landowners for permitting under the Clean Water Act.""

Nick Hart, policy director for the Kentucky Waterways Alliance, said the new rules create ""a right to pollute"" for industry to take advantage of, and go further in eroding protections than was needed to comply with the Supreme Court's 2023 decision.

""Based on this rule,"" Hart said, ""it is going to be harder for Kentucky to reach what we would think of as drinkable, swimmable, fishable water.""

Why wetlands matter

Kentucky has more than 320,000 acres of wetlands, according to federal inventories. Under the proposed changes, only about 44,000 acres of those, less than 15%, would meet the standards for Clean Water Act protections, according to an analysis published by the administration.

Kentucky wetlands left without protections under the proposed definitions make up a total acreage larger than the entirety of Jefferson County, based on the federal analysis. By the turn of this century, Kentucky had already lost more than 80% of its historical wetlands, by some estimates.

""Kentucky can't afford to lose many more wetlands,"" Hart said.

Wetlands are crucial for flood control, acting as a sponge during periods of heavy rainfall, and improve water quality by filtering pollutants and trapping sediment. These services save Kentucky millions of dollars annually, according to the state.

More than one-third of threatened and endangered species in the U.S. live exclusively in wetlands, according to the EPA, which extolls wetlands as ""among the most productive ecosystems in the world, comparable to rain forests and coral reefs.""

State and federal agencies, along with The Nature Conservancy and other organizations, have spent considerable resources to protect and restore Kentucky's wetlands, especially in the western half of the state. By curbing protections for these ecosystems, Hart said the EPA is privatizing benefits for developers and other industries, while shifting costs and the burden of environmental harm to the public.

""We're subsidizing entities to go in and fill in wetlands,"" he said, ""and then we use taxpayer dollars or private philanthropy dollars to go and make wetlands in other places to make up for the damage that we have done.""

The new EPA rule ""doesn’t encompass and protect enough of our waters,"" The Nature Conservancy said in a statement, adding, ""permitting efficiencies should not come at the expense of water quality or the many benefits clean water provides.""

Kentucky waterways and communities at risk

In addition to wetlands, countless Kentucky waterways could lose protections under the EPA's narrowed definitions, although it could take time to fully establish the scope of the rules, which are not finalized and will first undergo a public comment process.

For example, ""there are very strong arguments"" that sections of Louisville's beleaguered Beargrass Creek could lose protections under the proposal, according to Hart's interpretation. Many stretches of the creek are funneled through manmade concrete channels, rather than taking the meandering path of a natural waterway.

Ephemeral streams, which only flow during especially wet periods, such as after a heavy rain, may also be cut out of the new definitions. Recent research indicates these streams have an important role in drainage systems and the transport of water and pollutants into larger rivers and water bodies.

The Trump administration's plans to rollback Clean Water Act protections come less than a year after Republicans in the Kentucky General Assembly opted to cede water protection definitions to the federal level. Before the passage of Senate Bill 89 earlier this year, Kentucky maintained its own definition of ""waters of the commonwealth,"" but now mostly defers to the federal definitions, which the EPA is seeking to roll back.

The Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet vocally opposed the bill, arguing it would open up groundwater and other resources to pollution and degradation. Gov. Andy Beshear vetoed the legislation, which he said failed to protect water used by more than 1.5 million Kentuckians and would result in more dangerous flooding. The legislature overrode the veto.

The state has long wrestled with water quality issues, and a 2024 state assessment of thousands of miles of Kentucky's rivers found a majority to be impaired, in addition to dozens of lakes and reservoirs. And failing to protect wetlands or keep new development away from waterways could reap disaster as Kentucky sees more extreme rainfall events and historic floods.

""There are a lot of unknowns already about how this is going to play out,"" Hart said. ""What was nice about the prior rules is that they were based on hydrology, and they were based on science, and they were based on how water operates in the real world, as opposed to creating a fiction about how we want water to operate.""","https://www.courier-journal.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/05/21/PLOU/73786778007-20240422-farmwater-cg-42.jpg?crop=8639,4861,x0,y449&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-18 18:01:21.945203

The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) has announced $7.86 million in funding to Li-S Energy Ltd (Li-S Energy) to support the next phase of Australia’s advanced battery manufacturing capability.

The funding will enable Li-S Energy to undertake manufacturing optimisation, a feasibility study and front-end engineering design (FEED) for a proposed lithium-sulfur battery cell manufacturing facility. The proposed facility aims to produce up to 1 GWh per year of battery cell capacity – 500 times the capacity of Li-S Energy’s current Geelong-based facility.

ARENA CEO Darren Miller said the project reflects Australia’s commitment to building local manufacturing capability and accelerating innovation in energy storage.

Mr Miller said,

By supporting Li-S Energy’s plans to scale up lithium-sulfur battery production, we are helping to fast-track the commercialisation of breakthrough battery technologies.

“Batteries are essential to the clean energy transition, both for energy storage and transport. That’s why it’s critical we keep advancing innovations that improve performance, increase energy density and drive down costs,”

Lithium-sulfur batteries have the potential to deliver up to twice the energy density of conventional lithium-ion batteries, enabling longer range and lighter weight for electric vehicles, drones, wearables and other applications. This aligns with the Australian Government’s energy storage strategy, which prioritises technologies that support renewable integration and reduce reliance on imported battery systems.

Li-S Energy CEO and MD Dr Lee Finniear said the funding is a major step towards commercial readiness.

Dr Finniear said,

This funding enables us to accelerate the critical commercial and engineering studies needed to progress advanced lithium-sulfur batteries toward large-scale production.

”It will help meet growing demand for lightweight batteries in drones, defence, aerospace and other relevant high-value commercial markets,”

As more renewable energy generation enters the grid, the need for energy storage is increasing. This funding reflects ARENA’s strategic priority to reduce the cost and increase the diversity of technologies available to support the deployment of energy storage in Australia.

This funding has been administered under ARENA’s Advancing Renewables Program, which is continuously open for applications that address our investment focus areas and involve a renewable energy technology or technologies that increase the supply of, or improve the competitiveness of, renewable energy in Australia.

This year, the company has made two moves to bring its European waste-to-energy expertise to the U.S. for the first time, with plans to broaden its portfolio.

Ashley Corke is the company’s regional vice president of waste-to-energy in North America. Until September, he served as the general manager for the company’s Eastcroft Energy-from-Waste facility in the United Kingdom. He said the company has learned plenty of lessons from its international facilities that it can apply to the U.S.

“Obviously the business is more mature in Europe compared to the U.S. We’re now just introducing the strategy we’ve had in the rest of the world, in Europe, into the U.S. business,” Corke said.

FCC Group has operated waste-to-energy facilities for about 20 years, and today it has about 13 sites — predominantly in the UK, Spain and Austria, according to Corke. Its North American subsidiary earned its first municipal solid waste collection contract in 2015 in Orange County, Florida. It has since established a presence in seven states, including North Carolina and Texas, with a fleet of roughly 1,200 vehicles.

Corke said the company’s hauling business, which handles waste and recycling for commercial and municipal clients, forms the backbone of its presence. FCC has been intentional about establishing hauling contracts first to feed into the recycling facilities — and now incinerators — it’s looking to build or add to its portfolio.

“Municipalities can get the best value out of a consistent company that can provide all solutions that they may need for waste,” Corke said.

So far, FCC has followed that strategy in two Florida markets. The company acquired in July the South Broward Waste-to-Energy Facility in Fort Lauderdale from Win Waste Innovations. The mass burn combustion facility was built in 1991 and can handle about 824,000 tons of waste annually.

FCC also won a $320.9 million contract in October to operate Pinellas County’s mass burn combustion facility, taking over the contract from Reworld. That facility opened in 1983 and handles about 830,000 to 880,000 tons of waste annually, according to The St. Pete Catalyst.

Corke said FCC’s experience with following strict emissions guidelines in Europe makes the company well equipped to handle pending U.S. regulatory updates and the potential for needed facility upgrades.

The EU last updated its expectations for incinerators in 2019. Those regulations are stricter than U.S. federal rules, which have not been updated for large municipal waste combustors since 2006. But the U.S. EPA circulated a proposal in 2024 with limits more in line with EU rules for pollutants like mercury, nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide.

Given the age of FCC’s Florida facilities, upgrades may be needed. The company has successfully upgraded its European facilities in the past, including one in the U.K. that’s 53 years old, Corke said. He sees no reason the company can’t accomplish the same in the U.S. — as long as it has the support of local governments.

“We’re very aware these are mechanical systems. With the right engineering and the right science, we can make these last 100 years if we need,” he said.

Corke said the company would also look at other regions interested in incineration capacity, including in the Northeast U.S. and in Canada.

TotalEnergies acquires 50% in Czech energy company EPH’s power business

French company aims to grow power business while also increasing oil and gas

Strategy contrasts with Shell and BP that scrapped most renewables plans

LONDON, Nov 18 (Reuters) – France’s TotalEnergies (TTEF.PA) is betting big on power and renewables, positioning itself to ride the global electricity demand wave and offer investors a clear alternative to rivals doubling down on oil and gas.

European oil companies’ strategies have seesawed since 2022, when Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the related sanctions created an energy shock that made governments focus more on near-term energy security than the long-term energy transition.

The changing landscape led Shell (SHEL.L) and BP (BP.L) to ditch plans to plough billions of dollars into renewables and instead refocus on their legacy operations, aligning with U.S. rivals Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and Chevron (CVX.N).

At the same time, TotalEnergies CEO Patrick Pouyanne defied investor pressure and largely stuck to a strategy first outlined in 2020 that strikes a balance between growth in core oil and gas operations and diversification into power and renewables.

That strategy was on full display on Monday when TotalEnergies announced the acquisition of a 50% stake in Czech energy company EPH’s Western European power generation platform in a 5.1 billion euro ($5.92 billion) all-stock transaction.

EPH, majority-owned by Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky, has more than 14 gigawatts of flexible capacity in operation or under construction, including gas-fired and biomass power plants and battery systems in Italy, France, the Netherlands and Britain.

The deal more than doubles TotalEnergies’ gas and biomass generation capacity to 13.5 GW, making it one of the largest producers in Europe.

The company expects the deal to boost cashflow by $750 million per year over the next five years while also reducing annual capital expenditures by $1 billion to between $14 billion and $16 billion, as the French energy major will not need to invest in building new power capacity.

Renewable power generation

POWER PLAY

TotalEnergies aims to generate 100 to 120 terawatt hours of electricity globally by 2030, compared with 41 TWh in 2024, mainly by expanding solar and wind power. That equates to over 4% of the European Union’s annual consumption.

To be sure, TotalEnergies has slowed investments in renewables and power in recent years in the face of soaring oil and gas prices and weakening returns on solar and wind. The company in September said it will cut annual spending on its integrated power business by 20-40% to between $3 billion and $4 billion.

And TotalEnergies’ power business is still far smaller than its core oil and gas businesses, which accounted for around 88% of adjusted net income of $4.7 billion in the third quarter.

But when it comes to growth rates, power takes the prize. While oil and gas production is expected to increase by 3% per year by 2030, TotalEnergies aims to grow its gross installed renewables power generation three-fold from current levels to 100 GW by the end of the decade.

In Europe alone, following the EPH deal, TotalEnergies aims to grow gas and biomass generation by 40% between now and 2030 to 35 TWh and more than triple current renewables and batteries capacity over the same period to 20 GW and 7 GW, respectively.

By comparison, Shell and BP have sold or spun off most of their renewable power generation assets in recent years. Shell had a mere 4 GW of net renewable generation by the end of September, compared with 19 GW for TotalEnergies. Exxon and Chevron have modest plans to invest in gas-fired power generation in the United States.

Italian energy group Eni (ENI.MI), like its French rival, has stuck to its energy transition strategy, though it took a unique path by spinning off its renewables and retail arm into a standalone business to attract external investment. The business, Plenitude, aims to almost triple its renewables generation capacity to 15 GW by 2030.

Oil majors’ share performance

‘IT TAKES TIME’

Investors have so far responded coolly to TotalEnergies’ strategy. Its shares have risen some 14% since 2020, compared with gains of 67% for Exxon, 29% for Chevron and 27% for Shell, while BP’s shares lost 3% over the period.

Pouyanne recently said he aims to increase TotalEnergies’ power business “step by step” in order to keep pace with the expected growth in electricity consumption from electric vehicles and data centres.

“The transition will happen, but it takes time,” Pouyanne told the Energy Intelligence Forum in October.

TotalEnergies has never had the flashiest clean energy strategy – as it has always sought to continue growing its legacy oil and gas business even as it pivots to power and renewables. But that steady realism may be just what the energy transition needs.

Enverus Intelligence Research (EIR), a subsidiary of Enverus, an energy-dedicated software-as-a-service company that leverages generative artificial intelligence (AI) across its solutions, released its latest U.S. power capacity expansion outlook on November 18. The report is based on the group’s proprietary load forecasts, interconnection queue analytics, and technology cost curves.

EIR projects a 57% increase in installed U.S. power capacity by 2050. The group said it expects rapid solar energy growth through 2028, despite a more difficult regulatory environment. EIR said it expects remaining coal-fired generation will be replaced by natural gas, and also nuclear power, with what the group said would be “steady long-term growth led by the ramp-up of the U.S. nuclear industry.” EIR said renewable energy installations are expected to peak in 2028, but will remain competitive into the future, “supported by ongoing demand for power purchase agreements (PPAs) and low costs.”

“Our analysis shows the U.S. grid is entering a transformative period, with solar installations surging in the near term and nuclear power taking a leading role in the decades ahead. The retirement of coal and the rise of new technologies will reshape regional generation mixes and drive innovation in grid reliability and energy sustainability,” said Juan Arteaga, PhD, a principal analyst at EIR.

Key Takeaways

EIR said installed U.S. power capacity is forecast to grow 57% by 2050 (Figure 1 above), with the next quarter-century defined by three eras: rapid solar energy growth (2025–2035), coal replacement (2035–2040), and steady nuclear expansion (2040–2050). The group said it expects U.S. coal-fired power will be fully retired by 2040, even with current federal government policies propping up the sector despite continued poor economics for coal-burning power plants. The researchers said they expect coal-fired capacity will be evenly replaced by natural gas and nuclear power generation.

The group noted that the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), which oversees the power grid in 15 states from the Upper Midwest to the Gulf Coast, will experience more than 25 GW of fuel switching. EIR said wind energy, natural gas, and nuclear power “are the most load-sensitive technologies, with capacity buildout remaining relatively inelastic to changes in demand. Battery storage and gas peaker plants will play a crucial role in grid reliability, while combined-cycle natural gas and nuclear plants provide essential baseload support.”

Analysts Agree With Findings

Energy industry analysts who have spoken with POWER generally agree with EIR’s analysis, based on their own forecasts for U.S. power generation for 2026 and beyond. Jim Dawe, vice president and general manager of Generac, in an email said, “Hybrid systems will go mainstream. Solar, storage, generators, and smart controls will converge into seamless home-energy ecosystems as outages and rising rates make resilience the top priority.”

Rex Liu, vice president of product management for Generic, told POWER: “Installers will become full-stack energy advisors. Solar companies will expand into HVAC, storage, smart home tech, and backup power, evolving from single-product sellers to comprehensive home-energy providers.”

EIR’s findings in part are similar to those in a recent report from Bloomberg NEF (BNEF), which noted in its latest New Energy Outlook that renewable energy resources (and electric vehicles)—despite “points of resistance,” including higher interest rates, volatile costs, and rising trade barriers—”continue to show advantageous and improving economics, which ultimately drive their adoption to unprecedented levels.” The group said generation from renewables globally rises 84% between now and 2030, “and then doubles again by 2050.” The group forecasts that the “share of coal, gas and oil in the [global] power system drops to 25% in 2050, from 58% in 2024,” which “results in a 21% reduction in absolute fossil-fired generation levels. Between now and 2035, some 6.9 TW of solar is constructed globally, alongside 2.6 TW of wind.”

BNEF said coal-fired generation will continue to decline, and noted that “most of the incremental coal capacity and one-third of the gas capacity associated with data-center demand is from existing plants that avoid or delay retirement.” The group said global coal consumption falls 25% over the next decade.

A coalition of more than 60 countries, including the U.S., Canada, Mexico, the UK, Germany, and South Korea, are part of the Powering Past Coal Alliance (PPCA). The group in an announcement Monday at the COP30 climate talks in Belém, Brazil, reaffirmed commitments to phase out coal-fired generation over the next several years.

Kim Sung-hwan, minister of Climate, Energy and Environment for South Korea—which joined the coalition on Monday—said: “By joining the PPCA, we are demonstrating the Republic of Korea’s commitment to accelerating a just and clean energy transition. Through the Alliance, we will kickstart our coal phase-out, as well as help the Alliance advance the coal transition worldwide. The shift from coal to clean power is not only essential for the climate. It will also help both the Republic of Korea, and all other countries increase our energy security, boost the competitiveness of our businesses, and create thousands of jobs in the industries of the future.”",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/3-1024x576.png,N,,2025-11-18 14:00:19.110286

The new Energy Saver North Carolina program is designed to make it more affordable for low- to moderate-income households to install energy- and cost-saving measures such as heat pumps, electrical panels and insulation.

In January, the N. C. Dept. Environmental Quality (DEQ) launched Energy Saver NC, which includes more than $208 million for federally funded rebates.

Energy Saver NC includes two programs: Homeowners Managing Efficiency Savings (HOMES) and Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates (HEAR). As part of HOMES, eligible households can receive up to $16,000 for home efficiency improvements, such as air sealing or energy-efficient HVAC units. The HEAR program covers up to $14,000 for high-efficiency electrical appliances like heat pump water heaters and electric stoves.

“Energy Saver NC will help Columbus County families who need it most save money on utility bills, make their homes healthier and more comfortable, reduce emissions and improve our air quality,” said DEQ Secretary Reid Wilson. “This vital program will help improve the lives of North Carolinians on a daily basis, from efficient new electric appliances to installation of new heating and cooling systems.”

North Carolina is the first state in the nation to fully launch both rebate programs at the same time, and the 12th nationwide to implement a rebate program.

Rebate amounts depend on household income and projects’ modeled energy savings. Initially, Energy Saver NC is focusing on single-family, owner-occupied or rented housing, particularly those in high energy-burdened, disadvantaged regions and in areas with storm impacts.

The program is currently open to 39 counties. Residents from across the state may start their application before the program opens in their county. The program will continue to open to more counties across North Carolina in the future.

Single-family homeowners making less than 80 percent of their area median income (AMI) may be eligible for full rebates. Rebates at lower amounts will be available for moderate-income homeowners earning between 80 percent and 150 percent of their AMI.

Four-person households in Columbus County earning up to $61,100 could be eligible for a full rebate. Single-family homeowners and tenants, with their owners’ permission, may apply.

Once income eligibility is confirmed, households that selected the HOMES program will need to schedule a free home energy assessment. Assessors will help households understand how their homes use energy and provide a list of qualified energy efficiency improvements.

Households must use an Energy Saver NC contractor to complete the work. The program’s partners are registered, licensed and trained. These partnerships are directly creating new business, jobs, and boosting Columbus County’s local economy.

After reviewing quotes, households will approve the projects and their prices with the rebate applied. Contractors will then submit the project to the Energy Saver NC program for approval. Once approved, the contractor will complete the work.

Households may apply online, by email, phone or mail. Energy Saver NC also has a customer care team available Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. at 866.998.8555.

The new name reflects the company’s evolution from the world’s leading solar-tracking manufacturer into a broader platform offering an integrated portfolio of advanced technologies and services for utility-scale solar power plants.

Nextpower now provides a connected ecosystem that spans structural, electrical and digital solutions across the full lifecycle of advanced power plants—from design and construction to operation and maintenance. As part of its expanding technology platform, the company also revealed the development of a new line of large-scale power conversion systems (PCS), with first shipments expected in 2026.

“Our customers are looking for coherent, integrated solutions that install faster, deliver stronger performance, and operate more reliably throughout their lifetime,” said Dan Shugar, Founder and CEO of Nextpower.

“In recent years, we have implemented a consistent strategy to broaden our portfolio and build a comprehensive technology platform that delivers significant benefits across the solar value chain,” he added.

“Our new name reflects this transformation,” Shugar continued. “Nextpower builds on decades of leadership in solar tracking to create a market-leading integrated technology platform that supports the world’s most advanced clean-energy systems. We are now in a global electricity super-cycle, with solar power adding more capacity than any other energy source, at the lowest cost. As we expand into PCS, robotics and artificial intelligence, we are enabling solutions that meet the scale, reliability and complexity requirements of today’s utility-scale solar plants.”

As part of its Capital Markets Day, held today, Nextpower reaffirmed its outlook for fiscal year 2026 and presented its guidance for fiscal year 2027, along with long-term financial targets. These include projected revenues of USD 4.8–5.6 billion for FY2030, with around one-third expected to come from products and services outside the solar-tracking segment.

“Our multi-year financial objectives reflect our confidence in Nextpower’s growth trajectory and the strength of our business model,” noted Chuck Boynton, Chief Financial Officer. “We anticipate sustained revenue growth, stronger cash generation and continued investment in expansion, while maintaining healthy margins and a robust balance sheet through disciplined execution and operational efficiency.”

The rebrand comes at a critical moment for the global energy sector. Electricity demand is accelerating, driven by the rapid rise of AI and data-centre loads, electric transport and building electrification. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), US data centres will consume more electricity than the country’s entire energy-intensive manufacturing sector combined by 2030. At the same time, solar energy has become the world’s lowest-cost and fastest-growing source of new electricity generation.

Governments worldwide are therefore emphasising the importance of local supply chains, an area where Nextpower has invested for more than a decade through domestic manufacturing of steel, electronics and components.

Nextracker also confirmed that it will formally change its corporate name to Nextpower Inc. The company will retain its Nasdaq ticker symbol NXT and continue operating under the same leadership team.

The proposed rule is expected to be published in the Federal Register as early as December for a 45-day public comment period.
The RV Industry Association will keep members updated on the progress of the rule.","On Monday, Nov. 10, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a proposed rule to improve the utility and reduce the regulatory burden of its PFAS reporting regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), according to a News & Insights report from the RV Industry Association (RVIA).

Currently, under the Toxic Substances Control Act’s section 8(a)(7), manufacturers (including importers) are required to report certain PFAS data in any year from 2011 to 2022. The 11-year look-back rule has been criticized for imposing a significant compliance burden on the industry without demonstrating how it advances environmental protection goals.

The RV Industry Association and its members have consistently advocated for common-sense changes to the Toxic Substances Control Act 8(a)(7) look-back reporting rule. This summer, the RV Industry Association participated in multiple in-person meetings with EPA leadership to outline the challenges of collecting chemical composition data on products sourced across a diverse and multi-tiered global supply chain.

The proposed rule includes several exemptions and modifications that would maintain important reporting requirements on PFAS while exempting certain low-value activities impacting the RV industry.

The proposed exemptions include:

Imported articles;

PFAS manufactured (including imported) in mixtures or products at concentrations 0.1% or lower;

Certain byproducts;

Impurities;

Research and development chemicals; and

Non-isolated intermediates.

Under the imported articles exemption, RV Industry Association members and suppliers who import finished products from overseas sources would not be required to collect and report PFAS information on those products to the EPA.

Further, products that contain de minimis levels of PFAS (less than 0.1%) would be excluded from reporting. These two exemptions alone would exempt much of the RV industry’s reporting obligations under the Toxic Substances Control Act, eliminating significant costs and regulatory burden on RV manufacturers and suppliers.

The proposed rule is expected to be published in the Federal Register as early as December for a 45-day public comment period. If finalized, the data submission period will begin 60 days after the rule’s effective date and will be open for a 90-day period. The RV Industry Association will keep members updated on the progress of the rule.

Solutions from labs big and small Global energy leaders offered glimpses of their research projects.
The panel also highlighted the MIT Proto Ventures Program, an initiative to seize early-stage MIT ideas and unleash them as world-changing startups.","“We’re here to talk about really substantive changes, and we want you to be a participant in that,” said Desirée Plata, the School of Engineering Distinguished Professor of Climate and Energy in MIT’s Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, at Energizing@MIT: the MIT Energy Initiative’s (MITEI) Annual Research Conference that was held on Sept. 9-10.

Plata’s words resonated with the 150-plus participants from academia, industry, and government meeting in Cambridge for the conference, whose theme was “tackling emerging energy challenges.” Meeting such challenges and ultimately altering the trajectory of global climate outcomes requires partnerships, speakers agreed.

“We have to be humble and open,” said Giacomo Silvestri, chair of Eniverse Ventures at Eni, in a shared keynote address. “We cannot develop innovation just focusing on ourselves and our competencies … so we need to partner with startups, venture funds, universities like MIT and other public and private institutions.”

Added his Eni colleague, Annalisa Muccioli, head of research and technology, “The energy transition is a race we can win only by combining mature solutions ready to deploy, together with emerging technologies that still require acceleration and risk management.”

Research targets

In a conference that showcased a suite of research priorities MITEI has identified as central to ensuring a low-carbon energy future, participants shared both promising discoveries and strategies for advancing proven technologies in the face of shifting political winds and policy uncertainties.

One panel focused on grid resiliency — a topic that has moved from the periphery to the center of energy discourse as climate-driven disruptions, cyber threats, and the integration of renewables challenge legacy systems. A dramatic case in point: the April 2025 outage in Spain and Portugal that left millions without power for eight to 15 hours.

“I want to emphasize that this failure was about more than the power system,” said MITEI research scientist Pablo Duenas-Martinez. While he pinpointed technical problems with reactive power and voltage control behind the system collapse, Duenas-Martinez also called out a lack of transmission capacity with Central Europe and out-of-date operating procedures, and recommended better preparation and communication among transmission systems and utility operators.

“You can’t plan for every single eventuality, which means we need to broaden the portfolio of extreme events we prepare for,” noted Jennifer Pearce, vice president at energy company Avangrid. “We are making the system smarter, stronger, and more resilient to better protect from a wide range of threats such as storms, flooding, and extreme heat events.” Pearce noted that Avangrid’s commitment to deliver safe, reliable power to its customers necessitates “meticulous emergency planning procedures.”

The resiliency of the electric grid under greatly increased demand is an important motivation behind MITEI’s September 2025 launch of the Data Center Power Forum, which was also announced during the annual research conference. The forum will include research projects, webinars, and other content focused on energy supply and storage, grid design and management, infrastructure, and public and economic policy related to data centers. The forum’s members include MITEI companies that also participate in MIT’s Center for Environmental and Energy Policy Research (CEEPR).

Storage and transportation: Staggering challenges

Meeting climate goals to decarbonize the world by 2050 requires building around 300 terawatt-hours of storage, according to Asegun Henry, a professor in the MIT Department of Mechanical Engineering. “It’s an unbelievably enormous problem people have to wrap their minds around,” he said. Henry has been developing a high-temperature thermal energy storage system he has nicknamed “sun in a box.” His system uses liquid metal and graphite to hold electricity as heat and then convert it back to electricity, enabling storage anywhere from five to 500 hours.

“At the end of the day, storage provides a service, and the type of technology that you need is a function of the service that you value the most,” said Nestor Sepulveda, commercial lead for advanced energy investments and partnerships at Google. “I don't think there is one winner-takes-all type of market here.”

Another panel explored sustainable fuels that could help decarbonize hard-to-electrify sectors like aviation, shipping, and long-haul trucking. Randall Field, MITEI’s director of research, noted that sustainably produced drop-in fuels — fuels that are largely compatible with existing engines — “could eliminate potentially trillions of dollars of cost for fleet replacement and for infrastructure build-out, while also helping us to accelerate the rate of decarbonization of the transportation sectors.""

Erik G. Birkerts is the chief growth officer of LanzaJet, which produces a drop-in, high-energy-density aviation fuel derived from agricultural residue and other waste carbon sources. “The key to driving broad sustainable aviation fuel adoption is solving both the supply-side challenge through more production and the demand-side hurdle by reducing costs,” he said.

“We think a good policy framework [for sustainable fuels] would be something that is technology-neutral, does not exclude any pathways to produce, is based on life cycle accounting practices, and on market mechanisms,” said Veronica L. Robertson, energy products technology portfolio manager at ExxonMobil.

MITEI plans a major expansion of its research on sustainable fuels, announcing a two-year study, “The future of fuels: Pathways to sustainable transportation,” starting in early 2026. According to Field, the study will analyze and assess biofuels and e-fuels.

Solutions from labs big and small

Global energy leaders offered glimpses of their research projects. A panel on carbon capture in power generation featured three takes on the topic: Devin Shaw, commercial director of decarbonization technologies at Shell, described post-combustion carbon capture in power plants using steam for heat recovery; Jan Marsh, a global program lead at Siemens Energy, discussed deploying novel materials to capture carbon dioxide directly from the air; and Jeffrey Goldmeer, senior director of technology strategy at GE Vernova, explained integrating carbon capture into gas-powered turbine systems.

During a panel on vehicle electrification, Brian Storey, vice president of energy and materials at the Toyota Research Institute, provided an overview of Toyota’s portfolio of projects for decarbonization, including solid-state batteries, flexible manufacturing lines, and grid-forming inverters to support EV charging infrastructure.

A session on MITEI seed fund projects revealed promising early-stage research inside MIT’s own labs. A new process for decarbonizing the production of ethylene was presented by Yogesh Surendranath, Donner Professor of Science in the MIT Department of Chemistry. Materials Science and Engineering assistant professor Aristide Gumyusenge also discussed the development of polymers essential for a new kind of sodium-ion battery.

Shepherding bold, new technologies like these from academic labs into the real world cannot succeed without ample support and deft management. A panel on paths to commercialization featured the work of Iwnetim Abate, Chipman Career Development Professor and assistant professor in the MIT Department of Materials Science and Engineering, who has spun out a company, Addis Energy, based on a novel geothermal process for harvesting clean hydrogen and ammonia from subsurface, iron-rich rocks. Among his funders: ARPA-E and MIT’s own The Engine Ventures.

The panel also highlighted the MIT Proto Ventures Program, an initiative to seize early-stage MIT ideas and unleash them as world-changing startups. “A mere 4.2 percent of all the patents that are actually prosecuted in the world are ever commercialized, which seems like a shocking number,” said Andrew Inglis, an entrepreneur working with Proto Ventures to translate geothermal discoveries into businesses. “Can’t we do this better? Let’s do this better!”

Geopolitical hazards

Throughout the conference, participants often voiced concern about the impacts of competition between the United States and China. Kelly Sims Gallagher, dean of the Fletcher School at Tufts University and an expert on China’s energy landscape, delivered the sobering news in her keynote address: “U.S. competitiveness in low-carbon technologies has eroded in nearly every category,” she said. “The Chinese are winning the clean tech race.”

China enjoys a 51 percent share in global wind turbine manufacture and 75 percent in solar modules. It also controls low-carbon supply chains that much of the world depends on. “China is getting so dominant that nobody can carve out a comparative advantage in anything,” said Gallagher. “China is just so big, and the scale is so huge that the Chinese can truly conquer markets and make it very hard for potential competitors to find a way in.”

And for the United States, the problem is “the seesaw of energy policy,” she says. “It’s incredibly difficult for the private sector to plan and to operate, given the lack of predictability and policy here.”

Nevertheless, Gallagher believes the United States still has a chance of at least regaining competitiveness, by setting up a stable, bipartisan energy policy, rebuilding domestic manufacturing and supply chains; providing consistent fiscal incentives; attracting and retaining global talent; and fostering international collaboration.

The conference shone a light on one such collaboration: a China-U.S. joint venture to manufacture lithium iron phosphate batteries for commercial vehicles in the United States. The venture brings together Eve Energy, a Chinese battery technology and manufacturing company; Daimler, a global commercial vehicle manufacturer; PACCAR Inc., a U.S.-based truck manufacturer; and Accelera, the zero-emissions business of Cummins Inc. “Manufacturing batteries in the U.S. makes the supply chain more robust and reduces geopolitical risks,” said Mike Gerty, of PACCAR.

While she acknowledged the obstacles confronting her colleagues in the room, Plata nevertheless concluded her remarks as a panel moderator with some optimism: “I hope you all leave this conference and look back on it in the future, saying I was in the room when they actually solved some of the challenges standing between now and the future that we all wish to manifest.”",https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/images/202510/mitei-annual-conference.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 13:04:03.179410

This sizable investment, the initial stage of a planned $10 billion USD investment by the Japanese marque into its US base before 2030, will also lead to a number of new jobs being created at Toyota, although, bizarrely, not as many of you might think.

$912 Million Investment To Be Split Across Five US Plants

Earlier this month, and after the call was made to “go out and buy a Toyota,” the Japanese marque confirmed that “up to $10 billion” USD would be invested into its US infrastructure over the next four years. This, incidentally, is on top of a new, $13.9 billion battery plant in North Carolina, production of which has now begun. The $912 million total marks the first step in that plan, with the investment set to be spread across five states in southern America.

Of the five, Toyota West Virginia gets the bulk of that expenditure – $453 million – which will be used to increase assembly of four-cylinder hybrid-compatible engines, sixth-generation hybrid transaxles and rear motor stators. Toyota Kentucky is next up, with $204.4 million dedicated to the installation of a new machining line for four-cylinder hybrid powerplants, while Toyota Mississippi ($125 million) will oversee production of the hybrid-electric Corolla, marking the first time an electrified version of the staple model will be assembled in the US.

Toyota Tennessee ($71.4 million) and Toyota Missouri ($57.1 million) will look to increase production of new hybrid transaxle cases/engine blocks and cylinder heads by “nearly 500,000” and “more than 200,000” units, respectively. Most of the above investments are expected to be completed by 2027. This near $1 billion investment is set to create a very specific 252 new jobs, the majority of these, 82, will open in Kentucky, with 80 set to be available in West Virginia.

Why General Motors Should Be Worried

Encouraging as this news is for hybrid Toyota fans in North America, this news will probably lead to a few mopped foreheads in Detroit as well. The Japanese marque, after all, is the second-largest seller of new vehicles in the US behind only General Motors, and, while demand for electric vehicles has dropped significantly – not aided by the US government’s U-turn on EV subsidies and customer rebates – Toyota’s hybrid models continue to sell strongly. Independent research by Motor Intelligence claims that, as of Q3 this year, the Japanese marque leads the US hybrid market with at least a 51% market share. All signs point strongly towards Toyota chipping away at GM’s US monopoly.

Ironically though, despite this massive new investment, and given the fallout from the US government’s unpredictable tariff roll-out, Toyota is planning to take a very conservative approach to its model line-up, with vehicle life-cycles set to be extended from seven to nine years. A Toyota spokesman even confirmed recently to HotCars’ sister publication CarBuzz that the brand’s older platforms are still “working well for us,” a potentially significant cost-saving measure.",https://static0.hotcarsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/toyota-hybrid-2.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-11-18 13:04:39.917590

Human-caused climate change will exacerbate pandemics, as it did for COVID-19, and vector-borne diseases, such as malaria.","Fifteen years ago, my friend and mentor, climate scientist Stephen Schneider, said something that has stuck with me. When it comes to climate change, the “end of the world” and “good for you” are “the two lowest-probability outcomes”.

Extreme heat harms health — what is the human body’s limit?

Steve’s aphorism feels especially prescient today. As the 30th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) plays out in Belém, Brazil, this month, misleading climate messaging in the media espouses both these extremes.

At one end, take the actions of billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates. On 28 October, he astounded climate advocates by publishing a manifesto arguing that the climate crisis is less urgent than other major problems that humanity faces (see go.nature.com/23xed). Jarringly, its publication coincided with the devastating Jamaican landfall of potentially the strongest Atlantic hurricane on record, an event that human-caused warming made more likely to happen.

Gates wasn’t implying that global warming is “good for you”, but his arguments are adjacent to that sentiment: there has already been enough progress on climate, and we should instead prioritize addressing what he feels are more pressing issues, such as poverty and disease.

Despite substantial criticism from me and other climate specialists that this presented a false trade-off between climate action and public health, Gates dug in his heels. “What world do they live in?” he said in an interview with the news outlet Axios, telling reporters that he would “let the temperature go up 0.1 degree to get rid of malaria”.

Climate change is also a health crisis — these 3 graphics explain why

Indeed, what world is Gates living in? The idea that climate action must come at the expense of efforts to address human health is a provable fallacy. In our book Science Under Siege (2025), public-health scientist Peter Hotez at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, and I detail how these challenges are, in fact, inseparable. Human-caused climate change will exacerbate pandemics, as it did for COVID-19, and vector-borne diseases, such as malaria. How Gates or anyone else proposes to “get rid of malaria” in a rapidly warming world is anyone’s guess. This is a strawman argument.

Gates’ pivot has been celebrated by climate-change downplayers and fossil-fuel proponents in politics, including US President Donald Trump, and in segments of the media, including the newspapers The Wall Street Journal and New York Post — even if Gates has disavowed their characterizations of his position.

Meanwhile, those at the opposite ‘end of the world’ extreme are hardly any more helpful. “It may be too late” announced Robert Hunziker, a freelance writer in Los Angeles, California, just one month ago on the news site Counterpunch. Such narratives of doom are often reinforced by media outlets that overstate the dire nature of the impacts that are baked in, with breathless headlines about supposed tipping points that have already been crossed.

LENEXA, KAN. (NOV. 18, 2025) – Today, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has approved the State of Kansas’ request to redesignate the Salina Area from nonattainment to attainment for the 2008 Lead (Pb) National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS).

The Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) worked collaboratively with stakeholders to develop strategies to reduce Pb emissions at an industrial facility and bring the Salina Area into attainment with the 2008 Lead (Pb) standard. Today’s approval, following the work by the State and local businesses, reflects the EPA’s commitment to cooperative federalism, pillar three of the Powering the Great American Comeback initiative.

“This achievement represents years of hard work and dedication by KDHE, including collaborating with a local business, to improve air quality in Salina,” said EPA Region 7 Administrator Jim Macy. “We commend KDHE’s efforts to meet their goals to deliver clean air for the community of Salina.”

“We’re proud to share that Saline County is in attainment with the air quality standard for lead,” said KDHE Deputy Secretary of Environment Kate Gleeson. “This important milestone means that the entire State of Kansas now meets all national air quality standards and reflects the dedication and hard work of our staff.”

To redesignate a nonattainment area to attainment, the Clean Air Act (CAA) requires EPA to determine the State has met all applicable requirements for the NAAQS. EPA’s final rule details how the Salina Area meets the CAA requirements for redesignation, including a maintenance plan ensuring continued compliance through 2035.

For more information on the Salina Area final 2008 Pb redesignation, visit docket number EPA-R07-OAR-2025-0693 at https://www.regulations.gov/.

Adjustable-rate mortgages typically start with lower interest rates than fixed rate mortgages.
With high prices and higher interest rates than a few years ago, many Americans are priced out.","Last week, President Donald Trump caused a media frenzy after he floated the idea that the government should back the creation of a 50-year fixed mortgage.

Many commenters, including some of Trump's own supporters, hated the idea. They complained that it would result in Americans being in debt for their entire adult lives, essentially renting from a bank. They complained that this type of mortgage would explode the amount of interest homeowners would have to pay over the lifetime of their loans. They complained that borrowers would be stuck paying interest-only payments for many years and be prevented from actually paying down their principal and building equity in their homes.

""It will ultimately reward the banks, mortgage lenders, and home builders while people pay far more in interest over time and die before they ever pay off their home,"" posted Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green (R-Ga.). ""In debt forever, in debt for life!""

President Trump ""is creating generational debt,"" said Josh Johnson on The Daily Show. ""They're going to be fighting to get out of grandma's will. Grandkids will be like, 'I barely knew her!'"" (Side note: Josh Johnson is very funny. I'm a fan.)

The uproar over the 50-year mortgage idea reached such a high pitch that apparently the White House was furious with the administration official who pitched President Trump the idea, according to reporting from Politico.

Sure, it won't solve our housing affordability problem. But is a 50-year mortgage really such a crazy idea?

""It's not quite as outlandish as it sounds,"" says John Campbell, an economist at Harvard University.

""Honestly, I kind of think it's a fine idea,"" says Eric Zwick, an economist at The University of Chicago Booth School of Business. ""It's not obviously so different from a 30-year fixed mortgage.""

The 50 vs The 30

First of all, the reality is most homeowners ditch their mortgage well before its end date. Some refinance. Others move.

In America, unlike some other countries, including the UK, you can't take your mortgage with you if you sell your house. So when people sell their house and move, they end their mortgages.

The typical American homeowner spends less than 12 years in their home, according to a Redfin analysis of the U.S. Census data. That's actually high compared to recent history. Back in the early 2000s, Americans typically spent only about seven years in their houses.

"" Most people will not have that 50-year mortgage product for that length of time,"" says Daryl Fairweather, the chief economist of Redfin. ""I think in a world where this product exists, a lot of people might sign up for it initially and then try to refinance later.""

In other words, the 50-year mortgage would not be a 50-year trap. It would basically serve as another option on the menu for homebuyers looking to finance their homes. And, because you have longer to pay off the loan, it comes with the benefit of having somewhat lower monthly payments. Maybe that could help some secure their dream house or reap the benefits of investing in the housing market.

""I think affordability is a concern in the housing market,"" Zwick says. ""And one element is the down payment, but another element is the monthly payment. And a longer duration mortgage is gonna lower the monthly payment.""

And, sure, there are real drawbacks to this sort of financing, including especially a much higher interest bill over the life of the loan and an extended period where homeowners aren't paying down their principal and building equity. But those same issues also arise with the 30-year fixed mortgage, albeit to a lesser degree.

And Americans apparently love the 30-year mortgage. More than 90% of American mortgage holders have one!

The American mortgage market is weird

The fact that so many American homeowners have long-term, fixed rate mortgages, and they're able to basically refinance pretty easily whenever they want, makes the U.S. mortgage market pretty weird compared to most other countries.

We won't get into the complicated history here (we might actually do a Planet Money episode on this history in the future). But, for now, we'll say the 30-year mortgages date back to the Depression era. And they're fundamentally a creature of government intervention. The government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac buy mortgages from private lenders, allowing them to offload (and socialize) the risks associated with lending large sums of money for decades at fixed interest rates.

Without this intervention, the 30-year mortgage would probably not be so ubiquitous. I mean, think about it. Would you want to lend someone hundreds of thousands of dollars for decades and freeze the amount they will pay you for providing them with that money? What if they lose their jobs or die? What if interest rates skyrocket and you can find much more favorable terms for lending out that money? And then, to boot, if interest rates fall, the borrower can just walk away from that loan and get a new mortgage at any time when economic conditions are more favorable to them? I mean, yikes. No thanks.

A long time ago, Planet Money interviewed financial journalist Bethany McLean about 30-year fixed mortgages, and she described them as ""a financial Frankenstein's monster"" from the perspective of lenders.

Without an important role for the government in backing these loans, ""I don't think any rational bank would offer this product,"" says David Berger, an economist at Duke University.

"" You need the public sector to play an important role for really long duration mortgages to be viable in the financial system,"" says Joseph Gyourko, an economist at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business.

It helps explain why this sort of mortgage system is so rare in the world.

The Pros of long-term, fixed-rate mortgages

There are some clear benefits of the weird mortgage system we have in the United States. One is lower monthly payments because homebuyers can pay off their loans over 30 years. Another is homebuyers are given an incredible ability to freeze their housing costs in stone and then refinance when it suits them.

Several of the economists we spoke to had 30-year mortgages themselves, and they had refinanced when rates sank below 3 percent a few years ago. They were very nice people, but I hate them now. (I bought a house more recently and the mortgage rate is close to 7 percent).

Anyways, the ability to freeze rates and then refinance later if the opportunity arises is clearly a huge benefit to homebuyers. It offers predictability on your housing costs. And, especially nice, a fixed-rate mortgage basically shields you from inflation and its accompanying higher interest rates. Everything else may get more expensive, but your housing payment actually falls in real terms when there's inflation!

The Cons of long-term, fixed-rate mortgages

That said, as we already alluded to, both 30-year and hypothetical 50-year mortgages come with costs: they tend to have higher interest rates than adjustable rate mortgages and you have a longer period upfront paying interest and not actually paying down your loan much.

But there's more.

If the housing market gets dicey and prices start plummeting, having a large outstanding loan at a fixed interest rate can create serious problems. Gyourko, the economist at Wharton, says long-term, fixed-rate mortgages increase the probability that you can go underwater on your home, a situation where you owe more on your house than it's worth.

"" The borrower on a really long duration loan — 30 or 50 — does not build equity very quickly at all,"" Gyourko says. "" There's a risk that if there's a severe drop in house prices, you go underwater.""

Going underwater is a nightmare. If you sell, it means the money you get won't cover your debt. It gets much harder to refinance, meaning you're stuck with a higher interest rate than you could otherwise get in a situation where the housing market tanks.

If you have a fixed-interest rate and the housing market tanks, ""your house price goes down and you're kind of stuck,"" says Berger, the economist at Duke. ""No one is gonna lend to you when you're underwater. If you had an adjustable rate, your rate would've just dropped automatically,"" and maybe that would help you make your housing payments and not lose your house.

""And are you more likely or less likely to be laid off if house prices drop a lot? Answer: more likely,"" Gyourko says. ""So you run that risk of those two events coinciding, and then you've lost a huge amount of your personal wealth.""

Depending on the state of the economy, the direction of interest rates, and your financial circumstances, it might not make sense to fix your interest rate. Actually, that may be the case right now. Interest rates spiked in 2022 and 2023 and have already started to come down, and many expect them to go down further, especially if the economy enters a recession.

"" Right now, I think it does make more sense for people to get an adjustable rate mortgage,"" Fairweather, the chief economist at Redfin, says.

Adjustable-rate mortgages typically start with lower interest rates than fixed rate mortgages. Fairweather says you can think about the choice to buy a long-term, fixed-rate mortgage instead of an adjustable rate mortgage as effectively paying extra for insurance against future interest rate hikes. And, just like the standard advice for buying any other kind of insurance, ""you don't really want to get insurance if you can afford to self-insure,"" she says. In other words, if you think you could afford the possibility that interest rates spike in the near future, it probably makes sense to get an adjustable rate mortgage.

"" So if you get the adjustable rate mortgage, what I would advise is to make sure you have some room in your budget left over for when the mortgage rate resets potentially at a higher level so that you're not hit with costs that you aren't able to pay,"" Fairweather says. ""But if you could take that savings and you know, put it in your savings account, then you'll probably end up a-okay with an adjustable rate mortgage and actually save money compared to the fixed rate.""

Fixed-rate mortgages may distort our economy

But there are other, economy-wide issues with having so many mortgage-holders with long-term fixed rates.

One is that the government involvement in the housing market that makes our system of widespread 30-year mortgages possible can occasionally result in big problems for taxpayers, especially if regulators aren't vigilant in preventing shady loan practices. Just see what happened during the global financial crisis back in the late 2000s.

""The worst possible situation is what happened in the global financial crisis when Fannie and Freddie were basically insolvent, were put on the treasury's balance sheet and to this day remain there,"" Gyourko says.

Another problem with America's weird system of ubiquitous fixed-rate mortgages is that it may weaken the Fed's ability to juice the economy or lower inflation when needed (aka conduct monetary policy).

That's because fixed-rate mortgage holders are shielded from interest rate changes. If everyone had an adjustable rate mortgage, the Fed could maybe more easily juice the economy by lowering people's monthly payments, nudging them to spend more in the economy. That said, if interest rates go low enough, it will induce many American homeowners to refinance, lower their payments, and potentially goad them to increase their spending and boost the economy.

In inflationary times though, when the Fed needs to bring down spending in the economy, the Fed's job may be tougher and more distortionary to the economy. If everyone were on adjustable rates, the Fed could just raise rates and, boom, homeowners would probably start spending less and inflation would come down. But most American homeowners are shielded from rate increases, so it's new homebuyers — often younger people — who feel more of the pain. Some argue that's unfair.

Speaking of unfairness, Harvard's John Campbell points out that maximizing your personal wealth in our weird mortgage system relies on considerable financial literacy, and populations that are poorer and less educated tend to be less financially literate. So this system results in greater inequality.

""A lot of people don't know when to refinance and they just don't do it,"" Campbell says. ""And there's some very troubling evidence that, in this country, black and Hispanic borrowers are much slower to refinance than white borrowers."" The result, he says, is they tend to pay higher interest rates.

There's another problem with our system: lock in. This has been talked about in recent years. There are tons of homeowners out there who now have rock-bottom interest rates on their mortgages — like, ahem, many of the very financially literate economists I spoke to — and they're reluctant to move.

Lock-in may be one reason why American home prices have been stubbornly high over the past few years, even as interest rates have spiked. Other countries, where adjustable rate mortgages are more the norm, have seen their housing prices dip a lot more in recent years.

"" I think that their housing markets are more reactive to their overall economies,"" Fairweather says. ""So in other places where there's more adjustable rate mortgages, when interest rates go up, that means that homeowners have a reason to sell because their payments are going up. And if they can't afford them or they don't want to pay them, then they'll put their homes on the market. In our housing market, that doesn't happen. There is this unequal treatment between first time home buyers and existing homeowners. And it really benefits long-term homeowners.""

Even more, economists believe that the lock-in that fixed mortgages create is bad for the economy. Many people may be refusing jobs where they could be more productive because they don't want to move.

The real fix for housing affordability

So, yeah, many of the problems identified with the 50-year mortgage idea are also present with the 30-year mortgage.

The real motivation for this idea is to enable more Americans to buy houses. With high prices and higher interest rates than a few years ago, many Americans are priced out.

The economists we spoke to all stressed that this new financial product will not solve the fundamental problem of housing affordability. To do that, we need to start building a lot more homes. Some even said that by juicing demand with this new financial product and not increasing supply, this proposal could actually make housing prices go higher, contributing to the problem.

""Proposals to help home buyers — whether it's this 50-year mortgage or whether it's Kamala Harris's proposal in her presidential campaign to give money to first time homebuyers — the main beneficiaries are actually the people selling houses,"" Campbell says. ""Because given the supply, if you make it easier for buyers, they're bidding against each other for the same supply. The price is gonna go up. The winner is gonna be the person selling.""

So, yeah, we need to build more homes. But, in that world, maybe a 50-year mortgage would have some benefits for some people. Of course, they will need to know the facts about this financial product and make sure it's the right product for them.",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/64b8ee1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5075x2664+0+359/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F26%2F20%2F493e0faf4250a698c0b0da4101c9%2Fgettyimages-2246614323.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 14:00:23.417485

Many American families are shocked after a major federal program funding rooftop solar was canceled. The cuts come at a time when people are already struggling with high energy bills. Once-promising solar projects are now stranded, leaving homeowners — especially low- and middle-income families — uncertain about their clean energy futures.

What Happened

The “Solar for All” program, originally backed by the U.S. federal government, was canceled, leaving many rooftop solar projects in limbo.

This program had promised up to $7 billion in funding to support more than 7,500 low- and middle-income households installing rooftop solar.

The funding cut has hit families hard. Brandon Praileau, a pastor in Norfolk, Virginia, told Al Jazeera he was “mind blown” by the sudden cancellation, after he had helped explain the program’s benefits in his community.

Alongside that, the government is ending a 30% tax credit for residential rooftop solar starting December.

Why Families Are Worried

Rising Power Bills

In some places like Florida, electricity costs have gone up by as much as 60% since 2019.

One woman in Miami-Dade told volunteers she’s afraid to use air conditioning because her power costs are so high — she doesn’t think she can afford to run it.

Without the solar installations, she and others worry they could be trapped paying expensive electric bills for years.

Projects Left Unfinished

Many solar projects were already underway when the funding was pulled. These mid-installation projects are now stranded, putting homeowners and installers in a difficult spot.

Some community groups and solar nonprofits had lined up installations and support for hundreds of homes, but now must pause or abandon what they had planned.

Fewer Solar Jobs

The end of tax credits and grant programs could put thousands of solar workers out of work. Experts say job losses are likely in the solar installation sector, especially among low-income installers.

With less incentive to build rooftop solar, fewer people may choose to work in the industry — slowing down the clean energy transition.

What the Government Says

The U.S. Department of Energy has already pulled $13 billion of funding from other renewable energy programs. This includes projects to upgrade power grids, produce cleaner cement, and expand battery storage.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright defended the cuts, saying the previous grants were part of a “wasteful Green New Scam agenda.”

Wright said ending the programs is about “returning these funds to the American taxpayer,” and promised to focus on “affordable, reliable, and secure American energy.”

Expert Views

Bernadette Del Chiaro, of the Environmental Working Group, warned that ending these incentives leaves consumers “at the mercy of utilities” and rising energy rates.

Barry Cinnamon, CEO of a San Francisco-based solar installer, called it a “big plunge on the solar coaster” — meaning the rooftop solar industry may suffer dramatically next year.

Ed Murray, president of the California Solar & Storage Association, said expected payback times for solar systems could double, from a few years to as much as 12 years, if the credits disappear.

He also warned that states may fail to hit their climate goals, and that air quality could worsen as a result of fewer solar installations.

What It Means Going Forward

Families who had already planned or started installing solar now feel betrayed. Many are asking whether they can finish installations without the promised financial support.

Without federal incentives, rooftop solar may become a far less attractive option — especially for lower-income households that can’t afford the upfront costs.

The industry fears a broader slowdown. If installers don’t have demand, some companies may reduce hiring, or even close, reducing clean energy jobs and innovation.

From a climate perspective, this move could slow the U.S.’s progress on reducing carbon emissions, especially in residential energy.

Final Thought

The cuts to rooftop solar funding are more than just a budget decision — they are a deeply personal issue for many families. For people counting on solar to reduce their power bills and help the environment, the policy changes feel like a sudden reversal of hope.

For many low- and middle-income Americans, rooftop solar wasn’t just about going green — it was a lifeline. Now, some worry that without support, they may never get off the grid’s cycle of rising costs.

Toyota's manufacturing investments follow consumer behaviour rather than aspirational projections, prioritising market reality over technological idealism.","The strategy behind Toyota's latest manufacturing decision reveals a company responding to market forces. On 18 November 2025, the automaker announced it would deploy $912 million across five American plants, creating 252 jobs whilst expanding capacity for hybrid components and vehicles. The pivot represents a calculated response to a fundamental shift in consumer purchasing patterns quickly reshaping production infrastructure.

Electric Vehicles (EVs) now account for nearly 50% of Toyota's US sales, a threshold the carmaker has reached through methodical portfolio expansion rather than dramatic pivots. Where rivals committed billions to battery electric infrastructure only to confront tepid consumer enthusiasm, Toyota maintained its hybrid focus. The payoff appears in the figures. Third quarter 2025 electrified vehicle sales reached 282,794 units, representing 44.9% of total sales volume, positioning the manufacturer to capitalise on demand patterns competitors failed to anticipate.

As global manufacturing confronts a looming skills crisis, Toyota Motor Manufacturing UK, with help of Rockwell, has created a training model that could reshape how the industry develops its workforce

The investment is distributed unevenly across Toyota's American footprint, reflecting operational priorities rather than political considerations. West Virginia receives the largest allocation at $453 million (£344m), funding expansion of hybrid engine, transaxle and motor stator production at the Buffalo facility. The plant currently produces more than one million powertrain units annually. The new capacity, scheduled to begin production in 2027, will increase assembly of fourth-generation hybrid transaxles alongside hybrid-compatible engines.

Kentucky's Georgetown facility, the manufacturer's largest global production site, secures $204 million (£155m) to install machining capacity for hybrid engines. The investment adds 82 positions to a workforce approaching 10,000, with the new line targeting 2027 startup. The powertrain facility operates at capacity of 700,000 units, positioning it as a critical node in Toyota's North American hybrid supply network.

Mississippi plant to become first US location for electrified Corolla assembly

The Mississippi allocation carries particular strategic significance. Blue Springs receives $125 million (£95m) to add hybrid electric Corolla production, marking the first electrified Corollas assembled domestically. The facility, which has produced conventional Corollas since 2011, employs 2,400 and maintains annual capacity approaching 180,000 units. The hybrid addition provides production flexibility across powertrains, insulating the single-model plant against demand fluctuations.

Casting operations in Tennessee and Missouri receive investments targeting hybrid component production. Jackson's facility secures $71.4 million (£54m) and 33 positions to expand transaxle case, housing and engine block production. Three new lines will increase annual capacity by nearly 500,000 units, with startup phased between 2027 and 2028. Troy's plant receives $57.1 million (£43m) and 57 jobs for cylinder head production lines, adding capacity exceeding 200,000 units annually beginning 2027.

The investments emerge against broader industry turbulence. Battery electric vehicle average transaction prices increased from $55,500 in December 2024 to $59,200 in March 2025, compared with average prices of all new vehicles which decreased from $49,700 to $47,500. The pricing gulf underscores hybrid appeal to cost-conscious buyers seeking electrification benefits without premium outlays.

Toyota's manufacturing commitment extends beyond the current announcement. The carmaker recently inaugurated a $13.9 billion battery plant in Liberty, North Carolina, creating 5,100 positions whilst producing 30 gigawatt-hours of lithium-ion capacity annually. The facility will produce batteries for hybrid, plug-in hybrid and battery electric vehicles, including the Camry, Corolla Cross and RAV4 hybrid variants. The North Carolina plant represents Toyota's first battery facility outside Japan, signalling long-term commitment to American electrified vehicle production.

The manufacturer's cautious approach to full electrification appears vindicated by market dynamics. Hybrid sales increased 36% in the second quarter of 2025, with hybrids accounting for 22% of new light-duty vehicle sales. Consumer enthusiasm for range-flexible electrification contrasts sharply with battery electric adoption rates, which have plateaued despite infrastructure improvements and incentive programmes.

Kevin Voelkel, senior vice president of manufacturing operations at Toyota, positioned the investment within the company's localisation philosophy. ""Customers are embracing Toyota's hybrid vehicles, and our US manufacturing teams are gearing up to meet that growing demand. Toyota's philosophy is to build where we sell, and by adding more American jobs and investing across our US footprint, we continue to stay true to that philosophy"".

Political reception proved predictably enthusiastic. West Virginia Governor Patrick Morrisey described the Buffalo investment as demonstrating confidence in the state's workforce and business climate. ""This investment, which creates 80 new jobs for hard working West Virginians, reflects a strong confidence in our people and in the strength of our economy"". Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear cited decades of successful partnership between the state and manufacturer, whilst Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves highlighted the commitment to the state's manufacturing capability.

The investments arrive as Toyota navigates complex regulatory landscapes. California and five additional states maintain Advanced Clean Cars II mandates requiring 35% zero-emission vehicle thresholds, standards Toyota dealers actively oppose. The manufacturer argues such requirements demand unrealistic battery electric penetration rates, displacing emphasis on its hybrid portfolio. The regulatory tension illuminates divergent paths toward decarbonisation, with Toyota backing incremental progress over transformative leaps.

Competitive dynamics reinforce Toyota's strategic positioning. The manufacturer commands more than half the American hybrid market, insulating it from battery electric volatility whilst generating capital for future electrification investments. The Toyota division sold 537,528 vehicles in the third quarter of 2025, with electrified models comprising 46.9% of total sales. The penetration rate demonstrates mainstream hybrid acceptance without premium pricing barriers.

Manufacturing efficiency underpins Toyota's approach. The OEM currently assembles approximately half the vehicles it sells domestically, with North American facilities producing more than three quarters of US-bound vehicles. The localisation strategy reduces logistics costs whilst insulating operations from tariff uncertainties and supply chain disruptions.

The flexible assembly line: How vehicle production learned to hedge its bets

Market uncertainty has forced manufacturers to abandon fixed production lines. Honda, BMW and Volkswagen are investing billions in systems that can switch between combustion, hybrid and electric vehicles by the hour.

Investment forms part of broader $10bn US manufacturing commitment through 2030

The $912 million commitment forms part of a broader $10 billion American investment pledge spanning five years. Total US investment since Toyota's entry nearly 70 years ago approaches $60 billion, positioning the manufacturer as a significant industrial employer with nearly 48,000 direct employees across 11 facilities. The accumulated capital reflects patient deployment rather than reactive spending, building manufacturing capabilities aligned with demand patterns rather than aspirational forecasts.

Production timelines indicate measured capacity expansion. Most new lines target 2027 startup, with Tennessee operations extending into 2028. The phased approach allows workforce development, equipment commissioning and production system refinement without compression risks. Toyota's manufacturing methodology prioritises stability over velocity, minimising disruption whilst ensuring quality standards.

The hybrid investment strategy carries implications beyond Toyota's operations. As battery electric adoption moderates and consumers demonstrate sustained hybrid enthusiasm, manufacturers face renewed questions about electrification pathways. Toyota's multi-pathway approach, long criticised as insufficiently aggressive, appears increasingly pragmatic. The company avoided overexposure to battery electric segments experiencing demand headwinds whilst building profitable hybrid operations generating capital for future technology investments.

Component manufacturing emphasis within the investment breakdown merits attention. Casting facilities in Tennessee and Missouri receive substantial allocations for transaxle cases, cylinder heads and engine blocks. The focus on upstream capacity signals confidence in sustained hybrid demand through the decade, justifying capital-intensive tooling investments with extended payback periods.

The Mississippi Corolla hybrid addition addresses product portfolio gaps. Domestic electrified Corolla production provides supply chain resilience whilst meeting demand for affordable hybrid options. The model targets mainstream buyers seeking fuel efficiency without luxury pricing, expanding addressable markets beyond premium segments.

Toyota's manufacturing footprint expansion coincides with workforce development initiatives. The Toyota USA Foundation recently launched Driving Possibilities, a $110 million programme supporting pre-kindergarten through secondary education with emphasis on science, technology, engineering and mathematics learning. The long-term programme addresses educational gaps whilst preparing future manufacturing workforces, reflecting recognition that advanced production requires sustained investment in human capital alongside physical infrastructure.

The hybrid production expansion occurs as automotive manufacturing confronts structural transformation. Traditional internal combustion expertise loses relevance as electrification accelerates, yet full battery electric transition timelines remain uncertain. Hybrid systems occupy intermediate technological space, requiring both conventional and electric powertrain knowledge. Toyota's investment in hybrid capacity positions the company to navigate transitional decades without premature obsolescence of manufacturing capabilities.

The industry's largest hybrid production base

Global production dynamics inform American investment decisions. Toyota maintains the industry's largest hybrid manufacturing base, with operations spanning Japan, Europe and North America. American capacity expansion reflects both domestic demand growth and strategic hedging against geopolitical disruption. Localised production insulates the company from tariff fluctuations whilst demonstrating commitment to regional manufacturing employment.

The announcement timing proves notable. Following the North Carolina battery plant inauguration six days earlier, the hybrid investment signals a balanced electrification strategy encompassing both range-flexible hybrids and pure electric platforms. The dual approach acknowledges market uncertainty whilst maintaining optionality across technology pathways.

Investment returns depend on sustained hybrid demand through production timelines extending into 2028. Market dynamics could shift as battery costs decline, charging infrastructure expands and battery electric vehicles achieve price parity with conventional alternatives. Toyota's phased capacity additions provide flexibility to modulate investment velocity based on evolving demand signals.

Smart Factories: From 2025 to 2026 — Advancing People, Process and Technology

In this AMS livestream, our editorial team and industry experts reflect on the year’s most significant developments and discuss what they mean for the future.

The manufacturing commitment underscores a central paradox in automotive electrification. Whilst industry rhetoric emphasises battery electric futures, consumer purchasing patterns reveal preference for incremental technology adoption. Hybrids deliver fuel efficiency improvements and emissions reductions without range anxiety or charging infrastructure dependence, attributes resonating with mainstream buyers. Toyota's manufacturing investments follow consumer behaviour rather than aspirational projections, prioritising market reality over technological idealism.

Component capacity emphasis within the investment portfolio reflects supply chain strategy. Rather than relying on external suppliers for critical hybrid systems, Toyota maintains vertical integration across engines, transaxles and electric motor components. The approach provides quality control whilst retaining technological expertise within the company's manufacturing network.

The five-plant investment demonstrates manufacturing network optimisation. Rather than concentrating capacity in single mega-facilities, Toyota distributes production across geographical footprint, reducing logistics costs whilst maintaining operational flexibility. The distributed model provides resilience against facility-specific disruptions whilst supporting regional employment across multiple states.

As Toyota deploys capital across American hybrid manufacturing, the broader industry confronts questions about electrification velocity and pathway diversity. The Japanese manufacturer's methodical approach, focused on profitable hybrid production whilst developing battery electric capabilities, offers alternatives to rushed transitions risking stranded assets and workforce disruption.",https://image.automotivemanufacturingsolutions.com/2131687.jpg?imageId=2131687&x=0&y=12.5&cropw=100&croph=71.67&panox=0&panoy=12.5&panow=100&panoh=71.67&width=1200&height=683,N,,2025-11-18 12:09:29.814577

Future growth hinges not only on deployment rates, but on how effectively developers, grid operators, and financiers collaborate to balance the risk and reward of projects.
To unlock the next wave of European projects, policy frameworks must evolve.

Authors: Florian Hock, Senior Director, Energy Origination Europe at NORD/LB Pablo Cervo, Structured Finance Associate Director at NORD/LB Brandon Faber, Director at NORD/LB","BESS has quickly evolved from an emerging technology into a cornerstone of the green transition. Deployment is accelerating across Europe and North America as grids integrate more renewables, and recognition of the need for flexibility grows.

At NORD/LB, we’ve witnessed this shift firsthand. In just a few years, BESS has matured from a relatively niche asset class into a mainstream component of the clean energy system, attracting investors, policy frameworks, and a growing pool of lenders. As an example, we have financed over 6 GW of storage in the United States to date, ranking among the top five lenders, and closed eight BESS deals across Europe in 2025 alone.

Despite this progress, deployment remains uneven. Contracting, grid connections, and policy frameworks continue to shape which projects succeed and where. Future growth hinges not only on deployment rates, but on how effectively developers, grid operators, and financiers collaborate to balance the risk and reward of projects.

Diverging journeys across the pond

The US market has matured faster than Europe’s, thanks largely to clarity around revenue models and strong state-level incentives. In California and Texas, for example, batteries have become critical to grid stability, helping balance the peaks and troughs of renewable electricity generation. More recently, states such as Massachusetts and New York have joined the expansion by introducing targeted incentive programmes designed specifically for BESS assets.

Policy consistency, combined with falling lithium prices and tax credits introduced by the Inflation Reduction Act, means BESS has become mainstream infrastructure in many areas.

Progress in Europe has taken longer. Early projects encountered long lead times and faced uncertain offtake structures. Before closing its first European BESS deal, NORD/LB spent several years deliberately building market knowledge and relationships — a foundation that has positioned us to capitalise as the landscape matures. New models have recently emerged to address the question of revenue certainty, providing examples that can be replicated across other European markets.

The UK has led with the introduction of floor agreements, which guarantee a minimum income level to the asset owner and provide partial protection against market volatility. Meanwhile, our financing of Germany’s first tolling agreement deal, Project Stendal, helped set a precedent for how such structures can attract long-term debt in Europe.

From bottlenecks to bankability

Despite growing sophistication in contracting, deployment across Europe remains stunted by regulatory bottlenecks, particularly grid connection delays. Closer collaboration between lenders, developers, and floor/tolling providers is critical. Unlike renewable energy projects, where power purchase agreements are standardised, each BESS contract differs. The more tolling providers, banks, and developers build common frameworks, the faster BESS can scale. Successful BESS financing relies on balancing revenue certainty for lenders (ensuring bankability) and upside for sponsors.

Lessons from the US and opportunities for Europe

The US market offers valuable insights into the opportunities that project hybridisation provides. Solar-plus-storage projects are increasingly common and often operate under long-term tolling agreements with grid operators. These models are highly bankable — providing fixed lease payments, requiring only basic performance guarantees, and eliminating a large amount of operational risk for developers.

Europe is beginning to follow similar pathways for hybridisation and long-duration storage. Countries such as Romania – still early in their renewables journey – are embedding storage from the outset, showing that newer markets are learning from those that didn’t roll out batteries in conjunction with their renewable projects. In markets with very high renewable penetration, like Spain, managing load shifts has become a daily challenge. These systems urgently need flexible assets like batteries to stabilise supply and balance the grid.

To unlock the next wave of European projects, policy frameworks must evolve. Long-term capacity markets could provide stable revenue, while pan-European ancillary service markets would increase liquidity and efficiency.

Grid fees also play a crucial role. In some countries they account for a large portion of operating costs, while in others they are completely waived. Developers need clarity and consistency on when batteries are rewarded for supporting flexibility and when they will be charged for using the grid. The US market shows when policy is correctly administered, BESS is deployed efficiently.

Looking ahead: scale, duration and innovation

As equipment costs fall and regulation matures, the question is no longer whether to deploy storage, but how to do so efficiently and at scale. Developers will need to match storage duration to varying market conditions and build in flexibility so systems can evolve as technology improves.

Technological innovation will continue reshaping the sector. We expect new chemistries beyond lithium, such as zinc-bromine, to become commercially viable within five years, opening new possibilities for lenders and developers.

Battery storage is undoubtedly entering a rapid phase of expansion. As Europe’s renewable capacity grows, flexible systems are essential to stabilise the grid and protect consumers. Policy clarity, strong contracting, and effective grid planning can unlock the next wave of investment. At NORD/LB we remain committed to leveraging our market experience to turn technological progress into bankable financial structures that make the energy transition investable.

Uruguay has become a focal point of South America’s EV boom, from a bevy of China’s BYD models crisscrossing the capital, Montevideo, to dozens of Teslas cruising along the famed coastline of Punta del Este where the region’s rich and famous mingle every summer.

Battery-powered electric vehicles made up about a quarter of all new car and SUV sales through October this year, more than doubling their market share from a year ago, according to data compiled by the country’s auto trade group Acau. That’s well ahead of the single-digit adoption rates observed in many other South American markets such as Colombia, Chile and even Brazil, where BYD assembles its cars.

Known for its posh beaches and predictable politics, Uruguay exempts EVs from a 23% import duty and a double-digit excise tax on passenger vehicles. Gasoline costing about $7.40 per gallon and a growing network of charging stations nationwide have also aided EV adoption in this country of 3.5 million people wedged between Brazil and Argentina.

It’s a big change in a region where US, European and Japanese brands - such as Ford, Fiat and Toyota - have manufactured for decades and defined the streetscape. They still make up a much greater overall market share, but EV competition from China in particular is growing rapidly.

Uruguay’s use of tax incentives to boost adoption could serve as a template for other small countries that don’t have ambitions to build a domestic EV manufacturing industry, Bloomberg NEF head of Latin America research Rafael Rabioglio said.

Bloomberg NEF forecasts battery electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles will top 8% of new passenger auto sales in Latin America at more than 400,000 units this year, up from about 2% in 2023. The arrival of affordable Chinese models in a region of price sensitive consumers was a “game changer” for EV adoption, Rabioglio said.

“If it wasn’t for the Chinese, I’m not sure we would have seen this transition happening recently in Latin America,” Rabioglio said.

Chinese brands like BYD, JAC and Omoda accounted for about 90% of the approximately 11,000 battery electric cars and SUVs sold in Uruguay this year. BYD’s popular Seagull model, at just under $20,000, is similarly priced to four-door hatchbacks with gas-powered engines.

Maria Clara Sole, 36, drives as much as 60 kilometers a day commuting to work in the capital Montevideo and shuttling her children around in the BYD Yuan Pro she and her husband purchased for about $31,000 last year after consulting with other BYD owners in their community. Sole estimates she saves up to $400 per month by charging her SUV at home versus filling the tank of a conventional car at a gas station.

Sole and her husband also own an SUV with a gasoline motor, which they use among other things for longer road trips.

“We aren’t ready to go fully electric with both cars. There’s still some uncertainty - especially if I want to drive to Argentina or Brazil. That possibility is limited if it’s not a gasoline-powered car,” she said.

Uruguay’s wealthier enclaves are also home to Tesla enthusiasts even though Elon Musk’s iconic EV maker doesn’t have an official presence in a country that is home to the billionaire founders of some of Latin America’s biggest tech companies.

Car dealers have sold 152 Teslas since 2020, according to trade group Ascoma. That’s small on a global level but towering over Argentina with more than 10 times the population: Tesla doesn’t even factor into the top 40 brands ranked by car sales there, according to Argentina auto industry group Acara.

One dealership, AutoImport near Punta del Este, has sold about 40 Teslas this year and expects to sell at least 60 next year even as premium Chinese brands compete for customers willing to pay $60,000 for a Model 3, operations manager Ramiro Duer said.

“We continue to bet on Tesla because the brand and vehicles continue to surprise day after day with their software updates and occasional vehicle restyling,” he said.

Dozens of Teslas are also thought to have been imported by private individuals or entered the country under rules that allow Uruguayans who return home after living at least two years abroad to bring a vehicle with them duty free.

That’s how mechanical engineer and entrepreneur Martin Canabal brought the Tesla he purchased in 2019 to Uruguay after living almost seven years in San Francisco. Canabal and his wife took their Model 3 on an epic road trip from Alaska to the southern tip of Argentina and finally to their new home in Punta del Este in early 2023.

Canabal, 48, now belongs to an informal club of local Tesla owners that exchange tips on maintenance and upkeep over social media. Several repair shops import spare parts and employ mechanics trained to fix Tesla cars, he said.

Nicolas Jodal, who sold the software company he co-founded to Latin American tech giant Globant three years ago, purchased his second Model X from a local car importer in 2023.

Tesla’s software and autopilot are still a cut above the competition including the BYD vehicles in his household, Jodal said. The 65-year-old software engineer said he would consider buying another EV brand if it offers superior features and performance.

“They are extremely cheap to operate. I don’t think I manage to spend 500 pesos ($12) a month” on electricity, said Jodal. He sees internal combustion engine as “an outdated technology that has no future, at least for passenger transport vehicles.”","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/18/PDTN/87335671007-uruguayelectricbg-tif-56-q-33-r-5-allnioq-2-lmd-7-w-5-km.jpg?crop=2748,1546,x418,y554&width=2748&height=1546&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-18 12:08:36.443654

WASHINGTON, Nov. 17, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The Hamm Institute for American Energy's American Energy + AI Initiative, along with the National Center of Energy Analytics and the CGCN Group's American Energy + AI Coalition, today announced the outcomes of the American Energy + AI DC Summit.

The working session brought together U.S. cabinet officials, senior industry executives, investors and policy experts to examine how the United States can add enough firm power, on near-term timelines, to meet rapidly rising AI-driven demand. The event was held at GE Vernova's Washington, D.C. office.

U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and U.S. Deputy Secretary of the Interior Kate MacGregor provided a briefing on current efforts and remaining gaps.

They participated in the discussion as part of the administration's focus on modernizing federal tools at the Department of Energy and Department of the Interior to support increased power production, transmission buildout, and smarter use of federal lands and emergency authorities.

Through its American Energy + AI Initiative, the Hamm Institute has spent the past year commissioning new research on how to power AI with firm energy, translating that work into policy-ready insights, and hosting working sessions from Oklahoma City to Palo Alto to bring industry, policymakers and investors into alignment around near-term solutions.

""America's ability to lead in AI will depend on whether we can build enough firm power, fast. The Hamm Institute's American Energy + AI Initiative exists to turn convenings like the Summit into steel in the ground, projects underway, and a clear research-backed roadmap that industry and policymakers can use,"" said Ann Bluntzer Pullin, PhD, executive director of the Hamm Institute for American Energy.

As the non-political partner, the Hamm Institute is leading the convening. In contrast, the American Energy + AI Coalition, led by CGCN, is focused on the policy, legislative and regulatory roadmap required to translate those findings.

""This was yet another productive session by the leaders of the Hamm Institute. Through extensive outreach and dialogue, they are developing concrete, meaningful policy reforms to help advance the power and AI goals shared by the electricity and technology sectors, as well as the Trump administration,"" said Mike Catanzaro, CEO of CGCN Group and executive director of the American Energy + AI Coalition. ""Many thanks to Secretary Wright and Deputy Secretary MacGregor for their participation today and their effective leadership on this critically important issue for the nation.""

The Hamm Institute for American Energy commissioned a new study from Mark P. Mills, executive director of the National Center for Energy Analytics and distinguished fellow at the Hamm Institute, titled The Rise of AI: A Reality Check on Energy and Economic Impacts. The report analyzes how surging AI deployment is reshaping U.S. electricity demand and the broader economy and outlines the scale of new firm power required for America to stay competitive. Mills, who testified on AI and data centers before the House Subcommittee on Economic Growth, Energy Policy, and Regulatory Affairs in April 2025, shared key implications for policymakers during the Summit.

""Forecasters, pundits, and policymakers have all been surprised, even shocked, by the magnitude and speed of electricity demand emerging to power AI and the hundreds of billions of dollars of data centers under construction and planned,"" said Mills. ""The economic and strategic importance of the AI race sidelines the idea of an energy transition and highlights the old 'all-of-the-above' approach, especially the immediate needs for more natural gas.""

The Rise of AI is the first paper in a series of reports and forecasts to be produced between the two organizations.

GE Vernova hosted the Summit as part of its work to support customers across power generation, grid, and nuclear as they respond to surging demand from AI, data centers, and advanced manufacturing.

""AI has tremendous opportunity to drive economic growth, and it all starts with energy,"" said GE Vernova CEO Scott Strazik. ""Behind every data center is critical demand for reliable and affordable power. The countries that build resilient, modern energy systems will define the next wave of global competitiveness. We are excited about the opportunity to help our customers and appreciate the Hamm Institute leading this work with research and convenings along with the partnership of Secretaries Burgum and Wright as the Administration works to develop smart energy and innovation policies to shape the future.""

World leaders have gathered in Brazil for the U.N. Climate Conference. The U.S. is not there, but China is. When it comes to energy transition, the U.S. and China couldn't be on more different paths. China is moving away from fossil fuels while the U.S. is doubling down. Experts say this will have consequences for the climate and these countries' economies. NPR sent two correspondents to opposite sides of the Pacific to learn more. We begin with NPR's Julia Simon in Eureka, California.

JULIA SIMON, BYLINE: In far northern California, Chris Mikkelsen drives an old police cruiser past little wooden houses.

Pine trees with moss just, like, hanging off of them.

CHRIS MIKKELSEN: It's just an old seaside town.

SIMON: Mikkelsen is the executive director of the Humboldt Bay Harbor District, which plans to assemble wind turbines for a massive new offshore wind project. About 20 miles off this misty coast, two companies - American Vineyard Offshore and German RWE - plan to build turbines to power more than 2 million homes. Mikkelsen says the project aims to make about 270 long-term local jobs.

MIKKELSEN: It's going to, you know, change the economic viability of our community. And I get a little - my voice gets a little shaky 'cause it's going to make a better opportunity for our kids.

SIMON: Yeah.

MIKKELSEN: That's pretty important.

SIMON: The new terminal was supposed to be shovel-ready as soon as 2026, Mikkelsen says. That's no longer realistic, in part because the Trump administration recently canceled more than $426 million in federal grants for the project. Mikkelsen says it's been pencils down since then as they try to find new sources of money. This is one of dozens of actions this administration has taken to starve the renewable energy industry of federal support from canceling tax credits years early to issuing stop-work orders.

Amanda Levin at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council says the U.S. renewable industry had been growing.

AMANDA LEVIN: For the first time last year, wind and solar produced more electricity than coal. Things were headed in the right direction, but this really just takes the wind out of their sails.

SIMON: The Trump administration is reversing support for renewables, which it incorrectly labels as risky and unreliable. But across the Pacific Ocean, America's biggest competitor - China - thinks otherwise. Let's throw the mic 5,000 miles to NPR's Anthony Kuhn, who's there.

ANTHONY KUHN, BYLINE: You are right, Julia. Here in China, renewable isn't a dirty word. China's leadership has made strategic choices to include renewables in its energy mix. We're in China's Zhangbei region, which is in between the capital Beijing and the edge of the Mongolian Plateau. The area is rich in wind resources, and it's where a lot of China's wind and solar capacity is being installed.

(SOUNDBITE OF TURBINE BLADES SPINNING)

KUHN: Turbine blades swoosh past in huge circles. The electricity goes from here to a grid outside Beijing and on to the rest of China. China now dominates the global renewable sector. In the first half of this year, China built more solar than the rest of the world combined. Seventy-four percent of all large-scale wind and solar projects are being built in China. Compare that to the U.S. that's building 6%. China now has more installed generation capacity from solar and wind than from gas and coal.

It wasn't always this way. Until recently, China's economic growth came at the cost of air pollution from burning fossil fuels. But in the last few decades, authorities in Beijing began to consider a sustainable economic growth model, and renewables have been a key part of that, according to Qin Haiyan, director of the parent company of the wind farm we visited and vice president of the World Wind Energy Association.

QIN HAIYAN: (Through interpreter) Developing the economy and reducing carbon emissions to address climate change are now no longer contradictory.

KUHN: And this, according to the Asia Society's Li Shuo, is the biggest difference between the U.S. and China in climate policy today.

LI SHUO: It couldn't be a stronger contrast between the two countries.

KUHN: In China, solar and wind are now cheaper than coal and gas. Li Shuo says one of the most dramatic aspects of China's climate story is not just that they seem to be cutting their climate emissions...

LI: But also, to what extent other parts of the world can also benefit from China's low-carbon products.

SIMON: So China is now exporting turbines and solar panels and batteries around the world, from Brazil to Nigeria to Pakistan.

KUHN: That's right, Julia. All the renewables growth, both local and exports, is a bright spot amid China's slowing economy, especially its slumping real estate sector. David Fishman is a principal at the Lantau Group in Shanghai.

DAVID FISHMAN: People who used to be swinging hammers building commercial real estate are now swinging hammers installing solar panels. And that - well, yes, of course. You double - triple down on that.

(SOUNDBITE OF WIND BLOWING)

SIMON: Back in Eureka, Mikkelsen walks along a creaky dock, an abandoned pulp mill looming behind us. He says he doesn't understand why the Trump administration would cancel the grants for the terminal supporting the wind project. He says this community has been suffering since 2008 when the pulp mill closed.

MIKKELSEN: Our administration that was recently elected, not only at the presidential level but even some of our Congress and senators, really ran on a platform that we're going to build back America, that we're going to create jobs in rural America - good, skilled, trained, you know, high-paying jobs. And there's no better place. You're looking around, you're seeing the remnants of what once was.

SIMON: It is still unclear what the nationwide cuts to renewable energy mean for U.S. climate emissions.

KUHN: But in China, the climate story is more clear, and it's a rare, encouraging indicator in the global warming story. The growth of renewable energy means that China's emissions seem to be on track to peak or are nearing their peak, Li Shuo says. And China's renewable exports mean the country is helping other countries reduce their emissions too.

SIMON: Jeremy Wallace, professor at Johns Hopkins University, says now, at the end of the day...

JEREMY WALLACE: What America does is part of a story, and it is not the main part of the story. It's a cute side character.

KUHN: China, he says, is now the main character in the story of fighting climate change. Anthony Kuhn, NPR News, Zhangbei County, Hebei Province, China.

SIMON: Julia Simon, NPR News, Eureka, California.

,EVs,2025-11-18 16:06:46+00:00,Factor This™,EIA: Fewer U.S. solar projects reporting delays as developers adjust schedules,Kevin Clark,,,,,https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/solar/eia-fewer-u-s-solar-projects-reporting-delays-as-developers-adjust-schedules/,"Fewer U.S. solar projects are pushing back their expected online dates, according to third-quarter 2025 data from the the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s Preliminary Monthly Electric Generator Inventory.
About 20 percent of planned solar capacity reported a delay, down from 25 percent in the same period in 2024.
Developers brought 31 gigawatts of solar capacity online, increasing the nation’s utility-scale total by 34 percent, EIA reported.
In EIA’s latest monthly inventory, developers plan to bring 32 GW of solar capacity online from October 2025 through September 2026.
The law includes a provision that allows wind and solar projects to keep their eligibility if they begin construction before July 4 of next year.","Fewer U.S. solar projects are pushing back their expected online dates, according to third-quarter 2025 data from the the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s Preliminary Monthly Electric Generator Inventory. About 20 percent of planned solar capacity reported a delay, down from 25 percent in the same period in 2024.

Solar remains the country’s fastest-growing source of new generating capacity, largely from utility-scale photovoltaic projects developed by electric utilities and independent power producers. Although delays remain common, they have been trending lower, and most are short.

Even with elevated delays in 2024, the year set a record for utility-scale solar additions. Developers brought 31 gigawatts of solar capacity online, increasing the nation’s utility-scale total by 34 percent, EIA reported. Cancellations continue to be rare, with less than 1 percent of planned capacity typically withdrawn in any given month.

Project developers initially report planned online dates in the Annual Electric Generator Report. Beginning 12 months before those dates, they provide monthly updates on project status and schedule. Because many developers cannot predict the timing or length of delays, total annual additions often fall short of early-year expectations. In January 2024, developers anticipated more than 36 GW of additions, about 5 GW more than the final total.

Most reported delays occur in late construction or testing stages, often only one to two months before a project is ready to start operation. These short setbacks account for much of the slippage in reported timelines.

In EIA’s latest monthly inventory, developers plan to bring 32 GW of solar capacity online from October 2025 through September 2026. About 5 GW of that total comes from projects that have already pushed back their expected startup dates.

Developers are reportedly moving quickly to start new solar projects after the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) shortened the window to qualify for Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credits. The law includes a provision that allows wind and solar projects to keep their eligibility if they begin construction before July 4 of next year.",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Copy-of-Untitled-23-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 12:05:28.286887

Greenpeace International, were it to defy such an order, might face a contempt ruling by a North Dakota court.
But if Greenpeace International has no presence in North Dakota, it could be difficult for the court to collect, he said.
According to Greenpeace, the judge cut Greenpeace USA’s share to some $280 million, with Greenpeace International, based in Amsterdam and also named in the suit, owing about $65 million.
Greenpeace International said its only connection to the protests was signing a letter calling on financiers to withhold support for the pipeline.","The yearslong court battle over a controversial pipeline — a fight so aggressive, it’s threatening to bankrupt Greenpeace USA — has taken a strange legal twist.

Energy Transfer, the company that won a nearly $670 million judgment against Greenpeace earlier this year over protests against its Dakota Access Pipeline, is mounting a full-court press with its latest strategy. The pipeline company and its allies are exhorting North Dakota’s Supreme Court to block a countersuit from an international branch of Greenpeace in the Netherlands.

In other words, Energy Transfer is asking judges in North Dakota to stop a lawsuit filed under the laws of a different country. The details of its efforts at the state’s Supreme Court haven’t been previously reported.

The strategy is unusual, but not unheard-of.

George A. Bermann, a professor at Columbia Law School and expert on transnational litigation, said that courts generally issue international injunctions like this only sparingly because they are seen as interfering with foreign courts.

If the North Dakota court did issue one, enforcing it would be another matter, he said, because of the messy questions about jurisdiction.

Greenpeace International, were it to defy such an order, might face a contempt ruling by a North Dakota court. But if Greenpeace International has no presence in North Dakota, it could be difficult for the court to collect, he said.

“What Greenpeace would have to worry about is whether any jurisdiction in which it has assets would be willing to enforce that order,” Professor Bermann said.

Earlier this year, a jury in Mandan, N.D., ordered Greenpeace entities to pay nearly $670 million to Energy Transfer after a three-week trial over allegations of trespassing, defamation and conspiracy. Greenpeace maintained that it had played only a supporting role in peaceful protests.

Last month, Judge James Gion, who oversaw the trial, reduced the award by nearly half, citing legal technicalities. According to Greenpeace, the judge cut Greenpeace USA’s share to some $280 million, with Greenpeace International, based in Amsterdam and also named in the suit, owing about $65 million.

Energy Transfer’s new legal strategy is focused on a separate and novel countersuit, filed against it in the Netherlands. There, Greenpeace International is suing Energy Transfer based on a new European Union directive aimed at reining in what are known as SLAPP lawsuits, or those aimed at stifling free speech. (SLAPP stands for Strategic Litigation Against Public Participation.)

Many U.S. states also have laws against SLAPP suits, but not North Dakota.

In a brief in the Dutch court, Greenpeace International said the powerful and politically connected company had brought the case, and an earlier lawsuit in federal court, precisely to bury its critics in costly litigation. Energy Transfer is led by Kelcy Warren, a Trump donor and billionaire who has spoken bluntly about the case.

The filing referenced comments that Mr. Warren made in a 2017 television interview in which he accused environmentalists of torching equipment and causing millions of dollars in damage. “Everybody’s afraid of these environmental groups and the fear that it may look wrong if you fight back with these people, but what they did to us is wrong, and they’re going to pay for it,” he said.

Vicki Granado, a spokeswoman for Energy Transfer, said the company was “pleased that Greenpeace has been held accountable for its actions and that a jury recognized these were not law-abiding, peaceful protests as Greenpeace tries to claim.” She declined to comment further on the appeal.

Greenpeace International said its only connection to the protests was signing a letter calling on financiers to withhold support for the pipeline. It asked the court to block efforts to enforce the verdict and to force Energy Transfer to pay the expenses it had accrued over years of litigation.

Ashkhen Kazaryan, a senior legal fellow at The Future of Free Speech, a think tank at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, said that the European Union directive takes a different approach than U.S. states with anti-SLAPP laws. In those states, the laws allow judges to dismiss cases early in the legal process if they are deemed to be abusive and involve an imbalance of power between the parties.

But the E.U.’s directive allows parties to sue in European courts for damages caused by litigation. If the Dutch court ruled in Greenpeace’s favor, financial penalties could hypothetically be extracted from Energy Transfer assets in Europe, Ms. Kazaryan said.

Greenpeace International’s lawsuit is “an affront to North Dakota’s sovereignty,” lawyers for the company wrote in a petition filed in September.

In recent days, a host of business groups have filed amicus briefs in support of Energy Transfer’s petition. Among them was the American Energy Association, whose members include Liberty Energy, the fracking company founded by Energy Secretary Chris Wright. Its brief called the suit “a clearly vexatious collateral attack filed for the express purpose of evading domestic liability.”

Daniel Simons, senior legal counsel for strategic defense for Greenpeace International, said the framing of the Dutch lawsuit as an attack on North Dakota’s courts was “mere propaganda.”

The solicitor general of North Dakota, Philip Axt, submitted a brief that did not explicitly support either side, but argued that a state court does have the power to issue international injunctions against lawsuits filed abroad. Mr. Axt pointed to decisions in other federal appellate courts that differed from the Eighth Circuit’s approach.

Heated protests against construction of the pipeline in 2016 and 2017 attracted thousands of supporters from around the world. The pipeline runs close to the border of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe’s reservation, and under Lake Oahe, which supplies its drinking water.

The tribe has tried for years to shut down the pipeline in court. In March, Chief Judge James E. Boasberg of the U.S. District Court in Washington dismissed the tribe’s most recent lawsuit, which was filed against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers last year.

This month the tribe reopened its fight, asking the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to reverse that ruling. It said the pipeline is operating without a crucial easement and without a final environmental impact statement, in violation of federal laws.

“We will not allow our water, sacred sites, or future generations be compromised,” said Steve Sitting Bear, the chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe.

The pipeline, which carries crude oil from North Dakota to Illinois, is a threat to Native sovereignty and encroaches on lands that the tribe never gave up rights to, the tribe said. The appeal, filed Nov. 5, focused on the risk of oil spills and what it said was a lack of adequate planning for such dangers. The Army Corps of Engineers did not respond to a request for comment.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/14/multimedia/00cli-greenpeace-01-ptzb/00cli-greenpeace-01-ptzb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 12:09:55.790640

With new state investments and proposed legislation, the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) is making it easier for communities across the state to invest in brownfield redevelopment projects that will create jobs, attract investment and protect our natural resources.

EGLE’s fiscal year 2026 budget includes $77.6 million for the Renew Michigan program, which supports brownfield redevelopment, site remediation, solid waste management and sustainability projects statewide. These investments are helping communities reimagine former industrial and commercial sites as thriving centers of activity and economic vitality.

“Brownfield redevelopment is about more than cleaning up contaminated land, it’s about giving communities the tools they need to grow stronger and more resilient,” said EGLE Director Phil Roos. “These projects create jobs, attract private investment, and make our cities safer and more sustainable for generations to come. With support from the Whitmer Administration and our partners in the Legislature, EGLE is proud to help communities transform environmental challenges into economic opportunities.”

To make brownfield funding even more accessible, Rep. Alabas Farhat (D–Dearborn) has introduced House Bills 5286 and 5287, which would double the cap on brownfield grant and loan awards from $1 million to $2 million per project—recognizing that the cost of redeveloping contaminated sites has increased significantly in recent years. The bill would also remove the limit of one project per community per year, making funding more accessible for both large urban areas and smaller communities.

“Protecting our environment while creating high paying jobs is smart economic development,” said Rep. Farhat. “By raising the cap on projects and expanding the possibilities of the brownfield redevelopment fund, this legislation makes it easier to clean up contaminated sights and attracts new investment. I am glad to have partnered with EGLE on the expansion of this program and am excited for the opportunities this will provide for our local communities.”

Since 2019, EGLE’s Brownfield Redevelopment Program has provided $184 million in incentives supporting 474 projects in more than 50 communities. These projects have leveraged $8.3 billion in private investment and created over 20,000 jobs, transforming long-abandoned sites into valuable assets that strengthen local economies and improve quality of life.

EGLE Director Phil Roos joined Rep. Alabas Farhat, Dearborn Mayor Abdullah Hammoud and local leaders in Dearborn for a tour and roundtable discussion highlighting how state investments in brownfield redevelopment are driving local impact. The City of Dearborn led a tour of Midtown Luxury Townhomes, an example of the type of housing made possible through brownfield redevelopment. Following the tour, Roos, Rep. Farhat, Mayor Hammoud and community partners gathered for a roundtable discussion on how strategic state funding and legislative support can help communities continue to transform contaminated sites into new opportunities for growth.

Dearborn’s redevelopment success is already evident in projects like the McCollough-Unis School, a former contaminated industrial site that was remediated with EGLE brownfield funding and transformed into a state-of-the-art public school.

“We are grateful for the efforts of both EGLE and our state Representative Alabas Farhat for making this vital redevelopment tool more accessible to communities like Dearborn,” said Mayor Abdullah H. Hammoud. “We’ve already spearheaded several efforts to revitalize and repurpose underutilized properties to meet our development goals while maintaining public health and environmental standards. We’re confident Dearborn possesses the tools to see brownfields come to life once more, and with the greatest public benefit, and welcome this opportunity for increased brownfield investments in our city.”

However, escalating turbine costs, along with U.S. tariffs and recent policy shifts, may temper their momentum, especially as the One Big Beautiful Act remains a significant obstacle. Even so, accelerating transportation electrification is expected to fuel substantial near-term growth in the U.S. electric vehicle market, providing a meaningful boost to clean energy stocks. The forerunners in the U.S. alternative energy industry are Bloom Energy BE, OPAL Fuels OPAL and FuelCell Energy FCEL.

About the Industry

The Zacks Alternative Energy- Other industry can be fundamentally segregated into two sets of companies. While one group is involved in the generation and distribution of alternative energy and electricity from sources like wind, natural gas, biofuel, hydro and geothermal, the other is engaged in the development, design and installation of renewable projects involving these alternative energy sources. The industry also includes a handful of stocks that offer fuel cell energy solutions, which have gained popularity as affordable, clean energy options lately. Per the BloombergNEF report, published in September 2025, renewable energy investments set another record in the first half of 2025, rising 10% year over year to $386 billion. With similar or more investments expected in the coming years, the industry boasts solid growth opportunities for its participants.

3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Alternative Energy Industry

Wind Energy – A Major Driver of Growth: Wind energy is expanding quickly, supported by favorable policies, rising climate awareness, and its affordability as a renewable power source. Wind power is one of the lowest-cost energy sources, and ongoing technological improvements have enhanced its competitiveness against conventional fuels. Larger and more efficient turbines are delivering significantly higher output, improving overall project performance and profitability. These factors have created a strong market for wind energy. A recent Wood Mackenzie report has highlighted the sector’s rapid acceleration, projecting that the global wind industry will reach its second terawatt of capacity by 2030. According to the same report, global additions are expected to hit a record 170 GW in 2025, with more than 70 GW projected in the fourth quarter alone, the largest quarterly build ever. Wood Mackenzie also expects about 9.1 GW of wind additions per year over the next five years, totaling 46 GW by 2029 and cumulative wind capacity is projected to reach 196.5 GW. Together, these trends underscore a strong growth outlook for the U.S. wind sector, supporting broader expansion across the alternative energy industry.

EV Market Surge to Accelerate Clean Energy Adoption: Electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming a key force in reducing transportation-related emissions. Expanding EV charging infrastructure, government subsidies, tax credits, grants, and perks such as carpool-lane access, is prompting more U.S. consumers to transition from gasoline models to EVs. Meanwhile, lower battery costs are driving further growth in the U.S. EV market. According to Electric Cars Report, in the third quarter of 2025, U.S. EV sales shattered all previous records, hitting an all-time high of 438,487 EVs. It surged 40.7% sequentially and was up 29.6% from the prior-year level. Per a report by Statista, the EV market in the United States is projected to reach revenues of $105.8 billion in 2025. It is expected to show an annual growth rate (CAGR 2025-2030) of 8.57%, resulting in a projected market volume of $159.7 billion by 2030. Such an impressive outlook bolsters the prospects of clean energy stocks, which offer the largest electric vehicle charging network in the United States.

Increasing Costs Driven by Tariffs and OBBA: Escalating renewable installation costs have become a major hurdle for clean energy developers. In particular, higher steel prices, critical for manufacturing large wind turbine components, have recently pushed wind installation expenses even higher. Adding to the pressure, the U.S. government’s elevated import tariffs, introduced in early 2025, have further increased cost burdens across the wind sector.

According to a Wood Mackenzie report, tariffs and policy uncertainty have posed significant challenges for the market, causing a 50% decrease in turbine orders in the first half of 2025 compared to that a year ago, taking them to their lowest level since 2020. The OBBBA brought significant changes to the tax credits available for eligible clean energy components and facilities, including terminating the advanced manufacturing production tax credit for wind components sold after Dec. 31, 2027. To this end, it can be said that the expiration of tax credits drives project costs up far more than tariffs. Since these credits significantly reduce expenses, their expiration makes renewable energy development and production much more expensive.

Zacks Industry Rank Reflects Grim Outlook

The Zacks Alternative Energy industry is housed within the broader Zacks Oils-Energy sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #142, which places it in the bottom 41% of more than 243 Zacks industries.

Why it matters: Rare-earth magnets have become a prominent friction point in U.S.-China trade talks, as China currently dominates the supply of rare-earth materials.

The magnets are a critical component of most electronics, including drones and missiles, as well as electric vehicles and smartphones.

Between the lines: Earlier this month, the Trump administration approved a $620 million loan from the U.S. Department of War (formerly the Department of Defense) to Vulcan and took an equity stake in the company to help kick-start its production.

Driving the news: On Tuesday, Vulcan and North Carolina agreed to an incentive package worth around $17.5 million to build the factory in Benson, near the intersection of Interstate 40 and Interstate 95, if the company meets hiring and investment goals.

Johnston County and the town of Benson will also add incentives worth more than $94 million.

Vulcan had also been considering expanding in Ohio, according to state officials.

Zoom in: Vulcan will invest approximately $1 billion in the factory and hire 1,000 workers, with roles ranging from engineering and production to administrative management.

The minimum average wage at the plant will be around $82,000.

The jobs are expected to be created by 2029.

State of play: Vulcan, founded in 2023, has a small-scale demonstration facility in Durham that has already hit key milestones in production, Vulcan Elements CEO John Maslin previously told Axios.

The company was founded in Boston, but ultimately chose North Carolina after its executives performed an analysis of American markets with high-level talent, proximity to military installations, and a decent cost of living.

""The entire reason we built [that] facility was to go and make sure that we understood every nut and bolt of the commercial equipment that we're going to be using and understanding who our suppliers are,"" Maslin says.

""Minerals have really become the most powerful form of currency when it comes to foreign policy now,"" Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, previously told Axios.

The big picture: It's the latest economic win for North Carolina, which has announced a wide variety of expansions in the state this year, including a 14,000-job project from plane maker JetZero in Greensboro, a 1,200-job headquarters expansion from Scout Motors in Charlotte and a 400-job biomanufacturing facility from Genentech in Holly Springs.

What they're saying: Lee Lilley, North Carolina's commerce secretary, told Axios the state has tried to diversify the types of projects it recruits as a hedge against market uncertainty.

Dive Brief:

Peak Energy will supply up to 4.75 GWh of sodium-ion batteries to independent power producer Jupiter Power over the next five years, the company said Nov. 12.

The first phase of the agreement sees Peak supply 720 MWh of its energy storage modules to Jupiter for deployment in 2027. The deal includes a capacity reservation for as much as 4 GWh more between 2028 and 2030, Peak said.

Peak said the total contract value could exceed $500 million, making it the largest U.S. deal for sodium-ion batteries to date. The news comes a few months after Peak energized the United States’ first grid-scale sodium-ion battery facility, a 3.5-MWh project near Denver.

Dive Insight:

A spokesperson for Peak Energy said the first 720-MWh delivery would serve a single Jupiter Power project but declined to say where in the United States it would be. The remaining 4 GWh would be spread across multiple projects whose locations have yet to be determined, they added.

“This is a four-hour system, and we could deploy it in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Southwest Power Pool and other markets with market opportunity for four-hour plus duration,” Mike Geier, Jupiter Power’s chief technology officer, said in an email.

Jupiter Power’s website shows most of its active or under-construction installations are in West Texas, within ERCOT territory. Its “development footprint” encompasses broad swathes of the southwestern, south-central, north-central and northeastern United States, including the entirety of the PJM Interconnection, New York Independent System Operator and Independent System Operator-New England regions.

Jupiter says it has more than 12 GW in development.

Peak batteries use a fully passive design that the company says eliminates the need for active cooling and slashes auxiliary power use by up to 97% compared with lithium-ion systems. They cost less to operate and degrade nearly 30% slower over 20 years, according to Peak.

“We see sodium-ion as one of the most promising alternatives to lithium-ion, and Peak’s approach offers lower degradation, lower lifetime O&M needs and a fully passive cooling system that simplifies operations and supports safer performance,” Geier said.

Despite their apparent advantages, grid-connected sodium-ion battery capacity remains a tiny part of the global energy storage mix amid a long-term decline in lithium-ion module pricing and corresponding improvements in safety and energy density.

But sodium-ion deployments have ticked up in China over the past few years as energy storage developers look to diversify away from lithium. Industry experts believe the technology could make a dent in lithium’s U.S. dominance by 2030 as well.

Ravi Manghani, senior director of strategic sourcing at the energy intelligence firm Anza, said in an email that his company is beginning to track sodium-ion storage more closely amid a challenging trade and regulatory environment for lithium batteries and their inputs.

“With new [foreign entity of concern] rules reshaping eligibility for tax credits starting in 2026 as well as a volatile tariff environment, interest in alternative chemistries like sodium-ion is growing quickly,” Manghani said.

Geier said Jupiter’s deal with Peak “supports our broader domestic supply strategy.”

Anza doesn’t expect a dramatic change anytime soon, however. They see sodium-ion’s global market share rising from “1% to 2% today to the low-single-digit range over the next few years,” Manghani said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/45mKYLbHOsoLenWYQWHJcxobCLbJ-QgWBygtGYHHKDo/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9QZWFrX0VuZXJneV9zb2RpdW0taW9uX3N0b3JhZ2UuanBn.webp,N,,2025-11-18 14:00:52.923167

Factories in West Virginia, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee and Missouri will see 252 new jobs as a result of the initiative, the world’s biggest carmaker said in a statement.

The move underscores Toyota’s bet that hybrids will dominate US sales in the near term as consumers balk at high EV prices following the end of tax credits. The investment may also strengthen the Japanese carmaker’s foothold in the market as Ford Motor, General Motors and other US carmakers scale back EV ambitions and revisit hybrid strategies to meet shifting demand and emissions targets.

“The cause is still unknown and is currently under investigation,” Rocky Mountain Power Senior Communications Specialist Jona Whitesides said Friday afternoon.
But it’s unclear what it might require of Rocky Mountain Power, the state’s largest regulated electric utility, in terms of a report or accountability.
“They haven’t told us anything.” The lack of communication from Rocky Mountain Power to local responders is nothing new, Dalgarn added.
The power outage began around 12:45 p.m. Thursday.","The massive, multi-utility power outage that left more than 100,000 customers in Wyoming, South Dakota and Montana without electricity Thursday resulted from a failure in Rocky Mountain Power’s system in Wyoming, the company says. But the utility, so far, isn’t offering specific details.

“The cause is still unknown and is currently under investigation,” Rocky Mountain Power Senior Communications Specialist Jona Whitesides said Friday afternoon. “Given the complexity of this event, the investigation to determine the root cause and precise order of events on the system will take time.”

The company is investigating the incident internally, Whitesides added. It’s unclear how much detail it will offer to the public or when.

“The exact duration [to determine the cause] is not known at this time,” Whitesides said.

The Western Area Power Administration, which manages hydroelectric power and transmission lines across several western states and was impacted by the interruption, initially described the cause as “triggered by two tripped 500-kilovolt lines near Medicine Bow, Wyoming.”

The term “tripped,” in the industry, typically refers to an automatic shutoff in response to a power disruption.

The event resulted in “abnormal voltage,” the power administration added on Friday, which shut down power transmission lines in the region, where multiple utilities and rural electric co-ops share an interconnected grid.

“What we do know,” Rocky Mountain Power’s Whitesides said, “is that it impacted PacifiCorp [Rocky Mountain Power’s parent company], WAPA and Black Hills Energy, which include customers in Wyoming, South Dakota and Montana.”

The “bulk power system” outage darkened homes and businesses throughout central and northeast Wyoming for varying lengths of time, including coal mines in the Powder River Basin, oil and natural gas refineries, and led to a fire at Rocky Mountain Power’s Dave Johnston coal-fired power plant near Glenrock.

The fire “was quickly extinguished,” Whitesides said. “Safety systems operated as designed, protecting employees and equipment. No injuries occurred and some equipment damage was reported.”

The unusual, far-reaching scale of the outage is a significant grid reliability issue, according to one industry official who spoke with WyoFile. The event could spur a federal investigation, perhaps by the Western Electricity Coordinating Council, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, which develops and enforces grid reliability standards.

Inquiries to those agencies were not returned by press time.

“Certainly, it isn’t just going to be a blip on the radar,” Powder River Energy Corporation Vice President of Member Service Joe Roth told WyoFile. “There’s definitely going to be accountability held at one of those federal levels.”

The Wyoming Public Service Commission also requires reliability standards, according to the agency. But it’s unclear what it might require of Rocky Mountain Power, the state’s largest regulated electric utility, in terms of a report or accountability. “It appears that there may be a federal investigation into the matter,” Commission Chief Counsel John Burbridge told WyoFile.

“While state and federal agencies may choose to conduct their own reviews, at this time we have not been notified of any [outside] investigations,” Rocky Mountain Power’s Whitesides said. “PacifiCorp has submitted reports about the event to the U.S. Department of Energy, the Wyoming Public Service Commission and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation.”

At least one local emergency management coordinator expressed frustration with Rocky Mountain Power for not being responsive to questions during and immediately following the power outage and the resulting fire at the Dave Johnston power plant, which is owned and operated by the utility.

“I wish I could tell you exactly what happened there, and I honestly cannot,” Converse County Emergency Management Coordinator Russ Dalgarn told WyoFile on Friday regarding the Dave Johnston fire. “They haven’t told us anything.”

The lack of communication from Rocky Mountain Power to local responders is nothing new, Dalgarn added. The utility is “notorious” for not sharing information with local emergency responders, Dalgarn said.

Asked to respond, Whitesides said, “I am surprised by that because our relationships with state and local first responders and emergency managers have been very collaborative, and we value those relationships very much.”

Utilities affected by the Rocky Mountain Power disruption reported that their systems automatically shut down — a built-in safety response.

“Although the sudden loss of electricity across an entire region came as a jolt to residents and businesses who operate here, the [Powder River Energy Corporation] systems that protect infrastructure and consumers performed as designed as it responded to the high and low voltage scenarios,” the company said.

The power outage began around 12:45 p.m. Thursday.

New large-load customers

In the third quarter, the electric utility that accounts for the lion’s share of CMS Energy’s revenue reported a 16% year-over-year increase in operating revenue, though electricity deliveries were largely flat since last year, the company said Oct. 30.

The Michigan-based company attributed the revenue increase — and corresponding growth in the parent company’s earnings per share — primarily to favorable weather and constructive regulatory developments in its home state.

But it has also interconnected 450 MW of new industrial loads in recent quarters, about half the 900 MW of large-load growth it expects through 2029. Additions include semiconductor and solar cell factories near Saginaw, a Ford battery plant near Marshall and an expanded Switch data center south of Grand Rapids.

CMS Energy operates electric and gas utilities in Michigan under the Consumers Energy banner. Its third business line is NorthStar Clean Energy, an independent power producer and energy project developer. The two utilities each serve about 1.8 million customers across Lower Michigan, with the electric business accounting for well over 75% of combined revenues.

The recent large-load additions represent the first wave of an expected 9 GW pipeline over the next decade-plus. CMS has 1 GW to 2 GW of industrial load in the “final stages” of contracting, according to the company’s third-quarter investor presentation.

That includes a yet-unnamed data center that could draw up to 1 GW beginning in 2030 and two other data centers “a bit behind” in contracting, CMS Energy President and CEO Garrick Rochow said in an earnings call on Oct. 30.

Rochow said the Michigan Public Service Commission’s approval of a special tariff for loads greater than 100 MW would enable those and future data center deals. Consumers Energy’s largest customer today draws 28 MW, the commission says.

Campbell coal plant emergency orders expected to continue

Rochow and CMS Energy Chief Financial Officer Rejji Hayes said they expect the Trump administration to repeatedly renew its order that Consumers keep running the 1.5-GW J.H. Campbell power plant.

Hayes stressed that the costs associated with Campbell’s continued operation would be socialized across the Midcontinent Independent System Operator’s North and Central regions, sparing Michigan ratepayers the full brunt. He noted that the plant “is being operated for the benefit of the region,” per the Energy Department order — a condition that has raised alarms among ratepayer advocates and spurred environmental groups and large electricity consumers to sue.

“I think it’s important to note that we’re trying our best to make sure that Michigan customers are held harmless,” Hayes said.

It cost Consumers Energy $164 million to run the Campbell plant from May 23 through Sept. 30, CMS said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In that period, the utility received $94 million in revenue selling power from the plant into MISO’s market, leaving the utility with $80 million in net costs, the company said.

Support from Michigan regulators, clean energy law

Consumers Energy benefits from a “constructive” regulatory environment and strong state support for the utility’s clean energy goals, CMS Energy said in the third-quarter presentation.

In a June filing in the electric utility’s pending rate case, PSC staff supported about 75% of its 10.25% return on equity request and about 90% of its revised capital request. That followed a March order in a prior rate case granting the electric utility a $154 million revenue increase to support grid reliability and resilience investments.

Additionally, the commission approved 8 GW of solar capacity and 2.8 GW of wind for inclusion in the electric utility’s next renewable energy plan, which will map out Consumers’ clean energy investments through 2035. Both Michigan and Consumers aim to retire coal and reach net-zero emissions in the power sector by 2040.

On Oct. 30, Rochow said the integrated resource plan Consumers expects to file in mid-2026 will have more on near- and mid-term investments to replace retired plants and support expected load growth. He said the plan would likely include “more battery storage and gas capacity,” with the mix of simple-cycle and possible combined-cycle gas plant investments dependent on the utility’s data center pipeline. Consumers will reveal more about those plans on its next investor call, he said.

The Natural Resources Defense Council and the Sierra Club asked an appeals court on Monday to overturn the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s approval of the Southwest Power Pool’s capacity accreditation methodology, which the groups say favors fossil-fueled power plants.

The lawsuit comes as grid operators such as the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, PJM Interconnection and ISO New England have been making changes to how they measure capacity to ensure they have adequate resources to maintain grid reliability.

Under SPP’s plan approved by FERC in mid-July, the grid operator will set an Effective Load Carrying Capability accreditation methodology for wind, solar and energy storage resources and a performance-based accreditation methodology for conventional resources, according to the suit filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit by Earthjustice.

“Fair and accurate resource evaluation should be the minimum expectation for any grid operator,” Sierra Club Senior Attorney Greg Wannier said in a statement.

SPP’s plan artificially props up the value of coal- and gas-fired generation, according to Wannier. “This double standard will force customers to pay more money for less reliable electric service, and increases the risk of life-threatening power outages during the next heat wave or winter storm,” he said.

SPP contends the new accreditation methodologies will give it a better understanding of which resources will be available when needed, based on their past performance. SPP operates the electric system and wholesale power markets in 14 states from eastern New Mexico to Montana.

In joint comments on SPP’s proposal in March, the NRDC, the Sierra Club and the Sustainable FERC Project said the grid operator’s proposed methodology for thermal power plants failed to evaluate resources based on their performance during high-risk hours.

“The over-accreditation of thermal resources in SPP’s proposed thermal methodology, if not corrected by the Commission, will impose undue costs on ratepayers, and presents a long-term risk to the reliability of the [regional transmission organization’s] grid,” the groups said.

About the Industry

The Zacks Alternative Energy- Other industry can be fundamentally segregated into two sets of companies. While one group is involved in the generation and distribution of alternative energy and electricity from sources like wind, natural gas, biofuel, hydro and geothermal, the other is engaged in the development, design and installation of renewable projects involving these alternative energy sources. The industry also includes a handful of stocks that offer fuel cell energy solutions, which have gained popularity as affordable, clean energy options lately. Per the BloombergNEF report, published in September 2025, renewable energy investments set another record in the first half of 2025, rising 10% year over year to $386 billion. With similar or more investments expected in the coming years, the industry boasts solid growth opportunities for its participants.

3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Alternative Energy Industry

Wind Energy – A Major Driver of Growth: Wind energy is expanding quickly, supported by favorable policies, rising climate awareness, and its affordability as a renewable power source. Wind power is one of the lowest-cost energy sources, and ongoing technological improvements have enhanced its competitiveness against conventional fuels. Larger and more efficient turbines are delivering significantly higher output, improving overall project performance and profitability. These factors have created a strong market for wind energy. A recent Wood Mackenzie report has highlighted the sector’s rapid acceleration, projecting that the global wind industry will reach its second terawatt of capacity by 2030. According to the same report, global additions are expected to hit a record 170 GW in 2025, with more than 70 GW projected in the fourth quarter alone, the largest quarterly build ever. Wood Mackenzie also expects about 9.1 GW of wind additions per year over the next five years, totaling 46 GW by 2029 and cumulative wind capacity is projected to reach 196.5 GW. Together, these trends underscore a strong growth outlook for the U.S. wind sector, supporting broader expansion across the alternative energy industry.

EV Market Surge to Accelerate Clean Energy Adoption: Electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming a key force in reducing transportation-related emissions. Expanding EV charging infrastructure, government subsidies, tax credits, grants, and perks such as carpool-lane access, is prompting more U.S. consumers to transition from gasoline models to EVs. Meanwhile, lower battery costs are driving further growth in the U.S. EV market. According to Electric Cars Report, in the third quarter of 2025, U.S. EV sales shattered all previous records, hitting an all-time high of 438,487 EVs. It surged 40.7% sequentially and was up 29.6% from the prior-year level. Per a report by Statista, the EV market in the United States is projected to reach revenues of $105.8 billion in 2025. It is expected to show an annual growth rate (CAGR 2025-2030) of 8.57%, resulting in a projected market volume of $159.7 billion by 2030. Such an impressive outlook bolsters the prospects of clean energy stocks, which offer the largest electric vehicle charging network in the United States.

Increasing Costs Driven by Tariffs and OBBA: Escalating renewable installation costs have become a major hurdle for clean energy developers. In particular, higher steel prices, critical for manufacturing large wind turbine components, have recently pushed wind installation expenses even higher. Adding to the pressure, the U.S. government’s elevated import tariffs, introduced in early 2025, have further increased cost burdens across the wind sector.

According to a Wood Mackenzie report, tariffs and policy uncertainty have posed significant challenges for the market, causing a 50% decrease in turbine orders in the first half of 2025 compared to that a year ago, taking them to their lowest level since 2020. The OBBBA brought significant changes to the tax credits available for eligible clean energy components and facilities, including terminating the advanced manufacturing production tax credit for wind components sold after Dec. 31, 2027. To this end, it can be said that the expiration of tax credits drives project costs up far more than tariffs. Since these credits significantly reduce expenses, their expiration makes renewable energy development and production much more expensive.

Zacks Industry Rank Reflects Grim Outlook

The Zacks Alternative Energy industry is housed within the broader Zacks Oils-Energy sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #142, which places it in the bottom 41% of more than 243 Zacks industries.

The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates gloomy near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

The industry’s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is due to a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.

The groups have asked the PSC to create a separate customer class, which would force new data center customers to pay the costs associated with their electricity supply rather than shifting the cost to residential ratepayers.
The groups have also asked the PSC to require NorthWestern to comply with ratepayer-protective rules, in the form of a mandatory tariff, when meeting data center demand.
The groups argue that granting both of these requests is necessary to protect NorthWestern’s residential customers because of the extremely large loads contemplated by data centers.
In October, the plaintiffs sent a letter to the PSC noting the lack of transparency around NorthWestern’s data center plans and urging a denial of the protective order.","—

Community, conservation, and Indigenous-led organizations yesterday filed a complaint before the Montana Public Service Commission (PSC) challenging NorthWestern Energy’s intent to provide electricity supply service to large load data centers without first proving that it will not adversely impact existing ratepayers. The groups, represented by Earthjustice, warn that NorthWestern’s data center agreements could increase costs for residential ratepayers and deepen the state’s reliance on expensive fossil fuels.

Quotes from Petitioners.

The complaint targets NorthWestern’s efforts to provide electricity to data centers without the opportunity for public input or the required approval from the PSC. Montana law requires NorthWestern to first demonstrate that providing service to new large load customers will not adversely impact existing ratepayers over the long term. In September, NorthWestern informed the PSC that it does not intend to disclose information on impacts to existing customers before it begins providing service to data centers as early as January 2026.

The groups have asked the PSC to create a separate customer class, which would force new data center customers to pay the costs associated with their electricity supply rather than shifting the cost to residential ratepayers. The groups have also asked the PSC to require NorthWestern to comply with ratepayer-protective rules, in the form of a mandatory tariff, when meeting data center demand. The groups argue that granting both of these requests is necessary to protect NorthWestern’s residential customers because of the extremely large loads contemplated by data centers.

NorthWestern has entered into letters of intent to provide as much as 1,400 megawatts of electricity supply to three data center developers in Montana, approximately double the utility’s current average retail daily load. To serve this extreme demand, NorthWestern would need to make transmission upgrades and likely obtain new sources of electricity generation, which would likely lead to further increases in utility bills for NorthWestern’s other customers.

NorthWestern has filed a motion for a protective order for its letters of intent with data centers after the commission requested additional information on the customers mentioned in the utility company’s press releases. In October, the plaintiffs sent a letter to the PSC noting the lack of transparency around NorthWestern’s data center plans and urging a denial of the protective order.

Supply-chain strains are hitting even the workhorse of the power grid: natural gas turbines.","Two new data centers in Silicon Valley have been built but can’t begin processing information: The equipment that would supply them with electricity isn’t available.

It’s just one example of a crisis facing the U.S. power grid that can’t be solved simply by building more power lines, approving new power generation, or changing out grid software. The equipment needed to keep the grid running—transformers that regulate voltage, circuit breakers that protect against faults, high-voltage cables that carry power across regions, and steel poles that hold the network together—is hard to make, and materials are limited. Supply-chain bottlenecks are taking years to clear, delaying projects, inflating costs, and threatening reliability.

Meanwhile, U.S. electricity demand is surging from several sources—electrification of home and business appliances and equipment, increased domestic manufacturing, and growth in AI data centers. Without the right equipment, these efforts may take years longer and cost vast sums more than planners expect.

Not enough transformers to replace aging units

Transformers are key to the electricity grid: They regulate voltage as power travels across the wires, increasing voltage for more efficient long-distance transmission, and decreasing it for medium-distance travel and again for delivery to buildings.

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory estimates that the U.S. has about 60 million to 80 million high-voltage distribution transformers in service. More than half of them are 33-plus years old—approaching or exceeding their expected lifespans.

Replacing them has become costly and time-consuming, with utilities reporting that transformers cost four to six times what they cost before 2022, in addition to the multiyear wait times.

To meet rising electricity demand, the country will need many more of them—perhaps twice as many as already exist.

The North American Electric Reliability Corp. says the lead time, the wait between placing an order and the product being delivered, hit roughly 120 weeks (more than two years) in 2024, with large power transformers taking as long as 210 weeks (up to four years). Even smaller transformers used to reduce voltage for distribution to homes and businesses are back-ordered as much as two years. Those delays have slowed both maintenance and new construction across much of the grid.

Transformer production depends heavily on a handful of materials and suppliers. The cores of most U.S transformers use grain-oriented electrical steel, a special type of steel with particular magnetic properties, which is made domestically only by Cleveland-Cliffs at plants in Pennsylvania and Ohio. Imports have long filled the gap: Roughly 80% of large transformers have historically been imported from Mexico, China, and Thailand. But global demand has also surged, tightening access to steel, as well as copper, a soft metal that conducts electricity well and is crucial in wiring.

In partial recognition of these shortages, in April 2024, the U.S. Department of Energy delayed the enforcement of new energy-efficiency rules for transformers, to avoid making the situation worse.

Further slowing progress, these items cannot be mass-produced. They must be designed, tested, and certified individually.

Even when units are built, getting them to where they are needed can be a feat. Large power transformers often weigh between 100 tons and 400 tons and require specialized transport—sometimes needing one of only about 10 suitable super-heavy-load railcars in the country. Those logistics alone can add months to a replacement project, according to the Department of Energy.

Other key equipment

Transformers are not the only grid machinery facing delays. A Duke University Nicholas Institute study, citing data from research and consulting firm Wood Mackenzie, shows that high-voltage circuit-breaker lead times reached about 151 weeks (nearly three years) by late 2023, roughly double pre-pandemic norms.

Facing similar delays are a range of equipment types, such as transmission cables that can handle high voltages, switchgear—a technical category that includes switches, circuit breakers, and fuses—and insulators to keep electricity from going where it would be dangerous.

For transmission projects, equipment delays can derail timelines. High-voltage direct-current cables now take more than 24 months to procure, and offshore wind projects are particularly strained: Orders for undersea cables can take more than a decade to fill. And fewer than 50 cable-laying vessels operate worldwide, limiting how quickly manufacturers can install them, even once they are manufactured.

Supply-chain strains are hitting even the workhorse of the power grid: natural gas turbines. Manufacturers, including Siemens Energy and GE Vernova, have multiyear backlogs as new data centers, industrial electrification, and peaking-capacity projects flood the order books. Siemens recently reported a record $158 billion backlog, with some turbine frames sold out for as long as seven years.

Alternate approaches

As a result of these delays, utility companies are finding other ways to meet demand, such as battery storage, actively managing electricity demand, upgrading existing equipment to produce more power, or even reviving decommissioned generation sites.

Some utilities are stockpiling materials for their own use or to sell to other companies, which can shrink delays from years to weeks.

There have been various other efforts, too. In addition to delaying transformer efficiency requirements, the Biden administration awarded Cleveland-Cliffs $500 million to upgrade its electrical-steel plants—but key elements of that grant were canceled by the Trump administration.

Utilities and industry groups are exploring standardized designs and modular substations to cut lead times—but acknowledge that those are medium-term fixes, not quick solutions.

Large government incentives, including grants, loans, and guaranteed-purchase agreements, could help expand domestic production of these materials and supplies. But for now, the numbers remain stark: roughly 120 weeks for transformers, up to four years for large units, nearly three years for breakers, and more than two years for high-voltage cable manufacturing. Until the underlying supply-chain choke points—steel, copper, insulation materials, and heavy transport—expand meaningfully, utilities are managing reliability not through construction but through choreography.

According to Google, energy abundance, grid stability and cost discipline are integral to the planning model for all its Texas campuses.
Developing a skilled workforce for AI infrastructure Google frames its workforce development plan as a critical component of the construction schedule.","Google is set to deepen its presence in Texas, confirming a US$40bn investment in the state through to 2027.

The large-scale programme is focused on developing new cloud and AI infrastructure, with a clear strategic link to increasing energy capacity and investing in workforce training.

This includes proposals for three new data centres on campuses in Armstrong and Haskell Counties and the expansion of its existing data centre facilities in Ellis County.

Having maintained a presence in Texas for over 15 years, Google confirms this new commitment supports a data centre plan across multiple sites.

Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, says the move is “a major expansion of our commitment to the Lone Star State”.

In a social media post, he explained that the investment is designed to support technological progress, saying: “AI is poised to accelerate a new golden age of American innovation and Texas – with its optimism and talent – is leading the way.

""To power this progress, we must invest in world-leading infrastructure and the people who build it. That's why we are investing more than US$40bn in Texas through 2027 to expand our cloud and AI infrastructure.”

Strategic infrastructure and AI investment

Google says the plan for Armstrong and Haskell Counties will proceed alongside an expanded buildout in Ellis County.

All sites are being positioned to handle the next generation of Search, Maps and AI workloads.

Each location is part of a broader cloud region design that combines capacity, connectivity and energy planning within a single programme.

“We've proudly called Texas home for over 15 years, from our offices and existing data centres, to Waymo in Austin, to Wing deliveries in the Dallas-Fort Worth area,” Sundar says.

“Thank you to Governor Greg Abbott for your partnership to drive economic development and innovation – we look forward to Texas being a vital engine that powers the opportunities AI will create for years to come.""

Texas Governor Greg Abbott adds: “This is a Texas-sized investment in the future of our great state. Texas is the epicentre of AI development, where companies can pair innovation with expanding energy.”

Integrating energy solutions with data centre expansion

A core principle of Google's Texas expansion is that new energy is brought to the grid as new data centre capacity becomes available.

The company intends to cover the full costs associated with its operations, while also supporting energy efficiency programmes in local communities.

To this end, Google has confirmed a new US$30m Energy Impact Fund, created to scale and accelerate community energy projects.

This is combined with over 6,200MW of new energy generation and capacity through power purchase agreements with energy developers. One of the new data centres in Haskell County is situated next to a solar and battery storage plant.

The colocation is designed to support both day-to-day operations and power stability for the facility. According to Google, energy abundance, grid stability and cost discipline are integral to the planning model for all its Texas campuses.

Developing a skilled workforce for AI infrastructure

Google frames its workforce development plan as a critical component of the construction schedule.

The electrical training ALLIANCE will partner with the company to train existing electrical workers and over 1,700 apprentices in Texas by 2030. Google claims this initiative will more than double the projected pipeline of new electricians in the state.

The company outlines that extensive electrical training is fundamental to its Texas infrastructure strategy, as data centre construction relies on specialist skills in high voltage systems, plant installation and on-site commissioning.

Funding from Google will support the programme, helping to ensure the state’s workforce can grow in parallel with the region’s cloud and AI footprint.

Google states its investment is structured to support the Texas workforce, the statewide infrastructure and the national AI capability that relies on secure, high-capacity data centre regions.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/1bf04c82536fe3741602e8c312e9291c:0e73081154844f7cbdfd2c1c5ae94cc4/sundar-pichai-ceo-google-and-alphabet.webp.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 12:09:11.419137

Beyond its operations, the company is improving local watershed health near its offices and data centers, with a goal to replenish 120% of the water it consumes, on average, by 2030. In 2021, Google invested €45 million in the construction of a water treatment plant that processes water from the Eemskanaal and supplies it to companies in the Groningen port areas for cooling, including Google's data center in the Eemshaven.

Boosting the digital economy in The Netherlands and Europe

The Netherlands has an incredible opportunity with AI. An Implement Consulting study, commissioned in 2024 by Google, found that generative AI alone could boost The Netherland’s gross domestic product (GDP) by €80-85 billion, amounting to +9% GDP over ten years with widespread adoption. Another study by Implement Consulting, commissioned by Google in 2025, found that public administration in the Netherlands can unlock a €6 billion opportunity solely by adopting generative AI for administrative processes. Digital infrastructure is the engine behind this growing AI economy. Google has invested more than €3.7 billion in The Netherlands in digital infrastructure. According to a study by Deloitte, Google’s historical data center investments in The Netherlands are estimated to have generated an average annual GDP contribution of €1,96 billion in GDP from 2022 to 2024, having supported an average of 12,600 jobs per year during that period.

“The opening of Google's new data center is a critical development for our operations and for the entire Dutch digital ecosystem. As a Google Cloud customer, this increased capacity, especially for AI-powered services, means we can innovate faster, maintain high performance, and scale our business with greater confidence. Moreover, Google's ongoing investment in digital infrastructure and clean energy directly supports the country’s AI ambitions, making a tangible contribution to the growth and competitiveness of the Dutch economy overall.” said Jan Baan, CEO, Omoda.

Google broke ground on the site in December 2023. Already today, Google works with nearly 160 Dutch suppliers, including 77 from the province of Groningen, for its data center operations in the country. Google’s data center facilities in The Netherlands, including the site in Winschoten, currently create jobs for approximately 700 people in full-time and contractor roles — from computer technicians to electrical and mechanical engineers, to security, catering and facilities management.

Alderman Erich Wünker, Alderman for Economic Affairs and Land Development & Services for the municipality of Oldambt, is proud of Google's location in Oldambt on behalf of the Municipal Executive. ""It's a company with international appeal. Ultramodern, progressive in areas like sustainability, technology, and data centers. Not just for now, but also for the future."" International, but also clearly linked to the region and Oldambt itself, according to Wünker, especially when it comes to employment. ""It involves several dozen structural jobs, in various roles; from technology to security."" Wünker praises the contact and collaboration between the municipality of Oldambt and Google, such as the future Circular Center. ""Google is clearly demonstrating that the company also cares about the local economy and takes responsibility for it.""

Circular Center in Winschoten

Google wants to be a good neighbour and support its data center communities, and has contributed over 2.5 million euros to the communities surrounding its Dutch facilities since 2018, supporting over 80 community initiatives across education, digital skilling and more.

Google is also announcing a partnership with the municipality of Oldambt, WerkPro, Afeer and Cosis, to develop a Circular Centre right across the data center site. This initiative aims to foster a circular economy by collecting, sorting, and reusing materials, while also serving as a social and educational hub. Key operations include repair services and the dismantling of electrical goods, both promoting social inclusion and employment. The project also integrates educational opportunities, guiding 12 students annually in practical, circular economy-focused learning. The modular shed, approximately 196 m² across two floors, will employ approximately 10 full-time workers and process 10 to 12 tons of material annually once fully operational..

Google’s investments enable the advancement of AI and digital technologies creating significant opportunities for Europe to enhance economic competitiveness, productivity, and scientific progress in service of thriving and sustainable societies. Google is dedicated to playing a vital role in this journey by providing essential products and services, investing in critical infrastructure, supporting workforce upskilling, enhancing cybersecurity and safety, and collaborating throughout Europe to develop and deploy AI responsibly for the benefit of all.",https://www.googlecloudpresscorner.com/image/GC_socialsharing.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 12:06:06.145339

Georgia’s clean energy workforce added 3,292 new workers in 2024, growing 4 percent and adding jobs at a rate more than 5 times faster than the state’s overall employment, which grew at less than 0.8 percent. The state ranked 15th for largest clean energy workforce in 2024, with 83,535 clean energy jobs in total. The bulk of the workforce were in the construction and manufacturing industries, with about 43,800 and 13,200 workers respectively. In 2024, clean energy accounted for over seven times more jobs than fossil fuels in Georgia while three Georgia counties made the top 100 list for counties with the most clean energy jobs in the nation: Fulton County (15,976 jobs), Cobb County (7,778 jobs), and Gwinnett County (7,321 jobs).

It’s important to note that the jobs data in this report predates the July 2025 passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which has been forecast to slow clean energy job growth nationwide. Still, these numbers point to a resilient and increasingly essential industry and workforce. As energy demand grows, Georgia’s clean energy companies and workers are positioned to play an even greater role in shaping the state’s economic future.

News Release

Thanks to solar and nuclear, U.S. power generation to grow 57% by 2050

EIR report details coal’s exit, renewable energy trends, and the future of U.S. electricity supply

CALGARY, Alberta (Nov. 18, 2025) Enverus Intelligence® Research (EIR), a subsidiary of Enverus, the most trusted energy-dedicated SaaS company that leverages generative AI across its solutions, is releasing its long-term U.S. power capacity expansion outlook, based on proprietary load forecasts, interconnection queue analytics and technology cost curves.

EIR projects a 57% increase in installed U.S. power capacity by 2050, driven by three distinct eras: rapid solar energy growth through 2028, a mid-term shift as coal-fired power is fully retired and replaced by natural gas and nuclear power, and steady long-term growth led by the ramp-up of the U.S. nuclear industry. Renewable energy installations are expected to peak in 2028 but remain competitive, supported by ongoing demand for power purchase agreements (PPAs) and low costs.

“Our analysis shows the U.S. grid is entering a transformative period, with solar installations surging in the near term and nuclear power taking a leading role in the decades ahead. The retirement of coal and the rise of new technologies will reshape regional generation mixes and drive innovation in grid reliability and energy sustainability,” said Juan Arteaga, PhD, principal analyst at EIR.

Key takeaways:

Installed U.S. power capacity is forecast to grow 57% by 2050, with three eras: rapid solar energy growth (2025–2035), coal replacement (2035–2040) and steady nuclear expansion (2040–2050).

Renewable energy installations will peak in 2028 but remain competitive as tax credits phase out, thanks to strong PPA demand and low costs.

Coal-fired power is projected to be fully retired by 2040, replaced evenly by natural gas and nuclear power. The Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) region will see over 25 GW of fuel switching.

Wind energy, natural gas and nuclear power are the most load-sensitive technologies, with capacity buildout remaining relatively inelastic to changes in demand.

Battery storage and gas peaker plants will play a crucial role in grid reliability, while combined-cycle natural gas and nuclear plants provide essential baseload support.

EIR’s analysis pulls from a variety of products including Enverus PRISM, Enverus FOUNDATIONS® – Power & Renewables and Enverus Instant Analyst™.

Some countries are already showing how integrating ocean action across sectors can advance both climate and development goals.
Coordinated by WRI, the Ocean & Climate Platform and Ocean Conservancy, the Challenge welcomes six new members today at COP30 – Belgium, Cambodia, Canada, Indonesia, Portugal and Singapore.
“Meeting global climate goals won’t happen in isolation,” said Melanie Robinson, said WRI’s Global Climate, Economics and Finance Program Director.
Report co-authors: World Resources Institute, Ocean Conservancy, Ocean & Climate Platform, Oceans 5, NDC Partnership, Food and Agriculture Organization, and the Nature Conservancy.","The report comes as six countries join the Blue NDC Challenge at COP30 to accelerate ocean action in national climate commitments – including Belgium, Cambodia, Canada, Indonesia, Portugal and Singapore

Belém, Brazil (November 18, 2025) – The ocean is increasingly being recognized in national climate plans – but most countries are still overlooking the most powerful actions to cut emissions and build resilience, according to a new report led by World Resources Institute (WRI), with Ocean Conservancy and Ocean & Climate Platform, released today at COP30 in Belém.

Of 66 newly submitted Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) from coastal and island countries, 61 include at least one ocean-related measure*. That marks an increase from 62% in 2015, to 73% in 2022, and now 92% of NDCs submitted so far for the 2025 NDC cycle.

Yet the most transformative measures – such as phasing out offshore oil and gas, decarbonizing shipping, expanding offshore renewables, and scaling sustainable seafood – remain rare, making up just 12% of ocean actions. Countries are still only scratching the surface of the ocean’s climate potential.

Research from the Ocean Panel shows that ocean-based climate solutions can deliver up to 35% of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions needed to limit warming to 1.5°C by 2050 – a major missed opportunity if left untapped.

“With the window to cut emissions rapidly closing, coastal and island countries yet to submit their NDCs must recognize the ocean as a powerful, underused ally in meeting global climate goals.” said Tom Pickerell, Global Director for WRI's Ocean Program. “Despite growing momentum, ocean-based climate solutions remain underfunded and overlooked. What’s needed at this COP is bold recognition of the ocean’s potential – and action to deploy proven solutions at scale.""

Some countries are already showing how integrating ocean action across sectors can advance both climate and development goals.

Republic of the Marshall Islands: Its NDC includes cutting domestic shipping emissions by 40% by 2030, testing innovative Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion technology to generate clean energy, and managing fisheries to safeguard cultural heritage and livelihoods. The country has also designated nearly 48,000 km² of ocean as protected sanctuaries.

Brazil: Its NDC aims to generate 16 GW of offshore wind energy by 2050 and establish the regulatory framework to make this expansion possible – creating jobs, strengthening energy independence and advancing a clean energy future for the country.

Separate research by the Ocean Panel suggests that every $1 invested in ocean solutions could yield at least $5 in global benefits by 2050. Conversely, continuing harmful and unsustainable ocean practices could result in more than $8 trillion in losses by 2050.

“There's a huge gap between the promise of ocean-climate solutions and the pace at which we are adopting them,” said Anna-Maria Laura, Senior Director of Climate Policy at Ocean Conservancy. “The gap isn’t in science or technology – it’s in funding and implementation. The ocean is sounding the alarm through stronger storms, dying coral reefs, and rising seas. But the ocean can also help us fight back through solutions like offshore wind. It’s time to fund and implement these solutions as if the future of our ocean and our planet depend on them – because they do.”

The report also highlights the urgent need for countries to rapidly step up measures to adapt to the effects of a changing climate. Island and coastal countries face especially high stakes, with over 680 million people currently living in low-lying coastal zones at risk from rising seas and coastal erosion – a figure expected to surpass 1 billion by 2050.

The latest NDCs show some progress on adaptation: in fact, over 90% of ocean actions focus on adaptation, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean and Oceania. Yet the pace and scale of action remain far too low to protect vulnerable communities and livelihoods, and gaps in technology and knowledge transfer hold back effective action. Alarmingly, just 13% of ocean-based actions explicitly address equity, even though women, youth, Indigenous Peoples, and local coastal communities are often hit hardest by climate impacts.

To help close these gaps, the Blue NDC Challenge, launched earlier this year by France and Brazil, helps countries in strengthen and implement ocean-climate actions in their national commitments. Coordinated by WRI, the Ocean & Climate Platform and Ocean Conservancy, the Challenge welcomes six new members today at COP30 – Belgium, Cambodia, Canada, Indonesia, Portugal and Singapore. Together, these countries will form the Blue NDC Taskforce to drive implementation of ocean commitments in the 2025 NDC cycle, by mobilizing political leadership, technical expertise and investment.

“Meeting global climate goals won’t happen in isolation,” said Melanie Robinson, said WRI’s Global Climate, Economics and Finance Program Director. “Countries, communities, and organizations must work together – sharing knowledge, aligning policies and scaling solutions. Initiatives like the Blue NDC Challenge show how collaboration can transform promises into action, shielding coastal communities from rising seas, creating green jobs, and charting the world toward a cleaner, more resilient future.”

“As countries move from promises to action, this round of climate plans must serve as clear roadmaps for guiding every step of the journey,"" said Loreley Picourt, Executive Director of the Ocean & Climate Platform. ""By directing investment, building capacity and scaling solutions, we can secure a resilient ocean – but if we fail, we risk undermining the foundation of life on our planet.”

EVs are still nowhere near as profitable or as popular as gas cars, yet they’re a necessity from a regulatory standpoint.","Porsche has come to grips with the reality that EV uptake isn’t progressing as rapidly as anticipated a few years ago. In early 2022, outgoing CEO Oliver Blume projected that as many as 80 percent of new car sales would be fully electric. That ambitious target is no longer in place, and the new plan is simple yet effective: giving people what they want.

Australia’s Drive magazine spoke with Porsche’s local Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director, who revealed the updated strategy is to cater to both sides. Daniel Schmollinger said the intent is to provide “freedom of choice for the customer depending on where they stand in terms of being ready for electric or still loving petrol [models].”

As a member of the Volkswagen Group, Porsche is in a fortunate position to remain flexible and respond to varying customer tastes. For example, it’s fast-tracking the development of a new gas crossover related to the Audi Q5 to replace the original Macan. Originally not part of the plan, the confirmed successor, which won't be called Macan, is expected to ride on the Premium Platform Combustion (PPC) already used by several Audi models.

Speaking of gas engines, the Cayenne and Panamera will keep their big ol’ V-8 well into the next decade. The next Boxster and Cayman will be mostly electric, but the top versions will retain a combustion engine, possibly a hybrid flat-six adapted from the 911 GTS. Whatever the future holds for the 718, it will be outlived by the 911. Zuffenhausen has repeatedly said it wants the iconic 911 to go down in history as the brand’s final combustion-engine car.

For those ready to switch to electric, the second-generation Macan and Taycan will be joined later this week by an electric Cayenne. Codenamed “K1,” a future three-row SUV will offer both ICE and EV derivatives, despite earlier plans to sell the luxobarge exclusively with electric drivetrains.

Schmollinger argued Porsche can align its product portfolio to satisfy demand:

'We don’t judge, whatever you feel like is fine for us, and we are in a position from a production point of view to react to what the market wants.'

But a notable void in the portfolio is looming. The first-generation Macan will be discontinued in mid-2026, and a replacement isn’t due until 2028. The gap will put a serious dent in volume, considering the smaller of Porsche’s two crossovers has always been near the top of the sales rankings. The ICE Macan’s absence is already being felt in Europe, where the model had to be discontinued last year for failing to meet new cybersecurity regulations.

With the VW Group’s backing, Porsche is strong enough to bounce back after grossly overestimating the rise of EVs. But the bigger picture matters, especially with the European Union dead set on abolishing sales of new combustion-engine cars from 2035. That mandate is one of the main reasons so many legacy automakers are aggressively pushing EVs. Additionally, stricter EU regulations are forcing companies to sell more electric cars to lower their fleet emissions and avoid hefty fines.

All told, automakers are caught between a rock and a hard place. EVs are still nowhere near as profitable or as popular as gas cars, yet they’re a necessity from a regulatory standpoint.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/BXYgzR/s1/2025-porsche-panamera-4s-e-hybrid-review.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 12:05:44.521071

This is particularly important for the rising number of data centers being planned that will use a gigawatt or more of power — the equivalent of a small city’s total power demand.
Meanwhile, in Georgia, major utility Georgia Power is seeking regulator permission to build gigawatts of gas-fired power capacity to meet load forecasts swollen by proposed data centers.","Surging power demand from new data centers is reaching unprecedented — and potentially unrealizable — heights.

Over the next five years, U.S. utilities expect to see new electricity demand equal to 15 times New York City’s peak load, the majority of which will come from data centers.

So finds a report released Tuesday by Grid Strategies tracking the growth in power demand for data centers being built and planned to feed tech giants’ artificial intelligence ambitions. The consultancy’s tally of utility load forecasts indicates that peak grid demand will boom to 166 gigawatts by 2030, a sixfold increase from what was forecast three years ago.

“These are just phenomenal numbers for an industry that was built over the past couple of decades to handle much lower load growth,” said John Wilson, Grid Strategies’ vice president and the report’s lead author.

Data centers make up roughly 90 gigawatts of that forecasted load growth, a reflection of the hundreds of billions of dollars that tech giants are pouring into AI, as well as smaller but still substantial investments in crypto-mining operations, enterprise cloud computing, telecommunications, and other IT services.

Back in late 2023, Grid Strategies offered an early warning about how data centers were causing power demand to spike. It has also cautioned that outsize plans for growth in key U.S. data center hot spots are threatening to exceed the physical capacity of power plants and power grids. These factors could result in higher costs for consumers and more carbon emissions as utilities plan to ramp up fossil-fuel use to serve new demand.

But Grid Strategies and others have also counseled that utilities might be exaggerating things.

For one, there’s lots of double-counting going on; data center developers often pitch the same project in multiple utility jurisdictions while searching for the best deal. For another, the gold-rush quality of the data center boom is leading developers to make speculative proposals for projects that may never materialize.

For its new report, Grid Strategies compared utility forecasts with alternative methods of projecting data center load growth, such as industry analysis of technological bottlenecks, and found that utilities may be overstating data center demand by as much as 40%.

That discrepancy indicates how utility forecasts need to better reflect underlying uncertainties, Wilson said. This is particularly important for the rising number of data centers being planned that will use a gigawatt or more of power — the equivalent of a small city’s total power demand.

“The fact that these facilities are city-sized is a huge deal,” Wilson said. ​“That has huge implications if these facilities get canceled, or they get built and don’t have long service lives.”

The rising costs of the data center boom

Utilities are using their sky-high forecasts to justify massive investments in power plants and grid infrastructure around the United States.

Those forecasts, in turn, have already driven up utility bills in some regions, including those for many of the more than 67 million people served by PJM Interconnection, the country’s biggest energy market. For PJM, future data center forecasts have driven capacity costs — the prices paid to power plants and other grid resources to meet peak grid demand — from $2.2 billion in 2023 to $14.7 billion in 2024 and to $16.1 billion in this summer’s capacity auction.

PJM customers in heavily impacted states like New Jersey are taking notice. Popular anger at rising bills helped propel Democratic gubernatorial candidates who pledged to combat increasing power costs to outsize wins in New Jersey and Virginia elections earlier this month.

Many utilities aim to meet this surging demand by building new fossil-gas-fired power plants, which could not only increase costs for customers but also slow down the transition to clean energy. Across much of the Southeast and the Midwest, in particular, utilities aim to build gigawatts’ worth of these power plants, which emit carbon dioxide as well as toxic air pollution.

In Virginia, home of the world’s largest data center hub, Dominion Energy is proposing gigawatts of new gas-fired power that, critics warn, could make it impossible for the utility to meet a state-mandated phaseout of fossil fuel use by 2045. The utility argues that the plants are needed to maintain reliability in the face of data center growth.

Meanwhile, in Georgia, major utility Georgia Power is seeking regulator permission to build gigawatts of gas-fired power capacity to meet load forecasts swollen by proposed data centers. Opponents fear that the plants will balloon already fast-rising utility bills, and this month voters overwhelmingly elected to the state’s Public Service Commission two Democratic challengers who ran on a platform of constraining unchecked utility spending.

Elsewhere, state lawmakers, regulators, and data center developers are seeking ways to accommodate growth without overwhelming the grid and utility customers.

In Texas, the country’s second-hottest data center market outside of Virginia, ​“large load” forecasts within the territory served by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) have nearly quadrupled over the past year, representing a potential doubling of its peak demand. The state legislature passed a law this spring that requires new data centers to disconnect at moments of peak grid stress, although the rules for how that will happen are still being worked out by ERCOT and state regulators.

Other states are also passing laws and instituting regulations aimed at forcing data center developers to bear the cost of new power plants and grid infrastructure. And some data center companies are promising to shift when they use power in order to relieve peak grid strains that drive much of the costs that utilities face. PJM, for its part, is considering new rules aimed at requiring new data centers to reduce their impact on the region’s capacity costs, although consumer and environmental advocates say the grid operator’s proposed plans don’t go far enough.

The Grid Strategies report also highlights that U.S. utilities and grid operators haven’t yet committed to expanding the transmission grid at the scale needed to support the growing electrification of vehicles, buildings, and industries — however the data center demand plays out. ​“Even conservative growth trajectories outpace recent years and would require substantial grid expansion to accommodate,” it notes.

Ultimately, Wilson suggested that utilities, lawmakers, and regulators will need to make sure the cost of meeting whatever demand does materialize is not shifted to everyday customers.

“We’ve got a gigantic amount of additional load over the next five years to manage from a supply-chain, planning, and construction standpoint,” he said. ​“These are questions that regulators and intervenors should be asking, and not just trusting the utilities, who say, ​‘This is the way we’ve always done it.’”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-2153309243.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=a5cfd88c1a0fca44b17f315b93191843,N,,2025-11-18 12:07:13.224742

Blair said the White House will look “as hard as possible” to see if they can issue dividend checks without Capitol Hill approval, but also expressed skepticism.

“We will look as hard as possible to see if there’s a way to do it without Congress because we’re circumspect about Congress wanting to stop [them],” Blair said at a Bloomberg Government event on Tuesday. “The law is the law. I think that the most likely outcome is, it requires an act of Congress.”

Blair also added that the checks could be a factor in another reconciliation bill. The top official acknowledged the Supreme Court’s odds of striking down President Donald Trump‘s tariffs are “50-50,” but said the president can reissue them through a different means.

Blair’s comments follow Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s remarks that the checks would “need legislation” and require congressional input.

The administration has made the argument that tariff revenue will likely outweigh any short-term pain Americans may face for increased costs.

Trump has eased some tariffs for Latin American nations for everyday household items such as coffee and bananas.

In 2022, Biden’s Bureau of Land Management (BLM) replaced a 2020 Trump Administration plan for the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska (NPR-A) with one that shuts down domestic energy production on the reserve, killing jobs, hurting Alaskan communities, and threatening our energy security.

The Biden BLM’s disastrous 2022 Integrated Activity Plan (IAP) Record of Decision (ROD) for NPR-A bars oil and gas leasing on nearly half of the reserve – an area specifically designated by Congress for energy production – leaving only 52 percent open for domestic production.

With this harmful plan, the Biden Administration put their “Green New Scam” agenda before the Alaskan people and the wellbeing of our country, ignoring the views of Alaska Native leaders in the region and imposing federal red-tape that blocks some of the state’s best resource development opportunities. The economic impacts from crushing development will only harm Alaska and hardworking Americans, cutting down on the good paying jobs and economic benefits that come with domestic production.

Today, House Republicans are bringing legislation to reverse this burdensome and damaging Biden-era plan to lock up NPR-A. It’s past time we unlock Alaska’s full potential and unleash its extensive energy resources, safeguarding jobs, shoring up energy security, and lowering costs for Americans.

Sen. Dan Sullivan’s legislation, S.J. Res. 80, reverses the Biden Bureau of Land Management's 2022 Integrated Activity Plan (IAP) Record of Decision (ROD) for the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska that blocks oil and gas leasing on nearly half of the reserve, hurting energy production and crushing job creation.

Reversing a Biden-Era RMP Amendment Crushing the Buffalo Coal Industry

Last November, the Biden Administration’s Bureau of Land Management (BLM) approved a Resource Management Plan (RMP) Amendment for the Buffalo Field Office located in Buffalo, Wyoming, which guides the management of BLM lands, including land use allocations of areas available for further coal leasing consideration and those that are not.

Staying consistent with their radical ‘Green New Scam’ policies and anti-American energy agenda, the Biden Administration’s RMP Amendment locked up all 800,000 acres of land and 4.7 million acres of mineral estate administered by the Buffalo Field Office, allocating ZERO acres of BLM administered coal as available and making 48.12 billion short tons of coal unavailable for leasing consideration.

Wyoming produces around 40 percent of the nation’s coal, and the industry supports over 4,000 jobs in rural Wyoming, $1.9 billion in labor output through 2048, and millions of dollars in state revenue used to fund public education. This radical RMP Amendment essentially ended coal leasing in the area with the BLM accepting no new coal lease applications – crushing domestic energy production, endangering access to affordable, reliable American energy, killing jobs, and harming the economy in Wyoming.

Today, House Republicans are bringing forward legislation to overturn the Biden BLM’s disastrous RMP Amendment that crushes domestic production in Wyoming, unleashing American energy development, keeping energy prices affordable and reliable, and protecting Wyoming jobs and economy.

H.J. Res. 130, introduced by Rep. Harriet Hageman, reverses the rule submitted by Biden’s Bureau of Land Management relating to “Buffalo Field Office Record of Decision and Approved Resource Management Plan Amendment” that threatens Americans’ access to affordable and reliable energy by locking up 800,000 acres of land and 4.7 million acres of mineral estate, preventing future coal leasing, and blocking access to 48 billion short-tons of coal in Wyoming.

Energy security is national security. House Republicans won’t stop fighting to unleash American energy and keep the U.S. energy dominant by cutting Biden-era energy-crushing and job-killing regulations.

Unleashing Energy in Alaska’s Coastal Plain

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act required the Secretary of the Interior to ‘‘establish and administer a competitive oil and gas program for the leasing, development, production, and transportation of oil and gas in and from the Coastal Plain’’ and mandated energy leasing in the 1002 Area of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) with the support of local North Slope communities.

However, when President Biden took office, his administration halted or cancelled all the lease sales relating to the Coastal Plain Oil and Gas Leasing Program, and in December 2024, the Biden Bureau of Land Management (BLM) issued their “Coastal Plain Oil and Gas Leasing Program Record of Decision (ROD)” – which manages the leasing program – to replace the 2020 ROD issued during President Trump’s first term.

The Coastal Plain consists of 1.5 million acres within ANWR on Alaska’s North Slope. The Biden BLM’s harmful ROD blocks energy production on 1.16 million acres of the area and makes the remaining acreage subject to strict and burdensome federal red tape, threatening Alaska’s economy, our energy security, and in turn, our national security.

We should be encouraging domestic energy production, not blocking it, so we can stop relying on foreign nations for our energy – especially since we produce energy much cleaner and safer than anywhere else in the world. House Republicans are bringing forward legislation to undo this disastrous Biden-era ROD and unleash Alaska’s natural resources to support the state’s economic interests as well as our national energy security.

Rep. Nick Begich’s legislation, H.J. Res. 131, nullifies the Biden Bureau of Land Management’s “Coastal Plain Oil and Gas Leasing Program Record of Decision (ROD)” rule that unduly restricts oil and gas leasing in the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in northeast Alaska, violating federal law and threatening U.S. energy independence.

New Market Pathways for CO₂ Storage Primacy also opens the door to CCS projects that have been unable to pursue Class VI wells due to delays.","The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has finalized Texas’ primacy for Class VI underground injection control permits, giving the Texas Railroad Commission (RRC) direct authority to regulate wells used for long-term geologic carbon sequestration. The November 7 ruling, expected to be published in the Federal Register in the coming weeks, positions Texas as the third state this year—after Arizona and West Virginia—to gain permitting authority under the Trump administration’s accelerated primacy review approach.

The decision marks a significant shift for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) developers across the state. Until now, companies seeking to build Class VI wells were required to navigate a dual permitting structure with both EPA and the RRC. Primacy consolidates those functions under a single agency, with EPA oversight remaining in place for wells on tribal lands and final concurrence required on each permit decision.

Streamlining CCS Permitting in the Nation’s Largest Energy State

Texas submitted its Class VI program revision in February 2025. EPA’s evaluation, outlined in the pre-publication rule, found that Texas’ regulatory framework, enforcement authority, and technical program met federal requirements under the Safe Drinking Water Act. The RRC’s long history regulating Class II CO₂ injection wells for enhanced oil recovery—numbering more than any other state—was a central factor in that determination.

The RRC expects to issue up to 25 Class VI permits within the first two years of primacy. This could significantly reduce the current backlog of CCS applications, many of which stalled during EPA’s historically long federal review timelines. For developers, faster permits mean timely access to federal 45Q tax credits, which remain a key incentive for large-scale carbon storage projects.

New Market Pathways for CO₂ Storage

Primacy also opens the door to CCS projects that have been unable to pursue Class VI wells due to delays. To date, most Texas carbon storage activity has occurred through Class II wells tied to oilfield operations, limiting the ability to inject CO₂ from industrial or power-sector sources at higher volumes.

With primacy in place, developers are expected to pursue larger geologic storage hubs capable of accepting CO₂ from refineries, LNG facilities, cement production, and petrochemical complexes along the Gulf Coast. Texas’ existing CO₂ pipeline network—already one of the most extensive in the country—strengthens the state’s competitive position for emerging storage markets.

Project developers will still need a “Letter of Determination” from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality verifying no conflicts with Class I wells, though EPA notes the requirement should not pose significant obstacles given the remote locations of Texas’ most suitable geologic formations.

Legal and Environmental Challenges Remain Possible

EPA received more than 7,500 public comments on the Texas proposal, including concerns from environmental organizations questioning the RRC’s enforcement track record. Similar challenges have been filed in Louisiana and West Virginia following their primacy approvals, though the Fifth Circuit dismissed the Louisiana case earlier this year for lack of standing.

Despite potential legal pushback, financial drivers continue to favor rapid CCS deployment.

But sometimes renewable energy producers have to curtail output during oversupply periods, for economic and non-economic reasons.
Economic curtailment is a growing reality for renewable energy generators, according to the Commonwealth Bank's markets research team.
CommBank also pointed out there were non-financial reasons for renewable generators to curtail output.
Mr Nugent said long-term revenue certainty for renewable energy projects had been a challenge in the back end.","When the sun is blazing and the wind is blowing, it is supposed to be the Australian electricity generators' most fruitful time of day.

But sometimes renewable energy producers have to curtail output during oversupply periods, for economic and non-economic reasons.

To incentivise households to use that abundant energy, the federal government has instituted schemes such as the three-hour free electricity period in some states and a national battery subsidy.

So what does it mean, and how is it going to affect you?

Here's what we know.

What is curtailment?

Curtailment is when energy generators put out less electricity than they have the capacity to — that is, curtailing or reining in their generation.

This can be due to economic constraints (when there is oversupply, so generators decide producing power would be uneconomic), or capacity constraints (when the transmission networks are at their limits).

Why is curtailment necessary?

Economic curtailment is a growing reality for renewable energy generators, according to the Commonwealth Bank's markets research team.

The occurrence of zero, or even negative, spot wholesale electricity prices in the National Electricity Market (NEM) meant power generation during some periods — mainly the middle of the day — was uneconomic, it said.

In the second quarter of 2025, 10.6 per cent of ""price intervals"" — the individual blocks of time in which prices are set — recorded negative or zero prices, up from 7 per cent in the same period a year earlier, CommBank found.

Utility-scale wind and solar generators curtailed about 10 per cent and 7 per cent of generation, respectively, in 2024-25, according to the research.

Dan Nugent, a trading and transition executive from Energy Australia, said that the curtailment itself did not directly increase bills, but the broader system costs of managing renewable intermittency could.

""Economic curtailment of renewable generation is an inevitable feature of transitioning to a high-renewables grid,"" he told the ABC.

""Our approach is to build flexible, long-duration storage projects like [the] Wooreen BESS (battery energy storage system) that can charge during high renewable output and dispatch when needed most, reducing both curtailment and the need for expensive peaking generation.

CommBank also pointed out there were non-financial reasons for renewable generators to curtail output.

These reasons were typically ""tied to network constraints and system strength requirements"", the bank's researchers said.

How is this linked to your electricity bill?

To prevent large amounts of solar power from going to waste, the federal government is offering up to three hours of free electricity each day to households in New South Wales, South Australia and south-east Queensland.

According to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), on average, a residential electricity bill for 2023-24 comprised:

Wholesale electricity costs — 38 per cent

Retail and other costs — 10 per cent

Retail margin — 6 per cent

Network costs — 39 per cent

Environmental costs — 7 per cent

Mr Nugent said the transmission network was one of the biggest cost contributors to Australians' energy bills, but ""behind-the-meter"" batteries could help.

Behind-the-meter refers to storage that is owned by customers, for example, households.

When such batteries were operated as a virtual power plant (VPP) — a network of distributed energy resources such as home solar panels — they could be ""treated like almost another power station in the NEM"", Mr Nugent said.

If you're enrolled in a VPP, your solar battery could help support the electricity grid by releasing stored energy during high-demand periods.

What support is available for businesses and homeowners?

The Commonwealth government has introduced the Capacity Investment Scheme (CIS) and the Cheaper Home Batteries Program (CHBP), aiming to help store more solar power.

The CIS essentially provides a long-term revenue safety net for power generators, while the CHBP helps lower costs for Australians to install more batteries.

Mr Nugent said long-term revenue certainty for renewable energy projects had been a challenge in the back end.

""Basically, you bid a revenue floor for what you require, and you also bid a ceiling.

""And so you get revenue protection up to 90 per cent of the floor up to a cap … if you outperform that year and you go above the ceiling, then you share back at 50 per cent [of the revenue] with the Commonwealth government.""

Apart from greater revenue certainty, Mr Nugent said the CIS also helped support storage projects to shift energy from oversupply periods into the evening peak.

""All the battery projects we have had CIS funding support for are all four-hour batteries … [which] will cover that peak period between say 5pm and 9pm on a daily basis,"" he said.

""The major role for the first batteries was around network support and … to help stabilise the grid.

""However, as we're getting deeper into the energy transition, longer-duration batteries will need to play a greater role in moving energy on a daily basis.""

Do we see battery uptake?

Yes.

Rooftop solar contributed 12.8 per cent of Australia's total energy generation from January to June this year, according to a Clean Energy Council (CEC) half-yearly report.

There were now 4.2 million rooftop solar installations across Australian homes and businesses, representing 26.8 gigawatts of generation capacity, the council said.

The report also noted a 191 per cent increase in battery sales compared to the same period in 2024.

""A record-breaking 85,000 battery units were sold in the first half of 2025, with a spike in the second quarter in the lead-up to the federal and WA residential home battery programs going live,"" it said.

The CEC described this as ""a significant result"", which increased nearly fivefold since 2022, when the battery sales reached 7,091.",https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/1140131d8817fade28c64e8c6542f02d?impolicy=wcms_watermark_news&cropH=2250&cropW=4000&xPos=0&yPos=207&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,N,,2025-11-18 12:06:26.410702

On completion of this work, Li-S Energy said it expects to engage with strategic and joint-venture partners to collaborate on delivery of the facility.
“This funding enables us to accelerate the critical commercial and engineering studies needed to progress advanced lithium-sulfur batteries toward large-scale production,” he said.
“By supporting Li-S Energy’s plans to scale up lithium-sulfur battery production, we are helping to fast-track the commercialisation of breakthrough battery technologies,” he said.

Brisbane-headquartered Li-S Energy is aiming to build a manufacturing plant targeting an eventual output of up to 1 GWh per year of battery cell capacity – 500 times the capacity of the company’s existing 2 MWh automated production line at Geelong in Victoria.

The company said the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) funding will enable it to undertake a manufacturing optimisation program, a feasibility study and front-end engineering design (FEED) for the proposed manufacturing plant. On completion of this work, Li-S Energy said it expects to engage with strategic and joint-venture partners to collaborate on delivery of the facility.

Li-S Energy Chief Executive Officer Lee Finniear said the new funding is a major step towards commercialising the company’s tech as it targets the rapidly growing drone, defence and electric aviation markets where weight is critical.

“This funding enables us to accelerate the critical commercial and engineering studies needed to progress advanced lithium-sulfur batteries toward large-scale production,” he said.

“It will help meet growing demand for lightweight batteries in drones, defence, aerospace and other relevant high-value commercial markets. In particular, it strengthens domestic supply chains and backs Australian innovation to deliver commercial production right here in Australia.”

Lithium-sulfur batteries have the potential to deliver up to twice the energy density of conventional lithium-ion batteries with Li-S Energy having already manufactured full size 10Ah semi-solid-state cells at its existing Geelong production facility that deliver an energy density of 498 Wh/kg on first discharge and 456 Wh/kg after formation cycling, with the cells continuing to cycle in ongoing testing.

The company said momentum is now accelerating across its operations and technology with its proprietary lithium-sulfur chemistry and manufacturing processes generating strong commercial interest.

“Over the last year we have signed commercial partnerships with a number of businesses across the drone and defence sectors,” Li-S Energy said, adding that “demonstrating the ability to scale production is a key enabler for customer adoption and offtake agreements.”

ARENA CEO Darren Miller said the project reflects the federal agency’s commitment to build sovereign domestic manufacturing capability and accelerate innovation in energy storage.

Prices now change in real-time, depending on utilization at an additional 550 Supercharging stations in California, New Jersey, New York, Florida, and Illinois.

The new approach enables the company to change pricing depending on how many EVs are actively charging at a particular station (how many stalls are occupied) and how many EVs head to that station (info from the navigation system), as well as how many EVs are forecasted to visit it soon (historical data).

It seems like a better solution compared to fixed on-peak and off-peak rates for specific periods. It’s dynamic and will function like a supply-and-demand model. The real value of DC fast charging should be reflected in pricing more accurately.

The manufacturer notes that the average price and peak prices remain unchanged. Interestingly, the highest rates are expected to be paid by fewer sessions:

“Currently the average price remains the same, peak prices are unchanged and will be paid by fewer sessions.”

Max de Zegher, Tesla’s Director of Charging North America (@MdeZegher / X), wrote that the live pricing pilot has been successful so far, delivering the desired results: a reduction in congestion during peak periods and an increase in utilization.

“A live feedback loop is better than a static one. Our live pricing pilots have been successful so far, reducing congestion while increasing utilization. We see improved load balancing, especially when there are multiple Supercharger sites nearby.”

However, as Tesla expands live pricing, it also faces some threats. Because the pricing is dynamic now, and a significant component of calculating the “right” price is the forecasted utilization in the next period, Tesla must ensure that it has a very accurate forecast. Just in case, they display a higher expected price than forecasted:

“A lot of focus is on getting the forecast as accurate as possible, so customers get the bracket they expected. We’re slightly biasing forecasts to get a cheaper price than expected, as it’s better to have a positive than negative surprise.”

The user sees the price before starting a charging session. Once accepted, the price remains fixed until the end of the session — it does not change mid-session.",https://evchargingstations.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/20251117-V4Supercharger_96-1024x576.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 09:59:54.646821

“This stuff is generating astronomical amounts of money for localities,” data center developer Tom Dakich said. “We do a bad job of bringing the transparency of those numbers, and the numbers are staggering.”

Dakich, who was involved in the Digital Crossroads data center in Hammond, spoke to the Strategic Energy Growth Task Force during an afternoon meeting at the Indiana State Museum.

The industry is also doing a “bad job” talking about the “de minimus” amount of water needed for cooling the massive facilities, he said.

He blamed opaque processes and bad information for fostering massive backlash among residents — prompting local officials to pull their support and tank projects years into development.

That’s putting some off Indiana, said Dakich, who added, “We’ve got to figure out a way to make those public officials insulated.”

Rep. Ed Soliday, R-Valparaiso, said lawmakers have already attempted.

Legislation to take control over large-scale utility infrastructure projects decisions has failed repeatedly.

“We said, ‘Let us take responsibility, and we’ll set the standards.’ And they didn’t want that. They wanted complete control,” he said.

“Why would we not have them build that?” Jaworowski asked. “Because we need that generation in the state and having a third party pay for it, rather than having our ratepayers pay for it, is just a great opportunity.”

Hybrid-electric Corollas coming to Mississippi

PLANO, Texas, (Nov. 18, 2025) – Toyota’s U.S. manufacturing presence is expanding again to meet growing demand for hybrid vehicles. As a part of Toyota’s recent commitment to invest up to $10 billion in the U.S. over the next five years, the company announces a $912 million investment and 252 new jobs across five manufacturing plants to increase hybrid capacity and bring hybrid-electric Corollas to its production lineup.

This investment in Toyota’s plants in West Virginia, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee and Missouri further builds on the company’s ongoing commitment to reinvesting profits in its U.S. operations.

“Customers are embracing Toyota’s hybrid vehicles, and our U.S. manufacturing teams are gearing up to meet that growing demand,” said Kevin Voelkel, senior vice president, manufacturing operations. “Toyota’s philosophy is to build where we sell, and by adding more American jobs and investing across our U.S. footprint, we continue to stay true to that philosophy.”

A state-by-state look at the new investments, totaling $912 million and 252 new jobs:

Toyota West Virginia: $453 million, 80 jobs

Toyota’s Buffalo, W.V. plant will add 80 jobs to increase assembly of 4-cylinder hybrid-compatible engines, sixth-generation hybrid transaxles and rear motor stators. The expansion, which will begin production in 2027, also includes new shift patterns for greater efficiency. Toyota West Virginia assembles more than one million engines, transmissions and hybrid transaxles annually and represents a $3.3 billion investment.

Toyota Kentucky: $204.4 million, 82 jobs

Toyota’s largest plant globally, located in Georgetown, Ky., will add 82 jobs and install an all-new machining line for 4-cylinder hybrid-compatible engines, lining off in 2027. The powertrain facility can assemble up to 700,000 units annually. Toyota Kentucky employs nearly 10,000 team members and represents an investment exceeding $11 billion.

Shell Spotlights Louisiana-Built Coastal Technology

“Natrx is the company it is today, thanks in large part to Shell,” said co-founder Tyler Ortego. “Shortly after our founding, Shell selected Natrx for its energy start-up accelerator, which equipped us with the tools to scale our product and develop the business relationships we needed to succeed. We are thankful to continue partnering with Shell in driving high-tech solutions to protect South Louisiana and preserve our Sportsman’s Paradise.”

Natrx’s early relationship with Shell began in 2019, when the company won the Shell GameChanger program, gaining access to mentorship and resources that helped it refine its technology and expand its commercial capabilities. The company has since grown from its initial research and development at LSU to full-scale manufacturing at its ExoForms production facility in Amelia, which now serves projects across the United States and abroad.

Statewide Recognition at Louisiana Innovation Day

That momentum was highlighted again at Louisiana Innovation Day, an LED-hosted symposium showcasing the state’s business climate and emerging innovation sector. LED unveiled a new video campaign featuring Natrx and three other Louisiana-grown companies as examples of how startups can launch, scale, and manufacture in the state. The Natrx film spotlights the company’s “Cajun Coral” adaptive reef and shoreline technology and follows the deployment of ExoForms across coastal Louisiana and international project sites.

Ortego said the company’s deep Louisiana roots have shaped its approach to addressing habitat loss and land erosion. “Our experience here helped us build solutions tailored to coastal environments while finding the partners and resources needed to scale,” he said.

Coastal Projects Across the Gulf South

Natrx and Shell have since partnered on multiple resilience and habitat-building projects throughout the Gulf South, ranging from artificial reefs that increase marine life to living shorelines that protect vulnerable coasts.

The company uses proprietary flow, wave, and wind modeling to design site-specific infrastructure solutions and measures biological performance through indicators such as species presence and changes in marsh health. Recent case studies have shown that Natrx ExoForms outperformed traditional rock breakwaters during hurricane conditions.

Expanding Impact Through Local Partnerships

The partnership expanded further in 2021 when Natrx, working with Danos Corporation, completed four shoreline-protection projects for Shell Pipeline Company LP in Louisiana marshes threatened by erosion. Danos served as the implementing contractor, manufacturing, transporting, and installing Cajun Coral units while the project team used satellite monitoring to track vegetation growth and biodiversity around the sites.

Natrx and Danos also joined Lafourche Parish Government and AIMS Group, Inc. in 2023 to celebrate the installation of a living shoreline at Lockport Bayouside Park, part of a growing number of Louisiana-based resilience projects using ExoForms.

Federal support Late last month, the Trump administration and reactor developer Westinghouse announced a “strategic partnership” to build large nuclear plants.
“If a utility wants to build nuclear, they have to be very careful in how they approach PUCs,” Arun said.","The Trump administration wants to churn dirt on a bevy of new nuclear power plants.

Electric utilities that power America have different plans.

Despite forecasts for spiking electricity use and pledges from the Department of Energy to bolster nuclear power, utilities aren’t inking contracts to build new plants with the large-scale, light-water reactors that have fueled American homes and businesses for decades.

“I wouldn’t build a nuclear plant,” Exelon CEO Calvin Butler told CNBC last week. “What I could do is lean in on combined-cycle gas turbines. What I could do is build community solar. What I could do is own battery storage.”

Duke Energy, a major utility in the Southeast, is now hedging after laying out loose plans in October to produce more than a gigawatt of new nuclear power by 2037.

“We still need to figure out what we’re going to do with cost overrun protection and how we’re going to protect our investors and our customers from overruns,” Duke CEO Harry Sideris said on an earnings call earlier this month. “Nothing going forward until we have those other items resolved.”

That hesitation is throttling Trump administration plans to reassert U.S. nuclear leadership globally — and to ensure there is enough power in the U.S. to win the artificial intelligence race with China. Experts say new builds are important drivers of industry advancement that will cut costs and boost innovation. They’re also needed to keep powering America with nuclear energy, as many of the 94 reactors in the U.S. near retirement.

“There’s not a single company out there talking about a brand new light water reactor, and that’s where the administration gets frustrated,” an energy lobbyist, who has close ties to administration and was granted anonymity to speak freely, told POLITICO’s E&E News. “The administration is a little tone deaf in understanding the trepidations from a Wall Street standpoint.”

The utility sector is grappling with a laundry list of nuclear concerns. It’s worried about high costs, hits to balance sheets and the availability of enriched uranium in the U.S. following a cut-off from Russian imports in 2028. Utility CEOs are also skeptical that the capital-intensive power will be needed if demand forecasts contract.

Nuclear construction is one of many areas of discord between the White House and utility sector.

Meanwhile, nuclear power is taking off elsewhere around the globe. China is building dozens of new large-scale reactors and dramatically cutting costs to build plants, according to recent academic research out of Johns Hopkins University, Harvard University and other institutions.

Federal support

Late last month, the Trump administration and reactor developer Westinghouse announced a “strategic partnership” to build large nuclear plants. The agreement gives the government the option to invest $80 billion into building new U.S. Westinghouse reactors in exchange for profit sharing,

While critical details remain unclear, like which utilities will purchase the power, the investment pledge is the culmination of months of rhetorical boosts for nuclear power.

“I’ve heard about the nuclear renaissance for 20 years,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright told the Foundation for American Innovation’s gala last week, according to POLITICO. “We are all in to make it happen, and with all of your help, we will make it happen.”

Meanwhile, DOE is looking for ways to help finance domestic uranium enrichment. And the administration has called forreform and expedited approvals from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which is tasked with ensuring nuclear safety.

In a statement, DOE spokesperson Ben Dietderich said the administration has “taken historic action to accelerate next-generation nuclear deployment,” pointing in part to a DOE loan to restart the Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan. That financing was initially approved by the Biden administration.

Some other new nuclear activity is afoot in the U.S. utility world. In September, the Tennessee Valley Authority, a federally owned utility, signed an agreementwith ENTRA1 Energy, a developer of small modular reactors. Meanwhile, other companies are signaling interest in restarting shuttered plants and completing work on partially-constructed ones. Last month, Santee Cooper approved a nonbinding letter of intent to finish construction at the VC Summer nuclear station in South Carolina.

High cost, high risk

The sector remains traumatized and skittish after sky-high cost overruns tied to construction of the Vogtle nuclear expansion in Georgia, completed in 2024 at roughly double the anticipated price tag. In 2017, South Carolina’s Santee Cooper and a project partner also abandoned two Westinghouse reactors at VC Summer after sinking $9 billion into the project.

“They don’t want to get caught the way that the Vogtle utilities and developers were,” said Advait Arun, senior associate for capital markets at the Center for Public Enterprise. “They’re weighing the odds.”

The Vogtle cost overruns sent Westinghouse into bankruptcy and created a public relations nightmare for Southern Co., the parent company of Georgia Power, which purchases power from Vogtle.

Dale Klein, a former NRC chair, said that utilities remain cautious.

“Utilities, by nature, are gonna be conservative, and they’ll do what’s cheap, reliable, and quick,” Klein said. “There are a lot of memoranda of understanding that are being signed today, and MOUs are only worth the paper they’re written on. It just means they’re gonna agree to work and think about things.”

He said the decision to contract a new nuclear plant could deliver a blow to the stock price of the company.

“If a publicly traded utility was to announce that they’re going to build a new large, conventional nuclear reactor, it’s very likely that their stock price would drop because Wall Street would be worried about the risk,” Klein said.

A nuclear fiasco akin to Vogtle could upend the balance sheet for a small or moderate-sized utility, experts said.

Overruns didn’t upend Southern Co.’s balance sheet because the utility was able to pass upfront costs onto ratepayers. Now, other states are aiming to get laws on the books, known as construction work-in-progress rules, that allow their utilities to do the same. A bill in North Carolina attempts to do that. A recently passed bill in Missouri allows utilities to pass on costs, but only for new gas projects.

“[Utilities] have to consider what’s right for the ratepayers, and that’s going to be the first big question,” said Rowen Price, a policy adviser at the center-left think tank Third Way.

But with electricity prices rising nationwide, the public utility commissioners that regulate the utility sector could thwart plans for rate hikes.

“If a utility wants to build nuclear, they have to be very careful in how they approach PUCs,” Arun said. “In light of broader concerns about affordability, we shouldn’t assume approval of rate hikes as granted, at least not to the degree that they could finance nuclear.”

Critics of nuclear power are relishing the inaction among utilities.

“We’ve seen these so-called nuclear renaissance efforts declared in the past,” said Kevin Kamps, radioactive waste watchdog at the nonprofit Beyond Nuclear. “It’s such a horrendous recent experience, no wonder the utilities aren’t gung-ho to jump in if any of their own skin is in the game.”

Demand spike uncertainty

The United States faces an electricity demand surge unseen in a generation. But some experts think the forecasts may be overblown. Data center developers are logging potential projects in multiple locations across the country, and that’s added uncertainty to the infrastructure build-out. Moreover, data centers could become more efficient and the pace of the tech industry could slow.

Experts compare the current demand scenario with the dot-com era, when dramatic electricity demand spikes were projected but never materialized.

“If there is a sharp contraction in demand, the projects that will go first are the largest capital investments with the least flexibility value in the future,” Arun said. “You’re going to see a lot more investment in cheaper gas, solar and storage and batteries, and wind — these kinds of technologies.”

Moreover, the highest confidence for skyrocketing power demand forecasts is in the next few years.

“When you look at that demand that you have to meet right now, that means natural gas is about your only choice for 24/7 operation,” Klein said. “They’re building these data centers now. They need electricity now. Nuclear takes longer.”

Still, Klein was hopeful that utilities will invest in nuclear projects today to meet long-term forecasts, which still predict continued growth. That could help provide investment confidence.

“If the data centers come in with money up front and say, ‘I will guarantee I’m gonna buy this electricity for the long term, and I’m willing to be risk-sharing,’ then I think you’ll see some plants being built,” Klein continued.

Edison Electric Institute, the main lobbying group for for-profit utilities, says it supports nuclear.

“Nuclear energy is essential to delivering as many electrons to the grid and providing more reliable energy to the American people as affordability as possible,” EEI CEO Drew Maloney said in a statement. “We welcome the Trump administration’s focus on revitalizing this sector and look forward to working together to power America’s future.”

But to boost nuclear energy, utilities will need to move beyond rhetoric. Experts say the Trump administration’s $80 billion pledge is merely pomp until utilities get involved.

“It’s all kind of holographic until someone actually buys a reactor,” said the energy lobbyist granted anonymity to speak freely. “Who’s going to buy the reactor? Until your acme utility actually signs a contract, it’s irrelevant.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/65/bc/98b95b094bf5a3450963c85e1a52/nuclear-plant-georgia-76660.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 07:58:56.704187

Data center power shortage solutions: behind-the-meter long-duration

Hyperscale and AI campuses face power capacity constraints, interconnection delays, and price spikes. As one practical and safe solution, behind-the-meter long-duration energy storage (LDES) using vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFB) adds 8–12+ hour on-site discharge, improving price capture and resiliency with no thermal-runaway risk. Deployed as temporary power, VRFBs can support phased commissioning before the point of interconnection - subject to local permitting - keeping schedules on track while grid upgrades catch up.

On the grid side, according to PJM’s 2025 Long-Term Load Forecast Report, long-term load outlooks point to higher peaks and a wide dispersion in zone growth rates about 0.1–6.0% 10-year CAGR (median of 1.6%), which complicates planning and interconnection, raising schedule and cost risk.

Regulatory posture is also evolving. For example, Texas Senate Bill 6 (SB6) (2025) formalizes planning/interconnection/operations frameworks for large electrical loads and co-located generation while characterizing Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) curtailment/disconnection authority as limited and conditional. In practice, operators should track state-level rules and utility guidance, and design on-campus, long-duration flexibility using behind-the-meter (BTM) storage to hedge outages, price shocks, and interconnection delays across development and ramp-up.

◇ BTM long-duration storage that rides through outages and shapes imports

Placing storage behind the meter creates a practical resilience layer on campus:

1. Ride through grid events to keep critical loads online.

2. Shape imported power to mitigate peaks and price volatility.

3. Smooth on-site PV/wind and respond more flexibly to utility requests.

NREL defines BTM storage as assets connected on the customer side of the meter, and it increasingly sits at the center of reliability and cost control for buildings and campuses.

Why VRFB for BTM? A VRFB stores energy in electrolyte tanks and provides power via cell stacks, so you can extend energy hours by adding tanks as rack density and AI clusters grow—pushing required discharge from 4 hours toward 8–12+ hours. With a non-flammable, water-based electrolyte and no thermal-runaway mechanism, VRFBs align well with urban campus Environment, Health, and Safety (EHS) requirements and permitting standards. In effect, one on-site system reduces price, reliability, and schedule risk at the same time.

◇ Safety & compliance: non-flammable VRFB, UL 1973 / UL 9540A ready

In San Diego, Sumitomo Electric’s SDG&E project achieved the first U.S. UL 1973 certification for a flow-battery cell stack (2017), entered CAISO market operations (2018), and later demonstrated a zero-emissions microgrid with black-start and seamless islanding. These field results translate directly to hyperscale campuses: non-flammable chemistry that eases siting and insurance reviews, daily full-cycle durability for high-duty operation, and scalable energy hours via tank expansion to meet 8–12+ hour windows (evening peaks, outage coverage). Continuous U.S. operation, CAISO participation, and microgrid experience together help lower operational risk after deployment.

If Mikie Sherrill can figure out how to get generation online quickly in New Jersey, she’ll have accomplished something more impressive than a rate freeze.
That wouldn’t solve the problem forever, though, Silverman told me.
“I think that will be a really significant piece.” Then there’s the hard way — slashing utilities’ regulated rates of return.
But you establish a very contentious relationship with the utilities,” Silverman told me.","So how do you freeze electricity rates, exactly? That’s the question soon to be facing New Jersey Governor-elect Mikie Sherrill, who achieved a resounding victory in this November’s gubernatorial election in part due to her promise to declare a state of emergency and stop New Jersey’s high and rising electricity rates from going up any further.

The answer is that it can be done the easy way, or it can be done the hard way.

What will most likely happen, Abraham Silverman, a Johns Hopkins University scholar who previously served as the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities’ general counsel, told me, is that New Jersey’s four major electric utilities will work with the governor to deliver on her promise, finding ways to shave off spending and show some forbearance.

Indeed, “We stand ready to work with the incoming administration to do our part to keep rates as low as possible in the short term and work on longer-term solutions to add supply,” Ralph LaRossa, the chief executive of PSE&G, one of the major utilities in New Jersey, told analysts on an earnings call held the day before the election.

PSE&G’s retail bills rose 36% this past summer, according to the investment bank Jefferies. As for what working with the administration might look like, “We expect management to offer rate concessions,” Jefferies analyst Paul Zimbrado wrote in a note to clients in the days following the election, meaning essentially that the utility would choose to eat some higher costs. PSE&G might also get “creative,” which could mean things like “extensions of asset recoverable lives, regulatory item amortization acceleration, and other approaches to deliver customer bill savings in the near-term,” i.e. deferring or spreading out costs to minimize their immediate impact. “These would be cash flow negative but [PSE&G] has the cushion to absorb it,” Zimbrado wrote.

In return, Silverman told me that the New Jersey utilities “have a wish list of things they want from the administration and from the legislature,” including new nuclear plants, owning generation, and investing in energy storage. “I think that they are probably incented to work with the new administration to come up with that list of items that they think they can accomplish again without sacrificing reliability.”

Well before the election, in a statement issued in August responding to Sherrill’s energy platform, PSE&G hinted toward a path forward in its dealings with the state, noting that it isn’t allowed to build or own power generation and arguing that this deregulatory step “precluded all New Jersey electric companies from developing or offering new sources of power supply to meet rising demand and reduce prices.” Of course, the failure to get new supply online has bedeviled regulators and policymakers throughout the PJM Interconnection, of which New Jersey is a part. If Mikie Sherrill can figure out how to get generation online quickly in New Jersey, she’ll have accomplished something more impressive than a rate freeze.

As for ways to accomplish the governor-elect’s explicit goal of keeping price increases at zero, Silverman suggested that large-scale investments could be paid off on a longer timeline, which would reduce returns for utilities. Other investments could be deferred for at least a few years in order to push out beyond the current “bubble” of high costs due to inflation. That wouldn’t solve the problem forever, though, Silverman told me. It could simply mean “seeing lower costs today, but higher costs in the future,” he said.

New Jersey will also likely have to play a role in deliberations happening in front of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission about interconnecting large loads — i.e. data centers — a major driver of costs throughout PJM and within New Jersey specifically. Rules that force data centers to “pay their own way” for transmission costs associated with getting on the grid could relieve some of the New Jersey price crunch, Silverman told me. “I think that will be a really significant piece.”

Then there’s the hard way — slashing utilities’ regulated rates of return.

In a report prepared for the Natural Resources Defence Council and Evergreen Collective and released after the election, Synapse Economics considered reducing utilities’ regulated return on equity, the income they’re allowed to generate on their investments in the grid, from its current level of 9.6% as one of four major levers to bring down prices. A two percentage point reduction in the return on equity, the group found, would reduce annual bills by $40 in 2026.

Going after the return on equity would be a more difficult, more contentious path than working cooperatively on deferring costs and increasing generation, Silverman told me. If voluntary and cooperative solutions aren’t enough to stop rate increases, however, Sherrill might choose to take it anyway. “You could come in and immediately cut that rate of return, and that would absolutely put downward pressure on rates in the short run. But you establish a very contentious relationship with the utilities,” Silverman told me.

Silverman pointed to Connecticut, where regulators and utilities developed a hostile relationship in recent years, resulting in the state’s Public Utilities Regulatory Authority chair, Marissa Gillett, stepping down last month. Gillett had served on PURA since 2019, and had tried to adopt “performance-based ratemaking,” where utility payouts wouldn’t be solely determined by their investment level, but also by trying to meet public policy goals like energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Connecticut utilities said these rules would make attracting capital to invest in the grid more difficult. Gillett’s tenure was also marred by lawsuits from the state’s utilities over accusations of “bias” against them in the ratemaking process. At the same time, environmental and consumer groups hailed her approach.

Playing to Win

Jordan Schneider: Jake Sullivan, Biden’s former National Security Advisor, currently a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School, and my near peer in podcasting. Jake, welcome to ChinaTalk.

Jake Sullivan: Thank you for having me. Now I have a whole different vantage point on being a guest on a podcast, so I’ll spend my time silently judging you.

Jordan Schneider: Great, we’ll have an impromptu masterclass.

You’re calling your new show The Long Game. What are your reflections on how crises interact with the goal of maximizing national power, or however you want to define the long game?

Jake Sullivan: Part of the reason we’re calling it The Long Game is that it’s incredibly important for us to lift our heads up and out of the smoke of immediate crises and ask, how do we put the US on the strongest strategic footing going forward? That really is the ultimate essence of the long game — how do we marshal and husband the sources of American power in service of our national security, our prosperity, and our values? That’s the ethos behind The Long Game.

Now, to your question about the interaction between crises and the long game — it takes an enormous amount of discipline, especially in my time in the seat when we were dealing with a lot of crises and a lot of different types of incoming, to say we’re going to set aside the time, the effort, the resources, and the top-level attention to actually focus on the long game. I’m actually quite proud that through Ukraine, the Middle East, Afghanistan, Chinese balloons, and lots of other stuff, we set aside the time to really invest in our alliances, invest in our industrial base, and invest in a set of technology policies that advanced America’s capabilities and helped protect those capabilities from being used against us.

That requires discipline — a huge amount of discipline — and I tried to bring that discipline with me to work every day. I was also lucky to have a lot of people who were assigned to the long-game things and not just the crises, who had no trouble banging on my door and saying, “Jake, don’t forget we have to be working on this issue,” whether it was chip controls or infrastructure projects in Africa or what have you. Having that kind of team around you — people who keep you honest and say we’re not going to let you just get swallowed by the inbox — that was very important as well.

Jordan Schneider: Is there a design fix around this? Should there be two NSAs — the firefighter and the long-term person? Why does this need to be one job?

Jake Sullivan: That’s a great question. Maybe it’s right that if you think about the close advisors to the President, there shouldn’t be any reason you couldn’t have two people essentially dividing the job. My overall reaction is that it’s probably a process fix better done with other senior people who are devoted to specific crises, not just someone who’s like, “I come in and handle all crises.”

A National Security Advisor should actually have both the dispensation and the instinct to say, “I’m just not going to spend a lot of time on this particular set of issues. I’m going to have the Principal Deputy do that, or an envoy do that, or someone else in government do that, because I need to be allocating more of my time to the longer-term things.” That’s probably a better way to do it than formally dividing the role into two.

One thing I reflect on from my time in government is, should I have just more consciously and systematically said, “This is something I’m putting on someone else’s plate, and I will check in on it every now and again, but it’s not going to be something I’m responsible for”?

Jordan Schneider: What were the things that you decided you needed to own and drive personally very aggressively, and why did you make those calls?

Jake Sullivan: First, I felt I was unusual as a National Security Advisor in that I thought I had to be at the table as an advocate, a designer, and to a certain extent an implementer of domestic industrial policy. I thought it was important that we have the national security perspective on that and that we’d be pushing that forward on chips, on clean energy, on infrastructure. That was one thing that I put a lot of effort into, particularly in the first two years.

Second, I thought the intersection of technology and national security was going to be defining. We created from whole cloth a new directorate on Technology and National Security, and I saw it as my responsibility to stay on top of that set of issues — yes, semiconductor export controls, but also other areas, such as biotech, quantum, and as I mentioned before, the clean energy transition.

Third, I believed from the beginning that a defining feature of modern geopolitics is the competition between the US and China. I thought it was my responsibility to play a central role in the design and execution of our China strategy and in the management of the US-China relationship.

Those were areas that I felt, regardless of what else was going on anywhere else in the world, I had to be focused on. Tied to all of those — industrial policy, technology policy, US-China — were allies. That meant husbanding and stewarding our relationships with core allies: the G7 plus India, Korea, and Australia. I put a lot of thought, energy, and effort into trying to elevate those relationships so that they were in the strongest possible state.

Jordan Schneider: That is a lot of stuff.

Jake Sullivan: Yes. I didn’t even mention the war in Ukraine. Or the multiple overlapping crises in the Middle East, or the drawdown from Afghanistan. There’s a lot going on. But the things I just named — they’re also interconnected. They’re not just different piles of work. At our best moments, they were a coherent strategy that we were trying to drive.

Jordan Schneider: You were one person both pushing the long-term stuff and being the crisis manager — what are the upsides to having that all be on your shoulders?

Jake Sullivan: First of all, if you just take it from the top, the President of the United States has to do everything. There is no division of that job into multiple different units. At some point as you go up any institution, any organization, you get to a CEO or a cabinet secretary or a President or a National Security Advisor. The question is, can you have a multi-headed monster at the top of the National Security Council enterprise? That’s difficult because you’re trying to execute and run a process that allocates time, energy, resources, priority, and then unity of vision and coherence of execution across everything. At the end of the day, you need a single point of accountability for that. That’s why it has to be basically in the job of the National Security Advisor.

But I also believe that theories of delegation and relative levels of personal engagement on different issues have to be an important part of how someone in that role thinks about what they’re doing day to day.

On Age, Experience, and Getting Ground Down

Jordan Schneider: What do you think the pluses and minuses were of being the second-youngest National Security Advisor when you started the job?

Jake Sullivan: It’s interesting — I’ve thought a fair amount about this, and it may strike some of your listeners as surprising. I was 44 years old when I took the job. That’s only a couple years younger than Kissinger was when he took the job.

Jordan Schneider: He was 45 and a half. ChatGPT made us a chart. Not sponsored, by the way. McGeorge Bundy was 41, which is insane. Condi was 46. You’re not an outlier on the young side. The mean is 53.

Jake Sullivan: There are a number of National Security Advisors around my age. When I took the job, I felt very young in a way because you tend to think of the black-and-white photographs of people with gray hair. But that’s a solid list of folks in their mid-to-late 40s entering this job — in some cases not with a lot of government experience at all coming before them, in other cases, like Condi, with quite a substantial amount of government experience.

Pluses of being on the younger side include energy, stamina, the capacity to really dig in and do the job full bore, full scale, 24/7. Being willing to push the envelope and be creative and dynamic and say we’re going to do things a different way, we’re going to have a theory of the case and try to execute against it — that youthful vision, energy, and creativity matters. That’s not just the single person acting as National Security Advisor — it’s also the team they build and the dynamic they build.

In my case, I felt I was able to build a very flat structure where everyone could come in, challenge, question, raise ideas, and feel like they had a voice. There wasn’t some oracle up top with hierarchy. That made for a much better — well, first of all, it was a better working environment, just more fun to work in that way. But I also think it allowed us to develop more interesting, more creative, more dynamic strategies in critical areas.

As for downsides… having done this job for four years. I understand deeply, to my bones, the value of experience — both positive experience and hard-won experience. There’s no substitute for it. There’s actually no substitute for experience as National Security Advisor. It is a truly unique type of seat to sit in that in some ways nothing can really actually prepare you for.

Jordan Schneider: More on that then. What was year-four Jake Sullivan able to do that year-one Jake Sullivan couldn’t?

Jake Sullivan: Actually, the most interesting part about experience is that to essentially metabolize experience, you need distance. Ask me in a year and I’ll give you an answer to the question. I’m being a bit glib, but what I mean is it’s less that in year two I was suddenly able to do things I couldn’t do in year one. It’s more the accumulation of that experience and then stepping away and being able to say, “Okay, I now have lessons learned — things that worked well, things that didn’t work well.” As this conversation goes on, I’ll point out some of those, I assume.

Sometimes I think that actually the right way for someone to do a job like this is to come in for two years, leave for six months, and then come back for 18 months — or in for 18, out for a year, back. I don’t know, whatever it adds up to. Leaving even for a little while just gives you an angle on what you were doing in the trenches that you just don’t have when you’re sitting in those trenches. That’s an interesting model for how to think about this going forward: you serve for a while, then you step away for a little while, then you come back and say, “Okay, now I’ve actually had the chance to metabolize that experience.” But anyway, that’s an idle thought for others to consider down the road.

Jordan Schneider: On what dimensions do you feel like experience gets accrued?

Jake Sullivan: The first dimension is living through a crisis, and actually having to stare square in the face the hard trade-offs and the imperfect choices, the lack of clear information, the need to form assumptions in the shadow of uncertainty. You can read all about that, but until you actually have to live through it, you’re not going to fully understand what both the opportunities and limitations are. That’s one.

Second is converting vision into action. How do you actually turn the idea of an industrial strategy into results? You’ve got to go through the thick and thin of that and make progress, but also come up short, to really be able to expose and understand what the obstacles are, what the modes of operating are, and how we could have done things differently — faster, more ambitiously, more creatively. Those are a couple of examples of where having to actually do something is what teaches you what works, what doesn’t, and how to be most effective.

Jordan Schneider: What about on the management side?

Jake Sullivan: On the management side, it comes down to a combination of how do you get the best out of people. Experience can come both ways, to be honest with you. One thing that I observed over the course of my time in government is that you get ground down. Your kindness, your patience, your sense of joie de vivre just get ground down. You become more impatient. Government is hard, so you become harder. I had to constantly fight against that. That’s an asterisk, a proviso — set that aside. That’s how too much experience, too much time in the trenches can actually degrade you rather than enhance you.

But how you actually get the most out of a team, how you run a process, what works and doesn’t work with respect to trying to surface and crystallize options for the President, how to make the government as a whole all pull in the same direction — these are things that require trial and error. It’s a very human exercise. Any particular group of people is going to have its own psychology, its own operating capacity. You can take experience from one administration and it won’t map neatly onto another. But there are some broader lessons that you can learn from it.

Jordan Schneider: In 20th-century American history, we have a bit of a pendulum. On one side, we have FDR and Trump — presidents just winging it. On the other side, we have the reactions to that — Truman being like, “Man, this FDR guy was crazy, we need to create the NSC,” or the Biden administration saying, “This Trump guy was crazy, we need to bring in a Yale Law School person to organize things.” After doing this job, how do you see the trade-offs of both models?

Jake Sullivan: This is going to maybe be true to brand, but I actually think that the right answer is to try to land in the middle of that pendulum. What I mean by that is — rigorous, fair, honest process is really important to the long-term strength of the United States and to the discipline of strategy on the big picture. But I also believe that a President and a National Security Advisor need a theory of what’s really important, and they need to get after it.

I had two people that I really looked at to try to approximate — not emulate, because I couldn’t live up to these two guys — but approximate. They were Brent Scowcroft and Zbigniew Brzezinski. Scowcroft for process and for being an honest broker and for not coming in and just calling the shots, but rather teeing up the debates of principles to the President. Brzezinski, because he had a theory of geopolitics and a worldview that helped shape and drive decision-making, even as he dealt with a bunch of crises on the edges and margins of that. A blend of those two strategies is the best way to pursue statecraft.

Breakneck Industrial Policy

Jordan Schneider: Are there dimensions on which you wish you’d had more freedom of maneuver? What felt the most constraining?

Jake Sullivan: You’ve had Dan Wang on your podcast — I thought his book Breakneck was just incredibly thought-provoking and interesting. His overall thesis is that America is run by lawyers — of which I am one — while China is run by engineers. There’s a truth to that. Democratic administrations are even more run by lawyers.

It would have been great to have more freedom of maneuver to actually just build at speed and scale than we were able to accomplish, because we had every conceivable obstacle to being able to do that — from the defense industrial base to infrastructure to building a semiconductor fab in Arizona. That would be one area where more freedom of maneuver, more capacity to move fast, would have helped.

Two: The US is funny. We’re the richest country on the planet, with deep and liquid capital markets and a massive federal budget, and yet our ability to mobilize capital in an intentional way to serve national security ends, both domestically and globally, is wanting.

I would have loved more freedom of maneuver to be able to offer a value proposition to the countries of the Global South for building infrastructure and competing with the Belt and Road Initiative. It was hard to even get nickels and dimes to be able to do that.

That was maddening because for pennies on the dollar, we could have competed more effectively and can to this day compete more effectively. We’re not doing it because we can’t get that money.

Jordan Schneider: In that vein, what homework would you give researchers, future administrations, and anyone listening?

Jake Sullivan: We really need a deep and rigorous study of what the objectives of industrial policy are, what the limits of industrial policy should be, what tools work and don’t work, and then once it’s being applied, what are the obstacles to actually executing in a way that delivers results on a reasonable timeframe. To the extent those obstacles need to be adjusted, how do we adjust them?

That entire chain of questions — people are looking at some of it. Some of my former colleagues, like

and , who were central to the CHIPS Act effort, are really doing a deep study of some of this today [now on substack at ]. But there is not a body of work on this, in part because industrial policy was basically considered unacceptable to work on. We’ve got to bring it front and center, and not just with the core economics profession — that’s got to be a dialogue between national security professionals and economists coming up with a range of answers to those questions that are rooted in empirics and evidence and rigorous study.

I would ask anyone out there who’s thinking about contributing to the national security literature of the future — this, to me, is a set of questions for which we need better answers than we have. Those answers will be in large measure defining of whether we’re able to pursue an effective strategy.

What If’s on Rare Earths and US-China Escalation

Jordan Schneider: The CHIPS Act is a long-game play, but there is a world in which you implemented the October 7th controls and China decided to play the rare earths card early. If you had woken up in that world, what would you have done?

Jake Sullivan: First of all, we wouldn’t wake up the next day and think about what to do, because we thought about that before we did the controls. We thought about retaliation risk. We thought about how to structure a strategy to protect our most advanced technology without getting on an escalation ladder that could end in harm to us or a downward spiral, or as we’ve just seen recently, the need for us to basically blink and back down.

We executed the controls in a way consistent with this theory of “small yard, high fence,” precisely to avoid the massive counterreaction that we have seen once President Trump decided to slap on 145% tariffs. That was a credible and sensible strategy.

Now, it’s totally fair to ask — and this gets to the point of hard-won experience — we knew that rare earths were a supply chain vulnerability for the United States. We knew that China was weaponizing it. We were explicit about that, open about that. We took steps on it. I could send you a note with a whole list of things that would all look like perfectly credible steps one would take to try to reduce that supply chain vulnerability. And yet it obviously didn’t end that vulnerability or even really, truly dramatically reduce it. Why?

I’ve reflected on this question, and there are a few reasons. One reason is that it is a new set of muscles for the government to intervene in markets where the markets have failed or where a competitor like China has taken advantage of those markets to dominate supply. We were trying to build that muscle.

Second, it’s a dynamic game. We made investments in US firms, we also made investments in allies, and China was counterreacting by cratering the price or driving a particular processing plant out of business. We hadn’t yet fully gotten up to speed in terms of that reaction-counterreaction.

The thing that concerns me right now is the Trump administration is taking good steps on this and they’re obviously motivated, but it’s still linear from where we were. We need to go really nonlinear. We need a much more aggressive strategy, in my view.

If I’d woken up the next day after the imposition of the semiconductor export controls and they’d played the massive rare earth card, I would have said drop everything — we need to solve this within the shortest possible span of time and essentially have Operation Warp Speed to get it done.

That is what the Trump administration should do. They’re moving in that direction, but now is the moment for more alacrity. I say that as someone recognizing — not enough alacrity in our administration, in the end, not enough alacrity. I’m worried that that remains the case today.

Jordan Schneider: Zooming back, we have two countries that are competing, which are deeply economically intertwined. Say you solve rare earths — it seems to me that insofar as the two countries have an enormous amount of economic interaction with each other, there will still be ways for either country to squeeze and cause the other one pain, even if it’s not commercial. We saw Volt Typhoon — “What the hell are you doing in our water treatment plants?” I’m sure you told them to knock it off and they didn’t.

It’s a game worth playing, but what does the incremental resiliency-building help the US when it comes to these negotiations? To use a wrestling metaphor — if you’re winning points in the round, but your opponent could still pin you if they really felt like they needed to.

Jake Sullivan: As far as homework — let’s fully map the vulnerabilities as far as we can see them. Let’s ask where they are. Let’s test this hypothesis you put forward that there is simply no end to interdependence and that there will be some fundamental vulnerability that can be exploited by China or, for that matter, by the United States. That is worth a deep dive, not just all of us talking back and forth about it.

I have three answers to this question.

There are different forms of vulnerability. Some act very fast, and the pain can be applied asymmetrically, powerfully, and swiftly. Some act much more slowly and give you time to adjust, or they act in a way that harms the country imposing that action, so there’s some degree of deterrence. That’s one answer — let’s not just have a list of all the interdependencies, but we need to isolate the examples that are like rare earths. How many of those are there actually?

I would prefer to have fewer vulnerabilities rather than more. If I can take some bullets out of your gun, could I still end up dead? Maybe. But if you gave me the choice between you having a full magazine and less than a full magazine, I would say let’s make investments to do that.

This is really important — the more a country shows it has the muscle to be able to adapt and adjust if another country tries to weaponize interdependence, the more of a broader-based deterrent effect it ends up having. Having the wherewithal to relatively rapidly identify and then close a gap, even if you know there are other gaps out there, has a knock-on effect on those other gaps too. For all those reasons, we should still have a resilience strategy, though I do acknowledge that this is a very legitimate question.

Part of the answer to it has to come down to a cost-benefit analysis of trying to deal with this resilience. In the rare earths case, the cost-benefit analysis seems to be pretty straightforward. This is not a massive market. It doesn’t require us to move heaven and earth to resolve the vulnerability. It requires some determined, concerted action, and we should take it.

On Yards and Fences 固若金汤

Jordan Schneider: The closest thing we got to a Sullivan Doctrine was given in September 2022 — “Given the foundational nature of certain technologies, we must maintain as large of a lead as possible.” There’s the maximalist version of that, where everything gets cut off, you’re Stuxnet-ing private companies. Then there’s the “small yard, high fence” version of Biden vintage, where every day you put out new export controls, and the next day we’re recording an emergency podcast talking about all the loopholes. I’m curious about your reflections on what the calculus was and what was constraining it. Was it domestic stuff? Was it political economy? Was it worries about retaliation? How did the level end up getting set?

Jake Sullivan: One element is retaliation risk. We talked that through, right? If you just say to China, “We’re essentially cutting you off altogether,” then you’re going to induce a really dramatic reaction. That’s what happened when we fired a bazooka of 145% tariffs — they fired a bazooka back.

A second element is trying to actually have some discipline about a threshold above which you have national security concerns and below which you’re just talking about broad-based commercial or consumer applications. We wanted to have the American idea that we’re not in favor of a total technology blockade. We are just in favor of focusing on those elements of technology that have genuine national security and strategic implications for us.

A third aspect is what you said about political economy — you’re trying to bring allies along, you’re trying to bring your private sector along, you’re trying to organize a government that has very different views on this.

If you and I sat down for an hour and went through ‘22, ‘23, and ‘24 — do I think we got all the calibrations right, all the levels? Of course not. First of all, in ‘22, they knocked out the interconnect and had the H100, and we had to update the controls in part because that interconnect speed criteria didn’t make sense. We were learning as we went — the stockpiling of some of the manufacturing equipment, those timelines we could walk through. But we were executing a novel strategy, trying to make sure that we were nurturing and sustaining our advantages, protecting our most advanced technologies, while at the same time dealing with this other set of considerations.

I had breakfast with a guy I respect a huge amount in the technology field who was basically like, “My only objection to ‘small yard, high fence’ is that it should be ‘big yard, high fence.’” He had an argument — we should control legacy chips, control it all. I actually think the experience of this year and how things have played out compared with the experience of the last three years is a good argument for “small yard, high fence” — for a particular style and strategy of a pretty aggressive policy that is conducted with a degree of care and precision. That was a more sustainable policy for the United States over the longer term than just letting it rip. Now, it’s hard to say for sure that that’s right. There’s no algorithm for this, but that was the judgment that we reached, and that’s why we proceeded the way that we did.

The last thing I would raise on this is, having watched President Trump do what he has done with our allies, was the right answer just FDPR — the Foreign Direct Product Rule — from the start? Basically, don’t negotiate with our allies over coordinated semiconductor manufacturing equipment controls. Just tell them they’ve got American content, you’re not selling, done. I think about that sometimes. That comes down to a question of what are the longer-term costs of treating your friends that way? I believe that there are genuine longer-term costs for that that are real and strategic and meaningful. But I can’t prove that. That’s something we’re going to have to watch over time because now we’re running a real lab experiment.

Jordan Schneider: All right, let’s talk about China. There was kind of a big yard with FDPR. Should we have been more aggressive with FDPR, for example, to really put maximal pressure on Huawei? Do you think China would have freaked out?

Jake Sullivan: The yard could have been smaller than it is, I guess. Here’s what I would say about some of these arguments — like, if only you do this extra thing on Huawei, then that happens. It reminds me of the “real socialism has never been tried” argument. Look, it’s possible you’re right — just one more crushing sanction or export control.

By the way, I’m being glib because you may be right. But the question that one has to grapple with is some of the assumptions that underpinned the Huawei controls that were put in place in the Trump administration and the statements about what would happen as a result of those controls — not the next, better version later down the line — didn’t quite bear out. We have to grapple with that, too. You may be right that just taking more steps in the Biden administration could have made all the difference.

Jordan Schneider: I identified the biggest “what if” is FDPR on equipment earlier, because the big chart is the one where SME exports double and double again and double again. It’s going to keep doubling. That seems to me to be the big fork in the road.

Jake Sullivan: It’s a big question, and I’m not sure what the right answer is. We had a thesis with respect to our allies — you work with them rather than coerce them. That obviously meant China got access to more manufacturing equipment than if we had just coerced them. But in a net assessment of the overall health, vitality, and strength of those relationships and how they would play out in — to coin a phrase — the long game, that’s a big question.

President Trump is testing that question because he’s basically saying, “I don’t buy it. I can go punish all these people as much as I like, and they’re just going to have to keep being friends because they have no other choice.” He seems to think that’ll just be how it is. I happen to think what’s more likely is you get a group of countries that were coming along with us to de-risk from China, who now are sitting there thinking, “I’ve got to do what I’ve got to do today, but over time, I need to de-risk from the United States.” In the end, that is not going to be a winning strategy.

These are the kinds of calls that you have to make in the shadow of uncertainty. I will say we didn’t have knockdown, drag-out fights about FDPR. There was a general sense that we should try to negotiate this with our allies rather than just club them over the head. There are also other ways to get at this challenge than FDPR — like timelines on implementation and how companies went about allowing the stockpiling despite government agreements and so forth. That’s for another time, maybe over a drink.

Taiwan, Pelosi and the Risk of Accidental War

Jordan Schneider: You were present at the beginning of the Xi era. What do you believe about him that’s not the consensus?

Jake Sullivan: He is more improvisational than the theory that he’s just set out a coherent strategy that they are just going to execute. He’s basically like any other leader of any other big, unruly country, and he’s got to make a lot of stuff up as he goes along.

Jordan Schneider: Accidental conflict is something Americans worry about. I’m personally skeptical that if two countries really don’t want to fight, they can trip into a war neither side really wants. Am I wrong here? Is this something I should be more scared of?

Jake Sullivan: It’s such a fair question. It’s almost like a shibboleth — the risk of mistake, miscalculation, escalation. Ships bumping into each other in the South China Sea, and all of a sudden, you’re in World War III. I share a degree of your skepticism. There are restraining factors that can allow disengagement and de-escalation.

But let me give you a hypothetical scenario, and you tell me if it worries you. As you know, the PRC is pressing closer and closer to the island of Taiwan in the air and on the sea, bumping up against fewer and fewer nautical miles offshore, right? They’re doing that with manned aircraft, they’re doing it with ships, they’re doing it with drones. At some point, let’s just say Taiwan says, “We can’t tolerate this anymore. We’ve got to fire a warning shot, or we’ve got to do a fake dogfight with one of these planes to show them that we’re not tolerating the continued encroachment.” Then one thing leads to another and those two planes splash down. You think the next day it’s cool? Does that bother you? Does that worry you?

Because that scenario does worry me. Do I think automatically we’re off to the races? No. But that kind of scenario, in an already unstable operational environment — I don’t know that the risk of a tactical mistake leading to a change in the strategic situation — I’m not at one end of the spectrum on this that you’re pushing against, but I’m not quite where you are either.

Jordan Schneider: It wouldn’t be a nice thing. You’d lose some sleep over it.

Jake Sullivan: That’s the thought experiment to me. Why would you lose sleep over it? Because you’d be like, well, there is a possibility — maybe not that immediately the invasion force comes flowing over the horizon, but rather that it leads to a change in the national conversation on the mainland. It leads to arguments that we just can’t tolerate this, there has to be punishment and so on. Can that contribute to a shift in a negative direction that raises the risk of outright conflict? It can. I don’t want to overstate the case because I take your point, but that kind of scenario worries me more in a way than the US and China bumping up against each other.

India-Pakistan is another example where I think a mistake can lead to very rapid escalation. To me, it’s a little bit more condition-specific than just in the abstract.

Jordan Schneider: But isn’t the lesson of the most recent India-Pakistan crisis almost the other thing? It’s like, okay, we have a game now and we just play it every five years.

Actually, it probably doesn’t feel like that if you’re getting woken up at 4 o’clock in the morning.

Jake Sullivan: You know what? I’ll take that point. That’s fair because I basically agree with you that at the end of the day, the two sides don’t want to go to all-out war, so there are reasons for them to end up not doing so. I withdraw the India-Pakistan example.

Jordan Schneider: Was it a mistake for Pelosi to go to Taiwan?

Jake Sullivan: Look, I want to be fair to the Speaker. I’m going to answer your question, but I want to do it in a fair way. I spoke with her about going to Taipei, and she basically said to me, “All you White House Democrats and Republicans — you’re all too restrained. I should be able to do what I want to do, and nobody should tell us whether we can go to a city.” She was pretty clear and direct in her view.

I believe that the cost to Taiwan of that visit far exceeded the benefit to Taiwan of that visit. For me, it’s pretty simple calculus.

Jordan Schneider: How so?

Jake Sullivan: Well, it led to not just an immediate reaction by China that put a huge amount of pressure on Taiwan, but it led to a change in the operational environment around Taiwan that has not gone back to the way it was before — substantive, negative changes in Taiwan’s immediate environment. On the positive side, some symbolism, I guess.

Managing the Stress of Putin’s Nuke Threats

Jordan Schneider: On the accidental risk stuff, speaking of you getting stressed out — the Putin nuclear scenario is probably the scariest thing you had a 5-10% chance of seeing, I assume. You’ve already given some reflections on this, but maybe from — we had all these NSC management questions — this is the big one. What sticks with you?

Jake Sullivan: This is fall of ‘22. The Ukrainians are on this counteroffensive in Kherson and Kharkiv, and the intelligence community at the most senior levels comes to the President and says, “If there’s a catastrophic collapse of Russian lines and Putin feels that he’s in danger of potentially losing the war, there’s a 50% chance — a coin toss — that he will use tactical nuclear weapons to avert that defeat and shore up his lines.”

By the way, this is not just people guessing out of thin air. These are people who have studied this issue, are watching everything going on, who have amassed a fairly broad-based view across the intelligence community of this judgment. You’re the President of the United States, and you’re like, “All right, we’ve got to deal with that. Can’t be paralyzed by it. You’ve got to keep supporting Ukraine, but we’ve got to deal with that.”

We gathered in the Situation Room. We ran tabletop exercises. What would happen? What would we do in response? What would they do in response to our response? Not very pleasant scenarios, all told. We communicated directly with the Russians about the consequences of taking such an action. Of course, we reached out to, among others, China to get them to weigh in as well.

But this is the kind of thing where the difference between a commentator saying, “I don’t think it’s a very serious risk,” and actually being in the seat, having the responsibility to the American people of taking very seriously what sober, senior intelligence professionals are telling you while also continuing to support Ukraine — that was very real and very challenging.

I do not believe that this was all just BS. This was a risk. If it had happened — the first nuclear use since Hiroshima and Nagasaki — the United States would have had to take meaningful action in response. That action could easily have led to a totally different form of escalation between us and Russia. It’s good it did not happen. A lot of people look at the fact that it didn’t happen and say this was all overblown. I think we had some influence over it, and events on the battlefield had some influence over it as well.

Share

Jordan Schneider: We’ve talked about a few different escalatory ladders — the econ-tech fights, planes hitting each other in the sky. But this is different than what they were theorizing in the ’50s and ’60s. Thoughts? What’s my question here?

Jake Sullivan: I think your question is, how the hell do you deal with that?

It raises a question about risk tolerance, right? You’re walking on a narrow mountain path and there’s a steep cliff off to one side — one side’s the mountain, the other side’s a steep cliff. The path is, call it five feet wide. Do you walk right on the edge, saying, “I don’t think I’ll slip”? Or do you walk up against the mountain?

A lot of the debates over the nuclear escalation thing is, why weren’t you closer to the edge? Why were you closer to the mountain? The right answer on this is you have to keep moving forward. You’ve got to go from point A to point B. You can’t stop providing weapons to Ukraine, intelligence to Ukraine, capacity to Ukraine. But you also have a responsibility to the American people not to fall off the cliff.

Jordan Schneider: Can you talk about psychologically, yourself and your team? It’s one thing to be in the CIA for 30 years and be thinking about Russian nuclear posture. It’s another thing when it’s the week when it’s more risky than any time since the ’80s or even the ’60s.

Jake Sullivan: One thing that I’m playing around with in my head — I don’t want to say it wrong because it’s going to sound somehow like I didn’t take my job seriously enough, and I took my job deadly seriously — is that stress and stakes and consequences normalize. What I mean by that is the human capacity to just adjust to your circumstances.

I was an associate at a law firm in Minneapolis working on commercial litigation. We had these cases that kept me up at night. I stressed out over whether we got something right or wrong. I second-guessed and recriminated, the whole thing. Then I end up in this nuclear scenario. These are night and day. But somehow human beings don’t just have an infinite level of calibrating stress. They just have their bands, and then they’re presented with things. Some of them are life-or-death situations, and some of them are life-or-death decision-making situations. You get up in the morning and you go to work and you do your job and then you go home at night and you execute your responsibility to the best of your ability to do so.

I don’t have a better answer than that, but I don’t feel like, “Oh, I was some special person.” I was just a guy who had a job. This was the problem presented in that job, and I had to deal with it. A lot of it is just about being able to inhabit that mindset and say, “I’ve got to go to work. This is my job today.” But that didn’t mean I didn’t sweat through a lot of shirts.

Jordan Schneider: It’s a good point. The Marines fought on Peleliu and Iwo Jima. You’re going to an office.

Jake Sullivan: Exactly. This is such a good way of putting it. Somebody is walking into the teeth of gunfire at Omaha Beach who, a year before, was a schoolteacher in my hometown of Minneapolis.

The ability to normalize just your situation — this is my job today. That’s so much more real than anything I had to deal with. Yet we all have really stressful and complicated situations in our lives. Even when something is objectively not that high stakes, I don’t begrudge people that they feel super stressed in that situation because they’re just operating within the range we all operate of stress and stakes based on their lived experience.

Jordan Schneider: But there have been very few humans in human history who have stared down a non-zero risk of nuclear war and managed through it. Even then, it still is a unique experience.

Jake Sullivan: It’s a lot. It is a lot. It’s heavy. The other important thing is we’re all just human beings leading three-dimensional lives while dealing with all of this — dealing with family stuff or health stuff or whatever the case may be. I talked before about how you can get ground down in these jobs and lose a certain sense of who you are. There is a way in which the stress and the stakes harden you. You don’t even quite realize it at the time.

Being vigilant for that, to try to remember at the end of the day that it’s your job to be a good and decent person, is a really important thing. That requires more discipline than often in a given day you can bring to bear.

Jordan Schneider: You said on a podcast you still don’t sleep well. Did you sleep well before?

Jake Sullivan: In Trump one, there was a period where I had a really hard time sleeping post-2016. But yeah, I would say I slept pretty well. I don’t now, because in many ways, a lot of the things that we dealt with had no perfect outcomes achievable. The outcome was going to be painful in one way or another. There were some painful outcomes, and then they happen and you’re like, “Well, what if I’d done this? Or what if I’d done that? Or what if we had done this? What could we learn from that?” You turn it over in your head, and then you do all of that with perfect hindsight, which is a super problematic thing to do because you could only make those decisions in the moment.

But I don’t know — that’s just going to be what it is for me for a while. I don’t think that’s a bad thing. In a way, the completion of discharging your responsibility in a job like I had is not to walk out the day you’re done and just go, “All right, someone else’s problem.” It’s to continue to wrestle with it indefinitely. That’s part of the service.

Jordan Schneider: You mentioned earlier that you think the thinking around AI and national policy is really poor. What are the hottest questions you wish there was better thought on?

Jake Sullivan: Let me be absolutely clear. If I said that, I don’t mean to say it’s really poor. I mean to say that we’re in the early innings. There are brilliant people thinking about this, and they’re thinking thoughts way beyond in complexity and sophistication that I could think. My concern is that we are designing strategy — and who’s the “we”? Because it’s a combination of this government plus these big private companies that are driving the frontier, without really fully unearthing the assumptions underlying those strategies.

A world in which we are rapidly approaching AGI and ASI versus a world in which it’s a boundary and jagged pathway towards greater capability — what you would do across a range of different inputs is different in those two worlds. Yet I don’t think we sit and work out what our relative confidence is in one world as opposed to the other. What are the can’t-fail or the must-dos, the no-regrets moves? Then what are the things we have to be able to adjust as we gain more information?

That’s just one example of many where getting technologists and strategists together to really go through the underlying assumptions of where all this is going is important. Most of this conversation floats above at a plane of abstraction. As a result, we pursue a policy with a lot of hidden assumptions that we haven’t fully validated or unearthed. That’s my main concern and something I’m turning over in my head and thinking about how to articulate better than I just did.

Jordan Schneider: Maybe more broadly, the process of gathering information, even though it’s under uncertainty and you’ll never get to much less 80% confidence with some of these things — how did you think about it and the sources, and how did that evolve over time for you?

Jake Sullivan: First of all, when you’re in government, access to information is amazing. My friend Kurt Campbell likes to say, “When you’re in government, the shit comes to you. When you’re out of government, you have to go find the shit.” There’s a simple, crude elegance to that. We could have senior people from the AI labs come in and actually present to us where they were and their capabilities and where they were going and what concerned them — literally in the flesh, just do it. We could also get all of the industry data and analysis synthesized by a team of people at any agency in the US government and supply it to you as well.

The biggest weakness on the US government side in terms of the consumption of information is that we tend to over-prioritize classified information over unclassified information because we somehow think it’s more special. Particularly in technology, it’s the unclassified information where you really find out what the hell is going on. But basically, all you can do is try to bring in as much as you can.

Then I believe in the debate method — basically having people on opposite sides or at different ends of the spectrum on a given question of what’s likely to happen actually debate it out, unearth it, and figure out where they agree and where they disagree and isolate the points of disagreement. That method gives you the best confidence that you’ve actually kicked the tires on all the potential perspectives. Then you just have to decide where you land, where you fall.

Jordan Schneider: Trump two does not seem to see China as the threat that you guys and Trump one seemed to characterize it as. Two questions fall out of that — to what extent do you think, if he really tries, he can change the tenor of this relationship? How structural is the competition, basically? Second, given that this is what they’re seeing, if you had foresight into this, would the bias have been to push harder or push less hard?

Jake Sullivan: The second’s a good question. Increasingly, it’s going to be a salient question because we are going to see more swings in US foreign policy in the years ahead. Future National Security Advisors will have to contemplate dramatic departures one way or the other. We’re seeing that play out right now.

On the first question, here’s what I think — It’s structural. The United States and China are two big, ambitious, dynamic countries with proud people who want to succeed and frankly don’t want someone else calling the shots or having undue influence or having greater capacity than they have. We have two different political systems, two different value systems. Therefore, competition is a feature of the relationship.

What I don’t think is structural is that it has to be conflict. Where we have the ability to influence things is to manage that competition effectively. But the idea that you can just wish the competition away and go with win-win, peaceful coexistence and all these kinds of phrases — I don’t really buy that. Frankly, I don’t think China buys it deep down either.

President Trump can talk about the G2, and I completely agree he looks at this through an economic lens, a mercantilist lens, and not a lens of strategic competition. But at the end of the day, these structural factors will shine through. I have to think about whether it would have made us do something different. That’s a bit of a mind-bender, projecting back and then forward, but it’s a totally reasonable question.

Jordan Schneider: You talked earlier about the personal weight of all this, and you said somewhere that you almost envy the people who can have more confidence in their calls. The irony, of course, is this new book about McNamara at war. He’s the one who projected the most confidence out of any of these folks, and he had panic attacks. It was actually all a cover for all his insecurity.

Jake Sullivan: I was being a little wry when I said that. That’s understated Minnesota wryness. What I meant was I just find it so interesting that people can assert things like, “Yes, it’s this.” You’re like, “Congratulations, I’m so glad that you just know that.”

Going back to the point about hard-won experience — most of these issues do not have easy calls. They have trade-offs and they have puts and takes. I really admire the self-confidence because I could sleep at night super easily then. It’s just a hell of a lot less pain and suffering, but I don’t think it’s right.

Jordan Schneider: I have three book recommendations for you.

Feeding Ghosts — this one is best suited for midnight reading. It’s actually a graphic memoir. It just won the Pulitzer. It’s a personal history with the US-China arc in it that I can’t wait for you to read.

The Social History of the Machine Gun — it is probably the most stylishly written military history I’ve ever come across. It goes through the technology, the companies, the acquisition side, and then the human and strategic implications. Fantastic. Someone’s going to have to write the social history of the drone. We didn’t get to drones today. We’ll have you back maybe. But that book’s a real treat.

High taxes, burdensome regulations, and an anti-business climate are pushing the wealthiest and high-earners to sunnier, lower-tax havens such as Nevada, Texas, and Florida.

Far from the progressive narrative of a booming millionaire class, recent data reveals a selective exodus among the ultra-wealthy, threatening the state's economic vitality.

Consider the numbers. A 2024 SmartAsset study, analyzing IRS migration data, found Washington lost a net 222 high-earning millennial households (incomes over $200,000) between 2021 and 2022, the eighth-highest loss nationwide. By mid-2025, a follow-up report showed wealthy Gen Z-ers fleeing even faster, with Washington second only to Illinois in net outflows of affluent young professionals. These aren't isolated cases; they're symptomatic of a broader flight fueled by policies like the 2022 capital gains tax and looming wealth tax and income tax proposals.

Prime examples are easy to find. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos relocated to Miami in 2023, citing Florida's no-income-tax environment as a draw for his fortune. Elon Musk followed suit, shifting Tesla's headquarters (from California) and his own residence to Texas in 2021, escaping a similar regulatory environment to Washington. More quietly, tech executives from Microsoft and Amazon are bolting to Las Vegas. A March 2025 Bloomberg report detailed how Nevada relators are closing deals on $8 million-plus homes for Seattle transplants (one exiting resident this author knows), drawn by zero state income or capital gains taxes. Microsoft President Brad Smith warned at a GeekWire event that such moves could inflict ""lasting damage"" on Washington's tech sector, raising consumer prices and slashing jobs.

Progressive think tanks, like the Institute for Policy Studies, tout a 46.9% growth in Washington's ""millionaire class"" from 2022 to 2024, from 463,000 to 681,000 individuals. But this masks the truth. Aggregate growth stems from stock market gains and new entrants, not retention of top talent. Ultra-high-net-worth residents, those with $50 million-plus, saw only a 42.6% rise, yet anecdotal evidence and migration stats show the biggest fish swimming away. The capital gains tax raised $1.2 billion, but at what cost? For every dollar collected, the state risks losing billions in economic activity from departing innovators.

The wealthy among us remodel homes, buy cars, invest in start-ups and give money to philanthropic endeavors. All of this economic activity creates jobs for those lower on the income ladder.

This exodus isn't inevitable. Repeal the capital gains tax, scrap the wealth tax proposals, and ease regulations to make Washington more competitive.

Japanese group Tokyo Gas Co., Ltd. has completed the sale of its US subsidiary TVL LLC to Grayrock Energy for $255mn. TVL LLC owns upstream gas exploration and production assets in the Haynesville and Cotton Valley formations, located in Louisiana within the Ark-La-Tex region. This transaction marks a targeted divestment rather than a general withdrawal from the US gas market, reinforcing Tokyo Gas’s dynamic management of its upstream portfolio.

Strategic reorganisation in US upstream gas

TVL LLC is part of a broader structure built by Tokyo Gas in the US through TG Natural Resources LLC (TGNR), formed following the 2020 acquisition of Castleton Resources. The divested assets span approximately 315,400 net acres in the Haynesville/Cotton Valley. By selling TVL LLC, Tokyo Gas reduces its exposure to a specific asset pocket while reinforcing its positions in core production hubs.

Tokyo Gas’s “Compass Transformation” strategy for 2023–2025 and 2026–2028 emphasises capital reallocation to high-value segments, particularly the liquefied natural gas (LNG) chain. This strategic focus is supported by enhanced positions in American shale gas assets.

Major investments maintained in shale gas

The sale of TVL follows two major acquisitions by TGNR: Rockcliff Energy II for approximately $2.7bn in 2023 and 70% of Chevron’s East Texas gas assets for $525mn in 2025. With over 400,000 net acres and a production rate of 1.3 billion cubic feet equivalent per day, TGNR is now a central pillar in Tokyo Gas’s US gas strategy.

Grayrock Energy, a private operator active in Texas and Oklahoma, is strengthening its position in the Haynesville/Cotton Valley through this deal. TVL’s producing assets offer potential synergies with existing Grayrock holdings, paving the way for refinancing or future divestment.

Capital discipline and growing shareholder pressure

The TVL LLC divestment comes as Tokyo Gas faces increasing pressure to improve capital efficiency. In spring, the group announced a net income target of ¥131bn for FY2026, alongside plans for share buybacks and dividend increases. It also revealed plans to divest approximately ¥100bn in assets, including real estate.

The entry of US fund Elliott Management into the capital structure has accelerated this portfolio reshaping. The transaction with Grayrock Energy demonstrates Tokyo Gas’s willingness to monetise non-core assets while maintaining its ambitions in the US gas market, particularly through synergies between shale production and LNG value chains.

The increase in both energy costs and delinquencies may suggest that consumers are falling behind on other bills, too.
But AI data centers are known for their massive use of electricity, and threaten to further increase utility bills for everyday Americans.
During Trump’s first six months in office, there was a 3.8% increase in households with severely overdue utility bills.","WASHINGTON (AP) — More people are falling behind on paying their bills to keep on the lights and heat their homes, according to a new analysis of consumer data — a warning sign for the U.S. economy and another political headache for President Donald Trump.

Past due balances to utility companies jumped 9.7% annually to $789 between the April-June periods of 2024 and 2025, said The Century Foundation, a liberal think tank, and the advocacy group Protect Borrowers. The increase has overlapped with a 12% jump in monthly energy bills during the same period.

Consumers usually prioritize their utility bills along with their mortgages and auto debt, said Julie Margetta Morgan, the foundation’s president. The increase in both energy costs and delinquencies may suggest that consumers are falling behind on other bills, too.

“There’s a lot of information out there about rising utility costs, but here we can actually look at what that impact has been on families in terms of how they’re falling behind,” Margetta Morgan said.

Troubles paying electricity and natural gas bills reflect something of an economic quandary for Trump, who is promoting the buildout of the artificial intelligence industry as a key part of an economic boom he has promised for America. But AI data centers are known for their massive use of electricity, and threaten to further increase utility bills for everyday Americans.

These troubles also come as Trump faces political pressure from voters fed up with the high cost of living. The president spoke about the economy and affordability issues Monday at an event hosted by the McDonald’s fast food company.

“We have it almost at the sweet spot and prices are coming down on different things,” Trump said at the event, adding that inflation has been “normalized” at a “low level.”

Ever since Republicans saw their fortunes sag in off-year elections this month and affordability was identified as the top issue, Trump has been trying to convince the public that prices are falling. Fast-rising electricity bills could be an issue in some congressional battlegrounds in next year’s midterm elections.

Trump has put a particular emphasis on prices at the pump. Gasoline accounts for about 3% of the consumer price index, slightly less than the share belonging to electricity and natural gas bills — meaning that possible savings on gasoline could be more than offset by higher utility bills.

The president maintains that any troubling data on inflation is false and that Democrats are simply trying to hurt his administration’s reputation.

“In fact, costs under the TRUMP ADMINISTRATION are tumbling down, helped greatly by gasoline and ENERGY,” Trump posted on social media Friday. “Affordability is a lie when used by the Dems.”

Nearly 6 million households have utility debt “so severe” that it will soon be reported to collection agencies, according to the foundation’s analysis, drawn from the University of California Consumer Credit Panel.

During Trump’s first six months in office, there was a 3.8% increase in households with severely overdue utility bills.

“Voters are frustrated and families are hurting because these tech giants are cutting backroom deals with politicians, and it’s causing their power bills to go up,” said Mike Pierce, executive director of Protect Borrowers. “If the Trump administration doesn’t want to do its job and protect families and make life more affordable, I guess that’s its choice.”

Both Margetta Morgan and Pierce previously worked at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a government agency formed in part to track trends in household borrowing to prevent potential abuses. The Trump administration has essentially shut down the bureau.

The administration has so far said it has no responsibility for any increases in electricity prices, since those are often regulated by state utility boards. The White House maintains that utility costs are higher in Democratic states that rely on renewable forms of energy.

“Electricity prices are a state problem,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told ABC News this month. “There are things that the federal government can control. Local electricity prices are not one of them.”

The new analysis of utility bills by the groups counters that the Trump administration is contributing to higher utility costs “by impeding renewable energy generation” including solar and wind power.

While that analysis is a warning sign, other economic analyses on consumers suggest their finances are stable despite some emerging pressures.

The New York Federal Reserve has said delinquency rates of 90 days or more for mortgages, auto loans and student debt have each increased over the past 12 months, though it said mortgage delinquencies are “relatively low.” An analysis of debit and credit card spending by the Bank of America Institute showed that consumers’ “overall financial health looks sound.”

First Solar announced it will invest $330 million in a US module manufacturing facility in Gaffney, South Carolina.

The new facility will span over one million square feet and is designed for the production of First Solar’s Series 7 thin-film solar modules. The plant is scheduled to commence commercial operations in the second half of 2026.

This expansion will add an estimated 600 new jobs to the region. It is projected to increase First Solar’s total US annual production capacity to 17.7 gigawatts (GW), adding 3.7 GW of new capacity.

The investment is part of a broader strategy to solidify First Solar’s U.S. manufacturing base. The company currently operates facilities in Perrysburg and Lake Township, Ohio. This South Carolina announcement follows a separate $1.1 billion investment in new capacity, which includes a new factory in Louisiana and expansion of its existing Ohio footprint, both expected to be operational in 2025.

First Solar utilizes a thin-film technology platform that differs from traditional silicon-based solar panels. The company states its modules have a carbon footprint that is up to 30% lower than that of typical crystalline silicon PV panels manufactured in China.

The company’s expansion is occurring in a market influenced by U.S. industrial policy. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) includes advanced manufacturing production credits designed to incentivize domestic production of solar components. And this year’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act enacted Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) restrictions, barring solar projects from tax credits if they source products from Chinese businesses or businesses with substantial investment from Chinese entities.

“The passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the Administration’s trade policies boosted demand for American energy technology, requiring a timely, agile response that allows us to meet the moment,” said Mark Widmar, chief executive officer, First Solar. “We expect that this new facility will enable us to serve the US market with technology that is compliant with the Act’s stringent provisions, within timelines that align with our customers’ objectives.”

The move into South Carolina follows recent challenges for other manufacturers in the US solar market. Qcells, another major producer, recently faced customs delays on components and furloughed workers in Georgia.

President Trump has been sending the National Guard throughout the US, with the latest deployment being to Portland, Oregon, before it was blocked by a judge.

But in Louisiana, Gov. Jeff Landry is welcoming the idea of federal troops. Roughly one week ago, he announced that he'd asked President Trump to send the National Guard to New Orleans, Shreveport and Baton Rouge.

Capital Access reporter Brooke Thorington spoke with East Baton Rouge Mayor-President Sid Edwards about his view of troops coming to the capital city, and how he hopes they would help address problems of crime, traffic and blight.

As electric vehicles make their way into the marketplace, consumers are asking questions about the practicality of these cars for all of our needs. Especially when it comes to hauling, towing and long-distance road trips.

Travis Pittman, private EV charging consultant and a contributor to Louisiana Clean Fuels, tells us about a recent case study he did comparing EVs to standard gasoline cars.

The Plan brings together more than 30 international partners and over 50 coordinated actions to advance national, subnational, and sectoral strategies for doubling energy efficiency by 2030. It will deliver roadmaps, policy frameworks, training programmes, and investment pipelines to scale efficient technologies and transform commitments into measurable results across countries.

The Plan is supported by a broad coalition of leading institutions including UNIDO, UNEP Copenhagen Climate Centre, WRI, CLASP, RMI, WWF, AEEE, OECD-CEFIM, Solar Impulse Foundation, Energy Transitions Commission, Consumers International, C2ES, PEEB, AEE, the Department of Energy of the Philippines, and the Energy Efficiency Movement, among others.

Recognizing that financing remains one of the biggest barriers to scaling action, Mission Efficiency has launched the Energy Efficiency De-Risking Platform, a key component of the Plan designed to connect investors with efficiency projects and standardize tools that reduce risk and unlock capital flows.

The Mission Efficiency Plan elevates energy efficiency as both a powerful climate solution and a major investment opportunity – as communities require upgrades to a broad swathe of infrastructure, appliances and services, plus strengthened energy grids to meet growing energy demand and increased resilience against the worst impacts of climate change.

As COP30 — the “Implementation COP” — focuses on translating global pledges into real progress, Mission Efficiency is contributing through its active role in the COP30 Activation Groups, which convene leading initiatives to advance practical, high-impact solutions. Under the Transitioning Energy, Industry, and Transport axis of the COP30 Action Agenda, Mission Efficiency is working with governments, financiers, and technical partners to ensure that energy efficiency becomes central to implementation—linking policy ambition with investment and delivery on the ground.

RELATED: El Paso residents react as utility rate hikes add up","The El Paso City Council has unanimously voted against a proposed 27% price increase by Texas Gas, reflecting strong opposition from local residents.

The council's 9-0 decision sends a clear message to the Texas Railroad Commission in Austin, which will ultimately decide on the proposal.

Residents expressed concerns about the financial burden the hike would impose, with Mary Woodruff-Herman highlighting potential hardships such as cutting back on medications and travel.

Harrison Parker reports on City Council rejecting gas rate hike

Angel Ulloa criticized the utility's justification, saying, ""Their explanation felt extremely incomplete.""

State Rep. Vince Perez and other El Paso representatives echoed these concerns, noting the timing amid rising inflation and costs.

In a joint letter, they stated, ""Our people can’t afford an increase."" City Council member Deanna Maldonado-Rocha emphasized the devastating impact on residents forced to choose between essential needs. The Texas Railroad Commission is expected to vote on the proposal in early 2026.

City officials said the decision follows months of review, analysis by the City’s financial and legal experts, and extensive community engagement, including eight public meetings across all districts earlier this month.

City Council has been clear from the start: any increase must be justified, data-driven, and equitable,” said City Attorney Karla Nieman. “This Council is standing up for working families by rejecting a proposal that would have unfairly shifted costs from other regions of Texas onto our community. We remain committed to advocating before the Railroad Commission to ensure that El Paso residents are treated fairly.

The case now proceeds to the Railroad Commission of Texas, which will make the final determination in early 2026.

Residents made their voices heard throughout this process, and I want to thank every El Pasoan who spoke up,” said Mayor Renard U. Johnson. “Today’s decision reflects that input and reinforces our duty to protect fairness, transparency, and accountability for every household and business in our city. We will not allow El Paso families to be overcharged to subsidize other regions. We will continue to stand up, push back when necessary, and defend what is right for El Paso.

El Paso's delegation to the Texas House of Representatives has urged the City of El Paso to reject Texas Gas Service's proposal to increase rates for local customers.

In a letter sent ahead of the city's hearing on the matter, Speaker Pro Tempore Joe Moody and Representatives Dr. Mary E. González, Eddie Morales Jr., Claudia Ordaz, and Vincent M. Perez emphasized the financial strain such an increase would impose on residents.

""We’re writing to say very clearly that our people can’t afford an increase,"" they stated.

El Paso residents could soon be paying more for utilities as several companies move forward with rate changes that combined, could add up to about $40 more a month — though the final amount will depend on pending decisions.

According to Texas Gas Service, the utility is proposing a 27% rate increase for El Paso customers. A change that would raise the average residential bill by about $10 to $14 per month. The company says the increase is needed to cover service costs and maintain reliable service.

Impact of WOTUS Proposal on Agriculture For producers, the proposal could simplify compliance by narrowing which water features fall under federal oversight and confirming exclusions that many farm groups have long advocated.
Zeldin says the aim is “protecting the nation’s navigable waters from pollution” while preventing unnecessary burdens on farmers and ranchers.
Due to litigation that followed the January 2023 WOTUS rule, which was considered in the Sackett decision, different states are following different rules.
Based on these potential timelines, a new — potentially final — WOTUS rule could take effect as early as late February.","Farmers and ranchers could soon face fewer regulatory hurdles when working near waterways, as EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers released a new proposal on Nov. 17 to redefine “Waters of the United States” (WOTUS). The agencies say the proposed rule is designed to bring long-requested clarity to what features fall under federal jurisdiction potentially reducing permitting uncertainty for agriculture, landowners and rural businesses.

The proposed rule will soon be published in the Federal Register, according to EPA. Once posted, the public will have the opportunity to comment through the Federal Register or via Regulations.gov.

The definition of WOTUS determines when producers must secure permits for projects that could affect surface water quality, including common activities such as building terraces, installing drainage or expanding livestock operations. EPA officials say the new proposal aims to align fully with the Supreme Court’s Sackett decision and prevent farmers from needing lawyers or consultants simply to determine whether a water feature on their land is federally regulated.

The proposal follows EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin’s promise in March to launch the biggest deregulatory action in history and a series of listening sessions in April and May that asked states, tribes, industry and agriculture to weigh in on WOTUS needs.

Clearer Definition After Years of Confusion

Zeldin and Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works Adam Telle emphasize the rule is designed to be clear, durable and commonsense.

Key elements include:

Defined terms such as relatively permanent, continuous surface connection, and tributary to outline which waters qualify under the Clean Water Act.

A requirement that jurisdictional tributaries must have predictable, consistent flow to traditional navigable waters.

Wetlands protections are limited to wetlands that physically touch and are indistinguishable from regulated waters for a consistent duration each year.

Reaffirmed exclusions important to agriculture, including prior converted cropland, certain ditches and waste treatment systems.

A new exclusion for groundwater.

Locally-familiar terminology, such as “wet season,” to help determine whether water features meet regulatory thresholds.

EPA says these changes are intended to reduce uncertainty that has stemmed from years of shifting definitions across administrations.

Impact of WOTUS Proposal on Agriculture

For producers, the proposal could simplify compliance by narrowing which water features fall under federal oversight and confirming exclusions that many farm groups have long advocated.

Zeldin says the aim is “protecting the nation’s navigable waters from pollution” while preventing unnecessary burdens on farmers and ranchers. He criticizes past Democratic administrations for broad interpretations that, in his view, extended federal reach to features that did not warrant regulation.

Farm groups have argued for years that unclear or overly broad definitions can lead to significant costs, delays and legal risks when planning conservation work, drainage projects or infrastructure improvements. A more consistent rule could reduce project backlogs and limit case-by-case determinations that often slow progress during planting, construction or livestock expansion.

“We’ve seen WOTUS definitions, guidance and legal arguments change with each administration,” said Garrett Hawkins, president of the Missouri Farm Bureau, during the May 1 EPA listening session for agriculture. He adds: “farmers, land owners and small businesses are the ones who suffer the most when we don’t have clear rules.”

Several of those who gave testimony and public comment during the ag listening session argued that farmers and ranchers, who already struggle with unpredictable markets and tight margins, shouldn’t have to hire experts to identify elements of their own land.

“A practical WOTUS definition will allow the average landowner — not an engineer, not an attorney, not a wetland specialist — to walk out on their property, see a water feature and make, at minimum, a preliminary determination about whether a feature is federally jurisdictional,” says Kim Brackett, vice president of the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, who also gave testimony in May.

Alignment With the Sackett Decision

After the Supreme Court’s 2023 Sackett v. EPA ruling, which restricted federal authority over many wetlands, the agencies say the previous WOTUS definition no longer aligned with the law. EPA already issued a memo earlier this year clarifying limits on jurisdiction over adjacent wetlands. The newly proposed rule is the next step in that process.

The proposed rule focuses on relatively permanent bodies of water — streams, rivers, lakes and oceans — and wetlands that are physically connected to those waters. Seasonal and regional variations are incorporated, including waters that flow consistently during the wetter months.

The current situation is a regulatory patchwork. Due to litigation that followed the January 2023 WOTUS rule, which was considered in the Sackett decision, different states are following different rules. Currently, 24 states, mostly the coastal and Great Lakes states, are operating on the 2023 rule, while the other 26 states, mostly those in center and in the Southeast, are operating on pre-2015 WOTUS rule.

Oversight Rests With State and Tribes

A major theme of the proposal is cooperative federalism, giving more authority to states and tribes to manage local land and water resources. EPA says the rule preserves necessary federal protections while recognizing states and tribal governments are best positioned to oversee many smaller or isolated water features.

Sections 101b and 510 of the CWA are key structural examples of the concept of cooperative federalism. The sections give states and tribes the right to set standards and issue permits for federal activities that could discharge pollutants into a water of the U.S. within the state or territory. The most common example of this are 404 dredge and fill permits.

This focus on cooperative federalism was the main chorus of the EPA’s listening session for states, held April 29, especially as it concerns wetlands.

“If more wetlands are excluded from WOTUS, then certain federal projects would not require a section 401 water quality certification by the states,” noted Jennifer Congdon, director of federal affairs for New York Department of Environmental Conservation, during the states’ listening session. She argues that such a situation could impair water quality within a state, thus violating states’ rights under the CWA.

What Happens Next

The proposed rule will soon be published in the Federal Register, kicking off a 45-day public comment period. EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers will hold two hybrid public meetings, and details for submitting comments or registering to speak will be available on EPA’s website.

After the comment period, the agencies plan to move quickly toward a final rule.

“Once the rule is finalized, it typically takes effect 60 days after publication in the Federal Register pursuant to Congressional Review Act requirements,” the EPA press office told The Packer earlier this summer.

Based on these potential timelines, a new — potentially final — WOTUS rule could take effect as early as late February.",https://assets.farmjournal.com/dims4/default/f1eba75/2147483647/strip/true/crop/853x480+0+0/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffj-corp-pub.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fs3fs-public%2Firrigration_ditch_feature.png,N,,2025-11-18 12:08:22.761749

But here’s the silver lining that mainstream coverage misses: this is exactly what the used EV market needed.","A record wave of electric vehicle lease returns is set to flood the used car market in 2026, creating what analysts are calling an “EV avalanche” that could dramatically reshape pricing dynamics and deliver unprecedented opportunities for budget-conscious buyers.

At least 243,000 EV leases will expire in 2026, with the figure potentially reaching 330,000 vehicles, according to J.D. Power data reported by Autoblog. This represents more than three times the volume of EV lease returns seen in 2025, setting up a supply surge at precisely the moment federal tax credits have vanished from the market.

The timing couldn’t be more significant. These returning vehicles represent the tail end of the “lease loophole” era when federal incentives made leasing EVs more attractive than purchasing, driving lease rates to historic highs. Now those same vehicles are returning to a market fundamentally transformed by the September 30, 2025 expiration of the $7,500 federal tax credit.

Used EV Prices Already Dropping Below Gas Vehicles

The used EV market is already showing signs of the coming shift. Edmunds data shows that used EVs currently average $29,922, approximately $1,100 below the average cost for a comparable gas-powered vehicle. This price advantage marks a significant reversal from just two years ago when used EVs commanded premium pricing due to limited supply.

More importantly, used EVs are moving faster than any other powertrain type. According to Edmunds’ Q3 2025 analysis, electric vehicles sold in an average of 34 days compared to 41 days for the overall used market. Eight of the 20 fastest-selling three-year-old vehicles were EVs, despite limited 2022 model availability.

The question now is what happens when supply triples in 2026. Dealerships already dealing with slower new EV sales following the tax credit expiration will face hundreds of thousands of lease returns requiring remarkably space and remarketing resources.

The Loyalty Gap: Sentiment Versus Reality

While 94% of current EV owners say they will “definitely” or “probably” consider an EV for their next vehicle, according to J.D. Power’s 2025 Electric Vehicle Experience Ownership Study, actual behavior tells a different story. In 2025, only 62% of returning franchise EV lessees actually chose to purchase or lease another EV.

That 32-percentage-point gap between stated intention and actual behavior becomes critical when applied to 243,000 returning leases. If the 2025 pattern holds, roughly 92,000 lessees who could have gone electric again will instead choose gas vehicles or hybrids—adding significantly to dealer used EV inventory challenges.

The disconnect reflects broader market uncertainty. With tax credits gone, EV tax credits expiring, and automakers continuing to prioritize hybrid powertrains, drivers may choose to wait rather than commit to electrification. Current EV market share has dropped to just 6% of new vehicle sales in November 2025, down sharply from 12.9% in September when buyers rushed to secure the expiring tax credit.

Post-Tax Credit Market Reality Sets In

The September 30, 2025 tax credit expiration fundamentally altered EV economics overnight. New EV sales plummeted 24% in October compared to September, exactly as industry analysts predicted. Without the $7,500 federal incentive effectively reducing purchase prices, EVs must now compete purely on operational economics and total cost of ownership.

This creates unusual market dynamics. A three-year-old Tesla Model Y or Chevrolet Bolt returning from lease in 2026 could be priced thousands below a comparable new model, even without factoring in the now-expired tax credit that would have applied to new purchases. For buyers focused purely on price, the value proposition of used EVs becomes increasingly compelling.

Automakers are already responding with aggressive tactics. Tesla eliminated down payment requirements on Model Y leases in mid-November, effectively absorbing roughly $3,000 in upfront costs to maintain competitive lease pricing against the rising tide of used inventory. The move signals recognition that new EV sales must compete not just against gas vehicles, but against their own lease returns.

Dealer Dilemma: Inventory Management in Uncertain Times

Dealerships face a complicated calculus. Vehicle leases written in 2022-2023 assumed EVs would retain roughly 50% of their value after three years. Currently, EVs are retaining only about 40% of their value, creating a gap between expected residual values and actual market prices.

Autoblog reports that leases written during the peak incentive era presumed value retention that no longer exists in today’s market. Every day a vehicle sits unsold on the lot represents depreciation, and with 243,000-330,000 units potentially flooding the market, dealers will face pressure to move inventory quickly.

This dynamic benefits buyers tremendously. Models like the Nissan Leaf, Chevrolet Bolt, and Tesla Model Y—which dominated lease sales in 2022-2023—are expected to be widely available at competitive prices. Battery health concerns, once a major barrier to used EV adoption, have largely been addressed by real-world data showing most EVs retain 80-90% of battery capacity after 36,000 miles.

EVXL’s Take

We’ve been tracking this exact scenario for six months, and watching it unfold feels like witnessing a slow-motion car crash that was entirely predictable. Back in July, we reported that nearly 1 million EVs leased between 2022 and early 2025 would be maturing, with 123,000 returning in 2025 alone and 329,000 in 2026. When Senate Republicans pushed to end the $7,500 tax credit in June 2025, we warned the industry was about to face its moment of truth.

Then came the predicted collapse. October EV sales cratered 24% in a single month after the September 30 tax credit expiration. Within weeks, GM announced layoffs and idled $2 billion in battery plants. The dominoes fell exactly as we said they would.

Now we’re watching the next phase: an artificially created lease return tsunami meeting a market stripped of the subsidies that created those leases in the first place. It’s market correction on a massive scale, and it’s going to be painful for dealers and automakers who bet on sustained government support.

But here’s the silver lining that mainstream coverage misses: this is exactly what the used EV market needed. For years, limited supply and inflated new EV prices kept electric vehicles out of reach for average buyers. The “lease loophole” that boosted new EV sales from 2022-2024 is now about to democratize EV access through a flood of three-year-old vehicles hitting the market at prices gas cars can’t match.

The irony is delicious. Federal subsidies artificially inflated new EV demand through generous lease incentives, creating a bubble that must now deflate without those same subsidies. The 2026 lease returns represent the chickens coming home to roost for an industry that became dependent on government support rather than building products that could compete on pure economics.

For buyers, 2026 could be the year EVs finally become genuinely affordable without requiring taxpayer subsidies to bridge the gap. Models with 250+ miles of range, modern tech features, and known battery health will be available for $20,000-$30,000—a price point that actually competes with used gas vehicles on total cost of ownership.

The EV revolution doesn’t need tax credits to succeed. It needs EVs that make economic sense without them. This market correction, painful as it may be for dealers and automakers, might be exactly what moves the industry from subsidy-dependent to genuinely competitive.

We tried a new tool that provides actual EV battery health data, and it worked so well that we think it could be a big game changer in terms of used EVs.","Whether you're a fan of them or not, electric vehicles do offer some advantages over traditional internal combustion engine automobiles. For instance, tests have shown that a high-mileage electric car is basically as efficient as a brand new one. However, lingering in the back of the mind of many EV owners is the ever-present concern of a failing battery. It's not hard to understand why, as a replacement could cost up to $36,000, and that doesn't include the cost of the install.

So no one batted an eye when older tests cautioned drivers to take it easy behind the wheel of an EV, as things like an aggressive lead foot could wear down the battery quicker. It wasn't just pedal-down acceleration that was vilified, either, as even sudden stops have been labeled as detrimental to the health of the battery. The problem, of course, is that any human trying to navigate modern roads day-to-day will regularly need to be aggressive or sudden. Don't you have to accelerate quickly to pass or to merge onto the highway? Haven't there been occasions (through no fault of your own) where you needed to forcefully apply the brakes?

Fortunately, some new research out of Stanford has come to a drastically different conclusion. In fact, quick acceleration, braking, and brief moments of rest could actually lengthen the life of cells inside the battery by as much as 38%. This turns conventional wisdom on its head, and it may provide many EV owners some peace of mind. But why is this new data so different from previous research findings?

The previous approach to this sort of research was to apply a consistent and continual load on the battery to measure its performance and lifespan. This, unfortunately, is completely counter to the unpredictable conditions of real-world driving. Such conditions can vary greatly, especially when considering the actions of other motorists.

So, the team at Stanford decided that rather than a static load, they would instead include tests that mimic realistic loads. These tests cover what happens when continually accelerating and braking as you would when navigating through the city. By applying several different discharge profiles across 92 lithium-ion batteries, the Stanford team proceeded with these for over two years. Not only did this approach reveal some surprising results in terms of battery lifespan, but it also uncovered some problems when exposing EV batteries to constant loads.

This new research discovered that the previous tests were placing strain on the batteries. The constant load facilitated lithium plating, which describes a gathering of metallic lithium on the anode, contributing to battery wear. If that wasn't bad enough, Stanford also discovered that a buildup of high temperatures shortens battery life. This is why electric vehicles like Tesla's, Ford's and GM's use cooling tech on the batteries, to help minimize heat.

While you might not need to be as concerned behind the wheel of your EV in terms of being gentle with the pedals, there are still ways you could hurt your batteries. For example, you should avoid draining the batteries completely or charging them fully. The sweet spot for longevity has been shown to be between 20% and 80% charge.

Just like with traditional gasoline-powered cars, leaving your EV stationary for lengthy periods of time isn't healthy for it. However, there are moments when this may be unavoidable. You should consider keeping a regular eye on your charge level during those times, as it can lower over time. This can drop to levels below 20%, forcing the battery to work harder and leading to a shortened lifespan.

Be sure to stay on top of scheduled battery tests and don't put off software updates, as they could pertain to battery management. For those who want to take it a step further, there are standalone diagnostic devices that can provide more information.

The planned federal incentives for Vulcan would fund equipment used for the domestic production of its magnets.","A Pentagon-backed Research Triangle Park startup could announce as soon as Tuesday plans for a major manufacturing plant in Johnston County — a deal that, if consummated, could make North Carolina a U.S. hub for rare-earth magnets.

RTP-based Vulcan Elements earlier this month announced a $1.4 billion deal with the federal government that would help the company meet its goal of producing up to 10,000 metric tons of Neodymium Iron Boron magnets over several years. The magnets are used in commercial products such as medical devices, electric vehicles, wind turbines, computer chips, and in defense applications such as fighter jets, nuclear submarines and satellites.

People familiar with the effort told WRAL that the company has been considering an expansion that could create upwards of 1,000 jobs and an investment approaching $1 billion. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss the negotiations.

There is no guarantee North Carolina will land the plant, the people said. Vulcan Chief Executive John Maslin told WRAL News this month that the company was engaged in a monthslong, multi-state hunt for expansion sites and that the company expected to make an announcement by the end of November.

A Vulcan spokesman on Monday declined to comment on the company’s plans.

The Johnston County Board of Commissioners on Tuesday morning is holding a special public hearing, where it could approve a proposed economic development agreement for an undisclosed manufacturer considering an expansion in Banner Township. The hearing would follow a meeting of the state Commerce Department’s Economic Investment Committee, which approves state incentives for companies with plans to expand in North Carolina. After the meetings, Gov. Josh Stein is scheduled to make an economic development announcement at an industrial property near the Johnston County town of Benson.

County economic development officials declined to identify the company or describe the project, which was described in a public hearing notice that also didn’t identify the company. David Rhoades, a spokesman for the state Department of Commerce, also declined to discuss the nature of the state’s meeting, adding that the state’s corporate recruiters frequently have discussions with companies about expansion plans. “We don’t comment on those discussions until the companies make a public announcement of their decision,” he said.

Other people familiar with the negotiations told WRAL News that Vulcan would be the subject of those discussions and the announcement.

Economic development deals are often kept secret, protected from the state’s open records laws to enable state and local governments to negotiate with companies and to allow companies to explore options before finalizing major decisions.

It’s common for state and local officials to coordinate the timing of economic development meetings around corporate announcements. Officials often vote on incentives ahead of major economic development announcements, and often on the same day. Public meetings intended to discuss incentives are typically scheduled only after a company has committed to a location.

Stein’s announcement is at the Crosspoint Logistics Center. The project identified in the county notice is proposing its expansion at Crosspoint, which is south of the nexus of Interstate 95 and I-40.

The state’s performance-based incentives packages are often reserved for companies that plan to create lots of jobs that pay above the county average. Grants are typically paid out if the company meets annual hiring and investment targets.

The county is considering a proposal that includes economic incentives in the form of annual cash grants over a 15-year period — to be paid only after job-creation and investment targets have been met, according to the county notice.

“The county believes this project will help stimulate the local economy, result in new taxable capital investments in real and personal property increasing the tax base, and cause the creation by the company of a substantial number of new, permanent jobs,” the county’s hearing announcement said.

Federal funding boost

The federal government’s interest in Vulcan is centered on its efforts to strengthen the nation’s domestic supply of rare-earth magnets.

The U.S. Department of Commerce said Nov. 3 that it struck a preliminary agreement to receive a $50 million equity stake in Vulcan. The company’s expansion would be financed in part by a $620 million direct loan from the Pentagon’s Office of Strategic Capital, $50 million of federal incentives from the Department of Commerce under the CHIPS and Science Act, and $550 million in private capital, the company said. Indiana-based ReElement Technologies would also expand its recycling and processing capabilities under the deal, with help from an $80 million direct loan from the Pentagon, matched by private capital.

The planned federal incentives for Vulcan would fund equipment used for the domestic production of its magnets. ReElement Technologies processes end-of-life magnets, electronic waste, and mined concentrates into high-purity rare earth oxides.

“We know that here in the United States, we need resilient, secure supply chains, both for national security, but also for economic resilience,” Maslin, the Vulcan CEO, told WRAL News in an interview after the deal was struck with the federal government. “If we want to win the AI race, these go in data centers, if we want to build out drones for agriculture, consumer delivery, if we want to lead the robotics revolution, if we want to build cars in this country, we need to make sure that we have capacity of critical components here in the US.

Vulcan Elements’ magnets have already been delivered to customers in the defense and technology sectors. Vulcan and ReElement have worked together to help strengthen domestic supply of rare-earth magnets to build security around some of the nation’s most important sectors, executives said.

“Our investment in Vulcan Elements will accelerate U.S. production of rare earth magnets for American manufacturers,” U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick said in a statement after the federal financing deal was struck earlier this month. “We are laser-focused on bringing critical mineral and rare earth manufacturing back home, ensuring America’s supply chain is strong, secure and perfectly reliable.”",https://images.wral.com/fa7ea18f-4add-4993-9de0-5f710d029032?w=1200&h=630,N,,2025-11-18 00:58:54.876158

The resolution passed unanimously, with support from in-state environmental groups — a far greater success than Grove’s past attempts at legislation to curb California’s oil imports from the Amazon.
Against this backdrop, California oil producers also scored their first major win in years with this year’s SB 237, which paves the way for more drilling in Kern County.
Kevin Koenig of the environmental nonprofit Amazon Watch, which opposed SB 237, said the group was not seeking any partnership with California oil producers.
And Newsom, while in Brazil, dismissed Trump’s reported plans to open the waters off the coast of California to more oil as “dead on arrival.”","California’s refineries get roughly 30 percent of their oil supplies from the Amazon-region nations of Brazil, Ecuador and Guyana, some of which they go on to sell to neighboring states, according to the California Energy Commission. Brazil alone supplied about 20 percent of the state’s imported foreign crude last year, overtaking Saudi Arabia and trailing only Iraq, according to the data.

Most of Brazil’s production is offshore and Guyana’s is entirely offshore, not in the rainforest itself. But the optics have only sharpened as Brazil pushes to drill at the mouth of the Amazon at the same time as it hosts the climate talks and Ecuador, the main source of Amazonian oil, advances new oil auctions in its rainforest despite opposition from Indigenous groups.

In-state critics have seized on the contrast: Conservative commentator and GOP gubernatorial candidate Steve Hilton urged U.N. climate conference organizers last week not to grant Newsom a speaking slot because of California’s oil imports from the region.

Hilton wrote in a letter that “to have Gavin Newsom lecture the world on climate justice while his administration promotes the decimation of the Amazon would be an insult to the conference and its members.” (Hilton didn’t get a response from the organizers, according to a spokesperson.)

California Democrats have long dismissed the argument that importing oil from the Amazon harms the environment as merely a justification to boost in-state drilling. But one of the people who’s made that argument most loudly, Bakersfield Republican state Sen. Shannon Grove, found new allies this year.

She partnered with Becker on a Senate resolution supporting Indigenous communities resisting crude extraction in the Amazon, SR 51, earlier this year. The resolution passed unanimously, with support from in-state environmental groups — a far greater success than Grove’s past attempts at legislation to curb California’s oil imports from the Amazon.

A few things contributed to that: activists from the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of the Ecuadorian Amazon pressed their case, traveling to California this summer to meet lawmakers in Sacramento and protesting in kayaks near the Chevron refinery in Richmond. But also, in-state refineries announced they would close, raising fears of a spike in gas prices — and making lawmakers more sensitive to arguments about where the state’s remaining fuel supply comes from.

“We started this process of really looking holistically at the fuel transition, and part of that is, ‘Let’s get off of oil from the Amazon,’” said Becker.

Against this backdrop, California oil producers also scored their first major win in years with this year’s SB 237, which paves the way for more drilling in Kern County. It marked a major turnaround from just a few years ago, when lobbyists for California oil producers circulated an image of a sloth from the Ecuadorian jungle to urge lawmakers to vote against a state bill requiring a 3,200-foot buffer between new oil wells and neighborhoods, arguing it would increase the state’s reliance on out-of-state oil from environmentally sensitive areas. The pitch was met largely with ridicule from Democrats and in-state environmentalists, who not only passed the law but successfully batted back an oil industry attempt to overturn it at the ballot.

Kevin Koenig of the environmental nonprofit Amazon Watch, which opposed SB 237, said the group was not seeking any partnership with California oil producers. “There’s no sort of strategy of ours that involves a strange-bedfellow scenario where we’re looking to ally with industry,” he said. “We really try to have a united front on the need to get off fossil fuels, whether that’s the Amazon or California.”

What comes next: California oil producers are focused on the future of the state’s refineries, while Amazon Watch and its allies are pushing lawmakers to turn the resolution into a formal task force on Amazon-related extraction and California’s role in it. Becker said he has a few more ideas on how to transition California’s fuel supply, like possibly getting rid of a California-specific gasoline blend or finding alternatives to promote electric vehicles.

But none, he said, include further increasing crude oil extraction within California. And Newsom, while in Brazil, dismissed Trump’s reported plans to open the waters off the coast of California to more oil as “dead on arrival.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F74%2F2f%2F31779645475090471cc74782c591%2Fclimate-cop30-75150.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 22:57:25.640565

The report, authored by over 90 experts from around the world, finds that the pledge’s goal—a 30% reduction in global methane emissions by 2030 compared to 2020 levels—is still attainable. One panelist at the launch highlighted that about 72% of methane mitigation potential is in the oil and gas sector, and the vast majority of the steps that companies and countries can take are low cost. However, the report finds that action needs to be taken on the information being collected. Right now, about 90% of methane leaks detected by satellites are not being addressed.

Casting a Wider Net for Net Zero: A Saturday event hosted by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit and the University of North Carolina examined the 2025 Net Zero Stocktake. The report represents the most comprehensive review to date of net-zero targets put forth by countries, regions, cities, and companies. It found that the quantity of net-zero target-setting is on the rise, regardless of political hurdles, but that the quality of those targets is low. Globally, nearly one-third of companies with net-zero targets failed to release an accompanying roadmap or plan for implementation.

Eating the Cost: On Friday, the True Animal Protein Price (TAPP) Coalition discussed the Belém declaration on agri-food greenhouse gas pricing. According to TAPP, the meat and dairy industry is responsible for 60% of food-based greenhouse gas emissions. This declaration, signed by 28 African nations and small Pacific islands, asks 30 OECD countries and China to reduce animal agriculture emissions through “harmonized” greenhouse gas pricing, which could involve taxes on meat or dairy, tariffs on imports, or cap-and-trade emission schemes. The declaration also urges countries to channel 20% to 50% of revenues from animal agriculture-based greenhouse gas pricing into the UNFCCC fund for responding to loss and damage and requests a new framework to continue negotiations on agriculture at future COPs.

The first thing you notice about the electric school bus is what you don't hear: engine noise. A low humming noise is all you might hear as the bus goes down the road. It makes it easier for driver Luther Somerville to hear what's going on inside the bus, too: kids beware.

""I hear a lot more now, hear 'em better. Before with the engine going, you could hear but you couldn't understand,"" Somerville said.

District leaders started looking at electric buses three years ago. And when they realized the incentives made the vehicles less expensive than gas buses, the district went all in.

""We sort of felt like, if we're gonna do this and we believe in it, why wouldn't we do it all at once and not have multiple implementations? Just rip the BAND-AID. Do it once,"" Associate Superintendent Angie Smith said.

ComEd presented the district with a check for $930,000: a rebate for going electric. And the district got other incentives, including $5 million from the federal Environmental Protection Agency to put in charging stations. Electric buses typically cost twice as much as gas buses. But the incentives brought the price down by more than half.

""It's a big step forward, and I think that speaks to the school district to bring clean, quiet and cost effective technology to the students and community,"" said Joshua Williams, with Highland Electric Fleet.

Electric vehicles mean no emissions, and no gas stations. The batteries have a range of up to 100 miles before they need to be recharged. That's enough for some bus routes, but the district will still have plenty of gas buses for the longer runs.

Those on the electric buses will need to be on time in the morning.

""That's one of the biggest challenges the students will have to get used to. They won't hear the school bus coming down the road,"" District 129 Transportation Director Brandy Kackert said.

America needs a National Astroelectricity Energy Security Transition Policy

This article builds on my previous article here, “Astroelectricity: America’s national energy security imperative”. In this article, I explain why the Trump Administration—specifically, the National Space(faring) Council under the leadership of Vice President JD Vance—should formulate a National Astroelectricity Energy Security Transition Policy to guide America in undertaking an orderly transition to space solar power-supplied astroelectricity. I also propose a presidential executive order that would task the National Space(faring) Council to prepare such a policy for presidential approval.

Addressing America’s hidden energy security crisis

When was the last time that a prominent national leader discussing energy mentioned that 80% of the energy Americans use comes from fossil carbon fuels while emphasizing that these were non-sustainable and questioning how long these would remain plentiful and affordable? Having been intently focused on America’s energy security for most of the last two decades, I cannot recall a single instance. Instead, the often-intense public rhetoric focuses on climate change, global warming, and the price of gasoline. This lack of forthrightness by our national leaders has deeply buried any public concerns about the consequences of the inevitability that America’s production of these vital fuels will peak and then begin to decline. Unless America aggressively undertakes an orderly transition to sustainable energy, America will economically falter, permanently. With history as a clear guide, warfare will follow just as happened when America first became oil insecure in the early 1970s.

Unless America aggressively undertakes an orderly transition to sustainable energy, America will economically falter, permanently.

I applaud President Trump prioritizing returning America to being energy secure as part of his administration’s “Make America Great Again” agenda. Yet, being built on a foundation of diminishing fossil carbon fuel resources, for MAGA to persist, America must become permanently energy secure using only sustainable energy. For this to happen, the starting point is to formalize a presidential policy firmly establishing how and by when America will undertake an orderly transition to practicable sustainable energy.

America’s remaining technically recoverable oil and natural gas resources

How much oil and natural gas remains in America’s “national gas tank”

The following maps illustrate where coal, oil, and natural gas can be found in the contiguous US. These fossil carbon fuel deposits were created hundreds of millions of years ago when the climate favored robust plant growth. By good fortune, America was established on a continent rich in these fuels that at the time of its founding were inconsequential for an agrarian economy but were vital for America’s transition, then unforeseen, over the next two centuries into an industrial powerhouse and global Great Power.

Figure 1: The upper map shows the locations of coal resources in the US. The different colors represent different qualities of coal in terms of pure carbon content. Generally, this indicates different, often overlapping, deeply buried geological formations. The lower map shows where oil and gas wells have been drilled in and around the US. Many of these wells were exploration wells.

The US Geological Survey (USGS) was established in 1879 to identify and locate natural resources, such as fossil carbon fuels, to enable the federal government to understand where and to what extent economically vital natural resources could be used. Periodically, the USGS publishes its estimate of the extent of the remaining in situ resources that are deemed “technically recoverable.” This means the amount that can be brought to market, regardless of cost, using available technological means and within permitted recovery parameters (e.g., legal restrictions.) For federal energy security planning purposes, this USGS estimate is the best available.

As of January 1, 2020, the USGS estimated that the US had nearly 896 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) of “technically recoverable” crude oil and natural gas. The estimated values are shown in the following table.

Figure 2: Table showing the remaining US technically recoverable crude oil and dry natural gas resources as of January 1, 2020.

The total amounts for oil and natural gas are the sum of two values. The first is the “proved reserves” in clearly identified oil and gas fields with solid estimates of how much oil and gas can be recovered. These values come from the oil companies controlling the producing fields where they have used test wells, as well as producing wells, to estimate how much oil and natural gas will likely be recovered with high confidence—hence the name “proved”. These estimates are used to establish a valuation of the resources under their control and negotiate future delivery contracts.

Essentially, America’s gas tank would be empty around the year 2100!

As the name implies, the “unproved resources” are simply the best guesses by the USGS of how much additional oil and natural gas would be expected to be produced nationally, beyond the proved resources, based on geological similarity and proximity to proven fields. Of the 896 billion BOE total, 85% is unproved resources. Thus, while there is high confidence in 15% of the total, the majority of what underpins America’s current “on paper” energy security is just a USGS best guess.

The timeline for America’s needed transition to sustainable energy

As shown in the above figure, the US consumed 12 billion BOE of oil and natural gas in 2019. These two fuels supply about 70 percent of the total energy Americans now use. Thus, continued robust oil and natural gas, at affordable prices, is clearly vital to America’s energy security.

America’s economy was quite robust in 2019, prior to the start of the economic disruption beginning in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. With the further economic sluggishness that persisted since 2020 until very recently, the combined 12 billion BOE is a good planning estimate for how much oil and natural gas America’s economy needs annually, as a minimum, to remain prosperous.

Imagine that the entirety of the nearly 900 billion BOE of US oil and natural gas resources has been located and identified as proved reserves. This is what remains in the “national gas tank,” so to speak, to keep America energy secure and prosperous. At the annual drawdown rate of 12 billion BOE, the nearly 900 billion BOE would be exhausted in only about 75 years. Essentially, America’s gas tank would be empty around the year 2100!

While this is a crude way of estimating how long US domestic oil and natural gas resources will last—given that 85% of the total has yet to be proven—it is the best “formal” federal estimate available to establish a planning timeline for America’s unavoidable transition to sustainable energy. Therefore, around the end of this century, and likely earlier with substantial net exports of American oil and natural gas or increased energy demand from AI and/or population growth, the general use of fossil oil and natural gas will end in America. Since most children alive today—the inheritors of our energy security planning wisdom—will live to see that happen, we have a clear moral obligation to make this transition happen successfully.

Finally, it is important to recognize that the need to begin an orderly transition to sustainable energy is far sooner than 2100. In the decades ahead—no one now knows exactly when—the domestic production of oil and natural gas will peak and begin to decline below domestic needs just as first happened in the 1970s. Without new sustainable replacement energy sources coming online by that time, America will again become energy insecure and need to import oil and natural gas. To avoid a return to the dangers of energy insecurity, America urgently needs a formal sustainable energy transition policy.

Astroelectricity is America’s only practicable primary future source of sustainable energy

Narrowing America’s options to one—astroelectricity

My preceding article summarized the results of my recently released “Assessment of US sustainable energy needs and transition options”. In that assessment, I began by narrowing the potentially scalable transition options to four: wind power, ground solar power, nuclear fission power, and space solar power (SSP)-supplied astroelectricity.

Figure 3: Three of the four scalable options for supplying America with sustainable energy are not practicable options for America to pursue.

As discussed in my previous article, no combination of wind power and/or ground solar power provides a practicable solution. Wind power alone or in combination with ground solar power would require coast-to-coast wind farms while ground solar power alone or in combination with wind power would require a massive takeover of agricultural land to build the solar farms. Further, their unpredictable intermittency also prevents these options from being practicable solutions, “able to be put in practice successfully.”

Until there is a demonstrated breakthrough in a new form of clean terrestrial energy generation, this leaves astroelectricity as America’s only practicable path to become and remain permanently energy secure.

The nuclear fission power solution—once again the favored choice of the US Department of Energy—is also an unwise solution as a general energy option to replace fossil carbon fuels. This is due to issues that include the need for massive fissile fuel breeding; real concerns about enabling nuclear weapon proliferation; limited plant siting locations due to natural hazards (e.g., earthquakes, floods); very real threats of terrorist, electromagnetic pulse (EMP), and hacking attacks; the lack of approved permanent nuclear waste storage; and, the impracticability of handling a steadily increasing number of decommissioned, highly-radioactive reactors.

Figure 4: Baseline five-gigawatt (GW) space solar power concept showing the SSP platform in geostationary Earth orbit transmitting power via radio waves to the ground astroelectric plant containing the receiving antennas (rectenna) that convert the transmitted power into useful baseload electrical power.

Until there is a demonstrated breakthrough in a new form of clean terrestrial energy generation (e.g., practicable nuclear fusion power), this leaves developing SSP-supplied astroelectricity as America’s only practicable path to become and remain permanently energy secure. Thus, a presidential National Astroelectricity Energy Security Transition Policy is needed now.

The scale of astroelectricity needed to remain energy secure

Figure 5: Wind and ground solar photovoltaic farms. (Commercial image, used as permitted.)

A key part of my assessment was estimating the scale of what it will take for America to “go clean.” While needing to know this is obviously required to map out an orderly transition, rarely, if ever, has the magnitude of needed new sustainable energy generation capacity been mentioned in public. Instead, political posturing and usually inaccurate reporting have profoundly misled the American public to believe that a random smattering of wind and ground solar farms will make America’s transition to clean energy practicable and quick.

Figure 6: History of US energy use from 1850 to 2023 with projection to 2100 incorporating an orderly transition to primarily astroelectricity.

The chart above shows America’s historical use of energy, by source, as a percentage of the total energy used as well as a future involving an orderly transition to using only non-fossil carbon fuels by 2100. For this sustainable energy transition planning discussion, the initial phase-in of the primary electrical power supplied by the astroelectric plants notionally begins in 2045, presumably around when domestic oil and natural gas production would peak. From 2045 onward, an increasing supply of clean primary electrical power from the astroelectric plants would make up for reductions in oil and natural gas supplies. (Of course, hydroelectricity, geothermal electricity, and some biomass would likely still be used. However, because these are limited in scalable generation capacity compared to the total need, they are ignored in this top-level discussion.)

The table below shows what I estimate to be the total primary continuous electrical power that America would have needed to have already transitioned entirely in 2019 to sustainable energy. America would have needed 5,424 gigawatts of continuous (GWc) baseload electrical power. Putting the magnitude of America’s needed new clean energy infrastructure into perspective, it is equal to the generating capacity of 2,712 two-gigawatt Hoover Dams operating continuously. (For comparison, America now has around 80 GWc of nuclear fission power and less than 30 GWc of hydroelectric power.)

Figure 7: Amount of equivalent continuous electrical power (GWc) and the equivalent number of Hoover Dams operating continuously that America would have needed in 2019 to have already transitioned to sustainable energy.

I assume that SSP platforms will supply 80% of the needed 5,424 GWc. This significantly minimizes the land area within the contiguous US that must be used. However, this will require that around 900 five-gigawatt SSP platforms be built in geostationary Earth orbit by 2100. From 2045 to 2100, an average of around 16 of the SSP platforms must become operational each year for America to remain energy secure. Given the immensity of this undertaking, certainly this is an energy security crisis warranting presidential action beginning with a well-developed National Astroelectricity Energy Security Transition Policy,

Figure 8: Comparison of the total land area needed for using only ground solar farms and using just the astroelectric plants to meet the total sustainable energy need of 5,424 GWc of primary electrical power.

Summarizing my concerns in a message to the president

Prior to the publication of my previous article, I sent the following to President Trump with copies to Vice President Vance and the Secretary of Energy, the Honorable Chris Wright:

Dear Mr. President,

As a Professional Engineer (PE) with a deep commitment to America’s energy security, I urge your administration to develop and implement a National Astroelectricity Energy Security Transition Policy that will keep America permanently energy secure and energy independent once America’s use of fossil carbon fuels ends.

Your January 20, 2025, Executive Order, “Declaring a National Energy Emergency”, was a needed first step to restore America’s energy security by increasing the domestic supply of energy. However, the underlying threat to America’s energy security remains: the fact that 80 percent of the energy we use still comes from non-sustainable fossil carbon fuels with oil and natural gas accounting for about 70 percent of the total we use. According to January 1, 2020, Government estimates, the US only has about a 75-year technically recoverable supply of these two fuels at the 2019 consumption rate. Hence, without a successful transition to sustainable energy—for which no plan now exists!—America will inevitably, once again, become dangerously energy insecure. It is vital that the Federal Government decisively act to prevent this from happening.

Since 2008, I have extensively studied America’s energy needs and the sustainable energy options America could use to replace fossil carbon fuels with clean electricity and clean carbon fuels. To permanently become sustainable energy secure, while keeping America economically prosperous and at peace, the US would need a new primary sustainable electrical energy supply equivalent to roughly 2,500 Hoover Dams operating continuously.

At this scale needed to replace fossil fuels, my research shows that NO terrestrial sustainable energy sources (including wind power, ground solar power, and nuclear fission power) are practicable replacements. This leaves only space solar power (SSP)-supplied astroelectricity as the primary means for America to become permanently energy secure.

To supply astroelectricity, the US needs nearly 900 Manhattan Island-size solar energy collection platforms in Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO). Each of these will transmit 5 gigawatts (GW) of collected solar power via radio waves to its ground astroelectric plant. This astroelectricity will then be used by local utilities to dispatch power to their customers and used to synthesize clean carbon fuels (e.g., gasoline and synthetic methane) and industrial feedstocks (e.g., plastics) from captured CO2 and clean hydrogen to fully replace fossil carbon fuels. With this approach, the transition to sustainable energy will be seamless and orderly. Also, these clean carbon fuels will NOT add any net CO2 to the atmosphere.

It is imperative that the initial GEO SSP systems and ground astroelectric plants be constructed and operating before fracked oil and natural gas production peaks in the coming decades. Achieving this will require establishing a substantial new American human spacefaring enterprise stretching throughout the central solar system to construct and operate those systems. For this transition to be successful, the development of SSP must be prioritized as a national energy security imperative, serving as the cornerstone of a now needed National Astroelectricity Energy Security Transition Policy.

My proposed presidential executive order

To build the needed astroelectricity-based clean energy infrastructure and be ready to begin successful initial operations when domestic supplies of oil and natural gas begin to decline, decisive presidential action is needed now. America needs a wartime-equivalent spacefaring industrialization plan to create the substantial American commercial human spacefaring industrial enterprise that will build and operate the nearly 900 SSP systems needed. In parallel, America needs a terrestrial sustainable energy development plan that will build the equally substantial terrestrial sustainable energy infrastructure to convert the transmitted astroelectricity into robust supplies of clean dispatchable electricity, fuels, and industrial feedstocks keeping America’s economy “well fed” and Americans prosperous and energy secure throughout the transition and beyond.

Preceding these plans is the need for a presidential National Astroelectricity Energy Security Transition Policy identifying the specific objectives to be accomplished; delegating these to the implementing federal government departments, agencies, and non-governmental organizations; and, communicating these efforts to Congress as proposed legislative changes and authorized expenditures. Triggering the creation of this policy would be a detailed presidential executive order, such as the one I propose in the following:

EXECUTIVE ORDER DECLARING A NATIONAL SUSTAINABLE ENERGY SECURITY EMERGENCY AND DIRECTING THE CREATION OF A NATIONAL ASTROELECTRICITY ENERGY SECURITY TRANSITION POLICY TO INITIATE AND GUIDE AMERICA’S TRANSITION TO SUSTAINABLE ENERGY

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

Section 1. Purpose and Findings.

A. The energy security of the United States is critically threatened by an inadequate long-term sustainable energy supply. Despite the current abundance of domestic oil and natural gas, America's long-term energy security is uncertain because current attempts to replace fossil carbon fuels with sustainable energy are failing. Fossil carbon fuels are non-renewable, and it is only a matter of time before domestic supplies of oil and natural gas—vital to America’s economy—begin to become scarce, risking a return to America’s energy security-driven geopolitical turmoil that beleaguered America for much of the last half-century.

B. America must immediately begin to plan an orderly transition to practicable sources of abundant, all-year reliable sustainable energy. The complexity of America's energy use requires a substantially new sustainable energy infrastructure that supplies baseload and dispatchable electrical power, sustainable carbon fuels, and sustainable carbon-based industrial feedstocks. To prevent economic disruption and foster public acceptance, this transition must be seamless and non-burdensome to the end users of energy and energy-related products.

C. Current scalable terrestrial sustainable energy options are insufficient to enable America to permanently become energy secure with abundant sustainable energy. To replace fossil carbon fuels, the United States needs over 5,400 gigawatts (GW) of baseload primary electrical power generation capacity to supply needed dispatchable electrical power and synthesize sustainable fuels and industrial feedstocks. For perspective, this is equivalent to over 2,700 2-GW Hoover Dams operating continuously. The scope of the needed new American sustainable energy infrastructure is the first element justifying designating this as a national emergency.

D. Terrestrial intermittent sources, such as wind and ground solar power, are impracticable at the scale required. A coast-to-coast forest of immense wind turbines would still be insufficient to meet US energy needs. Ground solar photovoltaic farms alone would require dedicating over one million square kilometers (about 14% of the contiguous US) to solar farms. Further, neither can supply the baseload primary power needed throughout the year for a reliably functioning national energy infrastructure.

E. Nuclear fission power faces substantial scale-up hurdles. A substantial expansion sufficient to replace fossil carbon fuels raises scale-up concerns regarding fissile fuel breeding, waste disposal, and the necessity to build and decommission thousands of reactors. While the limited use of nuclear fission power could be continued as part of assuring energy redundancy during emergencies, its use shall be consistent with demonstrated nuclear power plant safety assurances, local environmental protection, protections against nuclear weapon proliferation, protections from natural and other security threats to the nuclear plants and American public, Congressional approval of permanent acceptable nuclear waste disposal capabilities and nuclear plant decommissioning regulations, and adequate sources of fissile fuels not enabling nuclear weapon proliferation.

F. The development of practicable commercial nuclear fusion power generation will continue with a goal of achieving a baseload electrical power generation capability to replace existing nuclear fission power plants and augment astroelectric plants. However, considerations noted earlier regarding safety, threats, nuclear weapon proliferation, waste disposal, et cetera, shall be fully addressed in these development efforts for nuclear fusion power to become a true sustainable energy source.

G. Research into nuclear fission power and nuclear fusion power for off-world use, including advanced space propulsion, will continue.

H. Space Solar Power (SSP)-supplied astroelectricity will be presumed to become America’s primary source of baseload power feeding America’s clean energy infrastructure. Only SSP-supplied astroelectricity now provides America with an orderly path to transition this century to the abundant sustainable energy needed to replace fossil carbon fuels. Extensive studies undertaken by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the US Department of Energy, and industry in the late 1970s and early 1980s found that SSP is technologically feasible. On this basis, with good confidence and exploiting nearly a half-century of further aerospace technological advances, the United States can initiate the development of SSP-related extraterrestrial and terrestrial capabilities leading to the construction of prototype SSP systems as the first step to the operational deployment of SSP.

I. Despite now having immense remaining in situ technically recoverable fossil carbon fuels, for planning purposes, a complete transition from these vital but non-sustainable energy sources to primarily astroelectricity will be assumed to be needed by 2100.

J. To prevent America again becoming energy insecure, the initial supply of sustainable electrical power from the astroelectric plants must be available no later than when domestic production of oil and natural gas begins to decline in the coming decades. The clear national energy security need to avoid becoming energy insecure again is a second element justifying undertaking this transition as a national emergency.

K. To pursue the development of SSP, America must quickly and fully transition from the current era of limited human space exploration to that of a robust commercial human spacefaring nation operating routinely and safely throughout the central solar system. It is anticipated that thousands of Americans will be working off-world in the coming decades to bring SSP online. Of course, human space exploration (e.g., exploring Mars), led by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), will continue, but this shall be an adjunct to the priority of commercializing America’s human spacefaring enterprise to develop SSP.

Section 2. Definitions and guidance.

A. The term “space solar power” (SSP) means sunlight converted into useful electrical power in space and transmitted via electromagnetic (EM) radiation (radio waves or lasers) to ground receiving stations or to other locations in space for use as a power source.

B. The term “SSP platform” means orbiting systems used to convert sunlight into useful electrical power and transmit this power to the ground receiving stations or to other locations in space for use as a power source.

C. The term “astroelectricity” is the name of the electrical power supplied by the SSP-transmitted EM radiation after having been converted into alternating or direct current electrical power.

D. The term ‘‘sustainable (clean) energy infrastructure’’ means the fully integrated system required to replace fossil carbon fuels with sustainable (clean) electrical power, fuels, and industrial feedstocks.

E. The term ‘‘astroelectric plant’’ means a ground receiving station (rectenna farm) used primarily to collect SSP-transmitted EM radiation, convert it into usable astroelectricity, and supply this to the nation’s power grid.

F. The term ‘‘energy supply’’ means the production, transportation, refining, and generation of electricity, fuels, and energy produced industrial feedstocks.

G. The term “spaceworthiness” defines a condition of acceptable operational safety of human space flight systems consistent with and comparable to airworthiness. Spaceworthiness shall be essential for all government and commercial human extraterrestrial transportation systems (e.g., spaceplanes and spaceships) and accommodations (e.g., space stations and space habitats) used by crew, passengers, workers, and guests.

H. The term “spaceworthiness certification” will be an independent means to establish spaceworthiness consistent with and comparable to that undertaken by commercial and military airworthiness certification. Spaceworthiness certification shall be required for all transatmospheric and exoplanetary systems and accommodations used by governmental personnel, commercial operators and crew, and the public, and where the safety of the non-involved public is at a non-remote risk. The imposition of spaceworthiness certification recognizes that for America to successfully become a true human spacefaring nation, the Government’s ethical “duty to care” obligation to ensure the safety of Americans must be met. Military and commercial airworthiness certification protocols have clearly demonstrated that this is the best available means of achieving and maintaining acceptable operational safety and correcting deficiencies that do occur. Logically, the extension and expansion of the airworthiness certification protocols into all aspects of America’s emerging human spacefaring enterprise is warranted. Consequently, federal military and commercial spaceworthiness certification shall replace all other human safety assurance methods and approvals and shall be used for future planning purposes other than those uniquely used only by NASA astronauts.

I. The term “astrologistics” refers to logistics undertaken to transport, deploy, house, sustain, maintain, and provide emergency services to enable Americans to undertake commercial and non-NASA governmental human operations in outer space.

Section 3. Presumptions.

A. For planning purposes, the presumption is that SSP-supplied astroelectricity will provide 80 percent of the total dispatched electrical power and synthetic fuels and industrial feedstocks needed by the US by 2100. The remaining 20 percent by 2100 will come from existing hydroelectric and geothermal-electric sources, biomass energy systems, nuclear fission power plants rebuilt using new modular reactors, and ground solar photovoltaic farms integrated into the rectenna arrays of the astroelectric plants.

B. For planning purposes, 900 5-GW SSP platforms and ground receiving stations (astroelectric plants) within the contiguous US will be needed by 2100.

C. By the year 2100, it will be assumed that existing wind farms, ground solar farms, and nuclear fission power plants not being updated will have been decommissioned due to age.

D. The use of passive solar energy and building roof-top solar power systems will be assumed to be incorporated into new national building codes focused on reducing per person energy use consistent with the objective of a seamless and non-burdensome national transition to sustainable energy.

Section 4. National Spacefaring Council tasking.

A. Under the direction of the Vice President, the National Space Council—hereby redesignated as the National Spacefaring Council—shall prepare a draft National Astroelectricity Energy Security Transition Policy for presidential approval. This policy shall identify and address all aspects of America’s transition to using SSP-supplied astroelectricity as the primary source of sustainable energy.

B. The National Spacefaring Council will coordinate its efforts with the National Security Council to ensure that all requirements related to America’s national security are fully addressed during, and subsequent to, America’s transition to sustainable energy.

C. Following presidential approval, the National Spacefaring Council will coordinate the preparation of proposed legislation authorizing, regulating, and funding efforts of the Federal Government and interstate (interplanetary) commerce required to implement the federal responsibilities and taskings identified by the policy.

Section 5. National Astroelectricity Energy Security Transition Policy development.

A. Due to the importance of energy use throughout America’s economy, the policy will be comprehensive in nature, essentially becoming an “all of America” roadmap for America’s sustainable energy transition.

B. The policy shall specifically incorporate the term “astroelectricity” in its name to retain its focus on utilizing SSP-supplied astroelectricity as the primary means for America to undertake an orderly transition to practicable sustainable energy.

C. The policy will be divided into an extraterrestrial segment, a terrestrial segment, a foreign affairs segment, and an interface segment. (1) The extraterrestrial segment shall address all national needs—governmental and commercial—related to human and robotic spacefaring operations enabling and supporting the off-planet commercial SSP industry. The extraterrestrial segment shall plan the formation of the American commercial and governmental spacefaring operations required to research, develop, resource explore, extract needed extraterrestrial resources, manufacture, construct, deploy, operate, maintain, defend, and protect America’s SSP energy supply. Annexes to the extraterrestrial segment shall:

(a) Identify the responsibilities of the Department of War to protect and defend its own and other governmental and commercial human spacefaring operations throughout the central solar system.

(b) Identify the responsibilities of the Department of Homeland Security for the operation of a “Space Guard” to undertake law enforcement and other Coast Guard-like responsibilities off-planet consistent with protecting America’s vital interests.

(c) Identify the responsibilities of the Departments of Commerce, Transportation, and War to establish a national astrologistical infrastructure to enable routine, robust, and operationally safe governmental and commercial human spacefaring operations throughout the central solar system.

(d) Include a coordinated strategy by the Departments of Transportation and War to establish military and commercial spaceworthiness certification.

(2) The terrestrial segment shall address all national needs—governmental and commercial—for developing, deploying, and operating the ground portion of the new sustainable energy infrastructure. This will include the astroelectric plants to receive and deliver the imported astroelectricity, the electrical power transmission infrastructure to deliver clean electrical power, and the synthetic fuels and industrial feedstock plants that will use this clean electrical power to supply carbon dioxide (CO2)-neutral carbon fuels and industrial feedstocks. Annexes to the terrestrial segment shall:

(a) Identify specific responsibilities of federal departments and agencies for planning and implementing the terrestrial segment.

(b) Include an idealized optimistic representation/visualization of what a 22nd century America, powered completely by sustainable energy, could look like to familiarize Americans with the full benefits of “going clean”.

(c) Include an economic analysis assessing the cost-effectiveness of reducing America’s current per person energy use by one-half by rebuilding most of America using new technology-enabled 22nd century energy efficiency technologies. The analysis should assess the benefits to be realized by replacing most non-historic 19th and 20th century housing, businesses, schools, and transportation infrastructure to improve America’s overall standard of living while also maintaining an individual’s lifestyle choices (e.g., urban, suburban, and rural).

(3) The foreign affairs segment shall address extending the clean energy security benefits of using SSP to America’s allies and other non-adversarial nations who wish to join with America in transitioning to SSP-supplied astroelectricity. An important facet of this effort is to enable the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals requiring clean and plentiful energy to be achieved worldwide, thereby fostering global peace, prosperity, and joint security.

(4) The interface segment shall identify, coordinate, and track the three separate segments to ensure a wholly coordinated/integrated effort. A product of the interface segment shall be a national report card tracking progress and reporting challenges remaining for America to “go clean” by the year 2100. An annex to the interface segment shall identify a roadmap for maximizing the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) to enable and minimize the cost of America transitioning to sustainable energy.

Conclusion

A century ago, the farsighted pioneering Russian space scientist and philosopher, Konstantin Eduardovich Tsiolkovsky, wrote “Sixteen Stages of Space Exploration”. He wrote: “Mankind will not forever remain on Earth but, in the pursuit of light and space, will first timidly emerge from the bounds of the atmosphere and then advance until he has conquered the whole of circumsolar space.”

It is imperative that the initial GEO SSP systems and ground astroelectric plants be constructed and operating before fracked oil and natural gas production peaks in the coming decades.

We have now progressed through the first ten stages. Stage 11 is “Using sunlight to power human habitats, propel spacecraft, grow food, and meet humanity’s growing need for sustainable energy” per the modernized version of his writing. With the “Age of Fossil Fuels” ending, the time to undertake Stage 11 has arrived.

Returning America to being energy secure has proven to be a critical step in President Trump’s goal to “Make America Great Again” while also advancing world peace. Developing astroelectricity to make America permanently energy secure will “seal the deal” Trump made with the American people to ensure that America remains free, prosperous, and at peace.

The message at COP 30 this year is that countries in the global south are tired of all the platitudes and empty promises being shoveled their way every year at these international confabs. And so, they are making plans to chart their own course forward instead of waiting for others to act. “Africa is no longer the ‘terrain of aid’ but the front line of solutions” in areas like renewable energy, said Carlos Lopes, the special envoy for Africa for the president of COP30.

Give someone a fish and they will eat for a day. Teach them how to fish and they can feed themselves forever. That axiom is appropriate in the context of renewable energy in Africa. Chinese-made panels have jumpstarted the renewable energy revolution in Africa, according to a report in Japan Times. But African climate leaders say the continent, which holds more than 30 percent of the world’s critical minerals, should be an industrial actor — not an importer — in the clean energy transition.

Between June 2024 and June 2025, Nigeria imported about 1,721 MW of solar panels from China, making it the second largest importer in Africa after South Africa, according to data from the energy think tank Ember. China supplied about 60 percent of Africa’s solar imports during the same period, the report said.

Carlos Lopes said money spent on importing panels, turbines, and software could be used to fund African clean energy design labs and create regional research hubs where local engineers could adapt foreign technology.

The most recent example of how this works is automobile manufacturing in China. More than 20 years ago, US and European companies were mesmerized at the prospect of selling millions of cars to Chinese customers. The kicker was that China required those companies to form joint ventures with Chinese companies.

That led to a massive transfer of knowledge to those Chinese companies, who soon learned how to build cars, trucks, and buses, better, faster, and cheaper than the western companies they were allied with. As a result, Chinese workers are now building cars for local consumption and export domestically and keeping the profits in the country. Africa wants to do much the same thing with solar and and other renewables.

Africa Rising

Countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo, which has more than 70 percent of the world’s cobalt reserves, Zimbabwe, which has massive lithium supplies, and Gabon, with its manganese resources, should not only be exporting raw materials but building technologies locally. “When processing happens where the minerals lie, jobs stay, emissions drop, and dignity grows,” Lopes said.

Several African countries are making that transition, including Morocco, South Africa, and Egypt. All of them are ramping up production with solar assembly plants and manufacturing facilities. Egypt is developing three manufacturing plants in collaboration with several Asian cleantech companies, including a Singaporean manufacturer, EliTe Solar, which is set to start a 3-gigawatt facility this year. In October, Nigeria signed a deal with Chinese solar PV manufacturer LONGi to build a 500 to 1,000 megawatt solar panel production factory in that country.

Just as with western automakers in China, the wheel now has turned as African enterprises learn to lean into solar manufacturing. China’s dominance in solar manufacturing is not going away any time soon. After decades of investment that have led to low production costs and a skilled workforce, China is the big dog in renewable energy, and that is not about to change.

But there are opportunities for Africa to insert itself into the solar manufacturing space according to Dave Jones, energy analyst and co-founder of Ember Energy in the UK. By importing Chinese battery cells but assembling other components locally, manufacturers can keep 60 percent of the value chain within their economy. “The cells cost about 40 percent of a panel’s price. So if you’re able to manufacture and do the panel assembly, you’re saving over half and keeping half of that value within the country,” he said.

Salpha Energy Growing In Nigeria

One of the companies that is making that happen is Salpha Energy in Nigeria, which manufactures solar systems and electrically operated consumer products like fans and residential energy storage devices in a factory in the city of Calabar near the southern coast of the country. On its website, it says, “The clean energy era isn’t a distant dream; it’s happening now, and it’s our partners who are making it real. Distributors who take light to the edges of the map. Investors who don’t just fund, but believe. Together, we’re not just talking about a sustainable future — we’re building it.”

In its factory, dozens of young technicians swarm around a production line, picking out solar-powered batteries, fans, and lamps to test for quality. They package the tested products for shipment from Salpha Energy’s solar assembly plant to customers throughout the West African country.

“I can see the same pride I see on the faces of engineers in factories in Tokyo and the United States, where they build things,” said Salpha Energy’s founder, Sandra Chukwudozie. “Except now it’s happening here at home.” That’s a beautiful thing, when you think about it.

She said the assembly plant is a testament to Africa’s ability to produce its green technologies and even export them, as it did last year to Ghana. “We shipped out some batches of our products to Accra — by road,” says Chukwudozie. “For us, it was just to test this idea of Africa-led exports. It carries the Made in Nigeria stamp, and we can sell that across West Africa.”

Since starting up in 2017, Salpha Energy has made solar power systems for more than 2 million Nigerian homes and businesses, and it aims to assemble up to 300,000 units a year, she said. Salpha Energy is part of the green leadership in Nigeria, and the continent overall. African representatives attending COP30 in Brazil are keen to showcase and promote Nigeria’s manufacturing prowess on the global stage.

Renewables In Nigeria

Nigeria has a plan to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels and generate 30 percent of its electricity from renewables by 2030 while developing local manufacturing capacity. Its national grid is now powered 75 percent by gas and 20 percent by hydropower. Other clean energy sources like solar, wind, and biomass account for less than 2 percent.

One intriguing possibility is that much of Nigeria could skip right over building out a national energy grid just as many African countries bypassed a telephone network composed of wires and went straight to cell phones.

That is not to say that energy grids will not be important in cities, but large portions of Nigeria are quite rural and are not serviced by an electrical grid at all. They are ideal candidates for distributed energy resources composed of microgrids and virtual power plants. In March, Nigeria signed a $200 million agreement with the World Bank and other partners to develop solar grids in rural areas as part of its efforts to meet its renewable energy targets.

Is Africa a renewable energy manufacturing powerhouse? Not yet, but it is moving in the right direction, due in part to the transfer of expertise to local companies by Chinese companies. That transfer of information and technology is an inevitable part of a global commerce system. To the extent that African countries can leverage that transfer, they will be better able to chart their own course to a sustainable future, rather than waiting on others to do it for them.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Salpha-Energy.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 00:58:28.006756

“Today’s launch of Toyota’s first U.S. battery plant and additional U.S. investment up to $10 billion marks a pivotal moment in our company’s history,” said Ted Ogawa, president and chief executive officer, Toyota Motor North America (TMNA). “Toyota is a pioneer in electrified vehicles, and the company’s significant manufacturing investment in the U.S. and North Carolina further solidifies our commitment to team members, customers, dealers, communities, and suppliers.”

United States Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy expressed support for manufacturing investments in the U.S., noting that Toyota North Carolina’s investment of nearly $14 billion and the creation of more than 5,000 new jobs marks a turning point for the Piedmont Triad region.

“Under President Donald Trump’s leadership, America is open for business,” said U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy. “Toyota’s move to expand production in North Carolina is the latest show of confidence in this administration’s efforts to reshore manufacturing, generate new, great paying jobs, and inject billions of dollars into the economy. We’re just getting started!”

The 1,850-acre mega site can produce 30 GWh annually at full capacity. It will serve as Toyota’s hub for developing and producing lithium-ion batteries needed for its ever-growing portfolio of electrified vehicles. The state-of-the-art plant will house 14 battery production lines supporting hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), making it a historical investment for Toyota and a substantial economic impact on the Tarheel State.

“Today marks a historic milestone as Toyota begins battery production right here in North Carolina,” said Governor Josh Stein. “This groundbreaking investment will create more than 5,000 new jobs for North Carolinians and will strengthen our commitment to leading the way in both the automotive supply chain and the clean energy economy.”

Everyday items like cleaning products, candles and furniture can release harmful chemicals like formaldehyde, which poses a serious health risk.

The solution: At Carnegie Mellon University, National Science Foundation-funded researchers have developed a revolutionary new technology: a low-cost, long-lasting sensor to detect formaldehyde. By applying a unique polymer nano-coating, they've extended the sensor's lifespan by over 200%, making it a reliable and affordable tool for public health.

The impact: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has found that the concentrations of some pollutants can be two to five times higher indoors than outdoors. Since the average person spends about 90% of their time indoors, these pollutants can pose a greater health risk than outdoor pollution.

The new sensors enable individuals and organizations to make informed decisions about indoor air quality, helping to reduce exposure to harmful pollutants.

This same technology could be used to create more efficient and longer-lasting batteries for everything from electric cars to smartphones, or to develop sensors for industrial safety to detect dangerous gases in factories.

The letter reiterates errors in EPA’s authorization and emphasizes the impracticality and negative consequences of the 2021 SORE Amendments.
TCIA will continue to monitor the status of California’s SORE Amendments, and update members when notable developments occur.","On October 29, 2025, the Outdoor Power Equipment Institute (OPEI), joined by several organizations including the Tree Care Industry Association (TCIA), sent a letter to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin supporting OPEI’s petition for reconsideration of the EPA’s Final Rule, “California State Nonroad Engine Pollution Control Standards; Small Off-Road engines Regulations; Notice of Decision.” The letter urges the EPA to withdraw or reconsider the rule, arguing that the decision was based on several factual and procedural errors that could have major implications for manufacturers, dealers, and professional users of small-engine equipment nationwide.

Background

Under the federal Clean Air Act (CAA), states are generally preempted from setting their own nonroad engine emission standards. However, Section 209 of the CAA allows California to apply to the EPA for a waiver of federal preemption, permitting the state to enforce its own standards for certain categories of nonroad engines.

In 2021, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) adopted amendments to its Small Off-Road Engine (SORE) regulations, which govern engines under 25 horsepower. These engines power a wide range of commercial and residential equipment—including chainsaws, leaf blowers, string trimmers, lawn mowers, generators, and pressure washers—commonly used across the tree care, landscaping, construction, and maintenance industries. The 2021 SORE Amendments established a two-phase roadmap toward zero-emission standards, with a full phase-out of new gas-powered SORE engines by model year 2028.

On December 20, 2022, CARB submitted an authorization request to the EPA to allow California to enforce the 2021 SORE Amendments. On January 6, 2025, the EPA granted authorization in a Notice of Decision, allowing California to enforce the amendments.

Industry Pushback on EPA’s SORE Approval

On January 29, 2025, OPEI petitioned the EPA to reconsider its authorization, arguing that the decision rested on several key errors: disregarding manufacturer compliance-cost data, overstating the technical feasibility of zero-emission equipment, and allowing CARB to enforce portions of its program before obtaining EPA approval.

OPEI maintained that the EPA relied on retail product prices rather than manufacturer cost data, leading to an underestimation of compliance costs—industry data in the record estimated these costs upward of $1 billion. The petition also cited a December 2024 joint EPA–Department of Energy report that found commercial-grade SORE-powered equipment remains a “notable exception” to electrification trends because of limitations in battery cost, weight, and runtime—contradicting EPA’s own technical findings. Finally, OPEI noted that CARB adopted and began enforcing certain emission requirements as early as 2018, years before obtaining federal authorization, in violation of the Clean Air Act.

On February 10, 2025, OPEI filed a petition for judicial review with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Additional petitions were later filed by the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM) and the Energy Marketers of America (EMA), and the cases were consolidated. In the spring of 2025, the court paused the litigation to allow the new administration time to review the rule.

On June 9, 2025, OPEI submitted a request for an administrative stay to the EPA, asking the Agency to postpone the rule’s implementation while the petitions for reconsideration and judicial review are pending.

Letter Supporting OPEI’s Petition

TCIA, along with seven other trade associations, signed on to a letter supporting OPEI’s petition for reconsideration of the EPA’s Final Rule. The letter reiterates errors in EPA’s authorization and emphasizes the impracticality and negative consequences of the 2021 SORE Amendments.

It also explains that CARB’s SORE Amendments extend beyond lawn and garden tools: other SORE-powered equipment—such as construction equipment, pressure washers, and portable generators—will face emission-reduction requirements in the near term, with zero-emission standards enforced in 2028. The letter argues this timeline creates unreasonable expectations for manufacturers, driving unrealistic demands for rapid redesign and investment.

The letter calls on the EPA to grant OPEI’s petition for reconsideration and withdraw its authorization for the 2021 SORE Amendments, or alternatively, to submit the decision to Congress for review under the Congressional Review Act (CRA). The signatories noted that the Agency itself recently determined California waivers are subject to congressional review. Earlier in 2025, Congress used the CRA to overturn EPA’s approval of California’s Advanced Clean Trucks and Advanced Clean Cars II waivers, which would have required an increasing share of zero-emission truck and passenger-vehicle sales in future model years.

TCIA will continue to monitor the status of California’s SORE Amendments, and update members when notable developments occur.",https://treecareindustryassociation.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/epa.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 20:59:12.361597

The road ahead sounds quieter and less bumpy for Medina, who trains school bus drivers at West Aurora School District 129. In her 20 years behind the wheel, she never expected to drive an electric bus.

The district officially launched 27 zero-emission electric school buses and 28 charging stations — not like the kind of buses adults used to ride.

""It's not that much different inside except that it's way quieter and it produces a lot less emissions,"" said Dr. Angie Smith, associate superintendent for operations for the school district.

""It's completely powered by the battery that sits underneath the bus and can drive over 100 miles fully charged,"" said Joshua Williams, senior Midwest regional manager of Highland Electric Fleets. ""They're already used for daily routes.""

Highland Electric Fleets helped the district transition a third of its buses to electric, making it the biggest electric school bus fleet in the Chicago area. All thanks to federal funding and a big rebate check from ComEd.

The district says each electric vehicle was about half the price of a traditional diesel bus. The EVs will stick to shorter routes – especially as temperatures drop.

""A little bit nervous for the winter,"" Medina said.

""We do plan for cold Chicago winters, so typically, maybe worst-case scenario, they might travel 65 to 70 miles,"" Williams said.

Through the Cumberland District Energy project, ACET is determining how the water trapped in those tunnels could be used to produce geothermal energy that would heat and cool buildings.
“[The Cumberland District Energy project] is technically a very large ground-source heat exchanger,” adds Emily Smejkal, a fellow with the Victoria-based Cascade Institute who specializes in geothermal energy.
Smejkal notes that having a network of mine shafts underneath the village means the entire town could access this clean energy resource.
Using those same abandoned coal mines to produce clean energy doesn’t rewrite Cumberland’s history, Copeman says, but it does use that past to flip the script for its future.","Cumberland, B.C. was built on coal mining—both literally and practically. Thousands of workers were employed and millions of tonnes of coal were exported over 80 years before the mines were shuttered, leaving deep holes in the ground and a deeper void in the village’s economy.

Now, thanks to a partnership with the University of Victoria-led Accelerating Community Energy Transformation (ACET) initiative, Cumberland is planning for a future built on clean energy that comes from the maze of abandoned mine shafts and extraction tunnels that snake beneath its streets.

Through the Cumberland District Energy project, ACET is determining how the water trapped in those tunnels could be used to produce geothermal energy that would heat and cool buildings.

Cumberland Mayor Vickey Brown sees this project as a step toward the reimagining of Cumberland—already an attraction for nature lovers and mountain bikers—as a clean, green outdoor adventure destination. It also represents a potential shift in how longtime locals, relative newcomers and visitors alike view the village.

“This is a way to highlight the history of Cumberland and bring it into a sustainable-future, clean-energy ethos,” she says. “It’s something that old Cumberland can be proud of, because we’re using the waste of that old resource to transition to cleaner energy.”

An old asset, a new opportunity for clean energy

Here’s how it would work: water trapped underground in the abandoned mines is cooler in summer and warmer in winter than the temperature above ground, explains ACET community energy planner and project lead Zachary Gould. Taking advantage of that temperature difference, heat pumps could use the water from the abandoned mines to provide heating and cooling to buildings at a relatively low cost and with near-zero carbon output.

“[The Cumberland District Energy project] is technically a very large ground-source heat exchanger,” adds Emily Smejkal, a fellow with the Victoria-based Cascade Institute who specializes in geothermal energy.

Smejkal notes that having a network of mine shafts underneath the village means the entire town could access this clean energy resource.

To start, however, initial modelling of potential energy systems for Cumberland is focused on a proposed civic precinct redevelopment—a community centre, municipal offices, even affordable housing—and a large industrial zone closer to Comox Lake.

“It’s been a big motivation to think about this energy system in the context of how we can reduce the costs of critical infrastructure and provide critical amenities for community members,” says Gould.

“But it’s not just an energy system,” he notes. “It’s an opportunity to look at resource extraction in a new way in a village that was built on extractive principles. This project could turn those ruins of extraction, so to speak, into an opportunity and a shared community asset.”

Mining was historically the core of Cumberland community

From 1888, when the first mine opened in Cumberland, until the late 1960s, when the last one was closed, some 16 million tonnes of bituminous coal were excavated and shipped from the Comox Valley, says Dawn Copeman, a historian with Cumberland Museum and Archives. A wharf at nearby Union Bay loaded ships that were destined for international markets. Cumberland coal fueled steamships and heated homes. Coal coked in Union Bay was sold to smelters for lead and zinc production.

While the mines were the core of the local economy and community for decades, workers were exploited and their jobs were dangerous. Many miners died and many more were injured while companies sold a product whose burning contributed to climate change.

Using those same abandoned coal mines to produce clean energy doesn’t rewrite Cumberland’s history, Copeman says, but it does use that past to flip the script for its future.

Noting that a proposal in 2011 for a coal mine near Union Bay attracted “a lot of pushback,” she says. In contrast, Cumberland’s proposal to use its abandoned mines to produce geothermal heating and cooling provides a constructive opportunity.

“Being able to use something that’s already there for heating, I think it’s positive,” she says.

‘It’s about reimagining these old relics of industry’

The history of the Cumberland geothermal project started—more than 130 years after the first mine opened—as a discussion among geologists who live in the region and gather regularly.

As Cory MacNeill, a Cumberland local and geologist, recounts it, a conversation amongst peers about the common issue of methane produced by the former mines evolved into chats about other geothermal applications for abandoned coal shafts. While the widely known application of drilling deep into the Earth to access super-heated water wasn’t an option in Cumberland, accessing the water closer to the surface to offset the heat of summer and the cold of winter was.

And they had examples to follow. MacNeill notes similar projects have been established about an hour south in Nanaimo, B.C. and across the country in Springhill, N.S., another former mining town.

“It’s about reimagining these old resources and relics of industry,” he says. “It’s really powerful to look at all of this mining and look at ways that we can benefit from it from a more environmental standpoint.”

Highlighting the past while building a sustainable future

When Brown sat in on one of the geologists’ discussions, she was already aware of the Nanaimo geothermal project at Vancouver Island University and of conversations between a previous Cumberland mayor and officials in Nova Scotia about their geothermal project.

What put the pieces together for her was an ACET webinar for municipal politicians.

“They said, ‘We’re looking for projects to work with municipalities.’ And I thought, ‘I have a project.’”

She explains there are two blocks of municipal property occupied by the village office, council chambers, public works and a rec centre that sit on top of the former No. 6 mine.

“I thought we could use this project as a way to figure out whether or not we could use geothermal for heating and cooling of the buildings because we want to redevelop the block,” she says.

As a small municipality with apopulation of approximately 4,800, Cumberland doesn’t have an engineering department to study such a project. Brown saw that ACET had what the village needed.

“We need their academic expertise and their capacity to help us do those business cases, and also do the [geothermal] exploration side of it,” Brown says.

While the project was initially motivated by the desire to redevelop the municipal precinct, she says, if a pilot geothermal project proves to be successful and sustainable, there is additional potential in what Copeman calls the “vast labyrinth” of tunnels beneath the village.

Brown says providing cheap, clean heating and cooling to businesses could make Cumberland industrial land more attractive for development—especially to enterprises that produce or consume considerable amounts of heat, such as greenhouses and food processors. Drawing businesses, she says, would mean adding jobs and contributing to the tax base, all potentially making the village more livable and sustainable for its residents.

“We haven’t always worked very well with natural systems,” Brown says. “But I think this is a model of using the tools and resources you have in place to look after the needs of your community. And I think that’s far more resilient than the way we’ve done it in the past.”",https://news.uvic.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ACET_Cumberland_4_3600x1450.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 00:58:31.543713

Waters of the United States defines the scope of the Clean Water Act and which waters can be regulated with federal water quality standards.
The high court ruled in May 2023 that wetlands without a “continuous surface connection” to navigable waters did not qualify for Clean Water Act protections.
The proposed rules would further define terms like: relatively permanent, continuous surface connection and tributary.
“Clean water is under attack in America, as polluting profiteers plunder our waters — Trump’s EPA is openly aiding and abetting this destruction,” Heinzen said.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency proposed Monday new rules to define the waters of the United States, or WOTUS, protected under the Clean Water Act.

The move was celebrated by farm groups that oppose a broad interpretation of the law, while environmental groups said the rule change would end protections for millions of acres of wetlands and small streams.

Waters of the United States defines the scope of the Clean Water Act and which waters can be regulated with federal water quality standards. The WOTUS definition, which is not laid out in the Clean Water Act, has been the source of several U.S. Supreme Court cases in recent decades, most recently in Sackett v. EPA.

The high court ruled in May 2023 that wetlands without a “continuous surface connection” to navigable waters did not qualify for Clean Water Act protections. This was upheld by EPA final rules issued in August 2023, that not only applied to wetlands, but also removed the requirement that waters have a “significant nexus” to a navigable water.

Some conservative groups and lawmakers argued the 2023 EPA interpretation did not go far enough to adhere to the court’s decision in the Sackett case.

EPA’s new rules, made in conjunction with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, would “fully implement” the Sackett decision, “accelerate economic prosperity” and support the role of states and tribes in regulating their land, according to the agency’s news release.

“When finalized, the rule will cut red tape and provide predictability, consistency, and clarity for American industry, energy producers, the technology sector, farmers, ranchers, developers, businesses, and landowners for permitting under the Clean Water Act,” the EPA release said.

The proposed rules would further define terms like: relatively permanent, continuous surface connection and tributary. The rules also establish that tributaries must connect to navigable waters via features that have “consistent” and “predictable flow.”

The rules say wetlands must be “indistinguishable” from jurisdictional waters, with a “continuous surface connection.” The rules will also limit permafrost wetlands from the scope of the definition, include guidance on “wet season” water bodies, and offer exclusions on ditches, prior converted cropland, and waste treatment systems.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said the proposed rules will protect navigable waters, advance cooperative federalism and result in economic growth.

“Democrat Administrations have weaponized the definition of navigable waters to seize more power from American farmers, landowners, entrepreneurs, and families,” Zeldin said in a statement. “We heard from Americans across the country who want clean water and a clear rule. No longer should America’s landowners be forced to spend precious money hiring an attorney or consultant just to tell them whether a Water of the United States is on their property.”

According to the release, the proposed rules were formed around feedback from states, tribal nations, local governments and listening sessions.

American Farm Bureau Federation President Zippy Duvall said, in the release with EPA, the farm organization was “pleased” with the new rules.

“The Supreme Court clearly ruled several years ago that the government overreached in its interpretation of what fell under federal guidelines,” Duvall said. “We are still reviewing the entire rule, but we are pleased that it finally addresses those concerns and takes steps to provide much-needed clarity.”

The National Cattlemen’s Beef Association similarly celebrated the draft rules Monday. The association’s president and Nebraska cattleman Buck Wehrbein said the previous interpretations of the rule have meant things like “prairie potholes or dry ditches” fall under federal regulation.

“Waters of the U.S. has been a longstanding and frustrating issue for family farmers and ranchers,” he said in a statement. “Every few years, the definition of a ‘water of the U.S.’ has changed … We appreciate the EPA finally fixing previous WOTUS rules and supporting America’s family farmers and ranchers.”

Environmental groups said the newly proposed rules put habitat, drinking water and structures at greater risk.

Environmental Defense Fund’s Vice President Will McDow said EPA’s proposed rules were “not based in science, difficult to implement in practice and will create a dangerous lack of clarity.”

“This rule brings tremendous uncertainty and risk to our nation’s drinking water, flood protections and critical habitats,” McDow said in a statement.

The environmental group Food & Water Watch said the draft rules eliminate “bedrock” protections for rivers, streams, and wetlands. The group said in a news release the rules would “compound the damage” of the Sackett decision that “eliminated protections for tens of millions of acres of sensitive wetlands and small streams.”

Food & Water Watch Legal Director Tarah Heinzen said the rule “flies in the face of science and commonsense” and will lead to more pollution downstream. Wetlands, Heinzen said, offer “critical functions” in providing habitat, protecting clean water and reducing flooding.

“Clean water is under attack in America, as polluting profiteers plunder our waters — Trump’s EPA is openly aiding and abetting this destruction,” Heinzen said. “This proposed rule weakens the bedrock Clean Water Act, making it easier to fill, drain, and pollute sensitive waterways from coast to coast.”

The proposed rules will be published in the Federal Register and open for public comment for 45 days. EPA and the Army will hold two public meetings before developing final rules.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/little-walnut-creek-stock-creek-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 19:58:53.376796

A highly skilled battery manufacturing workforce provides industry stability and creates a foundation for the types of leapfrog innovations and process efficiencies that America needs.","The recent raid at Hyundai’s plant in Georgia grabbed headlines as an immigration story. This moment, however, is about more than visas or workforce enforcement: It was a destabilizing event for US clean manufacturing investment and a baffling signal to our global partners. South Korea, one of our closest allies, raised sharp concerns in response, with President Lee Jae Myung warning that “Korean companies will be very hesitant to make direct investments in the United States.”

In an apparent attempt at damage control during his trip to Asia, President Trump publicly claimed that the Hyundai raid was a “bad idea.” But rather than reassuring allies, the comment deepened confusion about who is steering US policy and reinforced the perception of chaos inside the administration—further shaking investor confidence at a critical moment for clean manufacturing.

According to the annual US Energy and Employment Report from the Department of Energy (DOE), at least 239,000 US jobs are tied to the electric vehicle (EV), battery, and charging economy—and that figure is conservative. Many more Americans, from electricians to engineers, split their work between EVs and other parts of the energy system. Yet these jobs are increasingly at risk, with General Motors recently announcing cutbacks on EV and battery production, resulting in the elimination of 1,200 jobs at a Detroit plant. By eliminating EV tax credits, slowing federal charging investments, and putting billions in promised funds in limbo, Washington is fueling uncertainty. Companies are reacting by delaying investments, scaling back production, or closing doors altogether. GM’s cutbacks in Tennessee and the collapse of battery maker Natron Energy are just two recent warning signs of a market losing confidence in America’s leadership in this space.

Every federal rollback weakens America’s foothold in the global EV marketplace. Every day of uncertainty means thousands fewer US jobs, instability for families who depend on these paychecks, and the fraying promise of the American dream for workers just entering the labor market.

Meanwhile, China is moving full speed ahead and is now responsible for more than 70 percent of global EV production. Every federal rollback weakens America’s foothold in the global EV marketplace. Every day of uncertainty means thousands fewer US jobs, instability for families who depend on these paychecks, and the fraying promise of the American dream for workers just entering the labor market. When we fall behind in the global economy, it is workers who bear the costs.

While Washington remains intent on creating chaos, states can provide stability. Forward-thinking, commonsense state policies can backstop the volatility of the current policy environment to reassure investors, attract manufacturers, relieve workers, and create family-sustaining jobs with long-term futures. State leadership can strengthen our vehicle manufacturing base. This is how America once became the country the world wanted to invest in and build in—and how we can reclaim that mantle today.

Red and blue states alike see what’s at stake. EVs and the batteries that power them are not just clean energy products—they’re an economic pillar, a job creator, and a path to lower costs for families. The competition to attract manufacturers and suppliers is fierce, but states don’t have to cut corners to win. They can draw investment without sacrificing health and safety standards, turning a blind eye to labor law enforcement, or promising rock-bottom wages.

With immigration under attack and visas increasingly out of reach, states must plug the workforce gap by growing their own talent. Foreign investors value a highly trained workforce because skilled workers deliver higher productivity, continuous innovation, and safer worksites. Investing in people is the surest way to secure the EV economy’s future—and to prove that America can lead without racing to the bottom.

To do this, states should create a dedicated system to ensure American workers can gain the specialized technical skills brought by foreign workers. European countries are doing this by bringing together employers, labor unions, and educators to set common job and training standards. When technical knowledge is spread throughout the industry’s domestic workforce and retained through collective bargaining agreements, good wages, and advancement opportunities, companies can compete on the strength of their products, technologies, and business models—not on their access to a finite pool of foreign talent. A highly skilled battery manufacturing workforce provides industry stability and creates a foundation for the types of leapfrog innovations and process efficiencies that America needs.

Investing in people is the surest way to secure the EV economy’s future—and to prove that America can lead without racing to the bottom.

States don’t even have to start from scratch. Initiatives like the EV Infrastructure Training Program already keep electricians up-to-date with changing charging technologies. With input from industry partners, labor unions, and educational institutions, DOE’s Battery Workforce Initiative established national training guidelines certified by the Department of Labor and grounded in real factory work rather than guesswork. States can build upon this work by creating sectoral workforce councils made up of industry, labor, and training experts, providing them with dedicated funding and research capacity, and adopting their recommendations for credentials, apprenticeships, and workforce grants. This ensures training aligns with real jobs, raises worker skills across the industry, and gives workers a seat at the table.

Second, states should lean into tax credits and other incentives to drive market expansion and grow demand for American-made EVs. Colorado’s consumer EV tax credits, Maryland’s Medium-Duty and Heavy-Duty Zero-Emission Vehicle Grant Program, and Washington State’s EV Charging Infrastructure Grants are just a few examples of how states are supporting the transition to cleaner cars and trucks. Domestic content and labor standards tied to incentives help support US manufacturing as well as ongoing technology innovation. States that support and scale these types of programs will drive adoption of clean, electric cars and trucks, and help workers build fulfilling careers that benefit from global growth.

When the federal government pulls back, states can push ahead. Workers deserve better than the Trump administration’s theatrics. Communities deserve cleaner air and more affordable transportation. And the US deserves to lead—not lag—in the global race for EV adoption.

If Washington refuses to model the way forward, states must step up.",https://rooseveltinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-1236626057.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 21:58:31.140671

The Plaquemines Expansion was announced earlier this year with U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, and Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry. Venture Global has since increased the expected output from this project by nearly 40% from the previously announced plans due to the continued optimization of our liquefaction trains and strong market demand. This bolt-on expansion will be built incrementally in three phases and consist of 32 modular liquefaction trains, adding in total over 30.0MTPA in peak production capacity. This will bring the total peak production capacity across the entire Plaquemines complex to over 58.0MTPA. As previously stated, the commercial operations timelines for Phase I and Phase II remain unchanged.

“Venture Global is pleased to announce the formal launch of the permitting process for the Plaquemines Expansion Project. Incrementally expanding Plaquemines is a logical and economically efficient opportunity to build on our strong existing infrastructure,” said Venture Global CEO Mike Sabel. “This strategic step provides Venture Global with the optionality to develop a scalable project that can efficiently meet market needs as they evolve. Our decision to significantly increase the project’s permitted capacity reflects the strong market demand we continue to see and this expansion will play a vital role in meeting that demand.”

The main reason is the high price of financing renewable energy construction.
Both lenders and governments have less experience with renewable energy projects.","You might not know it from the headlines, but there is some good news about the global fight against climate change.

A decade ago, the cheapest way to meet growing demand for electricity was to build more coal or natural gas power plants. Not anymore. Solar and wind power aren’t just better for the climate; they’re also less expensive today than fossil fuels at utility scale, and they’re less harmful to people’s health.

Yet renewable energy projects face headwinds, including in the world’s fast-growing developing countries. I study energy and climate solutions and their impact on society, and I see ways to overcome those challenges and expand renewable energy — but it will require international cooperation.

Falling clean energy prices

As their technologies have matured, solar power and wind power have become cheaper than coal and natural gas for utility-scale electricity generation in most areas, in large part because the fuel is free. The total global power generation from renewable sources saved $467 billion in avoided fuel costs in 2024 alone.

As a result of falling prices, over 90% of all electricity-generating capacity added worldwide in 2024 came from clean energy sources, according to data from the International Renewable Energy Agency.

At the end of 2024, renewable energy accounted for 46% of global installed electric power capacity, with a record 585 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity added that year — about three times the total generating capacity in Texas.

Health benefits of leaving fossil fuels

Beyond affordability, replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy is healthier.

Burning coal, oil and natural gas releases tiny particles into the air along with toxic gases; these pollutants can make people sick. A recent study found air pollution from fossil fuels causes an estimated 5 million deaths worldwide a year, based on 2019 data.

For example, using natural gas to fuel stoves and other appliances releases benzene, a known carcinogen. The health risks of this exposure in some homes have been found to be comparable to secondhand tobacco smoke. Natural gas combustion has also been linked to childhood asthma, with an estimated 12.7% of U.S. childhood asthma cases attributable to gas stoves, according to one study.

Fossil fuels are also the leading sources of climate-warming greenhouse gases. When they’re burned to generate electricity or run factories, vehicles and appliances, they release carbon dioxide and other gases that accumulate in the atmosphere and trap heat near the Earth’s surface. That accumulation has been raising global temperatures and causing more heat stress, respiratory illnesses and the spread of disease.

Electrifying buildings, cars and appliances, and powering them with renewable energy, reduces these air pollutants while slowing climate change.

So what’s the problem?

In spite of the demonstrated economic and health benefits of transitioning to renewable energy, regulatory inertia, political gridlock and a lack of investment are holding back renewable energy deployment in much of the world.

In the United States, for example, major energy projects take an average of 4.5 years to permit, and approval of new transmission lines can take a decade or longer. A large majority of planned new power projects in the U.S. use solar power, and these delays are slowing the deployment of renewable energy.

The 2024 Energy Permitting Reform Act introduced by Sens. Joe Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia, and John Barrasso, a Republican from Wyoming, to speed approvals failed to pass. Manchin called it “just another example of politics getting in the way of doing what’s best for the country.”

An even bigger challenge faces developing countries whose economies are growing fast.

These countries need to meet soaring energy demand. The International Energy Agency expects emerging economies to account for 85% of added electricity demand from 2025 through 2027. Yet renewable energy development lags in most of them. The main reason is the high price of financing renewable energy construction.

In many developing countries, wind and solar projects cost more to finance than coal or gas. Fossil projects have a longer history, and financial and policy mechanisms have been developed over decades to lower lender risk for those projects. These include government payment guarantees, stable fuel contracts and long-term revenue deals that help guarantee the lender will be repaid.

Both lenders and governments have less experience with renewable energy projects. As a result, these projects often come with weaker government guarantees. This raises the risk to lenders, so they charge higher interest rates, making renewable projects more expensive upfront, even if the projects have lower lifetime costs.

To lower borrowing costs, governments and international development banks can take steps to make renewable projects a safer bet for investors. For example, they can keep energy policies stable and use public funds or insurance to cover part of the lenders’ investment risk.

When investors trust they’ll get paid, interest rates drop dramatically and renewable energy becomes the cheaper option.

Without international cooperation to lower finance costs, developing economies could miss out on the renewable-energy revolution and lock in decades of growing greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels, making climate change worse.

The path ahead

To avoid the worst effects of climate change, countries have agreed to cut their greenhouse gas emissions over the next few decades.

Achieving this goal won’t be easy, but it is significantly less difficult now that renewable energy is more affordable over the long run than fossil fuels.

Switching the world’s power supply to renewable energy and electrifying buildings and local transportation would cut about half of today’s greenhouse-gas emissions. The other half comes from sectors where it is harder to cut emissions — steel, cement and chemical production, aviation and shipping, and agriculture and land use. Solutions are being developed but need time to mature. Good governance, political support and accessible finance will be critical for these sectors as well.

The transition to renewable energy offers big economic and health benefits alongside lower climate risks — if countries can overcome political obstacles at home and cooperate to expand financing for developing economies.

Battery Energy Storage Systems hold energy when it’s produced in excess, such as when wind farms see especially windy days, or when solar panels absorb more sun energy than what’s in demand.

Battery Energy Storage Systems hold energy when it’s produced in excess, such as when wind farms see especially windy days, or when solar panels absorb more sun energy than what’s in demand. Energy harvested by the batteries is later used when those resources are in deficit.

Such technology has been materializing across the country in recent years, receiving generous production tax credits from the federal government.

In theory, the sites could help reduce congestion on the power grid and potentially alleviate cost fluctuations that can otherwise cause price spikes for customers. But it’s too early to tell whether that’s the case for projects being proposed in North Dakota, according to Director of Utilities for the Public Service Commission Victor Schock.

The first-ever project under consideration is being proposed by NextEra, a company with several wind farms across the state including a location in Emmons County. That wind farm is where the company is looking to put its $181 million battery storage site, according to its application to the Public Service Commission.

Chair Randy Christmann said he’s apprehensive of normalizing battery storage systems in the state: “I just don’t know how the benefit compares to what it’s costing.”

He said he’s concerned about the grid becoming “reliant” on energy stored in the lithium-ion batteries, especially since the materials typically come from “adversarial” countries.

China produces the majority of the world’s lithium-ion batteries, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

NextEra told the North Dakota Monitor in an emailed statement that the specific battery system has not been finalized for the Emmons County project, but the company has “secured arrangements to source a U.S.-made battery for a significant portion” of its portfolio.

The massive battery units would have the capacity to store 140 megawatts, the amount of electricity used by approximately 13 average homes in one year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Overall, the project would use 24 acres already housing an adjacent wind farm, with construction beginning May 2026 and, if the project is approved, operations starting as early as December that year. It would bring around 150 construction jobs and one to three permanent jobs, the company estimates.

Over the 25-year span of the operation, the county is estimated to reel in $7.2 million in property taxes in addition to the nearly $4 million county application fee.

Emmons County Commissioners and NextEra representatives discussed the permitting costs and taxation at length during a public hearing in August before they approved the project later that month.

During the nearly four-hour meeting, members of the public raised concerns primarily centered on transparency from the company and the safety of the facility.

Some residents said the company had previously been disingenuous in gathering easements for its wind farm; others mentioned how, if the battery storage system were to malfunction and catch on fire, the response would likely be delayed due to the remoteness of the site’s location.

In response, NextEra representatives told the residents they are working with local first responders and volunteers.

In an emailed statement, the company did not share specific data related to safety of battery storage systems but said its systems are extensively monitored and have physical safeguards to minimize any damages should any issues arise.

Commissioner Christmann said he is eager to learn more about the project during its hearing, which is open to the public and scheduled for 9 a.m. Thursday at the Emmons County Courthouse Auditorium in Linton.

On the other end of the state, in Burke County, NextEra is proposing a second battery storage site with 100 megawatts in capacity. The nearly $129 million site would occupy 21 acres and also attach to existing wind energy infrastructure, according to application documents.

Construction is expected to last six months and yield around 100 jobs, with two permanent positions for operations.

On Thursday, 37 of the Michigan House of Representatives’ 52 Democratic members brought a resolution urging U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright to stop issuing extensions for the J.H. Campbell Coal Plant in West Olive.

Wright first issued an extension on the plant’s operations in May, eight days before the plant was scheduled to shut down, citing the Trump administration’s executive order declaring an energy emergency and arguing the plant’s capacity was needed to meet peak energy demand across the Midwest over the summer and preventing blackouts.

The plan to shut down the plant was not a snap decision from its owner, Consumers Energy, which announced in 2021 that it intended to go coal-free by 2025.

Michigan’s energy regulator, the Michigan Public Service Commission approved the company’s shut down plan after weighing input from the Department of Attorney General, environmental and consumer advocates, energy developers, businesses and more, determining Consumers Energy’s plan to retire the plant and shift to other resources was “the most reasonable and prudent means of meeting Consumers’ energy and capacity needs.”

The Midcontinent Independent System Operator, or MISO, which operates the electric grid for much of the central U.S., also signed off on the shutdown, after determining that it would not violate their reliability criteria.

In their resolution, Michigan Democrats pointed to the grid operator’s projections that it had plenty of energy supply to meet expected consumer demand over the summer, while noting the government order conflicts with Consumers’ decision to cease using coal as an energy source.

They also cited the continued costs to ratepayers for operating the plant, in addition to the toll the plant is taking on the environment as well as the health of residents living near the plant.

“The plant releases millions of pounds of air pollutants annually, including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and fine particulate matter. Nearly 9 million tons of climate-harming carbon dioxide are also released annually,” the resolution reads. “The air pollution generated by coal plants has been linked to several negative health impacts such as asthma, cancer, heart conditions, and lung conditions.”

The resolution is unlikely to move forward, as the Republican-led House is not scheduled to meet to vote on policy this week, and the resolution was referred to the Government Operations Committee – generally considered a graveyard for policy.

However, Rep. Stephen Wooden (D-Grand Rapids), one of the resolution’s sponsors, said the Trump administration’s decision to continue ignoring calls to shutdown the plant prompted more formal action.

The Trump Administration is testing American institutions to the bone, Wooden said, arguing that in order to place the country on the right trajectory, Trump’s opponents need to leverage any and all available methods to push back, whether it’s supporting Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel’s legal action against the administration’s orders or highlighting the impacts of Trump’s policies.

“Allowing [the plant] to shut down is in line with our own private industry, with our own utilities, and with the environmental community,” Wooden said. “And you know, even if this doesn’t pass, I think it’s important we can remain clear that this is a damaging decision and it is time for the Trump administration to listen to Michiganders who … don’t want to see more utility price hikes and don’t want dirty coal polluting our airways.”

Bentley Johnson, the federal government affairs director for the Michigan League of Conservation Voters, told the Michigan Advance that the Trump Administration’s decision to extend the Campbell plant’s operations cuts utilities and regulators’ planning process at the knees, while creating questions for what this means for the state’s goal of 100% clean energy by 2040.

He also pointed to testimony presented by a host of separate environmental organizations in opposition to the second extension, which found that during the tightest energy margin of the summer, the Midcontinent Independent System Operator had an energy surplus equal to more than 10 times the amount of energy produced at the Campbell plant.

While Consumers Energy has reported $80 million in costs in keeping the plant open between May 23 and Sept. 30, Johnson noted that this number does not account for the $84 million in costs recovered by selling power to the grid operator.

“If we had to eat all those costs, that’s a lot. But instead, we’re raising the rates in these other states, you know. Rate payers in other states are helping us pay for this,” Johnson said.

Breaking down the cost of continuing to operate the plant during that period comes out to $615,384 per day, Johnson said.

“No one was asking for this, you know, no one wanted this,” Johnson said.

Affordability is the issue of the day, particularly with electric bills, Johnson said. The first step in addressing that issue?

“Don’t make it worse,” Johnson said before noting that it’s not too late for the Trump administration to reverse course.

However, if the extensions continue, Johnson argued Consumers Energy has a duty to their ratepayers to step in and say “this is not right.”

Brian Wheeler, a media relations specialist for Consumers Energy, said the company is ready to continue operating the plant if they receive another order.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-86/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/pxl_20250812_155552401-11763417781.jpg?h=9b96e8ba&itok=IRzPCS8f,N,,2025-11-17 18:01:18.218781

More funding for the Clean Water Infrastructure Act is needed to ensure utilities can make these essential improvements without sharply increasing water rates.","Cortlandt Manor, NY – New York State Senator Peter Harckham, Assemblymembers Steve Otis and Dana Levenberg, environmental advocates and labor leaders urged Governor Hochul today to “hold the line” and protect funding for state water infrastructure projects at last year’s budget levels.

Stressing the enormous need to upgrade water infrastructure in municipalities statewide, attendees at the press conference, including members of the New York Clean Water Coalition and the Construction Industry Council, called for a $500 million investment in the Clean Water Infrastructure Act in the upcoming Executive Budget proposal for FY2026-2027.

“Aging water mains, lead pipes, outdated sewage treatment plants and contaminants put public health and clean drinking water supplies at risk,” Harckham. “New York’s clean water infrastructure funding helps keep our communities safe and habitable, all while ensuring the costs do not get passed on to ratepayers. Governor Hochul has been a good partner on clean water infrastructure funding, and we urge her to maintain the current funding level at $500 million in next year’s budget.”

Harckham added, “Fixing our pipes and treatment plants also creates thousands of good-paying jobs for union plumbers, laborers, operating engineers, and more each year. This has positive impacts on our local economies and encourages businesses to set up shop in places where they can rely on the infrastructure to provide clean water.”

Town of Cortlandt Supervisor Dr. Richard Becker hosted the press conference at the Valeria Wastewater Treatment Plant, where it was announced that Cortlandt is receiving $603,533 in low-cost financing from the state for construction and improvements at the treatment plant, which serves the Dickerson Pond Sewer District.

“We have three water projects going on simultaneously, none of which the Town of Cortlandt could afford, none of which the residents could afford,” said Dr. Becker. “But they’re all going to be solved with the help of our partners in New York State government, and we need to ensure that this kind of support remains in place for municipalities.”

Since 2015, New York has invested over $6 billion in funding the state’s array of clean water programs to fund drinking water and wastewater infrastructure improvements. New York’s programs have been recognized as among the top state clean water programs in the country, with much of the funding delivered through the Environmental Facilities Corporation Inter-municipal Grants (IMG), NYS Green Innovation Grant Program (GIGP) and the NYS Water Infrastructure Improvement Act (WIIA) grant program.

Assemblymember Steve Otis, a longtime advocate for clean water funding, said, “New York’s clean water programs are the most robust in the nation. Our WIIA and IMG programs alone have provided over $3 billion in grant funding to over 1100 projects statewide since 2015. Given the increasing burdens placed on local governments to fund water infrastructure projects for water quality and system capacity, we must maintain our $500 million funding level to clean water programs next year. Storm intensity and flood mitigation challenges continue to increase. Maintaining the clean water budget allocation, the Environmental Protection Fund, and the Bond Act programs are vital to address the increasing needs.”

Assemblymember Dana Levenberg said, “Water is essential. It is imperative that we continue helping municipalities maintain and upgrade clean water infrastructure without increasing the strain on local property taxpayers. Furthermore, we cannot expect to see growth in housing development if we cannot provide this support, and we need to increase housing starts if we are to bring down housing costs. No matter how challenging the upcoming budget year may be, clean water is not the place to make cuts. The Governor must include at least $500 million in her executive budget to fund allocations from the Clean Water Infrastructure Act.”

State Senator Shelley B. Mayer said, “I stand with Senator Harckham, my colleagues, and environmental advocates to fight for New York to maintain the $500 million investment for the Clean Water Infrastructure Act in the 2026-2027 State Budget. As we face increasingly severe and unpredictable weather conditions, we must make the necessary investments to ensure all New Yorkers have safe and reliable drinking water, and it is critical to ensure New York has at least the same amount of funding as last year to keep moving forward.”

New York’s longstanding commitment to clean water programs has protected public health, created thousands of union jobs, reduced the burden on local property taxpayers, and kept water bills affordable. Over $150 million has been dedicated to over 55 projects across Westchester County alone from the WIIA and IMG programs.

In the FY2025-26 adopted state budget, the Governor and the Legislature maintained the statewide annual commitment at $500 million. The demands of local governments have increased to protect drinking water and to meet increasing standards for sanitary sewer system treatment. New challenges exist on issues including emerging contaminants and possible loss of federal dollars.

In addition, local governments need more resources to comply with new federal regulations to make drinking water cleaner. The federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently enacted landmark requirements for water utilities to remove toxic PFAS chemicals from drinking water and replace 100% of lead pipes nationwide. More funding for the Clean Water Infrastructure Act is needed to ensure utilities can make these essential improvements without sharply increasing water rates. The EPA estimates that over $80 billion is needed to repair New York’s aging and outdated water infrastructure.

Adrienne Esposito, Executive Director of Citizens Campaign for the Environment, said, “Clean water is a critical need in both good economic times and challenging economic times. It is a necessity not a luxury item. We’re calling on Governor Hochul to maintain the $500 million for clean water that will protect public health, our economy, and keep water affordable for all New Yorkers. Continued funding for clean water needs has already benefited New York but we have much more to do. We thank Senator Harkham for his leadership in continuing to address this urgent need.”

Jeremy Cherson, Associate Director of Government Affairs at Riverkeeper, said, “Maintaining $500 million in funding for clean water in the upcoming state budget is essential for keeping New Yorkers safe and our natural resources like the Hudson River and Furnace Brook healthy. This fall’s unprecedented harmful algal bloom on the Hudson demonstrates the continued need for these funds to help local governments clean up sewer overflows which help contribute to the conditions that make these blooms possible. Funding more infrastructure which helps keep human waste out of our waterways is non-negotiable. Riverkeeper thanks Senator Harckham for his steadfast commitment to clean water funding, and we look forward to standing with him and our allies to ensure these funds are top priority for Governor Hochul.”

Judith Hansen, Legislative Consultant for the New York Section American Water Works Association (NYSAWWA), said, “New Yorkers have the right to safe, clean water and a healthy environment at an affordable price. The water professionals throughout New York State are working each and every day toward that goal, but they need the state’s help to make it possible. At NYSAWWA, we not only thank the Senator and his colleagues for their efforts but also pledge to join them in this fight.”

John Cooney Jr., Executive Director of the Construction Industry Council of Westchester and Hudson Valley, Inc., said, “The Construction Industry Council of Westchester and Hudson Valley, Inc., along with our partners in organized labor, thank State Senator Pete Harckham, Assemblymembers Dana Levenberg and Steve Otis, as well as Town of Cortlandt Supervisor Dr. Richard Becker for their efforts in bringing a project like this one at the Valerie Treatment Plant to fruition. The need for modernization of municipal sewer and water facilities exceeds the ability of municipalities to fund projects. It is crucial that Governor Hochul maintains in her Executive Budget the $500 million investment in the Clean Water Infrastructure Act.”

David Ansel, vice president of the Center for Water Protection at Save the Sound: “Clean, healthy water is a fundamental human right, and the Clean Water Infrastructure Act plays a critical part in protecting clean water in New York. This essential funding enables communities in the Long Island Sound region and across the state to upgrade insufficient clean water infrastructure, reduce wastewater and stormwater pollution, and protect public and environmental health. We thank Senator Harckham, Assemblymember Otis, and Assemblymember Levenberg for championing clean water in New York State and for urging the Governor to continue to invest in New York communities by committing at least $500 million to the Clean Water Infrastructure Act in the next State Budget.”",https://www.nysenate.gov/sites/default/files/2025/11/17/water-infrastructure-11-17.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 19:58:57.087667

Abandoning 2030 emissions goal would be defeatist concession to Trump, fossil fuel industry

Massachusetts is known as a leader in clean energy and climate action. Our policies have lowered emissions, created jobs, and helped families save money on energy. But a bill currently under consideration in the House of Representatives on Beacon Hill threatens to undo that progress and would be a damaging mistake for our state.

This bill, proposed by Rep. Mark Cusack, the co-chair of the Legislature’s Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities, and Energy, is essentially a fossil fuel industry wish list. It rolls back the Commonwealth’s enforceable 2030 climate targets, weakens the Mass Save energy efficiency program, eliminates efforts designed to make energy efficiency more affordable for working families, and even resurrects the disastrous “pipeline tax” that would allow utilities to charge residents for unnecessary gas infrastructure. In short, it hands fossil fuel companies a gift while leaving Massachusetts households to foot the bill.

At a moment when President Trump is dismantling federal climate policy, this bill would do the work for him. It would abandon our 2030 emissions targets, gut our most effective programs, and lock Massachusetts into the very fossil fuel dependence that has driven today’s affordability crisis. It would cede our hard-earned reputation as a clean energy innovator and put our economy, our health, and our climate at risk.

Our lawmakers must be clear on what’s really driving high energy costs: it’s not clean energy. It’s fossil fuels, gas infrastructure, and aging transmission systems.

In 2023 alone, Massachusetts consumers spent $20 billion on energy in their homes and businesses. Programs like Mass Save delivered over $34 billion in savings between 2012 and 2023 and generated more than $3 for every $1 invested. The program is the only tool we have that actively reduces energy burden for all of us, including low- and moderate-income households that are hardest hit by rising energy costs.

Mass Save has weatherized 350,000 homes (including 70,000 low-income homes), created nearly 76,000 jobs, and saved the equivalent output of five power plants. Even if you’ve never used it directly, you’ve benefited from lower wholesale energy prices because your neighbors did. These are real savings in people’s wallets.

By rolling back these programs and weakening enforceable climate targets, House members would lock the state into an outdated, expensive fossil fuel system. Weakening the 2030 climate target removes enforceable benchmarks that ensure our government takes the action we demand.

Without those benchmarks, Massachusetts risks falling behind while other states, and the world, invest in the clean energy technologies of the future. Communities that are already most vulnerable to pollution and climate impacts—low-income and environmental justice communities—will feel the consequences first.

The House also risks undermining the thriving clean energy economy Massachusetts has built.

Our clean energy sector supports more than 115,000 workers, there are over 7,500 energy businesses statewide, and the clean energy industry has added more than $15.9 billion to the state’s economy since 2012. Clean energy is not just good for our planet; it’s good for our wallets. Weakening climate laws now would send a chilling signal to investors, slow innovation, and damage our long-term economic growth, not to mention dirty the clean air and water we deserve.

This bill tells the rest of the nation that when federal leadership falters, Massachusetts folds. It tells clean energy workers that their jobs don’t matter. It tells communities on the front lines of climate and pollution that their health is negotiable.

But that’s not who we are. Massachusetts became a clean energy and climate leader by setting ambitious goals. We still have five years to hit our 2030 targets. Our legislators must reject this fossil fuel gift and recommit to a future built on affordability, innovation, and climate responsibility. A vote for this bill is a vote to cede our leadership to the Trump administration and the fossil fuel lobby. A vote against it is a vote for Massachusetts – to protect our progress, our economy, and our environment.

The choice is simple: Massachusetts can lead, or we can go back. The people of Massachusetts deserve leadership.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law by President Donald J. Trump in July 2025, played a role in First Solar’s decision to expand in South Carolina. The facility is expected to increase First Solar’s capacity to produce American-made solar technology that is fully compliant with anticipated Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) guidance, by 3.7 gigawatts (GW), reaching 17.7 GW of annual nameplate capacity in 2027.

“The passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the Administration’s trade policies boosted demand for American energy technology, requiring a timely, agile response that allows us to meet the moment,” explained Mark Widmar, chief executive officer, First Solar. “We expect that this new facility will enable us to serve the U.S. market with technology that is compliant with the Act’s stringent provisions, within timelines that align with our customers’ objectives.”

The onshored processes will transform thin film solar cells produced by First Solar’s international fleet into fully completed modules. The new facility expands First Solar’s footprint in South Carolina, which currently includes a distribution center in Duncan, Spartanburg County, and a longstanding partnership with Inland Port Greer. The Gaffney plant will be part of what is already the largest solar technology manufacturing and research and development (R&D) footprint in the Western Hemisphere and includes three fully vertically integrated manufacturing facilities in Ohio, and one each in Alabama and Louisiana, along with R&D centers in Ohio and California. First Solar, which expects to directly employ over 5,500 people in the U.S. by the end of 2026, will have invested approximately $4.5 billion in American manufacturing and R&D infrastructure since 2019.

“South Carolina is proud to be a destination for innovative energy companies that are powering our country with American technology,” said Governor Henry McMaster. “First Solar’s investment will create 600 new jobs in Cherokee County, which will greatly strengthen the local economy and help advance America’s energy independence. Their expanded presence in our state will provide even more opportunities for hardworking South Carolinians.”

Having manufactured in the U.S. since 2002, First Solar is the only one of the world’s largest solar manufacturers to be headquartered in the U.S. By 2027, the company expects to support over 30,000 direct, indirect, and induced jobs across the country, estimated to represent more than $3 billion in labor income.

These are incidents that Smitty’s Supply has reported to regulators.
In January and February 2023, there were “hydrocarbon materials” and an orange “emulsified petroleum product” flowing from Smitty’s Supply outfall canals into a public roadside ditch.
The EPA’s website shows it has issued $161,522 in fines against Smitty’s Supply over the past five years, WVUE-TV Fox 8 reported in August.
That leads to another question: It’s not if there will be another Smitty’s Supply-level disaster, but when and where","Louisiana and the federal government are pushing for more than $1 billion in fines and penalties against Smitty’s Supply Inc. for years of environmental violations and more recent damages from an explosion and petrochemical spill at its Tangipahoa Parish plant.

That dollar figure is eye-catching but also leads one to question: Why did it take an environmental disaster for officials to finally act against a business with an established track record of wiping its feet on regulations meant to curb pollution?

The answer: It’s in line with regulators’ kid-glove approach to environmental enforcement in Louisiana, where state and federal agencies go out of their way to provide a welcome mat for industry while placing the welfare of its residents on the backburner.

Examples of this practice are actually detailed in a lawsuit the state Department of Environmental Quality and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency have filed against Smitty’s Supply. It accuses the company of violating the federal Clean Water Act, the Louisiana Water Control Law and Louisiana Water Pollution Control regulations, among other regulations.

Their complaint cites hundreds of infractions going back nearly five years, culminating with the Aug. 22 disaster at its Roseland facility. Millions of gallons of oil, lubricants and automotive fluids made their way into the nearby Tangipahoa River and flowed several miles downstream. A fire that took two weeks to fully extinguish created an oily soot that covered nearby homes, farms and businesses.

Before that, the company was cited for illegal wastewater discharges, failing to report pollution and seven separate chemical spills since 2021 that went beyond the facility’s property and contaminated public areas.

Between May 2022 and August 2025, Smitty’s Supply reported that it exceeded limits 230 times for the amount of organic material, fecal coliform, carbon and other pollutants it’s allowed to discharge in its wastewater.

These are incidents that Smitty’s Supply has reported to regulators. What’s gone unreported?

According to the lawsuit, the company failed to conduct “daily visual observations” of five outfall canals to check for possible pollutants on weekends and holidays from May 2022 through at least April 2025. A bit of quick math indicates that equals about 350 days without required surveillance. And because these inspections weren’t performed, they couldn’t be logged, which led to additional violations.

Then there are the infractions found when LDEQ inspectors made site visits. In January and February 2023, there were “hydrocarbon materials” and an orange “emulsified petroleum product” flowing from Smitty’s Supply outfall canals into a public roadside ditch.

After the August explosion, regulators determined the company failed to develop a required Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure Plan and didn’t adequately maintain a Facility Response Plan that lays out how it handles such incidents.

All this is to say there is an extensive history of the company failing to take significant steps to address its pattern of violations and minimal evidence of regulators taking meaningful enforcement action to bring about improvements.

The EPA’s website shows it has issued $161,522 in fines against Smitty’s Supply over the past five years, WVUE-TV Fox 8 reported in August. The company paid $250,000 to settle a state complaint over an oil spill in 2021, and the EPA collected $194,772 in 2019 for infractions, WWL-TV reported.

It’s hard to determine what kind of dent these penalties have made in the private company’s bottom line; it doesn’t have to make its revenue and net income public. But on its website, Smitty’s describes itself as “one of the leading manufacturers in the world of lubricants and related products.” It leads you to believe that Smitty’s Supply has had the wherewithal to prevent its many regulatory fumbles over the years, acknowledged and otherwise.

Like Charles Dickens wrote (and Elvis Costello later sang), accidents will happen. But they’re more probable — and maybe less likely to be considered accidents — in a state where officials aren’t willing to take meaningful punitive action to prevent them.

That leads to another question: It’s not if there will be another Smitty’s Supply-level disaster, but when and where",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Smittys-explosion-TPSO.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 18:01:41.853997

Rivian and Volkswagen want to find out.

Rivian and Volkswagen Group Technologies officially launched on November 13, the result of a $5.8 billion joint venture between the two companies that was first announced as a software deal in June. The goal is electrical architecture and software destined for a future generation of EV models from both companies. It paves the way for both small, less-expensive VWs and cheaper Rivian models. It also benefits VW’s off-road offshoot Scout Motors, which is expected to start selling a Rivian-like SUV and pickup truck with an EV-only version, and a gas-assisted range-extended EV by 2028.

The deal also connects Rivian with VW Group’s large network of suppliers for various parts. Rivian is aiming to lower the production costs of the existing R1S SUV and R1T pickup truck, build a plant in Georgia to complement its existing Illinois facility, and introduce the midsize R2 SUV next year as part of its plan to move into more mainstream vehicle segments and expand into Europe.

“The joint venture is rapidly developing the architecture for our future software-defined vehicles,” VW Group CEO Oliver Blume said Wednesday in a statement. “Every step toward achieving our ambitious goals is being executed with determination and clear focus. In close collaboration with our brands, a technological foundation has been created in just twelve months that will enable a new digital driving experience for our customers at accessible prices.”

To make the investment stretch further, however, the joint venture’s technology could be made available to other automakers. Rivian’s Chief Software Officer Wassym Bensaid said the platform under development for both automakers could work for more companies, according to InsideEVs.

While the electrical architecture will be powerful enough for the next-generation of EVs that are expected to make greater use of 800-volt systems that will charge more quickly, it will also be able to support more advanced driver assistant systems like Rivian’s Enhanced Driver Assist and future hands-free driving systems like General Motors’ SuperCruise. Licensing out the technology to other automakers planning more powerful gas-electric hybrids and faster-charging battery electric vehicles—both of which could make more extensive use of cameras, Lidar and other technologies—could be another revenue stream for Rivian and VW, according to the venture’s executives.

Rivian and CEO RJ Scaringe haven’t exactly been secretive about the company’s tenuous finances even before the cancellation of the federal EV tax credit became official at the end of September. It laid off 600 employees in October, the third round in 2025, and while deliveries in the third quarter of the year were up by more than 30%, the annual forecast was lowered to as little as 41,000 vehicles in 2025.

“With the changing operating backdrop, we had to rethink how we are scaling our go-to-market functions,” Scaringe wrote in a company email obtained by Reuters last month.",https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/11/rivian_volkswagen-1200x675.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 19:02:06.534807

The funding will enable Li-S Energy to undertake manufacturing optimisation, a feasibility study and front-end engineering design (FEED) for a proposed lithium-sulfur battery cell manufacturing facility. The proposed facility aims to produce up to 1 GWh per year of battery cell capacity – 500 times the capacity of Li-S Energy’s current Geelong-based facility.

ARENA CEO Darren Miller said the project reflects Australia’s commitment to building local manufacturing capability and accelerating innovation in energy storage.

“By supporting Li-S Energy’s plans to scale up lithium-sulfur battery production, we are helping to fast-track the commercialisation of breakthrough battery technologies.”

“Batteries are essential to the clean energy transition, both for energy storage and transport. That’s why it’s critical we keep advancing innovations that improve performance, increase energy density and drive down costs,” Mr Miller said.

Lithium-sulfur batteries have the potential to deliver up to twice the energy density of conventional lithium-ion batteries, enabling longer range and lighter weight for electric vehicles, drones, wearables and other applications. This aligns with the Australian Government’s energy storage strategy, which prioritises technologies that support renewable integration and reduce reliance on imported battery systems.

Li-S Energy CEO and MD Dr Lee Finniear said the funding is a major step towards commercial readiness.

“This funding enables us to accelerate the critical commercial and engineering studies needed to progress advanced lithium-sulfur batteries toward large-scale production. It will help meet growing demand for lightweight batteries in drones, defence, aerospace and other relevant high-value commercial markets,” Dr Finniear said.

As more renewable energy generation enters the grid, the need for energy storage is increasing. This funding reflects ARENA’s strategic priority to reduce the cost and increase the diversity of technologies available to support the deployment of energy storage in Australia.

This funding has been administered under ARENA’s Advancing Renewables Program, which is continuously open for applications that address our investment focus areas and involve a renewable energy technology or technologies that increase the supply of, or improve the competitiveness of, renewable energy in Australia.

Campbell Coal Plant in West Olive.
The plan to shut down the plant was not a snap decision from its owner, Consumers Energy, which announced in 2021 that it intended to go coal-free by 2025.
However, Rep. Stephen Wooden (D-Grand Rapids), one of the resolution’s sponsors, said the Trump administration’s decision to continue ignoring calls to shutdown the plant prompted more formal action.
“Don’t make it worse,” Johnson said before noting that it’s not too late for the Trump administration to reverse course.","As a West Michigan coal plant continues to produce power nearly 180 days after it was slated to cease operations, several Michigan Democrats are speaking out against President Donald Trump’s administration’s decision to keep the plant online, advising against another extension to its lifespan.

On Thursday, 37 of the Michigan House of Representatives’ 52 Democratic members brought a resolution urging U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright to stop issuing extensions for the J.H. Campbell Coal Plant in West Olive.

Wright first issued an extension on the plant’s operations in May, eight days before the plant was scheduled to shut down, citing the Trump administration’s executive order declaring an energy emergency and arguing the plant’s capacity was needed to meet peak energy demand across the Midwest over the summer and preventing blackouts.

The plan to shut down the plant was not a snap decision from its owner, Consumers Energy, which announced in 2021 that it intended to go coal-free by 2025.

Michigan’s energy regulator, the Michigan Public Service Commission approved the company’s shut down plan after weighing input from the Department of Attorney General, environmental and consumer advocates, energy developers, businesses and more, determining Consumers Energy’s plan to retire the plant and shift to other resources was “the most reasonable and prudent means of meeting Consumers’ energy and capacity needs.”

The Midcontinent Independent System Operator, or MISO, which operates the electric grid for much of the central U.S., also signed off on the shutdown, after determining that it would not violate their reliability criteria.

In their resolution, Michigan Democrats pointed to the grid operator’s projections that it had plenty of energy supply to meet expected consumer demand over the summer, while noting the government order conflicts with Consumers’ decision to cease using coal as an energy source.

They also cited the continued costs to ratepayers for operating the plant, in addition to the toll the plant is taking on the environment as well as the health of residents living near the plant.

“The plant releases millions of pounds of air pollutants annually, including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and fine particulate matter. Nearly 9 million tons of climate-harming carbon dioxide are also released annually,” the resolution reads. “The air pollution generated by coal plants has been linked to several negative health impacts such as asthma, cancer, heart conditions, and lung conditions.”

The resolution is unlikely to move forward, as the Republican-led House is not scheduled to meet to vote on policy this week, and the resolution was referred to the Government Operations Committee – generally considered a graveyard for policy.

However, Rep. Stephen Wooden (D-Grand Rapids), one of the resolution’s sponsors, said the Trump administration’s decision to continue ignoring calls to shutdown the plant prompted more formal action.

The Trump Administration is testing American institutions to the bone, Wooden said, arguing that in order to place the country on the right trajectory, Trump’s opponents need to leverage any and all available methods to push back, whether it’s supporting Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel’s legal action against the administration’s orders or highlighting the impacts of Trump’s policies.

“Allowing [the plant] to shut down is in line with our own private industry, with our own utilities, and with the environmental community,” Wooden said. “And you know, even if this doesn’t pass, I think it’s important we can remain clear that this is a damaging decision and it is time for the Trump administration to listen to Michiganders who … don’t want to see more utility price hikes and don’t want dirty coal polluting our airways.”

Bentley Johnson, the federal government affairs director for the Michigan League of Conservation Voters, told the Michigan Advance that the Trump Administration’s decision to extend the Campbell plant’s operations cuts utilities and regulators’ planning process at the knees, while creating questions for what this means for the state’s goal of 100% clean energy by 2040.

He also pointed to testimony presented by a host of separate environmental organizations in opposition to the second extension, which found that during the tightest energy margin of the summer, the Midcontinent Independent System Operator had an energy surplus equal to more than 10 times the amount of energy produced at the Campbell plant.

While Consumers Energy has reported $80 million in costs in keeping the plant open between May 23 and Sept. 30, Johnson noted that this number does not account for the $84 million in costs recovered by selling power to the grid operator.

“If we had to eat all those costs, that’s a lot. But instead, we’re raising the rates in these other states, you know. Rate payers in other states are helping us pay for this,” Johnson said.

Breaking down the cost of continuing to operate the plant during that period comes out to $615,384 per day, Johnson said.

“No one was asking for this, you know, no one wanted this,” Johnson said.

Affordability is the issue of the day, particularly with electric bills, Johnson said. The first step in addressing that issue?

“Don’t make it worse,” Johnson said before noting that it’s not too late for the Trump administration to reverse course.

However, if the extensions continue, Johnson argued Consumers Energy has a duty to their ratepayers to step in and say “this is not right.”

Brian Wheeler, a media relations specialist for Consumers Energy, said the company is ready to continue operating the plant if they receive another order.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PXL_20250812_155552401-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 18:00:45.328429

Plug reported that the growth was driven by higher hydrogen fuel sales, stronger demand across its electrolyzer portfolio, and pricing enhancements.
During the quarter, Plug advanced several large-scale electrolyzer projects, expanding its global footprint.
Plug continues to prioritize material handling, electrolyzers, and hydrogen fuel businesses while streamlining investments toward mid-term markets, such as stationary power and mobility.
In the second quarter, Plug Power reported a revenue of $174 million, up 21% from $143 million in the same period the previous year.","Hydrogen fuel cell solutions provider Plug Power’s revenue went up by 1.89% year-over-year (YoY) to $177 million in the third quarter (Q3) of the financial year 2025, from $173.7 million.

The company attributed the increase to gains in electrolyzer sales, volume growth in hydrogen fuel sales, and price improvements across operating segments.

Net loss for the quarter rose 72% to $363.5 million from $211.1 million last year.

Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) improved to a loss of $0.12 from a loss of $0.23 last year.

Operating expenses for Q3 rose sharply to $228.6 million from $116.1 million last year. The increase was driven by impairment charges of $97.5 million, compared to $4.1 million in the same period last year, and restructuring expenses of $5.5 million, compared to $0.5 million in 2024.

Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased to $110.6 million from $91.6 million, while research and development expenses decreased to $16.1 million from $19.7 million in the prior year. Consequently, the operating loss widened to $348.8 million from $216.1 million in 2024.

Our revenue performance reflects accelerating customer adoption and sets a solid foundation to meet our year-end goals as we continue driving the hydrogen economy forward.”

9 Month Performance

For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, Plug Power reported a net loss of $789 million compared to $769 million in the same period last year.

Financing activities contributed $313 million in cash inflows, compared to $779 million in the prior year period. Plug’s cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash totaled $849 million at the end of the nine-month period, compared to $1 billion as of September 2024.

Jose Luis Crespo, who also serves as President and Chief Revenue Officer, emphasized that the company is on track for a record year in electrolyzer sales, with $124 million in revenue recorded year-to-date—up 33% year-over-year—and an expected total of around $200 million by year-end.

“We continue to see big opportunities for green hydrogen, particularly in replacing gray hydrogen in refineries like Galp and BP and in producing e-fuels such as e-methanol, synthetic jet fuel, and ammonia,” Crespo said.

He added that with policy clarity improving in Europe and sustained government support in Australia, the company expects increased adoption of green hydrogen across industrial sectors.

He highlighted that Plug’s $8 billion electrolyzer project pipeline remains highly active, with strong prospects for final investment decisions across key markets, particularly Europe and Australia.

Business Highlights

For Q3, the company’s GenEco electrolyzer business generated approximately $65 million in revenue, representing a 46% sequential increase over the second quarter of 2025 and a 13% YoY growth.

Plug reported that the growth was driven by higher hydrogen fuel sales, stronger demand across its electrolyzer portfolio, and pricing enhancements. During the quarter, Plug advanced several large-scale electrolyzer projects, expanding its global footprint. The company reported that over 230 MW of GenEco electrolyzer projects are now being mobilized across Europe, Australia, and North America.

Plug also delivered the first 10 MW GenEco PEM electrolyzer to Galp Energia’s Sines project in Portugal, part of a planned 100 MW installation. The company said it is also advancing multiple multi-megawatt projects across its global markets, representing over 8 GW of opportunity.

In hydrogen fuel production, Plug’s Georgia Green Hydrogen Plant achieved a record output in August, producing 324 tons of liquid hydrogen, with 97% uptime and 99.7% availability.

Plug extended a multi-year hydrogen supply contract with a key domestic partner, securing supply reliability through 2030 and supporting improvements in cost and cash flow.

The company’s hydrogen production network includes 15 TPD live capacity each in Georgia and Louisiana, 10 TPD in Tennessee, and an additional 45 TPD expected from Texas. It had a record production at its Georgia green hydrogen plant in August, achieving 324 tons with 97% uptime and 99.7% availability.

The states allege, in the amici curiae filed, the California laws would impose an “illegal greenhouse gas disclosure policy” and would cause “nightmarish compliance costs and liability on companies across the country.”

In 2023, California enacted laws that require businesses of a certain size to submit greenhouse gas emissions reports and reports on the measures the business planned to adopt to reduce their climate-related financial risk.

That case is still being litigated, but the attorneys general allege the California law seeks to step in and do the same thing the states objected to at the federal level.

The brief said the California law, which would impact businesses outside of the state with revenues above a certain level, requires businesses to express a “certain viewpoint on the highly controversial issue area of climate change.”

It said even if a business believes the climate-related “doomsday scenarios” are unlikely, it has to submit reports about how it plans to respond to the effects of a changing climate.

The brief alleges the California laws are illegal because they compel speech from these companies on a topic they may want to avoid speaking on.

It also alleges the laws would impose “irreparable economic harm on other states.” The brief estimates out-of-state businesses would incur “millions” in auditing and reporting costs for emissions that are outside of California’s borders.

Businesses with more than $1 billion in annual revenue that do business in California are required by the law to disclose “comprehensive greenhouse gas emissions” along their supply chains. Business with $500 million in annual revenue that do business in the state will have to supply biennial climate-related financial risk reports that are publicly available.

California’s enacted Senate Bill 261 says climate change is affecting California communities and economy with wildfires, sea level rise, extreme droughts and extreme weather events.

“Failure of economic actors to adequately plan for and adapt to climate-related risks to their businesses and to the economy will result in significant harm to California,” the law reads.

According to the California statute, mandatory disclosures set by law will help to “ensure a sustainable, resilient, and prosperous future” for the state.

Bird said in a news release Monday about the amici curiae that “California needs to stay in California.”

“California has no right to tell Iowa or any other state what to do,” Bird said in the release. “Their attempt to continually tell other states and businesses how to do business outside California is radical overreach and needs to be stopped.”

Pam Mackey-Taylor, Sierra Club Iowa Chapter’s director, said in a statement that Iowa families are “suffering the real consequences of corporations burning fossil fuels for profit” and cited derechos, droughts and rising insurance costs as an example.

“Climate change is real, and consumers should be able to make informed decisions about whether they prefer supporting companies that are reducing greenhouse gas emissions versus those that are not,” Mackey-Taylor said. “Here in Iowa, we expect our attorney general to serve as the lawyer of the people and take up the everyday issues that affect Iowans, not fight the policies that help protect us.”

A new proposed federal rule that oversees the rivers, streams and other bodies of water in the United States has been released. The rule is called the Waters of the United States.

In May 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court curtailed the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) enforcement of the Clean Water Act in the Sackett v. EPA case prompting the agency to come up with a new set of rules. The court ruled that federal jurisdiction over wetlands is limited to those with a “continuous surface connection” to a relatively permanent body of water.

This decision replaced the “significant nexus” test and limited the EPA’s authority, affecting how wetlands are regulated and leading the agency to revise its definition of “waters of the United States.” The case originated from a property dispute in Idaho where the Sacketts challenged an EPA order to stop filling in wetlands on their land.

“I’m hopeful that whatever happens with the body politic over the next 10 years that this could be a durable rule, because it’s common sense, and I know West Virginia will be weighing in to be supportive of this rule,” Gov. Patrick Morrisey said at a news briefing at the Environmental Protection Agency in Washington, D.C.

Morrisey noted West Virginia led an Amicus (friend of the court) brief in the Sackett case when he was the state Attorney General. The new, proposed rule includes specific definitions of what is, and what isn’t, a protected body of water.

The EPA has begun a 45-day public comment period on the rule.

U.S. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee, applauded the EPA’s announcement of the proposed rule.

“I applaud the Trump EPA’s proposed rule to make the regulatory definition of waters of the United States consistent with the text of the Clean Water Act,” she said. “This proposal takes an important step toward providing a clear and legally-sound framework that aligns with the Supreme Court’s Sackett decision and right-sizes federal jurisdiction. I appreciate the Trump EPA’s effort to take public input in developing this proposal, including by holding a listening session in Charleston to allow West Virginians the opportunity to share their perspectives.”",https://wvpublic.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Elk-River-Fall-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 19:59:00.998533

The new heat pump is scheduled for installation by 2028.
Everllence will supply the heat pump, while DCO Energy will manage installation and plant upgrades.
The project delivers multiple benefits, including giving customers access to carbon-free thermal energy and the Charles River ecosystem seeing reduced thermal impact.
“Vicinity’s heat pump installation is a smart investment—it reduces emissions without compromising performance, and it’s built to operate efficiently over the long term.","In Greater Boston, demolition is underway to make room for the installation of a 35MW river-based industrial heat pump at Vicinity Energy’s Kendall Square facility. Vicinity has also formed a new agreement with DCO Energy to install the heat pump. This is a major step in Vicinity’s electrification strategy for Boston and Cambridge, which will enable carbon-free steam generation for more than 70 million square feet of building space. The new heat pump is scheduled for installation by 2028.

A significant portion of the heat pump’s capacity is already secured through long-term contracts with medical and educational institutions, reflecting strong market demand for decarbonized energy solutions. Everllence will supply the heat pump, while DCO Energy will manage installation and plant upgrades.

As the baseload generator for Vicinity’s electrification plans, the project will be the first to use the Charles River as a renewable resource for carbon-free steam. Vicinity also plans to add thermal storage technologies for on-demand eSteam™ production from renewable electricity. The project delivers multiple benefits, including giving customers access to carbon-free thermal energy and the Charles River ecosystem seeing reduced thermal impact.

“Execution of this project makes Vicinity’s vision of decarbonizing cities at scale a reality,” said Kevin Hagerty, CEO at Vicinity Energy. “Powered by renewable electricity to safely and efficiently harvest energy from the Charles River, this represents rapid advancement in electrification for U.S. district energy systems, demonstrating how proven heat pump technology can be deployed at scale to decarbonize cities. It enables immediate, scalable carbon reductions without the need for costly and time-intensive new electrical infrastructure in Greater Boston. We are establishing the blueprint of how to decarbonize a U.S. city and will be installing similar innovative electrification technologies at our district energy systems across 12 U.S. cities.”

The proposal to build a river-source heat pump complex at Vicinity’s Kendall facility relies on the Charles River’s thermal energy, an untapped renewable energy resource.

Previously, Vicinity installed a new 42MW electric boiler at its Kendall facility, which provides carbon-free thermal energy to its Boston partners through the established 29-miles of steam piping that runs underneath the city — the Boston and Cambridge district energy system. eSteam™ customers currently include IQHQ and Emerson College. By adopting eSteam™, these institutions are not only advancing their sustainability goals but also positioning themselves to comply with local requirements such as BERDO and BEUDO, while aligning with Massachusetts’ Stretch Energy Code.

“Our priority is delivering reliable, practical solutions that make economic sense,” said Gary Fromer, CEO at DCO Energy. “Vicinity’s heat pump installation is a smart investment—it reduces emissions without compromising performance, and it’s built to operate efficiently over the long term. It’s a real-world step toward sustainability that works for today and the future. This collaboration builds upon the recent success of our joint projects in Philadelphia, further strengthening our track record of delivering innovative, sustainable energy solutions together.”

Building on the blueprint established in Boston and Cambridge, Vicinity is applying lessons learned to guide decarbonization plans in other cities. Progress is already underway in Grand Rapids, where installation of a 9MW electric boiler has begun, marking the city’s first step toward electrification.",https://businessfacilities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/adobestock_82066413.jpeg,N,,2025-11-17 17:02:18.334356

The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) was updated in 2016 to reduce exposures to harmful chemicals linked to chronic diseases like cancer. The law is working, and that’s why the chemical lobby wants to change it now and make it weaker.

The law puts health before corporate profits and has resulted in bans on chemicals like the deadly solvents trichloroethylene (TCE) and methylene chloride. This means less profit from dangerous chemicals.

It also works because states can protect the health of their communities by banning chemicals like PFAS. States are spending billions of taxpayer dollars to clean up PFAS once it’s in the environment—the only solution is prevention.

During the first week of the United Nation's 30th Climate Change Conference (COP30), Canada reinforced this commitment by working closely with international partners to promote a shared vision: building economies that are both sustainable and competitive. Canada advocated for smart policies and incentives that cut greenhouse gas emissions while supporting Canadian businesses, protecting jobs, and attracting investment.

Canada's recently announced Climate Competitiveness Strategy includes a renewed commitment to strengthening industrial carbon markets, one of the most effective tools we have to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. At COP30, the Honourable Julie Dabrusin, Minister of Environment and Climate Change, announced Canada's intention to join the Coalition to Grow Carbon Markets—a partnership with states such as the United Kingdom, France, and Singapore that are supporting investments and creating jobs in the rapidly growing global clean economy. Aligned with this outcome, Canada also endorsed the establishment of the Open Coalition on Compliance Carbon Markets, a collaborative forum of like-minded nations to exchange views on carbon pricing mechanisms, carbon accounting methodologies, and best practices on the potential use of high-integrity offset credits.

At COP30, Minister Dabrusin continued to emphasize the importance of strong measurement, monitoring, reporting, and verification systems to drive down methane emissions, a potent greenhouse gas responsible for nearly a third of current global warming. At a ministerial meeting, she highlighted the critical role of the International Methane Emissions Observatory to move from emissions estimates to accurate measurement data.

Moderated by MS NOW’s Rosa Flores, Perryman spoke to an audience on a panel titled “A Democracy, If You Can Keep It.” The Texas Tribune Festival highlights ideas that shape the future of technology, safety and security, culture and the arts, education, the economy, energy, and healthcare, and more — with those driving decisions in Texas and across the nation.

Perryman’s remarks were centered on how the American people can respond to rising threats of autocracy. She highlighted the role of the courts enforcing compliance with their rulings, how to build broad coalitions in the face of rapid attempts to bring the nation into autocracy, and the way in which Democracy Forward and its partners are providing people and communities legal representation. During her remarks and in response to audience questions, Perryman issued a warning about the normalization of the government not complying with court orders and the importance of American people mobilizing into court:

“The ability of people to initiate litigation against their government is a critical tool, whether in state and local communities or at the federal level.”

“This administration’s ignoring court orders across this country should not be normalized. Court orders at the local level keep people safe. And we need to also be focused on that…We are litigating every day to enforce court orders… It is important that the vast majority of the American people, the vast majority, including, by the way, many conservatives and many who have been aligned in the past with the president, believe that the government should follow [court] orders.”

“The American people are showing that the emperor has no clothes…There is great opportunity in the president’s overreach and there is a way that this crisis can be a catalyst for true change. Not putting Humpty back together again on… a wall that was not built to hold us. But to rebuild and reimagine in this moment and to do it while fighting for people, because lives are on the line every day.”

“One branch of government cannot check another branch of government without broader mobilization. And so it is time for Congress to wake up. It is time for the American people to demand that Congress wake up… And that’s not just Congress, it’s us. It’s mass mobilizations. It’s learning again how to strike and how to boycott and how to say that the people in this country still get to be in charge. We are going to have to learn to build those muscles.”

“If you talk about the shutdown, at the beginning of the shutdown, the president was claiming that he really wanted to feed 42 million Americans, but that he couldn’t do it? That’s what he was claiming. He didn’t have a legal authority to do it…We went into federal court with the Rhode Island Council of Churches, with the Service Employees International Union, because workers need SNAP too, with grocery stores, with food providers, with food banks, with the largest coalition we’ve seen since inauguration on these cases. And through a range of court orders, every single court that looked at this said that not only did the president have the authority to pay SNAP benefits, he had the obligation… People did see it for what it was, which was the president that was weaponizing the federal government against the very people that it is intended to serve.”

Boulder, CO — November 17, 2025

With cooling demand set to grow 2.5-fold by 2050, Third Derivative, RMI’s global climate tech accelerator, today announced a call for passive daytime radiative cooling (PDRC) solutions for several pilot opportunities designed to validate the technology across diverse climates and building types in the United States and India.

Cooling is no longer a luxury — it is a global necessity essential for health, productivity, and survival. Conventional air conditioning and refrigeration currently account for more than 10 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Third Derivative is working to scale breakthrough cooling technologies that can cut emissions, improve resilience, and expand access to affordable cooling in heat-vulnerable regions.

“We are at a tipping point for cooling. Conventional, business-as-usual solutions are not enough — not enough to mitigate cooling-related climate pollution, and not enough to protect vulnerable communities against extreme heat.” said Rushad Nanavatty, Third Derivative’s managing director. “Those who need breakthrough cooling solutions the most are the least able to afford them. By accelerating the deployment of solutions like passive daytime radiative cooling, we can radically expand access to affordable, zero-energy cooling that addresses both challenges.”

PDRC technologies — such as paints, films, and membranes — have the potential to lower indoor temperatures by up to 18°F (10°C) on hot days without using electricity. RMI and Third Derivative are inviting leading PDRC manufacturers to apply for participation in upcoming global pilots. Selected products will be evaluated for their cooling performance, affordability, scalability, durability, toxicity, and embodied carbon.

Through these pilots, Third Derivative and partners will collect critical data to assess performance, evaluate human and environmental benefits, and advance commercialization pathways for promising solutions. Third Derivative’s pilot projects are designed to generate open-source evidence that supports equitable, transparent deployment of sustainable cooling solutions.

In India, Third Derivative is collaborating with a research institution and local grassroots partner to pilot PDRC products in an informal housing community in Ahmedabad, improving indoor comfort and community well-being amid rising heat stress. In the United States, Third Derivative will work with technical partners to test PDRC products on commercial buildings. Together, these pilots will demonstrate the technology’s versatility and scalability.

These projects in India and the United States are made possible through seed funding from the Autodesk Foundation and the Bezos Earth Fund, respectively, whose early support is catalyzing the testing and scaling of zero-energy cooling solutions. Additional partners and funders are being engaged to expand the pilots to more sites, products, and geographies, advancing equitable, data-driven pathways for global deployment.

“Access to cooling is a matter of both fairness and survival,” said RMI CEO Jon Creyts. “With support from RMI, Third Derivative, and our ambitious partners, innovators have the opportunity to jump-start novel technologies that will transform how the world stays cool, without heating the planet.”

These efforts are part of RMI’s broader Global Cooling Initiative, which leverages cutting-edge startups, partners, and financing to advance sustainable cooling solutions, from efficient appliances to eco-friendly refrigerants and better refrigerant management.

Next, we report on a bid to clean up the Ohio River. The river begins in Downtown Pittsburgh and flows past several states on its way to Cairo, Illinois. It's played a big role in American history and American industry. The Ohio was downriver of every Pittsburgh steel mill. It had other mills along its banks from Steubenville, Ohio, to Ashland, Kentucky. Anything along the Tennessee River or the Wabash flows into the Ohio, which leads to a question. How do you clean it up now? A plan to scrub it would take support from Congress. Morgan Watkins of Louisville Public Media went out on the water.

People call it a working river because it's an important pathway for barges, transporting millions of tons of cargo each year. One floats by carrying freight past a family-owned sand company on the shore, one of many riverside businesses. The booming of industry along the Ohio River has boosted the economies of many waterfront towns, but it also took an environmental toll.

Forest Clevenger is paddling the canoe. He leads a nonprofit called the Ohio River Way. He's excited about an idea to protect the wetlands, rivers and streams that make up the entire Ohio River Basin through investments in...

FOREST CLEVENGER: Clean water, habitat restoration, flooding mitigation and public recreational infrastructure.

WATKINS: It's a big vision, but he says it's not unique.

CLEVENGER: Like restoration initiatives that are in watersheds all around the country, just not here.

WATKINS: He's talking about restoration programs launched for historic American waters in recent decades, like the Great Lakes, Chesapeake Bay and the Everglades. In all of them, the federal government has been providing substantial funding and coordinating partnerships with states and local communities. Now, after several years of work, people in this region have a blueprint to take to Congress. It's called the Ohio River Basin Restoration and Protection Plan.

(CROSSTALK)

WATKINS: Last month, the groups behind the plan co-hosted a special conference in Louisville. Chris Lorentz chairs one of them, the Ohio River Basin Alliance.

CHRIS LORENTZ: This is a game-changer - a once-in-a-lifetime, once-in-a-generation opportunity. We're asking for this now, and we're going to show that it's worth the investment.

WATKINS: What they're asking for is money from Congress, an initial investment of $350 million per year for five years. The funds could help do things like clean up contaminated sites and update public water systems along the river. The plan's supporters say repairing the region's environmental health will boost local tourism and economies. That's why Lorentz has high hopes Congress and President Trump will fund it.

LORENTZ: When you look at the priorities of any administration, including the current one, it's economic development. It's community enhancement.

WATKINS: While their plan focuses a lot on restoring the environment, he says it checks those economic boxes too. Democratic Congressman Morgan McGarvey of Louisville is working on bipartisan legislation to launch the Ohio River restoration initiative.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

MORGAN MCGARVEY: The Ohio River is the largest body of water in the entire country that does not receive a single dollar in dedicated federal funding. Not one. That's something we got to change.

WATKINS: He acknowledges getting Congress' approval won't happen easily or quickly.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

MCGARVEY: We will never stop fighting because I think this is the type of legacy generational product where I hope 50, 60, 70, a hundred years from now, nobody knows who did it, but they love and stand in awe and in wonder of the incredible Ohio River and the Ohio River Valley.

WATKINS: Supporters know it's an uphill battle. But after years of work building a coalition across 14 states and hundreds of communities that make up the Ohio River Basin, they finally have a detailed plan to show Congress what is possible with their support.

Now, satellites and aircraft have become key tools to spot methane super-polluters like oil and gas operations, landfills, and coal mines – which is an important step in slowing down pollution.

Why methane matters to the climate

Many people know that carbon dioxide is the largest contributor to climate change. But methane matters, too, because of how effectively it traps heat in the atmosphere – like an extra-thick down duvet. In its first 20 years in the atmosphere, methane has about 80 times the warming impact compared to carbon dioxide. The short-acting but powerful effect of methane makes cleaning it up a prime target for slowing climate warming as quickly as possible.

But so far, it’s been hard to unravel exactly how much methane is being emitted, and from where.

Scientists know that methane can bubble up from diffuse sources like cow burps or flooded rice fields. Or it can pour into the atmosphere from oil and gas operations. Sometimes it leaks from defective equipment; sometimes it’s released intentionally. Some methane releases go unreported, and some emissions estimates appear to be significantly undercounted.

No matter the source, as the amount of methane in the atmosphere climbs ever higher, the race to pinpoint these pollution sources is accelerating.

How eyes in the sky can help

Satellite and aircraft observations are now revealing the myriad locations where methane pollution is occurring. Measurements from above show how oil and gas extraction, landfills, coal mines, and large-scale livestock agriculture operations are causing substantial amounts of methane pollution.

Riley Duren is the CEO of Carbon Mapper, one of several organizations using satellites to measure climate-warming greenhouse gases such as methane.

“Our current focus at Carbon Mapper is on methane monitoring of super-emitters, because that’s the biggest potential for immediate emission reductions,” Duren said.

He explained that as methane-measuring satellites proliferate, they’re helping to bring our fuzzy understanding of methane emissions into sharper focus.

The quickest bang-for-buck to slow climate-warming pollution would be to pinpoint the large emitters and work toward cleaning them up. These large-scale, point-source emissions account for about 40% of total methane emissions from human activities.

The Carbon Mapper data portal combines observations from five different instruments, and one of the most powerful aspects of this data is that it doesn’t rely on corporate or government reporting. Anyone can see the results for themselves.

Read: Climate polluters may be allowed to stop reporting their emissions. That doesn’t mean they can hide them.

Read on for the breakdown of some of the largest methane polluters observed in the U.S. These results are based on methane plumes measured by the five instruments within the Carbon Mapper data portal as of Oct. 16, 2025. These findings aren’t a comprehensive accounting of all methane emissions in the U.S., but they’re a snapshot of some of the largest and most persistent sources of methane pollution measured so far.

1. Oil and gas industry, especially in Texas and New Mexico

4,800 individual sources of large methane emissions from the U.S. oil and gas industry have been measured and mapped to date

1.2 million pounds of methane released per hour in the U.S.

The Permian Basin is a region of thick sedimentary rocks in western Texas and southeastern New Mexico. It’s the largest source of crude oil in the U.S., as well as a major producer of natural gas, which is primarily composed of methane.

Satellite images show thousands of plumes of methane billowing from numerous types of infrastructure: wells, pipelines, compressor stations, and gas processing facilities.

Sharon Wilson and Justin Mikulka work for a small nonprofit named Oilfield Witness that documents methane released from oil and gas infrastructure.

“The Permian is a methane disaster,” Mikulka said.

Many of these methane plumes are not leaks: “Those are intentional releases to protect the equipment and maintain operation,” Wilson said.

One example is flaring, which is when methane is burned intentionally. A methane flare looks dramatic because it makes a large flame. But burning methane is better for the climate than releasing it directly to the atmosphere, because burning methane converts it to the less potent carbon dioxide.

One problem with flaring, Wilson explained, is that the flares often malfunction. Sometimes they burn inefficiently, releasing a mixture of methane and carbon dioxide. Even worse, the pilot light on the flares can go out, and then methane is not burned at all – it just vents directly to the atmosphere.

“I have tracked flares being unlit for well over a year,” she said.

In theory, flaring is supposed to be used infrequently. But Oilfield Witness analyzed the applications used by oil and gas companies as they requested permission to burn or vent methane in Texas. State regulators approved these applications over 99% of the time. A collaborative story between Inside Climate News and ProPublica paints the picture behind these massive methane emissions in Texas.

Satellite data can shine a light on the large and frequent releases of methane from oil and gas operations. In some situations, Duren and the Carbon Mapper team reach out to oil and gas operators when they find large methane plumes.

“We have seen a number of cases – over 150 to date – where operators do take steps to close leaks when notified,” he said.

But Wilson and Mikulka aren’t optimistic.

“The industry has the tools to track what they’re doing in real time, and yet nothing changes,” Mikulka said.

“There’s just absolutely no evidence that the U.S. oil and gas industry can produce oil and gas without huge methane emissions,” Wilson said.

2. Landfills

336 individual super-emitter landfills have been detected to date

500,000 pounds of methane emitted per hour

Landfills produce many of the largest plumes of methane measured by Carbon Mapper in the U.S.

Methane releases from oil and gas extraction are numerous, but they’re often short-lived or intermittent. By contrast, landfills tend to give off methane over months or years, which adds up to a substantial amount of methane pollution.

Given the large scale of methane coming from landfills, it’s all the more important to have accurate measurements. But reporting methods currently used by the EPA are not in agreement with data coming from aircraft and satellites. Several recent studies using aircraft and satellite measurements have found considerably larger emissions than the estimates from the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program.

Landfill operators can use fairly simple measures to slow methane emissions, such as capturing and collecting the gas or using impermeable covers. Organic materials like food waste release large amounts of methane, and municipalities can divert food waste from landfills by using composting programs. As is often the case with cutting pollution, the economic benefits of implementing these actions are greater than the costs.

As of this writing, the U.S. landfills with the largest methane emissions based on Carbon Mapper observations are in Okeechobee, Florida, Orlando, Florida, and Melissa, Texas.

Note: The image from Orlando shows an optical effect over water. The dark surface of water makes it harder for instruments to “see” methane in the air. That’s why the methane plume is visible over the bridge but not over the water adjacent to the bridge.

3. Coal mines

192 super-emitter mines have been detected to date

220,000 pounds of methane emitted per hour

Coal formed when vegetation was buried in an oxygen-poor environment, compressed, and heated for millions of years. This same process also produced natural gas – which, again, is composed primarily of methane. The natural gas collects in coal seams and in the fractures and pores of the surrounding rock.

Underground mines are the largest source of concentrated methane emissions. In some cases, methane floats up from ventilation shafts, which are necessary to protect workers. Both active and abandoned coal mines can emit methane. Some methane emissions from coal mines can be captured, particularly where methane is coming from ventilation systems.

Individual mines can be the cause of disproportionately high amounts of methane pollution. For example, the Hail Creek mine in Queensland, Australia, accounts for 20% of all methane coming from coal mines in Australia, while producing only 1% of the country’s coal.

Worldwide, methane from coal mines is often underreported. In Australia, for example, data from the Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite showed coal mines are emitting at least 40% more methane than previous estimates.

In the U.S., Carbon Mapper found the largest concentration of super-emitting coal mines in southwestern Pennsylvania and north-central West Virginia. The mines with the highest rates of methane emissions measured so far by Carbon Mapper are in Aleppo, Pennsylvania, Sycamore, Pennsylvania, and Burton, West Virginia.

4. Livestock

317 super-emitter livestock operations have been detected to date

47,000 pounds of methane emitted per hour

Livestock like cows and sheep produce methane as part of their digestive process. In most cases, methane emissions from livestock are too low in concentration to be detected by aerial measurements. These numerous but small sources of methane have a large impact on the atmosphere, especially when you consider the thousands of farms across the country. Nevertheless, satellites and aircraft can only spot the largest polluters, and they don’t see smaller, diffuse methane emissions that come from many farms.

Feedlots, large dairy farms, and animal processing facilities concentrate enough animals and their waste into small enough areas that their methane pollution can be detected with overhead measurements. These large methane plumes in the Carbon Mapper database are just a subset of the overall emissions from the livestock industry.

In the U.S., one of the most persistent sources of methane from livestock in the Carbon Mapper database so far is in Greeley, Colorado, which appears to be a cattle feedlot. Instruments have flown over this site more than 20 times, with methane detected 96% of the time, with maximum emissions measured at over 4,400 pounds per hour.

Together, these landmark laws launched the largest resurgence of U.S. semiconductor manufacturing in decades.","WASHINGTON, D.C.— Today, Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-1), along with Congressman Brendan F. Boyle (PA-2) today introduced the bipartisan, bicameral Strengthening Essential Manufacturing and Industrial (SEMI) Investment Act, landmark legislation that closes the most significant remaining gap in U.S. semiconductor policy: the lack of support for the materials that make chip manufacturing possible.

For years, China has controlled the global market for substrates, thin films, lithography materials, process chemicals, and other inputs that American fabs depend on. The SEMI Investment Act, introduced in the Senate by Senators Bennet, Blackburn, Tillis, and Coons, directly counters that imbalance. By extending the CHIPS tax credit to upstream materials, the bill ensures these capabilities are built in the United States, not outsourced to strategic competitors.

This reform strengthens America’s economic resilience, reduces exposure to coercive supply-chain pressures, and reinforces the industrial base that supports our national defense.

This legislation is supported by the leading organizations across America’s semiconductor, advanced materials, chemical, and manufacturing sectors, including SEMI, Entegris, CoorsTek, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Qnity Electronics, Brewer Science, the American Chemistry Council, the Compressed Gas Association, and EFC Gases & Advanced Materials.

“Semiconductor leadership starts long before a chip ever reaches a fabrication line—it starts with the materials that make modern manufacturing possible. Our SEMI Investment Act ensures those materials are built here at home. By expanding the credit to upstream suppliers, we secure every link of the semiconductor ecosystem, strengthen our resilience, reduce dependence on China, and give American manufacturers the certainty they need to compete, innovate, and lead,” said Fitzpatrick. “This is a bipartisan, practical solution to a structural weakness in our supply chain, and positions the United States to stay ahead for decades to come.”

Fitzpatrick continued, “Pennsylvania is already a national hub for advanced manufacturing, research, and engineering talent — and this legislation builds directly on that strength. As colleagues and proud Pennsylvanians, Congressman Boyle and I are working to bring materials production home, drive new investment into our region, support high-quality jobs, and ensure that Pennsylvania’s workers and industries remain at the forefront of America’s semiconductor future.”

“Revitalizing American semiconductor manufacturing is essential to our economic strength and our national security. I was proud to support the CHIPS and Science Act — and our new legislation builds on that work by strengthening our semiconductor supply chain for the long term,"" said Boyle.

Key Provisions of the Semi Investment Act

Expands the CHIPS Act tax credit to include upstream materials essential to semiconductor production.

Provides clear statutory definitions for direct and indirect production materials, reducing uncertainty for industry planning and investment.

Requires annual materials qualification lists from Treasury and Commerce, with an expedited review pathway for emerging technologies.

Extends the Advanced Manufacturing Investment Credit through 2031, aligning federal incentives with long-horizon capital investments.

Why This Legislation Is Urgently Needed

China controls up to 85% of global processing of rare earth elements and key semiconductor inputs.

These materials underpin America’s defense systems, AI computing, clean energy technologies, medical devices, and the broader innovation economy.

Without domestic materials production, CHIPS-funded fabs remain vulnerable to supply shocks, export controls, and strategic coercion from the Chinese Communist Party.

Background

Congressman Fitzpatrick has been a leading champion of strengthening America’s semiconductor competitiveness and rebuilding domestic manufacturing capacity. He was a champion of the original CHIPS and Science Act, signed into law in 2022, which reestablished U.S. leadership in advanced chip production, created the 25% Advanced Manufacturing Investment Credit (AMIC), and helped drive more than $630 billion in announced semiconductor investments nationwide.

In 2023, Fitzpatrick also backed the Building Chips in America Act, which removed permitting barriers, accelerated project timelines, improved federal coordination, and ensured CHIPS investments could move from planning to construction more quickly.

Class of 2023

Environmental Studies, BA/Environmental Science and Policy, MS

You are the author of an environmental children’s book, Greeny La-Roo and the Earth Crew. What inspired you to write this book and what do you hope readers will glean from it?

During my time working as a naturalist for Westchester County Parks at Lenoir Preserve, I had the privilege of teaching children about the environment and the importance of protecting it. I quickly noticed that many existing children’s books with environmental themes focused on awareness, but not on action. As someone who believes deeply in empowering others to make a difference, I wanted to create a story that not only educated young readers but also inspired them to do something. To feel that they could be heroes for the planet, too.

That realization sparked Greeny La-Roo and the Earth Crew, designed to blend imagination, fun, and real-world impact. My hope is that children come away from the story feeling excited, capable, and ready to take small but meaningful actions to care for our Earth.

You graduated from Pace with a combined Environmental Studies, BA/Environmental Science and Policy, MS. How did your studies inspire and prepare you for authoring this book?

My studies were instrumental to the subject matter in the book. I’ve always loved spending time outdoors, but it wasn’t until I began my academic journey at Pace that I truly understood how the places I cherished and the wildlife I was passionate about protecting were being impacted by a changing climate. Through my coursework in environmental studies and environmental science and policy, I gained a deeper awareness of the challenges facing our planet and the interconnectedness between people, nature, and policy. My studies not only provided the scientific foundation for Greeny La-Roo and the Earth Crew but also strengthened my lifelong mission to protect the planet for current and future generations.

You also host a podcast called The Hopeful Environmentalist. Please tell us more about that.

I started The Hopeful Environmentalist (THE) podcast in my college apartment while pursuing my master’s degree at Pace. At the time, I was overwhelmed by the constant stream of bad news about our changing climate and its impacts on people, animals, and the planet. I craved a space that focused on hope, the kind that inspires action instead of despair. As I dove deeper, I realized that while science and policy are essential to solving the climate crisis, they’re often not translated in ways the public can easily understand. So, I created THE to bridge that gap.

Today, the podcast, rated top 11 best environmental podcast in 2023, has listeners in over 35 countries. You can listen to it anywhere you stream podcasts/music.

In addition to being an author, what has your career trajectory been like since graduation?

After finishing my degree, I moved to Washington, DC, to intern at the White House Council on Environmental Quality under the Biden-Harris Administration. I then relocated to North Dakota, where I worked as a contractor for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on environmental policy, while also a social media assistant, podcast editor, and ultimately, communications coordinator for Our Climate. I soon realized how much I wanted to deepen my skills in storytelling and communication—so I began focusing on THE podcast. Through it, I’ve had the privilege of being invited to speak at the United Nations Conference on Biological Diversity and the UK Mission to the UN, as well as receiving media badges at EarthX’s Congress of Conferences and Climate Week NYC.

Next, I joined the Pace University Gale Epstein Center, where I currently work part-time on water policy initiatives, in addition to as a full-time social media coordinator at Vocal Media.

Through my coursework in environmental studies and environmental science and policy at Pace, I gained a deeper awareness of the challenges facing our planet and the interconnectedness between people, nature, and policy.

Why did you choose to attend Pace?

I was looking for a university that would not only provide a strong academic foundation but also offer opportunities to gain real-world experience and connect with organizations making a difference. The decision to attend Pace proved to be one of the best I’ve made. I gained practical experience in everything from field data collection to conducting informational interviews, and those experiences ultimately helped me earn an internship at the White House Council on Environmental Quality and has set my career in motion.

What activities and organizations were you involved with as a student?

I served as president of the NATURE Club, where I worked alongside a passionate group of students to create hands-on environmental experiences for the Pace community. We organized campus clean-up days, sustainability-focused events, and off-campus trips, including a memorable visit to the Wolf Conservation Center, to give students unique opportunities to connect with conservation organizations. Beyond the NATURE Club, I participated in the Environmental Studies and Science department’s Career Day, which introduced me to mentors and internship opportunities that helped shape the foundation of my career.

What were your experiences like in the Environmental Studies and Science department on the Pleasantville campus? What faculty had been instrumental in your journey as a student?

I truly loved my time in the Environmental Studies and Science department. Every professor I had played a role in shaping the environmentalist I am today by opening doors to opportunities I might never have discovered on my own. However, two professors who had the greatest impact on my journey were Professor John Cronin and Professor Michelle Land. Through their classes and mentorship, I gained a deeper understanding of the policy and advocacy side of the environmental field, a perspective that ultimately helped me secure an internship at the White House Council on Environmental Quality. Their dedication to student success went far beyond the classroom, from organizing mock hearings to helping us build meaningful networks.

What advice would you give to our students, as they navigate college life?

Define your own path and stay open to where it may lead. Also, talk to your professors. Their mentorship and stories can open doors you didn’t even know existed. Further, take classes outside your major, explore topics that spark your curiosity, and seek experiences that fuel your passions, not just your resume. Most importantly, enjoy the process. College isn’t just about preparing for your career, it’s also about discovering who you are, what you care about, and what kind of impact you want to make.",https://www.pace.edu/sites/default/files/2025-11/dyson-article-teaser-environmental-studies-science-taylor-gannis.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 17:02:01.970887

That’s why battery temperature management (cooling or heating) is critical in electric vehicles.
Once the hottest point reaches the temperature limit, thermal throttling (thermal derating) kicks in and DC fast-charging speeds decrease.
According to Hydrohertz, it’s possible to reduce the DC fast-charging time of an EV battery by two-thirds, from approximately 30 minutes to around 10 minutes, through more precise cooling of the battery.
A more advanced approach to battery cooling should enable the full potential of existing battery technology to be unleashed.","Temperature is one of the most important factors for battery charging. Temperatures outside of the optimal range for a certain battery chemistry significantly limit the acceptable charge rate. That’s why battery temperature management (cooling or heating) is critical in electric vehicles.

Over the years, we have seen EV manufacturers move from air-cooled battery systems to liquid-cooled battery systems and improve them to achieve higher performance — for example, moving them from the bottom plate to the bottom and top plates.

However, most solutions still feature a single cooling loop for the entire battery pack, which proves to be a weak point because it creates a temperature difference between the beginning and the end of the loop. Once the hottest point reaches the temperature limit, thermal throttling (thermal derating) kicks in and DC fast-charging speeds decrease.

The Dectravalve

Hydrohertz, a startup founded in 2020, proposes a solution in the form of a multi-zone valve system that delivers precise heating, cooling, or energy recovery across up to four independently controlled zones from a single inlet. It’s called Dectravalve.

According to Hydrohertz, it’s possible to reduce the DC fast-charging time of an EV battery by two-thirds, from approximately 30 minutes to around 10 minutes, through more precise cooling of the battery. Of course, the charging performance is set for a specific battery chemistry and can be limited by the charger’s power (or voltage), but at least the temperature should no longer be the limiting factor.

Hydrohertz describes an experiment where it recharged a 100-kWh EV battery (LFP chemistry) without exceeding 44.5°C and with a difference of only 2.6°C across the whole pack. The company claims that the typical limit is usually 56°C, while the differences can be as high as 12°C.

Because the hottest cells do not trigger thermal throttling, the charging process can continue at maximum/high rate. Hydrohertz claims that charging from 10 to 80% state of charge is possible in around 10 minutes:

“In the same test, Dectravalve demonstrated that charging times can be slashed by up to 68%, meaning a typical 30-minute 10-80% charge on a 350kW fast charger could drop to around 10 minutes, putting EV charging on a par with conventional petrol/diesel vehicle refuelling times.”

An additional side effect of zonal cooling and modular thermal management is that during regular operation, the vehicle might be more efficient, which translates to lower energy consumption and higher range (especially in extreme ambient temperatures). Improved safety and longevity benefits were mentioned, too.

A more advanced approach to battery cooling should enable the full potential of existing battery technology to be unleashed.

The Quiet Part of the Revolution This is the quiet part of the energy transformation.","Over the past five years, the energy transition has been loud in some places. We have seen data centers booming, capacity prices climbing, renewables surging and virtual power plants gaining traction. But beneath those headlines, a revolution message has been unfolding, sector by sector, driven not by policy or utilities but by private businesses stepping into roles once reserved for monopolies.

Take Caterpillar, for example. Long known for its heavy machinery, the company now offers a Distributed Energy Resource Management System (DERMS) platform, an unexpected pivot that underscores how deeply energy intelligence is being woven into commercial and industrial operations. From retail and manufacturing to real estate and tech, companies are learning that energy is no longer a fixed cost. It’s a controllable variable, one that can be optimized, monetized and aligned with long-term business strategy.

Commercial Customers: The Grid’s Unsung Stabilizers

At the center of this shift are commercial customers, who are increasingly the steady force in an uncertain grid. Unlike residential users, whose Peak Load Contribution (PLC) is largely uncontrollable and often meaningless for planning or cost-reduction purposes, commercial PLCs can be actively managed. And that’s where the real innovation is happening.

Multifamily communities are increasingly operating like commercial customers, and that shift is transforming their role on the grid. By pairing the right supply contracts with DERMS platforms, multifamily developers and operators can now manage usage, flexibility and capacity just like office parks or manufacturing sites have done for years. This isn’t theoretical; it’s already underway. Properties are optimizing load, reducing costs and contributing to grid stability by applying commercial-grade energy intelligence to what was once a passive residential segment. The result: a fast-growing, data-driven force for grid support emerging from the multifamily sector.

From Energy Management to Energy Mastery

Nationwide Energy Partners (NEP) has seen this evolution firsthand. Our roots are in multifamily communities, properties that behave more like small commercial campuses than clusters of individual homes. By aggregating these accounts and managing energy through sophisticated metering, billing and now DERMS-aligned technology, we’re unlocking new value across the system.

What began as a niche service, helping multifamily developers navigate complex utility structures, has evolved into a multi-state energy services platform that integrates energy into the very fabric of property management. Our approach goes beyond meter reading and billing. Through data-informed operations, proactive maintenance and insight-driven tools, NEP helps property owners treat energy as a controllable asset rather than an uncontrollable expense.

Our O&M Insights system extends that philosophy further, using in-unit smart devices to proactively detect leaks, monitor performance and resolve issues remotely. The benefits are tangible: fewer truck rolls, reduced operating costs, improved resident comfort and better visibility into consumption patterns.

Private Innovation, Public Benefit

The broader implications are profound. Aggregating the huge, ignored multifamily industry (17.7 million Americans rent apartments) doesn’t just create buying power; it generates the kind of granular, real-time energy data that utilities and grid operators have long struggled to access. That visibility enables properties to proactively reduce capacity costs, generate verifiable carbon reductions and deploy grid-supportive technologies that enhance resilience across entire communities.

Even residents, who are often left out of the energy equation, stand to benefit. With smart technologies in their units, they can track usage, manage costs and understand their environmental impact in ways that were once impossible. The relationship between end-users and energy is becoming more participatory, more transparent and ultimately more sustainable.

The Quiet Part of the Revolution

This is the quiet part of the energy transformation. It’s not driven by splashy federal programs or massive new infrastructure. It’s driven by sector experts, developers, manufacturers and service providers, who see opportunity in efficiency and resilience.

Commercial customers are proving that when you give them the tools and incentives to control their energy destiny, they’ll deliver stability, flexibility and value not just for themselves, but for the grid as a whole.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/OtMknGSnIDYPuJ1hTQ__dHZpJPa62J_WFdaj_nFChH8/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9pc3RvY2stMTMyMjU1MDc3NV9wcm9jZXNzZWQuanBn.webp,N,,2025-11-17 19:01:47.751881

Glasier, president and CEO of Western Uranium & Vanadium Corp., has a story that mirrors uranium’s history.
The company now has large uranium reserves, mostly in Colorado — more than any other firm in the state, according to Glaiser.
Restarting old mines is considerably cheaper and there’s plenty of uranium left in them he noted.
Rep. Jeff Hurd, who represents the 3rd Congressional District, recently toured the future Western Uranium & Vanadium processing site near Nucla with Grant and George Glasier.","Uranium mining in Colorado has a bright future.

George Glasier believes that.

From his cattle ranch near Nucla, Colo., where sagebrush valleys give way to rugged canyons, Glasier leads a company working to restart old uranium mines and build a new ore processing plant.

This push comes at a pivotal time for an industry that’s endured decades of booms and busts.

Uranium, the key material for nuclear power, was recently reclassified as a “critical mineral” by the U.S. Geological Survey under an executive order from President Donald Trump, who said he wants to “unleash” American energy. Formerly classified as a fuel source, uranium miners and refiners have not been eligible for the same kinds of taxpayer support offered to other mineral suppliers.

This designation acknowledges uranium’s vital role in clean energy, national security and the economy, especially as the U.S. seeks to cut reliance on foreign supplies. The change is intended to speed up approvals for mining projects and unlock federal funding, such as grants or loans — a potential game-changer for Colorado’s uranium sector.

Glasier, president and CEO of Western Uranium & Vanadium Corp., has a story that mirrors uranium’s history. After law school, he worked in real estate before entering mining in the 1970s. He joined Energy Fuels, a company that became the biggest uranium producer in the U.S., selling to power plants worldwide.

Though no one was harmed, the Three Mile Island accident in 1979 scared people, leading to increased safety and environmental regulations from nuclear regulators that all but halted construction of nuclear power plants for decades, according to the World Nuclear Association.

Uranium prices tanked, going below $10 per pound for years, and mines throughout the U.S. closed. Glasier left the business, bought his ranch at age 48, and learned ranching on the fly.

“Didn’t know much, but it worked for 33 years,” he said in a recent interview with The Denver Gazette.

Uranium pulled him back in 2005, when he started a new company. By 2014, he had formed Western Uranium & Vanadium and began buying old mine sites in Colorado and Utah, some of them from his former employer, Energy Fuels, which at the time was divesting some of its holdings.

The company now has large uranium reserves, mostly in Colorado — more than any other firm in the state, according to Glaiser.

At the heart of Glasier’s new energy empire is the Sunday Mine Complex in San Miguel County, a group of underground tunnels in canyon walls high above the Dolores River that were previously mined more than 3 miles back into the heart of the mesas above.

The complex’s mines operated from the 1950s to the mid-1980s, supplying uranium to the government, some of which Glaiser said created atomic bombs. After the federal government’s purchases for nuclear weapons programs ended in 1971, and after commercial exploitation of uranium under the Colorado Plateau through the 1980s ended, mines shut down when demand for uranium tanked. The Sunday Mine complex produced about 5 million pounds of uranium oxide, known as “yellowcake” for its bright yellow color, according to a 2015 technical report prepared for the company.

Western began rehabilitation and development of the mines in 2020, paused for COVID, and got going again in 2022.

The mine could run for 15-20 years, creating hundreds of jobs and boosting local economies in Montrose and San Miguel counties, said Glaiser.

But prices are still a hurdle. Uranium sells for about $80 a pound now, not enough to start entirely new mines.

Glasier said prices above $100 per pound would be necessary to open new mines. Restarting old mines is considerably cheaper and there’s plenty of uranium left in them he noted.

“Why sell cheap when it’ll cost more later?” Glasier asked.

Glasier estimates the U.S. could produce about half the uranium it needs in the next 10 years if prices justify it. Currently, however, domestic output meets only a tiny fraction of demand, with nearly all uranium being imported, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Studies from the Common Sense Institute, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development of the Nuclear Energy Agency, and the Colorado Geological Survey indicate that designating uranium as a critical mineral could generate up to $4.6 billion in annual economic output, support over 37,000 jobs, and revive rural Western communities impacted by coal mine closures through expanded mining and supply chains.

Glasier advocates for small nuclear reactors to provide steady power, especially as Colorado aims to attract tech companies needing reliable energy beyond wind and solar.

Western Uranium’s big plan includes a processing mill at Piñon Ridge, now renamed Mustang, near Bedrock. It’s close to the Sunday Mine, making it handy for turning ore into yellowcake.

But the site has a troubled past.

Proposed in 2007, it got a state license in 2013 after public meetings. Environmental groups sued, worried about water pollution, dust carrying radiation, and harm to wildlife and rivers.

In 2018, a Denver court ruled that the protections weren’t sufficient and canceled the license. The state followed suit, and no one appealed. Western bought the site in 2024 for about $2 million. Glasier said the company expects to file a new application by mid-2026, with hopes of opening by 2028.

Worries remain about health and the environment.

Rep. Jeff Hurd, who represents the 3rd Congressional District, recently toured the future Western Uranium & Vanadium processing site near Nucla with Grant and George Glasier.

“This facility is critical to reducing America’s dependence on foreign minerals and rare earth element processing, and to powering American energy dominance through safe, reliable, and clean nuclear energy,” said Hurd in a post on X.",https://www.denvergazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Side-drill-1-rotated-768x1024.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 19:01:52.390961

Protecting primary forests is not just an environmental imperative — it is a strategic policy decision with climate, economic and social benefits.","Primary forests are the heart of the global climate and biodiversity agenda, underpinning key international agreements such as the Paris Agreement and the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. These forests store dense carbon stocks while continuing to act as powerful carbon sinks. They also regulate water systems, reduce the risk of zoonotic disease, support livelihoods with essential resources, and provide irreplaceable habitat for countless species — many of them critically endangered and found nowhere else. Over 80 percent of terrestrial biodiversity lives in forests, and primary forests host the highest concentrations of species: especially those that are endemic, endangered or both. Primary forests fulfil a host of ecological functions, and the loss of these ecosystems is permanent — no restoration plan can replicate the complexity and resilience of intact forest landscapes within a reasonable timeframe, if ever.

Since 2001, the world has lost at least 83 million hectares of tropical primary forest and 50 million hectares of intact boreal forest. In 2024 alone, tropical primary forest loss exceeded 6.7 million hectares, releasing more than 3.1 gigatonnes of CO into the atmosphere — slightly more than India’s fossil fuel emissions that year. This marks a doubling of loss from 2023 and the highest annual rate in two decades — an alarming reversal of hard-won progress. Despite rising awareness, much of the global response remains misaligned and siloed. Although restoration efforts are extremely important to repairing functionality and restoring habitat in degraded areas and ought to be continually funded, these efforts should not be at the expense of preventing further deforestation and degradation of the primary forests that remain.

We cannot plant our way out of deforestation: prevention is more effective, more cost-efficient and ecologically far superior.

A fundamental shift is needed in both policy and finance frameworks concerned with forest ecosystem integrity which sustains primary forests. The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), through the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF), aims to protect 30% of the planet by 2030, and countries are striving to make progress towards this target. Fortunately, the CBD took critical steps both in Montreal and in Cali to integrate a clear and strong ecosystem integrity mandate into the GBF in Goal A, and Targets 1, 2, 8 and 12. Of course, the comprehensive focus on ecosystem integrity in the GBF by definition includes primary forests, but it is important to recognise this explicitly in the CBD at COP 17. The financial commitments made through CBD by countries earlier this year represent a critical milestone, but unless primary forests are explicitly prioritised in national strategies, we are sadly liable to continue seeing significant deforestation and degradation, as was the case in 2024. Similarly, the financial commitments made at UNFCCC COP29 represent an important step towards accelerating action to combat climate change — but primary forest conservation remains an overlooked solution within climate dialogues.

Where primary forests remain, governments must integrate primary forest protection into their international commitments and back those promises with legally binding safeguards, robust monitoring, enforceable protections, policy coherence and elimination of harmful incentives. In parallel, global finance must evolve. Current funding models fall short in prioritising conservation efforts with the highest ecological returns — leaving primary forests underfunded and exposing biodiversity, climate and communities to avoidable harm.

Beyond just a new policy, safeguarding primary forests demands an evolution of mindset: environmental protection isn’t a barrier to economic growth — it’s a value-add, a long-term investment in resilience, stability and prosperity of the planet.

These ecosystems are not liabilities to be cleared or degraded for development — they are assets, already delivering high-value ecological services that underpin healthy societies and healthy economies.

Innovative financial mechanisms can help close this gap. Redirecting climate finance toward avoided deforestation strategies, including payments to communities for ecosystem services and sovereign debt swaps for countries which steadfastly protect their primary forests, can unlock substantial resources to maintain and restore the ecosystem integrity of forests. Nations and communities demonstrating effective forest stewardship should be directly rewarded. Moreover, Indigenous Peoples and local communities who have stewarded these landscapes for generations offer robust networks and approaches for maintaining these landscapes, a fact which has been reinforced by decisions made at CBD COP16 last year. Their governance systems have proven effective at protecting primary forests for millennia, and they are to this day both dependents and stewards of these ecosystems. Securing Indigenous land rights and channelling direct financial support to Indigenous forest stewards is not only equitable — it is a proven conservation strategy.

Some global conservation initiatives are already pushing for these changes and are backed by funding from multilateral organisations. For example, the Global Environment Facility (GEF), which provides the largest funding for forest protection globally, supports the conservation of tropical primary forests as a priority globally - -notably through the Amazon, Congo and Other Critical Forest Biomes Integrated Program, endowed with $306 million grants leveraging in addition around $1.5 billion, as well as through other global projects executed by IUCN, Wild Heritage, Griffith University and other pioneering partners. These initiatives demonstrate that investing in primary forest integrity can simultaneously advance benefits for climate, biodiversity, people and economies, creating a win-win situation for everyone.

Protecting primary forests is not just an environmental imperative — it is a strategic policy decision with climate, economic and social benefits. Yet without immediate intervention, these ecosystems will continue to disappear, weakening global efforts to combat climate change and stem accelerating biodiversity loss. Policymakers must act to close policy gaps, realign and unlock financial flows, and position primary forests as foundational to global sustainability

35 states–including South Dakota’s neighbors North Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska and Wyoming–already exempt sales tax for capital-intensive industries like data centers.
South Dakota shouldn’t miss out in reaping the benefits for its citizens and helping advance U.S. dominance in innovation.","President Donald Trump has been clear in both his policies and rhetoric that he wants to help America win the next wave of technological innovation. But earlier this month, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang sounded the alarm to the Financial Times: “China is going to win the AI race.” A critical step to help realize the President’s vision is to build more data centers, and South Dakota can help.

In America, we need more digital infrastructure. Essential components of that infrastructure are more data centers. These facilities house all the cloud storage for Americans and our businesses, and as we continue to use more tech tools, our need for more data centers grows. President Trump recognizes this need and is championing the rapid build-out of U.S. data centers for AI infrastructure, streamlining permitting and incentivizing investment so America creates good jobs and leads the global technology race. However, there have been three rising challenges to this build-out of critical digital infrastructure which must be addressed. Much of the information circulating on these topics as they relate to data centers is misleading at best: energy consumption, water use and taxes.

Data Centers Help Reduce Everyone Else’s Electricity Bills

By helping the state’s electrical utilities to modernize South Dakota’s grid, hyperscale data centers can build new power generation and transmission that improves reliability. At the same time, these large-load data centers will pay a greater share of the utilities’ fixed costs. This puts downward pressure on electricity bills for households.

New research for the U.S. Department of Energy by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found higher load growth from industries like data centers reduces electricity prices for other customers.

Berkeley’s research was featured in a Washington Post article, “There’s a reason electricity prices have been rising. And it’s not data centers.” Berkeley Labs found that North Dakota, which experienced a 40% increase in electricity demand thanks to new data centers, saw real electricity prices fall by 3 cents per kilowatt-hour. And Virginia, home to more data centers than anyone in the world, experienced a 14% increase in demand and a price drop of 1 cent per kilowatt-hour.

Berkeley Labs found that North Dakota, which experienced a 40% increase in electricity demand thanks to new data centers, saw real electricity prices fall by 3 cents per kilowatt-hour.

Moreover, in their 2024 study of Virginia’s data center industry, the Joint Legislative Audit Review Commission (JLARC) found that Virginia ratepayers are not footing the bill for data centers, and that the State Corporation Commission has the tools to continue to ensure ratepayer protection. According to Kansas electric utility Evergy, “Large load customers, including data centers, absorb a greater share of the fixed costs of operating grid infrastructure (power plants, poles and wires), thus lowering rates for all customers.”

Data centers invest in the local grid, bringing lower electricity bills and more reliable energy for South Dakota businesses and households.

Data Centers Use Less Water Than a Courthouse or Office Building

Many new large-scale data centers will consume less water than your average courthouse or office by using a high-tech version of the electricity-powered air conditioning similar to that which cools our homes, schools and businesses.

In the parts of South Dakota where water is abundant, new data centers could use evaporative cooling on the warmest days of the year to reduce electricity demand. In those data centers, some of the water would evaporate into the skies above South Dakota, just like an irrigated cornfield, reservoir or golf course. The water that doesn’t evaporate is then returned to the municipal system or aquifer, as approved by local and state water authorities. This efficient technology ensures that local water resources are used smartly and sparingly to protect the community’s water supply.

Virginia again leads by example on getting to the root of this issue. Being the state with the most data centers in the country, it performed a state audit that found that the data centers using water do so in a sustainable and well-regulated manner.

Data Center Property Taxes Provide Relief for Residential Taxpayers and New Community Investment

Sales tax is commonly exempted for manufacturing inputs and equipment. 35 states–including South Dakota’s neighbors North Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska and Wyoming–already exempt sales tax for capital-intensive industries like data centers. Hyperscale data centers are not built in states where they’re disproportionately taxed due to an outdated tax code, so without modernization, South Dakota will lose investment, jobs, and tax revenue to other states.

Moreover, data center builders bring substantial new property tax revenue to the communities where they locate, which provides property tax relief for homeowners, and funds local schools and infrastructure projects. This modernization brings an increase in property tax revenue for cities and counties. For example, Virginia’s data center industry contributes $9 billion to the state’s GDP and funds local schools and infrastructure. Virginia’s Loudoun County states that data center tax revenue “has enabled the county to reduce the real property tax rate for homeowners every year for the past decade.”

Virginia’s Loudoun County states that data center tax revenue “has enabled the county to reduce the real property tax rate for homeowners every year for the past decade.”

Modernizing South Dakota’s tax code to attract new industries like data centers will keep the Mount Rushmore State competitive with its neighbors and attract good jobs, investment and new property tax revenues.

As President Trump noted in July, “We believe that America’s destiny is to dominate every industry and be the first in every technology.” Data centers, essential digital infrastructure for the next generation of technological advancement, have already contributed 4.7 million American jobs and nearly $800 billion per year to our economy.

“Our findings paint a grim picture: a toxic combination of increasing energy prices, rising overdue balances, and squeezed household budgets that together are pushing families deeper and deeper into debt,” The Century Foundation wrote.

“Furthermore, soaring utility bills are the tip of the iceberg for millions of Americans already overburdened by rising costs for health care, groceries, rent, child care, education, and more.”

Late balances for utility bills outpaced inflation 2.7 times during the studied period, according to the think tank. It said that Black families were three times more likely to have an overdue balance than white ones, noting that Black and Asian households also had the highest late bills.

“Energy insecurity follows the same racial fault lines as broader economic inequality, leaving communities of color more exposed to high balances and with less access to assistance,” The Century Foundation explained.

Late balances for families with well-below-average credit scores increased by 30% during the studied period, the organization added. Those households were disproportionately in urban and low-income neighborhoods, according to the think tank.

“These consumers are being especially pressed by the high cost of housing, food, child care, and transportation – and too often there’s not enough left over to pay the utility bill,” The Century Foundation said. “Not only does this leave them vulnerable to power cuts, but also it can be one more factor that further increases their cost of living and makes them vulnerable to having to take on new, costly debt just to make ends meet.”

The organization accused the Trump administration of failing to address the root causes of “energy inflation” and hindering the development of renewable energy.

President Donald Trump has targeted renewable energy projects by reducing federal support for them. He has said that sources like wind and solar are unreliable and worse options than oil and gas, which he claims are more beneficial for the economy.

The first day of his second term, Trump issued an executive order to protect the country’s “economic and national security” and “military preparedness” by making sure an “abundant” supply of reliable energy was available in every state.

“It is thus in the national interest to unleash America’s affordable and reliable energy and natural resources. This will restore American prosperity —- including for those men and women who have been forgotten by our economy in recent years,” the president said. “It will also rebuild our Nation’s economic and military security, which will deliver peace through strength.”",https://wpde.com/resources/media/5f1f45d9-e3d0-4bcb-9bca-575bccbe40ee-GettyImages2165132907.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 16:01:55.671537

The proposed rule would dramatically narrow which waters are covered by federal safeguards, leaving many wetlands and headwaters vulnerable to pollution and destruction. These waters are vital for filtering drinking water, reducing flood and drought risks, and sustaining wildlife—but under the planned rule, many of them would no longer be protected.

NRDC’s 2025 GIS analysis found that between 38 million and 70 million acres of wetlands are at risk of pollution or destruction under modeled scenarios similar to the changes the proposal includes.

“This is a reckless giveaway to polluters,” says Andrew Wetzler, senior vice president, Nature, at NRDC. “By gutting protections for wetlands and streams, the EPA is trying to disown its legal obligation to protect our drinking water and our communities. For the millions of Americans who swim or fish in our nation’s rivers and lakes, this is a bracing slap in the face. Wetlands are nature’s safeguard against flooding, and stripping away protections for them puts millions of people in harm’s way. At a time when climate change is fueling stronger storms and worsening floods, taking away these protections is not just shortsighted—it’s dangerous.”

“The EPA’s proposal is an extreme and unscientific exploitation of an already extreme and unscientific Supreme Court ruling,” says Jon Devine, director of freshwater ecosystems at NRDC. “Erasing protections for wetlands and streams that clearly affect downstream water quality and community safety ignores decades of hydrological science and will create regulatory chaos, leaving businesses, farmers, and communities with less certainty while exposing waters to more pollution.”

“Instead of undermining the Clean Water Act, the EPA should be building durable, science-based safeguards that honor both the law and the realities of how water moves across the landscape,” Devine says.

Background:

The EPA’s new proposed rule sharply narrows which wetlands and streams are protected under the Clean Water Act. The proposed rule would limit federal safeguards only to wetlands that hold surface water during the “wet season” and directly touch a water body like a river or stream that has continuous water flowing or standing during that “wet season.”

This approach excludes many critical wetlands and seasonal streams—waters that are essential for drinking water supplies, flood control, and ecosystem health.",https://www.nrdc.org/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-17 16:01:04.690201

Policymakers across the political spectrum increasingly agree that modernizing the federal permitting process is essential to deploying energy infrastructure at the pace and scale needed to meet U.S. economic, environmental, and energy security goals. Despite this growing consensus, questions remain about the most effective options to make permitting more predictable, coordinated, and timely while maintaining key environmental safeguards and opportunities for public input.

As part of its ongoing effort to explore bipartisan approaches to permitting reform, the Bipartisan Policy Center convened a roundtable in October 2025 to discuss key provisions in the House of Representatives’ bipartisan Simplifying Permitting for Efficient and Effective Deployment (SPEED) Act. The roundtable focused on the version of the legislation introduced in July 2025 by Natural Resources Committee Chairman Bruce Westerman (R-AR) and Rep. Jared Golden (D-ME). The legislation proposes a range of reforms aimed at improving the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) permitting process, updating judicial review standards, and strengthening project certainty across federal agencies. The roundtable was composed of more than forty experts in energy and the intersection of energy and environmental issues, and conversation largely centered on those areas.

Participants broadly agreed that the current permitting system for critical energy infrastructure projects is too slow and unpredictable, and that reforms to NEPA and judicial review could meaningfully improve permitting timelines and project certainty. Participants largely supported the overall direction and intent of the SPEED Act, particularly the provisions designed to streamline environmental reviews by setting clearer limits on which environmental effects agencies must study, and to reduce litigation-driven delays. However, there was significant debate over the details, especially concerning the precision of statutory language, the balance between efficiency and environmental oversight, and the degree to which Congress should limit judicial remedies—such as injunctions or vacating permits.

While perspectives varied, the roundtable discussion reflected a shared commitment to improving the permitting process. Participants emphasized that careful drafting and bipartisan coordination are essential to ensure that any reforms—whether through the SPEED Act or a broader legislative package—strengthen efficiency and accountability, and are durable across several administrations and Congresses.

This roundtable builds on BPC’s continuing work to evaluate pragmatic permitting solutions. Previous discussions in this series have focused on various permitting subtopics, such as community engagement, linear infrastructure, and reforms to the Clean Water Act. Together, these convenings aim to identify realistic pathways toward a permitting reform framework that accelerates energy deployment while preserving public trust in environmental decision-making.

This roundtable discussion focused on 18 specific reforms proposed in the SPEED Act. The issue brief will summarize the discussion and areas of consensus and divergent opinions among the participants present.

NEPA Reforms

Policy Option 1: Clarify that NEPA is a procedural statute only and does not mandate specific environmental outcomes.

The National Environmental Policy Act, the first major environmental law in the United States, was signed by President Richard Nixon on January 1, 1970. The statute emerged amid growing public concern about air and water pollution, oil spills, and habitat destruction. These pressures pushed policymakers to recognize that federal decisions on infrastructure, development, and resource use could cause long-term damage to both natural and human environments, and that the government needed a more deliberate process for evaluating those impacts.

NEPA requires federal agencies to assess and disclose the environmental consequences of major actions before making decisions. The law established a framework for environmental reviews. Under this framework, agencies prepare environmental impact statements (EISs) for actions expected to have significant impacts and environmental assessments (EAs), which are categories of actions that the agency has determined do not normally have significant environmental impacts. Agencies may also rely on categorical exclusions (CEs), which are categories of actions that the agency has determined not to have significant environmental effects. Because CEs are defined in advance and grounded in experience, projects that fit within an existing CE can move through the NEPA process quicker, when compared to EISs and EAs.

Over time, NEPA’s scope and impact have evolved as courts, agencies, and regulators have expanded the scope of analysis required under the statute. Judicial interpretations have broadened what constitutes “significant” environmental effects, while agencies have conducted extensive and time-consuming reviews, mainly in an attempt to avoid or successfully defend against legal challenges. These trends have added layers of complexity to the process and resulted in longer review timelines and greater project uncertainty. As BPC’s SPEED Act explainer notes, the legislation clarifies that NEPA is a procedural statute that does not mandate any specific environmental outcomes.

Roundtable participants debated whether explicitly codifying that NEPA is a procedural statute would meaningfully improve permitting outcomes or simply reaffirm existing precedent (e.g., Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County (1970). Several participants noted that courts have long recognized NEPA as a procedural law and questioned whether legislative clarification would have any practical effect. Some suggested such clarification could help restore predictability and constrain the trend toward ever-expanding reviews. A few participants cautioned, however, that the courts and the public could interpret the effort to reaffirm NEPA’s original purpose as weakening environmental protection or limiting agencies’ flexibility to address new information or community concerns.

Overall, the roundtable agreed that NEPA should remain focused on transparency and informed decision-making rather than being the sole determiner of outcomes. Most participants supported reaffirming NEPA’s procedural foundation in principle, but opinions were split on whether doing so through legislation would offer tangible benefits.

Policy Option 2: Limit the scope of review to effects that are reasonably foreseeable and proximately caused by the project, excluding speculative or attenuated impacts, impacts separate in time or place, or those tied to separate projects.

Since NEPA’s enactment in 1970, both court decisions and agency practice, guided in part by CEQ’s 1978 regulations, have expanded what qualifies as an “effect”. Early cases like Calvert Cliffs’ Coordinating Committee v. Atomic Energy Commission (1971) required agencies to evaluate the environmental consequences of their actions. CEQ’s regulations, which for decades have shaped how executive agencies structure their NEPA processes, incorporated that approach by calling for the analysis of direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts. Although this more expansive practice strengthened environmental accountability, it has also broadened the scope of review beyond what some believe Congress originally intended and has contributed to lengthier permitting processes. The SPEED Act attempts to address this issue by clarifying that environmental review should focus on effects that are reasonably foreseeable and proximately caused by a project, excluding speculative or remote impacts.

Roundtable participants generally supported focusing environmental reviews on effects that are direct and foreseeable, but they raised concerns about how the proposed statutory language would function in practice. Many described the language as overly broad and imprecise, noting that it could create new uncertainty rather than streamline the review process. One participant observed that every effect could be thought of as separate in time and place. Some participants cautioned that the use of the word “limit” could be interpreted too narrowly and exclude legitimate analysis of indirect or cumulative effects that are often necessary to understand a project’s overall environmental impact.

Participants emphasized that this policy option’s effectiveness would depend on precise drafting in the legislation and clear guidance to agencies. Some warned that ambiguous or open-ended language could invite litigation over the scope of analysis and ultimately undermine the policy option’s goal of improving efficiency. Overall, thereF was broad agreement that clarifying NEPA’s scope could be helpful, but most participants viewed this policy option as too imprecise to achieve that goal without unintended consequences.

Policy Option 3: Allow the review process conducted under other federal statutes to satisfy NEPA review requirements.

NEPA reviews often overlap with other environmental statutes that impose similar requirements. For example, a single project may trigger review under the Clean Water Act for discharges, the Endangered Species Act for impacts on protected species, and the Clean Air Act for emissions. Each statute has its own standards, timelines, and administrative processes, often involving separate documentation, interagency consultations, and public comment periods. This overlap can result in duplicative analysis where multiple agencies examine the same environmental impacts under different statutes.

Participants generally viewed this policy option as a practical step toward reducing duplication in agency reviews. They noted, however, that the policy option lacks a clear process for determining when another statute’s review would be considered functionally equivalent to NEPA. One participant urged creating a transparent process for determining equivalence and pointed out that without it, this policy option could itself become a litigation magnet. Other participants noted that it was unclear which agencies would make the equivalence determination and how much detail would be required to demonstrate it. As an example to follow, participants pointed to the permitting process for Class VI wells in which the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) gives primacy to states.

Overall, participants supported the policy option’s intent and agreed that clarifying when and how existing federal reviews can satisfy NEPA requirements could help reduce redundant analysis, if the legislation clearly defines the process for establishing equivalence.

Policy Option 4: Allow state or tribal reviews to satisfy NEPA requirements if these reviews determine that applicants have met NEPA standards.

This option builds on policy option three’s discussion of functional equivalence among federal statutes by extending the same concept to state and tribal environmental reviews. In some cases, states already conduct assessments that are similar in scope to NEPA, such as California’s Environmental Quality Act. This option aims to clarify that federal agencies could rely on these state or tribal reviews—when they meet NEPA standards—thereby avoiding repetitive review of the same project impacts.

Some participants suggested that if a state process is functionally equivalent to NEPA, a federal agency should be able to rely on that analysis to avoid duplication. Others cautioned that this could disincentivize states from reforming their own review processes and argued that the federal government should focus on improving NEPA rather than relying on varying state standards. Discussion on this policy option was brief, with one participant expressing support while another questioned whether it could backfire, depending on which agency determines equivalence. Overall, most participants emphasized that the onus should be on the federal government to improve NEPA.

Policy Option 5: Prohibit agencies from rescinding or altering completed environmental documents unless ordered to do so by a court.

Under current practice, federal agencies can revisit or withdraw previously finalized environmental documents or project approvals, sometimes following changes in presidential administration or policy direction. These reversals require project sponsors to repeat parts of the review process or halt construction despite having completed the required environmental reviews. These follow-up actions can increase uncertainty and project risk, increase costs, undermine long-term planning, and discourage investment.

Participants broadly supported efforts to strengthen project certainty and prevent completed environmental reviews from being reopened or withdrawn without cause. Several described this policy option as an important way to ensure stability across administrations and to give developers confidence that projects can move forward once reviews are complete. However, several participants emphasized that precise statutory language would be essential to make this provision effective and to avoid unintended consequences. A few participants questioned whether such language would actually prevent bad-faith rescissions, as agencies could still find other avenues to reopen reviews, and they suggested including an option requiring project sponsors to concur when an agency identifies a genuine error.

Policy Option 6: Require statements of purpose and need in environmental documents to align with the goals of the project applicant.

Under NEPA, an agency’s statement of purpose and need defines the objectives of a proposed project and guides the range of alternatives analyzed in an EA or EIS. In practice, agencies must evaluate a range of alternatives that could meet those objectives, including the project proposed by the applicant, a “no action” option, and other feasible approaches. When the agency defines the purpose differently than the applicant, it can expand the scope of alternatives, lengthen review timelines, and create tension over whether the agency has effectively redefined the project itself.

The SPEED Act includes this policy option to clarify that purpose and need statements should align with the applicant’s goals. This would ensure that agencies evaluate alternatives relevant to the project being proposed rather than redefining its objectives.

Participants discussed whether this policy option would appropriately balance agency authority with applicant goals. One participant cited Burlington v. Busey (1990), noting that courts have found agency authority to be primary in defining a project’s purpose. They cautioned that writing applicant goals directly into statute could invite courts or agencies to interpret the provision as a mandate to defer to the applicant’s definition in all circumstances, potentially constraining legitimate agency discretion. Several participants cautioned that a strained civil service capacity could also complicate implementation. Others agreed that while agency authority should remain primary, agencies should also consider the applicant’s goals when determining whether a project falls within their statutory authority. Overall, participants agreed that the underlying problem is real, but several were unsure whether this policy option was the right statutory fix.

Policy Option 7: Allow deadline extensions only with a project applicant’s approval.

NEPA includes statutory time limits for environmental reviews—generally, one year for EAs and two years for EISs—as established by the 2023 Fiscal Responsibility Act. Under current law, those deadlines may be extended only with the approval of the project applicant, after consultation with cooperating agencies. The SPEED Act builds on those provisions by specifying that any extensions to those timelines can be granted only with the approval of the project applicant. Supporters view this as a way to give developers greater certainty over project timelines and to discourage unnecessary delays, while maintaining flexibility for cases where additional time is genuinely needed.

Participants discussed how this policy option would interact with existing statutory timelines and agency practice. Several participants raised broader questions about whether deadlines are effective at all and whether this policy option is needed. Some cautioned that stricter limits could push more NEPA work into the preapplication period, effectively hiding how long reviews take. Others suggested that pairing firm timelines with stronger judicial review provisions could make the process more effective. Overall, participants agreed that the policy option’s intent to enhance accountability and predictability was sound, but views differed on whether requiring applicant approval would meaningfully improve review timelines.

Policy Option 8: Agencies do not have to undertake or consider new studies after an application is submitted or a notice of intent is issued.

This provision in the SPEED Act is intended to prevent permitting delays that occur when agencies initiate or evaluate new studies after a project application has been submitted or a notice of intent has been issued. In current practice, new information, such as recently published studies or data, can prompt additional analysis or supplemental environmental documents and extend review timelines. This policy option intends to provide greater certainty by clarifying that agencies are not obligated to undertake or consider new studies introduced after the review process has formally begun.

Participants expressed a mix of support and concern regarding this policy option. Several agreed that the intent was sensible and could help reduce delays. Others worried that the language might be interpreted too broadly and would prevent agencies from considering new information that could materially affect environmental outcomes. Furthermore, some participants noted that this policy option could create confusion about how agencies should handle studies completed after a draft EIS is issued. Overall, participants agreed that while the goal of improving timeliness was sound, careful drafting would be needed to ensure that agencies retain the ability to consider relevant new information when appropriate. Last, some participants recommended tying the cutoff to the issuance of a draft EIS, which they viewed as a more defensible point to limit new information.

Policy Option 9: Require agencies not to delay review to await anticipated new studies.

Environmental reviews under NEPA can take years to complete, and one contributing factor is agencies delaying action while awaiting anticipated new studies, datasets, or modeling results. Such delays can extend project timelines even when the existing information is sufficient to complete the review. The SPEED Act includes this policy option to clarify that agencies should proceed with their analysis using currently available information rather than pausing to await future studies.

Participants discussed this policy option briefly. Some viewed it as a logical companion to the previous provision on new studies, intended to prevent agencies from using anticipated research as a reason to postpone project reviews. However, others questioned whether the intent was to avoid unnecessary delays or to permit agencies to disregard potentially relevant information. The roundtable ultimately did not reach consensus on this policy option.

Policy Option 10: Extend the window of programmatic EIS/EA documents from five years to 10 years, subject to reevaluation.

A programmatic environmental impact statement or environmental assessment analyzes the environmental effects of a broader policy, program, plan, or group of related actions rather than a single project. These documents allow agencies to “tier” subsequent, project-specific reviews from the broader analysis. Agencies generally reevaluate programmatic analyses every five years to determine whether new circumstances or information require supplementation.

The SPEED Act would double this window and extend the period in which agencies may rely on a programmatic document from five years to 10 years. The goal is to reduce the frequency of reevaluations, improve predictability, and allow agencies to extend the use of resource-intensive programmatic analyses.

Participants had mixed opinions on this policy option. Some supported it, describing it as a straightforward improvement that would make programmatic reviews more useful. A few participants questioned whether extending the timeframe would make a significant difference in practice and pointed out the difficulty in predicting future conditions.

Several participants suggested that programmatic reviews could be especially valuable for energy transition minerals (such as lithium, nickel, cobalt, and rare earth elements used in the production of clean energy technologies), where environmental conditions and resource locations are unlikely to change significantly over a decade. One participant noted that landscapes involving nickel or other mineral deposits evolve slowly, making a 10-year window appropriate. Overall, most agreed that this policy option would reduce administrative burdens, while others felt this policy option was not particularly important.

Policy Option 11: Allow agencies to adopt categorical exclusions established by agencies, including those legislated by Congress.

Under current practice, agencies may adopt CEs in another agency’s NEPA procedures if they determine that it fits their own activities and complies with applicable requirements. Although CEQs guidance has historically shaped how agencies develop and use CEs, the Supreme Court’s recent Seven Counties decision has clarified that CEQ’s regulations do not carry binding force for all federal agencies. As a result, agency-specific NEPA procedures, rather than CEQ regulations, now govern the establishment and application of CEs.

The SPEED Act would expand existing authority by allowing agencies to apply CEs that were created by Congress for another agency. For example, a statutory CE created by Congress for the Department of Transportation could be applied by the Department of Energy (DOE) for a similar class of infrastructure projects. This change aims to reduce duplication and streamline reviews by allowing agencies to rely on statutory CEs rather than conducting new analyses for similar actions.

Participants generally viewed this policy option favorably. Several said it would reduce redundant analysis and improve efficiency by allowing agencies to make use of CEs that Congress has already designated. There was no significant opposition, and participants characterized the policy option as a practical step to streamlining permitting.

Policy Option 12: Narrow the definition of “major federal action.”

Under NEPA, environmental review is required for “major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the environment.” This phrase determines when NEPA applies, and its interpretation has long been debated. There is no definition of “major federal action” within NEPA, although the recent Fiscal Responsibility Act added a list of actions that are explicitly not considered major federal actions. The SPEED Act would modify and expand that list.

Under current law, certain forms of federal assistance are excluded from NEPA when the federal agency lacks sufficient control over the project. The SPEED Act would tighten this standard by specifying that such assistance is not a major federal action unless the agency has “complete control and responsibility” over the project; it would also add grants, farm loans, and guarantees to the list of excluded actions and clarify that federal funding alone does not trigger NEPA.

Participants widely agreed that the goal of this policy option is important but raised concerns about the proposed language. Several commented that “complete control” seemed too narrow and could create loopholes that allow agencies to avoid environmental review. A participant noted that narrowing the definition of a major federal action could have potential consequences, such as allowing the federal government to avoid NEPA for projects in which it has substantial involvement (e.g., “Alligator Alcatraz”) or for other projects where agencies provide significant funding or approvals but could still claim they lack “complete control and responsibility.” This could create pathways to bypass NEPA despite meaningful federal influence over a project’s outcome.

Participants pointed out that DOE and other agencies often enter into cooperative agreements, where the federal government exercises significant but not complete control. Some supported this change, questioning whether projects receiving federal cost shares should be treated differently from identical projects developed without federal funding.

Additionally, some participants argued that NEPA should apply when federal funding influences project design or siting decisions, but not when funds are distributed after a project is already planned or underway. One participant cited as a potential model certain thresholds at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, where projects below 5% federal funding typically do not trigger NEPA, those between 5% and one-third are decided on a case-by-case basis, and those above one-third normally require review.

A few participants emphasized the need to explicitly define “major federal action” in statute to avoid decades of inconsistent case law and administrative interpretation. Others urged “not to let the perfect be the enemy of the good,” noting that this provision in the SPEED Act could incentivize greater cooperation between developers and agencies even if it does not fully resolve the issue.

Policy Option 13: Add “energy” to CEQ’s list of national policy goals, alongside conservation, social, economic, and health.

The Council on Environmental Quality issues governmentwide NEPA guidance and maintains a statement of environmental policy goals that federal agencies often use to inform their decision-making. These goals emphasize the conservation of natural resources, the balance of economic and environmental priorities, and the promotion of social and health welfare. The SPEED Act would add “energy” to the list of national policy goals. The intent is to recognize energy development as a core national objective and ensure it is considered in federal decision-making processes.

Most participants viewed this policy option favorably, describing it as a symbolic but useful acknowledgment of energy’s important role in national policy. Several noted that energy could already fall under the existing “economic” goal but agreed that explicitly naming it could help guide how agencies balance priorities.

Judicial Review Reforms

Policy Option 14: Establish a two-part test for overturning agency actions.

Under the Administrative Procedure Act, courts overturn agency decisions if they find them “arbitrary and capricious.” In practice, this has allowed courts to vacate permits even for procedural NEPA errors that may have no bearing on an agency’s final decision. To address this issue, the SPEED Act would establish a stricter, two-part test for judicial review: A court could overturn or reject an agency decision based on its noncompliance with NEPA only if it finds both that the agency “abused its substantial discretion” when rendering its decision, and that its decision would have been different but for that abuse of discretion. In short, the goal is to limit judicial intervention to truly consequential NEPA analytical and decisional errors and provide greater project certainty once reviews are complete.

Participants viewed this option as a major change that would raise the bar for overturning agency decisions. Several described the second part—requiring proof that the outcome would have changed but for the agency’s NEPA error—as the most important feature, as it would prevent costly injunctions and remands (when a court sends a decision back to an agency) when a procedural flaw has no decisive effect. Others questioned what “abuse of substantial discretion” means as a legal standard and whether it merely restates the existing “arbitrary and capricious” test.

Some participants supported this policy option in principle but worried that the threshold could be too high and could make it difficult to correct genuine deficiencies in environmental reviews. Overall, the group agreed that the policy option aims to reduce unnecessary litigation and improve predictability, but many emphasized that its effectiveness would depend on how courts interpret and apply the new standard.

Policy Option 15: Prohibit courts from substituting their judgment on environmental effects for that of the agency.

Under NEPA, courts sometimes evaluate not just whether an agency followed proper procedures but whether its conclusions about environmental impacts were reasonable. This review can allow judges to second-guess technical decisions and effectively redo an agency’s analysis. The second-guessing can contribute to uncertainty and inconsistency across jurisdictions. To address this issue, the SPEED Act clarifies that courts may not substitute their own judgment for that of the agency when they review environmental effects.

Participants expressed mixed views on this policy option. Several questioned how courts could determine whether an agency would have reached a different decision (the standard set forth in Policy Option 14 above) without substituting their own judgment—a contradiction between the policy options that one participant described as “impossible to reconcile.” Others felt the language simply restated existing practice, noting that the Supreme Court’s recent Seven Counties decision reaffirmed that NEPA is a procedural statute and that courts may not second-guess an agency’s expert technical judgments so long as the agency has taken a ‘hard look’. A few participants appreciated the intent to limit unnecessary judicial intervention but doubted this language would be effective in doing so, as judges would likely interpret it inconsistently.

Policy Option 16: Limit court remedies to remand with instructions and deadlines (judges could not issue injunctions or vacate permits).

Currently, when courts find a violation under NEPA, they can vacate the permit or issue injunctions while agencies correct deficiencies in their analyses. These remedies can add to project costs even if the judicially determined defect is procedural or would not change the agency’s permitting decision. The SPEED Act would limit courts to remanding a case to the agency with instructions specifying what needs to be fixed in the analysis and a deadline of no more than 180 days. This approach is intended to provide greater project certainty by preventing minor issues from delaying project commencement.

Although many in the room favored the increased use of remand with instructions over injunctions or vacating permits, most participants opposed this policy option as written. Several said that if courts cannot vacate permits or issue injunctions, NEPA would be left without any real enforcement power. Some argued that this remedy might not be sufficient when the bar for court action had been raised to “substantial abuse” by the relevant agency. Others agreed that while lengthy litigation can delay projects, they felt that this approach went beyond what could be supported in a bipartisan deal. Some participants argued that the policy option might help agencies and developers keep projects moving while minor issues are resolved. Overall, participants viewed this as one of the most controversial provisions in the SPEED Act.

Policy Option 17: Shorten the statute of limitations for NEPA challenges to 150 days.

Currently lawsuits challenging NEPA reviews can, in most cases, be filed up to six years after a permit approval. This leaves agencies and developers uncertain long after the review has been completed and a permit issued. The SPEED Act would shorten the statute of limitations for filing NEPA challenges to 150 days after the final agency action.

Every participant agreed with the intent of this policy option and described a three- to six-month window as reasonable. Overall, the consensus was that shortening the statute of limitations would help ensure earlier resolution of disputes and reduce project uncertainty.

Policy Option 18: Restrict standing to parties who submitted substantive, detailed comments during the public comment period.

Under current law, individuals and organizations can file NEPA lawsuits even if they did not participate during the public comment process. The SPEED Act would limit standing to parties that submitted unique, substantive, and detailed comments during the public comment period, raised the same issues in litigation, and can demonstrate direct harm.

Participants generally agreed that linking standing to participation during the public comment process could reduce unnecessary litigation and promote earlier engagement. Many pointed to the Fast-41 permitting framework as precedent for this type of reform but affirmed that the SPEED Act’s version appears more restrictive. Several participants warned that requiring both detailed comments and proof of harm could disadvantage smaller organizations, tribes, or under-resourced communities that lack the capacity to produce highly technical submissions. Others supported the idea in principle but said the timing of public comment opportunities, particularly if limited to the notice of intent stage, could further constrain meaningful participation. Overall, many participants supported the intention of this policy option but agreed that the current language may need to be adjusted to ensure communities can still access judicial review.

Conclusion

To improve the permitting process, roundtable participants agreed on the need to reform NEPA and judicial review. And participants mostly agreed that the SPEED Act’s policy options seek to solve real problems in the current system. Some of these options enjoyed consensus support, but others did not. Most importantly, participants agreed that improvements to NEPA and judicial review are necessary components of a broader permitting reform package that is also likely to include other key policies, such as project certainty and improvements to permitting for transmission and other linear infrastructure.

This roundtable builds on BPC’s ongoing work to develop pragmatic, bipartisan permitting solutions. Following this discussion on the SPEED Act’s NEPA and judicial review provisions, BPC will next convene a roundtable focused on project certainty and predictability, with a focus on the objective of ensuring that all project types are treated fairly and consistently across presidential administrations.",https://bipartisanpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Judge-Immigration-Backlog.png,N,,2025-11-17 16:00:53.038127

A 2023 Supreme Court decision had set the stage for the E.P.A.’s action by curtailing the agency’s power to police millions of acres of wetlands.
E.P.A., Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. wrote that the Clean Water Act allowed the agency to regulate only wetlands with a “continuous surface connection” to a “relatively permanent” body of water.
These changes could strip federal protections from up to 55 million acres of wetlands, or about 85 percent of all wetlands nationwide, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group.","The Trump administration proposed on Monday to significantly limit the Environmental Protection Agency’s authority to limit pollution in wetlands, rivers and other bodies of water across the country.

The proposed rule could strip federal protections from millions of acres of wetlands and streams, potentially threatening sources of clean drinking water for millions of Americans. It was a victory for a range of business interests that have lobbied to scale back the Clean Water Act of 1972, including farmers, home builders, real estate developers, oil drillers and petrochemical manufacturers.

“I know that across the country, news of today’s proposal is going to be met with a lot of relief from farmers, ranchers, other landowners and governments,” said Lee Zeldin, the E.P.A. administrator, during an event at the agency’s headquarters in Washington featuring Republican members of Congress and industry executives.

Under the Clean Water Act, companies and individuals must obtain a permit from the E.P.A. before releasing pollutants into the nation’s waterways. They must receive a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers before discharging any dredged or fill material, such as sand, silt or construction debris.

A 2023 Supreme Court decision had set the stage for the E.P.A.’s action by curtailing the agency’s power to police millions of acres of wetlands. In the majority opinion in Sackett v. E.P.A., Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. wrote that the Clean Water Act allowed the agency to regulate only wetlands with a “continuous surface connection” to a “relatively permanent” body of water.

But Justice Alito did not explicitly define a “relatively permanent” body of water. Now, the Trump administration is describing it as a body of water that flows either year-round or during the “wet season.”

The new definition would exclude wetlands that abut or touch many intermittent streams, which do not flow during dry periods. It also could exclude ephemeral streams, which sit dry for much of the year and fill up only after rainfall or snowmelt.

These changes could strip federal protections from up to 55 million acres of wetlands, or about 85 percent of all wetlands nationwide, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group.

“The administration is preparing to rip away protections from the vast majority of wetlands in the United States, which are the waters that protect our communities from floods, help filter drinking water and provide habitat for millions of birds and fish,” said Andrew Wetzler, senior vice president for nature at N.R.D.C.

Ephemeral streams can be small, but a recent study found that they provided about 55 percent of the water flowing through most river systems used in drinking water supplies.

“This rule will mean more unsafe drinking water and more expensive water treatment costs for taxpayers,” said Jim Murphy, senior director of legal advocacy at the National Wildlife Federation, a conservation group.

The National Association of Home Builders, an industry trade group, praised the Trump administration’s proposal, saying it would slash costs for builders and developers, potentially lowering the price of new homes. “This is a significant step toward reducing regulatory red tape, cutting permitting costs and lowering the cost of doing business in communities across the country — all while continuing to protect our nation’s vital waterways,” Buddy Hughes, chairman of the association, said in a statement.

Representative Bruce Westerman, Republican of Arkansas and chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources, said the proposal would help fix a “broken” permitting process in the United States. “We’re losing our ability to build things here in America,” he said at the E.P.A. event.

Ever since Congress passed the Clean Water Act to protect all “waters of the United States,” policymakers in Washington have been squabbling over how, exactly, to define those bodies of water.

In 2015, the Obama administration widened the law’s scope to cover smaller streams and headwaters. Several Republican-led states challenged the rule in court as an example of regulatory overreach, leading a federal judge to pause its implementation.

During Mr. Trump’s first term, the E.P.A. repealed the Obama-era rule and issued a weaker version. Then in 2023 the Supreme Court ruled in Sackett v. E.P.A., dealing a setback to the Biden administration’s efforts to again strengthen the regulation.

The Sackett case concerned an Idaho couple, Michael and Chantell Sackett, who sought to build a house on what an appeals court called “a soggy residential lot” near a lake. The E.P.A. determined that there were wetlands on the property, and it ordered the couple to stop construction or risk paying fines of more than $40,000 per day.

The Sacketts, represented by the conservative Pacific Legal Foundation, sued. The case reached the Supreme Court, which ruled that the couple’s 0.63-acre lot — and other properties like it nationwide — was not subject to federal oversight.

“This proposed rule is significant not just for small landowners like the Sacketts, but for all sectors of the regulated community, whether it’s agriculture or home construction or industrial development,” said Damien Schiff, a senior attorney with the Pacific Legal Foundation.

After the proposal is published in the Federal Register, the E.P.A. will solicit public comments for 45 days before finalizing the rule.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/08/multimedia/00cli-cleanwater-mkqh/00cli-cleanwater-mkqh-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 16:00:57.376217

Waterkeeper Alliance is sounding the alarm about the newly announced draft rule from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of the Army to revise the definition of the “waters of the United States” (WOTUS), which further undermines landmark clean water protections, threatening water quality across the United States.

By narrowing the scope of waters protected under the Clean Water Act, this reinterpretation removes federal safeguards from many rivers, streams, lakes, wetlands, and other vital waterways. Without oversight, these waters face increased risks from pollution, threatening clean drinking water, recreation, fisheries, and aquatic life.

The Clean Water Act has already been severely weakened following the Supreme Court’s 2023 decision in Sackett v. EPA, in which the Court dramatically revoked protections for thousands of bodies of water across the country. This new draft rule takes these rollbacks even further and follows EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin’s plans earlier this year to revise wastewater regulations for coal-burning power plants, roll back coal ash management regulations, and reconsider the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards. He has also withdrawn standards that could have cleaned up water pollution from slaughterhouses, announced plans to weaken PFAS drinking water standards, and ordered the closure of EPA offices responsible for addressing disproportionate pollution in low-income and rural communities and communities of color.

Collectively, these actions threaten to reverse more than five decades of progress to reduce highly toxic and dangerous pollutants from the environment and protect critical water resources from dangerous development projects.

“Every rollback threatens the water we drink, the rivers we fish, and the wetlands that protect our communities and ecosystems,” said Kelly Hunter Foster, Senior Attorney for Waterkeeper Alliance. “EPA’s new draft WOTUS rule continues to prioritize corporate interests by compromising the already weakened protections for thousands of water bodies across the country.

The Century Foundation, which focuses partially on economic equality, found that the average late balance on bills increased by nearly a third from early 2022 to this past summer.
Monthly energy bills rose 35% over the same period, and families can’t keep up with payments, the organization noted.
“Furthermore, soaring utility bills are the tip of the iceberg for millions of Americans already overburdened by rising costs for health care, groceries, rent, child care, education, and more.” Late balances for utility bills outpaced inflation 2.7 times during the studied period, according to the think tank.

“Our findings paint a grim picture: a toxic combination of increasing energy prices, rising overdue balances, and squeezed household budgets that together are pushing families deeper and deeper into debt,” The Century Foundation wrote.

“Furthermore, soaring utility bills are the tip of the iceberg for millions of Americans already overburdened by rising costs for health care, groceries, rent, child care, education, and more.”

Late balances for utility bills outpaced inflation 2.7 times during the studied period, according to the think tank. It said that Black families were three times more likely to have an overdue balance than white ones, noting that Black and Asian households also had the highest late bills.

“Energy insecurity follows the same racial fault lines as broader economic inequality, leaving communities of color more exposed to high balances and with less access to assistance,” The Century Foundation explained.

Late balances for families with well-below-average credit scores increased by 30% during the studied period, the organization added. Those households were disproportionately in urban and low-income neighborhoods, according to the think tank.

“These consumers are being especially pressed by the high cost of housing, food, child care, and transportation – and too often there’s not enough left over to pay the utility bill,” The Century Foundation said. “Not only does this leave them vulnerable to power cuts, but also it can be one more factor that further increases their cost of living and makes them vulnerable to having to take on new, costly debt just to make ends meet.”

The organization accused the Trump administration of failing to address the root causes of “energy inflation” and hindering the development of renewable energy.

President Donald Trump has targeted renewable energy projects by reducing federal support for them. He has said that sources like wind and solar are unreliable and worse options than oil and gas, which he claims are more beneficial for the economy.

The first day of his second term, Trump issued an executive order to protect the country’s “economic and national security” and “military preparedness” by making sure an “abundant” supply of reliable energy was available in every state.

“It is thus in the national interest to unleash America’s affordable and reliable energy and natural resources. This will restore American prosperity —- including for those men and women who have been forgotten by our economy in recent years,” the president said. “It will also rebuild our Nation’s economic and military security, which will deliver peace through strength.”",https://wsbt.com/resources/media/5f1f45d9-e3d0-4bcb-9bca-575bccbe40ee-GettyImages2165132907.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 17:02:27.383892

Toyota’s new US battery plant is set for an expansion

The first batteries rolled off the production line at Toyota’s new battery plant in Liberty, North Carolina, last Wednesday, marking a “pivotal moment” in the automaker’s nearly 70-year history in the US.

Toyota’s new plant houses 14 battery production lines, which will be used to power battery electric vehicles (BEVs), hybrids (HEVs), and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs).

At full capacity, the battery plant can produce 30 GWh per year. The plant is phasing in batteries imported from Japan through a joint venture with LG Electronics, which will power the Camry HEV, Corolla Cross HEV, and RAV4 HEV. It also ships hybrid battery modules to its Kentucky assembly plant and to another plant in Alabama, which it co-owns with Mazda.

Toyota’s battery plant is already massive, spanning about 121 football fields, but company executives are saying it will likely be even bigger than expected.

“Our plans are to go 70% electrified by 2030. So obviously that could fuel additional expansion here at the plant,” David Christ, head of the Toyota brand in North America, said during a media briefing on Wednesday (via Triad Business Journal) following a tour of the facility.

Building on its commitment, Toyota announced an additional $10 billion investment over the next five years in electrified mobility.

Toyota didn’t say exactly how it plans to invest the $10 billion, but the new battery plant is likely to see some of it. The battery modules that Toyota produces at the plant vary from hybrid to EV, but the cells are the same, enabling it to adjust based on demand.

It can also adapt to different battery types, which could possibly include solid-state batteries, according to Toyota’s plant president, Don Stewart.

Toyota, which has been one of the biggest laggards in the shift to all-electric vehicles, will continue pushing hybrids as it aims to overcome the new US tariffs.

The plant can supply batteries for around 600,000 hybrid vehicles a year while Toyota builds capacity for another 74,000 PHEVs and 45,000 EVs, including its first three-row electric SUV.

Starting next year, Toyota’s best-selling vehicle, the RAV4, will be sold exclusively as a hybrid. Toyota is also launching several new BEVs, including the C-HR and BZ Woodlands electric SUVs, as well as the 2026 electric Lexus ES.

Electrek’s Take

It’s not a surprise to see Toyota standing by hybrids at this point. What will be interesting is to see how Toyota’s new electric vehicles sell.

After solving many of the issues with its first EV, the bZ4X, will Toyota’s upcoming models sell? Several EVs, like the Hyundai IONIQ 5 and Chevy Equinox EV, have proven that an affordable electric car with enough range and features will sell.

With longer driving ranges, faster charging, and an improved interior and exterior design, Toyota’s upcoming electric vehicles are already a significant upgrade over the outgoing bZ4X. If Toyota sees EV sales improve, we could see production plans at the facility shift once again.",https://i0.wp.com/electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/Toyota-EV-battery-plant-bigger-1.jpg?resize=1200%2C628&quality=82&strip=all&ssl=1,N,,2025-11-17 15:02:59.558254

The electric vehicle industry's quest for supply chain independence faces ongoing hurdles as Syrah Resources and Tesla navigate their complex graphite supply partnership. The Australian mining company recently announced its second deadline extension in two months, pushing the material qualification timeline to January 16, 2026, highlighting the technical complexities of establishing domestic battery material production. This Syrah Resources Tesla graphite supply deal extension underscores the broader challenges facing critical minerals energy transition as automakers work to reduce dependence on Chinese-dominated markets.

This development demonstrates the broader challenges facing critical mineral supply chains as automakers work to reduce dependence on Chinese-dominated markets while establishing reliable domestic processing capabilities for electric vehicle batteries.

Understanding the Default Notice and Contractual Timeline Adjustments

Tesla issued a default notice in July 2024 regarding Syrah's alleged failure to deliver conforming active anode material samples from its Louisiana processing facility. The original September 16, 2024 cure date has now been extended twice, first to November 15, 2024, and subsequently to January 16, 2026.

Despite these extensions, Syrah maintains its position that it has not defaulted on the agreement terms. The company stated that while it does not accept being in default under the offtake agreement, both parties agreed to extend the cure date to provide additional time for material qualification.

The technical requirements center on delivering battery-grade active anode material that meets Tesla's specific conformance standards for electric vehicle battery integration. This involves transforming natural graphite from Syrah's Mozambique operations into processed material suitable for lithium-ion battery anodes at the Vidalia facility in Louisiana.

Critical Milestones and Final Qualification Requirements

The contractual framework establishes February 9, 2026 as the ultimate termination trigger date for Tesla. If final qualification of the plant's active anode material is not achieved by this date, Tesla retains the right to terminate the entire offtake agreement.

This creates a narrow window of approximately 24 days between the extended cure date and potential contract termination, indicating limited flexibility for further negotiations if qualification targets are not met. The material testing standards required for electric vehicle battery integration involve complex quality control benchmarks that must demonstrate consistent performance characteristics.

Strategic Importance of Domestic Graphite Supply Development

The partnership between Syrah Resources and Tesla represents a significant strategic initiative to establish domestic battery material production capacity. The 2021 contract commits to supplying 8,000 metric tons of graphite anode materials over a four-year period, translating to approximately 2,000 metric tons annually.

Breaking China's Market Dominance in Battery Materials

Syrah's Vidalia facility holds unique strategic value as the only vertically integrated, large-scale anode material producer outside China. This positioning directly addresses the challenge of Chinese supplies that dominate the global graphite anode market, creating supply chain vulnerabilities for Western electric vehicle manufacturers.

The facility's vertical integration means it combines both raw graphite processing and active anode material production in a single location, providing operational advantages over multi-stage processing arrangements that span different geographic regions. This integration model reduces logistical complexity and provides greater quality control throughout the production process.

Tesla's Multi-Sourcing Approach to Critical Components

Tesla's engagement with Syrah reflects a broader strategy to diversify critical battery component sourcing beyond traditional Chinese suppliers. This approach serves multiple objectives:

Risk mitigation through geographic distribution of suppliers

Supply chain transparency and quality control advantages

Long-term battery cost reduction through competitive sourcing

Alignment with U.S. policy objectives for domestic manufacturing

The partnership also demonstrates Tesla's commitment to supporting the development of domestic critical mineral processing infrastructure, even when technical qualification timelines extend beyond initial projections. Furthermore, companies are increasingly looking toward innovative solutions like the recent battery recycling breakthrough to enhance sustainability across the battery supply chain.

Technical Challenges in Natural Graphite Processing Operations

The transformation from raw graphite to battery-grade anode material involves complex processing requirements that present significant technical hurdles. Syrah must convert natural graphite extracted from its Balama operations in Mozambique into conforming active anode material that meets Tesla's lithium-ion battery specifications.

Complex Processing Requirements for Battery Integration

Active anode material production requires precise control of particle size distribution, surface chemistry, and electrochemical properties. The material must demonstrate consistent performance characteristics including:

Stable capacity retention over charge-discharge cycles

Appropriate electrical conductivity for lithium-ion insertion

Chemical purity standards for battery safety requirements

Structural integrity under operational stress conditions

The repeated deadline extensions suggest these technical specifications are more challenging to achieve consistently at commercial scale than initially anticipated. Quality specifications for lithium-ion battery applications involve stringent testing protocols that verify material performance under various operational conditions.

Geographic Integration Challenges Across Continents

Syrah manages a geographically distributed operation that spans Mozambique mining operations and Louisiana processing facilities. This arrangement requires reliable logistics coordination and quality control across international boundaries, creating additional complexity compared to single-region operations.

The integration between Balama graphite extraction and Vidalia processing involves maintaining material consistency throughout the supply chain, from raw ore extraction through final anode material production. Transportation logistics, quality preservation during shipping, and coordination between facilities on different continents add operational risk factors.

Impact of Operational Disruptions on Supply Chain Reliability

Recent operational challenges have demonstrated the vulnerability of geographically distributed critical mineral supply chains to political and economic instability. Syrah's operations faced significant disruptions in 2024 due to nationwide protests in Mozambique, affecting the Balama graphite extraction facility.

Mozambique Political Instability and Mining Operations

The Balama facility experienced operational disruptions during 2024 nationwide protests in Mozambique, highlighting the political risk factors associated with African mining operations. These disruptions affected raw material supply to the Louisiana processing facility, creating additional challenges for meeting Tesla's material qualification timeline.

To address these operational challenges, Syrah received $8.5 million under its United States International Development Finance Corporation loan facility in November 2024. This disbursement represents partial access to a total $150 million commitment designed to support operational stability at the Balama operations.

Financial Support Mechanisms and Strategic Importance

The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation's $150 million loan commitment reflects institutional recognition of the strategic importance of Balama operations to U.S. battery supply chain resilience. This government backing demonstrates policy-level support for establishing alternative sources of critical battery materials.

The DFC financing serves multiple purposes:

This strategic partnership between Australia's Syrah Resources and the electric vehicle giant represents more than a simple contract modification—it's a critical test of whether Western companies can successfully challenge Chinese dominance in battery material processing. Furthermore, the outcome will likely influence investment decisions across the critical minerals & energy security sector for years to come.

Background of the Strategic Partnership

The collaboration between Syrah Resources and Tesla forms a cornerstone of North America's drive toward battery supply chain independence. This partnership focuses on Syrah's Louisiana-based Vidalia facility, which holds the unique distinction of being the Western Hemisphere's only large-scale, vertically integrated graphite anode material production plant operating outside Chinese control.

Unlike Chinese facilities that benefit from extensive integrated supply ecosystems and lower operational costs, Syrah's facility offers strategic advantages including proximity to North American battery manufacturers, compliance with Western environmental and labour standards, and reduced shipping costs for regional customers. The facility represents a critical test case for establishing competitive graphite processing operations outside China's dominant market position.

The timeline of extensions reveals the complexity of meeting Tesla's stringent qualification requirements. The original September 16, 2025 deadline has undergone two extensions within a two-month period, demonstrating both companies' commitment to resolving technical challenges rather than terminating the strategically important relationship.

Milestone Original Date Current Extended Date Significance Initial Cure Deadline September 16, 2025 January 16, 2026 Final opportunity to address compliance issues First Extension Period N/A November 15, 2025 Initial extension attempt Final Qualification N/A February 9, 2026 Last chance for material certification Contract Volume 4-year period 8,000 metric tonnes Total graphite anode material commitment

The extension structure involves two distinct phases: a cure period ending January 16, 2026, during which Syrah must address alleged compliance deficiencies, and a final qualification phase with a hard deadline of February 9, 2026. Tesla retains contractual termination rights if final qualification is not achieved by the February deadline.

Why Did Tesla Issue a Default Notice Against Syrah?

Tesla's default notification in July 2025 stemmed from technical non-conformity issues rather than contractual breaches related to payment or timeline violations. The automaker determined that Syrah's Louisiana facility failed to deliver active anode material samples that met Tesla's rigorous battery specifications.

This technical hurdle extends beyond simple quality control challenges, highlighting the complex engineering requirements necessary for electric vehicle battery components. The qualification process demands that Syrah's Louisiana-produced graphite demonstrate:

• Consistent electrochemical performance metrics across production batches

• Thermal stability characteristics under battery operating conditions

• Particle size distribution specifications within Tesla's precise tolerances

• Material purity levels that ensure long-term battery reliability and safety

Notably, Syrah disputes being in default under the agreement while simultaneously working with Tesla to extend compliance deadlines. This approach suggests both companies recognise the mutual strategic value of maintaining the partnership despite current technical challenges.

Bollinger Innovations was delisted from the Nasdaq a month ago after failing to meet its market value requirements.","Electric truck manufacturer Bollinger Innovations Inc. is facing dozens of complaints over unpaid wages and a new stack of lawsuits by suppliers seeking millions of dollars in past due payments — and the state of Michigan is among those with money on the line.

The Oak Park-based startup, which promised in 2023 to invest $44 million and create 237 jobs in metro Detroit, is in default of its incentives agreement with the Michigan Economic Development Corp. The company was awarded $3 million by the state to help launch its Class 4 EV and has collected about a third of the cash.

Like many other EV startups that failed to launch, Bollinger’s business case has run into major hurdles, including falling demand for its pricey vehicles following the pullback of federal EV incentives.

As of Sept. 30, Bollinger had no qualified new jobs and 50 base employees, MEDC spokeswoman Danielle Emerson said. The company has laid off employees since then, Crain’s confirmed, though it is unclear how many.

Company representatives did not respond to requests for comment.

Bollinger has until May 4 to cure the default by reaching job milestones and “will be required to pay back all or a portion of those funds” if it fails to do so, Emerson said.

At the same time, the company is under investigation by the Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity, which has received 59 claims against the company about unpaid wages or benefits, department spokesperson Keely Lovern said.

“Those claims are still open and under investigation,” Lovern said. “Because they are open investigations, we cannot comment any further.”

Bollinger Motors was put into receivership in June when founder Robert Bollinger sued the company to recoup a loan and alleged the company was broke. David Michery, CEO and chairman of Brea, Calif.-based Mullen Automotive, which acquired a controlling stake in Bollinger in 2022, paid the founder back and promised to do the same for suppliers.

After emerging from receivership, Michery merged Bollinger Motors with Mullen to create Bollinger Innovations and consolidated operations to metro Detroit. He struck a resilient note during an interview in June, vowing that Bollinger Motors was here to stay.

A half-dozen suppliers sued Bollinger earlier this year, demanding payment of more than $5 million in outstanding bills, Crain’s reported in July. Those cases have since been disposed, but six different suppliers are now suing the company in active cases, according to Oakland County Circuit Court records.

Canadian supplier Promark Electronics Inc., German supplier Thyssenkrupp AG, Brazilian supplier Metalsa, Livonia-based Testron Corp., Troy-based Engineering Technology Associates Inc. and California-based Aibond Corp. are the plaintiffs in those cases.

Bollinger Innovations was delisted from the Nasdaq a month ago after failing to meet its market value requirements. Michery tried to remain in compliance by conducting nine reverse stock splits in three years, but its share value continually fell below the $1 minimum. The company is trading stock on the open markets at 13 cents per share as of Monday afternoon.

The company incurred a net loss of $304.4 million for the nine months ended June 30, according to the most recent financial statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in August. Its accumulated deficit at the time was $2.6 billion.

“The Company believes that its available liquidity will not be sufficient to meet its current obligations for a period of at least twelve months from the date of the filing of these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements,” the August filing said. “Accordingly, the Company has concluded there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.”",https://s3-rd-prod.crainsdetroit.com/styles/1200x630/s3/bollinger%20trucks.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 16:01:32.238515

GF has entered into a technology licensing agreement with TSMC for 650V and 80V GaN power technologies.
We combine differentiated GaN technology with a holistic approach to reliability, all the way from process development to device performance and application integration.
As we offer advanced GaN manufacturing with U.S.-based capacity to serve global programs, we’re strengthening our domestic manufacturing capabilities.
Why will GaN technology be qualified and produced in Burlington, Vermont?","On Nov 11, GlobalFoundries announced a new partnership with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) on gallium nitride technology to power the next generation of products for data center, industrial and automotive power applications. We sat down with Téa Williams, the Senior Vice President of the Power Business at GF, to discuss this technology agreement, why GF is doubling down on GaN and what customers can expect next.

What is the technology agreement between GF and TSMC, and why does it matter?

GF has entered into a technology licensing agreement with TSMC for 650V and 80V GaN power technologies. In practical terms, this enables us to accelerate development and commercialization of next‑generation GaN products for both industrial applications, like data centers, as well as consumer applications like automotive and smart mobile.

For us, this partnership is a strategic step that blends TSMC’s proven process IP with GF’s GaN offerings and manufacturing scale. Not only will this agreement drive the development of our next-generation GaN chips to address power needs for mission critical applications, but it will also provide U.S.-based GaN capacity for our global customer base.

Why is GaN so important right now?

Traditional silicon CMOS is hitting performance limits for high‑efficiency power conversion. GaN delivers higher efficiency, greater power density, and more compact systems. This is exactly what’s needed for hyperscale data centers, electric vehicles, renewable energy systems and fast charging electronics. GaN is empowering our customers to achieve more with less energy and less space.

What’s driving GF’s growing investment in GaN?

We’re doubling down on GaN for three key reasons. First, the market pull is undeniable. We’re seeing exploding demand for efficient power conversion — everywhere from electric vehicles to AI data centers to power grid modernization.

Second, GaN is simply the right technology for the job. Its performance hits the sweet spot for some of the toughest system requirements out there, including high voltage, high frequency, and thermal robustness.

Finally, we can bring something unique to the table. We combine differentiated GaN technology with a holistic approach to reliability, all the way from process development to device performance and application integration. That means we’re delivering solutions built to thrive in harsh environments and last for the long haul.

How will customers benefit from this agreement?

By giving customers access to proven GaN nodes, we’re accelerating both our own roadmap and our customers’ design cycles, so that they can get their products to the market faster.

As we offer advanced GaN manufacturing with U.S.-based capacity to serve global programs, we’re strengthening our domestic manufacturing capabilities. That means greater geographic diversity and stronger supply chain resilience for our customers.

Will customers in the U.S. be the only ones to benefit from this?

This will be beneficial to our customers from a global perspective. We are in discussion with many US and multinational customers that are eager to engage with us as we ready GaN for production.

Talking about ramping GaN, I want to also mention our Kolkata Power Center in India (ex-Tagore team), which has been a critical part of our GaN strategy. This center is closely aligned with GF’s facility in Burlington. I am excited to build on the complementary skillsets between these locations to further advance GF’s research, development and leadership in GaN chip manufacturing on a global scale.

Why will GaN technology be qualified and produced in Burlington, Vermont?

Burlington, Vermont is a center of innovation for GaN. Our site has deep expertise in high‑voltage GaN‑on‑Silicon and is equipped to scale volume production for customers who need next‑generation power devices with the highest standards of quality and reliability.

We’re excited to continue investing in these efforts, and have Burlington be the shining example of 200mm GaN Center of excellence.

How does this support U.S. semiconductor leadership, and is it driven by trade policy and tariffs?

This agreement is about accelerating time to market, and building a resilient, balanced manufacturing footprint here in the U.S. By qualifying advanced GaN technologies on U.S. soil, we’re strengthening the domestic supply of essential power semiconductors while serving global markets. Despite tariffs or trade policy continuing to evolve, this move is about supporting customers, boosting national competitiveness and growing the broader semiconductor ecosystem.

What’s coming up next for customers?

For any customers planning product launches in 2026–2027 for data centers, industrial or automotive segments, now’s the time to get involved. The Power team is collaborating closely with sales and manufacturing to plan an orderly ramp of top customers while building scale to serve the market as broadly as possible.

Any final thoughts, Téa?

There has never been a better time to be in Power Semiconductors! I am truly inspired about what we are building here at GF with GaN, BCD and integrated magnetics. Each of these process pillars by themselves can lead to outstanding opportunities, but when these strengths are put together, they unlock true differentiation in power product design.

We live in a world where energy consumption will only matter more every day: from smartphones to massive data centers. With our innovation and ingenuity in how to contribute to more sustainable and greener power solutions, GF is creating a better future now.

MESA, Ariz., Nov. 17, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Verra Mobility Corporation (NASDAQ: VRRM), a leading provider of smart mobility technology solutions, announced today the results of a new survey of 2,000 Americans who regularly use toll roads.

The survey examined Americans' perceptions of the various programs that fund roads and infrastructure.

The survey results can be downloaded by visiting www.verramobility.com/survey-ruc-road-usage-charging-toll-roads.

One of the main sources of funds to improve roads and bridges in the U.S. since 1932 has been the federal gas tax, which currently adds 18.4 cents per gallon for gasoline and 24.4 cents per gallon for diesel. Since the rise in electric vehicle (EV) sales, the gas tax revenue has been slowly declining. For example, in Pennsylvania, the Pennsylvania Petroleum Association reported an estimated drop in state gas tax revenue of $250 million when comparing 2024 to 2019.

The survey found:

Americans believe that roads are in need of improvements, with 93% of survey respondents stating that the infrastructure in their state needs to be improved.

When asked what they believed was the best way to recoup these funds, 73% of Americans answered that EV owners should have to pay an 'energy tax'.

""The U.S. is experiencing a fundamental shift in how we fund infrastructure improvements and expansions,"" said Stacey Moser, Executive Vice President and General Manager of Verra Mobility's Commercial Services business. ""Toll roads, and more recently, initiatives like New York City's congestion pricing program, have demonstrated that user-based funding models can be highly effective. These models generate reliable revenue but also offer drivers faster, safer and more reliable travel.""

One alternative is toll roads, which are currently utilized in many U.S. states. The U.S. tolling market was valued at approximately $12.5 billion in 2022 and is projected to reach $18.6 billion by 2030.

The study asked several questions on Americans' perceptions of toll roads, finding that:

67% of respondents said they believed toll roads were fairer than taxes

76% believed paying tolls is acceptable if the revenue is being used to improve the quality and safety of roads and bridges

72% believe everyone should pay the same for toll roads

75% believe that tolls should be the same regardless of time of day

65% said they would be more willing to pay tolls if they knew revenue was dedicated to infrastructure projects that directly benefited them

67% believe tolls should go away once a project is paid for

When asked directly if they were generally in favor of toll roads as a way to fund transportation projects, 51% were in favor, 30% were neutral and 20% were against. These numbers were slightly more favorable than when asked about other road use pricing models:

41% were in favor of road usage charging, with 33% being neutral and 25% against

41% were in favor of congestion pricing, with 31% being neutral and 28% against

""This evolution will have a significant impact on drivers and, even more so, on fleet operators, who must navigate a complex network of tolling authorities and payment schemes while staying compliant,"" continued Moser. ""As one of the largest payers of tolls in the country, Verra Mobility has a unique perspective on how these programs are rolled out and scaled. With many new funding models now emerging to address the decline in traditional gas tax revenues, we wanted to better understand how Americans view these changes, and this survey provides important insight into public sentiment.""

For more than 15 years, Verra Mobility has helped fleet owners and operators manage toll payments quickly and easily. Each year, the company processes over 300 million tolls and violations for more than seven million vehicles worldwide. By automatically paying tolls and preventing costly fines, Verra Mobility helps drivers stay on the move while saving businesses time and money. Its technology connects each toll to the right vehicle and driver, ensuring accurate, reliable billing and seamless travel across a growing network of toll roads.

Survey Methodology The data was derived from a survey by Verra Mobility conducted online via Pollfish on June 25, 2025. Two thousand Americans who reside in states that utilize toll roads were surveyed to ensure more awareness on alternative means of raising funds for road projects. The states included were California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Virginia, Washington and West Virginia.

The Just Transition Work Programme

The Just Transition Work Programme (JTWP) was established by the UN in 2022 as a response to long-standing calls to ensure that climate action is fair, inclusive, and equitable. Negotiators at COP30 have a chance to ensure the JTWP becomes a vehicle for real justice — one that does not simply describe a just transition but creates the systems and rules needed to deliver it.

The UNFCCC — the governing body of the international climate treaty — is the umbrella that allows countries to negotiate climate rules, commitments, and cooperation. These negotiations follow a mostly consensus-based model, meaning every Party must agree before a decision is adopted. This process is often slow, complex, and frustrating, but it is intended to ensure equity among countries with vastly different histories, responsibilities, and capacities.

The work on the Just Transition Work Programme is happening through an informal working group, or “contact group,” where negotiators review draft text line by line. Here, countries propose edits and attempt to find compromise text that all can accept. It is inside these rooms that the fate of the Just Transition Work Programme is being shaped, to determine whether it will remain a space for dialogue or evolve into a structure capable of delivering coordinated action, support, and resources that help foster a truly just transition.

For these discussions to have real impact, COP30 must move the JTWP from conversation to implementation. That means establishing a dedicated mechanism that ensures the principles agreed under the JTWP are carried forward, monitored, and enforced in future UNFCCC processes.

Earthworks is advocating for some key pieces to be included:

Indigenous Peoples’ Rights and Free, Prior, and Informed Consent

Indigenous Peoples must be at the forefront of solutions to the climate crisis. On Saturday, we saw Indigenous Peoples march through the streets of Belem carrying banners and signs reading “We are the answer.” The JTWP provides an opportunity to safeguard Indigenous Peoples’ rights.

Activities under the JTWP must fully respect Indigenous Peoples’ right to self-determination and the right to Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) as established in the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. FPIC means Indigenous Peoples have the right to say no, yes, or yes with conditions to projects on their lands and territories. The JTWP must include a mechanism to ensure those commitments are upheld.

The JTWP must also include mechanisms protecting the rights of Indigenous Peoples in Voluntary Isolation and Initial Contact, such as the precautionary principle and the principle of no contact. Mining and other energy transition activities threaten the lands, health, and cultures of Indigenous Peoples in Voluntary Insolation.

“Critical Minerals” Mining and Processing

The JTWP must include language that recognizes the impacts of so-called critical minerals. Minerals for batteries and other cleaner energy technologies are in demand. But mining and processing those minerals is causing harm to the environment and to frontline and Indigenous communities across the globe, from Brazil to Indonesia.

These risks were underscored in the principles and recommendations outlined in the report of the United Nations Secretary-General’s Panel on Critical Energy Transition Minerals, which recognized that social and environmental impacts of mining for minerals have to be addressed in order to have a truly just transition to a green economy. This includes the protection of human and labor rights, the assurance of FPIC, establishing ecological no-go zones; and a shift toward true circularity. The JTWP must establish mechanisms that ensure reliable, diversified, sustainable, transparent, and responsible supply chains.",https://earthworks.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/climatemarch1.jpeg,N,,2025-11-17 15:02:46.219824

Domestic capacity remains one of the most critical barriers in U.S. biomanufacturing.
By providing pilot-to-demonstration infrastructure within the U.S., BioMADE aims to reduce those risks and strengthen national supply chain security.
Wendy Wintersteen, President of Iowa State University, noted that the university’s technical expertise and existing research programs will help speed commercialization, shared, “Iowa State excels at biobased innovations.
A National Network to Strengthen Supply Chain Resilience The Iowa pilot plant is one of the first three sites in BioMADE’s emerging Pilot Plant Network, alongside projects in Minnesota and California.","BioMADE, the State of Iowa, Iowa State University (ISU), and the Iowa State University Research Park have broken ground on a pilot-scale bioindustrial manufacturing facility designed to close one of the most significant infrastructure gaps in the U.S. bioeconomy. The 15,000 sq. ft. facility—scheduled to open in 2027—will provide domestic scale-up capacity for companies developing biobased chemicals, fuels, materials, and consumer products. The investment aims to strengthen U.S. manufacturing competitiveness while creating new revenue opportunities for farmers across the Midwest.

Governor Kim Reynolds emphasized the strategic importance of the project, noting that the facility will support both commercial and defense-focused scale-up efforts.

“This facility provides innovators the space and equipment to test, scale, and bring new ideas to life—ideas that will give our military servicemembers the materials they need to keep us safe.""

The governor added that the site will help bring manufacturing back to the United States, particularly for bio-based fabrics, adhesives, plastics, and other materials that rely on Iowa-grown crops.

Accelerating Domestic Scale-Up and Reducing Overseas Dependence

The facility’s pilot-scale capabilities include 5,000- and 10,000-liter industrial fermenters, wet and dry lab space, and downstream processing equipment. These assets will support the development of a broad range of bioproducts—spanning agricultural feed inputs, industrial chemicals, plant-based ingredients, and sustainable materials. The site will also complement existing Iowa assets, such as the ISU Center for Crops Utilization Research.

Domestic capacity remains one of the most critical barriers in U.S. biomanufacturing. Many companies still rely on overseas facilities to scale production, increasing the risk of intellectual property loss and prolonging commercialization timelines. By providing pilot-to-demonstration infrastructure within the U.S., BioMADE aims to reduce those risks and strengthen national supply chain security.

Michael Holthe, performing the duties of Assistant Secretary of War for Science and Technology, underscored the national security implications, stating,

“The BioMADE Pilot Plant in Iowa is a prime example of their impact and will be vital for our nation’s long-term national and economic security.” .

Creating New Markets for American Agriculture

Iowa’s agricultural strengths make it uniquely positioned for this type of infrastructure. The state is a major producer of corn, soybeans, and sugar beets—feedstocks that can be converted into biobased fuels, lubricants, composites, thermal protection materials, foams, detergents, coatings, and a growing range of consumer products.

Wendy Wintersteen, President of Iowa State University, noted that the university’s technical expertise and existing research programs will help speed commercialization, shared,

“Iowa State excels at biobased innovations. Our cutting-edge expertise and infrastructure will help BioMADE advance the U.S. as a global leader in biomanufacturing.”

The expansion of bioprocessing capacity is expected to generate new revenue streams for farmers and rural communities. Similar initiatives in the Midwest have shown that integrating crop production directly into biomanufacturing supply chains enhances local economic resilience and reduces dependency on volatile export markets.

A National Network to Strengthen Supply Chain Resilience

The Iowa pilot plant is one of the first three sites in BioMADE’s emerging Pilot Plant Network, alongside projects in Minnesota and California. The network is intended to create a distributed, scalable set of industrial fermentation and processing hubs that can support U.S.-based production from early development through commercial demonstration.

BioMADE has committed at least $20 million to the Iowa project, with ISU contributing up to $10 million and the Iowa Economic Development Authority (IEDA) providing an additional $10 million through its Strategic Infrastructure Program. IEDA Director Debi Durham described the facility as the “missing piece” of Iowa’s biomanufacturing ecosystem, enabling the critical bridge between research and industrial-scale production.

Douglas Friedman, BioMADE CEO, stated that the project represents a foundational investment in U.S. competitiveness. “This Pilot Plant joins a network of forthcoming facilities that will establish the U.S. as a leader in the global bioeconomy,” he said.

Positioning the U.S. for the Twenty-First Century Bioeconomy

The expansion of U.S. biomanufacturing infrastructure aligns with broader national objectives around supply-chain resilience, reshoring, and low-carbon industrial development. Studies from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the National Academies have repeatedly highlighted the economic potential of bioindustrial production, especially in industries such as sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs), performance materials, and biobased polymers.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20251117-092053-a0b-Combine%20Harvester%20in%20an%20Agricultural%20Field.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 15:02:26.073224

The government funds would take care of their installation costs, and once installed, lower the burden of rising electricity costs, a pressing concern.

Then, Praileau heard the federal government had scrapped the $7bn Solar For All programme through which his project and other solar projects across the country were to be funded, leaving them stranded.

It is one of several federally funded renewable energy projects that have been scrapped or will end early, veering off the country’s planned shift to renewable energy, also making it harder to meet climate goals.

Praileau, Virginia programme director for Solar United Neighbors, had been helping roll out the project that received $156m in federal funds to support 7,500 low- and middle-income families with solar installation. Praileau say he was “mind blown” by the sudden withdrawal.

The federal government will also end the 30 percent tax credit for solar rooftop installation in homes this December. For businesses, these tax credits will only be available if they start construction of factories, malls or other businesses, for which the solar installations are meant, by June 2026.

The Department of Energy also withdrew $13bn in funding from a range of other renewable energy projects, including upgrading power grids, carbon-neutral cement production, and battery energy storage. The administration also ended several funding initiatives for wind energy.

President Trump has said, “We’re not going to be approving windmills unless something happens that’s an emergency.”

This could lead to a $114bn loss in delays or cancellation of wind energy projects, according to an April 2025 report by BloombergNEF.

In Florida, intake forms for 10,000 low- and middle-income households to enrol for federal subsidies to get solar units installed on their rooftops were ready when the $156m project was scrapped in August.

A resident of Miami-Dade County had told volunteers who were helping her fill in the forms to enrol for the grant that she was “scared to use power. I am scared to put on air conditioning”, because the steep rise in power costs in the state had put it out of reach for her.

Power costs in the state are up 60 percent for some residents since 2019, Heaven Campbell, Florida programme director of Solar United Neighbors, which was working on implementing the project, told Al Jazeera.

Other states have also seen varying power cost hikes due to hurricanes and the war in Ukraine, which made Russian natural gas more expensive.

Florida Power and Light, the utilities provider, has also currently made a case to increase rates further to raise nearly $10bn over the next four years, according to Florida’s Office of Public Counsel.

Solar United’s staff has tried to educate residents that not using power could get them disconnected, and reconnecting comes with a fee.

Early ending of the tax credit will mean “consumers are stuck at the mercy of utilities”, and their rising rates, says Bernadette Del Chiaro, senior vice president for California at the Environmental Working Group.

‘Rain shadow impact’

With the solar rooftop tax credits set to expire in December, there has been a scramble to install, and some solar installers say they are having to turn away customers.

“We will see the rain shadow impact of this in 2026,” Del Chiaro says, referring to a sharp drop in business and jobs that the industry is steeling itself for next year.

“This is a big plunge on the solar coaster,” says Barry Cinnamon, chief executive of Cinnamon Energy Systems, a San Francisco-based solar installation company.

Ed Murray, president of the California Solar and Storage Association, told Al Jazeera he expects the elimination of tax credits to double the payback time for installation and other costs associated with the solar units to up to 12 years.

It would also lead to job losses for thousands of skilled workers in the sector, Murray said, even as the air quality is likely to worsen and the state is expected to fail to meet its climate goals.

In its announcement withdrawing from these projects, the Department of Energy notification said the projects “advance the previous Administration’s wasteful Green New Scam agenda”.

In the statement, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said that, “By returning these funds to the American taxpayer, the Trump administration is affirming its commitment to advancing more affordable, reliable and secure American energy and being more responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars.”

Critics of solar projects have said they drive up costs for households still on the power grid because solar customers pay less to utilities but still use that power when needed.

The Trump administration has, instead, supported oil and gas production through several measures, including plans to open up the entire Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) for oil and gas leasing recently. It has also eased permitting for drilling on federal lands.

Rising costs

The Biden administration had funded renewable energy projects under what it called the Green New Deal, a programme to accelerate economic growth and job creation while having a positive climate impact.

But even as these projects began rolling out, power costs have risen sharply in many states, including Virginia.

A recent study by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found that the rise in power costs had outpaced inflation in 26 states and listed a range of factors for it, including the Ukraine war and extreme weather factors such as wildfires and hurricanes that have damaged an already ageing electric poles and grid.

For instance, prices in California have risen more than 34 percent since 2019, the study says, in part because the record-breaking wildfires forced utilities to replace and strengthen their power lines. Federal funding of $630m to strengthen grids in California was among the projects scrapped by the Department of Energy.

“A majority of the projects that were scrapped were mid-implementation,” says Ryan Schleeter, communications director of The Climate Center, a California-based think tank.

Federal incentives also meant that more than 20 percent of the cars sold in the state over the last two years had been electric vehicles (EVs). These allowed middle-income families to buy EVs, Schleeter says. With incentives having ended on September 30, “the central challenge will be how to be equitable,” he says.

Susan Stephenson, executive director of California Power and Light, which supports places of worship to have renewable energy, says several places of worship that had planned to move to solar energy or install EV charging stations are now struggling to find installers and have seen costs going up beyond their initial budget due to federal cuts.

In Virginia, Praileau says power costs came up as one of the greatest concerns in his interactions with his congregants. The state has among the most data centres in the country, and Praileau believes that could be a reason for rising costs.

Voter dissatisfaction over rising power costs has been among the top issues in the governor’s elections in the state that went to the polls on November 4. One of the promises that Abigail Spanberger, the Democrat candidate who won, had made was to reduce power costs by increasing energy production and getting data centres to pay a higher share of power costs.

Praileau hopes the solar project, the cuts to which are already being litigated, can also be revived by the new governor. In Florida, too, there is ongoing litigation on the federal funding cuts.

Several states, including California, have announced their own rollbacks on renewable energy incentives.

But with funding withdrawals hurting residents, Steve Larson, a former executive director of the California Public Utilities Commission, expects more litigation to restore programmes and mastering “techniques of delay”, for federal cuts in grants and to allow renewable energy projects to keep going.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP23224651571332-1763402452.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-11-17 17:01:45.516166

Case in point: progressive darling Graham Platner is running strong against Janet Mills for the Maine Senate Democratic nomination.
The starkness of this challenge is underscored by the difficulties of being truly moderate in today’s Democratic Party.
Abigail Spanberger is a moderate within the current Democratic Party, but she is not a moderate from the perspective of 1998.
Most want strong public schools and the flexibility to choose which school their children attend… [Trump’s] extremism offers an opportunity to the Democratic Party.","The Democrats have a new mantra: “affordability.” It played a starring role in Democratic gubernatorial victories in New Jersey and Virginia and in the surprising mayoral victory of democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani in New York City. By all accounts, this was an effective message even controlling for other factors like the light blue to deep blue nature of these states and municipalities, the overrepresentation of Democratic-friendly educated, engaged voters in these elections, and the general unpopularity of President Trump.

Affordability is an area of deep vulnerability for Trump and his party since they promised to fix Biden and the Democrats’ mismanagement of the economy and are not viewed as having done so. According to Silver Bulletin’s polling aggregates, Trump’s handling of the economy is 18 points underwater (approval minus disapproval) and an astonishing 28 points underwater on handling inflation (34 percent approval vs. 62 percent disapproval). Other data show that general views of the economy have not improved since Trump took office, that most believe Trump’s policies are actually making the economy worse and that more see the economy getting worse rather than better in the coming year.

In such a situation, it would be political malpractice not to focus on this vulnerability, neatly encapsulated in the term “affordability.” Everything just costs too damn much! Democrats have taken to this approach delightedly, whether moderate or fire-breathing progressive. It provides a convenient way of changing the subject when other issues, particularly cultural ones, come up where their views are decidedly less popular. Pay no attention to those other issues: we Democrats are affordability people!

Will this work? Well, it did in 2025. Indeed, it worked so well that one Democratic commentator declared it a new “theory of everything” for the Democrats and there has been general euphoria that—finally!—a way has been found to neutralize the toxic image the party has developed over time. In short, Democrats hope to affordability-wash their party brand and be reborn as a party that cares for little beyond making ordinary citizens’ lives easier and better. But can the Democrats really wash away their political sins so easily?

There are reasons to be skeptical that affordability, despite its utility as a campaign trope, has such magical powers. Start with the ongoing struggle between moderates and progressives within the party. Their differences were temporarily suppressed during the 2025 campaigns, where everyone latched onto the affordability message, but in the aftermath these differences are coming to the fore. Mamdani’s victory in New York City has put wind in the sails of the good ship Progressive; now is not the time they say to bow “at the altar of caution.” Such candidates are running hard to the left in many Democratic primaries and Democrats could well find themselves with their own version of Republicans’ Tea Party problem from the early 2010’s where insurgents undermined GOP electoral fortunes.

Case in point: progressive darling Graham Platner is running strong against Janet Mills for the Maine Senate Democratic nomination. In past social media posts, Platner referred to himself as a communist, disparaged the police, and criticized Maine’s rural white people for being “stupid” and “racist.” And then there’s his “Totenkopf” tattoo historically associated with the Nazis. Not ideal; recent polling indicates that with this baggage Republican Susan Collins would easily vanquish him in a general election.

After balanced information about Platner, he trails Collins significantly. After a positive paragraph reflective of Platner’s bio and current campaign messaging, and a negative paragraph summarizing the recent news about him and reflecting likely Republican messaging in a general election, Collins gets above 50 percent and Platner trails her by 9 (42 percent Platner / 51 percent Collins)—the same margin by which Democrats lost the 2020 Maine Senate race.

Without flipping Collins’ seat, Democrats’ chances of taking back the Senate are extremely small. In general, Democrats are in desperate need of moderate candidates who can overcome, rather than reinforce, the negative weight of the party’s image—an image which cannot be magically affordability-washed away in purple-to-red states. This imperative is underscored by this chart from Lakshya Jain on how Democrats would do in Senate contests outside of Maine and North Carolina even if 2026 is a 2018-type blue wave (D+7.3) election.

The starkness of this challenge is underscored by the difficulties of being truly moderate in today’s Democratic Party. As liberal Ezra Klein admitted, apropos of the 2025 results:

If Democrats want power in the Senate in any significant numbers ever again, they’re going to need to be competitive in places where they used to be able to win elections. Places like Ohio, Florida, Iowa, Nebraska, South Dakota, North Dakota and Alaska. But they’ve not really been competitive there for some time.

So I don’t know how much I think this was a positive test of that…Abigail Spanberger is a moderate in Virginia and Zohran Mamdani is a democratic socialist in New York City…But also by any historical measure of politics, they’re actually just not that far apart. Abigail Spanberger is a moderate within the current Democratic Party, but she is not a moderate from the perspective of 1998.

The thing about all three of these figures is that none of them challenge Democrats in any significant way, except maybe Mamdani, from the left…I don’t think the question of what you would need to do to win an election in Ohio, Florida and Iowa is answered yet.

Indeed not. The fact of the matter is that Democrats can’t just sprinkle affordability pixie dust over their candidates—they actually need to move their left-trending party to the right in important ways. As noted in the big New York Times feature on “Moving to the Center Is the Way to Win”:

The success of candidates like [Democrat Marcy Kaptur, who successfully defended her House seat in a district that Trump won easily] demonstrates that America still has a political center. Polls show that most voters prefer capitalism to socialism and worry that the government is too big—and also think that corporations and the wealthy have too much power. Most voters oppose both the cruel immigration enforcement of the Trump administration and the lax Biden policies that led to a record immigration surge. Most favor robust policing to combat crime and recoil at police brutality. Most favor widespread abortion access and some restrictions late in pregnancy. Most oppose race-based affirmative action and support class-based affirmative action. Most support job protections for trans people and believe that trans girls should not play girls’ sports. Most want strong public schools and the flexibility to choose which school their children attend…

[Trump’s] extremism offers an opportunity to the Democratic Party. Mr. Trump is governing in ways that put the Republican Party out of step with public opinion on taxes, health insurance, abortion, immigration, executive power and more. If Democrats were willing to be less ideological—less beholden to views that many liberal activists, intellectuals and donors genuinely hold but that most Americans do not—they would have the opportunity to build the country’s next governing majority.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LXFF!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F68ae75d0-c329-46b6-824c-c820640fedd1_1100x220.jpeg",N,,2025-11-17 14:04:14.812366

Big bets on building, acquiring gas

NRG Energy expects to announce a data center agreement in 2026 associated with new natural gas development in its partnership with GE Vernova and Kiewit, the company’s CEO, Lawrence Coben, said in a Nov. 6 earnings call.

The first step of that joint venture is to start work on four gas projects totaling around 5.4 GW for the ERCOT and PJM markets. During the call, Coben said a data center agreement is set to be announced sometime next year, but he declined to pin down an exact month or quarter for the announcement.

“As far as [GE Vernova] goes, in this Kiewit partnership, did you have a certain time frame that you need to move some of this equipment — use it or lose it, if you will?” asked Jefferies analyst Julien Dumoulin-Smith.

Coben said the company hasn’t disclosed a time frame yet, but added, “I’m very confident that we’re going to meet all of the timelines that are required under that agreement.”

NRG, GE Vernova and Kiewit plan to have 1.2 GW of combined-cycle gas turbines in service by 2029, another 1.2 GW in service by 2030, and an additional 3 GW brought online from 2030 to 2032. Development activities are in progress across all sites, the company said.

NRG is also anticipating the closure of its deal to acquire 19 GW of assets from LS Power in the first quarter next year for roughly $12 billion. The assets include a demand-response company and around 12.9 GW of gas-fired power plant capacity. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved the plan on Friday.

On the call, NRG also provided updates on resources it is developing in Texas. In September, NRG “entered into a $562 million loan agreement with the Public Utility Commission of Texas ... for a low-interest rate loan at 3%” to support development of the 689-MW Cedar Bayou generation facility, the company said.

In response to an analyst question about NRG’s priorities within PJM, as opposed to ERCOT, Coben said the company “will really accelerate those efforts, of course, once [the LS acquisition] closes. Because once we own the generation assets there, that will really vault us into being a significant player. But there is no grass growing under our feet there in the meantime.”

Across PJM and ERCOT, NRG has expanded its data center customer portfolio with “150 MW of new premium long-term power agreements, bringing total contracted capacity to 445 MW,” Coben said.

Coben noted that total electricity consumption in Texas has increased “nearly 30% over the past five years, driven by residential, commercial and industrial demand, as electrification and onshoring of manufacturing accelerate. Data center development usage remains early, with ramp schedules expected to add meaningful capacity over the next several years.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/vS3lpRxxYrc3eJ8ZesMJg4ICC_DxYstg5ZJ_9wghHFI/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9OUkdfSm9saWV0X1Bvd2VyX1N0YXRpb24uanBn.webp,N,,2025-11-17 15:02:34.328515

WASHINGTON, Nov. 17, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The Hamm Institute for American Energy's American Energy + AI Initiative, along with the National Center of Energy Analytics and the CGCN Group's American Energy + AI Coalition, today announced the outcomes of the American Energy + AI DC Summit.

The working session brought together U.S. cabinet officials, senior industry executives, investors and policy experts to examine how the United States can add enough firm power, on near-term timelines, to meet rapidly rising AI-driven demand. The event was held at GE Vernova's Washington, D.C. office.

U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and U.S. Deputy Secretary of the Interior Kate MacGregor provided a briefing on current efforts and remaining gaps.

They participated in the discussion as part of the administration's focus on modernizing federal tools at the Department of Energy and Department of the Interior to support increased power production, transmission buildout, and smarter use of federal lands and emergency authorities.

Through its American Energy + AI Initiative, the Hamm Institute has spent the past year commissioning new research on how to power AI with firm energy, translating that work into policy-ready insights, and hosting working sessions from Oklahoma City to Palo Alto to bring industry, policymakers and investors into alignment around near-term solutions.

""America's ability to lead in AI will depend on whether we can build enough firm power, fast. The Hamm Institute's American Energy + AI Initiative exists to turn convenings like the Summit into steel in the ground, projects underway, and a clear research-backed roadmap that industry and policymakers can use,"" said Ann Bluntzer Pullin, PhD, executive director of the Hamm Institute for American Energy.

As the non-political partner, the Hamm Institute is leading the convening. In contrast, the American Energy + AI Coalition, led by CGCN, is focused on the policy, legislative and regulatory roadmap required to translate those findings.

""This was yet another productive session by the leaders of the Hamm Institute. Through extensive outreach and dialogue, they are developing concrete, meaningful policy reforms to help advance the power and AI goals shared by the electricity and technology sectors, as well as the Trump administration,"" said Mike Catanzaro, CEO of CGCN Group and executive director of the American Energy + AI Coalition. ""Many thanks to Secretary Wright and Deputy Secretary MacGregor for their participation today and their effective leadership on this critically important issue for the nation.""

The Hamm Institute for American Energy commissioned a new study from Mark P. Mills, executive director of the National Center for Energy Analytics and distinguished fellow at the Hamm Institute, titled The Rise of AI: A Reality Check on Energy and Economic Impacts. The report analyzes how surging AI deployment is reshaping U.S. electricity demand and the broader economy and outlines the scale of new firm power required for America to stay competitive. Mills, who testified on AI and data centers before the House Subcommittee on Economic Growth, Energy Policy, and Regulatory Affairs in April 2025, shared key implications for policymakers during the Summit.

""Forecasters, pundits, and policymakers have all been surprised, even shocked, by the magnitude and speed of electricity demand emerging to power AI and the hundreds of billions of dollars of data centers under construction and planned,"" said Mills. ""The economic and strategic importance of the AI race sidelines the idea of an energy transition and highlights the old 'all-of-the-above' approach, especially the immediate needs for more natural gas.""

The Rise of AI is the first paper in a series of reports and forecasts to be produced between the two organizations.

GE Vernova hosted the Summit as part of its work to support customers across power generation, grid, and nuclear as they respond to surging demand from AI, data centers, and advanced manufacturing.

""AI has tremendous opportunity to drive economic growth, and it all starts with energy,"" said GE Vernova CEO Scott Strazik. ""Behind every data center is critical demand for reliable and affordable power. The countries that build resilient, modern energy systems will define the next wave of global competitiveness. We are excited about the opportunity to help our customers and appreciate the Hamm Institute leading this work with research and convenings along with the partnership of Secretaries Burgum and Wright as the Administration works to develop smart energy and innovation policies to shape the future.""

Nov. 17, 2025 – New research indicates that more than 70% of energy sector respondents believe that digital technologies, particularly artificial intelligence (AI) and grid software, are essential to enabling the clean energy transition. Such technology supports the integration of renewables, transition to electrification and optimization of energy efficiency, all of which are key to reducing fossil fuel usage.

The Siemens Infrastructure Transition Monitor 2025, which surveyed 1,400 senior executives, shows that 59% of energy industry leaders plan major investments in autonomous systems for grids, and 68% view them as crucial for cutting emissions. Nearly three-quarters (72%) of organizations in the sector say that, over the next three years, AI will transform how their business operates, with 74% saying that AI is helping to make critical infrastructure more resilient.

Respondents indicated that the most likely outcomes from increased use of autonomous systems to manage power grids are lower operating costs, increased energy efficiency and greater reliability.

While the 2025 study indicated significant progress on a number of important goals such as the phase-out of fossil fuel energy and the expansion of large-scale energy storage and renewable generation compared to results in the 2023 Infrastructure Transition Monitor, there are still opportunities for even greater progress.

Indeed, more than half of companies in the energy sector (58%) say uncertainty about future energy system design is delaying investment in clean energy technologies. And, while 65%agree that electrification is the most feasible way to achieve net zero energy systems, 73% report that it is being held back by inadequate grid infrastructure.

Sabine Erlinghagen, CEO of Siemens Grid Software, said: “Outdated grid infrastructure poses a serious threat to the clean energy transition. By harnessing digital technologies to move towards autonomous grids, it is possible to boost grid capacity, ensuring its reliability and resilience.

Most of the charging stations are located at gas stations like Kwik Trip.

Wisconsin will soon install 26 new electric vehicle charging stations using an influx of $14 million in federal money that the Trump administration attempted to block.

In May, Wisconsin joined 15 states in suing the U.S. Department of Transportation and Secretary Sean Duffy — a former Wisconsin congressman — over the administration's freeze of electric vehicle infrastructure funds.

In June, a federal judge ordered the administration to release funding for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program, which included more than $62 million for Wisconsin.

“Thanks to our actions to get the Trump administration to release this critical funding that they were illegally withholding, we are thrilled to see the NEVI program continue to support these goals and further move us toward the clean energy future Wisconsinites deserve,"" Democratic Gov. Tony Evers said in a Nov. 17 news release.

The new charging stations span the state, from Port Washington to Arbor Vitae to Eau Claire. Many are located at Kwik Trips, other gas stations and hotels.

In total, 78 charging stations have been installed using $36 million from the program. The vast majority are located at gas stations.

Members of both parties pushed through legislation last year that paved the way for Wisconsin to participate in the federal program, created under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law during the Biden administration.

Federal funds can cover up to 80% of the costs of building out each charging station. Companies applying for the grants, such as Kwik Trip, Tesla and Universal EV, cover a minimum of 20%.

The survey found that 58% of residents of such communities are hopeful about the future of their community, down from 78% last year.","Des Moines, Iowa — Pessimism about the country's future has risen in cities since last year, but rural America is more optimistic about what's ahead for the U.S., according to a new survey from the American Communities Project.

And despite President Donald Trump’s insistence that crime is out of control in big cities, residents of the nation’s largest metropolitan centers are less likely to list crime and gun violence among the chief concerns facing their communities than they were a couple years ago.

Optimism about the future is also down from last year in areas with large Hispanic communities.

These are some of the snapshots from the new ACP/Ipsos survey, which offers a nuanced look at local concerns by breaking the nation’s counties into community types, using data points like race, income, age and religious affiliation. The survey evaluated moods and priorities across the 15 different community types, such as heavily Hispanic areas, big cities and different kinds of rural communities.

The common denominator across the communities? A gnawing worry about daily household costs.

“Concerns about inflation are across the board,” said Dante Chinni, founder and director of ACP. “One thing that truly unites the country is economic angst.”

Rising optimism in rural areas, despite economic anxiety

Rural residents are feeling more upbeat about the country's trajectory — even though most aren't seeing Trump's promised economic revival.

The $15 price tag on a variety pack of Halloween candy at the Kroger supermarket last month struck Carl Gruber. Disabled and receiving federal food aid, the 42-year-old from Newark, Ohio, had hardly been oblivious to lingering, high supermarket prices.

But Gruber, whose wife also is unable to work, is hopeful about the nation's future, primarily in the belief that prices will moderate as Trump suggests.

“Right now, the president is trying to get companies who moved their businesses out of the country to move them back,” said Gruber, a Trump voter whose support has wavered over the federal shutdown that delayed his monthly food benefit. “So, maybe we'll start to see prices come down.”

About 6 in 10 residents of Rural Middle America — Newark's classification in the survey — say they are hopeful about the country's future over the next few years, up from 43% in the 2024 ACP survey. Other communities, like heavily evangelical areas or working-class rural regions, have also seen an uptick in optimism.

Kimmie Pace, a 33-year-old unemployed mother of four from a small town in northwest Georgia, said, “I have anxiety every time I go to the grocery store.”

But she, too, is hopeful in Trump. “Trump’s in charge, and I trust him, even if we’re not seeing the benefits yet,” she said.

Big-city residents are worried about the future

By contrast, the share of big-city residents who say they are hopeful about the nation's future has shrunk, from 55% last year to 45% in the new survey.

Robert Engel of San Antonio — Texas' booming, second most-populous city — is worried about what's next for the U.S., though less for his generation than the next. The 61-year-old federal worker, whose employment was not interrupted by the government shutdown nor Trump's effort to reduce the federal workforce, is near retirement and feels financially stable.

A stable job market, health care availability and a fair economic environment for his adult children are his main priorities.

Recently, the inflation outlook has worsened under Trump. Consumer prices in September increased at an annual rate of 3%, up from 2.3% in April, when the president first began to roll out substantial tariff increases that burdened the economy with uncertainty.

Engel's less-hopeful outlook for the country is broader. “It's not just the economy, but the state of democracy and polarization,” Engel said. “It's a real worry. I try to be cautiously optimistic, but it's very, very hard.”

Crime, gun violence are less a concern in urban America

Trump had threatened to deploy the National Guard to Chicago, New York, Seattle, Baltimore, San Francisco and Portland, Oregon, to fight what he said was runaway, urban crime.

Yet data shows most violent crime in those places, and around the country, has declined in recent years. That tracks with the poll, which found that residents of America's Big Cities and Middle Suburbs are less likely to list crime or gun violence among the top issues facing their communities than they were in 2023.

For Angel Gamboa, a retired municipal worker in Austin, Texas, Trump's claims don't ring true in the city of roughly 1 million people.

“I don't want to say it's overblown, because crime is a serious subject,"" Gamboa said. “But I feel like there's an agenda to scare Americans, and it's so unnecessary.”

Instead, residents of Big Cities are more likely to say immigration and health care are important issues for their communities.

Big Cities are one of the community types where residents are most likely to say they’ve seen changes in immigration recently, with 65% saying they’ve seen a change in their community related to immigration over the past 12 months, compared with only about 4 in 10 residents of communities labeled in the survey as Evangelical Hubs or Rural Middle America.

Gamboa says he has witnessed changes, notably outside an Austin Home Depot, where day laborers regularly would gather in the mornings to find work.

Not anymore, he said.

“Immigrants were not showing up there to commit crimes,"" Gamboa said. ""They were showing up to help their families. But when ICE was in the parking lot, that's all it took to scatter people who were just trying to find a job.”

Hispanic communities are less hopeful about the future

After Hispanic voters moved sharply toward Trump in the 2024 election, the poll shows that residents of heavily Hispanic areas are feeling worse about the future of their communities than they were before Trump was elected.

Carmen Maldonado describes her community of Kissimmee, Florida, a fast-growing, majority-Hispanic city of about 80,000 residents about 22 miles (35 kilometers) south of Orlando, as “seriously troubled.”

The 61-year-old retired, active-duty National Guard member isn't alone. The survey found that 58% of residents of such communities are hopeful about the future of their community, down from 78% last year.

“It's not just hopelessness, but fear,” said Maldonado, who says people in her community — even her fellow native Puerto Ricans, who are American citizens — are anxious about the Trump administration's aggressive pursuit of Latino immigrants.

Just over a year ago, Trump made substantial inroads with Hispanic voters in the 2024 presidential election.

Beyond just the future of their communities, Hispanic respondents are also substantially less likely to say they’re hopeful about the future of their children or the next generation: 55% this year, down from 69% in July 2024.

Maldonado worries that the Trump administration's policies have stoked anti-Hispanic attitudes and that they will last for her adult child's lifetime and beyond.

“My hopelessness comes from the fact that we are a large part of what makes up the United States,” she said, “and sometimes I cry thinking about these families.”

Parwani and Thomson-DeVeaux reported from Washington.

While the U.S. civilian nuclear industry today employs about 70,000 people, that workforce will need to at least triple within the next decade to meet the goal of ten new reactors by 2030.

In 2023, however, the International Atomic Energy Agency announced a coordinated research project to explore ways artificial intelligence (AI) might expedite the deployment of small modular reactors. The IAEA said that sophisticated AI computer systems, which mimic human logic in problem solving and decision making, can enhance efficiency, automation, safety, and predictive maintenance – all while optimizing processes.

Kevin Kong, founder and CEO of Everstar, says the reason that the U.S. nuclear workforce is aging is that its nuclear powerplants themselves are aging – for two reasons. Nuclear energy, Kong says, has perhaps the worst public relations in the history of commerce. It gets condemned for one or two bad days, while catastrophes with lesser fuels hardly slowed their development.

That’s bad enough, he says, but an even bigger obstacle to a vigorous nuclear energy industry has for the past five decades been the regulatory Gordian Knot that has driven permitting and construction times – and costs – through the roof.

It only took 22 months in the 1950s for American technology to permit and construct the nation’s first commercial nuclear reactor in Pennsylvania. The recently commissioned Vogtle units 3 and 4 in Georgia took an average of 15 years apiece through the regulatory labyrinth.

Vogtle’s delays, however, pale in comparison with the nightmares experienced by the operators of the Watts Bar 1 and 2 reactors in Tennessee. Construction on unit 1 began in 1973, but the reactor did not begin commercial operation until 1996. Construction of Unit 2, which finally went online in 2016, began all the way back in 1972. That’s 44 years – no wonder there were massive cost overruns.

Tech giants like Google are counting on Everstar’s “knot-cutting” solutions to move nuclear power from being stuck in quicksand to the forefront. They need clean and guaranteed 24/7/365 energy, and nuclear is “clean, firm, carbon-free, and can be sited just about anywhere,” says Google’s Michael Terrell.

America today has an estimated 3,000 data centers, with thousands more being built or planned for operations by 2030, plus thousands more worldwide. This growth rate could increase global data center power demand by as much as 165% within the next five years. A Goldman Sachs estimate suggests energy demand for data centers could reach 400 terawatt-hours by 2030 – four times that in 2020.

Nuclear is perhaps the only technology that can meet that exponential demand growth – but only if permitting and construction periods can be slashed, a skilled workforce can be recruited and trained, and sufficient nuclear fuel can be acquired and processed. A recent MIT study found that the U.S. needs to get 45 to 50 new reactors up and running quickly just to meet growing electricity demand from data centers..

Kong says his obsession with energy abundance stems from his recognition that every leap in human development followed an increase in energy density. Humanity went from wood to coal and it tripled, sparking the Industrial Revolution; oil’s energy density, twice that of coal, powers an electrified society that has brought prosperity to billions.

Nuclear energy, Kong says, has an energy density 1.5 million times that of natural gas.

Other nations recognize this – but the U.S. remains bogged down in bureaucracy and a lack of a sense of urgency brought about by decades of being told nuclear means death. This even though wood, coal, and oil have killed many more humans than nuclear power plants and that all three pollute the atmosphere to one degree or another. Cheaper nuclear can extend prosperity – if it ever gets the chance.

China is on a push to build 100 nuclear power plants in the next two decades, using U.S.-based reactor designs – at 20% of the cost for the same unit in the United States. Six to eight new plants are coming online each year. The shortage of qualified nuclear personnel in the U.S. is reflected in the fact that South Korean firms are providing the technical expertise for U.S. plants.

Kong, however, is not just pointing fingers. Everstar is already a world leader in designing AI for the nuclear energy industry. Everstar’s Gordian, its flagship AI platform, is revolutionizing nuclear licensing and regulatory compliance by cutting through the regulatory “Gordian Knot” that has grown exponentially since the Three Mile Island mini-meltdown.

Last November, Everstar and NANO Nuclear Energy Inc. announced the success of a three-month pilot project using Everstar’s AI solutions across a broad range of NANO’s regulatory and licensing workflows. The collaboration produced an advanced AI-driven compliance solution that simplified and streamlined NANO’s regulatory processes.

Everstar capitalized on that success after receiving $4 million in pre-seed funding in February to build out its Gordian Research, which launched on September 1. Built by a world-class team of nuclear and AI experts from Google, Microsoft, SpaceX, Tesla, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the CIA, Gordian organizes complex nuclear information and slashes document-heavy workflows by 80% or more.

The typical nuclear powerplant amasses 2 million labor hours and 2 million pages of paperwork just to get its reactor design approved – and a total of 500 million labor hours over the life of the reactor. That, says Kong, means that up to 90% of the cost of a new nuclear reactor is the result of paperwork. For example, the regulatory specs for a simple valve make the nuclear buyer pay 90 times the cost of the same valve to an oil and gas company.

While China is building 150 new nuclear plants, and other nations are start-to-finish in just a few years, the United States half a century ago – and even today – replaced a building culture at the old Atomic Energy Commission with a permission (denied) culture at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Without the regulatory Gordian Knot, nuclear might already be the cheapest of all.

Because Everstar’s Gordian platform has demonstrated its ability to dramatically accelerate the regulatory process without compromising safety standards, it is already in use in the operating reactor, new reactor, and radioactive materials industries and allowing engineers to do engineering work rather than endless paperwork.

Everstar’s Gordian platform is fundamentally changing how nuclear teams operate, says Kong. “This is why I built Everstar – to help unleash nuclear power as an abundant energy source.”

America, believes, cannot afford to miss the next quantum leap toward energy abundance, and nuclear, he insists, is the Standard Oil of the 21st century. Imagine where we would be today had we invested the $1.5 trillion we spent on far less efficient wind, solar, and other “green” energy on the one “green” energy that has the potential to turn the lights on worldwide.

With this growth comes significant capital investment and energy consumption.

Fortunately, U.S. tax policy offers key incentives data center operators can leverage to reduce costs and enhance cash flow while improving their energy consumption strategy.

Renewable energy credits for data centers

The investment tax credit

An increasing number of data centers are looking to renewable energy technologies such as solar and battery storage to supplement traditional grid-based sources. These systems not only support the growing energy demands of data centers — they also provide substantial tax savings through federal credits.

For decades, the investment tax credit (ITC) has served as a powerful tax incentive for organizations installing various types of renewable energy systems. The list of eligible technologies and the amount of the ITC were greatly expanded with the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), with many systems qualifying for a minimum credit of 30% of their cost. Investments eligible for the ITC include solar, battery storage, fuel cells, and geothermal HVAC — all of which can reduce grid reliance, costs, and carbon output — providing an all-around win for data center operators.

What’s more, data centers that can’t use their federal energy credits due to net operating losses can sell them for cash under the IRA’s transferability option, which has created a robust market for credit buyers and sellers.

Solar

Whether ground- or roof-mounted, solar installations have become common investments for businesses thanks to technology gains and improved project economics through tax incentives.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), however, enacted rollbacks impacting the solar ITC, including an accelerated termination date of December 31, 2027 for certain projects and more stringent beginning-of-construction rules. Despite the changes, solar projects remain attractive investments, but could be up against a running clock. As such, now is the time for data centers to explore how solar can enhance operations and cash flow.

Energy storage

The IRA placed a major emphasis on energy storage investments like battery and thermal systems. Batteries can be incorporated into data centers on a standalone basis to store grid-based electricity or by being integrated with photovoltaic arrays to store solar-generated power. In both cases, they can play a major role in energy peak shaving and back-up generation while supporting sustainability goals.

Fuel cells

Fuel cells generate electricity through a chemical reaction, often by combining hydrogen and oxygen. As a secondary energy source at data centers, they can be used for backup power or during high peak times. Fuel cells can further integrate with combined heat and power systems and storage technology to create a microgrid environment, allowing data centers to operate independently from the main grid during outages or peak demand. With a boost under the IRA, fuel cells can generate significant ITCs, often at a rate of 30% or higher.

Geothermal cooling

Geothermal cooling is a highly energy-efficient option for absorbing the large amount of heat data centers generate. It leverages the stable temperatures found underground to help regulate the temperature of the facility and serve chilled water needs for industrial processes. Geothermal heat pump systems provide a reliable, year-round heat sink (or source), reducing reliance on traditional HVAC systems.

The ITC for geothermal can be quite generous thanks in part to the extensive list of system components that can be used toward the credit. With a comprehensive geothermal ITC analysis, nearly the entirety of a facility’s heating and cooling systems can be claimed in some circumstances.

How do cost segregation and bonus depreciation apply for data centers?

A cost segregation study is a tax strategy used by property owners to increase cash flow by accelerating depreciation deductions. This is done by segregating building assets — which are generally depreciated over 39 years — into shorter-lived assets that may qualify for faster depreciation periods of 5, 7, or 15 years.

These shorter-lived assets are also generally eligible for bonus depreciation, which was restored to 100% and made permanent under the OBBBA for property acquired and placed in service after January 19, 2025.

Below are common data center assets that can often qualify for shorter tax lives and full expensing with bonus depreciation:

Servers and racking

Networking equipment (e.g., routers, switches)

Electrical dedicated to processing/computing assets

Dedicated cooling equipment and piping

Certain renewable energy assets and improvements

How can the section 179D deduction impact data centers?

Often overlooked by data centers, Section 179D is a deduction available for energy efficient commercial buildings that can exceed $5 per square foot. The deduction specifically applies to certain energy-related components like interior lighting, HVAC, and a building’s envelope (e.g., insulation, windows, roofing). For a building to qualify, it must meet certain energy efficiency requirements and be certified by a properly credentialed energy professional.

For building owners that missed claiming the Section 179D deduction when their qualifying building was placed in service, the deduction can be claimed in a subsequent year without having to amend tax returns. This is done by filing an accounting method change on IRS Form 3115 to “catch up” the missed deductions. (The Form 3115 process is also available for depreciation changes resulting from a cost segregation study).

Section 179D, when combined with a cost segregation and bonus depreciation, can result in immediate expensing of the majority of a data center’s structural and non-structural assets. Companies, however, need to evaluate Section 179D now because the OBBBA accelerated its termination date to June 30, 2026 for property that has not begun construction on or before such date.

In today’s edition of Projects Weekly, we’re looking at selection of large-scale solar projects, as well as acquisitions impacting market. First off is Titan Energy and Greenskies Clean Focus partnership to bring rooftop solar to the Soundview Family YMCA in Connecticut. Zelestra has closed on a U.S. tax equity transaction for the 81 MW Jasper County Solar project in Indiana. Fullmark Energy has completed the 65 MW San Jacinto Energy Storage project in California. Dispatch Energy has acquires Green Lantern Solar and its distributed generation (DG) footprint across nine states. And finally, RWE completed its first project in Louisiana. Let’s get to it!

Titan Energy, Greenskies partner on innovative solar roof lease project

Titan Energy and Greenskies Clean Focus have completed a unique renewable energy project with the Soundview Family YMCA in Branford, Connecticut, delivering financial and sustainability benefits to the community-focused organization.

“This project demonstrates how nonprofit organizations like the Soundview Family YMCA can achieve meaningful financial savings while advancing sustainability goals,” said Kyle Ramm, managing director at Titan Energy. “By leveraging creative energy strategies, we were able to deliver long-term benefits without upfront cost. We’re proud to partner with Greenskies to complete such an impactful project.”

Cool factor: Unlike a traditional power purchase agreement (PPA), this project was structured as a roof lease. By hosting solar panels on its rooftop, the Soundview Family YMCA will receive approximately $20,000 annually from Greenskies — providing a consistent, long-term revenue stream without requiring any upfront investment or changes to existing energy systems.

The Soundview Family YMCA’s facility already operates a combined heat and power (CHP) system that covers much of its electricity and heating needs. To ensure compatibility and avoid interfering with the CHP system, Titan Energy and Greenskies structured the solar project to deliver power directly to Eversource’s grid under the state’s Non-residential Renewable Energy System (NRES) program. This arrangement allows the Soundview Family YMCA to benefit from annual lease payments while Greenskies generates clean energy for the regional grid.

In addition, the project implemented a series of additional energy-saving measures, reducing its Eversource utility costs at no out-of-pocket expense to the organization. Together, these efforts align with the Soundview Family YMCA’s core motivation: lowering operational costs while advancing its commitment to sustainability.

“This project is a great example of how creative solar structures can deliver tangible value to mission-driven organizations,” said Ryan Linares, VP of Real Estate of Greenskies Clean Focus. “By partnering with Titan Energy and the Soundview Family YMCA, we were able to turn unused roof space into a reliable source of revenue, helping the YMCA strengthen its financial foundation while contributing to a cleaner energy future for the broader community.”

Zelestra closes on tax equity transaction for 81 MW Jasper County Solar Project

Zelestra has secured tax equity funding of approximately $60 million from Stonehenge Capital for the 81 MWdc (60 MWac) Jasper County Solar Project. Located in Jasper County, Indiana, the project has a long-term environmental attributes purchase agreement (EAPA) with Meta, one of six in total that the two companies have in partnership across the United States. The project will be fully operational in Q4 2025.

“This marks another significant milestone in our commitment to deliver projects that meet our clients’ needs,” said Sybil Milo Cioffi, Zelestra’s U.S. CFO. “We look forward to celebrating the completion of Jasper later this year, and to advancing our 1 GW of fully contracted projects now moving toward construction and expected to be operational in the next two years.”

Cool factor: This significant milestone follows the announcement in April 2025 that the company closed a $113 million project financing for the project with Banco Santander. Zelestra is advancing its position in the U.S. energy landscape with innovative, multi-technology solutions tailored to the evolving needs of hyperscalers and corporate partners. Headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, the company is developing a robust portfolio of more than 10 GW of renewable energy projects across key markets.

“The collaboration with Zelestra exemplifies Stonehenge Capital’s focus on supporting energy infrastructure throughout the nation,” said Whitney LaNasa, senior managing director at Stonehenge Capital. “We look forward to working alongside Zelestra, a distinguished name in global energy, to bring this project to operations.”

With a portfolio of approximately 32 GW of carbon-free projects in six key growth markets (U.S., Germany, Spain, Italy, Latam and India), 6.8 GW is contracted with customers and in operations, construction, or pre-construction stage.

Fullmark Energy completes 65 MW San Jacinto Energy Storage Project

Fullmark Energy has announced the commercial operations date (COD) of its 65 MW / 130 MWh San Jacinto storage project in Banning, California. The milestone marks the final project within Fullmark Energy’s Redwood Projects portfolio — a strategic collection of energy storage facilities across Southern California — to achieve commercial operations.

“Reaching commercial operations across the Redwood Projects marks a major milestone for our team and our partners,” said Chris McKissack, Chief Executive Officer of Fullmark Energy. “These projects strengthen grid reliability, accelerate the renewable energy transition, and demonstrate our team’s ability to deliver high-performing assets at scale. San Jacinto is particularly meaningful because it shows how energy storage can simultaneously enhance grid infrastructure while revitalizing communities and creating value for local stakeholders.”

Cool factor: San Jacinto is Fullmark’s third project to reach COD in 2025, joining three other operational facilities in Fullmark Energy’s Redwood Projects portfolio. The 20 MW / 80 MWh Johanna ESS project in Santa Ana reached COD in October 2021, while the 20 MW / 40 MWh Desert-Carris project in Palm Springs and the 20 MW / 40 MWh Ortega Project in Lake Elsinore both reached COD earlier this year. These three 2025 projects deliver 105 MW of new capacity to the Southern California Edison distribution system.

The San Jacinto project exemplifies how energy storage development can drive positive community transformation. The 65 MW facility sits on previously abandoned property that had become an overgrown, nuisance property, creating challenges for surrounding residents and businesses. Working closely with local stakeholders, Fullmark transformed the site into well-maintained infrastructure with proper security fencing and lighting, significantly improving conditions for the neighborhood. The project also generates economic benefits for the city of Banning’s municipal electric utility, which serves approximately 13,500 customers and serves the project’s load.

The Redwood Projects represent 125 MW / 290 MWh of operational capacity across four strategically located facilities in Southern California, making it one of the largest independently owned battery storage portfolios in the region. The projects were developed with diversified offtake agreements to strengthen revenue profiles and reduce risk. In January 2023, Fullmark secured $100 million in financing for the portfolio through a consolidated term loan and letter of credit facility. All four facilities participate in the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) market, providing critical grid services including energy arbitrage, frequency regulation, and resource adequacy.

Dispatch Energy acquires Green Lantern Solar

Dispatch Energy LLC has acquired Green Lantern Solar (GLS), along with more than 64 solar and battery storage projects totaling 208.9 MWdc, at various stages of development and operations. This transaction brings Dispatch’s total portfolio to 489.5 MW, as the company works to aggregate distributed generation resources nationally.

“This acquisition provides an excellent result for GLS shareholders and employees,” said Luke Shullenberger, founder and CEO of Green Lantern Solar. “We appreciate the execution-oriented approach of Dispatch Energy’s team and believe that the business will continue to grow under their leadership into the future.”

This acquisition expands Dispatch’s footprint in the growing distributed generation market across Georgia, Maryland, West Virginia, New York, New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.

RWE’s first project in Louisiana completes construction

RWE has completed construction of its first project in Louisiana, the 100 MW Lafitte Solar project located in the Ouachita Parish, outside of Monroe. The project will be fully online and generating energy by the end of the year. Lafitte Solar was enabled through a long-term Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Meta, through which Meta also receives all environmental benefits associated with the project, including RECs.

“Lafitte Solar is RWE’s first project in Louisiana, and will provide low-cost, homegrown energy to the Louisiana grid and generate enough electricity to power 17,000 local homes and businesses,” said Andrew Flanagan, CEO of RWE Clean Energy. “By providing affordable and reliable electricity, we are strengthening Monroe’s power supply while supporting the community’s growth and resilience.”

The project was celebrated at a ribbon-cutting ceremony attended by Monroe Mayor Friday Ellis, local officials from the Ouachita Parish Police Jury and Ouachita Parish Industrial Development Board, RWE leadership and employees and construction partner McCarthy Building Companies (McCarthy).

Cool factor: Over its operating lifetime, Lafitte Solar is projected to generate approximately $32 million in regional tax revenue — supporting public schools, law enforcement and emergency services. Construction of Lafitte Solar was completed in collaboration with RWE’s EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) partner McCarthy, supporting more than 150 full-time jobs on the project at its peak. During construction, workers supported local businesses and restaurants, and shopped at area stores, amplifying the project’s economic impact.

RWE remains dedicated to supporting local schools and families. The company partnered with Roy Neal Shelling, Sr. Elementary School, providing donations to support classroom resources, while its construction partner McCarthy supplied toys during the holiday. RWE and McCarthy remain committed to improving the quality of life for children in the local area by funding a new playground being built at Tanglewood Community Park. Additionally, RWE and McCarthy together provided one of the largest holiday food donations the Food Bank of Northeast Louisiana has received, supporting families throughout Monroe during the Christmas season.

Lafitte Solar’s site design features natural and native vegetation around the perimeter, promoting biodiversity and habitat conservation to benefit the project’s land and surrounding farmlands. The project will also incorporate agrivoltaics, using a flock of over 600 sheep to maintain healthy vegetation onsite. This practice not only protects local farmland but deepens partnerships with regional farmers, demonstrating how renewable energy coexists with agriculture.

By Joshua T. Bledsoe, Nikki Buffa, Jennifer K. Roy, Nolan Fargo, and Samantha Yeager

The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has approved Texas’s application to assume primary enforcement responsibility, or “primacy,” for Class VI underground injection control (UIC) wells within the state. Class VI UIC wells are used for the permanent geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide in deep underground rock formations. Under the final rule, the Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC) will become the permitting authority for Class VI wells statewide. For more details on the proposed rule to grant Texas primacy, see this Latham blog post.

EPA’s approval follows a comprehensive technical and legal review of Texas’s program revision application, which concluded that the state’s statutes, regulations, and administrative framework for permitting and regulating Class VI UIC wells meet the federal requirements under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Texas already administers UIC programs for other well classes. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality oversees Class I (deep waste disposal), III (mineral extraction), IV (hazardous waste in groundwater cleanup), and V (non-hazardous fluid disposal) wells. The RRC oversees certain Class V wells (shallow geothermal injection wells) and Class II (oil and gas waste disposal and enhanced oil recovery wells).

Class VI primacy could accelerate permitting for carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects by leveraging local technical expertise and Texas’s established regulatory infrastructure.

Federal and State Support for Texas Primacy

The final rule garnered support from federal and state officials, who emphasized the potential benefits of granting Texas primacy. RRC Chairman Jim Wright called it “an important step forward for [the] state’s energy sector” that could serve “to reduce regulatory overlap.” According to Senator John Cornyn, primacy allows Texas “to have more control over its own permitting process and improve efficiency.”

The RRC reports that it has already received 18 Class VI UIC well applications and is aware of additional projects being planned across the state.

Broader Trend

Texas joins a growing list of states with Class VI primacy, including Louisiana, North Dakota, West Virginia, and Wyoming. Most recently, EPA granted Arizona primacy for all UIC well classes. These approvals underscore a broader national trend toward state-level administration of CCS permitting.

What’s Next

EPA’s final rule will take effect December 15, 2025. Project proponents should track the RRC’s Class VI program implementation — including application forms, guidance, and timelines — and prepare to participate in state permitting processes.

EPA told CCJ on Monday the agency continues to reevaluate the rule and plans to propose a rule in the spring of 2026 that will take effect the following model year.
The new limits currently tighten tailpipe NOx emissions to a level 80%-plus below the current standard and reduce the particulate matter limit by 50%.

The American Trucking Associations, National Tank Truck Carriers, Truckload Carriers Association, and 49 state trucking associations in August penned a letter to EPA, asking the regulator to push implementation to 2031, citing ""substantial compliance costs and operational burdens at a time when the trucking industry is already contending with historically difficult market conditions.""

Administrator Lee Zeldin in March announced EPA was reevaluating the Biden-era 2022 Heavy-Duty Engine and Vehicle rule that regulates oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and other emissions beginning with Model Year 2027.

EPA told CCJ on Monday the agency continues to reevaluate the rule and plans to propose a rule in the spring of 2026 that will take effect the following model year.

""If finalized,"" EPA said, ""the action will make major changes to the program requirements while maintaining the Model Year 2027 start of the standards, which can significantly reduce the cost of new heavy-duty vehicles, while still protecting human health and the environment, and avoiding regulatory distortions of the heavy-duty vehicle market.""

A spokesperson for Daimler Truck North America told CCJ Monday that the company appreciates EPA's efforts to reduce costs while maintaining a focus on air quality and legislative consistency, adding ""[This] announcement provides the regulatory certainty needed for effective production planning and customer support.""

The decision to remain on course is somewhat of a reversal in recent emissions policy that has seen EPA dismantle California’s vehicle emissions standards, target for repeal the Endangerment Finding — which would roll back the Greenhouse Gas Phase 3 rule — and help unravel the Clean Truck Partnership between California and truck and engine manufacturers.

The new limits currently tighten tailpipe NOx emissions to a level 80%-plus below the current standard and reduce the particulate matter limit by 50%. The agency also will require that OEMs extend warranties to 450,000 miles from 100,000 and useful life limits to 650,000 miles from 435,000 miles.

The standards require heavy-duty commercial vehicles to limit nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions to 0.035 grams per horsepower-hour during normal operation, 0.050 grams at low load, and 10.0 grams at idle, and will also increase the useful life of governed vehicles by 1.5 to 2.5 times and yield emissions warranties that are 2.8 to 4.5 times longer — provisions that guarantee that as vehicles age, they will continue to meet EPA’s more stringent emissions standards for a longer period of time.

The price drop is set to squeeze Russian oil companies’ finances and shrink tax revenues for the Kremlin—funds that help sustain the war in Ukraine.
For a country where oil and gas make up about a quarter of the state budget, it’s truly remarkable that—with all the geopolitical turmoil—oil prices are not climbing higher.
Given the expected cold weather, crude oil prices are unlikely to decrease much further, and there remains considerable risk of a price spike in the coming month.
Across the United States, the scale of data center development is remarkable.","It’s astonishing that oil prices aren’t soaring higher, given the dramatic headlines. Ukraine has managed to strike deep into Russia with long-range drones, hitting one of the country’s top ten refineries at Novokuybyshevsk and a military base—an operation confirmed by Ukraine’s General Staff and reported by the Kyiv Independent.

Meanwhile, in the Gulf of Oman, the Marshall Islands-flagged tanker Talara was intercepted and diverted by Iranian Revolutionary Guards on November 14, suspected of carrying unauthorized goods. US Central Command and UKMTO have issued warnings about persistent threats in the region, urging extreme caution for maritime transit.

Yet, despite these significant disruptions, Russia’s flagship oil price just plunged to its lowest in over two and a half years, mere days before new U.S. sanctions are set to target the nation’s two biggest producers. The price drop is set to squeeze Russian oil companies’ finances and shrink tax revenues for the Kremlin—funds that help sustain the war in Ukraine. Discounts on Urals crude widened to an average of $23.52 per barrel below last week, the biggest gap since June 2023, according to Argus data. On Thursday, Urals crude from the Black Sea port of Novorossiysk plummeted to $36.61 a barrel, its lowest since March 2023, with a similar story in the Baltic Sea market. Prices did inch up on Friday, but the trend remains surprising.

For a country where oil and gas make up about a quarter of the state budget, it’s truly remarkable that—with all the geopolitical turmoil—oil prices are not climbing higher. Oil continues to kind of struggle and because some Russian refineries are down, it’s assumed they’ll be dumping cheap barrels of crude even though no one wants to buy them right now. Given the expected cold weather, crude oil prices are unlikely to decrease much further, and there remains considerable risk of a price spike in the coming month.

The other big picture is the demand for artificial intelligence and data centers. Market watcher Tom Conrick wrote that Web Services (AWS) is making a historic investment in Indiana, with a massive $13 billion data center campus under construction between South Bend and New Carlisle. This project, which marks the largest single corporate investment in the state’s history, spans over 600 acres acquired through the shell company Razor5. Located along Indiana State Road 2 and Larrison Boulevard, the campus features at least seven buildings, each measuring 216,000 square feet, with their shells already completed.

The scale of the investment has grown from its initial $11 billion announcement, and AWS expects to create 1,000 jobs for both its own staff and contract workers. The company has secured sales tax exemptions for eligible capital investments over a 50-year period. Construction is moving at an “unprecedented” pace, with the first facilities scheduled to become operational in the first quarter of 2025. AWS has already started recruiting for technical and operations positions, underscoring the project’s momentum.

This new campus is strategically significant, as it will support AWS’s expanding need for cloud services and AI workloads. The development is also positioned near the $3.5 billion / electric vehicle battery plant, signaling the emergence of a high-tech corridor in northern Indiana. Similar activity is underway elsewhere in the country, including Chicago, where the former CBOE Global Markets headquarters is being converted into a 33-megawatt data center by Legacy Investing, a Virginia-based real estate firm. The building, which sold in October 2025 following upgrades to its power capacity, is expected to complete its transformation by late 2026. Another notable example in Chicago is the former R.R. Donnelley printing plant, now the Lakeside Technology Center at 350 East Cermak Road, recognized as one of the world’s largest data centers and a major internet interconnection hub.

Across the United States, the scale of data center development is remarkable. More than 3,000 facilities are currently tracked for development, expansion, or retrofitting. In August 2025 alone, 10.5 gigawatts of planned capacity were filed, representing billions of dollars of investment in states such as Texas, Kansas, and New Mexico. The year-to-date construction value for 2025 stands at $12.9 billion, a 48% increase over the previous year, with $2.4 billion in new projects launched in June. The South and Midwest are especially active, with states like Ohio, Georgia, Arizona, and Texas leading the charge. Major projects include Amazon’s $2 billion facility in Sunbury, Ohio, Google’s $600 million data center in Mesa, Arizona, and the $100 billion Stargate joint venture by OpenAI, , and .

Infrastructure trends show rising power demand, prompting increased investment in energy infrastructure, while the acceleration of AI and cloud computing is driving the construction of hyperscale and edge data centers. Many previously paused projects are now resuming construction, reflecting renewed confidence in the sector. As of mid-2025, about 404 data centers are actively under construction across the U.S. ’s CEO, Jensen Huang, has noted that these developments will require hundreds of thousands of electricians and plumbers, highlighting the significant workforce implications of the ongoing data center boom.

is going to be a big part of that and the weather is going to be a big part of natural gas pricing. Fox Weather reported that, “Record-breaking November heat wave grips the South after major deep freeze for millions. The heat surge isn’t done yet, with the warmth shifting to the Southern Plains and Southeast this week. Over 100 million Americans are expected to experience warmer-than-normal temperatures to start the week. Fox Weather says that It has been a whirlwind of weather across parts of the U.S. since last week, as some states experienced freezing temperatures before jumping back into late spring-like heat. Last week, some areas in the Southeast experienced record-breaking low temperatures amid a fall freeze.

According to the FOX Forecast Center, over 80 record low temperatures were broken before the start of the weekend.

Fewer solar developers reported delays in the third quarter of 2025 compared to the same period last year, the Energy Information Administration said in a Nov. 10 report.

In the third quarter this year, “solar projects representing about 20% of planned capacity reported a delay, a decrease from 25% in the same period in 2024,” EIA said.

“Despite the relatively high number of projects reporting delays in 2024, that year was a record year for U.S. solar capacity additions,” EIA said. Developers added around 31 gigawatts of utility-scale solar capacity last year, though their projections at the beginning of the year forecasted 36 GW in additions.

“Because survey respondents may not anticipate the occurrence or duration of delays, ultimate capacity additions tend to be less than the expected amount that developers report to us at the beginning of the year,” EIA said. The agency said in February that it predicts 32.5 GW of utility-scale solar will be added this year, indicating that less solar may come online this year than last year, despite the decrease in delays.

EIA also noted that delays are more common than cancellations, and “less than 1% of planned solar capacity is entirely cancelled in a typical month … Much of the reported delayed capacity occurs at projects that are in the late construction or testing phases just before they come online. These delays are typically only for a month or two.”

Justin Baca, vice president of markets and research at the Solar Energy Industries Association, said in an email to ESG Dive sister publication Utility Dive that it’s “important to note that most of the solar capacity that has come online this year began construction last year.”

“The vast majority of what began construction this year received permits prior to July of this year, when the memo from the Department of the Interior slowing permitting was released,” Baca said. “As such, this data does not yet reflect the recent permitting obstruction, including from the DOI memo.

Policymakers can build on this initiative by supporting the commercialization of technologies that could help address AI startups’ energy challenges.","What energy policy agenda will enable startups to compete in AI?

That question is becoming more urgent as AI’s exponential growth drives an unprecedented demand for electricity. The Department of Energy forecasts that data center electricity use will nearly triple to 12 percent of US supply by 2028, up from 4.4 percent in 2023. Yet this surge is colliding with an analog-era grid: as of late 2023, an astounding 2,600 gigawatts (GW) of new energy projects—over 95 percent of which are zero-carbon—were waiting in grid interconnection queues, a backlog more than double the entire installed capacity of the US power plant fleet.

This multi-year logjam creates more than just scarcity; it creates a two-tiered market that structurally disadvantages startups. Large, established hyperscalers can lock in long-term Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), securing billions of dollars in predictable energy and effectively buying out entire regions’ future power capacity. Startups don’t have this luxury. Lacking the scale and balance sheets to make such long-term commitments, startups cannot negotiate these priority positions and are left to face volatile spot markets and higher rates. Moreover, startups don’t have the legal teams or lobbying muscle to develop a bespoke AI energy policy agenda or to advance that agenda on Capitol Hill. Because of their comparative disadvantages in business and policy negotiations, the next generation of AI innovators may be denied access to the energy they need to compete with larger platforms; energy scarcity could become a durable competitive moat.

In AI, energy policy is not a peripheral concern; the challenge of “speed-to-power”—how fast a new data center can access energy—is key to competing in the AI industry. To ensure a level playing field, we need an AI energy policy agenda that works for startups.

This agenda should focus on three core concepts:

Generating energy abundance

Ensuring fair energy access

Innovating in energy supply and demand

The Abundance Agenda: More Supply, Lower Costs

AI’s energy demands require more supply. Without enough energy, costs increase and both large and small developers will face obstacles to building new AI tools. As the administration’s AI Action Plan recognizes, the foundational pillar of a forward-thinking energy policy must therefore focus on dramatically increasing the total supply of energy and data center capacity to lower costs for everyone.

Momentum for a pro-abundance energy agenda is increasingly bipartisan, with leaders from the Trump administration to the Democratic mayor of Silicon Valley’s largest city, championing robust reforms to expand energy supply and accelerate infrastructure buildout. Journalists Derek Thompson and Ezra Klein have provided an intellectual framework for abundance policy, articulating how supply-side solutions can underpin America’s competitiveness and innovation. Organizations such as the Abundance Institute and the Niskanen Center are researching and advocating for policy to realize a future of plentiful, affordable energy, bridging ideological divides and shaping a common path forward. This emerging consensus reflects a rare moment in contemporary policy where growth, innovation, and economic opportunity are rallying points across parties and institutions.

Policymakers are starting to realize the importance of expanding energy access. For example, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued Order No. 2023, which aims to reform the grid interconnection process and clear backlogs by shifting to a “first-ready, first-served” cluster study model. More recently, the Trump administration’s AI Action Plan calls for fast-tracking energy infrastructure construction, and Congress has held hearings on the energy needs of the AI sector. States are also heavily engaged in energy policy—some, fearing strain on the energy grid, are reconsidering existing data-center incentives or considering proposals that would require more transparency about data center energy usage, while others are doubling down on encouraging more AI activity within their borders.

But policymakers should take additional steps to reduce burdens to energy production and access:

Accelerate energy permitting. Speed up federal and state permitting for new energy generation and transmission infrastructure to allow supply to more rapidly meet demand from the AI sector. This should be coupled with a concerted effort to streamline and standardize the state and local permitting processes for data center siting.

Design smart transparency rules. Step cautiously in enacting data center transparency mandates—proposals that would require operators to report on metrics like energy consumption and water usage. There were more than 20 such bills introduced in 2025 alone. Any new transparency rules should be carefully designed to avoid slowing the construction of new capacity or imposing burdensome compliance costs that will disproportionately affect startups, given their small teams and limited budgets.

Unlock existing grid capacity. Reform outdated utility regulations that discourage the use of innovative grid-enhancing technologies. Incentivizing the deployment of these modern optimization tools could unlock as much as 100 GW of capacity on existing power lines.

Invest in the workforce. We must invest in the skilled workforce needed to build this new infrastructure. Addressing critical labor shortages, particularly for electricians, is not only essential to removing a key bottleneck for deployment but also represents a major opportunity to create a new generation of high-paying jobs for skilled trade workers across the country.

While boosting supply is paramount, we must also continue to innovate in efficiency. It’s crucial to increase public R&D for more energy-efficient AI, spanning both hardware and algorithms. However, we must also be clear-eyed about the limits of this approach. Efficiency gains alone are insufficient to address the demand problem, as improvements in efficiency frequently trigger increased consumption, a phenomenon known as the Jevons Paradox.

The Pro-Competitive Agenda: Ensuring Fair Access

While an abundance of energy is critical for both startups and large hyperscalers, it’s insufficient on its own to foster a competitive AI ecosystem. Policies that create more supply must be accompanied by policies that distribute that supply fairly. Preferential energy access would create new barriers to AI development, favoring large players over startups. To avoid this outcome, energy policy must address the structural disadvantages startups face in the energy and compute markets.

The cornerstone of fair, balanced access is ensuring that startups do not pay for the energy needs of hyperscalers. Large-scale AI deployment could increase energy costs for everyone else: a single hyperscale data center can require grid upgrades costing billions of dollars. If policy permits these costs to be “socialized” across all ratepayers rather than being borne directly by the entity causing them, startups will be disadvantaged.

For instance, a large hyperscaler could negotiate a custom contract with a state utility to power a new data center, a project requiring costly, large-scale upgrades to transmission lines and substations. If state regulators, eager to attract the investment, allow the utility to recover those upgrade costs across its entire customer base—overall electricity rates for all other customers will rise. Simultaneously, this type of project could consume all planned grid capacity in the region for years to come, leaving startups unable to secure power for their own smaller facilities. If costs rise due to hyperscaler demand, but hyperscalers don’t pay for this increased price, then residential customers and smaller businesses—including startups—would effectively subsidize the energy infrastructure of their largest competitors.

To prevent this outcome, policymakers could implement a “causer pays” principle that requires large-load users to directly fund the grid upgrades they require, rather than socializing these costs. This ensures that the entities driving increased demand are the ones who bear the financial responsibility for the necessary infrastructure improvements.

Fairness should also extend to energy procurement. To correct the imbalance caused by large companies securing favorable long-term PPA terms, policymakers and energy regulators should establish aggregated purchasing programs that allow startups to pool their demand, giving them the collective bargaining power needed to secure the same competitive energy contracts.

Energy policy should also reduce barriers to entry in AI by ensuring startups have access to the foundational resources needed for innovation. The immense cost of high-performance computing can prevent promising ideas from ever being developed. As we have written previously, the federal government can address this challenge by establishing a National AI Competitiveness Institute (NAICI), which would provide startups, researchers, and nonprofits with access to the infrastructure they need, including compute power, data, and model evaluation resources. By providing direct access to these energy-intensive computing resources, the NAICI would help startups manage the high infrastructure costs that can cut off their ability to innovate, making it easier for Little Tech to compete with larger platforms in building and testing new AI models.

The Innovation Agenda: Unleashing New Approaches to Energy Supply and Demand

Startups cannot compete with hyperscalers on sheer capital expenditure; their strength lies in their innovation and agility. Policy must create opportunities for them to leverage these unique advantages. A forward-looking strategy should focus on enabling startups to capitalize on their operational flexibility and participate in the development of next-generation energy technologies.

A key area for innovation is demand-side flexibility: the ability of energy consumers to actively manage when and how much electricity they use in response to the needs of the grid. State utility commissions, for instance, could direct utilities in their jurisdictions to offer innovative tariffs, like real-time pricing, which would allow startups to significantly reduce costs by shifting their computational workloads to off-peak hours when power is cheaper.

Furthermore, state and federal policymakers can increase startup access to demand response programs, which pay companies to temporarily reduce their energy use during periods of high grid stress. Lowering participation barriers for these programs would enable agile startups to generate revenue simply by pausing non-critical workloads, turning their operational agility into a direct economic advantage.

At the same time, policy should promote the development of next-generation power sources that can provide the 24/7 clean energy that AI data centers require, such as Small Modular Reactors (SMRs). To accelerate SMR deployment, policymakers must build on the important progress of the bipartisan 2024 ADVANCE Act, which began to address the high cost of licensing through reducing certain fees and authorizing prize competitions to cover regulatory costs for innovators. Policymakers should ensure this new framework succeeds by conducting oversight to confirm the law’s regulatory reforms are being implemented effectively.

Likewise, advanced geothermal energy is a promising source of the 24/7 clean power that AI data centers require, but its deployment is severely hampered by complex permitting processes that can take seven to ten years on federal land. To accelerate this technology, policy should focus on speeding up federal leasing and drilling permits to reduce these costly development delays.

The Department of Energy’s recent funding for emerging technologies like AI and nuclear energy is a welcome step. Policymakers can build on this initiative by supporting the commercialization of technologies that could help address AI startups’ energy challenges.

For any new technology that expands energy supply or mitigates energy demand, startups must have equal access to the opportunity. To prevent large platforms from securing exclusive access to these new energy resources, legislators and regulators could mandate that utility development partnerships include opportunities for startup participation, either as energy off-takers, who purchase shares of the generated power, or as co-locators, who physically site their facilities at the new power source.

Securing America’s Energy Advantage in AI

The race for AI leadership could be won or lost on the electrical grid. The policy landscape, designed for a pre-AI era and predisposed to favor large providers over startups, now risks creating insurmountable barriers for the next generation of innovators. The path forward is not to simply power the nascent AI sector, but to ensure that energy policy does not leave small AI developers behind.

By embracing a comprehensive strategy built on abundance, pro-competitive market access, and a commitment to innovation, we can move beyond the zero-sum mindset of scarcity and toward a future where startups have affordable access to the energy they need. Let’s ensure the best ideas—not just the biggest balance sheets—have the power they need to win.",https://d1lamhf6l6yk6d.cloudfront.net/uploads/2025/11/Energy-Policy-Agenda-for-Ensure-a-Thriving-AI-Market-X.png,N,,2025-11-17 17:01:51.261571

And now for your environmental reports:

Indiana’s Recycling Market Development Board just awarded six Indiana organizations with $2 million in grant funding to expand recycling across the state, a decision expected to create 42 new jobs and prevent an additional 197,884 tons of materials from going into landfills annually.

The grant recipients aren’t just community recycling bins. They span themes of textile waste, food waste, and lumber production. Goodwill Industries of Michiana will receive over $300,000 to buy new equipment that will let them recycle more textiles and phase out 4 million plastic bags used by Goodwill shoppers. Greencycle in Marion County will dedicate over $450,000 to a wood waste grinder that will process more than 21,000 tons each year. And in LaPorte County, Nexus IN RNG received $500,000 to buy equipment that will divert 105,000 tons of organic waste—that’s food waste—from landfills each year, while also creating new jobs for this project.

The grant money comes from the Recycling Promotion and Assistance Fund, which is funded by a per-ton fee on solid waste disposed of at Indiana landfills. This means the fees we pay when trash goes to the landfill help fund programs that keep trash out of landfills in the first place. Indiana currently diverts about 19% of waste from landfills through recycling and composting, but the state’s goal is 50%. These grants are part of the effort to close that gap—turning waste into resources, creating jobs, and building what experts call a “circular economy” where materials get reused instead of buried.

COP30

This week, thousands of diplomats and climate experts began gathering in Brazil—right at the edge of the Amazon rainforest—for COP30, the latest round of United Nations climate talks.

This conference takes place November 10-21 and is being called the Amazon COP or even the Nature COP—a moment for the world to see what’s at stake through Brazil’s eyes.

For the first time, more than 1,000 Indigenous representatives will have access to the main negotiation venue. Brazil is proposing something called the Tropical Forest Forever Facility, which would financially reward countries for protecting forests rather than cutting them down. The Amazon covers 6.5 million square kilometers, holds 13% of known species on the planet, and stores between 150 and 200 billion tons of carbon—that’s equivalent to 15-20 years of global carbon emissions. But over 17% of the forest in Brazilian territory has already been cut down, and 31% is degraded. Scientists have warned that losing just 5% more could push the forest past a tipping point, irreversibly transforming it into a savanna and releasing 300 billion tons of carbon into the atmosphere, making it impossible to meet the Paris Agreement’s climate targets.

The conference will also focus on mobilizing $1.3 trillion a year in climate finance to help developing countries adapt to climate change. As one Brazilian climate leader put it, “Our window to prevent runaway climate change is closing fast. The next five years will determine the next hundred years. The world is looking to Brazil to show that a standing forest is worth more than one that’s cut down.”

The White House has confirmed that no high-level U.S. officials would be in attendance, likely due to Trump’s repeated insistence that human-caused climate change is a hoax.

Instead, California Governor Gavin Newsom and New Mexico’s Michelle Lujan Grisham have been the United States’ unofficial ambassadors. Whether COP30 becomes a turning point on climate progress or another round of unfulfilled promises will depend on whether world leaders choose action over politics, and implementation over negotiation.

Aurora Borealis Shows Off

GRIFFY LAKE via FACEBOOK -

Longtime Bloomington residents were stunned by a rare sighting on Tuesday evening—a glimpse of the incredible Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights, dancing across our Midwest skies. The fantastical display of colors and lights was visible in Indiana and reached as far south as Florida with displays of green, red, and purple waves of light.

The sun is at the peak of its 11-year cycle, called solar maximum. The aurora occurred when the sun sent several bursts of energy called coronal mass ejections that reached Earth Tuesday night and early Wednesday. Forecasters explain that this created a severe geomagnetic storm and when those charged particles from the sun collide with gases in Earth’s atmosphere, they create these colorful light shows. Usually, you’d have to travel hundreds of miles north to see the aurora, but during strong storms like this one, they can stretch much farther south.

If you missed the display this week, you don’t need to book your ticket to the Arctic Circle just yet—we’re likely to see more of the aurora borealis over the next several months as the sun continues through this active phase. Nature’s light show might just be coming to our skies again soon.

The new facility will span over one million square feet and is designed for the production of First Solar’s Series 7 thin-film solar modules.
The investment is part of a broader strategy to solidify First Solar’s U.S. manufacturing base.
This South Carolina announcement follows a separate $1.1 billion investment in new capacity, which includes a new factory in Louisiana and expansion of its existing Ohio footprint, both expected to be operational in 2025.
The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) includes advanced manufacturing production credits designed to incentivize domestic production of solar components.","First Solar announced it will invest $330 million in a U.S. module manufacturing facility in Gaffney, South Carolina.

The new facility will span over one million square feet and is designed for the production of First Solar’s Series 7 thin-film solar modules. The plant is scheduled to commence commercial operations in the second half of 2026.

This expansion will add an estimated 600 new jobs to the region. It is projected to increase First Solar’s total U.S. annual production capacity to 17.7 gigawatts (GW), adding 3.7 GW of new capacity.

The investment is part of a broader strategy to solidify First Solar’s U.S. manufacturing base. The company currently operates facilities in Perrysburg and Lake Township, Ohio. This South Carolina announcement follows a separate $1.1 billion investment in new capacity, which includes a new factory in Louisiana and expansion of its existing Ohio footprint, both expected to be operational in 2025.

First Solar utilizes a thin-film technology platform that differs from traditional silicon-based solar panels. The company states its modules have a carbon footprint that is up to 30% lower than that of typical crystalline silicon PV panels manufactured in China.

The company’s expansion is occurring in a market influenced by U.S. industrial policy. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) includes advanced manufacturing production credits designed to incentivize domestic production of solar components. And this year’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act enacted Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) restrictions, barring solar projects from tax credits if they source products from Chinese businesses or businesses with substantial investment from Chinese entities.

“The passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the Administration’s trade policies boosted demand for American energy technology, requiring a timely, agile response that allows us to meet the moment,” said Mark Widmar, chief executive officer, First Solar. “We expect that this new facility will enable us to serve the US market with technology that is compliant with the Act’s stringent provisions, within timelines that align with our customers’ objectives.”

The move into South Carolina follows recent challenges for other manufacturers in the U.S. solar market. Qcells, another major producer, recently faced customs delays on components and furloughed workers in Georgia.

Why does this matter right now?

On September 30, 2025, the $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles vanished. No fanfare, no final countdown. For the EV industry, this is more than a fiscal shift; it’s a signal that growth now must stand on its own.

Research from Gartner Inc. notes EV shipments will grow in 2025, but subsidies won’t drive the next wave. The International Energy Agency reports that global EV production reached 17.3 million in 2024, with China accounting for much of that volume. Meanwhile, charging networks, pricing strategies, and consumer perceptions still present real hurdles. This is a now-or-never pivot for EVs in markets like the U.S.

How does it compare to rivals?

Consider the four models shaping the next chapter. The 2026 Nissan Leaf starts at about $29,900, offers ~250 miles of range, and has newly updated battery chemistry. It’s aimed at everyday buyers, not early-adopter trophy seekers. The Volkswagen ID. Buzz arrives as a three-row electric people-carrier with ~260 miles of range, 282 hp, and a cabin styled to turn heads, though at around $60,000 it demands a premium. The Ford Mustang Mach-E GT focuses on excitement: 480 hp, 634 lb-ft torque, 0–60 ~3.6 s, range ~250 miles, and 0% financing, rather than tax credits, as Ford’s incentive. Then the Audi A6 e-tron represents tech-luxury: up to ~321 miles range, 270 kW fast charging, panoramic OLED displays, and air suspension. In effect, affordable, fun, aspirational, and premium all co-exist. Yet the real competition is no longer just EV vs EV, it’s EV vs internal combustion, used car inflows, and hybrid crossover pressure. Value and infrastructure will decide winners.

If you’re an urban commuter looking for an affordable electric vehicle, the Leaf makes clear sense. Minimal frills but solid value. If you’re a family needing flexibility and want a bit of flair, the ID. Buzz offers personality and utility, assuming the higher price fits. If you crave performance, the Mach-E GT delivers, but keep in mind its firm ride, higher cost per mile, and less range than some might hope.

If luxury, tech sophistication, and status are your key metrics, the A6 e-tron delivers, but for a price. Conversely, if you live in a rural area without reliable fast chargers, or you’re on a tight budget where used models or hybrids dominate your choices, you might consider waiting. The subsidy era is over; the next wave demands readiness, both from buyers and infrastructure.

Tesla’s applications to open stores in Bismarck and Fargo, filed in 2024, were denied because state law prohibits vehicle manufacturers from selling directly to consumers.
Tesla, however, has appealed, claiming it should be exempt from the law since its sales model relies exclusively on direct-to-consumer sales throughout the United States.
Assistant North Dakota Attorney General Michael Pitcher, however, argued that the exemptions in state law do not apply to Tesla.
North Dakota and Louisiana have some of the lowest EV adoption rates, with electric vehicles accounting for just 1.3% and 1.4% of new car sales, respectively.","Tesla is suing North Dakota’s Department of Transportation after it has rejected its applications to open direct-to-consumer showrooms in the state.

The information was first revealed by The Bismarck Tribune, according to which the lawsuit was filed in August, with the first hearings scheduled for December.

Tesla’s applications to open stores in Bismarck and Fargo, filed in 2024, were denied because state law prohibits vehicle manufacturers from selling directly to consumers.

The state argues that this separation between manufacturers and dealerships is necessary to protect both franchise dealers and consumers.

Tesla, however, has appealed, claiming it should be exempt from the law since its sales model relies exclusively on direct-to-consumer sales throughout the United States.

Not a “Manufacturer”

The company argued that it does not technically meet the definition of a “manufacturer” because it does not sell new vehicles through third-party dealerships.

According to the lawsuit, North Dakota law defines a “manufacturer” as “any person who manufactures, assembles, or imports and sells new motor vehicles to new vehicle dealers for resale in the state.”

The company contends that even if it fits this definition, it should still be allowed to seek an exemption from the Department of Transportation, which permits manufacturers to operate a dealership if no independent dealer is available.

“Traditional motor vehicle manufacturers sell their vehicles through independent franchised dealers. Tesla, by contrast, sells its vehicles directly to customers throughout the United States,” the company wrote.

“As a result, Tesla has no franchised dealerships in any state,” the legal filings showed.

Assistant North Dakota Attorney General Michael Pitcher, however, argued that the exemptions in state law do not apply to Tesla.

They are intended only for temporary situations, such as when a manufacturer cannot immediately take over an existing dealership, in order to prevent market disruptions.

Tesla, by contrast, was seeking to establish its own permanent dealerships.

Unconstitutionality Claims

Tesla alleges that the Department of Transportation’s rejection violates the North Dakota Constitution, citing clauses that protect the “right to earn a livelihood” and the “right to equal protection.”

According to Tesla, North Dakota’s law unconstitutionally favors franchise dealerships.

“To the extent that the North Dakota Legislature or the Department seek to protect franchised dealerships from competition, that is not a reasonable legislative goal,” the filings read.

The Assistant Attorney General countered that establishing a franchise system is a legitimate way for the state Legislature to protect vehicle dealerships and does not infringe on any constitutional rights.

“North Dakota’s laws are not designed to shield dealers from competition per se, but from exploitation by manufacturers who could otherwise undercut them,” Pitcher wrote, adding that “Tesla, as a manufacturer, falls squarely within that concern.”

Direct Sales Ban in Other States

North Dakota isn’t the first state where Tesla has challenged dealership laws. The company has also filed petitions against similar direct-sales bans in Louisiana, Wisconsin, and several other states.

North Dakota and Louisiana have some of the lowest EV adoption rates, with electric vehicles accounting for just 1.3% and 1.4% of new car sales, respectively.

Only Mississippi is lower, at 1.2%.

By contrast, California — the state with the highest adoption rate — saw electric vehicles make up 29% of new car sales in the third quarter.",https://eletric-vehicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Tesla_Lincoln.webp,N,,2025-11-17 13:03:53.899416
