To transport the equipment from shipping barges to the CEP construction site, crews will move the modules over River Road using a temporary heavy-haul bridge.

Cornerstone Energy Park has grown into a multimillion-dollar industrial campus and is home to several companies that operate both independently and collaboratively.
And, with decades of history and major projects pointing to a cleaner, more resilient future, Cornerstone Energy Park remains a vital pillar of Jefferson Parish’s industrial landscape.","Cornerstone Chemical Company, LLC, a fixture of industry and community life in Waggaman for more than 70 years, is helping to usher in a new chapter of energy innovation and economic development in Jefferson Parish. Through continued modernization of the Cornerstone Energy Park (CEP) and major new investments from companies that share its commitment to safety, sustainability and long-term growth, the site is emerging as one of the Gulf Coast’s most important hubs for advanced manufacturing.

This transition will be especially visible in the coming months as UBE C1 Chemicals America (UCCA) begins the next phase of construction on a $500 million production facility inside CEP. The project will establish the first reliable U.S. supply of critical components used in energy storage systems — materials essential to building a more sustainable national energy future.

“This is an exciting time for Cornerstone Energy Park as we continue to forge partnerships focused on creating a sustainable future for the site,” said Jacques Byrd, Cornerstone Vice President of Site Development. “Please pardon our progress as we work to construct this vital facility and transition the Cornerstone Energy Park for a sustainable future.”

To construct the new facility efficiently and responsibly, UCCA is employing modular construction, a method increasingly used in advanced manufacturing projects around the world. In modular construction, equipment is built in smaller components off-site, transported by barge, and then assembled on location.

“Think of modular construction as putting together the pieces of a puzzle,” said UCCA President and CEO Tom Yura. “The pieces are built elsewhere, and the puzzle is assembled on-site. It’s a smarter way to build because it minimizes disruption to the community and reduces the duration of construction.”

These pre-built modules offer multiple advantages: improved efficiency and reduced construction time. To transport the equipment from shipping barges to the CEP construction site, crews will move the modules over River Road using a temporary heavy-haul bridge.

UCCA has selected Morimatsu, a contractor with more than 20 years of global experience moving modular components using hydraulic systems. “Morimatsu brings valuable knowledge and experience to assure project safety and efficiency,” Yura said.

As the modular equipment arrives and is transported onto the site, residents should expect intermittent road closures along River Road. Installation of the temporary bridge will be completed in early to mid-December. Shortly after, the modules will begin crossing the temporary bridge into CEP.

Temporary road closures are scheduled to begin in early December and last through February, when the temporary bridge is expected to be fully deconstructed. Until then, periodic road closures, typically lasting less than one hour, will occur outside of peak travel times.

“We are working with local authorities to help keep the community informed on River Road traffic conditions throughout the construction process,” said Ainslie Blanke, Cornerstone’s senior marketing and communications advisor. “Thank you for your patience as we make Jefferson Parish one of the country’s leaders in sustainable energy.”

Cornerstone and UCCA are coordinating with the Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office, U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Jefferson Parish Levee District and the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development to ensure all work is completed safely and efficiently.

Cornerstone Energy Park has grown into a multimillion-dollar industrial campus and is home to several companies that operate both independently and collaboratively. The shared focus aims to produce essential materials, support local jobs and prepare Louisiana’s petrochemical sector for a more sustainable future.

The UCCA facility represents the first U.S. production of its kind and deepens Jefferson Parish’s role as a location of choice for energy-forward projects. With sustainability top of mind, CEP and its site companies continue to upgrade technology and strengthen environmental stewardship.

“CEP is focused on transitioning the site for the future,” Byrd said. “The companies on our site share a commitment to safety, health and the environment. That unity is key to building long-term growth.”

As construction accelerates, the UCCA facility stands as both an industrial milestone and a signal of what’s to come: more green-energy jobs, enhanced manufacturing capacity and a stronger local economy built on innovation. And, with decades of history and major projects pointing to a cleaner, more resilient future, Cornerstone Energy Park remains a vital pillar of Jefferson Parish’s industrial landscape.

,Texas American Energy ,2025-11-30 05:22:51+00:00,Zeihan on Geopolitics,Can Anyone Replicate the US Shale Revolution? - Zeihan on Geopolitics,Peter Zeihan,,,,,https://zeihan.com/can-anyone-replicate-the-us-shale-revolution/,"And the United States has that because in the past, the North American continent, especially our part of it, has had a series of shallow seas.
Now with shale technology, you go down it until you hit that layer and then you go horizontally.
The shale revolution at this point is about 20 years old.
So in the United States, unless you have signed it away, you own the mineral rights on your land.
And so Argentina already has the second most successful shale industry in the world.","Hey everybody, Peter Zeihan here. Coming to you from Colorado. Today we’re taking a question from our Patreon page, specifically from one of our friends down in Australia, wondering if it would be possible for Australia to recreate the sort of energy complex that the United States has, courtesy of the shale revolution. The United States is now just a gross over producer of both oil and natural gas.

It’s driven down energy costs in the country, especially electricity costs, which are now among the lowest in the world. And it’s generated a robust processing and manufacturing system with downstream work and a significant export industry, Australia having a smaller population, but almost as much land could they do it? I don’t want to say no, but there’s some things you have to keep in mind.

Number one, geology is just the first step. So in order to have a shale industry, you have to have a lot of sedimentary layers that are petroleum bearing that just the right age to generate oil, natural gas. And the United States has that because in the past, the North American continent, especially our part of it, has had a series of shallow seas.

And then geology would change, and then you’d get another shallow sea and you basically got these stacked layers so you can drill down and hit multiple petroleum producing zones. In fact, in some places in West Texas, you can have upwards of 20 layers that you can all access from one vertical. Now with shale technology, you go down it until you hit that layer and then you go horizontally.

And that brings us to the second thing. You need water. The way shale works is you make this suspension of water and sand, and that is pumped into the lateral through a series of holes that basically crack the, rock open and release the petroleum. And then back pressure pushes all the liquid out and eventually oil and natural gas comes to the surface.

Don’t have to pump the stuff, but you have to have the water to do it. And part of that folds into the third issue, which is proximity. You have to have relative proximity for your oil and natural gas production. Two population centers are places that can take the stuff for processing. And in this this the United States is pretty good.

We have shale zones in Texas, which of course can get pumped to corpus Christi in Houston. And the rest we’ve got some in Colorado which benefit the Denver area. We’ve got some in Ohio which can be pumped into the Northeast and Pennsylvania. Same thing. Australia’s problem is that most of the geology that looks promising is in the outback.

So not only is it a long ways away from any potential population centers, you’re in the middle of a literal desert, so the water access is more difficult. You can access groundwater that’s done in the United States, too. But all of these things incrementally raise the cost of development. Let’s see what else. Regulatory structure. This is one where a lot of countries, trip up shale wells, as a rule, generate somewhere from the hundreds of barrels to thousands of barrels a day, which sounds great, but it’s not like the mega wells you’re going to get a place like, say, Saudi Arabia.

So you’re going to have more of them and they’re more involved from a technical point of view for production. So you have to have a more advanced educational system to generate that sort of workforce. And the United States really does stand out among the world when it comes to petroleum engineers, because we’ve been doing it for so long.

The shale revolution at this point is about 20 years old. In the United States. Our first oil deposits were back in the mid 1800s. So this is something that we’ve been going and going and going. It’s not that the Australians don’t have that, but most of what the Australians have been doing for energy production in the last 30 years has been offshore, where they tap foreign labor almost as much as local labor.

So there’s there’s a labor crunch there. In addition, if you live in Houston, you can work in West Texas. If you live in Sydney or Brisbane, you’re probably not going to be working on the northwest shelf. It’s just too far. So linking these together, and then on the regulatory side, you have to be able to do things on the fly very, very quickly and have a regulatory structure.

That’s okay with that. So in Texas, the Texas Railroad Commission, which is the one that regulates the space issues, permits 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. They drill on Sundays, they drill on Christmas. And if you don’t have an institution set up to handle that, everything else gets pushed back. This is one of the reasons why the shale attempt in Poland just didn’t work out, because the poles tried to work European hours and it just didn’t fly.

The geology wasn’t as good either. But the most important thing, the single most important thing is landowners have to have an interest in the industry. So in the United States, unless you have signed it away, you own the mineral rights on your land. So if a petroleum company comes and wants to drill in your land, you get a chunk of the proceeds.

We’re the only country in the world that does it that way. So when the United Kingdom tried to kick in the shale that ten years ago, they discovered huge amounts of local opposition because the companies would take all of the money, and that would be that the locals had to deal with the noise and the traffic and all the rest, and they saw absolutely no benefit.

Australia is kind of in that camp. So if, if, if this is going to happen, it’s going to take a lot more money and put a lot of pressure on the labor force and require a regulatory and maybe even a legal overhaul of property rights in Australia in order to generate the sort of outcome that you might want to see.

There are three countries, however, that are worth keeping an eye on when it comes to shale that are closer than Australia to achieving something like the United States. The first, ironically, is Argentina. They already have preexisting infrastructure in a place called vacuum worth a dead cow fields which are very close to populated Argentina, including Buenos Aires. The socialist governments of the past set a price floor.

So anyone going to invest knows how much they’re going to get out. So even though the property law structures are weird and it’s Argentina. So if they’re very weird, if you know the rules of the game on the day that you start, you can get some projects going. And so Argentina already has the second most successful shale industry in the world.

The other two to watch are Mexico and Canada. both have a shale fields that in many ways are extensions of the American geography, especially northern Mexico. The weird thing about Canada in Mexico, though, is their closest population centers for most considerations around the American side of the border. So if we’re going to ever see a successful shale industry in those two countries, it will be because they’re accessing American infrastructure, population structure, processing infrastructure and basically linking into a greater North American energy grid.

Doesn’t mean it can’t happen, but if you’re in Ottawa or Mexico City developing a local energy sector to serve another country, let’s just call that a bit of a political complication.",https://zeihan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/oil-rona-header.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 01:58:25.108388

Not enough chargers have been built and the ones that do exist don’t work for all vehicles. Tesla has built the most substantial charging network and finally Stellantis has agreed to switch to the Tesla North American Charging System for some of its battery electric vehicles. That means starting in 2026, vehicles like the 2026 Dodge Charger Daytona and the 2026 Jeep Recon will be built with the NACS plugs. Jeep, Dodge and Chrysler have electrified vehicles that can be plugged in to charge. Ram is working on an extended range hybrid pickup.

The Tesla Plug Change Will be Phased in Gradually

Apparently, the adoption of the North American Charging System (NACS) for select Stellantis battery-electric vehicles will happen in phases. Starting in early 2026, in North America, existing BEVs, such as the Jeep Wagoneer S and Dodge Charger Daytona will be equipped to use the Tesla Supercharger network. Eventually the 2026 Jeep Recon and other future products will also be able to use the NACS network. There will be more details about adapter information for current Stellantis BEV models released in the future.

The change in charging plugs will start in North America in 2026. In 2027, vehicles in Japan and South Korea will be added to the NACS network. There are currently 28,000 Tesla superchargers in North America, Japan and South Korea.

Reluctance to Buy Electric Vehicles

Range anxiety and concerns about finding adequate charging facilities are two of the main reasons that people are reluctant to buy electric vehicles. All of the automakers have struggled with convincing customers that they will be able to charge vehicles quickly. Most complaints center around poor charging infrastructure, especially in rural or remote areas. Jeep has financed installing chargers at trailheads but still the outlets are few and far between. Often, when drivers do find charging facilities, they have been vandalized.

The collaboration between Stellantis and Tesla will certainly boost customer confidence in public charging. By unlocking broader access to charging infrastructure, Stellantis gives customers more choice, more coverage and more control over how, where and when they power their EVs.

New Mexico received the most of any state with more than $2.7 billion in payments.

The disbursements support a wide range of initiatives, including public infrastructure, education, emergency services, conservation and reclamation projects, and historic preservation. This year’s total represents the fifth-largest disbursement since 1982.

The Donald J. Trump administration has focused on combating inflation and reducing energy costs. These lower prices have helped keep more money in the pockets of American consumers while still providing critical funding to states, tribes and federal programs through ONRR’s disbursements. This year’s disbursements decreased from the previous year largely due to the drop in commodity prices.

ONRR’s disbursements were aided by the Trump administration’s priorities under Executive Order 14154, Unleashing American Energy, which directs federal agencies to remove regulatory barriers and encourage responsible energy development on public lands. Additionally, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which reduced the cost of doing business on public lands, making oil and gas development more economically attractive to industry, spurred domestic energy production while lowering commodity prices.

Fiscal year 2025 Disbursement Highlights:

$5.01 billion to the U.S. Treasury

$4.07 billion to 34 states

$2.98 billion to the Reclamation Fund

$1.05 billion to the Land and Water Conservation Fund

$1.00 billion to Tribes and individual Indian mineral owners

$350 million to federal agencies

$150 million to the Historic Preservation Fund

The $4.07 billion in state disbursements reflects revenue from mineral and energy production on federal lands within the states’ borders and offshore tracts in federal waters adjacent to states’ shores.

The states receiving the highest disbursements based on those activities are:

New Mexico

$2.76 billion

Wyoming

$544.87 million

Louisiana

$162.42 million

North Dakota

$114.95 million

Texas

Mississippi

$52.34 million

Alabama

$51.73 million

California

$39.12 million

Alaska

The revenue disbursed to 33 federally recognized tribes and approximately 31,000 individual Indian mineral owners represent 100% of the revenues received for energy and mineral production activities on Indian lands. Tribes use these revenues to develop infrastructure, provide health care and education, and support other critical community development programs, such as senior centers, public safety projects and youth initiatives.

Since 1982, the Department has disbursed over $402 billion in mineral leasing revenues.

MPLX Investment Narrative Recap

MPLX shareholders must believe in the enduring demand for U.S. energy infrastructure and the company's ability to capitalize on export growth from key regions like Houston and the Permian Basin. The recent partnership with Oneok to develop a US$1.75 billion Texas City export terminal expands MPLX’s export capacity, but does not meaningfully reduce near-term risks tied to market or regulatory headwinds that can impact return on new investments.

Among recent announcements, the 12.5% increase in MPLX’s quarterly dividend stands out. A strengthened distribution underscores management’s confidence in cash flow durability, an important point, given the sizable capital commitments like the new Houston project that will test MPLX’s ability to deliver long-term returns and sustain payout growth.

In contrast, investors should also keep a close eye on how expanding capital expenditures might magnify balance sheet and refinancing risks if...

Recently, Targa Resources, a market leader of midstream services in the United States, outlined its plans to develop a 500-mile “Speedway” NGL pipeline that will link the Permian to Mont Belvieu, Texas. The company has been contemplating measures to increase its foothold in the Permian and now has plans to construct the astonishingly long NGL pipeline, along with several other projects.

The 500-mile Natural Gas Liquids pipeline exemplifies the company’s ambitions for the US market

Targa Resources has become one of the largest independent infrastructure companies in North America and boasts a diversified portfolio of significant domestic infrastructure assets that have positioned the United States as the world’s go-to destination for gas supply.

The reality of the impact of sanctions on Russian energy has led the US to become the top destination for the world’s gas and NGL buyers, all frantically searching for a non-Russian energy supplier. The new “cold war” of energy resources between the US and Russia has led many nations that formerly did business with Moscow to enter into purchasing agreements with the US to buy their substantial gas supply.

Targa Resources’ Speedway NGL Pipeline will become the backbone of the US gas sector

The company has noted that the plan is to construct a 30-inch pipeline and associated infrastructure with a start-up capacity of 500,000 barrels per day, which could be doubled to 1 million barrels per day if needed. The expected price tag to build the Speedway NGL Pipeline is hovering around $1.6 billion and is expected to begin service in the third quarter of 2027.

The Speedway NGL pipeline is not the only project being planned by Targa Resources

The firm has confirmed its plan to construct the Yeti processing plant, which will boast a 275 million cubic feet per day capacity that will serve the firm’s growth on the Permian Delaware system. Targa is currently constructing five gas processing plants that will come online over the next by 2027, and has outlined plans to build an additional 35-mile natural gas pipeline that will enhance the company’s connectivity to the Permian operations.

Furthermore, Targa is planning a 55-mile conversion of an existing pipeline into natural gas service, targeting the expansion of its extensive energy infrastructure to accommodate an expected increase in gas demand around the United States and the world. However, some industry analysts have cautioned that the new pipeline could result in substantial spare capacity out of the Permian Basin.

“If Targa sustains the approximate 140,000-barrel-per-day annual NGL growth it achieved during the Grand Prix-Daytona buildout, Speedway’s initial 500,000-barrel-per-day capacity could be filled within about two years after startup. Speedway provides much-needed headroom, though Targa must carefully coordinate fractionation and LPG export expansions to avoid system bottlenecks.” – Julian Renton and Jaxson Fryer of East Daley Analytics

As several energy-rich nations outline their plans to invest heavily in the midstream sector over the coming years, Targa is betting on its vast Permian infrastructure to lead the US into a new era.

So, while the data suggests electric cars depreciate at a faster rate, it's important to explore other avenues to verify the claim.
This steep drop-off in value was seen clear as day recently when a 2021 Tesla Model Y Long Range sold for less than half of its original MSRP, despite being fairly well presented.
While Tesla models do not feature on the list, among the worst performers are models like the Nissan Leaf, Wrangler 4xe, Volkswagen ID.4, Subaru Solterra, and Toyota bZ4x.
There are many reasons why Tesla models might drop value quickly, from over saturation in the market to the CEO's controversial political viewpoints, but the truth is the same results can be seen across the entire EV market.","Electric cars are nothing new. Not even in the sense that, yes technically, electric vehicles have been around for over a century, but even in the mainstream automotive world, EVs have been regular sights on the road now for over a decade. The infrastructure has come on leaps and bounds: they can be charged in minutes, battery packs don't degrade as badly as the naysayers feared they would, and they are even getting more affordable to buy, too.

However, for some reason, they still depreciate far quicker than their gas-powered counterparts. EVs are fairly attractive as a new buy for many of us, but secondhand models are just not that desirable, it would seem. According to Thunder Said Energy, while ICE cars tend to depreciate on average by $0.11 per mile covered, EVs come in at $0.27 per mile, demonstrating just how wide the gulf is. There are variables that could affect the value of this data, for example, over the past few years, many EVs will have been purchased with a $7,500 reduction, courtesy of the now-canceled federal tax credits. This, effectively, immediately places $7,500 worth of depreciation onto qualifying vehicles, as surely no one would pay more for a used model.

This needs to be taken into account when looking at electric vs. gas in terms of depreciation; it's important to compare the actual price paid, and not just the MSRP listed prior to incentives. With that being said, we can't rely solely on depreciation reports, as it's unclear whether or not the effective $7,500 reduction has been factored into the calculations. So, while the data suggests electric cars depreciate at a faster rate, it's important to explore other avenues to verify the claim.

It's true that Tesla resale values aren't what they used to be. This might be down to their huge popularity; a large supply on the used market might be outpacing demand. Other factors are always at play too, such as Tesla CEO Elon Musk's political controversies, and how the brand fares in relation to new competition, such as Rivian and Lucid. This steep drop-off in value was seen clear as day recently when a 2021 Tesla Model Y Long Range sold for less than half of its original MSRP, despite being fairly well presented.

Back in 2021, the Tesla cost its owner $54,190, and came in a smart specification, with a smart Satin Dark Gray wrap, 20-inch Induction wheels, and a black leather interior. If we factor in a $7,500 reduction, courtesy of the federal tax credits, that gives us a revised purchase price of $46,690. However, this attractive spec and reasonable odometer reading of just 48,500 miles did little to excite buyers when it came up for auction, with the hammer falling at a miserable $24,888. CarEdge's depreciation calculator suggests this is quite typical of the model, suggesting that a Model Y will drop 57% of its value after four years on the road and 48,000 miles. Judging by this estimate, the auction seller actually did quite well, losing roughly 47% of the original purchase price, taking into account a likely $7,500 reduction on the MSRP when new.

In addition, CarEdge has ranked 185 cars according to how well, or how poorly, they retain value. While Tesla models do not feature on the list, among the worst performers are models like the Nissan Leaf, Wrangler 4xe, Volkswagen ID.4, Subaru Solterra, and Toyota bZ4x.

The Wrangler 4xe — one of which we test drove in 2024 — is an interesting model to highlight, as of course, there is a near-identical gas-powered model with which we can compare in terms of depreciation. Once again relying on data sourced from CarEdge, we see that the gas-powered Wrangler typically can be expected to shed 29% of its value in the first five years of ownership. This is based upon a new price of $48,226 and 13,500 miles being covered each year, and it translates to a total loss of $14,116.

By way of comparison, the Wrangler 4xe is projected to drop a staggering 59% of its value over those same years and miles. The starting price given by CarEdge is higher, at $61,887, to reflect the model's real-world higher starting price. As such, the amount lost is also considerably more, at $36,235. Even if we strip the qualified amount of EV tax credits from that figure, and factor in cheaper running and maintenance costs, the traditionally motivated Wrangler still looks to be the financially safer bet after five years on the road.

Similar comparisons can be made elsewhere, and comparing Toyota's bZ4X and RAV4 brings similar results, as does pitting Subaru's Crosstrek against the Solterra. There are many reasons why Tesla models might drop value quickly, from over saturation in the market to the CEO's controversial political viewpoints, but the truth is the same results can be seen across the entire EV market.",https://www.slashgear.com/img/gallery/tesla-isnt-alone-most-electric-cars-lose-value-faster-than-you-might-think/l-intro-1764154569.jpg,N,,2025-11-29 19:58:11.882443

The statement covered headline issues such as support for electric vehicles, changes to motoring taxation and fresh commitments on energy security and efficiency.
For many on the left, the sustainability content will likely feel underpowered, especially given the scale of the climate challenge.
""One of the greatest drivers of the rising cost of living is the cost of energy prices,"" Reeves told the Commons.
""The cause of high energy bills must be tackled at source and so we are investing in energy security in nuclear and renewable energy, and in insulation through our Warm Homes Plan.""","The UK's Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves has set out the Labour government’s second Autumn Budget since taking office in 2024, outlining how the UK intends to tax and spend in 2026 and the years that follow.

The statement covered headline issues such as support for electric vehicles, changes to motoring taxation and fresh commitments on energy security and efficiency.

The fiscal package had been trailed as a pivotal moment for Reeves and Prime Minister Keir Starmer, with the administration seeing pressure from both the Greens and Reform as discontent grows across the political spectrum.

With this backdrop, the Chancellor opted for a relatively cautious stance, keeping income tax and national insurance rates unchanged in a bid to avoid provoking either left or right.

“I’ve made my choices: not reckless borrowing, not dangerous cuts, but stability for our economy, security for our public finances and security for family finances too,” she said. “Those are the Labour choices.”

Overall, the Budget contained fewer big-ticket spending pledges than some recent predecessors, though there were notable signals on how the UK will support renewable power, EV charging and energy-efficiency schemes over the next five years.

For many on the left, the sustainability content will likely feel underpowered, especially given the scale of the climate challenge. Reeves also used her speech to caution against what she characterised as overreach in pursuit of net-zero, taking aim at the Green Party in the process.

“The leader of the Green Party is a keen hypnotherapist and he believes he can achieve remarkable things using only the power of his mind,” Reeves said.

“Unfortunately, the only things getting bigger under his approach would be the deficit and the rate of inflation.”

A new pay-per-mile tax for EV drivers

One of the most eye-catching measures for the energy and transport sectors is a new mileage-based levy on battery electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles, designed to narrow the gap with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs).

Under the plans, the Electric Vehicle Excise Duty will charge EV owners per mile driven, rather than relying solely on conventional vehicle excise duty bands.

""Because all cars contribute to the wear and tear on our roads,” she said, “I will ensure that drivers are taxed according to how much they drive and not just by the type of car they own by introducing the EV Excise Duty on electric cars.”

The charge is expected to be set at around £0.03 per mile for fully electric models and £0.015 per mile for plug-in hybrids, starting in April 2028 and projected to generate about US$1.8bn by the 2029-2030 fiscal year.

The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has indicated that this will offset roughly a quarter of the 0.6% of GDP that would otherwise be lost from declining fuel duty receipts as the fleet electrifies.

While still only around half of the effective rate faced by petrol and diesel drivers, the move has already prompted debate over its impact on the EV transition.

“Today’s announcement is a clear signal that the UK is serious about an all-electric future,” says Mark Caskey, MD of Projects at Mitie.

“However, introducing a pay-per-mile charge for EVs, on top of existing road taxes, sends a mixed message. Businesses need certainty to invest in cleaner fleets, not policies that could stall momentum and threaten jobs in UK manufacturing.”

Britain's nuclear future

On the power system, the Budget confirms temporary funding for the renewables obligation mechanism, with spending of US$3.8bn pencilled in for the coming year and an average outlay of US$2.6bn in both 2027-28 and 2028-29.

This support is due to be wound down and removed entirely by 2029-30, signalling an eventual transition away from this particular subsidy regime.

""One of the greatest drivers of the rising cost of living is the cost of energy prices,"" Reeves told the Commons.

""The cause of high energy bills must be tackled at source and so we are investing in energy security in nuclear and renewable energy, and in insulation through our Warm Homes Plan.""

As part of this, Reeves highlighted plans to team up with Rolls-Royce to build three small modular reactors in Wales at the Wylfa site, a move intended to anchor a new generation of nuclear capacity in the UK.

The Warm Homes Plan will channel funding towards lower-income households, helping them upgrade insulation and low-carbon heating, including through an expanded Boiler Upgrade Scheme and streamlined planning rules for heat pump installations.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/b58015f2c9a8b69086119c3e93ff0dad:acbb713b6edbadb634167b08996a56b7/rachel-reeves-the-uk-s-chancellor-of-the-exchequer-today-revealed-the-government-s-budget.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-11-29 23:59:08.113830

There must have been some mistake. A wrecking crew showed up almost without notice, rumbling in the direction of the East Wing. I hope no one was inside when, unannounced, the crane stood astride the structure and embarked on its demolition directive.

It must have come as a surprise, even to the White House staff, since President Trump had assured everyone that the East Wing would be spared in his plan for the 90,000-square-foot ballroom he envisioned.

As with so many other assurances from him, Trump ignored his promise, and authorized the complete destruction of the east facade of the People’s House. The garish, gold-plated

monument that will replace the east entryway often used by guests and access to the headquarters of our first ladies aligns perfectly with the tasteless, gold-festooned Oval Office, reminiscent of tsarist vulgarity.

What the construction blueprint ought to have envisioned was an urgently needed upgrade to the septic system that serves the presidential suite. Remember the time the current occupant touted his agenda to “drain the swamp.” Instead, he has created a cesspool of corruption that dwarfs the misdeeds of any prior occupant.

The public reaction to the odor demands a thorough sanitizing to rid the residence of the stench.

Here is what a filter of the detritus would encounter:

Acceptance of a $400 million (before retrofitting) jetliner from a foreign government that will land at the Trump library, such as it will be.

A pardon for the world’s best known and wealthiest crypto felon, whose business

dealings with the Trump boys will surely flourish.

A crypto business deal with the UAE worth $2 billion, which will benefit the boys,

the son-in-law and the pal, Steve Witkoff.

This doesn’t even account for the coins, Bibles, guitars, boots and, yes, even the Constitution, merch that could clog any heavy-duty filter.

All of this can be cataloged as unprecedented greed by an American president. It mirrors the behavior of Trump’s role model, Vladimir Putin: using power to line the pockets of family and oligarchs, in return for unconditional loyalty.

If this denigration of the office of president were the only waste to be encountered by a

White House septic system, it would overwhelm it. But, there is so much more.

Let’s recall Trump’s 2023 Rose Garden promise to be “the most transparent president ever.” The utter hypocrisy of that assurance is evident in his refusal to release visitor logs and tax returns (are they still under audit?), his restricting media access to those friendly to his administration and perhaps most tellingly, to his pressuring anyone he can not to release the Epstein files.

Why would he not support transparency, unless there was something to hide? Those emails released by the House Oversight Committee confirm, at the very least, a close relationship between these men, which, given Epstein’s nefarious activities, carries its own odor. The stench is so palpable that even MAGA supporters want to know the source.

That we are even seeking to determine if our president was aware of the sex trafficking operation of a person with whom he spent considerable time so demeans our country that it will take a long time to recover. To witness the complicity of Republican lawmakers attempting to suppress the information concealed in FBI and DOJ files only adds to the sordid story unfolding before our eyes.

As some defectors for whom the White House conduct is too revolting come out of their closet, we can only hope that some measure of accountability will result. It’s a long shot if we think about how successful Trump has been in intimidating his party’s senators.

And, even if they were to display uncommon bravery and vote to release the Epstein files, rest assured a veto awaits, relying, in all likelihood, on the claim that an ongoing investigation (which Trump initiated against Democratic notables using his law firm, the DOJ) prevents the release.

The sleaze is unending. When this president finally exits the White House (if there still is one), the Environmental Protection Agency should outfit the clean-up crew with hazmat suits for their own protection.

However, due to a multitude of challenges standing in the way of a complete overhaul, U.S. energy infrastructure remains highly unprepared for severe weather events.
Now, another threat is adding to fears of winter blackouts – data centres.
During a severe winter storm, Texas’ power demand could rise to as much as 85.3 GW.
This demonstrates just how dramatically the tech sector is changing the landscape of power demand through data centre development.","The energy infrastructure in the United States has failed repeatedly in instances of severe weather, due to years of underinvestment and the failure of utilities to work together to strengthen larger networks. During winter storms and wildfires, a wide range of energy infrastructure has been known to fail due to the lack of preparedness by utilities and state governments. Going into the winter months, there are fears over more potential network failures across various parts of the U.S.

Texas, California, and several other states face annual power outages due to severe weather events, from winter storms to heatwaves. In February 2021, Storm Uri brought plunging temperatures to the state of Texas and left millions of people without electricity, heat, or running water, as much of the infrastructure froze. These outages turned off electricity in various parts of Texas, including parts of the natural gas network that are electrically operated, such as pumps and antifreeze injection systems. This led to the shutdown of several power plants.

During the storm, as demand increased for heating, Texas grid operator ERCOT ordered 20 GW of rolling blackouts to prevent a total system collapse, according to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). It was the “largest manually controlled load shedding event in U.S. history,” with 4.5 million people losing power for several days, stated a FERC report.

The U.S. energy network is highly fragmented, with different state governments each managing parts of the grid, and a multitude of utilities responsible for different infrastructure. The fractured nature of the system makes it extremely hard to fix. For example, investment made in the transmission lines of one state may not be replicated by the neighbouring state, meaning that the network in part of a region may be more resilient than another.

In 2021, the Biden administration introduced the $2 trillion Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, aimed at upgrading U.S. infrastructure. The plan earmarked $100 billion in financing to update and modernise the electric grid to make it more reliable and resilient. However, due to a multitude of challenges standing in the way of a complete overhaul, U.S. energy infrastructure remains highly unprepared for severe weather events.

Now, another threat is adding to fears of winter blackouts – data centres. There has been a rapid rollout of data centres across the U.S. in recent years, as tech companies invest heavily in the infrastructure needed to power advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence. This has driven up energy demand in several states, particularly in Texas. The concern now is that this will increase the risk of energy shortages, which could result in power cuts during freezing temperatures.

Requests for new data centres are on the rise in Texas, thanks to its growing renewable energy capacity and natural gas resources. In recent years, Houston has become known by many as the Silicon Valley of energy, for its strong reputation for energy production, growing cleantech sector, and welcoming business environment. This has helped attract significant investment to the state from tech companies looking to expand operations.

The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) warned in November that the 24/7 energy demand of data centres will make it increasingly difficult to maintain sufficient electricity supply during times of high demand, such as if the temperature drops to an extreme low.

During a severe winter storm, Texas’ power demand could rise to as much as 85.3 GW. While the state’s 92.6 GW electricity capacity would normally be enough to power this demand, the available power could decrease to roughly 69.7 GW during a severe weather event, meaning a deficit of over 15 GW.

In a recent analysis, NERC stated, “Strong load growth from new data centres and other large industrial end users is driving higher winter electricity demand forecasts and contributing to continued risk of supply shortfalls.” It went on to say that while Texas will experience elevated risk during extreme winter weather, but the grid will remain stable during normal peak demand.

Over 120 GW of projects have requested to be connected to the Texas grid, marking a 170 percent increase since January requests. Approximately 73 percent of these projects are data centres, according to ERCOT. If all these data centres are built, it would equate to the average annual power consumption of almost 154 million homes. However, experts believe that it is unlikely for the massive project pipeline to be developed in its entirety, as there is simply not enough power to serve it.

Years of underinvestment in the U.S. grid, a lack of preparedness from utilities, and the rise in demand for data centres could lead to a power deficit if Texas, or another state, is hit by severe weather this winter. This demonstrates just how dramatically the tech sector is changing the landscape of power demand through data centre development. It also implies the need for stronger regulations to ensure that the electricity supply is sufficient and stable enough to meet demand before approving new projects.

But a new analysis from the Pew Research Center shows that behind the innovation is a massive, and growing, strain on the country’s energy and water systems. And for everyday Americans, that could mean higher bills and new long-term environmental challenges.

AI’s Power Appetite Is Exploding

Pew’s review of federal and international data shows U.S. data centers used 183 terawatt-hours of electricity in 2024, about 4% of all electricity used nationwide, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). That’s roughly equal to the entire annual electricity use of Pakistan.

The biggest driver? Hyperscale facilities built specifically for AI models.

According to Pew and the IEA, a typical AI-optimized hyperscale center uses as much electricity as 100,000 homes a year. Newer mega-facilities could use 20 times more once they go online.

In major hubs, especially Northern Virginia, clusters of these centers now consume more than a quarter of the state’s total electricity supply, the Electric Power Research Institute reports.

The Ripple Effect: Rising Bills and Stressed Grids

The higher the power demand, the more utilities must upgrade the grid, and those costs don’t disappear.

In the PJM electricity market (Illinois to North Carolina), data center growth added $9.3 billion in capacity costs for 2025–26, per Pew’s analysis of PJM data. The result:

+ $18/month in western Maryland

+ $16/month in Ohio homes

Looking ahead, Carnegie Mellon University estimates U.S. electricity bills could rise 8% by 2030 just from data centers and crypto mining alone, with even steeper hikes in the most data-center-dense regions.

Water Use: The Quiet Problem No One Is Ready For

Electricity isn’t the only resource being pushed to the limit.

Pew cites federal figures showing U.S. data centers used 17 billion gallons of water in 2023, mostly to cool energy-intensive AI chips at hyperscale sites. And by 2028, hyperscale centers alone could be consuming 16 to 33 billion gallons annually — roughly the yearly use of a mid-sized U.S. city. Cooling demands vary by season and by facility design, but researchers say the overall trend is clear: AI growth means water demand is climbing fast.

Americans Are Unsure What to Make of AI’s Environmental Impact

Pew’s August 2024 survey suggests the public hasn’t formed a consensus:

25% believe AI will harm the environment

20% believe it will help

25% think it’ll be a mix

30% aren’t sure

Yet in recent months, we’ve watched two long-standing local restaurants — The Lawrenceville Drive-In, a fixture in our community for decades, and Hardee’s — close their doors. These losses should be a wake-up call for all of us.

The truth is simple: when we choose to shop or eat across the river instead of right here at home, our local businesses struggle to survive. Dollars spent in Vincennes support their economy, their workers, and their tax base — not ours. Meanwhile, our own businesses, owned and staffed by our neighbors, face an uphill battle just to keep the doors open. If more of our daily spending had stayed local, it’s entirely possible these two restaurants could still be open today.

Supporting local businesses isn’t just sentimental — it’s smart economic strategy. Money spent in Lawrenceville circulates within Lawrenceville. It helps pay local employees, fund local services, and build the foundation needed to attract new businesses and restaurants. When potential investors see a community that actively supports its businesses, they’re more likely to bring new opportunities here.

But the business climate isn’t only shaped by shopping habits. Serious environmental violations — like the ones recently committed by our wastewater treatment plant — also have a direct impact on economic growth. Companies considering Lawrenceville look closely at infrastructure, regulatory compliance, and environmental safety. When our WWTP exceeds permitted discharge limits and risks polluting our river, it doesn’t just harm wildlife — it signals to prospective businesses that our city may not be prepared to support long-term, sustainable development. No business wants to invest in a community facing ongoing environmental compliance issues.

City leadership must take this seriously. Along with simplifying processes and improving communication, we need consistent accountability and transparent operation of essential services. A healthy business environment starts with responsible management of the city’s core infrastructure.

A thriving local economy doesn’t happen by accident. It happens when a community decides that supporting its own — and maintaining the standards that attract new investment — is a priority. Lawrenceville deserves that level of commitment from its leaders and its citizens.

Where federal funding has failed, the plan for those working in Indian Country energy is to step in and knit together what projects they can, however they can.","Cody Two-Bears spent more than $1 million training Native workers for clean energy jobs. Then the jobs disappeared.

The federal Solar for All program that funded his nonprofit, Indigenized Energy, was terminated in August as part of the Trump administration’s broader pullback from renewable energy. Indigenized Energy won’t be reimbursed. The workers he trained are now looking for positions that no longer exist.

It’s the kind of whiplash I keep hearing about from tribal energy leaders across Indian Country. Federal funding for tribal energy surged under the Biden administration, then vanished under the Trump administration — and tribes that built plans around that money are scrambling to find alternatives.

The scale of what’s been cut is staggering. The Environmental Protection Agency has frozen or outright terminated the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund in its entirety, $2 billion of which was aimed squarely at Indian Country. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act laid out a quick sunsetting of game-changing tax credits that will now prove difficult for many tribes to access. In October, the Department of Energy terminated $8 billion in energy projects across the country, including multiple projects tied directly to or closely benefitting tribal nations.

Native energy advocates worried what that policy shift might mean, but expressed optimism that the most important pieces of Biden-era policy would remain in place. They didn’t. As a Republican-led Congress signed onto Trump’s policies mostly wholesale, funding evaporated even faster than expected, kneecapping clean energy’s momentum.

In my reporting, I’ve heard a lot of tribal energy experts say basically the same thing: If Washington won't fund it, Indian Country will find another way.

“The Big Beautiful Bill really took the wind out of our sails in terms of rewriting the energy narrative,” Clara Pratte, executive director and co-founder of energy developer Navajo Power, said during a recent webinar hosted by Clean Energy for America. “Now, as practitioners, one of the things we’re beholden to is figuring out where we find that capital, where we continue the good work.”

Pratte’s answer was specific: “We’re looking at private capital, philanthropy and tribal-to-tribal partnerships,” she said. “If federal dollars aren’t reliable, then we have to make sure our projects are bankable in other ways. That’s how we keep moving.”

Claudio Clini, a policy analyst with energy advocacy nonprofit Alliance for Tribal Clean Energy, said his organization planned to “demystify” Indian Country for potential investors, working to clarify sovereignty and land law, and to close culture gaps.

“If they understand sovereignty and history, they’ll be more comfortable bringing capital into Indian Country,” Clini said.

In the meantime, Two-Bears said, tribes should plan to turn toward banks and private financing to keep projects afloat where nonprofit or foundational dollars can’t quite reach.

“Tribes need to demonstrate that we can build projects that can be repaid. We’ve got to make these attractive to banks and other people that loan the money,” Two-Bears said. “We have to show that we can take those loans and pay those loans back, then keep these projects alive.”

It's a familiar pattern. In my reporting on tribal broadband and workforce development, I've seen tribes building internal capacity specifically to reduce dependence on federal dollars — control what you can, because Washington's priorities change every election.

Where federal funding has failed, the plan for those working in Indian Country energy is to step in and knit together what projects they can, however they can.

The team of volunteers are a full house for the chamber of commerce.” Chamber dinners are about celebrating successes and recognizing individuals and organizations for the work they do in the community.
“Former Wellsburg chamber President Dan Otto even passed along a new set of scissors to commemorate our first ribbon-cutting as a chamber of commerce,” he said.
Emily Byers, president of the Jefferson County Chamber of Commerce, and Brenda Mull, president of the Weirton Area Chamber of Commerce, both were at the dinner.
“You should be proud of your chamber of commerce,” Fithyan added.","Running a chamber of commerce is never an easy assignment, and it can get even more complicated when the organization has been built through the merger of two longtime groups.

When you consider the accomplishments of the Brooke County Area Chamber of Commerce, however, you have to say that the organization has gotten off to a pretty good start.

“This evening, we are all seated at the same table — a table of opportunity connection and growth,” said Sandy Kemp. “It’s wonderful to see so many familiar faces, and so many new ones at our table tonight.”

Kemp, the director of the Brooke County Senior Center, was speaking as the first vice president of the Brooke chamber, and her words were delivered Nov. 12 as part of the opening remarks at the organization’s recognition dinner. She stressed that the chamber’s core was strengthening business connections and bringing people together.

“This past year, the merger of the Wellsburg and Follansbee chambers has been a winning combination,” Kemp said to the 200-or-so who attended the dinner at the St. Francis Center in Follansbee.

Her words were in keeping with the theme of the evening: Place Your Bets on Success: Bet on the Chamber. They also helped to guide President Eric Fithyan.

“Tonight, we celebrate our first year as a merged chamber,” Fithyan explained. “I think it’s safe to say that we’ve hit the jackpot. The team of volunteers are a full house for the chamber of commerce.”

Chamber dinners are about celebrating successes and recognizing individuals and organizations for the work they do in the community. This year’s honorees — A Child’s Place C.A.S.A., the nonprofit organization of the year; Suzanne Davidson, the recipient of the lifetime achievement award; Tony Viola, the young professional of the year; Two Antique Geeks, the business of the year; and Samantha Walters, the citizen of the year — certainly fell into that category.

But, as Fihyan said, the biggest milestone of the year was the merger of the Wellsburg and Follansbee chambers that created the new group.

“What started as months of conversations between two organizations become a reality this year,” he said. “Both groups placed trust in me to serve as president for two years to help guide the transition into a unified chamber of commerce.”

That transition did not come without challenges.

“As with many changes, some members of our board of directors retired, and others decided that the decision was not for them,” Fithyan added. “But those who stayed came together with dedication and a vision, joined by many members. We came together to create something stronger, something better — a vibrant, united organization.”

Fithyan said a rotating board structure will hope to ensure that the organization always has fresh board members who will bring new perspectives and fresh ideas.

While the organization is moving forward, Fithyan said, it’s important that it does not lose touch with the past.

“Former Wellsburg chamber President Dan Otto even passed along a new set of scissors to commemorate our first ribbon-cutting as a chamber of commerce,” he said.

Those scissors have handles that are orange and blue.

“Our colors tell our story — the orange represents Wellsburg High School and the Orange Knights, and the blue is for the Follansbee Blue Wave. We’re deep in history, but we’re still one chamber of commerce,” Fithyan said.

“They represent who we are now, a new organization built on rich traditions as we share one motto of working together.”

Fithyan added that the chamber ribbon-cuttings during the past year had welcomed six new businesses to the area.

Collaboration, he explained, is important to everything the chamber does. That includes partnering with the other chambers of commerce in our region. Emily Byers, president of the Jefferson County Chamber of Commerce, and Brenda Mull, president of the Weirton Area Chamber of Commerce, both were at the dinner.

It also includes working with volunteers at community events, from helping at the Mountaineer Food Bank and the Wellsburg Applefest to providing teacher grants and coordinating one of the region’s biggest trunk-or-treat events. Those efforts helped the organization earn a nomination as a finalist in the community involvement category in the Best of the Best awards presented by the Herald-Star and The Weirton Daily Times.

“That’s recognition that reflects every hour of volunteer time and every ounce of dedication to this team,” Fithyan said.

Volunteer work, he explained, is what makes the chamber a success.

“All of this, every event, every partnership, every success was accomplished by an all-volunteer team,” Fithyan added.

That dedication and work have created a solid foundation for the organization.

“You should be proud of your chamber of commerce,” Fithyan added. “You should be proud of your volunteer effort. As your president, I am proud, deeply proud, to serve and to serve Brooke County and our surrounding communities. From Weirton to Beech Bottom, from Bethany to Colliers to Wellsburg and Follansbee, we are a family.”

But a new analysis from the Pew Research Center shows that behind the innovation is a massive, and growing, strain on the country’s energy and water systems. And for everyday Americans, that could mean higher bills and new long-term environmental challenges.

AI’s Power Appetite Is Exploding

Pew’s review of federal and international data shows U.S. data centers used 183 terawatt-hours of electricity in 2024, about 4% of all electricity used nationwide, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). That’s roughly equal to the entire annual electricity use of Pakistan.

The biggest driver? Hyperscale facilities built specifically for AI models.

According to Pew and the IEA, a typical AI-optimized hyperscale center uses as much electricity as 100,000 homes a year. Newer mega-facilities could use 20 times more once they go online.

In major hubs, especially Northern Virginia, clusters of these centers now consume more than a quarter of the state’s total electricity supply, the Electric Power Research Institute reports.

The Ripple Effect: Rising Bills and Stressed Grids

The higher the power demand, the more utilities must upgrade the grid, and those costs don’t disappear.

In the PJM electricity market (Illinois to North Carolina), data center growth added $9.3 billion in capacity costs for 2025–26, per Pew’s analysis of PJM data. The result:

+ $18/month in western Maryland

+ $16/month in Ohio homes

Looking ahead, Carnegie Mellon University estimates U.S. electricity bills could rise 8% by 2030 just from data centers and crypto mining alone, with even steeper hikes in the most data-center-dense regions.

Water Use: The Quiet Problem No One Is Ready For

Electricity isn’t the only resource being pushed to the limit.

Pew cites federal figures showing U.S. data centers used 17 billion gallons of water in 2023, mostly to cool energy-intensive AI chips at hyperscale sites. And by 2028, hyperscale centers alone could be consuming 16 to 33 billion gallons annually — roughly the yearly use of a mid-sized U.S. city. Cooling demands vary by season and by facility design, but researchers say the overall trend is clear: AI growth means water demand is climbing fast.

Americans Are Unsure What to Make of AI’s Environmental Impact

Pew’s August 2024 survey suggests the public hasn’t formed a consensus:

25% believe AI will harm the environment

20% believe it will help

25% think it’ll be a mix

30% aren’t sure

That uncertainty mirrors the reality: the U.S. is witnessing a resource-intensive surge with no clear long-term blueprint yet.",https://abc45.com/resources/media2/16x9/5025/1320/0x292/90/5dc7c502-fcd0-4b76-abf7-f9abfcb15a73-GettyImages2242297318.jpg,N,,2025-11-29 14:08:40.286860

The EU’s Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) and the German Supply Chain Act already require companies to prove human rights and environmental safeguards.
The International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) is developing global assurance standards for ESG disclosures, while buyers of automotive and electronics are demanding supplier-level carbon verification.
Yet SMEs remain critical links in global supply chains.
Companies that embed traceability, carbon accountability, and third-party assurance today won’t just meet tightening rules.","Global supply chains are facing the most profound audit transformation in decades. What began as siloed compliance programs for safety, quality, or sustainability is rapidly converging into integrated, data-driven assurance. By 2026, suppliers will be audited not just on product quality, but on their carbon footprint, human rights practices, and ability to prove end-to-end traceability.

1. Regulation moves from paper to penalties

Across regions, disclosure and due diligence rules are shifting from voluntary to enforceable. The EU’s Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) and the German Supply Chain Act already require companies to prove human rights and environmental safeguards. In the U.S., the SEC’s climate disclosure rules and the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) are raising the bar on transparency. Non-compliance no longer means reputational damage alone — it now carries financial, legal, and market access risks.

2. Traceability-by-design is becoming the new standard

According to McKinsey, 70% of a company’s emissions come from suppliers, most of which remain opaque. To meet Scope 3 reporting requirements, batch-level, machine-readable data will soon be non-negotiable. Blockchain pilots in apparel are already proving the feasibility of immutable chain-of-custody records.

3. Assurance extends beyond ESG reporting

Just as financial statements require independent auditors, sustainability data is moving toward third-party verification. The International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) is developing global assurance standards for ESG disclosures, while buyers of automotive and electronics are demanding supplier-level carbon verification.

4. Technology raises — but doesn’t replace — human judgment

AI and automation will play a pivotal role:

AI-powered analytics can detect anomalies in labor hours or energy use before audits take place.

Automated compliance checks will free auditors to focus on remediation and long-term risk.

Yet cultural dynamics, ethical dilemmas, and stakeholder trust still demand human interpretation.

5. The expanding scope: From EHS to climate, human rights and biodiversity

Traditional environmental, health, and safety (EHS) audits are broadening into multi-criteria assessments. Future audits will verify not only emissions but also water usage, biodiversity impacts, and living-wage compliance. The World Benchmarking Alliance reports that fewer than 20% of major companies can currently demonstrate full supply-chain due diligence, a gap buyers and regulators are determined to close.

What does this mean for suppliers?

Adapting to these rising expectations will not be uniform across the supply chain. Large corporations generally have the resources to invest in real-time data systems, cross-functional compliance structures, and external assurance providers. For small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), however, the path is far more complex. Fragmented regulatory requirements, limited budgets, and slower technology adoption often create barriers to meeting the new audit standards.

Yet SMEs remain critical links in global supply chains. To avoid being left behind, many will need to rely on collaborative solutions rather than individual investments. Industry-wide digital platforms, pooled audit programs, training partnerships, and shared capacity-building initiatives are emerging as viable models. These mechanisms not only lower costs but also provide smaller suppliers with a way to align with the rising demands around ESG, carbon, traceability, safety, and quality—all converging in a single audit framework.

4 moves to stay ahead

Data governance: Establish auditable “sources of truth” for emissions, labor hours, and material origins.

Digital traceability: Capture batch/lot and chain-of-custody data aligned with EU Digital Product Passport and FDA’s FSMA.

Risk-based due diligence: Follow OECD’s six-step model and ensure grievance mechanisms are in place.

AI-ready documentation: Keep master data structured to enable AI-driven compliance reviews.

The takeaway

Audits are no longer box-checking exercises — they are becoming the currency of trust in global trade. Companies that embed traceability, carbon accountability, and third-party assurance today won’t just meet tightening rules. They will earn a competitive edge in a marketplace where resilience, transparency, and low-carbon performance define the winners of tomorrow.",https://img.sdcexec.com/mindful/acbm/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/10/parinapril-adobestock-1651133848.MDG0WGNbxO.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&w=1200,N,,2025-11-29 15:00:15.768344

The focus now shifts from sweeping remodels to practical fixes, like tuning cooklines, upgrading ventilation, and rethinking gas versus electric tools that promise measurable savings and faster service. Here's an overview of how to make the most of these opportunities.

Reassessing the Hidden Drivers of Kitchen Energy Waste

Much of a kitchen's energy loss comes from small inefficiencies that stack up daily. Gas burners left idling, clogged hood filters, and poor heat recovery waste both fuel and money. It's like leaving a faucet running all night, except the leak is invisible and constant.

Chefs often underestimate standby loads from prep equipment, or how uneven refrigeration seals drive compressors to run nonstop. Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows restaurants can use up to 4 times more energy than a typical commercial building, so finding efficiency savings must be a priority in this industry.

Thermal imaging and smart meters now reveal where heat escapes or airflow stagnates. So instead of replacing everything, operators can start by auditing usage, tightening maintenance routines, and retraining staff. The biggest savings usually come not from new appliances, but from sharper control over the ones already in use.

Comparing Gas, Electric, and Hybrid Cooking Systems

Choosing between gas, electric, or hybrid systems now involves more than flavor or tradition. Energy pricing shifts and carbon disclosure rules are reshaping that choice.

Gas still offers instant control, but it vents more heat into the room, forcing hoods and HVAC systems to work harder. Electric induction units, on the other hand, send most of their energy directly into cookware, keeping kitchens cooler and cleaner. Hybrid lines blend both, letting operators match energy type to menu volume and cost.

In practice, a busy grill station might stay gas-fired to maintain peak throughput, while prep or saute areas switch to induction. It's like swapping muscle power for assisted gears on a bike, making things smoother and faster without losing control.

Upgrading Broilers and Ovens for Speed and Efficiency

Broilers and ovens are the heart of any cookline, yet they also rank among the hungriest energy users. Modern models use sensors, reflective panels, and insulated cavities to keep more heat on the food and less in the air. Conveyor and infrared broilers, for instance, deliver steady searing while cutting preheat and recovery times.

Before investing, you can compare different commercial broilers to gauge how throughput, fuel type, and vent requirements affect operating costs. Some new units reclaim exhaust heat to warm incoming air or preheat water, reducing total gas or electric demand.

Restaurants that upgrade older broilers often see payback within two years, especially when combined with utility rebates. The real gain goes beyond savings, though. Faster recovery means shorter ticket times and consistent quality, a quiet advantage that customers notice even if they never see the kitchen.

Smarter Ventilation for Cooler, Cheaper Kitchens

Ventilation often hides as a silent energy drain. Oversized hoods and unbalanced airflow can waste thousands each year by exhausting conditioned air faster than needed. A simple fix, like installing variable-speed fans or demand-controlled sensors, lets airflow adjust automatically with cooking load. When sensors detect idle equipment, fans slow, lights dim, and energy drops without staff effort.

Regular cleaning also matters. Grease buildup restricts flow and makes fans run harder, just as a clogged filter chokes an engine. Some kitchens now link hood monitoring to digital dashboards, allowing them to spot airflow issues before they escalate. So, smarter ventilation doesn't just lower bills. It keeps kitchens cooler, safer, and quieter, creating a more comfortable space where chefs can focus on food rather than heat.

Utility Rebates and Decarbonization Rules That Actually Pay Off

Utility incentives and carbon reduction rules now shape how restaurants plan upgrades. Many states tie rebates to verifiable energy savings, allowing operators to recover part of the cost of efficient cookers, hoods, or refrigeration. It's like trading in an old car for one that uses half the fuel, and getting paid for the switch.

Programs from utilities such as SoCalGas and Con Edison now cover audits, equipment rebates, and even kitchen staff training. The savings stack up quickly when combined with federal tax credits for electrification.

Tracking compliance is simpler, too. Smart meters and data logs supply the proof needed to qualify for funds. So, what once felt like bureaucratic red tape now becomes a profit tool. Those who act early lock in rebates before annual budgets close, turning environmental compliance into a measurable business advantage.

The Bottom Line

Cutting kitchen energy use no longer demands massive overhauls. It starts with smarter choices and daily awareness.

When restaurants treat efficiency as part of service, not just savings, every watt and calorie counts. The payoff arrives in quieter kitchens, steadier costs, and food that still tastes just as good.

America must lead on safety. - The Hill,"Kelly Wanser, opinion contributor, Kelly Wanser, opinion contributor",,,,,https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/5622203-us-lags-weather-modification/,"Here’s what should worry us: America is falling behind in the one area where we should lead — the science and data needed to ensure atmospheric safety and security.
Yet today, we lack the basic information infrastructure needed to evaluate or respond to atmospheric interventions to ensure public safety.
The path forward requires sustaining globally unique U.S. federal atmospheric science programs and rapidly expanding our knowledge base — not building deployment capabilities.
We cannot prevent everyone, everywhere from developing atmospheric interventions.
The atmosphere is emerging as a domain of strategic competition with profound implications for national security, economic competitiveness and public safety.","I understand why millions of Americans look up at the sky with concern. Videos of unusual cloud formations circulate on social media, accompanied by questions about “chemtrails” and secret weather modification programs.

While concerns often reflect misunderstandings about ordinary aircraft contrails and natural atmospheric phenomena, the underlying instinct — that something may be happening in our atmosphere that we don’t know enough about — is not exactly wrong.

Weather and climate modification are not conspiracy theories. They are real, expanding capabilities that demand public attention and government action.

The question is whether the United States will lead in ensuring they emerge in the world safely and transparently or whether we will cede this emerging strategic domain to private interests and foreign competitors.

Consider what we know: China operates the world’s most extensive weather modification program, involving around 35,000 personnel, with 20 percent growth in activity from 2024 to 2025.

President Xi declared that China would build a “weather superpower,” and his meteorological director stated, “weather modification technology is an important part of building a weather superpower.”

Other nations including the United Kingdom, Australia, United Arab Emirates and Japan have launched large research and development programs.

Last month, Stardust Solutions — a private company proposing to disperse particles in the stratosphere to influence global climate — secured $60 million in venture capital, the largest funding round ever for an atmospheric intervention company.

A few weeks prior, the New York Times featured a nonprofit proposal to fast-track dispersing particles into the stratosphere.

Private organizations face structural pressures that conflict with objective safety evaluation. Companies must advance their proprietary approach and move quickly to generate returns. Nonprofits advocating for specific interventions face pressures to advance the approaches they have championed and been funded to pursue.

Truly independent assessment must be conducted drawing on strong science by public institutions free from the incentives and pressures affecting both commercial ventures and advocacy nonprofits.

Here’s what should worry us: America is falling behind in the one area where we should lead — the science and data needed to ensure atmospheric safety and security.

The United States historically excelled at atmospheric observation and rigorous, independent scientific assessment. The U.S.-led Montreal Protocol’s success in protecting the ozone layer demonstrated the power of robust research and science-based decision-making.

Yet today, we lack the basic information infrastructure needed to evaluate or respond to atmospheric interventions to ensure public safety.

We are not adequately monitoring the atmosphere. Despite efforts by the U.S. government to provide a baseline of the stratosphere — the very region companies like Stardust target — right now we lack adequate aerial sampling measurements of its chemistry. American satellite instruments dedicated to observing the stratosphere remotely are projected to discontinue service soon, leaving us increasingly blind to a domain of growing strategic importance.

We cannot sufficiently project atmospheric effects of weather and climate interventions. Current models cannot predict the impact on weather patterns, precipitation, agriculture and ecosystems with the precision required for decision-making.

We have not developed protections to ensure safety. Without adequate observations and research, we lack the monitoring capabilities and regulatory frameworks to protect against risks to the ozone layer, changes in weather patterns and other potential side-effects and to compare them to a future Earth system without intervention.

This knowledge deficit has profound national security implications. A state with large-scale weather control capabilities could gain leverage in geopolitical conflicts, manipulate precipitation patterns affecting food, water, economic activity, communications and human health or conduct interventions that harm U.S. interests without clear attribution.

The path forward requires sustaining globally unique U.S. federal atmospheric science programs and rapidly expanding our knowledge base — not building deployment capabilities.

This means public investment in sustained atmospheric observations, improved models and analytical tools, comprehensive evaluation of intervention approaches and independent scientific assessment mechanisms.

To those concerned about secret programs: The transparency and public oversight enabled by research are precisely what we need more of, not less.

The real danger comes not from government and academic scientists conducting open research (such as atmospheric programs at NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency), but from private and foreign actors operating without transparency, public input or monitoring.

We cannot prevent everyone, everywhere from developing atmospheric interventions. But we can ensure the United States leads in building the knowledge base for safety and security. This requires reversing divestment trends, expanding funding for atmospheric observation infrastructure, modeling and science, and developing evidence-based regulatory frameworks.

The atmosphere is emerging as a domain of strategic competition with profound implications for national security, economic competitiveness and public safety. Public concerns about what’s happening in our atmosphere are valid.

Let’s channel them into action with the right investments in science and transparency to ensure atmospheric safety and security now, or risk losing control of the skies that shape our future.

The group flagged op-eds and coverage from Fox News, The Wall Street Journal and the New York Post from August to October this year as wrongfully “blaming high electricity bills in New Jersey” on “green-energy mandates.”

“Even though the issue is most pronounced in New Jersey, it is going to be happening probably all over the country. So, any coverage that is happening there will impact the coverage of the issue everywhere,” wrote Ilana Berger, author of the two reports and a senior researcher on the Media Matters’ team on climate and energy disinformation. The nonprofit, based in Washington, describes itself as a “progressive research and information center dedicated to comprehensively monitoring, analyzing, and correcting conservative misinformation in the U.S. media.”

According to a Senate Democratic Joint Economic Committee report released in early November, the average American household will pay about $100 more for electricity this year, with electric bills rising in 47 states.

New Jersey has the goal of 100 percent clean electricity by 2035, meaning all electricity sold in the state must come from “clean” sources under its strengthened Clean Energy Standard. This is accompanied by targets like 11 GW of offshore wind by 2040 and 2 GW of energy storage by 2030. But these are long-term build-outs, many of which are still being procured and, in the case of offshore wind, have faced challenges due to the retreat in federal support for the sector.

“The extreme hikes we are currently seeing are almost entirely attributable to data centers and their tremendous load,” Brian Lipman, director of New Jersey Rate Counsel, an independent state agency representing electricity consumers, said in an email.

PJM Interconnection, the regional grid operator for Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states, estimates that data centers alone will add about 30 GW in demand for the entire region by 2030, a demand equivalent to adding about 20 million homes to the grid.

Brendan Pierpont, the energy modeling chief of nonpartisan energy and climate think tank Energy Innovation, also pointed to PJM Interconnection’s slow progress in connecting more projects to the grid to match the increased demand.

As of Nov. 12, there are about 1,330 projects totaling at least 100 GW in capacity that are still waiting for interconnection with PJM. Most of the projects held up are renewables. According to a report by energy market intelligence firm Aurora Energy Research, if even about 10 percent of those renewables could be connected by 2026, they could have reduced the capacity price—the charge on electric bills that largely drove the recent price hikes—by about a quarter.

“The reason bills are going up is a simple supply and demand problem. PJM has not built enough supply while also not planning for an increase in demand from data centers,” said Alex Ambrose, an analyst with the nonpartisan think tank New Jersey Policy Perspective. “All those energy projects aren’t waiting in a queue for Governor Murphy’s approval. They’re waiting for PJM approval.”

Fox News, The Wall Street Journal and the New York Post did not respond to requests for comment.

As for plant retirements, coal plants like Logan and Chambers shut in 2022, and Oyster Creek nuclear plant closed in 2018. Keeping facilities like these running would mean expensive upgrades to meet tighter pollution rules. Retiring them avoids those upgrade costs and cuts pollution that drives asthma and premature deaths.

“Coal plants were uneconomic—they could not make enough money in the markets prior to the data center load. In fact, the coal plants in New Jersey were tied to expensive out-of-market contracts and their closure led to savings for New Jersey ratepayers,” Lipman said.

According to tracking by Media Matters, Murdoch-owned outlets laid the groundwork as early as August by blaming New Jersey’s higher electricity bills on green mandates and plant closures.

The opinion articles coincided with the gubernatorial campaign in the Garden State, where Democratic candidate Mikie Sherrill triumphed against Republican Jack Ciattarelli.

A Wall Street Journal op-ed by energy executive Paul H. Tice in early August faulted fossil-fuel retirements and the state’s 2035 clean-power target. Two days later, a New York Post op-ed tied hikes to “Democrats’ bungled energy policies.”

Within three days, Fox & Friends and America’s Newsroom followed with reports linking price spikes to coal and nuclear shutdowns. The segments briefly included a counterpoint from then-Democratic gubernatorial candidate Sherrill, who instead put the onus on PJM Interconnection.

Then the drumbeat intensified. Fox Business’ The Big Money Show accused a “green-obsessed” outgoing Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy of driving up costs. Three days later, the New York Post editorial board said “insane” clean energy policies were to blame, and Fox & Friends further amplified that line with commentary, claiming without basis that summer bills had “tripled” and that Democrats prioritize climate over affordability.

President Donald Trump jumped in on August 19, railing against wind and solar on his social media site Truth Social. Trump called them a “scam” and vowed to block them.

Meanwhile, in its endorsement of Republican Ciattarelli on Sept. 27, the New York Post editorial board claimed Democrats’ push for zero emissions sent bills soaring. A day after, The Wall Street Journal editorial board faulted clean-energy targets and restrictions against gas projects for rising prices.

“[The] actual Democratic policy in New Jersey, and nationwide, is deliberate energy scarcity—and the higher prices that go with it,” the editorial board, which is separate from its news operations, wrote.

Energy experts have sought to correct these claims.

“New Jersey has been a clean energy policy leader for decades, and if you look back to 2010, electricity prices were more or less flat for over a decade, rising slower than inflation until the recent PJM capacity market price surge,” said Pierpont in an email.

Lipman at the New Jersey Rate Counsel said that while some solar and energy-efficiency subsidies appear on people’s bills, they did not drive this summer’s sharp price increases, and short-term price bumps from offshore wind have yet to show up on bills because they haven’t been built and connected to the grid.

Allison Fisher, the climate and energy director of Media Matters, said this pattern wasn’t new. Murdoch-owned outlets repeatedly blamed clean energy for higher electricity prices to undercut the Inflation Reduction Act both before and after its passage in 2022, she said.

“Years before this moment, we already knew what the playbook was. So it definitely was not a surprise,” said Fisher.

Sherrill won the gubernatorial election and will take office on January 20, 2026.

Sherrill ran on an “affordability first” energy message, vowing to declare a state of emergency on utility costs and temporarily freeze rates on day one, while fast-tracking cheaper and cleaner in-state power generation and increasing oversight of utilities.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-1759299195-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-11-29 13:01:35.912379

The event fostered substantive discussions on next-generation solar systems, the strategic value of battery energy storage systems (BESS) in the energy transition, evolving two-part tariff structures, and targeted, forward-looking investment solutions. More than 100 attendees from industry associations, leading companies, and ecosystem partners joined the session to shape the future of clean energy in Vietnam.

Seizing Opportunities, Ushering in a New Era for Residential Solar

In a keynote address, Ms. Shen Lu, national general distributor for Shenzhen Skyworth Photovoltaic Technology Co., Ltd. (“Skyworth PV”) in Vietnam, delivered a comprehensive analysis of the current landscape and future trajectory of Vietnam’s residential solar market. She emphasized Vietnam’s exceptional solar energy resources, noting an average annual sunlight exceeding 2,000 hours, which provides a natural foundation for solar power generation. At present, however, PV applications are mostly seen in large ground-mounted power stations and commercial or industrial rooftop systems, with relatively limited adoption among ordinary households.

Simplifying Complexity, Redefining Home Solar

To address these market gaps, Skyworth PV announced the official launch of its SUN Mate Home Solar 2.0 solution, the result of extensive market research and technological innovation. The core proposition of this new offering is “making clean energy accessible,” effectively transforming complex solar power generation into a product as straightforward and user-friendly as a standard household appliance.

A defining feature of the SUN Mate series is its “plug-and-play” design. Unlike conventional solar installations that require professional design, complex construction, and structural modifications, SUN Mate truly achieves a “three no” principle: no design, no construction, and no modification needed. Homeowners are freed from concerns about complex installation requirements; whether for urban apartment balconies or rural home courtyards, a suitable and simple installation solution is readily available.

In everyday use, SUN Mate delivers equally impressive performance. The system produces power during daylight hours for direct household consumption, significantly cutting grid electricity usage and cost. Through Skyworth’s proprietary smart cloud platform and mobile app, users can monitor real-time generation data and equipment status, and connect with professional customer service when needed. This intelligent management experience—making solar energy “visible, manageable, and affordable”—enables households to adopt solar power effortlessly.

Versatile Designs for Vietnamese Homes

To enable broader clean energy adoption across Vietnamese households, Skyworth PV has engineered three distinct SUN Mate product configurations, each meticulously optimized for specific settings.

The Balcony Model fits modern urban living. Its compact structure and minimalist design enable seamless integration with various architectural styles. The unique bracket-based setup requires no special tools and preserves building structures, making installation possible even for apartment dwellers. Designed to withstand Vietnam’s rainy and windy seasons, the model offers enhanced stability to maintain safety and reliability in adverse weather conditions.

""Carney’s deal with Danielle Smith is the sellout of the century: scrapping climate legislation for a pipeline that will never be built,"" said Lewis, a veteran journalist and climate activist.
In response to the deal, the minister of Canadian culture, Steven Guilbeault, who formerly served as environment minister under the previous Liberal administration, resigned in protest.
""Filling this pipeline and expansion would require more oil sands mining, leading to more carbon pollution, more tailings, and worse impacts for communities near the tar sands,"" warned Brooks.
""The pipeline to BC would have to cross some of the most challenging terrain in Canada.","First Nations groups backed by environmental and conservationist allies in Canada are denouncing a pipeline and tanker infrastructure agreement announced Thursday between Liberal Prime Minister Mark Carney and Conservative Alberta Premier Danielle Smith, calling it a betrayal and promising to fight its implementation tooth and nail.

“We will use every tool in our toolbox to ensure that this pipeline does not go ahead,” said Heiltsuk Nation Chief Marilyn Slett in response to the Carney-Smith deal that would bring tens of millions of barrels of tar sands oil from Alberta to the coast of British Columbia for export by building new pipeline and lifting a moratorium against oil tankers operating in fragile British Columbia coastal water.

While Carney, who argues that the pipeline is in Canada's economic interest, had vowed to secure the support of First Nations before finalizing any agreement with Alberta, furious reactions to the deal made it clear that promise was not met.

Xhaaidlagha Gwaayaai, the president of the Haida nation, was emphatic: ""This project is not going to happen.""

The agreement, according to the New York Times, is part of Carney’s ""plan to curb Canada’s trade dependence on the United States, swings Canadian policy away from measures meant to fight climate change to focus instead on growing the oil and gas industry.""

In a statement, the Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs (UBCIC) ""loudly"" voiced its opposition to the memorandum of understanding signed by Carney and Smith.

""This MOU is nothing less than a high-risk and deeply irresponsible agreement that sacrifices Indigenous peoples, coastal communities, and the environment for political convenience,"" said Grand Chief Stewart Phillip, president of the UBCIC. ""By explicitly endorsing a new bitumen pipeline to BC's coast and promising to rewrite the Oil Tanker Moratorium Act, the federal government is resurrecting one of the most deeply flawed and divisive ideas in Canadian energy politics.""

Slett, who serves as secretary-treasurer of the UBCIC, said the agreement ""was negotiated without the involvement of the very Nations who would shoulder those risks, and to suggest ‘Indigenous co-ownership’ of a pipeline while ignoring the clear opposition of Coastal First Nations is unacceptable.""

Avi Lewis, running for the leadership of the progressive New Democratic Party (NDP) in the upcoming elections, decried the agreement as a failure of historic proportions.

""Carney’s deal with Danielle Smith is the sellout of the century: scrapping climate legislation for a pipeline that will never be built,"" said Lewis, a veteran journalist and climate activist. ""We need power lines, not pipelines. Our path is through climate leadership and building good jobs in the clean economy.""

In response to the deal, the minister of Canadian culture, Steven Guilbeault, who formerly served as environment minister under the previous Liberal administration, resigned in protest.

“Despite this difficult economic context, I remain one of those for whom environmental issues must remain front and center,” Guilbeault said in a statement.

""Over the past few months, several elements of the climate action plan I worked on as Minister of the Environment have been, or are about to be, dismantled,” he said. “In my view, these measures remain essential to our climate action plan.”

David Eby, the premier of British Columbia who opposes the new pipeline into his province and was not included in the discussions between Carney and Smith, echoed those who said the project is more dead than alive, despite the MOU, calling it a potential ""energy vampire"" that would distracts from better energy solutions that don't carry all the baggage of this proposed project.

“With all of the variables that have yet to be fulfilled—no proponent, no route, no money, no First Nations support—that it cannot draw limited federal resources, limited Indigenous governance resources, limited provincial resources away from the real projects that will employ people,” Eby added.

Keith Brooks, the program director at Environmental Defence, decried the deal as ""worse than we had anticipated"" and ""a gift to the oil industry and Alberta Premier Smith, at the expense of practically everyone else.""

""Filling this pipeline and expansion would require more oil sands mining, leading to more carbon pollution, more tailings, and worse impacts for communities near the tar sands,"" warned Brooks. ""The pipeline to BC would have to cross some of the most challenging terrain in Canada. The impacts of construction would be severe, and the impacts of a spill, devastating.""

Jessica Green, a professor at the University of Toronto focused on environmental politics, equated the ""reckless"" deal to a ""climate dumpster fire"" and called the push for more tar sands pipelines in Canada ""the energy equivalent [of] investing in VHS tapes in 2025.""",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=62255977&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C166%2C0%2C167,N,,2025-11-29 12:02:29.582741
,Texas Environment,2025-11-29 15:13:05+00:00,Rio Grande Guardian,Raise Your Hand Texas: We propose the 'Legacy Education Fund' endowment,Raise Your Hand Texas,,,,,"https://riograndeguardian.com/stories/raise-your-hand-texas-we-propose-the-legacy-education-fund-endowment,47677","To address this, Raise Your Hand Texas proposes creating a “Legacy Education Fund,” a new endowment that could broaden funding sources and increase resources for schools across the state.
“The ‘Legacy Education Fund’ is about preparing Texas schools for the future—thinking 10 to 20 years ahead, not just the next budget cycle.
How the Legacy Education Fund would work The “Legacy Education Fund” could operate as an endowment working alongside the existing Permanent School Fund (PSF).
“The ‘Legacy Education Fund’ is about adding new dollars to the system, not just moving the same money,” Popinski said.
Decisions made during the 90th Legislative Session, set to begin in January 2027, could establish a new direction for funding Texas public education.","Texas has one of the nation’s largest and fastest-growing economies, yet its per-student public school funding remains in the bottom 10 nationally. During the 89th Legislative Session, lawmakers approved House Bill 2, providing $8.5 billion in public education funding for the 2025-26 biennium.

Despite billions invested during the 89th Legislative Session, school districts still face many challenges, including school closures, staff layoffs, and budget deficits.

To address this, Raise Your Hand Texas proposes creating a “Legacy Education Fund,” a new endowment that could broaden funding sources and increase resources for schools across the state.

“We can’t keep waiting for each legislative session to patch the same school funding gaps,” said Bob Popinski, dean of policy for Raise Your Hand Texas. “The ‘Legacy Education Fund’ is about preparing Texas schools for the future—thinking 10 to 20 years ahead, not just the next budget cycle. There will be an estimated $28.5 billion in our Economic Stabilization Fund, also known as the Rainy Day Fund. That money could help seed a new endowment fund to support public education in ways our current funding methods cannot.”

Texas schools are under financial pressure

In Texas classrooms, the effects of underfunding are visible daily. Students face larger class

sizes and fewer resources; teachers take on heavier workloads; support staff cover extra duties; and district leaders stretch budgets to cover the essentials. Rising costs, inflation, and new state mandates make the challenge even more difficult.

Despite the Texas Legislature’s recent investment, Texas spends about $3,500 less per student than the national average. The state’s two-year budget cycle adds uncertainty, forcing schools to make long-term commitments without dependable support.

“Districts are constantly stretching resources to cover basic needs,” Popinski said. “Without steady, long-term funding, they’re busy fighting fires and catching up instead of investing in student success.”

The proposed “Legacy Education Fund” aims to address this challenge by providing a reliable, supplemental revenue source.

How the Legacy Education Fund would work

The “Legacy Education Fund” could operate as an endowment working alongside the existing Permanent School Fund (PSF). Funded through an initial investment, the fund’s principal would be invested to generate earnings, which would be distributed to support education across the state. This creates a self-sustaining revenue source that grows over time, providing schools with financial stability.

Currently, funding sources such as lottery proceeds and the PSF help pay for public education through formulas set by the Texas Legislature. However, neither of these increases the total dollars flowing into classrooms; they determine how schools receive funding, not how much funding they receive.

“The ‘Legacy Education Fund’ is about adding new dollars to the system, not just moving the same money,” Popinski said. “It would provide schools with additional funding on top of what they already receive. The goal isn’t to replace existing support but to strengthen it, giving districts a more stable and predictable foundation.”

Benefits for schools

The “Legacy Education Fund” would give Texas schools more than funding. It would provide Texas with:

● Durability: guaranteeing future funding regardless of the political or economic climate

● Diversified funding streams: introducing reliable funding sources beyond current school funding

● Stability: allowing districts to make long-term decisions without worrying about the uncertainty in two-year state budgets

● Competitive investment: fueling economic growth, promoting healthier communities, enhancing quality of life, and setting Texas on the path to match other states’ investments in public school students

● Legacy: establishing an endowment as a permanent promise to Texas kids and the down payment on a quality education

Other states, including Alabama, Colorado, Mississippi, and Connecticut, have established public education endowments funded by general revenue and private contributions. These funds effectively support various school needs—from core expenses to programs, technology, and facility improvements—showing the potential impact a similar approach could have in Texas.

It’s time for lawmakers to take action

During the 90th Legislative Session, legislators have the opportunity to create a different type of permanent, growing funding source that could transform public schools for decades.

If lawmakers take action during the next legislative session, Texas could move beyond short-term fixes and provide districts with a stable, predictable foundation to meet current and future needs.

The fund’s implementation—initial investment, ongoing contributions, and governance—will shape the long-term impact on Texas schools. Decisions made during the 90th Legislative Session, set to begin in January 2027, could establish a new direction for funding Texas public education.",https://gamma.creativecirclecdn.com/riogrande/original/20250430-134218-887-ryht-building-exterior-congress.jpg,N,,2025-11-29 11:01:16.964995

As you shop this Small Business Saturday, remember how rulemakers in Washington impact your costs and your choices.","When you’re in line at your favorite small business on Small Business Saturday, you’re probably not thinking about how the rules the government creates affect your purchases. Here in Washington, D.C., it’s easy for policymakers and bureaucrats to lose sight of how poorly crafted rules can impact your costs at the point of sale, or how paperwork burdens hamper the ability of your favorite local shop to provide excellent service and a robust selection of merchandise.

Start with the mountain of paperwork that the boutique or specialty store you’re frequenting faces. These direct costs hurt that store’s margins and take up time for the owner and the staff as they provide a service to you and your community. That, in turn, makes your experience whenever you shop more painful than it should be.

Paperwork comes in lots of forms. For instance, the Internal Revenue Service requires every business with employees, from the largest tech companies to the smallest boutique, to file Form 941, the “Employer’s Quarterly Tax Return,” four times per year.

Chief Counsel Casey B. Mulligan has done extensive research on this form and finds that it is the fifth largest paperwork burden the government puts on citizens, accounting for 470 million hours of time.

Moving to yearly reporting would save small businesses 224 million hours and $20.1 billion annually, freeing up time for your favorite local businesses to increase staffing at the register and lower their prices. That allows these shops to pass those lower costs onto you.

Washington’s paperwork burden does not only come in the form of tax forms. Rules like the Consumer Product Safety Commission Certificates of Compliance require additional paperwork in the form of product registration for every single import and increase the stakes for clerical errors.

If you are buying a German board game for your brother, or a Japanese collectible for your daughter, the small hobby shop that imports your purchase must electronically upload a slew of information for each unique product. If there are any inconsistencies at Customs, the shipment is flagged for additional review. That means delays, rejections, or seizure for the business, and an unhappy Christmas for your family.

These paperwork burdens are so severe that Advocacy has placed both Form 941 and the certificates of compliance rule on our list of Most Wanted reforms. Washington’s choice to bury America’s Main Street under mountains of paperwork affects your time in line and your ability to choose what to buy your family for the holidays.

These problems are only the tip of the iceberg. The stores you frequent also deal with upstream, or indirect costs, from rules. If the government imposes rules that lead to costs on producers of raw materials or manufactured goods, those producers then must pass those costs down to wholesalers, retailers, or consumers. Worst of all, the impact analyses that agencies conduct to demonstrate the costs of these rules on small businesses often do not consider these indirect costs at all.

A rule like the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s Heat Injury and Illness Prevention rule is a good example. The decorations you might pick up for Christmas at your local winter market might become more expensive because the small manufacturers that produce them would be required to meet very specific heat-mitigation requirements. Many of those requirements are burdensome thanks to a one-size-fits-all standard.

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations that set fuel emissions standards also drive up the costs of your holiday. If the local tree farm needs to switch to a more efficient vehicle, it costs thousands of dollars, and those costs get passed on to you. Under President Trump, the EPA is removing those regulations, with a potential cost savings in the hundreds of billions of dollars.

As you shop this Small Business Saturday, remember how rulemakers in Washington impact your costs and your choices. Advocacy is here to actively work with regulators in Washington, D.C. to reduce that burden, freeing up small businesses all over the United States, growing the economy, and driving down the cost of your Christmas.",https://advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Advo-A-seal-150x150.png,N,,2025-11-29 13:59:57.326214

Net Power (NYSE:NPWR) is an exciting utilities company with a unique patented technology which could transform the energy markets in the US. Data centers is at the epicenter of electricity demand in the US and because of the attractive production model NPWR and low cost of scaling its a lucrative bet on this.

Technology

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with NPWR.

Is NPWR fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.

NPWR has a patented protected technology which uses natural gas and oxygen for its two inputs. The two elements are combusted which produces CO2 and water. This drives a turboexpander which is what produces the electricity. What makes it so special is that once the water has been moved out and separated the CO2 is returned to the turboexpander which powers it a second time, which as you might guess increases output and efficiency. Once there is too much CO2 produced it is pumped out of the system into underground storages.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that in 2021, methane emissions from natural gas and petroleum systems and from abandoned oil and natural gas wells were the source of about 33% of total U.S. methane emissions and about 4% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.

Natural gas is a much cleaner energy supply, but it can be even cleaner with the proprietary technology that NPWR has. The CO2 that gets pumped out would end up in two different locations, either class II wells where its later used to increase productivity at oil and gas production sites. The second option is class VI cells where it is sealed off and stored for all eternity.

Allam-Fetvedt Cycle

The Allam-Fetvedt Cycle is what enables NPWR to be a large-scale power generation company eventually. Once it went public it came with this technology as a patent and have exclusive rights. It adds on the image you see above here.

In commercial use it would when electricity prices are low produce oxygen with energy and then store this as a liquid. When prices increase this stored oxygen would then be used to produce electricity.

This oxygen storage method makes it one of the most cost-effective and long-duration energy storages in the world. It makes it incredibly attractive for data centers as it provides moderate balancing and higher potential returns too. Testing for this is done at the La Forte site in Texas along with scaling equipment for Baker Hughes.

Looking ahead, we expect to complete Phase 1 of the program this year. Phase 2 will commence later this year and most likely conclude in early 2026. Additionally, design and site preparations are already underway for Phases 3 and 4, which are scheduled for completion in 2026 and 2027, respectively.

During the last quarter it had meaningful progress at the site and plans seem to be on schedule so far. Start-up speed has increased, plant automation added and overall plant performance has gone up.

Pathway

NPWR is on track to deliver 97% carbon capture starting with its Project Permian. It's the company's first expected commercial-scale facility for using its technology. It will begin in the Midland of Texas. The project began construction in Q3 2024 and is expected to be finished and up and running in 2028 hopefully. During this period there has been revision to the cost, the latest pointing to $1.7 - 2 billion, up from the original $750 - 950 million.

The CEO Danny Rice blamed the cause on inflationary impacts on prices and increased interest in building gas-turbines causing bottlenecks.

The cost was a little bit of a surprise take a step back and look at where we can cut costs without cutting safety and reliability

Cost-cutting is where the focus should be right now in scaling its project. It's financially stable with a large cash pile, but raising further capital through equity will negatively impact the share price and investor morale.

We've seen the last couple of years a shift in the market to as much natural gas generation as possible. It's the only thing that can scale to the amount needed and offers affordability

This is what NPWR is playing on. History can teach us that power demand will be explosive during this data center buildout. Between 2000 and 2005 the US power demand increased by 90%, and a further 24% between 2005 and 2009. The forecasts during that period where largely overstated, predicting major power outages which never happened.

Interestingly, between 2010 and 2018 demand was basically flat because of new technological advancements which reduced the consumption at the same time making them more efficient. Some models point to between 200 TWh/year to 1,050 TWh/year by 2030. For context, on the higher end it would represent a quarter of the US annual electricity generation in 2023 (which was 4,178 TWh/year). Most of the assumptions puts 2030 consumption at 325 TWh/year to 580 TWh/year, representing between 6.5 - 12.5% of the USs annual electricity production.

Because of the massive ramp up companies are searching for any opportunity out there. The tech giants like Meta Platforms (META) and Amazon (AMZN) are eying nuclear power to support the buildout. Because gas is the fastest to scale it's also what makes NPWR such a lucrative investment right now, because it's not only a play on increased power demand, but clean power. With 97% carbon capture efficiency it will be more attractive for companies to get their energy from it in order to meet emission quotas.

Technology At Scale

NPWR plans that its power plants will be factory produced modular facilities which directly drives down both costs and increases the rate of scaling.

The company is still in the early stages so they aren't posting too many financial models where revenues might land. But from a 2023 analyst day presentation they presented some compelling cases in terms of scalability. The chart shows the impact of different numbers of plants deployed per year in EBITDA. At 10 on the middle range of 15 per year it would translate into nearly $1 billion EBITDA. Seeing as most utilities companies trade at 11 - 12x EV/EBITDA it makes a compelling case that NPWR might have a lot of upside seeing as its current market cap is just below $700 million, or $282 million in EV.

With the delays which occurred in 2025 due to rising costs it seems that 2028 will now be the year when the first site goes online. NPWR is backed by Occidental Petroleum (OXY) so it made sense the first site would be at one of its assets.

There have been some material changes from this original business plan where it would sell the plants to companies and receive a license fee from this. That is what the chart showed. But because of the rise in data center demand NPWR is changing and looking to operate its assets fully instead, or selling part stakes to private equity to raise cash in the short-term. This should increase liquidity and make scaling both faster and less leveraged.

In the presentation it outlined how a fully stand alone Net Power plant can generate 415 MWs per day with 50 million cubic feet of natural gas inputs per day. This comes out to 550 megawatts of thermal input where 80% becomes power.

In just a few short months, Project Permian LCOE has meaningfully improved from over $150 per megawatt hour to now under $100 per megawatt hour,

During the Q2 call management outlined the cost-reductions made to LCOE (levelized cost of electricity).

With the new integration they also state they are confident in getting below $100 MWh LCOE right out of the gate. We're kind of sitting in a place where if we're starting in that $1.6 billion to $1.9 billion sort of zip code, we feel pretty good about being able to get down to the $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion range -- $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion for the stand-alone net power unit.

Over time NPWR is targeting a lower cost of unit as well, which as stated before, due to the better integration of CO2 among other things, getting below $100 MWh LCOE seems reasonable. It is however promising to see the cost per unit falling so drastically as the company builds more.

Between 2021 and 2023 Texas averaged about $117 MWh in wholesale electricity prices. During 2025 so far the blended rate between all three categories as seen above is $133.2 MWh. This gives NPWR a gross profit of at least $33.2 per MW. It stated that one unit produces 415 MWh/day which is $1.3 million in daily revenues, $39.8 million in monthly revenues and $484 million annually. Based on the LCOE and current market price each unit would run at about 33 - 35% gross margins, $159 million gross profits.

Here is a cost breakdown of what one plant would look like. Assuming the same market price as today net income is $11.5 million. These are rough estimates which is the best I can do until the company actually has started to produce and sell. LCOE is interesting here as it covers all costs associated with producing.

CEO Daniel Rice pointed to it potentially going below $80 eventually as the core Capex in the cycle goes down with time.NPWR is investing $2 billion for the Permian Basin site, which should result in $100 million annual depreciation, laid out over 20 years. As costs come down this should normalize at $60 million instead. Added back in cash flows are $251 million which is strong, showing that investments might eventually pay for themselves.

Here is the bull case scenario for NPWR. Sales have gone to $175 MWh which is driven by increased demand from data centers, increasing population and other. LCOE goes down to $80 MWh as outlined by the CEO. Cost per unit goes down to bringing depreciation to $60 million annually. Overall, FCF of $338 million and net income of $178 million.

NPWR hasn't set a specific plan which outlines how many plants they intend on making in the next 10 years, but the CEO mentions 20 years somewhat frequently along with 10 - 20 units made. During 10 years I'll make the assumption that NPWR will build another 5 to be conservative. The first in 2028 and the rest afterwards. Seeing as NPWR won't realize the bull case model until later on I'll make my projections using the first one for the year 2035.

Revenue $2.42 billion

Operating income $795 million

Free Cash Flow $1.255 billion

Net Income $57.5 million

I'm expecting a certain level of equity financing which will dilute shares over 10 years. Raising between $60 - $70 million annually would today require to raise the outstanding amount by 10% give or take. Once NPWR starts to generate more FCF I see the dilution rate normalizing at 5 - 6% annually. So by year 2035 shares would be 129 million and EPS $0.44. Based on today's price that is a P/E of 7.95. Based on cash flows its $9.72 per share or 0.36x FWD FCF.

The sector averages 20x FWD earnings and 16x FWD FCF. This shows the clear upside in share price NPWR could undergo during the next 10 years if it manages to establish just 5 units.It's a small company which is still in the early days but has a massive run up. Industry tailwinds are strong and not likely to fade. Power demand is here now and it's not waiting, which makes the case for rising electricity costs by 2035 even if supply grows. I'm not new to small caps like this and I'm experienced with the volatility that comes with it.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/us.finance.gurufocus/04dd6a9443291883d9ec4829dc7936ce,N,,2025-11-29 13:01:42.733602

I'm a policy analyst for the Clean Energy Districts of Iowa (CEDI) and an intervenor in Alliant Energy's rate cases. I most recently testified in Docket No. RPU-2025-0003, which involves Alliant’s request for advance ratemaking principles to support up to 1,000 megawatts of new wind generation. My testimony emphasizes customer affordability, transparency, and accountability as key to ensuring that new clean energy investments benefit all Iowans.

The bottom line is that clean energy must be affordable and equitable. If a utility cannot show that new wind projects provide net economic benefits for customers via utility ownership, they should not be financing them through rates paid by customers. Alliant customers should not be paying for any utility investment that benefits shareholders more than ratepayers.

Specifically, here are CEDI's key recommendations on the New Wind project:

• Reduce Alliant’s’ proposed cost cap of $3,020/kW, which is 26% higher than a similar project approved earlier this year.

• Deny recovery of undocumented ‘Owner’s Costs’ lacking supporting data.

• Adopt a lower return on equity (ROE) of 8% to 9% instead of the company’s requested 11.25%, aligning with recent independent assessments.

• Limit future turbine repowering cost recovery to Alliant’s cost of debt, not its full ROE.

• Restrict approval to projects that qualify for federal Production Tax Credits (PTCs) and demonstrate net customer benefits.

• Add a new Resource Evaluation Study principle to improve transparency, stakeholder engagement, and long-term planning.

New data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows Iowa’s coal generation has increased by 46.5% year-to-date, while natural gas generation declined and renewable output rose only slightly. Commercial electricity prices increased about 8% over the same period.

These are trends in the wrong direction. Iowa needs more clean energy, but the investments must be responsible, cost-effective, and fair to customers.

The first photovoltaic cells were invented at Bell Laboratories in the early 1950s (research subsidized by federal grants). In the 1970s, the United States was implementing this technology to become the world’s manufacturing leader of solar panels (again subsidized by federal grants). But who is the world’s manufacturing leader of solar panels today? China!

This short-sightedness plays out repeatedly. The United States invents new technologies, but it is other countries who mass manufacture them. Think semiconductors, personal computers, smartphones, LCD displays, etc. We don’t support the initial start-up production of our own inventions.

Unfortunately, this seems to be happening again. The Inflation Reduction Act supplied new funds to support solar, wind, and geothermal production. Many innovative projects got started and were on their way to providing new jobs and needed energy production. But the Big Beautiful Bill eliminated most of this support and today there are many energy projects that were near completion but are now stalled and going nowhere.

This is so short-sighted. Solar, wind, and nuclear energy production is a needed piece of our future, regardless of what you might believe about human-caused climate change. So why are we still subsiding in coal, oil, and gas production to the tune of $34.8 billion a year and starving nuclear, solar, wind, and geothermal start-ups?

Article content

Suspending the regime in Alberta was one component of a sweeping energy pact unveiled Thursday between Prime Minister Mark Carney and Premier Danielle Smith. The regulations were suspended on the condition Alberta adopt a stronger industrial carbon pricing regime.

Article content

“We have always said that if a province has an equivalent set of regulations that deliver the same outcomes as the clean electricity regulations, we are prepared to enter into equivalency agreements with those provinces,” Hodgson said in a phone interview.

Article content

Provinces including Ontario, Saskatchewan and New Brunswick have criticized the federal rules, particularly for the constraints they place on building new gas-fired power plants.

Article content

The federal government set a deadline of April 1 for Alberta to come up with improvements to its industrial carbon markets, known as the Technology Innovation and Emissions Reduction System, or TIER.

Article content

Alberta’s system will ramp up to “a minimum effective credit price” of C$130 ($93) per tonne, according to the pact. The province will also commit to “globally competitive, long-term carbon effective prices, carbon levy recycling protocols, and sector-specific stringency factors.”

“We’ll be working through how they will restructure their TIER system,” Hodgson said, adding the TIER must cover the electricity grid strongly enough to get it to net zero by 2050.

Article content

The energy pact rolled back other Trudeau-era environmental policies, including scrapping an emissions cap on the oil and gas sector and contemplating exemptions to a ban on oil tankers along the coast of northern British Columbia. The moves have generated controversy and played a part in the resignation from cabinet of Culture Minister Steven Guilbeault, a former high-profile environmental activist.

By technology, alkaline electrolyzers accounted for largest market share in 2024.

Based on technology, the Electrolyzers Market is segmented into alkaline, proton exchange membrane (PEM), solid oxide, and anion exchange membrane (AEM). The alkaline segment, by technology, held the largest market share in 2024 due to its technological maturity, lower cost, and suitability for large industrial hydrogen production. Demand for PEM electrolyzers is growing rapidly due to their ability to respond quickly to variable renewable energy sources and produce high-purity hydrogen. Solid oxide electrolyzers offer high efficiency and are gaining traction in high-temperature industrial applications, while AEM electrolyzers are emerging as a low-cost alternative for distributed and small-scale hydrogen generation.

AEM electrolyzers to record highest CAGR during forecast period.

AEM electrolyzers are expected to register the highest CAGR in the global Electrolyzers Market during the forecast period. AEM technology is gaining rapid traction due to its potential to combine the low-cost advantages of alkaline systems with improved efficiency and compact designs similar to PEM electrolyzers. This makes AEM particularly attractive for distributed hydrogen production, small- to medium-sized industrial users, and emerging fuel applications where cost competitiveness and system flexibility are critical. The strong growth of AEM electrolyzers is further supported by increasing R&D investments, declining material costs, and the development of non-precious metal catalysts, which reduce overall system CAPEX. Their compatibility with intermittent renewable energy and lower balance-of-plant complexity makes them suitable for decentralized green hydrogen projects across residential, commercial, and industrial segments. As countries accelerate the adoption of hydrogen and support innovation-driven technologies, AEM systems are becoming one of the most promising next-generation solutions within the electrolyzer technology landscape.

Europe to be fastest-growing market for electrolyzers during forecast period.

Europe is projected to remain a key growth hub in the global Electrolyzers Market, driven by accelerated clean energy investments, stringent emissions regulations, and strong regional focus on energy security. The increasing deployment of hydrogen-ready industrial clusters, cross-border hydrogen corridors, and large-scale storage projects is boosting the adoption of electrolyzers across multiple sectors. The region is also advancing flagship green hydrogen initiatives linked to aviation fuels, maritime transport, and district heating.

SMX allows industries to authenticate the materials they use regardless of where the refining or processing took place.
Forward-Looking Statements The information in this press release includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding expectations, hopes, beliefs, intentions or strategies regarding the future.","The world has entered a supply chain cold war where data, authenticity, and material truth matter more than speed or scale. Western companies are discovering they cannot compete with state-controlled systems unless they can verify the origin and purity of the materials they depend on. SMX (NASDAQ:SMX) stepped into this gap with molecular-level verification that embeds identity directly into metals, minerals, and industrial feedstocks. It gives Western manufacturers the clarity they have been missing for years.

This matters because global supply chains have long been shaped by countries that control both production and certification. When a single region dominates refining, processing, and verification, the rest of the world has limited visibility and even less leverage. SMX disrupts that imbalance by giving companies a tool to confirm material integrity without relying on distant facilities, opaque documentation or state-managed audit systems.

The shift transforms verification from a vulnerability into a competitive advantage. SMX allows industries to authenticate the materials they use regardless of where the refining or processing took place. It decentralizes truth, allowing companies to build their compliance, manufacturing and sourcing strategies on facts that cannot be manipulated or hidden inside the supply chain.

Why Western Industries Need Proof to Compete

Western manufacturers are operating under extreme pressure. They are expected to scale clean energy systems, produce advanced semiconductors, rebuild domestic industrial capacity, and secure defense-grade materials at unprecedented speed. None of this works without verified feedstock. Solar companies cannot risk mislabeled silicon. EV manufacturers cannot rely on uncertain, rare-earth sources. Defense contractors cannot accept alloys with unconfirmed origins. Proof is now structural, not optional.

Legacy systems cannot meet these demands. Documentation is lost between jurisdictions. Certificates vary by region. Supply chain records lack uniformity. Risk grows with each transfer point. SMX solves this by embedding identity into the material itself, making verification independent of external paperwork or geopolitical bottlenecks. It gives companies direct control over their own certainty.

That shift is already reshaping procurement strategies. Companies are prioritizing materials with built-in authentication over shipments that arrive with stacks of documents. Regulators are favoring supply chains that can demonstrate instant traceability. Investors are gravitating toward companies that adopt self-verifying materials because they represent lower compliance risk and higher operational resilience. SMX is emerging as the verification framework that supports this new industrial landscape.

A New Geopolitical Framework for Material Truth

A new global paradigm is forming around the ability to guarantee material truth. The winners in the next industrial cycle will not be the regions with the cheapest production. They will be the companies and nations that can provide authenticity at the source, long before a component reaches a factory floor. SMX is creating that framework by giving materials a forensic identity that withstands every transformation.

This identity strengthens the entire value chain. Manufacturers gain predictable feedstock. Compliance teams gain clarity that aligns with rising regulatory expectations. Defense and energy sectors gain supply assurance that does not collapse under geopolitical strain. The result is a system where authenticity is built into the material instead of being reconstructed through paperwork vulnerable to manipulation.

The larger implication is clear. The future of strategic manufacturing will follow the regions and companies that guarantee material integrity. SMX is enabling that shift by giving the world a structure where trust is not granted, assumed or outsourced. It is earned at the molecular level and carried forward by every shipment that enters the modern industrial economy.

Amazon is the world’s largest corporate purchaser of renewables, with more than 600 wind and solar projects in the works nationwide, according to the company’s website.
Trump has moved to scuttle major wind and solar energy projects since he returned to the White House in January.
Solar projects must break ground by July to be eligible for tax credits that Congress voted to eliminate years earlier than previously planned.
To date, the group has broken ground on 24 megawatts of solar projects worth more than $20 million that benefit low-income households.","Solar power is surging across the U.S. as costs plummet and companies ramp up large-scale commercial projects, but experts say the green industry faces an uncertain future as the Trump administration scraps federal subsidies that have helped foster growth of the clean energy sector.

Last year, more than 90% of all new U.S. electrical generating capacity came from renewable sources, with solar power accounting for more than 81% — the largest single-year increase from any energy source in two decades, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

Nationwide, there are enough solar installations to power more than 40 million homes, with utility-scale solar accounting for 71% of that capacity, says the Solar Energy Industries Association. A typical 100 megawatt solar project produces enough energy to power 17,200 average U.S. homes, according to the industry group.

“This growth is a testament to the power of American innovation,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, SEIA’s president and CEO. “We’re building factories, hiring American workers and showing that solar energy means made-in-America energy.”

But Hopper said the growth of the industry will be impacted by the decision of President Donald Trump’s administration to end federal subsidies for solar and other clean energy projects.

The Trump administration’s opposition to solar power creates a “risk driving investment overseas, stifling job creation,” she said, “raising costs on consumers, and handing America’s manufacturing advantage to our competitors.”

“This industry has proven what’s possible when businesses have the certainty to invest,” Hopper said. “If the administration does not reverse its harmful actions that have undermined market certainty, energy costs will rise even further, and the next wave of factories and jobs could be at risk.”

How it works

Solar energy, which was initially developed in the late 1800s, essentially works by converting energy from the sun into power, which produces both electricity and heat.

Solar panels, installed on a rooftop or in a utility-scale array, are generally silicon-based within a metal frame and glass casing. When this material is exposed to photons of sunlight, it releases electrons and produces an electric charge. The current is then converted for use in homes and businesses or to power the electric grid.

The rapid expansion of large-scale solar farms and smaller installations on rooftops in recent years has largely been driven by falling costs for the technology. China, one of the world’s largest solar producers, has pushed the cost of panels down by almost 90% over the past decade, according to energy analysts.

Globally, solar capacity is set to double by 2030, with China, India and other countries leading the charge through massive utility-scale projects and creative financing models.

Meanwhile, major corporations such as Amazon, Tesla and Target are scaling solar quickly to lower their operating costs and reduce their carbon footprint. Amazon is the world’s largest corporate purchaser of renewables, with more than 600 wind and solar projects in the works nationwide, according to the company’s website.

As the technology itself improves, wind and solar are offering some of the cheapest and fastest ways to provide electric power, supporters say.

Administrative priorities

Experts say the industry faces darkening skies as the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress roll back clean energy tax credits and throw up roadblocks to renewable energy projects, which threatens to leave the United States behind other countries in the shift to solar power and renewables.

Trump has moved to scuttle major wind and solar energy projects since he returned to the White House in January.

Trump’s hand-picked Interior Secretary Doug Burgum issued a series of orders earlier this year to restrict solar and wind development, including changing the criteria for evaluating renewable energy projects on federal lands, requiring that the Interior secretary personally approve each project.

“Based on common sense, arithmetic and physics, wind and solar projects are highly inefficient uses of federal lands,” Burgum said in a statement, claiming it will “level the playing field for dispatchable, cost-effective and secure energy sources,” such as “clean” coal and natural gas.

Meanwhile, Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” Act, signed in July, mandates oil and gas lease sales, fast-tracks environmental reviews and opens millions of acres of public land for coal leasing and terminates incentives for solar power, including one that offered homeowners a federal tax credit of up to $10,500 for installing rooftop solar panels.

Many companies with projects in the works are scrambling to install solar panels, wind turbines and batteries the size of shipping containers before federal tax credits expire or become harder to claim. Solar projects must break ground by July to be eligible for tax credits that Congress voted to eliminate years earlier than previously planned.

In August, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency pulled the plug on the $7 billion Solar for All program, approved by Congress in 2023 as part of the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act to expand solar power to low-income households.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called it a “boondoggle” that’s “rife with grift” from unscrupulous companies taking cuts from the federally funded grants. The move prompted federal lawsuits from states, labor unions and the solar industry.

Among the companies impacted by the grant freeze is Groundswell, a nonprofit that works in several Southern states, including Georgia, Mississippi and Alabama, which was expecting $156 million. To date, the group has broken ground on 24 megawatts of solar projects worth more than $20 million that benefit low-income households.

“There’s a lot at stake,” Groundswell CEO Michelle Moore said in a statement. “These projects — located in small towns across seven states, all of which were sited in partnership with the local community — now hang in the balance.”

‘No going back’

Environmentalists say, despite the pushback by the Trump administration, the economics of solar are strong and it has proven itself as a valuable renewable energy to help reduce excess greenhouse gas emissions that scientists say are contributing to a warmer planet, fueling devastating storms and rising seas.

“Globally, there is no going back on this,” Kate Sinding Daly, vice president for law and policy at the New England-based Conservation Law Foundation. “Wind and solar are the future of renewable energy. The momentum may be slowed in this country, but it’s not going to be reversed.”

The solar power movement has plenty of critics who argue the full-throttled embrace of clean energy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will ultimately drive up consumer costs, cause rolling blackouts and won’t provide enough electricity to meet demands, among other criticisms.

Lisa Linowes, a New Hampshire-based energy policy analyst, argues that states such as California, New York and Massachusetts are pushing through policies aimed at encouraging the expansion of green energy, which are hurting energy consumers, driving up costs and putting increased pressure on the nation’s electric grid.

“The public is largely in the dark about what’s happening with renewable energy,” she said. “The states and environmentalists who are pushing for a net-zero environment are telling everyone that wind and solar are the cheapest forms of electricity. But the reality is it’s cost-prohibitive, and we just don’t have the land for it.”

One way states are trying to accelerate the shift to solar power through net-metering programs, which allow consumers who install rooftop solar on their homes to pay lower rates for electricity for sharing power with the regional grid. Some states require utilities to buy the electricity generated by solar power at retail prices.

But Linowes and other critics say those programs are largely benefiting homeowners who can afford to install rooftop solar, with ratepayers who aren’t benefiting directly from net-metering picking up the tab. Those costs have added to utility bills in regions such as the northeast, which already has some of the highest energy costs in the nation.

“Net-metering is one of the largest portions of a utility bill in Massachusetts and other states with these programs,” Linowes said. “These policies are hurting energy consumers.”

A recent report by the Fiscal Alliance Foundation, Americans for Prosperity Foundation and other conservative groups looked at six New England states’ decarbonization plans and said it would cost the states $815 billion collectively through 2050, with the average household paying nearly $100 more a year for electricity.

Commercial employers would see their costs rise by about $489 per year, while industrial manufacturing customers would see their electric bills increase by an average of almost $5,280 per year, according to the report. The report’s authors called on policymakers to focus on expanding access to natural gas and other cheaper, reliable sources of energy.

“We should be focusing on a common sense and realistic approach to make energy more affordable for everyone — including investing in reliable and affordable energy sources and avoiding money wasted on these rebate programs and subsidies for expensive and unreliable alternative energy,” said Paul Craney, the Fiscal Alliance’s executive director.

“This approach would lower costs for every household and business in Massachusetts — not just the ones who qualify for tax breaks,” he said.",https://www.cnhi.com/wp-content/themes/cnhi/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-29 06:57:19.821542
,EPA,2025-11-29 10:11:16+00:00,mariettatimes.com,MOV Climate Corner: W.Va. residents deserve answers - Marietta Times,Not Available,,,,,https://www.mariettatimes.com/life/local-columns-life/2025/11/mov-climate-corner-w-va-residents-deserve-answers/,"Residents of West Virginia are seeking answers to their questions about proposed data centers/ power plants in their communities.
There has been a sharp increase nationally in communities’ resistance to host a data center.
Data Center Watch, a company that tracks data center opposition, found from May 2024 to March 2025, local opposition had blocked or delayed a total of $64 billion in data center projects, with six blocked entirely and 10 delayed.
Carbon capture and sequestration is a relatively new technology used to sequester carbon dioxide emissions.
The carbon dioxide will be collected via an absorption process, compressed, and then injected into Class VI injection wells.","Residents of West Virginia are seeking answers to their questions about proposed data centers/ power plants in their communities. These include a 500-acre data center in Tucker County, the 150-acre ammonia plant and 200,000-square-foot data center which are part of the Adams Fork Energy project on the Logan-Mingo county line, and the Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) project in Mason County. The center proposed in Mason County will “include a power plant, hydrogen production facility, carbon dioxide storage facility, and data center complex.”

There are no federal regulations concerning data centers. However, “in April, Gov. Patrick Morrisey signed House Bill 2014, a law designed to ease in-state data center development in part by prohibiting counties and municipalities from enforcing or adopting regulations that limit creation, development, or operation of any certified microgrid district or high-impact data center project.” Morrisey hailed HB 2014 as the economic development highlight of the West Virginia Legislature’s 2025 regular legislative session.

Unlike politicians, citizens in the state are not convinced that these centers will bring significant economic prosperity to the region. There has been a sharp increase nationally in communities’ resistance to host a data center. Data Center Watch, a company that tracks data center opposition, found from May 2024 to March 2025, local opposition had blocked or delayed a total of $64 billion in data center projects, with six blocked entirely and 10 delayed. From March to June of 2025, $98 billion worth of projects were blocked or delayed. There were over 1,600 citizen comments and most were against the gas turbine-powered data center operation in Tucker County.

Citizens are worried about several issues when it comes to data enters: increases in energy costs, increases in water usage, exposure to toxic substances, and loss of jobs due to Artificial Intelligence (AI). Some projections show that data center energy consumption could double or triple by 2028, accounting for up to 12% of U.S. electricity use. About 56 percent of the electricity used to power data centers is sourced from fossil fuels, and for our region that will mean more fracking for methane gas. Significant amounts of water are needed for cooling purposes. “A study by the International Energy Agency estimates for illustration that a 100-megawatt U.S. data center would consume roughly the same amount of water as 2,600 households.” Additionally, these data centers also use large quantities of PFAS-gas or f-gas chemicals in the cooling phase and in manufacturing some semiconductors. These compounds have been linked to cancer, birth defects, decreased immunity, high cholesterol, kidney disease, and a range of other serious health problems. Finally, citizens fear job losses as AI takes over many entry level positions. “Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said in a May Axios interview that AI could eliminate half of all entry-level, white-collar jobs within the next five years.”

President Trump is considering an executive order directing the Justice Department to override local regulations and state control of data centers and AI.

The project in Mason County is a “Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage,” and will span 2300 acres when completed and will be powered by burning wood chips. The air permit states 106 tons of wood chips per hour will be combusted. The first question that might come to mind is what trees will be cleared to supply 106 tons per hour? Possibly from the Wayne National Forest which is located just across the river in Ohio.

The air permit for Mason County, which has already been submitted to the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection, shows the levels of hazardous air pollutants will be 24 tons per year. This plant, as well as the Mingo County facility, will be employing carbon dioxide capturing technology. According to a review of the permit for the Mason County plant, “The carbon capture unit has the potential to emit VOC and volatile organic hazardous air pollutants (HAPS) from the carbon capture unit. These HAPs emissions are in the form of nitrosamines, acetaldehyde, and formaldehyde.” These compounds are classified as probable human carcinogens.

Carbon capture and sequestration is a relatively new technology used to sequester carbon dioxide emissions. The carbon dioxide will be collected via an absorption process, compressed, and then injected into Class VI injection wells. Since these wells will be off-site, pipelines will be used to transport the supercritical fluid from the Mason site to the wells.

Currently, the United State Environmental Protection Agency is responsible for permitting Class VI wells. However, West Virginia is one of a few states that has applied for and received primacy to regulate Class VI wells at the state level. Part of the application process requires documented proof that public participation activities were solicited prior to submission of the permit application.

Carbon dioxide, a known asphyxiant, is a dense gas and considered to be hazardous by the OSHA Hazard Communications Standard (29 CFR). It is physiologically active, and affects circulation and breathing. It can accumulate in topographically low areas under conditions of low wind and can travel large distances when released from a ruptured pipeline. It is injected at 1000 psi and can expand to 500 times its volume when exposed to atmospheric pressures. This was evidenced in the pipeline rupture in Satartia, Miss., which sent 45 people to the hospital. How will the mostly volunteer fire departments in West Virginia be able to handle a pipeline break or a leaking Class VI well?

Once again, the communities of West Virginia are being targeted by big out-of-state industries that will make money at the expense of the environment and citizens’ health. Sadly, as usual, the state politicians are welcoming data centers and new power plants which means more extraction and water usage with a promise of questionable local jobs.

Green Amendments Could Fix That - Atmos Magazine,Atmos,,,,,https://atmos.earth/climate-solutions/the-us-constitution-left-out-nature-green-amendments-could-fix-that/,"It is a system that accepts and legalizes environmental pollution and degradation through regulatory reviews and permits.
Green Amendments further require that environmental rights be protected equitably for all communities, regardless of race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status.
Green Amendments empower people to raise their expectations of government and to advocate more firmly and confidently for environmental protection.
Currently, there are three states with constitutional Green Amendments in place: Pennsylvania, Montana, and New York.
Recognizing the need for transformational change when it comes to environmental protection, and inspired by the progress Green Amendments can and do achieve, over 20 additional states are working with Green Amendments for the Generations, the nonprofit I founded, to secure the powerful protections these Amendments offer.","Across the United States, our state and federal constitutions recognize and protect many cherished rights and freedoms: our right to free speech, to peaceably assemble, to the safety and sanctity of our property, and even to bear arms. But in an oversight of history, these constitutions typically do not recognize the right to drink clean water or breathe clean air, or the right to a safe climate and healthy environment. Instead, these fundamental human rights are entrusted to an imperfect political system in which money, power, and special interests often take precedence over justice and basic human needs—and in which partisan advantage is often more important than facts, science, or human life.

That’s why I believe it’s time to add a Green Amendment to every state constitution in the country.

Rather than recognize a constitutional entitlement to a clean, safe, and healthy environment, here in the U.S., we protect our environment through a patchwork system of legislation and regulation. These laws and regulations are created by a political system dominated by money, partisanship, and narrow concentrations of social and economic influence that actually benefit (financially or politically) from environmental degradation. The resulting system of environmental protection is fundamentally flawed.

Under this system, environmental pollution and degradation is something to be managed, moderated, or mitigated after the fact rather than recognized as a harm that can and should be prevented. It is a system that accepts and legalizes environmental pollution and degradation through regulatory reviews and permits. The law also contains many critical gaps in which environmental harms are not addressed until it is too late, or sometimes not addressed at all.

(For an example, look no further than PFAS, also known as forever chemicals: a man-made family of chemicals left unregulated for so long that they now permeate our environment and have found their way into our drinking water, food supply, and bodies, with devastating health and financial consequences.)

This approach means that when these laws fail to ensure needed environmental protections, impacted people generally have little recourse other than to protest or seek better candidates in the next political election, when it is often too late and irreparable damage has been done.

Moreover, this approach of “protection by statute” means that the burdens of environmental pollution—toxic air, contaminated water, and the growing impacts of the climate crisis—often fall most heavily on those whom the political process ignores. Historical and present-day inequities mean that the worst of these impacts are often concentrated in communities of color, Indigenous communities, and/or low-income communities. And the fact that even low levels of pollution disproportionately harm children, including those developing in utero, means that future generations often bear the brunt of this flawed system.

Not only is this approach—which places the burdens of environmental pollution on those it deliberately excludes from the political process—morally abhorrent; it is economically foolish. The near- and long-term effects of exposure to pollution makes us all more vulnerable to disease and economic hardship. Exposure to environmental contaminants causes a range of health harms that include asthma, heart disease, dementia, and cancers of all kinds. The cognitive effects of lead poisoning are perhaps best known, but polluted environments can have a myriad of lasting effects on a person’s learning abilities. The destruction of ecosystems around the country, as well as our climate more broadly, is subjecting our communities to the rising threat of floods, droughts, wildfires, disease, deadly heat, and more.

All of this costs us money through reduced human potential and economic activity, lost property values, resources required for emergency response services, disaster relief, and health care. At the same time, this environmental desecration deprives us of the emotional, physical, and psychological well-being that only time in nature can provide.

Environmental degradation also undermines our fundamental freedoms. Neurotoxins and other environmental contaminants undermine the right to a quality education, and the disproportionate impacts of water, air, and soil pollution undermine the right to equal treatment under the law. The right to fish, hunt, and trap found in many state constitutions is being stymied by the loss of healthy habitat and species decline caused by mistreatment of natural resources. The safety and sanctity of our homes, and the property rights to which we are constitutionally entitled, are undermined when pollution crosses property or state lines or climate change-fueled disasters destroy our towns and cities. And the health impacts of outdoor air pollution, including asthma attacks or heart conditions, limit our other fundamental rights.

As former Pennsylvania state Sen. Franklin Kury famously said, “Freedom of speech will be meaningless if we suffocate on polluted air.”

Constitutional Green Amendments transform this legal paradigm, adding overarching protections that explicitly empower our people and our government to more effectively protect the environment, while proactively preventing its degradation.

Green Amendments, as I have defined them, are constitutional amendments added to the Bill of Rights section of our state constitutions, which recognize and protect the inalienable rights of all people, including future generations, to pure water, clean air, a safe climate, and healthy environments. By virtue of their placement in these Bills of Rights (called a Declaration of Rights in some states) and their carefully crafted language, Green Amendments put environmental rights on an equal constitutional footing with other civil, human, and political rights.

As with these other fundamental freedoms, Green Amendments require all government officials within a state—elected, appointed, and regulatory, as well as those working at the state, county, or local level—to affirmatively consider environmental rights and prioritize their protection in all decision-making. Green Amendments further require that environmental rights be protected equitably for all communities, regardless of race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. And they require that natural resources be protected generationally, helping to ensure that future generations have the healthy environment they need to lead safe and prosperous lives.

Green Amendments empower people to raise their expectations of government and to advocate more firmly and confidently for environmental protection. When there is a legal gap in environmental protection or implementation that results in dangerous environmental harm, these amendments provide explicit constitutional language that can be relied upon to secure needed protection. When government officials fail to fulfill their constitutional duty, or when the laws as written, interpreted, and applied fail to honor the environmental rights of the people or the obligation of the government to protect the state’s natural resources, Green Amendments provide a powerful tool to compel protection in court.

When it comes to the environment, states have a tremendous amount of authority. While the federal government can obligate states to provide a basic level of environmental protection, states have the authority to do more to protect their residents. Passing a constitutional obligation on all government officials within a state to protect environmental rights equitably and preserve natural resources for both present and future generations can secure a higher level of environmental care than that afforded by federal law. While a federal Green Amendment will ultimately be needed in order to ensure our Congress, president, federal judges and regulatory agencies honor and protect our environmental rights, state-level constitutional action is especially meaningful and accessible in the near term.

Currently, there are three states with constitutional Green Amendments in place: Pennsylvania, Montana, and New York. In Pennsylvania, the amendment was used to restore the authority of local governments to protect residential communities from industrial fracking operations and to restore the obligation of fossil fuel fracking operations to comply with environmental protection standards. In Montana, it was the presence of a Green Amendment that allowed 16 youth to successfully restore the right and obligation of government officials to consider the climate-changing implications of their decisions. New York’s amendment is only a few years old, but it is already being used by communities to secure protection of their air, water, and public natural open spaces. Across the board, these amendments are being used to advance and secure people’s rights to drinking water free from toxic contamination, open space and the immense benefit it has for their communities, ecosystems and wildlife that enrich their lives, and farmland that’s free from contaminants that can render crops and livestock unusable.

Moreover, Green Amendments are being used to rein in and mitigate serious consequences that stem from air pollution and are helping corral industries like oil and gas that inflict devastating consequences on our people and environment. At the same time, these amendments provide powerful support to environmentally friendly industries, such as wind and solar, and can boost ecologically supportive development that provides jobs and bolsters economic prosperity.

Recognizing the need for transformational change when it comes to environmental protection, and inspired by the progress Green Amendments can and do achieve, over 20 additional states are working with Green Amendments for the Generations, the nonprofit I founded, to secure the powerful protections these Amendments offer.

The Green Amendment movement is a solution whose time has come, and it’s one that transcends political party, generation, race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status.

In a moment when many are disillusioned by U.S. politics and our government’s inability to achieve essential environmental protections, the Green Amendment movement is leveraging the most powerful tools our democracy has—our state and federal constitutions—to secure environmental rights, environmental justice, natural resources protection, and generational security. By passing Green Amendments in every state, we can make sure that our environment, our health, and our lives are protected for generations to come.",https://atmos.earth/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ATMOS12_A-Green-Amendment-for-Every-State_SilvanaTrevale_05_hor-1280x720.jpg,N,,2025-11-29 04:57:27.645356

In an effort to improve and prioritise energy efficiency while also reducing costs and emissions, Google is introducing its self-service Energy Assessment Tool (EAT). The platform is engineered to give facility managers the ability to perform preliminary energy assessments without requiring specialist expertise or incurring on-site expenses.

Many manufacturers could achieve substantial cost savings and emissions reductions through energy efficiency improvements, yet they often face barriers. These can include the high cost of engaging energy assessment consultants, limited capital for efficiency projects, and a lack of in-house energy management expertise.

Such challenges frequently prevent the implementation of simple high-impact projects. The EAT aims to break down these obstacles.

Accelerating climate action and cost reduction

To help overcome these challenges, EAT is offered as a free platform for manufacturing facility and plant managers. It is designed to identify energy-saving opportunities and accelerate progress toward both cost reductions and climate action.

The tool provides actionable insights without the need for deep energy management knowledge or expensive on-site assessments.

By inputting basic facility data, users can receive customised recommendations that cover more than 20 system areas, including air compressors, boilers, chillers, and lighting.

“We’re launching a tool that I wish I had access to early in my career as a sustainability leader,"" explains Kate Brandt, Chief Sustainability Officer at Google, on LinkedIn.

“By equipping our partners with the right resources we can accelerate progress reduce costs and build a more efficient and resilient supply chain for everyone.”

To support its adoption across key manufacturing regions, the tool is available in several languages, including Chinese (simplified and traditional), Thai, Vietnamese, and English. Individual supplier energy assessment data is kept secure and confidential.

The EAT is built and managed by a third party and has been reviewed by Google to ensure it meets stringent privacy and security standards. This allows suppliers to decide which partners to collaborate with and what summary data to share, such as total potential savings.

Wider sustainable energy goals

The tool is part of Google's broader strategy to integrate sustainable energy use across its operations and supply chain with a focus on energy, the circular economy, consumer hardware, water and nature.

As a large corporate buyer of clean energy, Google procures substantial volumes of renewable power while also investing in advanced nuclear, enhanced geothermal, and grid-enhancing technologies to support future innovation.

In 2020, Google launched its third decade of climate action, which included a target to reach net-zero emissions across its operations and value chain by 2030. This is supported by an ambition to run entirely on 24/7 carbon-free energy on every grid where Google operates.

Google also works to design out waste and increase material reuse in its data centres, which are among the most efficient in the world.

“The journey to a more sustainable future is a shared one,"" Google states.

Ohio’s energy bill HB15, which passed in May of this year, was stripped of several pro-solar provisions, including a community solar program.
This program would have helped poor communities access solar energy.
This could mean gas projects might get preferential treatment over true renewable energy projects when it comes to permits by the Ohio Power Siting Board.
Taxpayers will foot the bills for the environmental, economic, and health costs from Ohio’s refusal to embrace the real clean, green renewable energy sources: solar and wind.","Dear Editor,

Unlike our neighboring states of Michigan and Illinois, Ohio’s politicians have not embraced the economic and environmental benefits that solar and wind energy provide. Instead, Ohio’s politicians passed Senate Bill 52, where communities can effectively block solar and wind projects, something that communities cannot do when it comes to fossil fuel development.

Ohio’s energy bill HB15, which passed in May of this year, was stripped of several pro-solar provisions, including a community solar program. This program would have helped poor communities access solar energy.

During the past nine months, the Trump administration has mounted a blatant attack on renewable energy by rolling back environmental laws and policies favoring renewables, canceling incentives enacted in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, and halting projects even when in construction.

Just when you think you’ve heard it all, Ohio’s Republican politicians have yet again come up with another way to kill renewable energy projects and promote the non-renewable fossil fuel gas: methane. HB 294 would grant “clean energy status” to methane gas.

This could mean gas projects might get preferential treatment over true renewable energy projects when it comes to permits by the Ohio Power Siting Board.

Unlike solar and wind energy, methane is a climate changing gas itself, and when burned produces carbon dioxide, another climate changing gas. “Sen. George Lang, one of the Republican co-sponsors, said in committee that natural gas is a cleaner energy source than coal.” That’s not saying much. Sen. Mark Romanchuk, a Richland County Republican and co-sponsor, remarked that building the infrastructure needed for solar- and wind-produced emissions, but he conveniently failed to mention the emissions created to construct a well pad and all the infrastructure needed to support the process.

According to a report by the World Nuclear Association, comparison of life-cycle CO2 emissions from all energy sources shows that fracked gas produces the third highest amount of CO2 with 490 grams of CO2 per kW hr. Utility scale solar produces 48 grams, residential solar produces 41 and wind are the lowest life-cycle emitters at 11 grams per kW hr. The life-cycle emissions from fracked gas include those produced from the extraction process which includes the gas (drilling), well pad and road construction, petrochemicals used to frack, compression and transportation of gas to LNG facilities and export transportation out of the country.

Additionally, the fracking process also requires enormous amounts of water and produces millions of gallons or toxic radioactive brine. Harrison County saw 853 million gallons of surface water withdrawn for fracking in 2023. That represents 78% of the total water usage in the county. Wind and solar energy have a significantly lower carbon and water footprint. Calling fracked gas “clean” is laughable.

At the same time politicians are wanting to declare “fracked” gas clean, they are working on legislation (HB 170 and SB 136) to give the Ohio Department of Natural Resources primacy over carbon dioxide capture and sequestration Class VI wells.

If passed, millions of tons of carbon emissions will be injected underneath Ohio land.

Taxpayers will be paying the tax incentives of $85 per ton of industrial CO2 captured and stored, according to the One Big Beautiful Bill.

Both HB 170 and SB 136 tramp on private property rights by allowing “forced pooling,” which means that land owners could be forced into allowing the injection of carbon dioxide under their private property.

The next assault on property owners may be the construction of pipelines to carry carbon dioxide across the state from industrial facilities to the injection wells; planned for Carroll, Jefferson, and Harrison counties. Mid-western states have already seen significant pushbacks from land owners who are being forced to allow pipelines to cross their farms and communities via the use of eminent domain.

Iowa residents have been fighting Summit Carbon Solutions’ pipeline for several years. In addition, Summit Carbon Solutions’ planned route through South Dakota to North Dakota has been blocked as the company was banned from using eminent domain to take property.

Will Ohio’s citizens be dealing with this legal battle as Ohio politicians invite the CCS industry into the state?

Recently, S. 2975, the federal “PIPELINE Safety Act of 2025,” passed by voice vote. It is a bipartisan effort to reauthorize the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration’s safety programs until 2030. This law would also set regulations for carbon dioxide pipelines. Environmental groups worry that the industry has had too much influence and point out the deficiencies that could lead to another accident like the one that occurred in 2020 in Satartia, Mississippi, where 45 people were overcome by CO2 leaking from a ruptured pipeline. These concerns included: lack of odorization of CO2 so releases are detectable by smell; performance-based leak detection and rupture mitigation; contaminant controls to help prevent CO2 related corrosion; and prevention of the conversion of oil or gas pipelines to CO2 pipelines.

Taxpayers will foot the bills for the environmental, economic, and health costs from Ohio’s refusal to embrace the real clean, green renewable energy sources: solar and wind.

The U.S. Energy Association has said, “Wind and solar power are two of the fastest-growing energy sectors in the U.S. and produced as much as 17% of the country’s electricity last year.” Yet, Ohio politicians continue to push “dirty” fracked gas down our throats.

They are either willfully ignorant or out of touch with reality.

The United States electric commercial vehicle (ECV) market was valued at USD 13.88 Billion in 2024, and is expected to reach USD 55.92 Billion by 2030, rising at a CAGR of 26.41%. The market is experiencing robust growth due to rising environmental concerns, stringent emission regulations, and the growing adoption of clean energy solutions.

Businesses are prioritizing sustainability, driving the demand for ECVs across logistics, delivery, and public transportation sectors. Government incentives and subsidies, including tax credits for purchasing electric vehicles, have further propelled market expansion. According to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), there were over 12,000 electric medium- and heavy-duty vehicles operating in the U.S. as of Q4 2023. This includes delivery vans, trucks, and buses, reflecting a nearly 35% increase year-over-year in deployment.

The development of advanced battery technologies has enhanced vehicle efficiency and reduced operating costs, making ECVs increasingly attractive for commercial applications. The growing awareness of corporate social responsibility among companies encourages investments in cleaner fleet options. Key trends in the market include advancements in battery technology, such as solid-state batteries offering greater energy density and faster charging times.

The integration of smart connectivity features, including telematics and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication, is transforming fleet management and optimizing operational efficiency. Emerging technologies, such as hydrogen fuel cells, are also gaining traction, especially for long-haul commercial applications. The shift toward autonomous electric vehicles is creating opportunities for cost reduction and enhanced safety in logistics operations. Collaborations between automotive manufacturers and technology firms are accelerating innovation, while fleet electrification strategies by major logistics companies are bolstering market growth.

Market drivers

Government incentives and regulations

The United States has implemented a series of policies to accelerate the adoption of ECVs. Incentives such as tax credits, grants, and rebates for fleet operators and vehicle manufacturers reduce the upfront cost of adopting ECVs. Stringent emissions regulations encourage a shift away from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles.

The California Air Resources Board (CARB) and federal initiatives like the Zero-Emission Vehicle (ZEV) program mandate fleet electrification, making ECVs essential for regulatory compliance. These measures provide a stable demand for ECVs, particularly among logistics and public transportation operators seeking sustainable and regulatory-compliant solutions. For instance, in 2023 leasing models allowed electric cars to qualify for relaxed commercial vehicle tax credits. Savings were passed to leaseholders, boosting EV adoption. This strategy supported sustained rollouts.

Key market challenges

High upfront costs

The initial cost of electric commercial vehicles remains a barrier despite declining battery prices. ECVs are generally more expensive than their ICE counterparts due to the cost of advanced batteries and associated technologies. Fleet operators often face budget constraints that make the transition to ECVs challenging, particularly for small businesses.

Even with incentives, the total cost of ownership (TCO) calculation, factoring in charging infrastructure and maintenance, can deter adoption. Addressing these financial barriers requires scalable production and economies of scale to further reduce manufacturing costs.

Key market trends

Adoption of electric delivery vans and trucks

The increasing focus on last-mile delivery efficiency is driving the adoption of electric delivery vans and trucks. Companies in the logistics and retail sectors are prioritizing these vehicles for urban deliveries to reduce emissions and operational costs.

According to the North American Council for Freight Efficiency (NACFE), electric delivery vans used by fleets such as FedEx and UPS demonstrated 30% to 50% lower total cost of ownership (TCO) compared to internal combustion vehicles in urban use cases.

“Over the past few months, several elements of the climate action plan I worked on as Minister of the Environment have been, or are about to be, dismantled,” he said.
“The pipeline to BC would have to cross some of the most challenging terrain in Canada.","First Nations groups backed by environmental and conservationist allies in Canada are denouncing a pipeline and tanker infrastructure agreement announced Thursday between Liberal Prime Minister Mark Carney and Conservative Alberta Premier Danielle Smith, calling the deal a betrayal and promising to fight against its implementation tooth and nail.

“We will use every tool in our toolbox to ensure that this pipeline does not go ahead,” said Heiltsuk Nation Chief Marilyn Slett in response to the Carney-Smith deal that would bring tens of millions of barrels of tar sands oil from Alberta to the coast of British Columbia for export by building new pipeline and lifting a moratorium against oil tankers operating in fragile British Columbia coastal water.

While Carney, who argues that the pipeline is in Canada’s economic interest, had vowed to secure the support of First Nations before finalizing any agreement with the Alberta, furious reactions to the deal made it clear that promise was not met.

Xhaaidlagha Gwaayaai, the president of the Haida nation, was emphatic: “This project is not going to happen.”

The agreement, according to the New York Times, is part of Carney’s “plan to curb Canada’s trade dependence on the United States, swings Canadian policy away from measures meant to fight climate change to focus instead on growing the oil and gas industry.”

In a statement, the Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs (UBCIC) “loudly” voiced its opposition to the memorandum of understanding signed by Carney and Smith.

“This MOU is nothing less than a high risk and deeply irresponsible agreement that sacrifices Indigenous peoples, coastal communities, and the environment for political convenience,” said Grand Chief Stewart Phillip, president of the UBCIC. “By explicitly endorsing a new bitumen pipeline to BC’s coast and promising to rewrite the Oil Tanker Moratorium Act, the federal government is resurrecting one of the most deeply flawed and divisive ideas in Canadian energy politics.”

Slett, who serves as secretary-treasurer of the UBCIC, said the agreement “was negotiated without the involvement of the very Nations who would shoulder those risks, and to suggest ‘Indigenous co-ownership’ of a pipeline while ignoring the clear opposition of Coastal First Nations is unacceptable.”

Avi Lewis, running for the leadership of the progressive New Democratic Party (NDP) in upcoming elections, decried the agreement as a failure of historic proportions.

“Carney’s deal with Danielle Smith is the sellout of the century: scrapping climate legislation for a pipeline that will never be built,” said Lewis, a veteran journalist and climate activist. “We need power lines, not pipelines. Our path is through climate leadership and building good jobs in the clean economy.”

In response to the deal, the minister of Canadian culture, Steven Guilbeault, who formerly served as environment minister under the previous Liberal administration, resigned in protest.

“Despite this difficult economic context, I remain one of those for whom environmental issues must remain front and center,” Guilbeault said in a statement.

“Over the past few months, several elements of the climate action plan I worked on as Minister of the Environment have been, or are about to be, dismantled,” he said. “In my view, these measures remain essential to our climate action plan.”

David Eby, the premier of British Columbia who opposes the new pipeline into his province and was not included in the discussions between Carney and Smith, echoed those who said the project is more dead than alive, despite the MOU, calling it a potential “energy vampire” that would distracts from better energy solutions that don’t carry all the baggage of this proposed project.

“With all of the variables that have yet to be fulfilled — no proponent, no route, no money, no First Nations support — that it cannot draw limited federal resources, limited Indigenous governance resources, limited provincial resources away from the real projects that will employ people,” Eby added.

Keith Brooks, the programs director at Environmental Defence, decried the deal as “worse than we had anticipated” and “a gift to the oil industry and Alberta Premier Smith, at the expense of practically everyone else.”

“Filling this pipeline and expansion would require more oil sands mining, leading to more carbon pollution, more tailings, and worse impacts for communities near the tar sands,” warned Brooks. “The pipeline to BC would have to cross some of the most challenging terrain in Canada. The impacts of construction would be severe, and the impacts of a spill, devastating.”

Jessica Green, a professor at the University of Toronto with a focus on environmental politics, equated the “reckless” deal to a “climate dumpster fire” and called the push for more tar sands pipelines in Canada “the energy equivalent [of] investing in VHS tapes in 2025.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2248007232-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-29 12:02:42.880368

The U.S. government has oil reserves in large underground salt caverns at four sites along the Gulf coast: two each in Texas and Louisiana. President Gerald Ford established the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in 1975 to shield the U.S. from oil shortages in an energy crisis.

The DOE announced winning suppliers on Nov. 12 for both contracts totaling $55.7 million. Deliveries are to start from Dec. 1 through Jan. 31 at the Bryan Mound SPR in Texas. The agency stated that six companies submitted 18 offers to supply the crude oil.

“President Trump promised to protect America’s energy security by refilling and managing the Strategic Petroleum Reserve more responsibly,” U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, noted in a press statement. “Awarding these contracts marks another step in the important process of refilling this national security asset. While this process won’t be complete overnight, these actions are an important step in strengthening our energy security and reversing the costly and irresponsible energy policies of the last administration.”

The largest contract (for some 600 million barrels) went to Trafigura Trading LLC (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Trafigura Group Pte Ltd). The other DOE contract was signed for 300 million barrels with Energy Transfer Crude Marketing LLC.

West Hockberry—in Cameron Parish, 25 miles southwest of Lake Charles, La., and

Bayou Choctaw—in Iberville Parish, 12 miles southwest of Baton Rouge, La.

“Decisions to withdraw crude oil in the event of an energy emergency are made by the President under the authority of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act and done through a competitive sale. The SPR is always drawdown-ready, which means it stands ready to release crude oil to the market within 13 days of Presidential direction; this is the time it takes to conduct the sales process, award contracts and to arrange the logistics for oil transportation,” according to DOE.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/692a624bc926253a1cf05745/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-11-28 22:58:13.849635

After conducting surveys across the city with a special focus on the west side, which disproportionately experiences the effects of pollution, the city found that Salt Lakers’ top environmental concerns are drought and air quality.
Salt Lake City is in the top three metro areas in the country for urban heat island intensity, with the west side of the city feeling those effects more strongly, Wyffels said.
Seasons in Salt Lake City are getting hotter, Nicholas said.
Utah has also criticized the federal air quality regulations, even disputing Environmental Protection Agency air quality rules in court.","While the federal government steps away from climate agreements, Salt Lake City is reiterating its commitment to become more sustainable ahead of the 2034 Olympic Games with a 2040 deadline to achieve goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution.

In an update presented to the Salt Lake City Council on Tuesday, the city’s Sustainability Department highlighted milestones, including a major one — the city’s greenhouse gas emissions fell 11% from 2009 to 2024, said Catherine Wyffels, air quality and environmental program manager at the department.

“This is primarily due to a shift to cleaner energy sources,” Wyffels said in a presentation. “So while this 11% may not seem like much, it’s important to remember that it happened during a period of a lot of growth.”

Per capita emissions also declined 25% in the same period, she said. But there’s still a long way to go to meet the city’s climate goals.

After conducting surveys across the city with a special focus on the west side, which disproportionately experiences the effects of pollution, the city found that Salt Lakers’ top environmental concerns are drought and air quality.

“People are interested in anything they can do in their homes to save under utility bills,” she said. “A lot of support for clean renewable energy for both homes and businesses. People like street trees in their neighborhoods, and then also a lot of support for increased access to transit, walking and biking infrastructure.”

All of those are solutions to the city’s primary climate risks, which according to the Sustainability Department, are driven by rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns.

The report presented to the City Council is still preliminary and is scheduled for an update next spring. Whenever it’s done, the city hopes it can help trace a path to achieve its goal to be 100% powered by renewable energy by 2030 and cutting 80% of emissions by 2040.

Salt Lake City is in the top three metro areas in the country for urban heat island intensity, with the west side of the city feeling those effects more strongly, Wyffels said. Urban development amid continued growth is expected to exacerbate the issue.

The city’s sustainability department also highlighted some achievements including an 80-megawatt solar farm that provides a lot of the city’s municipal energy and has saved around $1.5 million in electricity bills, said Sophia Nicholas, deputy director at the city’s Sustainability Department.

“We have a lot of the solutions at hand. We just need to have the wherewithal, political will, money, to implement them on a global basis,” Nicholas said. “And it is happening actually in other countries, but when you’re looking at our emissions profile in Salt Lake City in particular, about half of it comes from electricity, and that’s why it’s been so exciting to see that we have realized a reduction in our electric grid carbon intensity due to investments in a cleaner grid.”

Despite the progress there are still some issues. Seasons in Salt Lake City are getting hotter, Nicholas said. In the last 50 years, the average temperature in Utah has risen more than 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit, about twice the global average.

“That may not sound like much,” she said during the meeting, “but a few degrees change in the average temperature means our city and our region is and will continue to experience increasing drought, wildfires, flooding, extreme heat days and poor air quality.”

The city met federal air quality standards

For 15 years Salt Lake City and Provo, some of the densest cities in Utah were nonattainment areas for the Environmental Protection Agency’s 24-hour standards for fine particular matter pollution known as PM2.5. This month, however, the federal agency announced both municipalities were finally in compliance.

“The achievement of cleaner air in Utah resulted from extensive planning and collaboration among the public, industry, and various government levels, leading to significant investments and the implementation of 23 new rules targeting emissions from multiple sources,” Bryce Bird, director at the Utah Division of Air Quality, said in a statement.

He pointed to some efforts supported by the state Legislature, including incentives for retrofitting and replacing high-emission wood stoves and diesel vehicles, as well as transit updates and education campaigns.

However, in terms of energy, the state also modified its policy in 2024 to consider energy resources by listing these attributes in order of priority: adequate, reliable, dispatchable, affordable, sustainable, secure and clean. That law worried environmentalists, who said it could lead to the prioritization of coal and move the state away from a strong market of renewables.

Utah has also criticized the federal air quality regulations, even disputing Environmental Protection Agency air quality rules in court.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/120624_Air-Quality_05-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-11-29 00:58:23.083099

And our two freeports, in Anglesey and South Wales, are helping to attract investment with tax incentives, streamlined customs processes and sites ready for development.
In all, Wales is home to more than 5,000 manufacturing companies, with a workforce of over 150,000 people.
Since 2019, AMRC Cymru in North Wales – part of the University of Sheffield’s Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre – has been harnessing world-leading research to transform how the industry works.
South Wales is soon to have a new innovation hub of its own.","Wales is a nation built on enterprise and innovation. Our coal mines once fuelled the Industrial Revolution, and Welsh smelting works produced more copper than anywhere else on earth. Slate from our quarries roofed the world, from New York to New South Wales.

In the 20th century, manufacturing and heavy industry shared the stage with new forms of enterprise. Wales became known for precision engineering and high-tech electronics, welcoming some of the biggest corporations from Europe, America and the Far East.

Today, Wales has become a unique business environment where collaboration drives success. Our high-growth industries enjoy close partnership with eight world-class universities, and the support of a devolved government that can make things happen at speed.

What’s more, Wales was the first nation to pass legislation protecting the rights of future generations. Sustainability is at the heart of all our priority sectors, including renewable energy, life sciences, compound semiconductors, technology, advanced manufacturing and the creative industries.

It’s quite a journey from the furnaces of our copperworks to the spotlessly clean rooms where the world’s most advanced semiconductors are made. But however much our industries change, the fundamentals are the same: Wales is a place where talent thrives, and ideas can take flight.

Coal powered our past, but our future lies in renewable energy – from the wind, from the waves, and from cleanly generated hydrogen. Just as Wales once sent its anthracite around the world, we’re now a net exporter of electricity.

Our 1,200km coastline is ideal for offshore wind generation, with three sites already operational. By 2030, wind will power four million households, creating 29,000 jobs and a £4.5billion economic impact.

We’ve developed the infrastructure to help energy innovators harness our abundant natural resources. Our marine test zones are valuable proving grounds for technologies that could help meet the world’s future energy needs, such as tidal power. And our two freeports, in Anglesey and South Wales, are helping to attract investment with tax incentives, streamlined customs processes and sites ready for development.

Compound semiconductors are vital to artificial intelligence, self-driving vehicles, advanced medical devices – even the smartphone in your pocket.

Many of the chips are developed and manufactured in Wales, a nation with 40 years of semiconductor expertise. We’re home to the world’s first compound semiconductor cluster: a tight ecosystem of tech companies and specialist research centres, collaborating under the name of CSconnected.

Its capabilities make Wales a semiconductor one-stop shop, with businesses that span the entire supply chain – from wafer production and chip processing to equipment manufacturing and packaging, all in a concentrated area of South East Wales.

Our approach attracts top global players. In 2025, KLA opened a new 237,000 square foot R&D and manufacturing facility in Newport, supplying chip fabrication equipment to the world. Just five miles away, Vishay operates the UK’s largest semiconductor manufacturing plant.

Life sciences is the umbrella term for the study of living organisms and processes – and the use of this knowledge to improve people's lives.

More than 300 life sciences companies are tackling today’s healthcare challenges in Wales. They represent a vast range of specialisms, from genomics and advanced diagnostics to medical imaging – but all of them benefit from industry networks that tie the sector together.

For 30 years, MediWales has served as an independent life science network for Wales, connecting universities, businesses, care providers and the clinical community. Life Sciences Hub Wales, based in Cardiff, is another beacon of cross-sector co-operation, helping to develop the most promising breakthroughs for frontline use.

The Welsh Government is a vital spoke in our ecosystem, with national programmes in genomics, pathology, imaging and advanced therapies. Wales also has its own devolved National Health Service, granting access to high-quality anonymised healthcare data.

All this has earned Wales a global reputation in fast-moving markets such as medtech, diagnostics, regenerative medicine and cell therapy. It’s now a sector worth £2.8 billion, employing a skilled workforce of 13,000 people.

Wales has one of the fastest-growing digital economies outside London. Our tech sector is worth an estimated £8.5 billion, providing jobs for around 13,000 people. From challenger banks to cybersecurity innovators, it’s a dynamic, collaborative ecosystem.

Our universities are key partners, providing research and development capability, generating spin-out companies, and producing graduates with the skills to keep the sector growing.

More than 30 incubators and accelerators transform ideas into thriving businesses. They include Tramshed Tech, which provides start-ups with flexible workspaces, mentoring and digital skills. The networking community FinTech Wales connects new businesses with both expertise and investment.

Indeed, FinTech is particularly strong in Wales – partly thanks to a buoyant financial services sector that employs more than 63,000 people. We’re a global leader in cybersecurity, too, with active North and South Wales cyber clusters and more than 150 companies developing the capabilities to protect critical computer systems.

Wales manufactures for the world. We export aircraft wings to France, cable systems to Japan, air conditioning units to the Middle East, and many more advanced products and components destined for markets around the globe.

In all, Wales is home to more than 5,000 manufacturing companies, with a workforce of over 150,000 people. Key subsectors include aerospace, automotive, precision engineering and robotics.

While manufacturing is anchored in our industrial heritage, it’s among our most forward-looking sectors. Since 2019, AMRC Cymru in North Wales – part of the University of Sheffield’s Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre – has been harnessing world-leading research to transform how the industry works.

South Wales is soon to have a new innovation hub of its own. The Global Centre of Rail Excellence will research and test out the technologies to build tomorrow’s railway networks – making transport better, faster and more sustainable throughout the UK and Europe.

Wales has graced the screen in international hits ranging from Doctor Who and Sherlock to His Dark Materials and Sex Education. Behind the camera, our film and TV industry is thriving, with world-class facilities to match our beautiful locations.

More than 90,000 people work in the creative industries, producing an annual turnover of £3.8 billion. They’re supported by Creative Wales, established by the Welsh Government to drive growth in film, TV, music, gaming and digital arts.

Our production facilities, such as Wolf Studios in Cardiff, can accommodate the greatest feats of imagination. They’re served by a constellation of specialists, dealing with everything from lighting hire to set design, post-production and VFX. And digital arts are booming, with games from independent developers like Wales Interactive entertaining millions around the world.",https://www.wales.com/sites/wales/files/styles/o_herostandard_fullwidth_xl_min_2x/public/media-library/2025-11/25893-n131-330-d-web-optimised-1920px.jpg.webp?itok=6w2CC8DS,N,,2025-11-29 05:58:36.860008

Three points of concerns included “unprecedented staffing crisis,” the Congressional Review Act (CRA) and proposed land sales.
The staffing crisis that BLM faces under the Trump administration was said to slows down planning and permitting processes.
“Senators also heard how the Bureau of Land Management is facing an unprecedented staffing crisis due to the Trump administration’s cuts,” Hamby said.
“Congress needs to step up on behalf of our public lands and ensure BLM has the people and funding to do its job and steward these lands for future generations,” Hamby said.","On Nov. 19, a recent Senate hearing regarding the multiple-use mandate of America’s public lands was held by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. The core issue discussed was about the challenge of balancing the “multiple-use” mandate (which requires balancing recreation, conservation, timber, grazing, and energy development) with a “sustained yield.”

Many senators and witnesses expressed frustration with the current process, calling it “rigid, slow, and often detached from the intent Congress expressed” and subject to political shifts between administrations.

“Senators heard one consistent message today: Multiple use is hard,” Rachael Hamby, policy director at The Center for Western Priorities, said. “Finding the balance happens on the ground, with the residents, scientists, and small business owners who know the land the best. That’s why it’s so foolish for Congress to use a blunt instrument like the Congressional Review Act to impose land management decisions from Washington.

The staffing crisis that BLM faces under the Trump administration was said to slows down planning and permitting processes.

“Senators also heard how the Bureau of Land Management is facing an unprecedented staffing crisis due to the Trump administration’s cuts,” Hamby said.

Recent use of the CRA by Congress to overturn three specific resource management plans was noted as potentially causing “chaos” and uncertainty in land management, as it calls into question the validity of numerous other land use plans and decisions. Some Republican senators, including Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), have proposed selling off millions of acres of public land to address housing shortages and national debt, a measure that has faced significant opposition.

Ucore Rare Metals is positioning itself as a key enabler of Western supply-chain sovereignty.
This substantial government investment underscores the strategic importance of developing domestic rare earth processing capabilities outside Chinese control.
This approach addresses the fundamental vulnerability in Western supply chains that has become increasingly apparent as China asserts greater control over rare earth exports.
The Department of Defense funding signals both the urgency and strategic priority placed on developing alternative supply chains for these essential materials.","A tectonic shift in the global minerals landscape has crystallized as China’s Ministry of Commerce announced this month that it is expanding export controls over key rare-earth elements and related processing equipment, marking a strategic tightening of Beijing’s dominance. In the face of this disruption, Ucore Rare Metals is ramping up its U.S.-based capabilities to build an independent supply chain of rare earths through its patented RapidSX technology and strategic partners.

Ucore Rare Metals is positioning itself as a key enabler of Western supply-chain sovereignty. In May 2025 the company announced a $18.4 million funding agreement with the U.S. Department of Defense to scale its RapidSX rare-earth separation technology toward commercial production at its Strategic Metals Complex in Alexandria, Louisiana. This substantial government investment underscores the strategic importance of developing domestic rare earth processing capabilities outside Chinese control.

The company has also taken steps to secure feedstock and expand partnerships, which are critical in the rare-earth arena where refining capacity—not just mining—is the choke point. By manufacturing in Louisiana, sourcing from allied feed-stock jurisdictions and avoiding reliance on Chinese equipment and supply chains, the company aligns with the West’s push for resilience in critical minerals. This approach addresses the fundamental vulnerability in Western supply chains that has become increasingly apparent as China asserts greater control over rare earth exports.

Ucore’s broader corporate strategy includes disrupting the People’s Republic of China’s control of the North American REE supply chain through the near-term development of a heavy and light rare-earth processing facility in Louisiana, with subsequent strategic metals complexes planned for Canada and Alaska. The company maintains additional information about its operations and strategic direction available through its corporate website at https://www.Ucore.com. Additional news and updates relating to the company are accessible through their newsroom at https://ibn.fm/UURAF.

The timing of Ucore’s expansion coincides with growing geopolitical tensions and increasing recognition among Western governments that rare earth elements—essential for defense technologies, electric vehicles, and renewable energy systems—represent a critical national security vulnerability when concentrated in a single supplier nation. The Department of Defense funding signals both the urgency and strategic priority placed on developing alternative supply chains for these essential materials.",https://www.citybuzz.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/favicon-65x65.png,N,,2025-11-29 15:00:33.054695

Opportunities to capture semiconductor back-end work, EV battery manufacturing and higher-value electronics are real.","(MENAFN- Asia Times) ASEAN is attempting to secure a foothold in the global semiconductor and electric-vehicle battery industries. Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand have each announced concrete industrial commitments that signal an ambition to move deeper into high-value manufacturing.

These efforts carry strategic implications because semiconductors, power electronics and batteries are essential inputs for artificial intelligence, renewable energy systems and modern defense industries. The region now faces a growing set of geopolitical and engineering pressures that directly affect planned projects, cost structures and national industrial strategies.

This analysis documents the most significant national developments in 2024 and 2025, outlines precise vulnerabilities and provides realistic mitigation measures for decision makers.

Strategic context

In October 2025 China announced additional controls on rare-earth exports and related processing technologies. This decision briefly tightened the market for rare-earth magnets and separated oxides that are crucial for EV motors and semiconductor equipment. Although Beijing later delayed parts of the policy's implementation, the message was clear: Critical inputs can be restricted with little warnin.

Meanwhile, the United States and its allies have continued adjusting export controls on chipmaking equipment. Any further tightening will directly affect the cost and feasibility of new packaging and test facilities across ASEAN. The strategic environment surrounding high technology has therefore become volatile and has placed pressure on firms hoping to expand into advanced electronics production.

Malaysia: advanced packing ambitions

Malaysia is pursuing one of the most aggressive semiconductor-upgrade strategies in Southeast Asia. Penang's“Silicon Island” project and the new Green Tech Park represent a deliberate shift from assembly to higher-value packaging and design.

Approved semiconductor-related investments reportedly exceeded 70 billion ringgit ($17 billion) between January 2024 and June 2025. Investments include Infineon's silicon carbide expansion and Carsem's advanced packaging facilities for AI-related chips.

Advanced-packaging and testing lines in Malaysia's semiconductor clusters still depend on specialized lithography subsystems, ultra-high-purity precursor chemicals and precision metrology equipment.

These imports are increasingly vulnerable because Malaysia's new export-control regime now requires notifications for high-performance AI chips and equipment, creating possible bottlenecks and compliance burdens.

Latest stories A familiar quiet: Prabowo and the return of managed dissent New weapons emerging to counter and zap drone power South Korea's grand plan to join the AI big time

For example, Malaysia's July 202 directive requires exporters to notify authorities at least 30 days in advance when shipping US-origin high-performance AI chips, signaling that regulatory headwinds may also apply upstream in tool and component supply chains.

Without expedited import lanes, delays in receiving critical equipment would postpone factory commissioning in locations such as Penang, driving up capital costs through extended financing periods.

The Malaysian government must fast-track customs and import lanes for critical equipment, co-finance spare-parts pools for fabs and invest in infrastructure near semiconductor clusters such as high-quality water, power reliability and waste-treatment.

In parallel, public-private training centers should train large numbers of precision-manufacturing engineers.

Indonesia: nickel dominance, battery dream

Indonesia has leveraged its dominant nickel reserves to pull in major EV battery investments. The flagship project is the nearly $6 billion joint venture between Contemporary Amperex Technology Company (CATL) and Indonesia Battery Corporation in West Java.

A June 2025 Reuters report said the facility is scheduled to begin operations by late 2026 with an initial capacity of 6.9 GWh, with an expansion path toward 15 GWh or more. The scale demonstrates Indonesia's ambition to anchor the region's battery ecosystem, but it also highlights the limits of upstream advantage.

Despite controlling the raw material, Indonesia's battery value chain is not yet integrated. The CATL–IBC project will still depend heavily on imported precursor chemicals, cathode active materials and high-precision manufacturing equipment.

The Reuters report noted that while Indonesia has rapidly expanded nickel processing, the country has not built the full suite of midstream capabilities required for stable cell production. Critical reagents and machinery remain tied to suppliers in China, South Korea and Japan.

This dependency introduces substantial strategic risk. A February 2025 C4ADS repor found that Chinese companies control roughly 75% of Indonesia's nickel-refining capacity.

That concentration means that although production occurs on Indonesian soil, operational control, technology flows and strategic decisions often originate in external corporate or policy environments. Any shift in Chinese domestic policy, export priorities or commercial strategy could ripple through Indonesia's downstream battery plans and disrupt cell production timelines.

Given these vulnerabilities, Indonesia must accelerate development of domestic precursor and cathode-material facilities to reduce exposure to foreign suppliers. Battery-plant construction should also be sequenced with upgrades to grid capacity, wastewater management and environmental controls, since these engineering systems remain bottlenecks in several industrial zones.

Manufacturers should also design production lines with modularity so they can switch battery chemistries if global markets or reagent availability change.

Thailand: EV hub conversion

Thailand is moving quickly to convert its dominant automotive industry into an electric-vehicle hub. The Board of Investment's EV 3.5 package, announced in 2025, offers tax incentives, consumer subsidies and import-duty relief through 2027 for manufacturers that commit to local production.

This policy has already shifted investment patterns. BYD opened a $490 million plant in Rayong in mid-2025 with capacity for 150,000 EVs annually, marking one of the largest EV manufacturing commitments in Southeast Asia. Domestic EV registrations also surge to roughly 70,000 units in 2024, up from fewer than 10,000 in 2021.

Despite these gains, Thailand's EV ecosystem remains dependent on imported battery cells, semiconductor components and rare-earth magnets. ASEAN Briefing's September 2025 assessment found that Thailand still lacks mid-stream capabilities such as cathode production, electrolyte processing and advanced battery-testing facilities. This dependence exposes the sector to the same vulnerabilities faced by regional semiconductor clusters.

These components also move through logistics systems designed for traditional automotive supply chains. Laem Chabang Port remains optimized for bulk auto parts rather than high-value lithium-ion cells.

EV assemblers reported delays in 2025 due to congestion and manual customs checks on sensitive components during peak export periods. Even minor slowdowns disrupt just-in-time assembly and raise operational costs.

To protect its emerging EV advantage, Thailand must expand bonded logistics zones for battery components, accelerate port digitization and cooperate with ASEAN partners to harmonize battery standards. Without these measures, Thailand's EV ambitions will remain vulnerable to supply-chain friction and regulatory fragmentation.

Regional Risk Map

Material concentration risk. China's export controls on rare earths and magnets create leverage points. ASEAN must map critical-element dependencies and invest in regional recycling and stockpiles.

Equipment and technology risk. Restrictive export regimes on chip-making tools raise project execution risk. ASEAN governments should establish pooled spare-parts procurement, trusted procurement corridors and diplomatic waiver channels.

Infrastructure and skills risk. All three countries face co-investment needs in power, water, waste and vocational training aligned with advanced manufacturing. ASEAN-level funding mechanisms and mutual recognition of professional certifications would reduce friction. Sign up for one of our free newsletters

ASEAN stands at a pivotal moment. Opportunities to capture semiconductor back-end work, EV battery manufacturing and higher-value electronics are real. Malaysia's move into advanced packaging, Indonesia's downstream battery strategy and Thailand's EV pivot are promising.

They are also fragile. Each depends on imported tools, materials and specialized skills that can be disrupted by geopolitical shifts.

The region's success will depend on how quickly leaders can reduce those vulnerabilities through strategic infrastructure investment, targeted industrial policy, regional standardization and coordinated risk management.

Without these measures, factories across ASEAN will remain profitable in calm markets but exposed during periods of geopolitical tumult.

The two nations also agreed to co-host the first ever International Conference on the Just Transition Away from Fossil Fuels, scheduled for April 2026.
“There is a clear momentum to phase out fossil fuels, and now is the time to capitalise on it,” said Sophie Hermans, the Dutch minister for climate.
This is a major milestone.” Under the North Sea Future Plan, small amounts of fossil fuels will still be able to be extracted at or near existing wells.
Campaigners said that it will result in relatively small amounts of fossil fuels being extracted.","Nations hatched a plan to abandon fossil fuels

After the Cop30 climate summit concluded with zero mention of fossil fuels in the draft text, Colombia and the Netherlands pledged to establish their own roadmap for abandoning oil, gas and coal – with the backing of 22 other nations, including Australia and the UK.

While there was a lack of consensus on fossil fuels at Cop30 – a victory for obstructive petrostates – around a third of nations backed phasing them out. Colombia and the Netherlands were among them, and announced that they would independently establish a roadmap for abandoning fossil fuels. The two nations also agreed to co-host the first ever International Conference on the Just Transition Away from Fossil Fuels, scheduled for April 2026.

“There is a clear momentum to phase out fossil fuels, and now is the time to capitalise on it,” said Sophie Hermans, the Dutch minister for climate. “We must begin to materialise what this phaseout could look like and start a concrete roadmap that allows us to incorporate the new and leave the old behind.”

The breakaway conference comes as critics question whether the Cop process is fit for purpose, having struggled to enact significant change since the Paris agreement was signed at Cop21 in 2015.

Speaking of abandoning fossil fuels …

The UK has become the first major economy to call time on new fossil fuel exploration, confirming that no more licenses for oil and gas drilling will be issued in the North Sea.

“Britain has just made history,” said Greenpeace UK’s co-executive director, Areeba Hamid. “Closing the door to new exploration marks the beginning of the end of oil and gas in this country. The government has shown genuine global climate leadership. This is a major milestone.”

Under the North Sea Future Plan, small amounts of fossil fuels will still be able to be extracted at or near existing wells. The government argued that this would support the UK’s energy transition. Campaigners said that it will result in relatively small amounts of fossil fuels being extracted.

Despite welcoming the announcement, Hamid said that “the current plan – and cash – to support North Sea workers doesn’t go far enough”. She added: “It’s vital they are at the heart of Britain’s transition to a clean-energy superpower, not left behind by it. A £20m jobs package doesn’t cut the mustard.”

Monthly injection shown to relieve severe asthma

People who take daily steroid tablets for severe asthma could soon have a new treatment option after a new jab showed “incredibly encouraging” results in a trial.

For the trial, King’s recruited more than 300 people with severe asthma from 11 countries. Researchers found that 90% of participants who received a monthly tezepelumab injection were able to reduce or stop taking their daily steroid tablets, without any impact on their symptoms. Tezepelumab is an antibody which targets parts of the immune system, reducing lung inflammation.

Scientists are eager to find alternative treatments for managing severe asthma, as long-term daily steroid use can lead to serious health problems, including osteoporosis, diabetes, and increased vulnerability to infections.

“This is an incredibly encouraging development for the future of asthma care that could transform the lives of people with severe asthma,” said Dr Samantha Walker of the charity Asthma + Lung UK.

The study was funded by pharmaceutical companies AstraZeneca and Amgen. Further research is planned.

‘Caring businesses’ honoured at UK awards

Businesses that employ ex-offenders to work on environmental projects, train homelessness people to be baristas, and support Palestinian farmers were among the winners of this year’s UK Social Enterprise of the Year award, held on Wednesday.

The annual gong recognises the growing contribution that social enterprises make to the economy and wider society, and celebrates “Britain at its best”.

The Skill Mill was among the winners. It provides environmental jobs for young people involved in the criminal justice system. Other winners included Change Please, which helps lift people out of homelessness by training them to be baristas, and Zaytoun CIC, which supports Palestinian farmers producing food in the West Bank.

“Every year brings its challenges, but 2025 saw a difficult economic trading environment alongside a sometimes unsettling national conversation on what it means to be British which dominated the political landscape,” said Peter Holbrook, Social Enterprise UK’s chief exec. “It’s therefore truly heartening to celebrate businesses built on care and compassion that support the most vulnerable members of our communities, representing Britain at its best.”

Crop yields soar thanks to solar panels – study

Solar farms and agriculture are often billed as rivals when it comes to land use. A new study supports a growing consensus that the opposite is true.

Canadian researchers found that partial shading provided by agrivoltaic systems – solar arrays with crops growing under them – can boost food production, while improving soil health and encouraging nutrient cycling. The benefits increase when the panels are not in use, the study found, meaning decommissioned solar farms could still provide an economic boost to farmers.

Using yield modelling, the study estimated that agrivoltaic shading could boost farm income from potato production by $3.9bn (£2.95bn) in Germany alone. Other studies have reached similar conclusions.

“This agrivoltaic crop yield bump has been shown for dozens of other crops and solar panel combinations all over the world, including basil, broccoli, celery, corn, grapes, kale, lettuce, pasture grass, peppers, potatoes, tomatoes and more,” lead researcher Prof Joshua Pearce from Western University, Canada, wrote for The Conversation.

The panels, he added, help mitigate climate extremes, such as heatwaves, “delivering meaningful value for farmers”.

Learning another language ‘slows brain aging’

Being multilingual could help slow brain aging, research has found, adding to growing evidence that suggests speaking more than one language boosts cognition.

The international study of more than 86,000 people observed just a small gap between brain age and biological age in those who spoke one language. A “modest” advantage was noted for bilingual participants, with major gains seen among those speaking three or more languages.

The study did not assess level of fluency. However, the findings echo the results of similar studies, including one from 2019, which concluded that learning a second language in old age can improve cognition.

World’s most cycle-friendly cities revealed

In the race to make cities more cycle friendly, there’s a clear winner: Utrecht.

The Dutch city was this week crowned the world’s best for biking. The Danish capital, Copenhagen, and Ghent in Belgium ranked second and third respectively. It begs a question: what makes a city cycle friendly?

According to those behind the EU-funded Copenhagenize Index, it’s not just about safe and connected cycle infrastructure. Researchers also assess how equitable cycling is, and the political support behind biking.

The latest index was dominated by nations in northern Europe. The highest ranking UK city was London (33rd), while Portland, Oregon, (35th) was the best performing US city.

Utrecht’s high ranking came as little surprise to Positive News, which road tested its cycle network last year. Here’s how the Dutch city is stepping green living up a gear.

The Malaysian government must fast-track customs and import lanes for critical equipment, co-finance spare-parts pools for fabs and invest in infrastructure near semiconductor clusters such as high-quality water, power reliability and waste-treatment.

In parallel, public-private training centers should train large numbers of precision-manufacturing engineers.

Indonesia: nickel dominance, battery dream

Indonesia has leveraged its dominant nickel reserves to pull in major EV battery investments. The flagship project is the nearly $6 billion joint venture between Contemporary Amperex Technology Company (CATL) and Indonesia Battery Corporation in West Java.

A June 2025 Reuters report said the facility is scheduled to begin operations by late 2026 with an initial capacity of 6.9 GWh, with an expansion path toward 15 GWh or more. The scale demonstrates Indonesia’s ambition to anchor the region’s battery ecosystem, but it also highlights the limits of upstream advantage.

Despite controlling the raw material, Indonesia’s battery value chain is not yet integrated. The CATL–IBC project will still depend heavily on imported precursor chemicals, cathode active materials and high-precision manufacturing equipment.

The Reuters report noted that while Indonesia has rapidly expanded nickel processing, the country has not built the full suite of midstream capabilities required for stable cell production. Critical reagents and machinery remain tied to suppliers in China, South Korea and Japan.

This dependency introduces substantial strategic risk. A February 2025 C4ADS report found that Chinese companies control roughly 75% of Indonesia’s nickel-refining capacity.

That concentration means that although production occurs on Indonesian soil, operational control, technology flows and strategic decisions often originate in external corporate or policy environments. Any shift in Chinese domestic policy, export priorities or commercial strategy could ripple through Indonesia’s downstream battery plans and disrupt cell production timelines.

Given these vulnerabilities, Indonesia must accelerate development of domestic precursor and cathode-material facilities to reduce exposure to foreign suppliers. Battery-plant construction should also be sequenced with upgrades to grid capacity, wastewater management and environmental controls, since these engineering systems remain bottlenecks in several industrial zones.

Manufacturers should also design production lines with modularity so they can switch battery chemistries if global markets or reagent availability change.

Thailand: EV hub conversion

Thailand is moving quickly to convert its dominant automotive industry into an electric-vehicle hub. The Board of Investment’s EV 3.5 package, announced in 2025, offers tax incentives, consumer subsidies and import-duty relief through 2027 for manufacturers that commit to local production.

This policy has already shifted investment patterns. BYD opened a $490 million plant in Rayong in mid-2025 with capacity for 150,000 EVs annually, marking one of the largest EV manufacturing commitments in Southeast Asia. Domestic EV registrations also surged to roughly 70,000 units in 2024, up from fewer than 10,000 in 2021.

Despite these gains, Thailand’s EV ecosystem remains dependent on imported battery cells, semiconductor components and rare-earth magnets. ASEAN Briefing’s September 2025 assessment found that Thailand still lacks mid-stream capabilities such as cathode production, electrolyte processing and advanced battery-testing facilities. This dependence exposes the sector to the same vulnerabilities faced by regional semiconductor clusters.

These components also move through logistics systems designed for traditional automotive supply chains. Laem Chabang Port remains optimized for bulk auto parts rather than high-value lithium-ion cells.

EV assemblers reported delays in 2025 due to congestion and manual customs checks on sensitive components during peak export periods. Even minor slowdowns disrupt just-in-time assembly and raise operational costs.

To protect its emerging EV advantage, Thailand must expand bonded logistics zones for battery components, accelerate port digitization and cooperate with ASEAN partners to harmonize battery standards. Without these measures, Thailand’s EV ambitions will remain vulnerable to supply-chain friction and regulatory fragmentation.

Regional Risk Map

Material concentration risk. China’s export controls on rare earths and magnets create leverage points. ASEAN must map critical-element dependencies and invest in regional recycling and stockpiles.

Equipment and technology risk. Restrictive export regimes on chip-making tools raise project execution risk. ASEAN governments should establish pooled spare-parts procurement, trusted procurement corridors and diplomatic waiver channels.

Infrastructure and skills risk. All three countries face co-investment needs in power, water, waste and vocational training aligned with advanced manufacturing. ASEAN-level funding mechanisms and mutual recognition of professional certifications would reduce friction.

ASEAN stands at a pivotal moment. Opportunities to capture semiconductor back-end work, EV battery manufacturing and higher-value electronics are real. Malaysia’s move into advanced packaging, Indonesia’s downstream battery strategy and Thailand’s EV pivot are promising.

They are also fragile. Each depends on imported tools, materials and specialized skills that can be disrupted by geopolitical shifts.

The region’s success will depend on how quickly leaders can reduce those vulnerabilities through strategic infrastructure investment, targeted industrial policy, regional standardization and coordinated risk management.

Without these measures, factories across ASEAN will remain profitable in calm markets but exposed during periods of geopolitical tumult.

Chevy Holiday Magic

Starting Monday, December 1st, 2025, Chevrolet is hitting the road with an event called Chevy Holiday Magic. The show is described as a holiday spectacular that will be powered by a caravan of Chevy Silverado EVs. The traveling show will stop in five different cities. While the display is designed to bring Chevy holiday cheer to different parts of the country, it will also be a chance for Chevrolet to demonstrate how EVs can travel long distances, be effective for towing, as well as be used to provide power to displays or homes.

The Silverado EVs will help light up events at each stop along the way. The displays will include illuminating a holiday tree and a light show. The events will be held in conjunction with local Chevrolet dealers and highlight local choirs singing holiday carols. The festivities will include hot cocoa and smores. The displays will show a number of other Chevrolet vehicles as well as the incredible 1987 Suburban that stars in Chevrolet’s holiday ad this year. Chevrolet will also be working with the Toys for Tots chapter in each city to help spread holiday cheer to families in need.

From San Diego to Detroit, the caravan will travel 2,987 miles, with stops in Dallas, Nashville and Atlanta, to demonstrate the truck’s capability to travel long distances.

The 2026 Chevrolet Silverado

According to Chevy, the Silverado EVs get up to 494 miles of range, and the truck’s offboard power can use the truck’s battery to provide electric power to the truck's 11 outlets. That is based on the Maximum Range Silverado Work Truck.

Chevrolet hasn’t released all of the trim levels that will be available for the 2026 models, however it recently announced a new Trail Boss off-roading package for 2026 Silverado EVs. I would expect we will still see the Work Truck, the LT and the RST. The Silverado EV is also available with the Sidewinder feature that allows the truck to have four-wheel steer, or the ability to crabwalk. That perk has been popular on the HUMMER EVs and is also available on the Cadillac Escalade IQ.

Those “ingredients” are in the memorandum of understanding that Carney and Alberta Premier Danielle Smith signed in Calgary to great fanfare, including two standing ovations for the prime minister from a business crowd. Nothing is certain without a private sector investor because neither Ottawa nor Alberta say they are interested in underwriting a pipeline with tens of billions of taxpayers’ dollars.

Hodgson said the deal includes a July 1 deadline for any private sector investor pitches that must meet several requirements, including buy-in from the B.C. government and the province’s First Nations groups.

“The proponent has not come forward with a route. They have not come forward with a proposal at this point in time,” said Hodgson.

“They got some work to do,” he added, saying it is “premature” for critics to worry about a new oil pipeline to the B.C. coast.

Carney has spend months rolling back energy and environment policies championed by Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government, starting with Canada’s work on the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change.

The MOU did away with an emissions cap on oil and gas, clean energy regulations, rules that punished companies for “greenwashing” and could potential lift a ban on oil tankers off the B.C. coast — policies Guilbeault helped create.

Hodgson said critics should not be in a rush to judge Carney’s commitment to fighting climate change. “I have known him for 25 years,” said Hodgson. “When he has a vision for what needs to happen, he creates KPIs [key performance indicators] — and we better damn deliver them.”

Carney was the U.N. Special Envoy on Climate Action and Finance before entering politics this year, winning the Liberal leadership and then a federal election on the pledge that he was best suited to protect Canada’s economy against President Donald Trump’s economic attacks on Canada.

“The prime minister is at the center of some pretty complex geopolitics right now, and is maybe charging a slightly different path based on the realities we find in the world today,” Hodgson said.

“There was a path to get to net zero under the previous government. That path was running into real challenges with a number of provinces. This MOU sets out another way to do it.”

Hodgson pointed out that the MOU affirms Canada’s commitment to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The deal includes a new target to cut methane emissions, a requirement that Alberta and Ottawa reach an agreement on industrial carbon pricing by April 1 that could raise Alberta’s current carbon price from C$95 per ton to $130 per ton, and a focus on developing clean nuclear energy and sharing electricity better across the western Canadian provinces.

Hodgson was optimistic heading into a Friday meeting with British Columbia Premier David Eby, a day after the premier called the pipeline proposal an “energy vampire,” touting instead the billions of dollars worth of fully funded and shovel-ready LNG export projects in his province.

“We have a very constructive and productive relationship with the British Columbia government,” Hodgson said. “It’s not an accident that there are more projects on the major projects list in British Columbia than any other province.”

Carney’s minister said that said that when Eby called to ask for help to ease the effect of Trump’s softwood lumber tariffs on B.C. forestry workers, the government reacted.

“We got on a plane, we came out, we sat down and we talked about the challenges. We said we will come back with solutions,” Hodgson said, citing this week’s announcement by Ottawa of an aid package for steel and lumber.

“We have a very respectful and constructive conversation between our two levels of government,” Hodgson said.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Ffb%2Ffc%2F91cf687247829ad5e6b4dfb7a6f0%2Fcp175382787.JPG,N,,2025-11-28 17:59:26.667809

Not this week.

In the hours between the party-room meeting and Senate question time at 2pm that afternoon, the Greens’ environment spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, was not fronting the cameras but instead holed-up in the office of her Labor counterpart, Murray Watt, thrashing out a deal to finally re-write the nation’s dated and broken environment protection laws.

Around the same time, the opposition leader, Sussan Ley, was raging on Sky News about the “totally insufficient” offer that Watt had made to secure the Coalition’s support.

The government says it was genuinely prepared to deal with either party as late as Wednesday night, adamant its overhaul of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act would pass the Senate before parliament finished for the year on Thursday.

But the striking contrast between the two in that brief period on Tuesday – the Greens, conspicuous in their silence, and the Coalition, seemingly resolute in their resistance – suggested one side was always more likely.

Whereas the Greens were consistent with their demands throughout negotiations, the opposition continually shifted the goalposts – lobbing new requests at the government as late as 9.30pm on Wednesday, according to government and Coalition sources.

After 72 hours of high-stakes negotiations and tense internal deliberations, in particular among Hanson-Young’s colleagues, Anthony Albanese announced the deal at 8am on Thursday to pass the laws with the Greens.

The agreement included concessions to the Greens to prevent the fast-tracking of coal and gas, removing the exemption for native forest logging within 18 months and tightening a loophole for agricultural land-clearing.

The bill was rushed through the Senate on Thursday night, an abrupt ending to the five-year struggle to act on Graeme Samuel’s blueprint to fix the nature laws.

“The bills were rammed through with almost no time for scrutiny,” the independent senator David Pocock said, decrying the package as only a “partial” win for nature.

The timing could not have been more apt.

Almost exactly 12 months ago, Albanese intervened to scuttle a deal that Watt’s predecessor, Tanya Plibersek, had reached with the Greens and Pocock to create a federal environment protection agency in a frantic conclusion to the 2024 parliamentary year.

This time, Albanese was not only prepared to negotiate with the Greens but offer far more concessions, albeit on a bill that included much more than a federal EPA.

What changed? The political climate for one.

After winning the May federal election and no longer anxious to avoid a campaign backlash in the mining state of Western Australia, Albanese appointed Watt – his “Mr Fix it” – with the imprimatur to negotiate whatever deal was required to pass the laws.

A ‘one-time’ offer to fix nature

Senior Labor sources familiar with negotiations say the Greens under their new leader, Larissa Waters, were “very good to deal with”, contrasting it with obstinance they believe characterised the minor party’s approach under Adam Bandt.

Albanese said as much on Thursday morning, praising the “maturity” of the party he has spent much of his political career fighting.

The prime minister injected himself into the negotiations on Wednesday morning, meeting with Waters, Hanson-Young and Watt in his office to iron-out the remaining sticking points.

Albanese was clear the “one-time” offer would be pulled if the Greens did not grab it this week.

The ultimatum put the Greens in a bind. While reluctant to accept a deal that did not directly combat the climate crisis, party veterans were conscious that any delays would give industry – particularly cashed-up miners – time to water-down or kill the reforms.

But the Greens also had leverage. Labor’s self-imposed deadline to pass the laws this week meant both it and the Coalition knew they could extract more than they otherwise could.

The Greens convened another party-room around midday on Wednesday to debate their final position.

With the government ruling out a so-called “climate trigger”, securing protection for forests, and quickly, became the Greens’ main priority.

The government initial offer of a three-year timeframe to end the exemption was resisted because, in Hanson-Young’s words, “three years to let the loggers get in there and trash our native forest is three years too long”.

Labor eventually agreed to halve that timeframe to 18 months as well as crack down on land-clearing, significantly bridging the divide between the two parties.

Before the final deliberations, the Greens sounded out influential figures in the environment movement to seek assurances they would publicly support them if they agreed a deal.

It was time to make a decision.

‘Know when to hold them, when to fold them’

Even as expectations of a Greens deal grew throughout Wednesday, including among industry lobbyists who wanted an agreement between the major parties, Labor continued to pursue the other option.

At 11am on Wednesday, Watt met with his Liberal counterpart, Angie Bell, the shadow resources minister, Susan McDonald, and Tasmania senator Jonno Duniam – the former shadow environment spokesperson who was pushing hard for a deal.

Watt was prepared to accept some of the opposition’s requests, including constraining the powers of the federal EPA, but wouldn’t cede on others, such a requirement for proponents of heavy polluting projects to disclose greenhouse gas emissions as part of their application.

Multiple sources confirmed Bell raised new demands, complicating the chances of a deal between the major parties and frustrating her own colleagues.

About 4pm and after their party-room meeting, Waters and Hanson-Young made the short walk to the prime minister’s office to finalise the negotiations before Albanese was due at The Lodge for Christmas drinks with press gallery journalists.

As late as Wednesday, the Greens were prepared to oppose the laws if they couldn’t secure a satisfactory deal.

Waters and Hanson-Young left that meeting confident they had.

“[In negotiations] you do have to know when to hold them, when to fold them, and when to play the cards you’ve got to get an outcome,” Hanson-Young said.

As festivities at The Lodge started around 5pm, the official word from the government was that a deal – with either side – was yet to be reached.

That was technically true. Amendments were still being negotiated through the night.

Albanese would need to inform stakeholders, including the Tasmanian premier, Jeremy Rockliff, whose state’s logging industry faces an uncertain future after the deal.

The prime minister had already discussed the prospects of a Greens deal with the Western Australian premier, Roger Cook, who had joined forces with the state’s powerful mining to successfully lobby Albanese to shelve Plibersek’s proposal.

Cook did make another 11th-hour intervention, posting a short video to Instagram appealing to the Coalition to broker a pro-business package with Labor.

The opposition continued negotiations late into Wednesday night, submitting revised demands at 9.30pm.

Senior Coalition figures still believed a deal could be reached as late as Thursday morning.

They were right – it just wasn’t with them.

The fight for climate goes on

“Today, I can announce our government’s landmark environmental law reform will pass the parliament today, heralding a new era for the environment and productivity in Australia,” Albanese said at the Thursday morning press conference alongside Watt and the finance minister, Katy Gallagher.

Waters, Hanson-Young and McKim stood up soon after, heralding the progress for environmental protection while warning the fight to consider climate effects in federal nature laws was far from over.

“This has been a tough negotiation but we’ve managed to deliver some tough blows,” Hanson-Young said.

At her own press conference, Ley decried the “dirty deal” between Labor and the Greens and insisted the Coalition had acted in “good faith” to broker an agreement.

Samuel – who Ley, as Scott Morrison’s environment minister, commissioned for the review that inspired the reforms – had a different view.

“They have manoeuvred themselves into irrelevance on this matter,” the former consumer watchdog said of the Coalition.

“Absolute irrelevance.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56d02fabab278645644cc7cc9676a64c967134eb/0_0_2500_2000/master/2500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6b882d117a2b82c70ac51ae33d7baefd",N,,2025-11-28 16:59:36.191410

Gretchen Whitmer sat down for an unusually transparent financial review on YouTuber Caleb Hammer's ""Financial Audit"" show on Nov. 3.

The headline number that should worry taxpayers: Michigan carries an unfunded pension liability of approximately $27 billion, which is scheduled to be amortized and fully addressed within a 15-year period ending around 2038, roughly five times the state’s annual K-12 school aid fund contribution.

While the pension system improved its funding ratio to 74.83% from 66.3% the previous year, Whitmer said, that gain came primarily from market recovery rather than structural reform.

“Pensions are being phased out as a policy,” Whitmer said on the show, noting that future generations of state employees won’t receive them—a move designed to shrink the liability over time.

The Real Threat: Tariff Chaos and CEO Pessimism

Perhaps more concerning than legacy pension obligations is the current business climate. A staggering 87% of CEOs in Michigan expect a weaker overall state economy over the next decade, Whitmer said during her appearance.

The culprit? Trade policy uncertainty that’s hitting Michigan’s manufacturing and agricultural sectors particularly hard.

“The tariff chaos and unpredictability of trade policies coming out of Washington, D.C.” is creating stress and uncertainty throughout the state economy, Whitmer said. Michigan’s heavy reliance on advanced manufacturing—especially automotive—makes it uniquely vulnerable to tariff fluctuations.

Whitmer advocated for using tariffs “like a scalpel, not a sledgehammer,” suggesting a more targeted approach to trade policy.

The EV Transition Gamble

Michigan is betting big on electric vehicles and battery manufacturing to maintain its automotive dominance. The state pledged $1 billion through its “Make It in Michigan” program for five EV battery-related projects.

“Batteries are the heaviest component, where they are built will become the center of gravity for the long-term dominance in mobility,” Whitmer said, positioning Michigan to be the place where batteries are manufactured.

But this strategy carries risk. The University of Michigan's Michigan Economic Outlook for 2025–2027 projects a 3.9% increase in per-capita income this year, but warns that overall growth will slow. Meanwhile, Michigan ranks 49th nationally in population growth—a major long-term economic headwind, according to the Michigan State Revenue and Economic Outlook published by the House Fiscal Agency.

Controversial Revenue Sources

Michigan’s school aid fund relies on sales tax but also draws from marijuana taxes generating $270 million and gaming taxes. These revenue sources—often called “sin taxes”—are described as the “easiest taxes for legislators to take votes on,” though critics argue they disproportionately affect lower-income individuals, according to Whitmer.

The state also increased its Working Families Tax Credit from 6% to 30%, a form of redistribution that Whitmer said incentivizes full-time work and disproportionately supports families raising children.

For investors watching Michigan’s municipal bonds or companies with significant Michigan operations, the combination of CEO pessimism, slow population growth, and massive unfunded pension liabilities suggests caution. The state’s EV bet may pay off long-term, but the transition period looks increasingly turbulent.

Virginia-based QTS Data Centers on Tuesday announced it will partner with the Building Trades Council of South Central Wisconsin to build a $12 billion data center campus in Dane County. The project will include a $50 million community commitment for the area and will support up to 5,000 trade jobs, officials said.

The project will span up to 1,600 acres, with the first three years focused on constructing five data center buildings across 650 acres in the town of Vienna, a QTS presentation showed. The company will also partner with Alliant Energy to develop 750 megawatts of renewable energy generation. The company said it will pay for all project energy infrastructure.

The DeForest Village Board met Nov. 18 and reviewed a presentation from QTS Data Centers. The developer plans to annex land from Vienna into the village of DeForest, and no action was planned for the meeting, according to the village agenda.

“Before any development may proceed, several public processes would need to occur within the village of DeForest as well as within some State of Wisconsin departments and regional public agencies,” village officials said. “This review and consideration of necessary approvals may occur over the course of many months or more.”

QTS officials said the multibillion-dollar investment will rely on union labor to fill thousands of construction jobs and demonstrate the company’s commitment to local investment and workforce development.

“This partnership with QTS reflects our shared commitment to ensuring that the digital infrastructure our company depends on is built by the highly skilled union workers who live in the very communities it will serve,” said Tracey Griffith, executive director of the Building Trades Council of South Central Wisconsin, in a statement. “When local union members are on the job, projects are built safely and with the exceptional skill and quality our workforce is known for. The economic benefits stay right here at home in Dane County — supporting families, strengthening neighborhoods and driving long-term growth across Wisconsin. By formalizing this partnership, we are investing directly in our workers and in the economic vitality of the communities they call home.”

The labor organization is made of 17 local unions representing more than 6,000 building trades members in Wisconsin, including the North Central States Regional Council of Carpenters, the Wisconsin Laborers’ District Council and the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 139, officials said. All the groups announced support of the project.

“The QTS data center project means nearly a decade of steady work for LIUNA members right here in Dane County,” said Kent Miller, president and business manager of the Wisconsin Laborers’ District Council, in a statement. “Our training center is in DeForest, and this project keeps our members close to home — so they can earn family-supporting wages, be home for dinner, and still make it to their kids’ ballgames.”

“Our joint effort is about more than technology, it’s about people,” said Ryan Hunter, chief operations officer at QTS Data Centers, in a statement. “It allows us to move forward with the full support of Wisconsin’s impressive skilled union workforce, building a campus that strengthens the economy, supports families and sustainably powers the digital infrastructure of the future.”

QTS will work with local officials and establish a $50 million commitment to support education, workforce development and housing initiatives across Dane County, officials said. The company will also partner with Madison College and the University of Wisconsin for workforce and research programs respectively.

Vantage Data Centers, Oracle and OpenAI and Microsoft are working on separate, multi-billion-dollar data centers in different parts of the state. In October, Vantage Data Centers announced it partnered with the Wisconsin Building Trades Council to build the $15 billion Lighthouse data center in Port Washington. That project is expected to see a peak workforce of more than 4,000 skilled construction workers over three years.

The construction team in the Port Washington project includes Maryland-based Whiting-Turner, New York-based Turner Construction, Missouri-based McCarthy and Iowa-based Weitz.

In Mount Pleasant, Microsoft announced it would engage local labor unions on its data center project. The company recently shared plans for a $4 billion expansion, which will be added to its initial $3.3 billion commitment.",https://finance-commerce.com/files/2025/11/Wis.-Data-Center.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 16:59:17.861526

Upper House candidate Deepa Mathew said news buried in the business section of The Australian newspaper revealed that expensive and unreliable energy was making South Australia an unattractive place to invest.

BHP Billiton was fast-tracking big copper mining investments in South America but slow-walking South Australia because of the government's decarbonisation priority and too much red tape.

The Australian reported that BHP was ""cautiously advancing its $20bn-plus investment to dramatically expand copper production in South Australia – a megaproject which could deliver another nation-defining resource play to rival the Pilbara"".

The mega project known as Copper SA was drifting and with BHP putting of a decision on an energy intensive smelter until 2028.

The Australian reported:

""The energy crisis is stark. ABS inflation figures this week show electricity costs in Australia have surged 22 per cent in two years, excluding rebates. Costs here are two or more times higher than in Canada and other countries where BHP operates, and 50-100 per cent higher than in the US.""

Ms Mathew said South Australia was saddled with massive government debt and needed wealth-creating projects like Copper SA so families could once again flourish economically.

""Peter Malinauskas is letting investment slip through South Australia's fingers to South America and that is putting pressure on families.

""It's time for ideology to stop driving energy policy.

""To take the pressure off families, South Australia needs abundant, cheap and reliable energy so industry can invest and create the jobs our kids need.

""Windmills farms and solar factories can't do it and there is no battery in existence that can power a city let along a copper smelter.""

Ms Mathew said Family First would always prioritise cheap and reliable energy like gas, coal and in the future uranium over expensive and ideologically driven windmills and solar factories.

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is providing an update on its reconsideration of the final risk management rule for perchloroethylene (PCE) under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). As noted in the November 28, 2025 declaration to the court, EPA expects to publish a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to amend the 2024 PCE Rule in or around summer 2026 and publish a final rule in 2027. EPA is also considering options for extending certain compliance dates established by the 2024 PCE Rule, including options involving a more expedited rulemaking process to address compliance date extensions. This reconsideration is being done in accordance with applicable law, Executive Orders, and Administration policies, including Executive Order 14219 “Ensuring Lawful Governance and Implementing the President’s ‘Department of Government Efficiency’ Deregulatory Initiative” and the EPA’s Powering the Great American Comeback Initiative Pillar I: Clean Air, Land, and Water for Every American.

After the 2024 PCE Rule was published, several legal challenges were filed. These petitions for review were consolidated in the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The Court previously granted a temporary abeyance while EPA conducts a rulemaking to reassess the challenged rule and ordered EPA to update the Court with its plans for issuing a new rule.

“The more people that experience an EV, it’s like a one-way door,” Scaringe said.

It’s a company designed to build many times more, the CEO of the upstart EV maker told the editorial board of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution last week. To get there, Rivian is banking on its newest vehicle, the R2, a two-row crossover, to be a big hit.

Initial manufacturing of the R2 will start in Illinois, but Scaringe said production will expand to its future factory an hour east of Atlanta when it opens, albeit years later than initially expected, in 2028. Future models, including the smaller R3 and R3X, are expected to follow.

“The more people that experience an EV, it’s like a one-way door,” Scaringe said. “It’s hard to go into an EV and then back to a (gas-powered) vehicle.”

He said Rivian will start customer deliveries of R2 early next year, and soon start vertical construction of the Georgia plant after a ceremonial groundbreaking in September. In a wide-ranging interview with the AJC, Scaringe went into detail about the company’s future, why Georgia is crucial to that success and the future of the auto industry.

Scaringe likes to say that software is as important to modern cars as the nuts and bolts of assembly.

Rivian is designed to do both. That strategy entranced investors while creating its own challenges and setbacks when the pandemic struck, but Scaringe argues it’s a framework made to support more than just a niche automaker.

The need to ramp up production is why Georgia is such a critical cog in Rivian’s machine aimed at rivaling Tesla as a leader of America’s new school of automaking.

“This is an investment you don’t make for one product cycle,” Scaringe said of his company’s planned $5 billion factory an hour east of Atlanta. “You make the investment for many product cycles. It’s a multidecade, multi-billion dollar investment.”

Next year is a vital one for California-based Rivian, which plans to launch R2 at a starting price of $45,000 to target a mass market. The forthcoming Georgia plant is poised to multiply the number of R2s rolling off assembly lines.

Confident it will succeed, Scaringe said the R2 and its iterations will provide the same boost to Rivian that Tesla found with its mid-priced Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover.

Those two Tesla models make up more than 40% of all EV sales this year through September, according to Cox Automotive data. Cox Enterprises, the owner of the AJC, also owns Cox Automotive and a 3% stake in Rivian.

“In something like clothing or cars or goods that reflect your own personality, you tend to see many winners,” Scaringe said. “So having a single player with nearly 50% market share is not a reflection of a healthy market — it’s a reflection of a highly underserved market.”

September was a new high-water mark for EV sales, but it’s expected to be a temporary peak. Federal tax credits worth up to $7,500 for qualifying new EV purchases were revoked at the end of that month, creating a fleeting window of opportunity for the EV curious.

“The training wheels are coming off,” said Stephanie Valdez-Streaty, director of operations management at Cox Automotive. “This shift will test whether the electric vehicle market is mature enough to thrive on its own fundamentals or still needs support to expand further.”

For Rivian, Scaringe said the startup’s history until now has been about learning and growing. He said Rivian’s Georgia investments will show the company is ready for the expanded spotlight.

“We’re a much, much more mature business,” he said. “And we’ve built processes to handle some of these unexpected externalities.”

Learning curve

The path for Rivian hasn’t been smooth.

The company’s 2021 initial public offering was among the largest in U.S. history. The company’s valuation peaked at more than $100 billion, briefly surpassing juggernauts like Ford, an early Rivian investor, and General Motors.

Rivian also courted other deep-pocked investors including Amazon, inking a $1 billion deal to supply the e-commerce giant with 100,000 EV vans.

But Wall Street’s stratospheric expectations soon came back to Earth amid the COVID-19 pandemic, a supply chain that buckled under the pressure and Rivian’s struggles to meet production demands. Scaringe said it was a tough time for his company, which has yet to turn a profit.

Among the challenges Rivian faced were getting components because it didn’t have the deep manufacturing history of traditional automakers.

“It was a combination of learning for the first time, launching multiple products, dealing with a global pandemic and then being last in line to get parts from suppliers,” he said.

Those scars have informed Rivian’s R2 strategy, reframing Georgia’s role in the company’s long-term plans.

When unveiling the prototype R2 in March 2024, Scaringe sent shock waves through the Peach State by pausing the Georgia plant’s development. The decision was cited as a temporary cost-cutting measure and an effort to focus on launching R2 more quickly from the company’s existing Illinois factory.

Within 24 hours of the R2 reveal, Rivian announced it had nearly 70,000 preorders. Scaringe declined to provide any updates to that figure but said “the excitement hasn’t waned.”

Rivian later announced it would resume construction of the Georgia factory in 2026, and will create 7,000 promised jobs.

State and local leaders also provided an estimated $1.5 billion incentive package to recruit Rivian to Georgia. Most of those benefits materialize only if the company meets its job and investment figures by 2030. Rivian will also receive support from a $6.6 billion federal loan.

In recent days, Rivian opened its East Coast headquarters along the Atlanta Beltline, which the company said will employ 500 workers by the end of next year. The back-end research and development work, Scaringe said, is just as vital to Rivian’s success as its mechanical chops.

“We didn’t design the business to be selling 50,000 cars a year,” he said, citing the company’s current production output. “We have a cost structure, particularly on the R & D side, that was set up to be a much, much bigger business.”

Creating leverage

Unlike traditional automakers, Rivian and electrified peers like Tesla have developed a new technology backbone for their vehicles.

Most conventional cars have more than 100 small computers called electronic control units to handle small tasks.

One ECU handles seat adjustments. Another is in charge of side mirror controls. Yet another is tasked with injecting fuel into the engine. Those ECUs are developed by separate part suppliers and often include a mishmash of operating systems.

“It’s a very, very messy architecture,” Scaringe said. “It’s precisely the opposite of what you’d want to have.”

Rivian, along with Tesla, have a handful of more powerful computers called domain control units that handle several tasks. Scaringe said that decision reduces assembly complexity, saves thousands of dollars on computer chips and will pay off once the company reaches a certain scale.

“We have more computer engineers and software engineers at Rivian than we have mechanical engineers by a pretty significant degree,” he said.

For automakers to succeed in the future, Scaringe said, they will have to have a software backbone like Rivian and Tesla. They’ll get there one of two ways — developing it themselves or finding a technology partner.

The company’s technology platform caught the attention of the world’s second-largest automaker, Volkswagen Group.

In June 2024, Rivian and VW announced a joint software partnership worth an estimated $5.8 billion. Rivian agreed to contribute technology to the German auto giant’s fleet of new EVs, while VW’s financial contributions would support Rivian as it ramped up production.

Scaringe said that partnership also gives Rivian newfound leverage when negotiating with suppliers and preparing to launch R2 — both in Illinois and in Georgia.

“(Suppliers) are super excited to work with us because the choice we make in Rivian vehicles is also the choice that goes into Volkswagen vehicles, which is Porsche, Audi, VW, Bentley and a whole host of brands,” Scaringe said. “It’s a complete flip of the nature of that relationship.”

With the groundwork laid — and ground literally about to break east of Atlanta — Scaringe said Rivian’s next chapter is filled with potential.

“Now it’s about execution,” Scaringe said.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/gmtoday.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/dc/5dc406a4-6abc-4307-9659-f46a64b94a0f/6929f81557081.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-11-28 15:59:43.640482

He then launched a Major Projects Office to fast-track initiatives he said would strengthen Canada's economic sovereignty, creating a bulwark against the impacts of Trump's tariffs.
""Canada and Alberta are striking a new partnership to build a stronger, more sustainable, and more independent Albertan and Canadian economy,"" Carney said.
- Carney, a former central banker, worked on climate issues before joining politics in January, but has emphasized market-driven solutions to environmental challenges.
Increased oil exports to Asia would reduce Canada's economic dependence on an unreliable United States, he said.","Critics accuse Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney of betraying the fight against climate change.

Others say he is facing reality and has no choice but boost polluting sectors that are vital to an economy being punished by US President Donald Trump's trade war.

But there is no dispute that since replacing former prime minister Justin Trudeau in March Carney has repositioned his Liberal Party on the environment.

Immediately after taking office, Carney scrapped Trudeau's unpopular carbon tax on individuals.

He then launched a Major Projects Office to fast-track initiatives he said would strengthen Canada's economic sovereignty, creating a bulwark against the impacts of Trump's tariffs.

Mining and natural gas projects -- criticized by some environmental advocates -- were among the early picks.

But the most dramatic development came on Thursday, when Carney struck a deal with the conservative-led energy-producing Alberta province to advance a new oil pipeline, while increasing overall oil and gas production.

""Canada and Alberta are striking a new partnership to build a stronger, more sustainable, and more independent Albertan and Canadian economy,"" Carney said.

""We will make Canada an energy superpower, drive down our emissions and diversify our export markets.”

The deal marked a clear pivot for Carney's Liberal Party and a departure from the policies that defined Trudeau's decade in power.

Alberta Premier Danielle Smith, who loathed Trudeau's policies, said this month that ""the tone of federal government has done a 180 in the last year.""

Steven Guilbeault, a member of Carney's cabinet, who was also Trudeau's environment minister, agreed.

He resigned Thursday, hours after the pipeline deal was signed.

Guilbeault said he entered politics ""to champion the fight against climate change,"" but that key green policies he implemented with Trudeau were being ""dismantled"" under Carney.

- Climate policy 'erosion'? -

Carney, a former central banker, worked on climate issues before joining politics in January, but has emphasized market-driven solutions to environmental challenges.

In 2019, he became a UN envoy focused on mobilizing public and private finance to help achieve the goals of the Paris Accords.

He then joined the massive Canadian multinational firm Brookfield, steering private capital to aid climate action.

The Alberta pipeline plan is in its infancy and may never move forward.

But Carney's memorandum of understanding with Alberta to advance an initiative that involves piping bitumen to Canada's northwest Pacific coast and building a massive port to accommodate oil tankers has drawn outrage.

Carney said the plan could be a win-win.

Increased oil exports to Asia would reduce Canada's economic dependence on an unreliable United States, he said.

And, he stressed, the deal requires oil companies to pay a steep industrial carbon tax, which could help fund cleaner energy sources, while the impact of rising emissions would be offset through carbon capture -- a controversial technology.

Sierra Club Canada's communications chief, Conor Curtis, told AFP there has been an ""erosion of climate policy,"" under the new Liberal government.

""A new oil pipeline is not necessary. We are in the middle of a global transition to renewable energy,"" he said in an interview before Thursday's signing.

- 'Profound disruptions' -

Tim McMillan, the former president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, said Carney had no choice but to embrace the oil sector.

""After 10 years of cancelled projects and lowering GDP per capita and standards of living in Canada, we're at a point, especially with the US tariff threats, that Canada needs to look at our strengths,"" McMillan told AFP.

""Oil and gas are at the top of that list.""

Even Guilbeault, a prominent environmental activist before entering politics, acknowledged Carney was in a tough spot, conceding that Trump had triggered ""profound disruptions"" in Canada's key economic relationship.

""Despite this difficult economic context, I remain one of those for whom environmental issues must remain front and center,"" he said.",https://www.rtl.lu/sassets/rtl2008.lu/nt/p/2025/11/29/01/8373dd5278c83919d39c20da5ac6c35b.jpeg,N,,2025-11-28 19:58:30.910684

According to the report, “Power Hungry: Why Gas and Coal Alone Won’t Keep Up with US Power Demand Growth” from Wood Mackenzie, meeting this demand growth through 2030 is the largest challenge faced by the US power sector.

“If more plant retirements are delayed, the value could rise to 67 GW, but significant uncertainty surrounds how many more retirements will be deferred,” Patrick Huang, senior research analyst at Wood Mackenzie. “90 GW of demand growth is well below the 160 GW of US utilities’ large load commitments tracked by Wood Mackenzie, as supply dictates how much demand growth can materialize.”

Huang added that if coal and gas plants ramp up utilization, the existing thermal fleet could meet up to 47 GW of peak demand growth.

This is less than 30% of the large load commitments made by U.S. utilities and will be offset by 98 GW of planned coal and gas retirements (59 GW of peak load contribution lost) through 2030.

Further retirement deferrals could keep 50 GW (30 GW of peak load contribution) online past 2030, but even in this scenario coal and gas generation falls short of meeting total demand growth.

Since keeping old coal and gas units online for longer is expensive and can run against state priorities, delaying retirements for a large portion of the existing fleet will be challenging.

The report notes that manufacturing bottlenecks are a key constraint on new thermal capacity. Gas turbine orders currently face extended lead times, with new gas plant additions limited to 58 GW (49 GW of peak load contribution) between 2025 and the end of 2030. Furthermore, the rising cost of gas turbines will make these additions very expensive in comparison to current wholesale electricity prices.

Remote, northern, and Arctic communities are on the front lines of climate change. For generations, Inuit have led the way in adapting to extreme weather and rapidly shifting conditions – bringing deep knowledge of the land and sea, and a tradition of innovation that strengthens communities across Nunatsiavut. The Government of Canada is committed to supporting that leadership with generational investments in clean, reliable energy that reflect local priorities.

While in Goose Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador, the Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations, the Honourable Rebecca Alty — on behalf of the Minister of Northern and Arctic Affairs and the Minister of Energy and Natural Resources — announced nearly $22 million in federal investments to advance three Inuit-led clean energy initiatives that will harness solar, wind, and tidal power while creating jobs across the region.

Funding for the Nain Wind Energy Project will support the installation of two wind turbines and battery storage to help reduce Nain’s reliance on costly, polluting diesel fuel for electricity. Once operational, the project is expected to displace more than one million litres of diesel every year – cutting emissions, improving air quality, and delivering more reliable and affordable power for the community.

At the same time, a second project led by the Nunatsiavut Government near Rigolet is receiving funding to continue collecting data to identify locations for a potential tidal energy facility.

Residents divided: opportunity for some, unfinished project for others

The decision came on November 25 after hearing from residents and supporters urging the council to adopt the agreement tied to the AlumniFi Field project. Seven council members voted in favour; council president and mayor-elect Mary Sheffield, along with council member Mary Waters, were absent.

Many locals and DCFC supporters highlighted the potential impact on young people. Youth coach Duane Daniels argued that the stadium could become a place offering purpose and an alternative to violence-stricken environments. Drawing from his own background in tough neighbourhoods, he said he tries to show young people that even dreams of professional football can be within reach.

But not all Corktown residents were convinced. Bill Cheek said the project lacked key details on traffic flow, parking plans and noise management. In his view, the city should have demanded stronger guarantees. Meanwhile, Khari Turner — whose son plays in the club’s academy — stressed that DCFC has built an environment where kids from different neighbourhoods and backgrounds grow together. He added that the new stadium would be more than a sports venue: it would serve as a community anchor and a source of shared identity.

Stadium to rise on former hospital site

The new stadium will be built at Michigan Avenue and 20th Street, on the long-abandoned Southwest Detroit Hospital grounds. The complex had deteriorated badly — nearly two million gallons of water had accumulated in its basement and were pumped out this past summer. AlumniFi Field will hold 15,000 spectators, more than twice the capacity of DCFC’s current home, Keyworth Stadium in Hamtramck.

The full project is priced at $198 million, with $153 million allocated to the stadium itself. A four-storey mixed-use building will go up alongside it, featuring 76 residential units of varying sizes, 8,500 square feet of commercial space and a 421-spot parking garage. Another 680 parking spaces are planned at ground level within the complex.

The housing mix includes at least eight studios, 60 one-bedroom units and eight two-bedroom units. Sixty apartments will be reserved for households earning up to 80% of the Area Median Income (AMI), which for Detroit stands at $56,560 for a one-person household. Another eight units will be reserved for residents earning up to 60% AMI.

$88 million in public incentives and brownfield capture

Although the stadium is privately financed, DCFC is seeking a package of tax breaks and incentives worth $88 million over 30 years. The largest portion comes from the brownfield capture mechanism, projected at around $74 million from future taxes generated by the site. The project is also set to benefit from two commercial incentives worth just under $14 million combined.

According to the current schedule, construction on the stadium will begin in March. Co-owner Sean Mann says the timeline is tight but still achievable, with an eye on opening for the 2027 USL Championship season. Demolition at the former hospital site has already begun, and, as Mann put it, the real wrecking balls are expected in the coming weeks. Construction of the residential building is slated for November 2026 and will take two years. The overall project is expected to create 142 full-time jobs and more than a thousand construction positions during the build phase.

What the CBA includes: 46 commitments over 12 years

Negotiated throughout the fall by a nine-member resident committee and club representatives, the CBA outlines 46 commitments valid for 12 years. They include a one-time $200,000 payment to a low-interest loan fund for local small businesses and $1.2 million in community grants — $100,000 delivered annually to organisations in housing, culture and education.

It also guarantees the distribution of 3,000 free tickets annually to residents of nearby neighbourhoods, hiring preference first for ZIP codes 48216, 48208, 48210 and 48209, and then for all Detroit residents. DCFC will work with Detroit At Work to fill stadium jobs. For the first five years of stadium operations, the club commits to a $17 minimum hourly wage for all stadium employees.

The CBA also includes cultural and symbolic elements: at least $50,000 for art installations and murals referencing the history of Southwest Detroit and the former hospital; limited use of facial-recognition technology; a mentorship program for youth interested in sports-related careers; and a $100,000 investment in a new mini-pitch to be completed by the end of 2028. It also requires that at least 51% of construction workers be Detroit residents and that half of stadium vendors come from the city. Construction work will be restricted to 7 a.m.–6 p.m. from Monday to Friday.

Parking has long been a concern for Corktown residents. The agreement ensures a total of 2,500 parking spaces in the stadium area to reduce the impact of matchdays on surrounding streets.",https://stadiumdb.com/img/news/2025/11/26342-thumbnail.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 13:59:38.520950

Global EV Adoption: Only Modest Pace in 2025

The electrification of the global automotive fleet continues to progress slowly this year. Data show sales of 14.5 million EVs in the first nine months, with October figures expected to match September levels.

The numbers thus point toward full-year 2025 sales of approximately 21 million EVs. This would represent a 24% market share and a 20% year-on-year growth in unit volumes in our forecast (see chart)

BNEF analysts project slightly higher figures, forecasting 21.9 million EVs and a 25% global market share. Rho Motion, meanwhile, estimates the EV market share at 23% for the January-October 2025 period.

Last year’s market share stood at 22%. An advance from 22% to 23-25% in 2025 would therefore prove disappointing.

Headwinds come from two markets: the United States and China.

United States

Weakness in US sales has been anticipated since President Trump’s inauguration in January. Federal incentives that supported the market for 15 years—including tax credits and leasing credits—expired at the end of September.

This triggered a September spike followed by an October collapse. November and December figures are likewise expected to disappoint. S&P Global projects market share falling to just 7%. Only state-level support in California, the nation’s largest automotive market, along with manufacturer discounting, prevents an even steeper decline.

The US transportation transition has effectively stalled, as the internal combustion engine fleet expands by a net 4 million vehicles annually, substantially outpacing the 1.5 million new EV registrations.

Our forecast indicates a 3% decline in new EV registrations this year (see chart).

China

China is also experiencing the expiration of several EV incentives, including purchase tax breaks and trade-in payments. October figures already showed a modest decline compared to September.

On a positive note, the market is shifting toward higher penetration of pure battery electric vehicles (BEV), while plug-in hybrid registrations (PHEV) contract. Overall EV share of new vehicle sales has already exceeded 50% for several months. BEVs alone command approximately a market share of one third this year.

Saturation levels have been reached in several metropolitan areas. Nevertheless, continued market growth appears assured. Our forecast calls for 15% growth in new registrations for 2025.

EU and Germany

The European Union is recovering from last year’s setback. October figures already surpassed full-year 2024 totals. Our projection indicates a 25% growth in EV registrations for 2025.

Germany shows particularly robust momentum. We anticipate a growth rate of 45% this year. Even so, EV volumes will remain below the 2022 peak.

Rest of World

RoW, i.e. markets outside China, the EU, and US demonstrate highly positive trajectories. Wherever Chinese export initiatives face no import barriers, adoption rates surge dramatically.

This applies particularly to the UK which reached a 38% EV market share in October, along with numerous Latin American, South and Southeast Asian nations.

By September, the RoW volumes had already matched full-year 2024 totals. Forecasts therefore call for a substantial 40% growth in EV registrations.",https://www.energycomment.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/cropped-favicon-23jun-32x32.png,N,,2025-11-28 13:59:22.805129

In this Budget, the Chancellor made the decision to remove this levy off bills and into general taxation.
Budget 2025: Greenpeace’s verdict This Budget offered flickers of progress – but no real plan for the fairer, cleaner future the UK urgently needs.","This was a budget without a vision. Instead of taking the big steps that the country is crying out for, the Chancellor presented a Budget which reads more like she was playing energy policy whack-a-mole – reacting to problems as they popped up without following a coherent strategy. Some hits landed well, others missed entirely, but what’s missing is a vision for permanently lowering bills and accelerating the clean energy transition.

Let’s take a look at a few key areas.

Energy bills

Households across the UK are still struggling with the ongoing cost of living crisis. In this context, any reduction in household energy bills is welcome, and credit where it’s due – the Chancellor has managed to remove £150 a year from bills.

Energy Company Obligation

The Energy Company Obligation (ECO), funds home insulation and energy efficiency programmes. These funds are vital for people in fuel poverty that the programme was targeted towards because, done well, they are the best way of reducing energy bills. But the Chancellor made the decision to scrap the scheme.

This decision will result in 10,000 jobs lost almost overnight, and cause 1 million families to lose the opportunity of insulating their homes in the next four years – which would keep their bills permanently low.

ECO had some problems in delivery, including a very poor record on solid wall insulation, but it needed reforming not scrapping, by beefing up certification to kick out the cowboy builders and getting proper inspection and redress in place. The government will need these systems for ALL its energy efficiency work, so the funding could have gone into those programmes.

Although the end of ECO loses over £3bn for home upgrades this Parliament, the government has boosted other efficiency programmes, namely the Warm Homes Plan, by £1.5bn. We need to see that rolled out quickly for the benefit of both the fuel poor and those who work in the industry.

Renewables Obligation

The Renewables Obligation is a charge that was designed to ensure energy suppliers developed more new renewable energy to supply customers with. Energy suppliers levied that charge on customer electricity bills. In this Budget, the Chancellor made the decision to remove this levy off bills and into general taxation.

This decision means that households with electric heating – who are twice as likely to be fuel poor – will save the most. It will also make it cheaper for people to make the switch to electric vehicles and heat pumps, so this is a good move by the Chancellor, and one we were campaigning for, that will help lower bills and support people to make greener choices.

Paying for nuclear energy

The changes for bills don’t end there, in less optimistic news, the Chancellor has decided to add £28 on to household bills per year by 2030 to pay for nuclear energy. When we can create clean, green energy from renewables, there’s no need to fund astronomically expensive nuclear power and the waste it produces, which still, no one can find a safe way to deal with.

This Budget has endorsed a flawed review that lays the blame for nuclear power delays and cost overruns at the door of planning rules and safety standards. Yet nuclear power is delayed and over-budget in France, Finland, China, USA, and other places that obviously do not have the same regulatory standards as the UK.

In a world of limited money for climate action, nuclear becomes an obstacle to emissions cuts as money that is spent on nuclear power could be better spent on genuinely clean energy, efficiency and storage

Missed opportunity: a strategic reserve for gas power plants

However, the biggest driver of rising energy prices since 2022 has been the international gas price crisis caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. So the Government has missed an opportunity to reduce energy bills by taking gas plants out of the wholesale market and putting them into a strategic reserve.

Gas plants set electricity prices 85% of the time despite providing only 30% of generation over the last year. A strategic reserve with regulated returns would stop them extracting excessive profits during peak demand and prevent gas from dictating prices for all consumers.

They could have also taken this chance to lower leasing costs for offshore wind, helping to bring more affordable clean energy onto the grid and push down bills.

Polluter pays measures

Given the urgency of the crisis, the lack of a single mention of the climate in the chancellor’s speech was striking. The climate and cost of living crises are here on our doorstep and ordinary families are the ones paying the cost.

This budget was a missed opportunity to transfer those costs to the polluters through new taxes and fines on a fossil fuel industry that has consistently been rewarded for trashing the planet and fuelling destructive extreme weather. Nor did the chancellor take the opportunity to fix the gaping hole in the UK’s international climate finance contributions.

Windfall tax

Crucially however, the chancellor resisted a storm of oil and gas industry lobbying, and chose not to ditch or reduce the windfall tax, or Energy Profits Levy (EPL), earlier than the 2030 date forecast. She should be commended for that.

46,000 of you asked the chancellor to keep the levy and we wrote to the chancellor alongside 16 other organisations including fuel poverty groups, tax justice groups and the Fire Brigades Union. Ultimately, our voices overpowered those of the oil and gas industry.

New tax regime

In a separate document also published on budget day, the government introduced a new permanent tax regime for fossil fuel companies operating in the North Sea which will apply to revenues, rather than just profits. This is a good move – or it would be, if the rate set by the government for when the tax starts to kick in were set at a lower rate.

The tax will apply when oil prices rise to $90 per barrel and gas prices rise to 90p per therm (compared to EPL thresholds that are $71.40 per barrel and £0.54 per therm for gas). The government had an opportunity here to introduce a more progressive polluter pays tax on the world’s most polluting industry, instead their future tax regime will only apply during instances of quite substantial price shocks.

Electric vehicles

And it’s not just bills and windfall taxes that are impacted in this budget. The government has decided to introduce a new pay-per-mile tax on electric vehicles from 2028, called the Electric Vehicle Excise Duty. We don’t oppose this tax in principle – it will be necessary once electric vehicles dominate our roads. But 2028 is too early. The transition is still building momentum, and introducing the tax too soon risks slowing the switch to electric. The government should wait until after 2030 when the market is more mature.

The Office for Budget Responsibility states that there will be 440,000 fewer electric vehicle sales between now and 2031 because of this change. This would equate to emissions from the road transport sector being about 670,000 tonnes higher. When road transportation is the sector responsible for the highest emissions in the UK, this is a big climate failure.

However, the OBR also suggested that there would be around 320,000 extra sales from the £1.3bn that the government has put aside to boost takeup, partially offsetting the impact of the pay-per-mile tax.

But we should be cautious about that estimate, because it is well known that a lot of grant money ends up only lowering the purchase cost of cars that would have been bought anyway.

Budget 2025: Greenpeace’s verdict

This Budget offered flickers of progress – but no real plan for the fairer, cleaner future the UK urgently needs. At a moment when families are grappling with high bills and communities are feeling the impacts of extreme weather, the Chancellor chose tactical tweaks over strategic leadership.

Removing regressive levies from bills and keeping the windfall tax in place are meaningful wins – especially thanks to the tens of thousands of people who spoke out. But these steps sit alongside decisions that push the UK in the wrong direction: cutting insulation programmes just when they’re needed most, ploughing money into costly nuclear power, and weakening the incentives to choose electric cars. The missed chance to take gas out of the wholesale market or introduce new polluter-pays measures shows a government still unwilling to challenge the fossil fuel industry that helped create this mess.",https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/E6YY13-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 15:59:52.972914

The companies formalised the cooperation with a memorandum of understanding (MoU) at Xing Mobility’s headquarters in Taiwan.

The partnership brings together Xing Mobility’s immersion-cooled, cell-to-pack battery architecture with Ideenion’s expertise in complete vehicle design and engineering.

The collaboration is intended to address electrification needs across several segments, including high-performance and commercial vehicles, marine applications and stationary energy storage.

Xing Mobility founder and CEO Royce YC Hong said: “We’re bringing Europe’s automakers a truly immersive, integrated battery architecture – coolant is the bloodstream; the veins become the structure. Immersion isn’t just a cooling method; it’s a philosophy of integration that makes EVs lighter, safer, and faster to industrialise.”

At the centre of the initiative is Xing Mobility’s Immersio cell-to-pack system, which does away with conventional battery modules.

According to the company, this configuration allows for higher energy density, better use of space and greater freedom in packaging than traditional battery layouts.

Xing Mobility presented the technology at IAA Mobility 2025 in the Caterham Project V, using the vehicle to illustrate how a module-less structure can contribute to more compact and manoeuvrable electric platforms.

The design employs immersion cooling, in which the coolant directly surrounds the cells and also contributes to the structural integrity of the pack.

Ideenion, which has been active in the automotive sector for more than three decades, has worked with manufacturers such as Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz.

Its portfolio covers concept creation, prototype development, testing and validation, as well as limited-series production.

The partners plan to utilise Xing Mobility’s Paradigm Factory in Taoyuan, Taiwan, which the company describes as the first mass-production site dedicated exclusively to immersion-cooled battery systems.

BAIROIL—The remote dirt road through dusty fields of sagebrush that John Cash drove along in June seemed to pass little of economic value. But his car was, in fact, rattling towards the top-producing uranium mine in Wyoming.

In 2022, the Lost Creek Mine became the first of several such sites across the West to restart operations as the U.S. scrambles to reestablish a domestic supply chain for nuclear fuel.

Cash, the CEO of UR Energy, which operates the Lost Creek Mine, believes more mines will come online in the years ahead.

“This [area] is loaded with uranium,” he said amid the vast, arid expanse of Wyoming’s Great Divide Basin. “I promise you right now, if I drilled a hole right here, we would hit uranium.”

Newly revived mines are also humming in Texas and Arizona, their owners hopeful that a boom in demand lies ahead. Ten uranium mines operate in the country today, up from three in 2021, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Agency. Company announcements and public records show dozens of others on standby for reopening or queued up for permitting in Colorado, Utah and New Mexico, with at least four currently fast-tracked for approval under recent executive orders.

“We’re right at the edge of a good little uranium mining boom,” said Travis Deti, executive director of the Wyoming Mining Association. “We’ve been off the playing field for decades on some of this stuff.”

For more than a generation, many of these sites sat dormant, stifled by a cheaper imported supply and modest demand from a stagnant nuclear power sector. However, uranium markets have recently reawakened: Spot prices doubled between 2022 and 2024, driven by global supply chain disruptions, geopolitical tension and lofty expectations for a renaissance of American atomic power.

Lately, a buzzing landscape of nuclear startups has stirred excitement with announcements of ambitious plans for advanced reactors to power artificial intelligence and other heavy industries across the country. But almost all of these companies are waiting for the U.S. to rebuild a nuclear fuel supply chain before they can even power up their prototype units.

“Expectations for uranium demand have been growing,” said William Freebairn, an associate editorial director at S&P Global Commodity Insights. “But this kind of demand is slow to show up.”

Investor appetite for uranium started to increase around 2022, he said, “as climate concerns became more prominent.” Uranium is processed and enriched into nuclear fuel that provides abundant energy without carbon emissions, although it poses other significant health and safety risks.

Presidential administrations since Barack Obama’s have pushed to increase domestic production of uranium fuel to supply the national nuclear sector, but that goal remains years away. President Donald Trump issued a flurry of executive orders this year to streamline permitting, expedite environmental reviews and impose tariffs on imports that compete with American products.

Despite the recent activity, the U.S. still has a long way to go before it could even come close to meeting its nuclear needs with uranium from domestic mines, Freebairn said.

Unlike pit mines, which scrape away acres of earth, most modern uranium extraction projects drill hundreds of wells, inject them with solvents and suck up the mineral slurry they create. This method has a much lighter impact on the surface but can contaminate or deplete freshwater aquifers if improperly managed.

In Wyoming, several hundred wells churn out a modest 28,000 pounds of uranium oxide per month at the Lost Creek mine. The mine is licensed to produce more than 1.2 million pounds of uranium oxide concentrate annually, according to UR Energy, but uranium miners are still waiting for the development of a domestic nuclear supply chain before ramping up production.

Supply chain bottleneck

For now, American uranium production remains a dribble. Despite recent steep increases, total output in 2024 was less than 2% of the country’s peak production in 1981. The U.S. lacks the infrastructure to transform uranium oxide concentrate, known in the industry as “yellowcake,” into the uranium hexafluoride gas used for enrichment. About 99% of the feedstock consumed by U.S. power plants is imported, and much of that uranium is enriched in Russia, despite the prohibition on importing Russian uranium that then-President Joe Biden signed in May 2024. The ban doesn’t fully go into effect until 2028.

“Uranium mining, uranium processing and uranium enrichment have all largely been offshored because they could do it cheaper,” said Rusty Towell, director of the Nuclear Energy Experimental Testing Laboratory at Abilene Christian University. “That whole supply chain was weakened.”

In the U.S., just one commercial plant converts uranium into the gaseous form required for enrichment and only one commercial plant enriches that gas into nuclear fuel at the scale required to fuel power plants. No facility can produce significant volumes of the higher-grade fuel used by new reactor designs — High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium, or HALEU. That also comes primarily from Russia, though the Department of Energy has posted billions in grant funding for private-sector enrichment projects in the U.S.

“The U.S. [government] is moving very fast on this,” said James Walker, CEO of a startup called Nano Nuclear Energy and a former nuclear engineer at the U.K. Ministry of Defense. “Now the pressure is on everybody to ramp up as fast as they can.”

A whole cluster of advanced nuclear startups like Nano eagerly awaits the availability of American HALEU to begin testing their reactors, and they’ll purchase the new enrichment facilities’ product as soon as it becomes available, Walker said.

However, even a booming domestic market for nuclear fuel doesn’t guarantee that American uranium miners will supply the needed raw material. New enrichment projects could continue to import uranium mined overseas — but government policies are making that harder, including with the Biden administration’s ban on imports of Russian uranium.

“We are making investments to build out a secure nuclear fuel supply chain here in the United States,” the announcement of that ban stated.

This year, Trump imposed tariffs on imports from 70 countries, including the top uranium producers: Kazakhstan, Canada and Namibia.

“As long as we’re keeping that foreign uranium from coming in, then I think there is hope for domestic production,” said Brent Elliott, a geologist with the Bureau of Economic Geology at the University of Texas. But if “we can get it cheaper somewhere else, then that will more likely be the case.”

A flurry of new mines

In Wyoming, home to the nation’s richest known uranium deposits, three other companies have recently joined UR Energy in ramping up operations. To the south, in far western Colorado, Canadian firm Anfield Energy announced plans in August to begin exploratory drilling at an abandoned, 2000-acre uranium pit mine.

In Utah, Anfield’s Velvet-Wood project received an expedited environmental review that lasted just two weeks due to a March executive order from the White House.

“This approval marks a turning point,” said Interior Secretary Doug Burgum in a press release at the time. “By streamlining the review process for critical mineral projects like Velvet-Wood, we’re reducing dependence on foreign adversaries.”

The reviews of several mines in western New Mexico were also fast-tracked and are expected to conclude in late 2027. They include the Crownpoint-Church Rock and La Jara Mesa projects by Australian miner Laramide Resources, as well as Energy Fuels’ Roca Honda project in the Cibola National Forest.

On federal lands, where many of the reopened mines are located, digs for minerals are still governed by the Mining Act of 1872. Originally passed to draw settlers to the West, it declares all mineral deposits “free and open to exploration and purchase.” The law has enabled some mines to open in areas that are culturally important to tribes, critical habitat for vulnerable species or revered for recreational and scenic values, often over local opposition.

Some of the fast-tracked New Mexico mines border the lands of the Acoma and Laguna pueblos. In the nearby Navajo Nation, the new activity has sparked concern.

The Navajo Nation “continues to be affected — not only from abandoned uranium mines and mill sites — but also from other contaminants,” said Perry Charley, chair of the Diné Uranium Remediation Advisory Commission, at a public meeting in August in Shiprock, New Mexico.

From 1944 to 1986, mining activities left more than 500 abandoned mines and an enormous amount of uranium waste in various regions of Navajo land.

Numerous peer-reviewed studies of the Navajo Nation have shown widespread groundwater contamination by uranium, as well as other elements released by the mining process, including arsenic, vanadium, manganese and lithium.

“Though uranium mining ceased on the Navajo Nation in 1986, the contamination left from these operations still represents a significant danger,” said a study from 2019.

Recent studies have linked proximity to abandoned uranium mines with increased risks of autoimmune and cardiovascular diseases on the Navajo Nation. Uranium concentrations in urine samples of Navajo women are almost three times higher than the national median and are associated with significantly increased risks of preterm births, according to studies in 2020 and 2023.

Navajo people’s cancer diagnosis rate is 6.3 times higher for gallbladder cancer, 3.2 times higher for stomach cancer, 1.9 times higher for kidney cancer and 1.8 times higher for liver cancer than white populations in New Mexico and Arizona, according to a 2023 report from the Navajo Epidemiology Center.

On the eastern edge of Navajo land, at the Church Rock site, a dam failure in 1979 released 94 million gallons of waste fluids into the Rio Puerco, the largest radioactive material spill in U.S. history. Church Rock is among the sites currently undergoing expedited environmental review to resume production.

“These communities are still trying to clean up from the last time this happened,” said Amber Reimondo, the energy director at the Grand Canyon Trust, a nonprofit advocating for protection of the Grand Canyon and Colorado Plateau. “For years, tribes have been reassured that the problems of the past are just that — problems of the past — and that now we have environmental laws that are supposedly protecting them.”

At the Navajo reservation’s western edge, uranium production began last year at the Pinyon Plain Mine, nestled among pinyon pine trees in the Baaj Nwaavjo I’tah Kukveni National Monument, less than 20 miles from the Grand Canyon’s south rim in Arizona.

The mine operator, Energy Fuels, began trucking its uranium product through Navajo territory in July 2024, but was forced to stop after the tribal government issued an order banning unauthorized transport of radioactive material.

“Anyone bringing those substances onto the Nation should undertake that activity with respect and sensitivity to the psychological impact to our people, as well as the trauma of uranium development that our community continues to live with every day,” former Navajo Nation Attorney General Ethel Branch said in a statement at the time.

Later, the tribal government and Energy Fuels negotiated an agreement to resume transport of uranium from the Pinyon Plain Mine across the Navajo lands.

“Energy Fuels is pursuing an aggressive plan to quickly increase short-term U.S. uranium supply,” company CEO Mark Chalmers said in a press release this year announcing record production at Pinyon Plain.

Energy Fuels did not respond to requests for comment. The company has a long list of mines it’s working to bring back online across Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming, according to public announcements.

Groundwater concerns

Permitted in 1986, the 14-acre Pinyon Plain Mine sat dormant for decades, like hundreds of other sites in the country, waiting for uranium prices to rebound. When they did, the U.S. Forest Service cleared it to begin operations for the first time last year, although it last cleared federal environmental review almost 40 years ago. The decision prompted protests from local tribes, Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs and Attorney General Kris Mayes.

“We must protect the water supplies,” Mayes said in an August 2024 statement calling for reevaluation of the mine. “The risks are too great to ignore.”

The site contains a single mine shaft extending 1,470 feet down to the uranium deposits, and the company removed millions of gallons of groundwater to access the ore. The mine and others like it pose threats to the region’s network of interconnected aquifers that stretches across the Grand Canyon region, according to research published last year by Karl Karlstrom and Laura Crossey, Emeritus professors of earth science at the University of New Mexico.

“Energy Fuels doesn’t know how much their mining is contaminating the deep aquifer, and USGS doesn’t know, and we don’t know,” Karlstrom said. “Caution is needed.”

In an interview, both researchers said the Pinyon Plain mining plan assumes that two underlying formations holding water, the upper Coconino aquifer and the lower Redwall-Mauv aquifer, aren’t connected. But ample regional science shows that’s not true, they said; water moves between them.

The Redwall-Mauv aquifer feeds springs across the region, some of which provide drinking water for the Havasupai Tribe.

“Current well data are insufficient to rule out a connection between the two aquifers,” wrote the Environmental Protection Agency in a review of the mine following Karlstrom and Crossey’s study. But the agency noted that USGS data from the mine’s well sites show elevated levels of uranium and arsenic contamination, and that it is unclear how or if it will spread.

“The potential for groundwater contamination resulting from operations at the Pinyon Plain Mine site cannot be assessed fully without additional investigations,” the EPA review concluded.

The uranium mining revival has churned up similar concerns in the savannah of South Texas. Encore Energy, based in the Gulf Coast city of Corpus Christi, started production at its Rosita site in November 2023 and its Alta Mesa site in June 2024. In August, it acquired 5,900 more acres adjacent to Alta Mesa, where it plans to begin drilling in October. Another Corpus Christi-based company, Uranium Energy Corp., expects to start mining at its South Texas sites in early 2026.

One rural groundwater conservation district is fighting the renewal of an old, unused mining permit UEC holds for a site in Goliad County.

“We are extremely concerned that UEC’s uranium mining activities will lead to groundwater contamination,” said a request for a hearing on the mine permits filed by the district with Texas’ environmental regulator late last year.

Faultlines and abandoned oil wells connect the mining area to freshwater aquifers, the district claims. Some 30 households, a church and about 400 cattle drink from wells in the area surrounding the mine. Groundwater levels there dropped 15 feet between 2000 and 2022, the district said.

The Goliad site will use about 130 million gallons per year, according to Art Dohmann, vice president of the Goliad County Groundwater Conservation District. But mining is exempt from groundwater permitting requirements under Texas law, he said.

“This may cause more wells in the area to go dry,” the district wrote in comments to the state.

In August, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality voted unanimously to grant the district’s request for a hearing on the permit. UEC did not respond to requests for comment.

Separate state permits authorize UEC to inject up to 105 million gallons of mining wastewater underground for disposal every year at its Goliad site. UEC has four other projects under development in South Texas.

The company, which calls itself “America’s largest and fastest growing supplier of uranium,” also owns sites in New Mexico and Wyoming, where its Christensen Ranch mine began production last summer and its Sweetwater Uranium Complex was selected in August for the fast-tracked approval authorized by President Trump’s executive order.

UEC calls Sweetwater “the largest uranium complex in the U.S.” It encompasses 20,000 acres of exploration and mining rights in Wyoming’s Great Divide Basin, and sits only a few miles from UR Energy’s Lost Creek Mine, where Cash, UR Energy’s CEO, was surveying his company’s project.

Before UEC can even develop the site, the expedited review is expected to take 18 months, according to a federal permitting tracker.

Drilling uranium

On a hot morning in June, three men and a 25-foot-tall winch pulled piping from the ground at the Lost Creek mine in Wyoming. They had just completed a new uranium well.

Cash, a trim man with brown hair lightly graying on the sides, inspected a slab of wood containing samples of wet earth taken every five feet down the well. A chunk he scooped up was a deep green, indicating it probably contained uranium.

“For a geologist, it’s like reading a book,” said Cash, who has a master’s degree in geology and geophysics from Missouri University of Science and Technology.

Lost Creek extracts uranium using in-situ recovery — ISR mining — a process pioneered in Wyoming in the 1960s. Over the eons, water carried uranium off the granite mountains surrounding the Great Divide Basin, burying it in the sandstone. Water is now used to draw it back out. The company drills wells patterned like the five sides of dice and then injects a leachate — water, oxygen, CO2 and occasionally soda ash at UR-Energy’s project, according to Cash — into the exterior four shafts. When that stew is pumped back to the surface through the center pipe, it’s full of uranium.

Wells’ surface impacts bother Cash, he said, looking out over the site. “I wish we could do this with less disturbance.”

But if this were an open-pit mine, a crater would displace the vegetation on the surface and “this would all be gone in perpetuity,” he added. Instead, the company will replant native sagebrush and grasses, Cash said.

Hundreds of wells surrounded the site’s processing facility — a concrete and steel warehouse where employees wearing radiation-monitoring badges oversee chemical processes that turn uranium-filled slurry into yellowcake, the base ingredient of nuclear fuel.

Water that isn’t reused, about 21,600 gallons a day, according to Cash, is treated and disposed of underground.

Lost Creek has detected groundwater contaminated by what the company injects — moving “where it shouldn’t move” — four or five times since 2013, Cash said. If left alone, it could spread to freshwater sources. This is “exceedingly rare,” and each time it has happened, UR Energy has successfully prevented an escape, he said.

Employee and environmental safety are among Cash’s top concerns, but he feels U.S. nuclear regulations often hamper innovation and curb profit margins. He chaffed at the fact that UR Energy was required to install and maintain a full-blown weather station at Lost Creek, and wondered why his company had to take groundwater that was already undrinkable and make it slightly cleaner, but still unpotable, before disposal.

“We need to be protective,” he said. “But we don’t need to be hyper-protective.”

Cash left Lost Creek for another UR Energy project, which would revive the Shirley Basin mine some 80 miles east at the foot of the Laramie Range. On his way that June day, he passed another potential mine, the Lost Soldier project, a claim he isn’t sure the company will ever develop.

“There’s a lot more work we need to do,” Cash said.

The 2025 Sustainability Trends Report highlights a world where the rapid scaling of climate technology often appears at odds with the political headwinds emerging from major world powers.

For manufacturers, the report outlines a period of risk and opportunity. The data points towards a clear direction in the power and transport sectors as clean technologies are scaled quickly and capital follows suit.

Yet global climate politics have entered what the report describes as a “period of retrenchment,” largely influenced by the US. This divergence between technological momentum and political intent is creating a complex environment for businesses to navigate.

US policy reversals and clean tech investment

The report frames 2025 as a stress test of whether global climate action can withstand the disengagement of the US.

According to Generation, the re-elected Trump administration has not only withdrawn from the Paris Agreement but has also moved to strip the federal government of its authority to regulate greenhouse gases.

This action could impair future climate initiatives in the country.

These policy reversals have had a tangible impact on industrial investment. Generation estimates that they have “already triggered cancellations of nearly US$30bn of prospective clean-industry investment in the US,” with further modelling suggesting this figure could reach US$500bn over a decade. This creates a power vacuum that other nations are keen to fill.

The report argues that China is quickly assuming the mantle as the world’s leading force in sustainability, fuelled by its aggressive industrial policy and growing exports of renewable energy technology and electric vehicles (EVs).

Electric vehicle market and manufacturing dynamics

In road transport, Generation sides firmly with the view that electrification is the global North Star.

The report cites International Energy Agency data suggesting electric cars are expected to account for 25% of global auto sales this year.

The contrast between markets is stark. EVs already represent close to 60% of new car sales in China and around a quarter across Europe. The US market is lagging with EVs making up only about 10% of car sales in 2024.

This gap presents challenges and opportunities for automotive manufacturers. Tesla’s once-dominant position began to erode this year, particularly in Europe, where Tesla has suffered double-digit sales declines.

This trend is compounded by the fact that “Chinese brands now offer very affordable models.”

While the passenger vehicle market transforms, decarbonisation in heavy-duty transport is stirring from a small base. The report stresses that infrastructure for high-power charging for eHGVs remains at a “barely-started” stage in most countries.

Industrial decarbonisation and hydrogen hurdles

For years, hydrogen has been presented as a key solution for decarbonising heavy industry. However, Generation believes that, in 2025, the green hydrogen bubble will truly burst.

A substantial share of European projects have been cancelled, with many more shelved as the cost gap between green hydrogen and grey hydrogen produced with fossil fuels remains wide.

The report's authors are blunt in their assessment. They write that the enthusiasm for hydrogen “may have cost us years in which industrial decarbonisation could have been pursued by more practical means” and note that the initial hype was strongly promoted by oil majors.

While hydrogen stumbles, other clean energy sectors are attracting around twice as much investment globally as fossil fuels.

The core message for corporate and financial audiences is that the economics of the transition are pulling one way while politics pushes another. Companies that treat this turbulence as a reason to pause their decarbonisation efforts risk being on the wrong side of what the report calls “the race for the future”.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/04d7a8f6392974fca983138ce7c40053:ddea15a66e79aabc1a6b8b20ca5c3051/gettyimages-1711064473-1.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 13:00:18.411924

Therefore, since it is unacceptable to leave the population completely unprotected, judicial action must be considered—and we are seriously considering it,” she said during her participation in Bom Dia, Ministro, a program run by public broadcaster EBC.

According to the minister, at the very moment society most needs environmental “protection,” Congress has dismantled the legislation meant to ensure it. “It was a demolition of Brazil’s environmental licensing system, a framework that has existed for 50 years at the state level and for 39 years at the federal level, nearly 40 years of consolidation, and one that has prevented hundreds of thousands of tragedies over the decades,” she said.

Silva further stressed that, from now on, with the vetoes overturned, tragedies will be exacerbated, especially in an increasingly challenging context of climate crisis.

Backsliding and loss of control

“The narrative being used—that this is modernization to gain agility—is, in fact, a narrative meant to disguise all these setbacks. These are not setbacks; they are true regressions,” she said.

According to the minister, Congress’s decision may undermine the Mercosur-European Union trade agreement, scheduled to be signed on December 20. “There are already questions arising about whether the environmental commitments that underpin the agreement can be met in light of this change.”

On Thursday, in yet another defeat for the government and amid escalating political tensions, Congress overturned most of Lula’s 63 vetoes to the environmental licensing bill.

All 52 vetoes analyzed were overturned in two voting blocs. With that, much of the new General Environmental Licensing Law (approved by the legislature in July) now takes effect.

Among the most sensitive vetoes for the government that were overturned was the one rejecting the creation of the Licença por Adesão e Compromisso (LAC) for projects with medium environmental impact. It is a self-declared license that does not require review or approval by an environmental agency for a project to proceed.

With the new flexibility, the environment minister noted, developers will be able to obtain a license by simply self-declaring compliance—meaning they themselves assert that they are following the law.

The same applies to the creation of minimum national environment standards against which development applications will be assessed.
The commitment to tighten loopholes that made state-sanctioned native forest logging and agricultural land-clearing effectively exempt from national laws is a significant and necessary win for nature.","We should start at the beginning in assessing the Labor-Greens deal to revamp Australia’s national environment law. And the beginning is that, ideally, you would not start from here.

Despite its name, the 1999 Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act was designed under John Howard to allow developments to go ahead, usually with conditions attached that may limit the damage to nature.

The law does not prioritise environmental protection. It shouldn’t be a shock that it has spectacularly failed to deliver it. There is a case that the best approach would have been to scrap and replace the act.

Labor instead chose to amend the existing legislation, arguing it could improve it for both the environment and business, which has complained of long delays in approval decisions. It means the deal announced on Thursday is a repair job, not a complete rethink of how to best protect Australia’s unique wildlife and wild places as the country faces what scientists say is an extinction crisis.

It is worth noting there was no need for the changes to be rushed through this year. A committee inquiry is still under way. The Greens cut a deal at least in part because they feared if they didn’t, the government’s offer would evaporate and it would be content to make a much weaker agreement, from an environmental perspective, with the Coalition next year. The deadline was only political.

The result is the changes have not had proper scrutiny. The independent senator David Pocock had a point when he described the process as a farce. It means there are likely to be gremlins in the laws that will not be uncovered for a while.

But let’s look at what we do know.

From an environmental perspective: is this deal an improvement on the existing law? In some key ways, clearly yes.

The creation of a national Environment Protection Agency with the power to enforce compliance and apply beefed-up penalties is a step forward – if well used. The same applies to the creation of minimum national environment standards against which development applications will be assessed.

Plenty about the standards is still not known, though. Only two draft standards have been released, with more to come. As with so much of this, the details will matter.

The commitment to tighten loopholes that made state-sanctioned native forest logging and agricultural land-clearing effectively exempt from national laws is a significant and necessary win for nature. The revamp would have been a joke without them.

This change won’t stop logging or land-clearing, but will boost legal and social pressure on the logging industries in Tasmania and New South Wales. Anthony Albanese basically acknowledged this on Thursday, saying the forest industry was increasingly reliant on plantation timber – it already provides nearly 90% of wood in Australia – and that the government would kick in $300m for a “forestry growth fund” as it moved in that direction.

The Greens’ demand that fossil fuel projects cannot be fast-tracked in the way other developments can – renewable energy and housing, for example – makes obvious sense as far as it goes.

It also makes sense that Labor has dropped a proposal to give states and territories the power to make decisions on large coalmining and unconventional gas projects that affect groundwater or waterways under plans to “streamline decision-making”. Water resources are a national issue, and should have federal oversight.

Here the politics get a little murky. Did Labor actually ever really plan to give up power over what is known as the “water trigger”? At least some of the “concessions” to the Greens – the commitment to axe the logging loophole, for example – were steps the government had said it was prepared to make, but held back for the final negotiations.

Similarly, it’s an open question whether the environment minister, Murray Watt, and those around him really believed an agreement could be landed with the divided and self-destructing Coalition, despite repeated claims that he was prepared to make concessions either way. If a deal was done it was always likely to be with the Greens. They don’t call Watt a political fixer for nothing.

Back on the positives: one of the more contentious issues in the debate over the laws has been whether to include a definition of “unacceptable impacts” that should in theory lead to quick “no” decisions on some developments. It stayed in. Again, the details and interpretation will be crucial.

But there are also problems, and many unanswered questions.

The amended laws lean heavily on the use of offsets, which basically allow some nature to be bulldozed as long as other areas are protected. As Guardian Australia’s Lisa Cox has shown, offset schemes have repeatedly not delivered anything like what has been promised.

The government has proposed a “restoration contribution fund” that will allow developers to kick in cash in return for permission to do some environmental damage. This sort of model, which critics have called a “pay-to-destroy” fund, failed spectacularly in NSW. The negotiations with the Greens have introduced some limits, but many people will be sceptical whether the “net gain” for nature that Watt has promised can be guaranteed.

Non-fossil fuel developments will be able to be fast-tracked, with decisions promised in as little as 30 days and in some cases left to the states. The country needs a rapid rollout of renewable energy, but this timeframe risks squashing the rights of communities to test and object to developments.

The laws also maintain the existing approach of giving the environment minister significant discretion over how the act is used. Experts say this includes in some cases the authority to approve developments they consider in the national interest, and a “rulings power” that could limit legal challenges.

Finally, the laws go close to ignoring what will ultimately be the greatest threat to much of the environment – the climate crisis. Developers will have to disclose their expected emissions, but this information will have no bearing on whether a project goes ahead. As has been said many times before, this defies logic.

It means that – even as conservationists celebrate victories that have been the result of years of dedicated campaigning – the arguments over what more is needed to give Australian nature the protection it deserves will continue.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3cc664724e6376ff66f5f578425e07d3bfbc731/439_0_6880_5504/master/6880.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=227b5c08927fb4c29b381881935dee95",N,,2025-11-28 16:00:07.163686

What’s more, the Keystone State’s new budget, like the recent congressional markup, also underscores the fact that permitting reform can garner bipartisan support and advance even where there is divided government.","It’s been an eventful November for 2028 Democratic presidential hopefuls. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker (D), who put more than $25 million of his own fortune into to his campaign fund this month, traveled to the Lone Star State on November 10 to speak to an annual dinner for the Dallas County Democratic Party, where Pritzker was warmly greeted by leading Texas Democrats. The next day, on November 11, California Governor Gavin Newsom (D-Calif.) addressed the global climate conference in Brazil, with his remarks garnering national and international media coverage. Meanwhile, on November 12, Governor Josh Shapiro (D-Pa.) reached a overdue budget agreement with legislative leaders in Harrisburg, one that makes him the first Democratic governor to back away from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a cap-and-trade program comprised of nearly a dozen northeastern and mid-Atlantic states.

While the end of Governor Shapiro’s bid to impose RGGI in Pennsylvania is getting deserved attention, the permitting reforms to which Shapiro agreed are also noteworthy. In particular, Pennsylvania’s new budget expands the number of permits covered by the state’s new Streamlining Permits for Economic Expansion and Development (SPEED) program.

Pennsylvania’s SPEED program, which was authorized by 2024 legislation and launched at the end of June 2025, expedites the review process for certain permits by allowing businesses to pay for private, third-party inspectors to conduct technical reviews. The Commonwealth Foundation, a Pennsylvania-based think tank, notes that the permitting reforms included in the new budget will enable more businesses “to track permits through an online system,” and permits that aren’t processed by the state in a timely manner “would be automatically approved, allowing businesses to start these projects.”

“With the threat of RGGI off the table, a more prosperous future for Pennsylvania’s energy sector can move forward,” said Nathan Benefield, the Commonwealth Foundation’s chief policy officer. “That, combined with ‘deemed approved’ permitting reform, will improve Pennsylvania’s economic outlook.”

As Congress considers permitting reform, such as the federal SPEED Act, state legislative leaders, governors, and 2026 candidates are advocating complementary state-level actions. Take Congressman Tom Tiffany (R-Wisc.), the front-runner to be the GOP gubernatorial nominee in Wisconsin next year, who is now campaigning on the need for permitting reform at both the federal and state levels.

“With rising electricity demand and the need to source more reliable domestic energy and critical minerals, the U.S. must approve and build more power plants, pipelines, mines and export terminals in a timely manner,” Tiffany wrote in a recent op-ed in the Capitol Times, which he coauthored with Gabriella Hoffman, director of Independent Women’s Center for Energy and Conservation. “The U.S. can continue to uphold its strict environmental and labor standards while speeding up the lengthy and litigious permitting process.”

“While permitting reform is viewed as the sole responsibility of the federal government, states like Wisconsin have a responsibility to participate in the process,” Tiffany and Hoffman added, noting that three-quarters of permits authorized under federal law are issued by state governments. “Moreover, the Foundation for American Innovation’s State Permitting Playbook notes places like Wisconsin boast ‘significant autonomy and flexibility in implementing and enforcing environmental laws’ like the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Endangered Species Act.”

“Unfortunately, Gov. Tony Evers’ Task Force on Climate Change — born from an October 2019 executive order — could hold Wisconsin back from maximizing its potential since it prioritizes climate change over permitting reform,” Tiffany and Hoffman warn. “The governor’s overreliance on renewables like solar and wind, not reliable energy, won’t meet this moment.”

Back in Washington, days after Governor Shapiro signed into law permitting reform as part of a new state budget, the U.S. House Committee on Natural Resources held a full committee markup for three permitting reform bills, including the aforementioned federal SPEED Act. Congressman Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.), chairman of the committee, touted the markup as “an important bipartisan step toward lowering energy prices for hardworking Americans and building critical projects.”

“The increasing demand for electricity and critical minerals is fueling new investments, and federal permitting laws must keep up,” Chairman Westerman added in a statement issued after last week’s markup. “The SPEED Act eliminates bureaucratic delays that hinder projects and restores NEPA to its original purpose. The Committee’s bipartisan support for NEPA reform is a victory for government efficiency, economic growth, national security, transportation infrastructure and lower energy bills for Americans. I thank my colleagues for their hard work on the bills we advanced, and I look forward to advancing them through the legislative process.”

The ongoing buildout of AI-dedicated data centers, which are more energy intensive than traditional data centers, translates into increased demand for electricity that, unless accompanied by a corresponding expansion of power generating capacity, will drive up consumer energy costs. Earlier this year, Goldman Sachs Research estimated that power usage for the global data center market would grow 165% by 2030 relative to 2023. While data centers presently consume 55 gigawatts (GW) of power, Goldman Sachs Research projects that 122 GW of data center capacity will be online by the end of this decade.

“As data centers contribute to a growing need for power, the electric grid will require significant investment,” Goldman Sachs Research noted in February, estimating that such an increase in demand would necessitate $720 billion in new spending to expand electricity generation and transmission infrastructure. “These transmission projects can take several years to permit, and then several more to build, creating another potential bottleneck for data center growth if the regions are not proactive about this given the lead time,” noted James Schneider, a Goldman Sachs senior equity research analyst who focuses on US telecom, digital infrastructure, and IT services.

As federal permitting reform awaits further consideration in Congress and ultimately a floor vote, the recent changes included in Pennsylvania’s new budget, along with Congressman Tiffany’s comments on the gubernatorial campaign trail in Wisconsin, demonstrate there are actions that state officials can take in the near term to advance permitting reform that will help achieved the needed expansion. What’s more, the Keystone State’s new budget, like the recent congressional markup, also underscores the fact that permitting reform can garner bipartisan support and advance even where there is divided government.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/691f6523c471f0f86bae02aa/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-11-28 13:00:27.863298

While we’ve picked out some broadly positive points for industry around energy relief, skills investment, R&D backing, and infrastructure support, this is a budget that appears to have “fallen flat” with a number of leaders.

Has this Chancellor damaged her reputation with the business community to the point of no repair? Henry Anson, Director of The Manufacturer, appears briefly on this week’s episode to have his say.

While we rarely go as far to suggest any government policy is moronic, such impassioned criticism is saved for our ‘Made by a Moron’ section. This week – cable cars and Joe’s porcelain bathroom tiles.

The Budget

Wednesday’s Budget addressed the immediate financial pressures facing manufacturers. In response to calls from industry groups like Make UK, the government came forward with plans to cut electricity prices for manufacturing businesses.

From 2027, the British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme (BICS), will reduce electricity bills for over 7,000 UK manufacturers by up to 25% for eligible businesses.

But questions are still unanswered over which companies qualify for this relief. So far, “frontier” industries like automotive and aerospace, and supply-chain/foundational sectors such as chemicals have been outlined.

And for the most energy-intensive firms, the existing support under the British Industry Supercharger is being boosted, with discounts on electricity network charges moving from 60% to 90% next year.

But eligibility rules aren’t yet final, with a consultation currently open. Critics of this point out that there are some companies that need energy relief immediately, to the point where they may no longer exist if help doesn’t come until 2027, or even next year.

The Budget continues to back the priorities of the government’s 10-year Industrial Strategy. That means sustained support for advanced manufacturing, clean energy, and associated growth industries.

Defence spending is set to increase, underscored by the government’s earlier commitment to intervene and save British Steel and buy British when it is crucial to national security.

There will also be extending support to the automotive industry’s zero-emission and next-gen technologies via the DRIVE 35 programme, increasing the capital & R&D funding envelope through 2035.

Some positive news was also given on apprenticeships, with the government allocating £725 million for the new Growth and Skills Levy.

Under the new Levy, for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), apprenticeships for people under 25 will be fully funded, meaning training costs will be covered with no co-investment required.

We asked leaders in industry for their reaction

Falling short on growth

Three leading figures from the sector have delivered a damning verdict on the Budget, warning it fails to address the fundamental challenges facing the industry.

Graham Corfield of Aviramp, Jennifer Hughes of Transicon, and Craig Pyser from AMufacture have their say.

Criticism varies from the opinions that taxes won’t lead to growth but will put further pressures on business, through to general economic outlook “remaining flat” within the sector.",https://themanufacturer-cdn-1.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/28103103/Main-Podcast-Cover.png,N,,2025-11-28 16:59:29.817913

“We agree that burying trash forever is not the perfect solution, but I’m often uncomfortable with unsolicited proposals that have no prior operating standard,” County Manager Chris Coudriet said at the commissioners’ Nov. 17 meeting. “I don’t believe that the county should be on the avant garde of how to deal with solid waste.”

However, Neil Williams and Stuart Cooke, behind MEP/EnviRemed Environmental, claim their proposal — essentially turning waste into a gas that can be converted into fuel — is supported by several environmental agencies and working in several locales.

“It’s a chance for the county to lead again, proving that environmental protection and economic strength can go hand-in-hand,” Cooke said.

Cooke — a local who is the brother of Brunswick County Commissioner Marty Cooke — told commissioners he has located two potential sites off N.C. Highway 421 for the proposed gasification facility, as well as a property just over the border in Brunswick County.

The representatives are seeking a contract with the county to dispose of landfill’s trash through gasification. The process uses a combination of electricity and high heat to break down trash to its molecular level — no burning involved — and convert it into syngas. The gas can then be used for fuel, electricity, hydrogen and more.

The process does create a byproduct called “slag,” which looks like glass or rock. Theoretically, this can be used in road-paving or other construction materials.

“The system is fully self-contained — no wastewater, no runoff, no contamination … air emissions are about 100 times lower than the federal standards, making this one of the cleanest waste energy systems in existence,” Cooke said.

He claimed 95% of what would go through its facility — municipal solid waste, hazardous waste, agricultural waste, medical waste, plastics, construction debris and sewer sludge — will be turned into gas. The remaining 5% will be delivered to the landfill.

Conserving landfill space is a draw for New Hanover County, whose landfill has an estimated 23 years left in its lifespan. Both expanding the landfill, if that’s even possible with New Hanover County’s dwindling available acreage, and trucking waste to other sites would come with high costs.

“My initial reaction is that this sounds great; it sounds like a very interesting proposition that I would like to explore further,” Commissioner Dane Scalise said.

Cooke shared his team has been working with the county on a proposal for more than a year — “just so that they could vet us as far as from their foxhole,” he said. The county asked the company to seek guidance from the North Carolina Division of Environmental Quality, which recommended the proposal for New Hanover County.

Commissioner Rob Zapple questioned whether Cooke had that in writing.

“That may be strong terminology,” Cooke countered. “I appreciate the question — what they did was they started skeptical. They brought everybody from all facets of their organization to a meeting that took three months, and we all had a large room, and they took us through the soup to nuts about what we’re proposing for New Hanover County. Based on that meeting, they said: ‘This sounds great, especially for an application like New Hanover County.’”

However, without county staff’s endorsement, the commissioners weren’t comfortable accepting solicitation without further staff research and identification of other solutions. Coudriet and Joe Suleyman, director of the county’s recycling and solid waste department, advocated for a wider call for proposals; additionally, Suleyman said he was concerned about the engineers’ ability to follow through on the proposed plan.

“We have not identified any comparable gasification facilities that process the amount of municipal solid waste being proposed, so the likelihood of success remains uncertain,” he said.

Cooke claimed the facility would be able to process the 1,000 tons coming into the county’s landfill per day, though Suleyman said that number is more like 2,000 in an 2023 interview.

There doesn’t appear to be a facility in the U.S. processing that amount. There is a demonstration plant in Durham, North Carolina, though the facility only processes municipal solid waste.

Cooke pointed to a Dubai gasification plant, the largest in the world, converting 6,000 tons a day to synthetic fuel. Another facility exists in Spain, processing 1,270 tons per day.

The technology is more emergent in the United States. Williams attributed it to a rise in diesel costs 10 years ago, from which the country is still recovering.

Aries Clean Technologies is planning to open a gasification plant to treat municipal wastewater in Linden, New Jersey, while an InEnTec plant converting waste to hydrogen was just finished in Arlington, Oregon. Both will process less than 1,000 tons a day.

These facilities often require high initial investments — the New Jersey gasification facility cost $65 million, $55 million of which were financed with tax-exempt bonds through the Union County Improvement Authority. Operational costs also remain hard to find, as the technology is in the beginning stages in the U.S.

However, the MEP/EnviRemed Environmental representatives said they are not looking for county investment.

“If anything were to happen to us at any time for any reason that we can no longer perform, you still have full control of your landfill,” Cooke said. “Nothing changes. You still continue to be able to operate just exactly as you do today.”

The commissioners and county staff agreed to keep the gasification proposal on the table for potential landfill solutions, Coudriet saying the goal is to identify a plan in the next six months to a year.

Yes, frequent policy changes in solar manufacturing creates uncertainty for investors.","In an exclusive interview with Mercom, Manish Gupta, Chairman at INA Solar, shared his insights about the rapidly changing landscape of solar manufacturing and his company’s plans to meet the ever-growing demand of the Indian solar industry.

What is INA Solar’s current solar module manufacturing capacity? What are the company’s plans for solar cell manufacturing?

At INA Solar, we have always believed that innovation, quality, and scale are the pillars that define a world-class solar manufacturing company. Over the years, we have strategically built our manufacturing capabilities to cater to both India’s rapidly growing renewable energy requirements and the global solar market.

We operate three manufacturing units in Jaipur with a combined solar module production capacity of 5.5 GW. Our most recent facility at Sawarda, Jaipur, adds 4.5 GW of AI and robotics-driven capacity dedicated to high-efficiency TOPCon and mono PERC modules.

We are also investing in advanced architectures, such as TOPCon, M10R, and G12R, supported by a strong in-house R&D team focused on efficiency, durability, and sustainable manufacturing.

To expand upstream, INA Solar is developing a new plant in Madhya Pradesh with 4.5 GW of G12R N-Type TOPCon solar cell manufacturing capacity. Our total footprint is projected to reach 7 GW of modules, 4.5 GW of solar cells, and 18,000 MTA of aluminum frames.

What steps do you believe are essential to prepare India for the proposed ALMM mandate on wafers and ingots by 2028?

The proposed ALMM mandate on wafers and ingots by 2028 provides India with a crucial lead time to build a strong domestic upstream ecosystem. While short-term costs may rise due to limited local ingot-wafer capacity, the transition window enables manufacturers to scale sustainably.

To prepare for ALMM List-III, the essential steps include rapidly building domestic ingot-wafer capacity to reduce import reliance and balancing domestic and global supply during the transition.

We must also design lines that can handle multiple wafer sizes and specs, increase automation, yields, and cost efficiency, and work with MNRE to secure incentives and financing for upstream investments.

How do you view the current state of Indian solar manufacturing? What policy interventions or industry measures are needed to enhance global competitiveness?

India’s solar manufacturing sector has expanded rapidly over the past 18 to 24 months, driven largely by the production-linked incentive (PLI) program and strong growth in module production capacity. However, domestic manufacturing of cells, wafers, and ingots still falls short of market demand. Challenges such as fragmented supply chains and an inverted duty structure continue to put pressure on production costs and working capital for manufacturers.

Several policy interventions are needed to enhance global competitiveness. Addressing the inverted duty structure and input tax credit (ITC) blockage would significantly ease cash-flow constraints for manufacturers. Strengthening PLI support for upstream segments, such as ingots, wafers, and cells, is essential to achieving full value-chain integration. Stable ALMM timelines and consistent procurement rules would reduce uncertainty for investors and developers. Additionally, enabling low-cost, long-term financing for upstream projects and supporting exports through targeted incentives and trade diplomacy would help Indian manufacturers compete internationally.

On the industry side, companies must prioritize backward integration supported by strong global technology partnerships. Building flexible, standardized production lines, adopting higher levels of automation, improving yields, and meeting international certification standards will be critical to long-term competitiveness. Developing supplier clusters and localized ecosystems can help reduce dependency on imports, while investing in R&D and workforce skilling will strengthen technological self-reliance.

How will the recent reduction of GST on solar cells from 12% to 5% affect manufacturers, considering that issues related to the inverted duty structure and accumulated input tax credit persist?

The reduction in GST on solar cells from 12% to 5% is positive for boosting demand and reducing project costs. However, for manufacturers, the benefit is limited because the inverted duty structure remains unresolved.

Input materials, such as glass, EVA, backsheets, and frames, are still subject to a 12%-18% GST, while the final product is taxed at only 5%. This widens the gap between input tax paid and output tax collected, leading to large accumulated ITC, blocked working capital, higher effective production costs, and reduced margins, especially for small and mid-sized manufacturers.

So, while the GST cut supports installations, its impact on manufacturing competitiveness is minimal unless paired with solutions such as input GST rationalization or ITC refund mechanisms.

With ALMM mandates extending to cells, wafers, and ingots, do you foresee a potential shortage of skilled workers across the solar value chain? What measures are needed to develop technical talent at scale?

A talent shortage is likely as ALMM requirements expand to include cells, wafers, and ingots by 2028. India has strong expertise in module assembly, but the talent pool for the upstream stages of the solar value chain, such as ingot pulling, wafering, and advanced cell manufacturing, is relatively limited.

The key skill gaps include crystal growth, wafer slicing, cell manufacturing processes such as diffusion, metallization, and passivation, as well as automation and robotics, equipment maintenance, and advanced quality-control techniques.

To build talent at scale, India needs to establish dedicated solar manufacturing training centres with industry-led curricula tailored to upstream technologies. Strengthening collaboration between academia and industry through specialized electives, laboratory facilities, and apprenticeship programs will also be critical. Upskilling the existing module-line workforce through bridge programs and hands-on training can help create a pipeline of workers ready for more advanced manufacturing roles.

Forming technology partnerships with global leaders, particularly those that include embedded training modules, will accelerate capability building. Additionally, developing national skill standards and offering incentives for companies that invest in workforce development can help drive systematic improvement across the sector.

Frequent policy changes in solar manufacturing are often seen as a source of uncertainty. How do you think investors perceive this volatility, and what actions could help strengthen their confidence?

Yes, frequent policy changes in solar manufacturing creates uncertainty for investors. While the intent is positive, unpredictability in ALMM timelines, BCD/GST changes, and incentive structures affects long-term planning in a capital-intensive sector.

Investors generally view this volatility through several lenses. First, it creates ambiguity about demand because frequent shifts in ALMM and duty timelines make it difficult to forecast market conditions accurately. Second, sudden changes in tariffs or GST rates introduce financial unpredictability, disrupting cost models and affecting expected IRRs. Third, global partners tend to remain cautious when execution timelines or regulatory frameworks change frequently, which affects their confidence in market stability.

To strengthen investor confidence, several actions can be taken. Establishing a clear long-term policy roadmap, ideally spanning eight to ten years, for ALMM, duties, and incentives would provide much-needed visibility. Better coordination among MNRE, the Ministry of Finance, and the Directorate General of Foreign Trade could help prevent conflicting regulations. Providing stable duty and tax structures with multi-year visibility, along with resolved inverted duty issues, would further reduce uncertainty. Ensuring faster and more transparent PLI disbursement through time-bound approvals and payouts would also help.

Which solar module technologies is INA prioritizing? Which technologies are likely to gain prominence in India and globally in the near to mid-term?

INA Solar is prioritizing N-Type TOPCon technology as the next-generation standard for high-efficiency solar modules. Among the currently available technologies, such as PERC, N-Type TOPCon, and HJT, we believe N-Type TOPCon will capture a major market share and remain commercially viable for a longer tenure, owing to its higher efficiency, better temperature coefficient, and compatibility with existing PERC manufacturing infrastructure.

Ongoing technological advancements at the laboratory level are expected to strengthen N-Type TOPCon’s performance and process stability, ensuring continued support for existing infrastructure and protecting investors’ interests.

Within the N-Type family, INA Solar anticipates that G12R will be the leading format for large-scale adoption. Accordingly, the company has chosen to advance with G12R-based N-Type TOPCon technology and is in the process of establishing a 4.5 GW solar cell production facility at Narmadapuram, Madhya Pradesh.

From a broader perspective, N-Type TOPCon is expected to dominate both the Indian and global PV markets in the near to mid-term. At the same time, HJT and perovskite tandem technologies may gain traction over the longer term as manufacturing processes mature and become more cost-competitive.

Project developers often raise concerns about the quality of domestically manufactured solar modules. As a manufacturer, how do you address these concerns?

At INA Solar, we understand that quality is the most important factor for project developers. Our production lines are fully automated and equipped with advanced machinery, ensuring accuracy and consistency at every step. Each module undergoes several levels of inspection, from raw materials to the final product, ensuring that only the best reaches our customers.

We strictly follow internationally recognized standards, such as IEC, BIS, and ALMM, and our in-house testing facilities verify modules for performance, durability, and long-term reliability. Our R&D and quality teams collaborate closely with technology partners to continually improve materials and processes.

By maintaining transparency and traceability throughout production, we ensure our modules deliver the performance and reliability developers expect, demonstrating that Indian manufacturers can meet global quality standards.",https://d382rz2cea0pah.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Manish-Sir_recent-copy.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 16:59:33.066772

A spokesperson with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services sent a statement to WRAL:

""The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) is moving swiftly to distribute annual awards and restore essential services that were stalled when the Democrat-led shutdown obstructed the Department’s ability to serve the nation’s most vulnerable families.”

A source told WRAL the funding is expected to be released by the end of November.

COP30 in Belém, Brazil, opened under a shadow of geopolitical absence and dwindling scientific optimism. For the first time, the US did not send a delegation, and both the US’ and China’s (the world’s largest emitters of CO2) heads of state were absent from the negotiations. At the same time, new research published just before the summit suggests that the 1.5°C (and even 2°C) targets are slipping out of reach. Against this backdrop, negotiations became long and tense, and ultimately delivered a shaky deal.

Phasing out fossil fuels: a partial pledge without a concrete roadmap

The summit’s final Belém Package stopped short of delivering a binding, time-bound roadmap for fossil fuel phase-out. While draft decisions had included specific references to said phase-out, the final decision refers only to the ‘UAE Consensus’ from COP28 in Dubai – vague language that lacks specificity and only commits to planning an eventual transition away from fossil fuel usage.

While over 80 countries supported an initiative to draw up a fossil fuel transition roadmap, this was ultimately relegated to an informal process, separate from the formal UN negotiating text. That omission represents a missed opportunity: Africa, which contributes only about 3% of global emissions yet bears disproportionate climate risk, cannot simply leap to a low-carbon future without a clear, financed pathway out of fossil dependency.

Nonetheless, there was grounds for cautious optimism: COP30 established a Just Transition Mechanism, meant to support regions whose economies rely heavily on fossil fuel revenues (among them African oil producers and exporters) through tailored packages for economic diversification, social protection for affected workers, and investment in skills, technology transfer and clean-energy industries.

Access to electricity and clean energy remains a sticking point

In Belém, the Action Agenda (COP30’s implementation-oriented framework that mobilises non-party actors such as businesses, cities, investors, civil society and subnational governments) saw a wave of voluntary commitments. Public utility companies pledged $66 billion annually for renewables, and $82 billion for transmission and storage – important, concrete steps toward closing Africa’s and developing regions’ energy access gaps.

Yet the absence of a firm, legally binding fossil fuel phase-out undermines the clarity and security of the transition. Africa needs not only private and philanthropic pledges but predictable concessional finance and policy guarantees that can support off-grid, utility-scale, and mini-grid clean energy systems for underserved populations.

Just a day after the closing of COP30, this year’s G20 summit hosted in Johannesburg, South Africa, from 22-23 November 2025 (making it the first G20 summit on African soil), emphasised strengthening climate resilience, disaster recovery and adaptation in Africa. G20 leaders endorsed the Mission 300 partnership between the World Bank and the AfDB to provide electricity to 300 million Africans by 2030 and expand access to clean cooking.

The G20’s final declaration also welcomed the voluntary, non-binding G20 Critical Minerals Framework, aimed at strengthening sustainable and resilient mineral value chains and increasing local processing and investment in developing, mineral-rich countries.

Major wins for adaptation finance and the Global Goal on Adaptation

COP30 delivered several major wins on the adaptation agenda:

• Increasing adaptation finance: Parties agreed to ‘at least triple’ adaptation finance by 2035.

• Baku Adaptation Roadmap: The Belém Package formalised a roadmap for 2026-2028, laying the groundwork for greater coherence and implementation until the next Global Stocktake of the Paris Agreement.

• Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA): For the first time, a set of 59 voluntary, non-prescriptive indicators was agreed, covering water, food, health, ecosystems, infrastructure, livelihoods, finance, capacity, and technology.

• Tropical Rainforest Forever Fund (TFFF): This Brazil-led initiative, from which African rainforests would benefit as well, launched with $6.6 billion, making it the largest financial instrument of its kind.

However, the financing commitment is deferred to 2035, and the indicators remain voluntary, which risks dilution, uneven application, and under-resourced national plans. Without strong follow-through, Africa may once again be left behind in translating resilience goals into concrete protection for its most climate-vulnerable communities.

Scaling-up and reform of international climate finance architecture reconfirmed

Africa’s loss and damage needs received acknowledgment: COP30 operationalised and confirmed replenishment cycles for the Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage, with payouts to affected countries starting in 2026. But for many African states, loss and damage is not future risk, but represents acute reality. This funding window must be scaled rapidly and disbursed with direct access, transparency and speed.

On the wider finance architecture, COP30 reconfirmed the scaling-up of climate finance flows to $1.3 trillion annually by 2035 through the Baku-to-Belém Roadmap. The roadmap outlines five priority ‘Rs’:

• Replenishing grants and concessional capital,

• Rebalancing debt sustainability,

• Rechanneling private finance,

• Revamping capacity,

• Reshaping the global system for more equitable flows.

Crucially for Africa, the Belém Package calls for reform of multilateral development banks, enhanced role for grant-based instruments, blended finance, guarantees and debt-for-climate swaps. These proposals echo the continent’s pre-COP demands for a fairer financial architecture, not only more monetary pledges.

Still, critics warn the roadmap risks being non-binding if not backed by strong accountability mechanisms. To deliver for Africa and other developing regions, the pledge must translate into trustable flows, manageable terms, and accessible structures.",https://mo.ibrahim.foundation/core/misc/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-28 12:00:27.846792

The collaboration utilises a facility powered by wind energy, underscoring a growing trend of using renewable-powered data centres for energy-intensive operations like bitcoin mining and AI.

It also enhances Soluna's portfolio as a developer of renewable-powered data centres and aids Canaan’s expansion in North America by providing access to cost-effective and dependable infrastructure.

“Soluna is thrilled to develop this new partnership with an industry leader like Canaan,” explains John Belizaire, CEO of Soluna.

""This agreement reflects our shared commitment to delivering high-performance computing solutions powered by renewable energy. With Project Dorothy 2 now online and operational, we're doubling down on our mission to make renewable energy a global superpower.”

Prioritising efficiency

The deployment is scheduled for the first quarter of 2026 and will feature Canaan’s Avalon A15 XP miners, representing approximately one exahash per second (EH/s) of computing power.

These miners are designed for operational efficiency, which aligns with Soluna’s sustainability goals. Their installation at the wind-powered Project Dorothy facility reinforces the focus on renewable energy shared by both companies.

Project Dorothy operates primarily using behind-the-meter wind power, meaning it uses electricity generated on-site. The approach avoids transmitting the power through the main electrical grid.

The facility also maintains a connection to the grid, which helps ensure operational stability and constant uptime – allowing consistent performance while managing costs.

“Our partnership with Soluna is another significant step in advancing our North American self-mining strategy,” says Nangeng Zhang, Chairman and CEO of Canaan. “Each of the partnerships that we have entered into brings a new dimension to our efforts to expand within the region, and we are excited to work with Soluna and utilise their cutting-edge data centre.”

Nangeng continues: “The site primarily runs on behind-the-meter wind power but can also draw from the grid to ensure very high uptime. This is a unique advantage that combines reliable operations with compelling cost efficiency.

“Coupling our efficient and resilient Avalon A15 XP miners with Soluna's infrastructure should be a win for both companies.”

Monetising green energy with digital infrastructure

Project Dorothy is a component of Soluna’s larger strategy to build out its renewable-powered digital infrastructure. The company is currently developing over 2.8GW of renewable computing projects.

Each project is designed to monetise surplus clean energy by providing power for high-compute operations such as bitcoin mining and AI.

By matching renewable energy generation with computational demand, Soluna addresses two distinct challenges.

The first is the curtailment of renewable energy, a situation where excess power is generated but cannot be utilised by the grid.

The second is the increasing need for scalable infrastructure capable of hosting energy-intensive digital processes. The Texas facility serves as a practical example of how renewable-powered data centres can meet the computational demands of advanced technologies while supporting sustainability targets.

Strategic partnership for North American expansion

For Soluna, this collaboration with Canaan is an important step in scaling its renewable-powered business model. With its Project Dorothy 2 site now operational, Soluna is using partnerships with technology firms as a central part of its strategy to monetise its growing capacity pipeline.

The agreement also supports Canaan’s goal of strengthening its presence in North America, where demand for efficient blockchain infrastructure is growing.

By partnering with renewable energy operators like Soluna, Canaan secures access to sustainable and cost-effective locations for deploying its advanced hardware.

Both organisations share an objective to demonstrate that energy-intensive digital workloads can be supported by renewable energy at a significant scale.

Their joint effort illustrates how industry partnerships can lead to the development of efficient and environmentally conscious infrastructure.

Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) introduced legislation on Nov. 20 that would prohibit the use of federal funds or tax credits to support solar panel development on productive farmland. The Protecting American Farmland Act mirrors legislation introduced in the House in May by Rep. Dave Taylor (R-OH). The bills effectively reverse tax and funding support for solar investments created under President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act.

Solar Arrays Undermining US Farmers

More than mere ideological posturing is at stake. Lucrative government subsidies and tax credits created by the Inflation Reduction Act distorted agricultural markets across many regions of the country as solar developers competed with crop farmers for land purchases and leases. The income from solar field arrays, augmented by government support, far exceeded the earnings of commodity farmers, pushing up land and lease costs.

It is not clear if Biden intended to displace actual farmers for sun-collecting technologies justified by a supposed carbon dioxide-fueled climate crisis, but that has been the effect. Farmers were already struggling with high costs for fertilizers, equipment, and especially land. Driving up land prices and lease costs prioritized solar panels above food production.

For years, greenwashing – when an organization or manufacturer promotes or advertises a product as being more environmentally friendly than it truly is – has employed the misnomer “solar farms” to refer to vast ground-mounted facilities that displace food-growing farms. Greenwashing articles crowed about the benefits to soils and biodiversity from solar installations, and others touted sheep grazing under the shade of solar arrays as a nifty efficiency.

A Greenwashing Ruse

But this has been, as President Donald Trump has rightly called it, a scam. Improved soil health and biodiversity result not from installing solar panels but from ceasing to apply pesticides and glyphosate to the land. Pollinators return, plant diversity soars, and soils are replenished by decaying plant matter. The solar panels have nothing to do with this effect, though one day they will have to be disposed of – an ecotoxic nightmare never discussed in the literature.

The idyllic pics of sheep grazing under the comfort of (likely Chinese-manufactured and US taxpayer-funded) solar panels are a similar greenwashing ruse. It’s not like sheep need housing made of sheets of plastic tech manufactured using massive coal plants: They do fine under trees or wooden structures for shade. Sheep flocks in the United States have been steadily declining for decades, and most Americans don’t even eat lamb. There are not nearly enough sheep in the nation to service the explosion of solar arrays constructed. The idea that solar panels will “coexist” with food production is just a marketing palliative for solar installers, investors, and manufacturers.

One doesn’t see pictures of cows under solar panels because they either don’t fit or they’d rub against and destroy the things. Presumably, that would be called a “solar stampede,” and it wouldn’t be profitable for the investors who are raping US farmland for short-term profits.

Reducing Food Inflation Requires Investment in Farmers

It takes years to reclaim neglected farmland, and very little time to make it unusable with technocratic graft like the Inflation Reduction Act, which even Biden conceded was really about funding renewable energy, not reducing inflation. Food prices increase when farmland prices rise, as farmers pass along rising land and lease costs to commodity prices and in turn to grocery store shelves. Consumers will blame Trump for the result of Biden’s ill-considered renewable energy spending spree.

The Protecting American Farmland Act eliminates several favorable tax benefits for investors in solar projects. However, the changes are prospective: Existing installations are grandfathered and will continue to receive taxpayer subsidies while farmers sit out in the cold.",https://www.libertynation.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2241255015-solar.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 15:00:38.715354

It seems like everyone and his brother-in-law is running for California Governor nowadays, and a week ago we got another one: progressive billionaire and climate champion Tom Steyer. One might think that this should be cause for celebration from environmentalists.

Steyer is a good man. He has poured money into progressive causes and charities, as well as important state ballot measures. He has put the climate agenda front and center. So then what’s the problem?

In short, the problem is power.

It takes time and resources to build power. Elections are not won on Election Day – they are won weeks, months, and years (and sometimes even decades) in advance.

They are not won by individual campaigns for specific offices.

That is especially true in Deep Blue California. Consider me skeptical that a Steyer Governorship will be that much different from, say, a Swalwell Governorship, or a Villaraigosa Governorship, or a Yee Governorship, or a Porter Governorship, or even a Newsom Governorship (although unlike Newsom Steyer will not go out of his way to throw powerless minorities under the bus).

What does it mean to build power? It means building mechanisms that change politics. It means being someone like, say Harlan Crow – whom no one had heard of until it became clear that he has been bankrolling Clarence Thomas for years. More importantly, Crow has built institutions: he founded the Club For Growth, which has made the Republican Party’s central policy dogma advancing tax breaks for billionaires, and which invests in right-wing candidates through the country. He has served on the board of the American Enterprise Institute. The Koch Brothers are famous for doing the same sorts of activities: they founded the Cato Institute, Americans for Prosperity and Citizens for a Sound Economy. And of course they have also bankrolled such climate-denying institutions as the Heartland Institute, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, the Pacific Legal Foundation, and the American Legislative Exchange Council. Those institutions exist, and are powerful, and wield enormous influence electorally

Now, it’s not like Steyer doesn’t do these things, but not nearly as much. Back in 2013, he began a youth-oriented political organizing institution, NextGen Climate (now NextGen America), but seems to have lost interest in it several years ago. He is not mentioned on its website. A Google search finds only two references to it in the last year – a time when organizing has been incredibly crucial. A mobilize.us search comes up completely empty for the organization. His efforts are mostly one-offs: when the Koch Brothers attempted to repeal California’s climate law through the ballot box, Steyer organized against it and cleaned their clocks.

But then he got distracted, running for President in 2020, spending a quarter of a billion dollars on his campaign, placing seventh in Iowa, and sixth in New Hampshire, and not garnering a single delegate.

Just think about what that quarter of a billion dollars could have done, and still could do, if it were focused not on a particular race.

Let me give an example: precinct chairs.

In Texas – a state where Democrats must become competitive in order to build a pro-environmental majority – precinct chairs are a big deal. They organize voting on a neighborhood level and (try) to get people to vote. As Michelle H. Davis explained last year:

One Texas County in 2018 did an experiment on which voters were contacted and which weren’t.

70% of voters contacted by their precinct chair turned out to vote.

In precincts where there was no chair, and voters weren’t contacted, only 38% of voters showed up to vote.

This is why precinct chairs are paramount in flipping Texas.

There are more than 4,000 GOP precinct chairs in Texas, and roughly 3,000 Democratic ones. So right there, you can see that the Republican Party is out-organizing the Democrats. What’s more, says Davis:

The Republican Party treats precinct chairs as royalty. Precinct Chairs have tons of support and training and are highly regarded within the GOP. Texas Republicans throw balls for precinct chairs and give out awards. Many GOP precinct chair races are competitive, meaning multiple people run for one chair position.

The GOP’s precinct chair strategy also involves rigorous training on recruiting and involving neighbors. Within a precinct, the chair usually has block captains and up to five volunteers, getting the word out about elections and getting to the polls.

The Democratic Party – not so much. And that is why we just keep missing in Texas. We are getting beaten on the ground. As Davis notes, Texas isn’t a red state: it’s a non-voting state. If we can get more people there to vote, we can win.

That would require money. A lot of money. And a lot of money spent the right way – not on fancy consultants who cream off funds spend on television ads, but on actually organizing people on the ground. Hmmmm….where could that money come from? Perhaps from someone who wasted a quarter of billion dollars in 2020, and looks to do the same in 2026.

That’s what it means to build power: build organizations to reach people and change political outcomes. It does not mean to run what looks sadly like a sort of vanity race where the policy and political differences between Democrats lie between the 49-yard lines, and Freud’s notion of the Narcissism of Small Differences will become a central there.

The Koch Brothers and Harlan Crow and Elon Musk and Peter Thiel and the rest of them want to dominate government and turn the country and world into some sort of Ayn Randian dystopia. But they are (or in David Koch’s case, were) thinking about how to do this. They understood that they didn’t need to run for office to do it, and it was better for them not to run for office to do it. Better to own politicians than to be one. Elon Musk didn’t run for office: he bought Twitter and turned it into a supercharger for resurgent American Nazism. The Office doesn’t matter. Power does.

Look, I like Steyer. A lot. As I said, he’s a good man, and not stupid. He’s done a lot of really good work. If he turns out to be the last Democrat standing, I will gladly support him and work for him – I might even do it if he is only one of two last Democrats standing. But the environment will not win this way. The climate will not heal this way. And we are running out of time.",https://legal-planet.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Tom_Steyer_by_Gage_Skidmore-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 13:00:51.037350

And that’s what legislation like the Affordable, Reliable, and Clean Energy Security Act accomplishes: It reflects the voters’ desire to balance cost with reliability and environmental stewardship.","This is no accident: Electricity costs are skyrocketing, and affordability is top of mind for Americans. The U.S. Energy Information Administration reports average retail revenues per kWh increased in 46 states since last August. Those rates vary significantly from state to state, from a 23% increase in Maine to an 8% decrease in Hawaii.

Looking at American households, residential electricity rates alone rose by 6% over the last three months.

And this isn’t a recent phenomenon. The National Center for Energy Analytics points out that, since the beginning of 2010, the average change in residential electric prices increased by 63%.

What’s driving these double-digit increases? Customers are now experiencing the full impact of decades of divestment from reliable energy generation in favor of intermittent and costly substitutes. For decades, states have engaged in a green-tinted race to the bottom, competing over clean-energy credentials. States have increasingly imposed mandates for renewable energy and insisted that intermittent power from the sun and the wind was the most affordable option.

But in practice, this transition gave us higher rates and a fragile grid. Over the last five years, an alarming number of grid crises have rocked communities nationwide. Major events included the California heat wave in 2020, Winter Storm Uri in Texas in 2021, and Winter Storm Elliot in the mid-Atlantic in 2022. Elliot, though mild compared to other storms, revealed weak points in Pennsylvania’s grid.

Faced with no heat in the depths of winter or air conditioning in the height of summer, it didn’t take long for the consensus on clean and green to shift to reliable and affordable.

But rather than present a realistic correction, several elected leaders opted to scapegoat. Last December, five governors sued PJM Interconnection, claiming the grid operator failed to take steps to bring down prices. However, the prices these governors railed against were the predictable result of supply shortages stemming from their misguided policies, such as enforcing costly climate-related mandates and prematurely closing fossil fuel power plants.

Even blue-state governors have reversed course on the “clean is king” myth. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul approved a new gas pipeline through her state “to ensure grid reliability and affordability.” Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker has touted lower costs as a major goal of the latest energy reform bill that ends the state’s moratorium on new nuclear generation. Energy affordability was the leading kitchen-table issue for the recent gubernatorial elections in Virginia and New Jersey — though the governors-elect’s policies are suspect.

Clean and green is no longer the consensus as residents begin to question when the rising rates will end.

In Pennsylvania, the pivot away from carbon taxes to spur clean energy was clear when the recent state budget eliminated the years-long effort to enter the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), the multistate compact that caps emissions from power producers and sells “allowances” to them.

But the cap-and-trade scheme proved to be politically untenable. Economic forecasts showed that RGGI would increase electricity bills by 30%. Also, even with RGGI, forecasts showed increased carbon emissions across the PJM grid. Despite his best efforts to keep RGGI alive, Gov. Josh Shapiro relented, agreeing to withdraw his appeal to a lower court’s ruling that rightly stated RGGI was an unconstitutional tax—a noteworthy first for any state considering such a compact.

Clean is no longer top of mind, but affordability is. Poll after poll reveals a growing concern among voters about their ability to afford their utility bills.

Fortunately, Pennsylvania can show the way. In fact, the Keystone State pulled off the unimaginable: It cut emissions while also increasing electricity generation. Pennsylvania’s Independent Fiscal Office found that, from 2019 to 2024, the commonwealth removed seven million metric tons of carbon emissions — roughly the same amount cut by its RGGI neighbor to the east, New Jersey. However, during the same period, New Jersey’s electricity generation decreased by 13% while Pennsylvania’s increased by 5%.

With numbers like that, who needs RGGI?

Pennsylvania demonstrates that “affordability” and “clean” aren’t mutually exclusive terms. It is possible to have the best of both worlds.

And that’s what legislation like the Affordable, Reliable, and Clean Energy Security Act accomplishes: It reflects the voters’ desire to balance cost with reliability and environmental stewardship. Lucky for us, that’s precisely what markets can do.

Central to this shift is the rise of the net-zero factory, a facility designed to operate with zero net greenhouse gas emissions, often powered by renewable energy, optimized for efficiency, and built for sustainability. While fully verified net-zero factories remain rare, a growing number of US-based manufacturers are designing or retrofitting plants to meet these ambitious environmental goals.

From high-tech gigafactories to smart retrofits of legacy plants, US industry is beginning to align production with sustainability. This movement is not only about compliance or public relations, it’s increasingly about competitiveness, operational efficiency, and long-term value. Below are eight standout factories and plants across the United States that are leading the charge in net-zero manufacturing and redefining what sustainable industry looks like in practice.

1. Schneider Electric

The Lexington plant of Schneider Electric in Kentucky has been recognized as a “Sustainability Lighthouse” by the World Economic Forum. This facility uses Internet of Things technology, advanced energy management systems, and predictive analytics to drastically cut energy usage and emissions.

The plant has achieved a 26 percent reduction in energy use, a 30 percent drop in CO₂ emissions, and a 20 percent decrease in water consumption. These metrics align closely with net-zero goals and demonstrate how digitalization can drive sustainable manufacturing practices.

The Lexington factory sets a benchmark for older plants aiming to become net-zero without needing to rebuild from scratch. Its performance shows how retrofitted facilities can lead the way in reducing industrial emissions.

2. Tesla

Tesla’s Gigafactory in Storey County, Nevada, is a high-profile example of a facility designed with sustainability in mind. It produces lithium-ion battery packs and electric drivetrains and is part of Tesla’s broader clean energy ecosystem.

Originally intended to be powered entirely by renewable energy, the factory is surrounded by large-scale solar arrays and is transitioning toward full energy independence. Its modular design allows for continued expansion while maintaining a focus on sustainable operations.

Gigafactory Nevada represents a major step toward creating self-sufficient, low-emission production at scale, one of the defining traits of a modern net-zero factory.

3. Toyota Motor North America

Toyota has committed to reaching carbon neutrality across its operations by 2035. This includes its US-based manufacturing sites, such as Toyota Motor Manufacturing Kentucky and its new battery plant in North Carolina.

These facilities are being retooled to transition to 100 percent renewable electricity. Toyota is also integrating electrified equipment, renewable natural gas, and hydrogen fuel cells into its operations.

As part of its environmental strategy, Toyota is not only focused on reducing emissions but on designing a more circular and resource-efficient manufacturing process. These efforts position its US factories as future net-zero leaders in automotive manufacturing.

4. The US Battery Belt

The rise of the US Battery Belt, a string of lithium-ion battery factories across the South and Midwest, is reshaping the industrial landscape. Over 30 such plants are now in various stages of construction or operation.

Many of these facilities are being designed to use clean energy, with companies like SK On, Panasonic, and Ford committing to sourcing renewable power for their operations. For example, Ford’s BlueOval City in Tennessee will include a massive battery facility developed with SK On and is planned to operate with minimal emissions.

This regional boom in clean battery manufacturing reflects the broader shift toward net-zero manufacturing across the US clean tech sector.

5. Scalable sustainability

Beyond large-scale brand names, many small and medium US manufacturers are adopting lean manufacturing principles that align closely with net-zero goals. These practices include waste reduction, resource optimization, and energy efficiency.

Facilities that follow these strategies, sometimes referred to as “lean and green,” may not advertise themselves as net-zero factories, but they are actively reducing emissions through operational excellence.

6. Broad industry momentum

Nearly 45 percent of US manufacturers have set formal sustainability or net-zero goals, according to recent reports. These facilities span industries such as consumer goods, automotive, aerospace, and industrial components.

While many are in the early stages of transition, their public commitments to reach net-zero by 2030 or 2040 reflect a growing industry consensus. Facilities are upgrading their systems, installing renewables, and embedding emissions tracking to stay on course.

This growing wave of corporate commitments is transforming net-zero from a niche ambition into a mainstream operational standard.

7. New-build factories designed for net-zero

Newly constructed manufacturing sites have a unique advantage, the ability to design for sustainability from day one. Across the US, companies are building plants that integrate renewable energy, smart systems, and high-efficiency infrastructure right from the blueprint phase.

Examples include renewable-powered data centers, hydrogen-ready cement plants, and vertically integrated solar panel production lines. These factories are not retrofitted for sustainability, they are born into it.

Such facilities are essential models for future industrial development as net-zero standards become embedded in planning, permitting, and financing processes.

8. Sector-wide decarbonization

Beyond individual plants, industry-wide efforts are accelerating sustainable manufacturing across the US. Initiatives like the Department of Energy’s Industrial Decarbonization Roadmap and private-public partnerships are enabling cleaner production across multiple sectors.

Large-scale programs are supporting factory electrification, carbon capture, material innovation, and circular production. As these programs scale up, more factories will be supported in making the leap toward net-zero.

Collectively, these sector-wide initiatives ensure that sustainability is not limited to flagship projects but becomes embedded in the DNA of US manufacturing.

What these factories signal for the future

Net-zero manufacturing is quickly moving from aspiration to action in the United States. While only a few factories can currently claim to be fully net-zero, the eight sites featured here reflect a powerful shift across industries, from automotive to electronics and beyond.

They show that achieving net-zero emissions is possible through smart design, renewable energy integration, digital technology, and policy alignment. As more companies invest in decarbonization and as regulatory and market pressures intensify, these early adopters offer a roadmap for how the broader manufacturing base can transition.

The path to a sustainable industrial future will not be uniform or easy, but with continued innovation, collaboration, and investment, net-zero factories may soon become the norm rather than the exception.",https://manufacturing-today.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/11/net-zero-manufacturingNL25.jpeg,N,,2025-11-28 15:00:05.102743

Two Gulf Coast megaprojects have already broken ground in 2025, signaling a surge in demand for liquid natural gas (LNG) construction.

Total North American LNG export capacity is forecasted to more than double by 2028.

Global LNG demand is projected to rise 40% from 2024 to 2030, but oversupply is possible by the end of the decade.

The Gulf Coast region is experiencing a surge in construction driven by the development of liquefied natural gas (LNG) infrastructure. Including, for example, two Texas megaprojects (construction projects worth $1 billion and up) that broke ground this year across the region.

The first megaproject is a $2 billion, 400-mile LNG pipeline aimed at expanding export access while also supporting the state’s growing power plant and data center demands. The second is Sempra’s $14 billion expansion of the Port Arthur LNG production facility.

This investment wave is a response to projected global LNG demand growth of nearly 40% from 2024 to 2030, according to BloombergNEF.

Multiple additional projects worth billions more are targeting construction start dates before the end of 2026, creating potential opportunities for Gulf Coast construction firms.

Drivers Behind the LNG Expansion

US production of natural gas doubled over the period from 2004 to 2024 as it became an increasingly important energy source on the global market. LNG serves as a cleaner alternative to coal and a reliable backup for renewable energy sources.

This graph shows the total yearly dry production of natural gas in the United States from 2004 to 2024, in Millions of Cubic Feet. Image: ConstructConnect

The growth in demand for natural gas on the global stage is largely driven by Asia, with economies like China, India, and Thailand experiencing rapid growth, according to BloombergNEF. Europe also contributes to demand as nations reduce dependence on Russian gas supplies.

Domestically, natural gas is being used to provide power to Data Centers, which have eclipsed $30 billion in construction starts value so far this year, according to the ConstructConnect Data Center Report.

An example of this usage can be seen in Meta’s data center operations in Louisiana, where energy provider Entergy plans to build natural gas power plants to supply energy to the Meta facility.

Future of LNG

Near-term liquified natural gas production and transport investment has been substantial, providing potential opportunities for Gulf Coast-based construction firms.

According to the US Energy Information Administration, North American LNG export capacity is on pace to more than double by 2028. This includes several substantial projects that remain in development, including a multi-billion-dollar Entergy natural gas plant in Louisiana, according to ConstructConnect Project Intelligence.

However, the International Energy Agency estimates the global LNG market will be notably oversupplied by 2030. This suggests the project pipeline may thin some after the near-term buildout concludes.

Firms specializing in LNG work should closely monitor these trends and prepare strategies to diversify their project pipeline or pivot if investment volumes decline.

It was just about two weeks ago that 201 new EV chargers were announced for installation at Michigan apartment complexes. Another EV charger installation project in Michigan was just announced — over 40 fast chargers in Detroit.

The first site is in Canton, Michigan, at a property owned by the real estate developer Dabaja Brothers Development Group. “We started this project because we saw a gap in our community—there was almost nowhere to charge an EV in Canton, and a similar lack of charging across metro Detroit. Together with ChargePoint, we are bringing fast, reliable charging to the community, better enabling us to serve all of our customers,” said Yousef Dabaja, owner/operator at Dabaja Brothers Development Group.

The Detroit area has some charging deserts, and Canton is one of them, hence the new fast charger installation there. Lavonia and Dearborn are two of the other planned sites that will use ChargePoint fast charging stations.

“In total, Dabaja intends to deploy more than 40 ports with more planned across its locations, enabling EV drivers to charge quickly and easily while they shop, dine, or visit local attractions. Each site will feature ChargePoint Express Plus fast charging stations. All stations will be managed by the new ChargePoint Platform, ChargePoint’s next-generation, flexible software solution designed provide real-time insights, monitor performance, adjust pricing, and respond to customer needs.”

While some people don’t think the installation of dozens of new EV chargers is newsworthy, these projects do matter to the people who live locally and travel to and through the areas where the new chargers will be. This fact is true especially in charging deserts. Going from no chargers to even just several means the distance EV drivers must travel to find a charge is decreased significantly, so they have less risk of “range anxiety” and are capable of conveniently driving to more places.

The company delivered record volumes across its CNG Fuels station network, sharply higher earnings and an upgraded full-year outlook, while confirming it is considering an uplisting or dual listing in 2026.

Dispensed biomethane volumes rose 15 per cent year on year, driven by increased adoption from fleet operators and the first introduction of 6×2 CNG trucks into UK operations.

CNG Fuels generated EBITDA of GBP 2.9 million for the quarter, up 190 per cent on the same period last year, reflecting both stronger utilisation and continuing demand growth as operators shift away from diesel.

ReFuels has raised its full-year FY2026 EBITDA expectation to between GBP 10 million and GBP 12 million, up from the previous range of GBP 8 million to GBP 10 million.

While saving money for fossil fuel companies, the delay on the rule could lead to 3.8 million more tons of methane entering the atmosphere, according to the Trump administration’s own estimates.
“After years of scientific work and public engagement, this administration’s decision to delay methane pollution standards implementation yet again is a blatant act of climate denial and disregard for public health.
The EPA’s job is to protect people, not pad the pockets of oil and gas executives,” said Pagel.
“Children in my community and across the nation need a strong and comprehensive oil and gas methane rule as soon as possible,” said Patrice Tomcik, senior national field director for Moms Clean Air Force.","With methane more than 28 times as potent as carbon at trapping heat in the atmosphere in a 100-year period, climate experts agree that reducing methane leaks from oil and gas fields would be one of the fastest and most effective ways of making a measurable impact on planetary heating—but President Donald Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday flatly refused to do so, instead announcing a delay on a requirement for fossil fuel companies to limit methane emissions.

The Biden administration had introduced the requirement for oil and gas firms to begin reducing their emissions this year, but the EPA said companies will now have until January 2027 to comply with the rule. The administration is also considering repealing the requirement entirely.

Lauren Pagel, policy director for Earthworks, called the delay “indefensible and illegal.”

“The Trump administration has once again chosen polluters over people, sacrificing the health of communities and climate to serve the fossil fuel industry,” said Pagel. “Every day national methane rules are delayed means more methane in the air, more toxic pollution in our lungs, and more irreversible climate damage.”

The EPA claimed it was providing companies with a “more realistic timeline” for complying with the requirement, and said the action would “save an estimated $750 million over 11 years in compliance costs.”

Methane can leak from oil and gas wells, pipelines, and other fossil fuel infrastructure, and companies often intentionally release methane through flaring. The fossil fuel industry is the largest industrial source of methane emissions in the US, where emissions of methane have risen sharply in recent years as the Biden administration oversaw record production of oil and gas, even as it sought to reduce emissions through the methane requirement and other regulations.

While saving money for fossil fuel companies, the delay on the rule could lead to 3.8 million more tons of methane entering the atmosphere, according to the Trump administration’s own estimates.

“After years of scientific work and public engagement, this administration’s decision to delay methane pollution standards implementation yet again is a blatant act of climate denial and disregard for public health. The EPA’s job is to protect people, not pad the pockets of oil and gas executives,” said Pagel.

In addition to contributing to global heating and the extreme flooding, hurricanes, heatwaves, and other destructive weather events that come with it, methane emissions are linked to higher ground-level ozone pollution made up of tiny particles that can cause respiratory and cardiac problems, cancer, and strokes.

Grace Smith, senior attorney at the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), noted that the methane standards have already been working “to reduce pollution, protect people’s health, and prevent the needless waste of American energy”—progress that will now be reversed by EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and Trump.

“The rule released today means millions of Americans will be exposed to dangerous pollution for another year and a half, for no good reason,” said Smith. “Delaying the methane standards threatens people’s health and undermines progress by industry leaders.”

“What’s more, the Trump administration rushed to push through this harmful rule without meaningful transparency or a chance for the public to weigh in,” added Smith. “EDF is already in court challenging EPA’s first attempt to delay these vital protections. We will continue to oppose the rule released today, so that people can breathe cleaner air.”

EDF and the grassroots group Moms Clean Air Force expressed particular concern over nearly 18 million people in the US who live near active oil and gas wells.

“Children in my community and across the nation need a strong and comprehensive oil and gas methane rule as soon as possible,” said Patrice Tomcik, senior national field director for Moms Clean Air Force.

EDF noted that “proven, cost-effective solutions are available to help oil and gas operators meet the standards while reducing waste and monetary losses,” and both large and small producers have expressed support for the federal methane regulation as fossil fuel-producing states have begun implementing the standards.

The rule announced Wednesday, said EDF, “ignores the strong opposition to the rule from members of impacted communities and wide variety of other Americans.”",https://www.rawstory.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=62254800&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C166%2C0%2C167,N,,2025-11-28 12:00:50.598974

The letter’s authors complain that lawmakers are attempting to “make sure that the public actually knows who’s green and who isn’t.”

California’s new laws, set to go into effect January 1, 2026, will require larger companies operating in the state to publicly state their “climate-related financial risk,” as well as issue emissions records and public assessments of their environmental impacts.

This follows a growing legal trend that sees businesses fight transparency rules by citing the Constitution’s “compelled speech” protections. Corporations claim that the First Amendment shields them from being forced to speak out on issues and have used the principle to fight emissions disclosures, drug price caps, social media reforms, and a suite of other consumer and public health protections.

Businesses say transparency rules, like California’s, illegally force them into speaking out on what they consider politically controversial topics, essentially arguing that the disclosure rules put words in their mouth.

Experts are warning that if the courts agree with these firms, the effects could be devastating to wide-ranging regulatory efforts.

“Anything can be political and controversial because science doesn’t deal in absolute certainty,” James Wheaton, founder of the public interest law firm the First Amendment Project, told the Lever’s Katherine Li last year.

""Only electric vehicles zero out tailpipe emissions.","After initially excluding them, the state now includes electric trucks in Florida's plans for about $48 million specifically meant for projects to reduce harmful emissions. Public feedback prompted the Florida Department of Environmental Protection to revise its initial plans for how to spend the money.

RELATED: Millions of dollars for ""cleaner technology"" shouldn't go to electric vehicles, says Florida proposal

The $48 million is from the state's share of so-called Volkswagen funds, paid by the car company into a mitigation trust fund after allegedly violating the Clean Air Act by selling ""trick"" vehicles designed to cheat federal emissions tests. States received payouts from the mitigation fund based on how many ""trick"" vehicles were registered in each state, according to the EPA.

Florida's total share was $166 million. So far, most of it has gone to electric bus projects. With the state's remaining roughly $48 million, FDEP wants to help public and private fleet operators upgrade to lower-emission freight trucks.

But up until recently, FDEP's plans didn't include electric trucks in the list of lower-emission options eligible for the funds. Now, after FDEP received public feedback on the plans, electric trucks are on the list.

Stan Cross is director of electric transportation for the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, one of several electrification stakeholder groups that urged FDEP to revise its plans. He said he's happy to see EV eligibility preserved.

""Electric transportation stakeholders were clear in our comments: not including electric vehicles as eligible for Volkswagen settlement funding amounted to government meddling in the free market,"" Cross said. ""Now that EVs are eligible, public and private fleet operators can choose the alternative fuel technology that best suits their needs.""

Along with electric trucks, FDEP's plans also list trucks powered by ""new diesel,"" compressed natural gas and propane as eligible, lower-emission upgrade options for fleets. Cross said EVs are the best option.

""Only electric vehicles zero out tailpipe emissions. All the other alternative fuels still pollute,"" Cross said. ""EVs are also the most affordable vehicles in the long term, because electricity is the cheapest transportation fuel and EVs have the lowest maintenance costs.

""So an EV might be the best tool for the job, and having EVs eligible for the funding empowers fleet operators to make that decision.""

Fleet operators of vehicles used in community service, disaster management and emergency response functions will get funding priority, according to FDEP.

RELATED: Florida makes millions available for lower-emission garbage trucks

To date, nearly 70% of Florida's Volkswagen funds have gone to electric school bus and transit bus projects, and just under 8% to electric vehicle charging infrastructure (EVCI) projects. Neither category will be funded with the state's remaining $48 million, according to FDEP's finalized plans.

Some of the public comments submitted to FDEP urged the state to continue to use Volkswagen funds to support electric bus and EV-charging projects. But FDEP ""determined that it is in the interest of the state, the public, and the intended beneficiaries of the Volkswagen Settlement"" not to do so.

Projects previously funded in both categories — electric buses and EV charging infrastructure — proved to be more lengthy and expensive than initially anticipated, according to FDEP. There were ""long lead times needed to purchase eligible electric buses that meet fleet operators' needs."" And for EV charging sites, some projects weren't finished until more than three years after the date of the grant award to complete.

As of October, there are more than 4,000 EV-charging stations in Florida, including 42 EVCI projects funded by money from the Volkswagen settlement.

""We would have liked to see funding still made available for charging infrastructure, but are happy to see that electric vehicle eligibility is preserved,"" Cross said. ""Getting vehicles on the road that are driving on affordable and clean electricity is important and should be a top priority for the state.""

Compared to other states in the Southeast, Florida ranks first for EV sales, according to SACE's latest annual report.

In August, FDEP's draft plans estimated the state had nearly $41 million of Volkswagen funds left to spend. Between the state's remaining project funds and interest accrued on those funds, Florida's actual remaining balance is more than $48 million, according to the state's new, finalized plans.

Florida has been slower than many other states to spend its Volkswagen dollars, according to energy industry members. The state plans to wrap up the fund by 2027.

Oil slumps amid supply glut fears and shifting Ukraine diplomacy Oil is on track for its fourth straight monthly decline, the longest slide since 2023, with Brent steady above USD63/b and WTI near USD59/b as traders focus on this weekend’s OPEC+ meeting and potential progress toward ending the Ukraine war. OPEC+ is expected to maintain its pause on output increases for early 2026, while long-term capacity reviews take centre stage. Prices have fallen 15% this year on expectations of a widening surplus driven by renewed OPEC+ capacity and rising non-OPEC supply, with the IEA projecting supply to rise by 2.5mb/d creating a market surplus of roughly 4mb/d given weak demand growth. Diplomatic signals from Russia and the US raise the prospect of easing sanctions, which could unleash additional Russian barrels, even as current curbs strain producers, evident in crude stockpiles at Russian fields climbing above 16 million barrels, one of the highest levels since the war began.

Gold extends rally on rising Fed cut expectations. Gold is heading for its fourth consecutive monthly gain, trading around USD4,190/oz and up nearly 5% on the week, as expectations intensify for another US interest rate cut in December, with markets pricing 25bps move. A wave of dovish signals from Fed officials and delays in key US economic data, caused by a record government shutdown, have strengthened the case for lower borrowing costs, which boost non-yielding assets like gold. Gold has risen almost every month this year and is on track for its best annual performance since 1979, supported by strong central bank purchases and robust inflows into ETFs, even after pulling back from its record above USD4,380/oz. Going forward, investors will focus on the Fed’s December decision, the pace of US data normalisation, and whether sustained safe-haven flows can keep gold anchored above the USD4,000 level.

MIDDLE EAST - MACRO / MARKETS

Egypt posts strongest growth in over two years. Egypt’s economy expanded by 5.3% in the first quarter of FY2025-26, its fastest pace in more than two years and the first time growth has topped 5% in over three years, driven by structural reforms that are shifting activity toward tradable, high-productivity sectors such as manufacturing, tourism, and telecommunications. Private investment surged 25.9%, reaching 66% of total investment as the government continued reducing its share to prioritise high-impact projects and empower the private sector. Strong non-oil manufacturing growth was propelled by robust demand, tourism jumped 13.8% while Suez Canal revenue returned to positive growth (8.6%) after 18 months of declines, and the ICT and financial sectors expanded by 14.5% and 10.2%, respectively. Although the extractive sector contracted due to weaker petroleum and gas output, the pace of decline eased amid 75 new discoveries and 383 new wells, boosting production capacity. The Planning Ministry said momentum remains strong, projecting at least 5% growth for the full fiscal year, with a more stable regional backdrop offering further upside.

Gulf states expand influence in Africa through strategic investments. Gulf sovereign wealth funds are rapidly deepening their presence in Africa as part of a broader strategy to extend influence beyond oil and secure critical resources for the global clean energy transition, exemplified by Qatar Investment Authority’s USD500 million investment in Ivanhoe Mines to access copper and other key minerals. Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE are channelling capital into African renewable energy, mineral extraction, and infrastructure projects to diversify their economies, ensure long-term energy security, and position themselves within global supply chains in increasingly shaped by AI-driven electricity demand. Africa’s vast solar potential and rich reserves of minerals make it a natural partner for Gulf economies, which have abundant capital but rely heavily on hydrocarbons. As the world moves toward a post-oil era, this growing “south-south” partnership positions the Gulf as a rising power shaping Africa’s energy future and potentially redefined global economic influence.",https://www.mufgresearch.com/media/w44euow5/shutterstock_2339356521.png,N,,2025-11-28 13:00:23.959282

More than a decade in SC DartPoints has operated data centers in South Carolina for more than a decade.
In all, DartPoints has about 300 customers that use its four South Carolina data centers, Willis told legislators last September.
The company does not publicize how many people it employs in South Carolina but pledged 10 new jobs as part of the expansion.
After Greenville, Willis said, DartPoints will turn its attention to growing its Columbia center, located within the South Carolina Research Authority Innovation Center.","Data center operator DartPoints plans to up the capacity of its Greenville center by 400%.

But unlike the super centers popping up around the Palmetto State, each gobbling upwards of 100 megawatts of power, DartPoints’ growth is on a much smaller scale — 12.5 megawatts, up from a 2.5-megawatt starting point.

The company pledged this month to invest $125 million in the expansion of its Greenville location, adding 88,000 square feet to the facility.

At the heart of the company’s expansion: artificial intelligence.

DartPoints’ customers are now demanding three times the capacity and computing power compared to just a year or so ago, CEO Scott Willis told the SC Daily Gazette.

“AI potentially has the opportunity to change their business in a very dramatic way. We’ve got to come along with that,” he said.

Companies are turning to AI bots to run customer care chats. Robots in manufacturing are becoming more autonomous. And from a health care perspective, hospital systems are offering more computer-heavy remote services, with wearable devices that track vitals like heart rate and blood sugar, Willis said.

So expanding is essential, he said, if DartPoints wants its centers to remain relevant over the next five years.

“It is no longer a ‘nice to have.’ It’s a requirement, on our part, to understand that change, anticipate that change,” Willis said.

More than a decade in SC

DartPoints has operated data centers in South Carolina for more than a decade. With locations in Columbia, Spartanburg and Charleston, as well as Greenville, the state is the Dallas-headquartered company’s largest market.

To finance its expansion in South Carolina, as well as in Ohio and Indiana, DartPoints secured a $250 million investment from a pair of partners earlier this year.

“South Carolina is a great business environment,” Willis said. “It’s a great state, positioned within the Southeast. It’s growing massively in terms of attracting businesses, and we want to participate in that.”

But consumer groups and politicians have pushed back against the proliferation of data centers over the past couple years. Most of that ire is aimed at so-called hyperscale centers, owned and operated by tech giants such as Google and Meta.

Meta invests in SC solar as utilities expect more clean energy-conscious firms to finance projects

These windowless centers, which house rows of servers, are among the largest drivers of growing power needs in the state, generating vast demand for electricity on top of the needs of an ever-growing manufacturing and population base.

Willis is quick to point out not all data centers are the same.

For starters, he said, utilities already have the kind of capacity on their system that DartPoints requires.

“We are a non-invasive partner inside the state,” Willis said. “We don’t disrupt the demand of the grid. We’re not asking Duke (Energy) or other utilities to invest a significant amount of money that could result in price increases for the overall citizens of the state of South Carolina.”

A different kind of customer

DartPoints also tends to serve customers that require a bit more privacy and control over their IT systems.

The company specializes in private, dedicated servers that its customers can access remotely, with guarantees that the computing power will always be available for that customer’s use. Turning to Google or Microsoft or Amazon Web Services, businesses share space on those companies’ servers, using what’s known as a public cloud system, Willis said.

If a DartPoints customer wants even more control, they can choose to have their own servers caged within a DartPoints facility that only that company’s employees have access to. DartPoints simply supplies the space and power it takes to operate and cool the equipment.

Before DartPoints moved into the state, Willis said, companies had to turn to major providers in big cities, such as Atlanta, Charlotte or Nashville or major computing hubs in northern Virginia, for these serices.

Now, companies have a local option that often comes at a lower cost because they don’t have to lay down lines of fiber to get connected to a distant center. The computing speeds are also faster because companies don’t have to wait for their data to travel longer distances over the network, a major bonus as more are turning to artificial intelligence.

In all, DartPoints has about 300 customers that use its four South Carolina data centers, Willis told legislators last September. Those companies collectively generate $60 billion in revenue within the state and employ about 140,000 people.

DartPoints’ customer base mirrors the state’s major economic sectors — manufacturing, health care, some financial institutions and state and local government, as well as higher education.

“DartPoints’ growth in Greenville shows how innovation and infrastructure investment go hand in hand,” Gov. Henry McMaster said in a statement. “This project reinforces South Carolina’s position as a destination for technology-driven business and demonstrates how our state can support advanced digital operations with the power, talent and collaboration they require to thrive.”

Construction is underway and the additional space is expected to be operational in July 2027.

The company does not publicize how many people it employs in South Carolina but pledged 10 new jobs as part of the expansion.

After Greenville, Willis said, DartPoints will turn its attention to growing its Columbia center, located within the South Carolina Research Authority Innovation Center. Details on that expansion are forthcoming, he said.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47658/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/gettyimages-2115899404-scaled-1-1024x6831764335177.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=qA22Wpfw,N,,2025-11-28 10:04:51.208524

A little more than three years after the City began its in-house Richmond Compost Initiative in August of 2022, the city has signed on to a regional composting initiative alongside Chesterfield and Henrico counties facilitated by CVWMA, the public service authority established in 1990 which facilitates the city’s curbside and drop-off recycling. The new composting program includes an expanded array of items acceptable for composting. Up until this point, Richmonders could only divert food and vegetable scraps from landfills via the city composting initiative.

The importance of composting

About a third of food in the U.S. is wasted. As this food degrades, it releases methane, a greenhouse gas which is “more than 28 times as potent as carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere.” according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

One of the ways to reduce methane emissions is to compost food scraps instead of throwing them away.

Composting is a controlled process where microorganisms break down sources of nitrogen (‘greens’, i.e. food waste) which are combined with sources of carbon (‘browns’, i.e. yard waste).

The process results in a nutrient-rich, soil-like humus that can be used as fertilizer in gardens or as part of soil amendment.

In addition to providing nutrients, compost increases the capacity of soils to hold on to water, decreasing runoff into waterways.

Humble origins

In 2020, Kate Rivara was working as the City of Richmond’s Community Garden Coordinator with the city’s Department of Parks, Recreation and Community Facilities (PRCF). As she observed composting efforts in the gardens she oversaw, she identified it as an area for improvement — the few gardens that were trying to mix compost weren't getting a product suitable for use in garden beds or other plantings.

Rivara reached out to Mark Davis, owner of Real Roots Food Systems, to help her create a concept for a city-run composting program. They applied for a grant from the USDA in 2020 to start the program which was denied.

Not to be deterred, Rivara remixed the grant application the following year. She reached out to Katrina Entzminger and Torrence Robinson with the City’s Department of Public Works to brainstorm a partnership with PRCF to run the program.

The resulting concept added in-kind donations from DPW in the form of a site to produce the compost at Wickham Court, a skid steer to mix the compost, work hours of DPW employees and the service of a DPW truck to pick up the green and purple compost carts from 22 sites each week (the colors of the compost carts were chosen by Rivara).

PRCF employees and City Workforce Development employees rounded out the labor needed to produce the compost on-site, and Davis was contracted to contribute his knowledge of the production process and help fine-tune the program.

The program was tweaked over time, its final form relied on windrows — long rows where composting inputs (browns and greens) were mixed, tarped, and left to cook (as microorganisms break down the input matter, heat is created). Finally, the compost was then sifted to create a fine product.

By the numbers, the city embraced the program: Residents contributed 219,431 pounds of organic matter to the purple and green carts in 2023, and 278,243 pounds in 2024 (these measurements were calculated by volume, so the weight conversion isn’t perfect). The finished compost was delivered to community gardens and other sites that hosted compost drop-offs, and was also used in city plantings. From June 2023 to May 2024, 176 cubic yards of finished compost was produced and delivered.

Running out of money

Having exhausted the USDA grant in April 2022, the city composting program was running on a shoestring budget, and the in-kind labor from PRCF and DPW were hitting a ceiling amidst a growing program. With no new funding to keep up with the increasing amount of contributed food scraps, from grants or otherwise, a shift was needed.

An expanded citywide composting program is called for in RVAgreen 2050, the climate action and climate resilience plan that lays out a roadmap for Richmond to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 45% by 2030 and achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

RVAgreen 2050 lays out a future where compost is accepted at all city-owned buildings, parks, facilities, commercial buildings and events, and includes a curbside pickup, prioritizing frontline communities. To get to this point, the city needs to scale up the volume of food scraps it is collecting and see increased buy-in to make those goals attainable.

“I think once we get a more balanced participation, like we're reaching anybody and everybody that could possibly have an interest in food waste, then I think we could look at more saturation within the community and and maybe even curbside,” said Katrina Entzminger, Senior Management Analyst with the Department of Public Works.

Recycling group adds composting services

In the fall of 2024, CVWMA began facilitating compost pickups from two sites in Henrico County, which started as a way for residents to compost their halloween pumpkins.

The program is facilitated by a contract with NOPE Compost Co., a local company founded in 2009 which specializes in the proper handling and logistics of compostables. Coincidentally, NOPE Compost ran a composting program at the 2015 UCI World Road Cycling Champsionships in Richmond.

These facilities occupy a much larger footprint than the city initiative, have more sophisticated technology, and meet regulatory requirements that allow them to take “kind of a broader level of items, like meat and bones … other things that we can accept would be like the PLA or the biopolymer, bioplastic cups and serveware,” according to Marshall Hall, owner of Nope Compost Co.

According to McGill, their annual compost processing capacity “is 10 times that of a windrow operation with the same footprint.”

Envisioning a regional initiative which serves additional localities in its portfolio, CVWMA approached the City about joining the program. With the city-run initiative reaching its financial and personnel limits, signing on to the program was a logical next step, and puts the food waste aspect of waste management back under the umbrella of DPW.

“We've been kind of cheerleaders for what the city was doing with their program for years, since it started. And we really, really applaud the work to reduce the amount of food waste that was going to the landfills and put it to a good use in the community gardens. So I think that given our history with the City of Richmond on solid waste planning on the curbside and the drop off recycling program, it kind of made sense that we could maybe help take the program to another level.” — Julie Buchanan, Public Relations Coordinator with CVWMA.

This sentiment was echoed by Katrina Entzminger.

“I'm super excited about the expansion, because now there are so many more items that can be added in that people you know, will put into the bins,"" she said. ""From a DPW standpoint, from an operations standpoint, you know, it's just more stuff that is being diverted from the landfill.”

In addition to the increased assortment of compostable food items, the regional program diverges from the city initiative in a few other ways. The number of drop-off sites has decreased to 18 to streamline the pickups for NOPE Compost. The original 35 gallon purple and green compost carts have been replaced with 65 gallon carts in the same colors (the color scheme is also being used in Henrico and Chesterfield counties).

One downside to the new arrangement is that instead of all of the compost produced from residents’ contributions being returned to community gardens and other local destinations, the city will now only receive one cubic foot bag of finished compost for every ton collected.

The city composting program is still making compost in its existing windrows, which should last PRCF for their needs through spring of 2026. Though the transition to the regional initiative is a logical step, the end of the city-run initiative is bittersweet to Rivara.

“It was like Christmas, a very gross Christmas every week, right? Some of the contamination was surprising. And sometimes, you know, organic matter might have included somebody's diary that was pretty juicy. So it was really interesting week after week,"" she said.

In its latest announcement earlier this month (17 November), Wärtsilä’s 5MWh BESS solution, Quantum 3, was revealed to have undergone UL9540A unit-level testing, LSFT, testing of the technology provider’s proprietary Active Ignition Mitigation System (AIMS).
Wärtsilä said that in UL9540A thermal runaway propagation testing, Quantum 3 demonstrated that in the event of thermal runaway in a battery cell, fire would not spread to adjacent battery modules or BESS enclosures.
Cells and modules in the initiating cabinet were sent into thermal runaway and ignited using a propane burner.
No cell venting or thermal runaway or fire occurred in the target cabinet, where internal temperature stayed below the venting threshold, CPS claimed.","UL Solutions conducted the testing on Sungrow’s SBH Series: Residential ESS, subjecting a unit to forced battery cell thermal runaway and assessing the outcome. During testing, fire suppression systems are deactivated to simulate worst-case scenarios in real-world conditions.

These scenarios include the potential buildup of flammable gases and external ignition. The tests evaluate how effectively a system’s design and materials prevent the spread of fire, explosions and other secondary risks.

Sungrow said the modular, stackable SBH Series unit, available in 10kWh increments, contained fire spread, with internal surface temperatures of adjacent units recorded at 21°C, which is below the 154°C venting threshold. Open flames self-extinguished an hour after ignition without fire suppression intervening and with no re-ignition.

There were no combustion, explosion or projectile hazard events and the cabinet set on fire remained intact.

UL9540B is a new standard developed by the certification and standards agency UL. It is specifically aimed at residential energy storage systems of 20kWh capacity or less. It comprises two tests at cell level and for fire propagation, unlike the more established UL950A thermal runaway propagation test for larger systems that includes cell, module and unit-level tests.

“The output of UL 9540B is a single test report that evaluates the fire propagation of an electrochemical ESS and its thermal impact to the surrounding exposures,” according to a UL FAQ page on the test procedure.

UL said that the new residential tests were created as manufacturers relying on UL9540A test reports were informed of the need for LSFT data from authorities having jurisdiction (AHJs). AHJs said that the UL950A test series alone does not fulfil the requirements of the 2022 California Fire Code, for example.

While UL9540A remains a critical safety standard, is referenced in the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) standard NFPA 855 for ESS safety and UL9540A cell test data can be used for UL9540B, UL plans for the new residential tests also to form a consensus-based standard like its older counterpart.

Wärtsilä ups ante on safety tests

Along with utility-scale market segment rival system integrators such as Fluence, Hithium, Canadian Solar, Trina Storage and many others, including Sungrow, Wärtsilä has been among the companies announcing LSFT and other fire test results over the past couple of years or so.

The energy storage and optimisation arm of Finnish marine and engine power plant tech company Wartsila has been particularly vocal in advocating for tests that push systems and components to their limits and mimic real fire situations as closely as possible.

This includes contributed articles and participation in interviews with Energy-Storage.news and ESN Premium on a range of related topics.

In its latest announcement earlier this month (17 November), Wärtsilä’s 5MWh BESS solution, Quantum 3, was revealed to have undergone UL9540A unit-level testing, LSFT, testing of the technology provider’s proprietary Active Ignition Mitigation System (AIMS).

Tests were carried out by the standards agency CSA Group, which has been behind the development of LSFT procedures that will be mandatory under the new 2026 edition of NFPA 855. CSA Group experts took part in a sponsored webinar with Energy-Storage.news in late 2024 to discuss LSFT, including requirements, methodology and purpose.

Wärtsilä said that in UL9540A thermal runaway propagation testing, Quantum 3 demonstrated that in the event of thermal runaway in a battery cell, fire would not spread to adjacent battery modules or BESS enclosures.

This meant Quantum 3 met all necessary performance requirements, the company said. However, it should be noted that from a standards perspective, UL9540A is not technically a pass/fail criteria test, but instead allows stakeholders to evaluate objective test data.

In Large-Scale Fire Testing, conducted in compliance with the CSA/ANSI C800:25 test procedure, a Quantum 3 unit burned for 22 hours with fire suppression equipment deactivated. The fire was contained within the initiated unit without propagation.

Meanwhile, testing provided validation for Wärtsilä’s proprietary AIMS, a feature that ignites flammable gases to prevent buildup in a thermal event’s early stages.

A couple of months ago, the company conducted testing on the AIMS within Quantum 2, an earlier iteration of Wärtsilä’s Gridsolv Quantum BESS product range. At the time, Wärtsilä Energy Storage president and Wärtsilä executive VP Tamara de Gruyter claimed it as a “first-of-its-kind” test for the industry with flammable gases intentionally released inside a BESS enclosure.

C&I system test from Chint Power Systems

Finally, a couple of days ago, China-headquartered solar PV solutions provider Chint Power Systems (CPS), posted to LinkedIn that LSFT was recently conducted on its commercial and industrial (C&I) energy storage system in Suzhou, China.

Testing was carried out in accordance with the CSA 800 procedure and the UL9540A draft that includes LSFT. Although CPS did not say whether a third-party standards agency was directly involved in the testing itself in the short post, fire marshal and fire protection engineer Todd LaBerge who took part featured in an accompanying video.

CPS arranged four cabinets with one initiating cabinet, two target cabinets on either side and a cabinet across an aisle, designed to simulate the configuration of a real-world installation. Cells and modules in the initiating cabinet were sent into thermal runaway and ignited using a propane burner.

After active ignition of battery equipment at 1:09pm local time, the fire reached peak intensity between 1:25pm and 2:20pm and was burned out and extinguished by 4:02pm.

No cell venting or thermal runaway or fire occurred in the target cabinet, where internal temperature stayed below the venting threshold, CPS claimed. There was “some slight exterior damage” to the adjacent cabinets, which CPS engineer Todd LaBerge said was “normal”.

CPS deputy general manager Allen Xiang said the C&I cabinet is installed close to personnel and property at customer sites, making the need for rigorous safety testing especially critical.",https://www.energy-storage.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Wartsila-Quantum-3-LSFT.png,N,,2025-11-28 11:02:10.504046

Restraints Raw Material Supply Constraints and Recycling Gaps Limit PV Battery Expansion A major restraining factor for the Photovoltaic (PV) Battery market is the dependence on critical raw materials and the slow development of large-scale recycling systems.","Report Overview

The Global Photovoltaic (PV) Battery Market size is expected to be worth around USD 22.6 Billion by 2034, from USD 7.6 Billion in 2024, growing at a CAGR of 11.5% during the forecast period from 2025 to 2034. In 2024, North America held a dominan market position, capturing more than a 38.9% share, holding USD 2.9 Billion revenue.

Photovoltaic (PV) batteries refer to energy-storage systems, mainly lithium-ion, that store electricity generated by solar PV panels and release it later to smooth output, shift energy to evening peaks, and provide backup power. They are deployed at residential rooftops, commercial and industrial sites, and large grid-scale solar farms. This segment sits at the heart of the broader solar-plus-storage value chain, linking PV module manufacturers, battery cell producers, power electronics suppliers, and project developers into integrated distributed and utility-scale solutions.

The industrial backdrop is expanding rapidly as PV deployment accelerates. REN21 reports that at least 407 GW of new solar PV capacity came online in 2023, taking global installed PV capacity to around 1.6 TW, a record increase driven by low module costs and supportive policies. In parallel, global battery storage capacity – much of it coupled to renewables – grew 120% in 2023 to reach 55.7 GW, with China alone jumping from 7.8 GW in 2022 to 27.1 GW in 2023, while the United States rose to 16.2 GW, underscoring how fast PV-battery infrastructure is scaling.

Cost deflation is a central industrial driver. IRENA estimates that total costs of fully installed battery storage projects fell by 93% between 2010 and 2024, from around USD 2,571/kWh to USD 192/kWh, transforming the economics of pairing batteries with PV. Separate IRENA analysis shows lithium-ion storage costs declining about 82% between 2013 and 2023, largely due to manufacturing scale-up and technology improvements, which makes PV-battery systems increasingly competitive with fossil-fuel peaker plants.

Policy support is another strong driving factor. In the United States, the Residential Clean Energy Credit allows households to claim 30% of the cost of qualified clean-energy property, including battery storage paired with solar, for systems installed from 2022 to 2032, significantly improving the payback of residential PV-battery systems. At the same time, global renewable expansion targets imply huge storage needs: the International Energy Agency estimates that around 1,300 GW of battery storage will be required worldwide by 2030 to support variable renewables such as solar and wind, highlighting the scale of the PV-battery opportunity.

By Battery Type Analysis

Lithium-Ion dominates PV battery market with 72.4% share due to its superior energy density and rapidly declining costs.

In 2024, Lithium-Ion held a dominant market position, capturing more than a 72.4% share of the Photovoltaic (PV) battery segment. This position was supported by technology characteristics that made Lithium-Ion the preferred choice across residential, commercial and utility-scale PV applications: high energy density enabled compact installations, favourable cycle life reduced levelized cost of storage, and established manufacturing scale delivered consistent price declines. The industrial scene was characterized by widespread deployment of Lithium-Ion systems for short- to multi-hour storage tasks, where dispatchability and efficiency were required to firm variable solar output.

Procurement and project planning were driven by predictable performance metrics and mature supply chains for cells and pack integration, while system designers and financiers favoured standardised Lithium-Ion specifications to simplify warranty and insurance arrangements. In year-on-year terms, 2024 marked the consolidation of market share around Lithium-Ion, and into 2025 the technology continued to be the principal choice for new PV+storage installations. Policy measures and tariff structures that rewarded time-shifted solar generation were instrumental in reinforcing uptake, and attention was increasingly directed toward lifecycle management, recycling and second-life applications to address end-of-life risks.

By Chemistry Analysis

Lithium Cobalt Oxide leads PV battery chemistry with 56.9% thanks to its high energy density and widespread use.

In 2024, Lithium Cobalt Oxide held a dominant market position, capturing more than a 56.9% share of the Photovoltaic (PV) battery chemistry segment. This dominance can be attributed to the chemistry’s high volumetric and gravimetric energy density, which enabled more compact and lightweight pack designs suitable for space-constrained residential and commercial installations. Procurement and project design choices were influenced by predictable discharge profiles and well-understood cycle behaviour, which reduced technical and financial uncertainty for developers and integrators.

During 2024 the technology was favoured for applications where energy density and footprint minimisation were priority requirements, and into 2025 it remained the preferred chemistry for many new PV+storage projects as system planners balanced cost, performance and warranty considerations. Lifecycle management practices, including concerted attention to safety, end-of-life recycling and second-use markets, were increasingly incorporated into procurement specifications to mitigate long-term risks.

By Storage Capacity Analysis

5–10 kWh systems dominate PV battery installations with 39.5% because they offer the best mix of capacity, cost and ease of installation.

In 2024, 5-10 kWh held a dominant market position, capturing more than a 39.5% share of the Photovoltaic (PV) battery storage capacity segment. This band was favoured across residential and small commercial projects because it provided sufficient daily energy shifting for bill management and backup without the higher capital outlay of larger systems. Procurement practices and project specifications were commonly aligned to this capacity range, which simplified stocking, financing and installation processes and reduced lead-time uncertainty for integrators.

System designers preferred 5–10 kWh packs for their straightforward sizing against typical household solar generation profiles, and lifecycle considerations such as warranty terms and expected degradation were easier to model at this scale. In 2025 the segment continued to be the primary choice for new behind-the-meter deployments as market actors prioritized rapid returns on investment and operational simplicity, reinforcing the 5–10 kWh band’s role as the backbone of near-term PV+storage growth.

By Application Analysis

Residential sector leads PV battery adoption with 44.8% as homeowners prioritize resilience and bill savings.

In 2024, Residential held a dominant market position, capturing more than a 44.8% share of the Photovoltaic (PV) battery application segment. This prevalence was driven by widespread behind-the-meter adoption where homeowners sought energy independence, backup power and time-of-use bill reduction; system selection and deployment were routinely aligned to household load profiles and solar generation patterns. Procurement and financing models were adapted to favour rooftop-plus-storage packages, with installers and distributors standardising product bundles and warranty terms to reduce transaction friction.

The residential segment benefited from predictable sizing needs—facilitating faster permitting and installation—and from growing consumer awareness of resilience benefits after grid outages. Into 2025 the residential band remained the primary source of incremental demand for PV-coupled batteries as policy incentives, retail finance options and falling system costs continued to improve the payback case for household storage, reinforcing its role as the largest single application in the near-term PV battery market.

Emerging Trends

Solar-Powered Cold Chains Are Redefining How PV Batteries Are Used

A clear latest trend in Photovoltaic (PV) batteries is their rapid move into food and agriculture cold chains. Instead of just backing up homes or offices, PV batteries now keep milk, fruit, fish and vegetables cold in places where the grid is weak or missing. This is not a niche idea; it responds to a massive food-loss problem that leading food agencies have been highlighting for years. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that roughly one-third of all food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted globally, equal to about 1.3 billion tonnes every year.

More recent FAO SDG data show that 13.3% of food is lost globally after harvest at farm, storage, transport and processing stages in 2023, slightly up from 13.0% in 2015. FAO further notes that post-harvest losses can reach 20% for cereals, 30% for dairy and fish, and 40% for fruit and vegetables, especially in Africa where cooling and storage are weak.

A key part of this trend is the focus on “sustainable cold chains.” The “Chilling Prospects” analysis from Sustainable Energy for All reports that a lack of sustainable cold chain leads directly to around 526 million tonnes of food losses every year, and can cut smallholder farmer incomes by about 15%.

PV batteries are at the centre of new cold-room designs that can run reliably without diesel. For example, a ColdHubs solar-powered cold room in Nigeria uses 5.5 kWp of solar PV, a 2-tonne storage capacity and batteries that are replaced roughly every six years; the unit runs at about 94% utilisation and cost around USD 27,000 to build.

Policy and technical reports are now treating PV batteries as part of the food-system toolkit, not only the power-sector toolkit. A joint FAO–IRENA study notes that global food cold-chain activities already account for around 5% of total food-system emissions, and stresses that renewables-based cooling and storage can cut emissions while reaching remote farming and fishing communities.

Drivers

Rapid Growth of Solar Power and Falling Battery Costs Drive PV Battery Adoption

One of the strongest driving factors for the Photovoltaic (PV) Battery market is the fast global expansion of solar power combined with the steady fall in battery costs. Governments, utilities, and households are installing more solar systems every year, but solar power alone cannot meet electricity needs after sunset or during cloudy periods. PV batteries solve this gap by storing daytime solar energy and supplying it when demand is high, making solar power more reliable and valuable.

Global solar deployment is growing at an unprecedented pace. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the world added around 407 GW of new solar PV capacity in 2023, pushing total installed solar capacity beyond 1.6 TW. This was the largest single-year increase in renewable capacity ever recorded.

As more solar systems connect to power grids, the need for storage rises automatically. The IEA also estimates that to meet global clean-energy and net-zero targets, installed battery storage capacity must reach about 1,300 GW by 2030, compared with less than 60 GW in 2023. A major share of this storage will be paired directly with solar PV plants.

Another key force is the sharp drop in battery prices. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) reports that the average cost of utility-scale battery storage systems fell by about 93% between 2010 and 2024, declining from over USD 2,500 per kWh to below USD 200 per kWh. This dramatic reduction has transformed PV batteries from a premium add-on into a commercially viable solution.

Government policies strongly reinforce this trend. In the United States, the Inflation Reduction Act allows a 30% federal tax credit for standalone battery storage and solar-plus-storage systems installed from 2023 to 2032. This policy has significantly improved project returns for residential and commercial PV battery systems.

Similar initiatives exist elsewhere. The European Union has committed to cutting greenhouse-gas emissions by 55% by 2030 under the “Fit for 55” package. To support this goal, many EU member states provide direct incentives for home batteries linked with rooftop solar, especially in Germany, Italy, and Spain.

Restraints

Raw Material Supply Constraints and Recycling Gaps Limit PV Battery Expansion

A major restraining factor for the Photovoltaic (PV) Battery market is the dependence on critical raw materials and the slow development of large-scale recycling systems. PV batteries, especially lithium-ion types, rely heavily on materials such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, and graphite. While solar installations are accelerating worldwide, the supply chains for these materials are struggling to keep pace, creating cost pressure and long-term availability concerns.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) highlights this challenge clearly. According to its Critical Minerals report, global demand for lithium is expected to increase by more than 3.5 times by 2030 compared with 2023 levels, mainly driven by batteries for energy storage and electric vehicles. However, new lithium mining projects typically take 10–16 years from discovery to production, making rapid supply expansion difficult.

Cost volatility is another concern. The IEA notes that lithium prices increased by nearly 8 times between 2020 and 2022 due to supply shortages, before correcting in 2023. Such price swings directly affect PV battery system costs and make long-term project planning harder for utilities and solar developers.

Recycling could ease this pressure, but current capacity remains limited. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) estimates that while 90–95% of lithium-ion battery materials are technically recyclable, less than 20% of end-of-life lithium batteries were actually recycled globally as of 2023. Most recycling infrastructure today is designed for lead-acid batteries, not modern energy-storage systems.

Grid-scale PV batteries also face regulatory and safety hurdles linked to materials. Fire risks related to thermal runaway have led several governments to impose stricter permitting rules for battery installations. In 2022, incidents at grid-connected lithium-ion storage facilities in the United States prompted updated fire safety guidance from authorities and local regulators, increasing compliance and insurance costs for new projects. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) acknowledges that safety-related standards and testing can add 5–10% to project development costs.

Governments are responding, but solutions will take time. The European Union’s Critical Raw Materials Act targets sourcing at least 10% of critical minerals domestically and recycling 15% by 2030, yet most of these measures are still in early stages. Until these policies translate into operational mines and recycling plants, raw material bottlenecks will continue to restrain PV battery growth.

Opportunity

Rural Electrification and Food Systems Create a Big Opening for PV Batteries

One of the biggest growth opportunities for Photovoltaic (PV) batteries sits where energy and food systems meet: off-grid and weak-grid rural areas that need power for irrigation, cold storage and food processing. Global energy access is still far from universal. A joint SDG7 report led by WHO shows about 685 million people were living without electricity in 2022, and 2.1 billion still lacked clean cooking, with most of them in rural regions.

International initiatives now explicitly link electrification with resilient food systems, creating a clear demand pull for PV battery projects. Under “Mission 300,” the World Bank Group and African Development Bank plan to connect 300 million people in Africa to electricity by 2030, using both grid and distributed renewable solutions such as solar mini-grids and stand-alone systems. Many of these mini-grids are being designed around batteries so that clinics, irrigation pumps and agro-processing equipment can run reliably after sunset and during cloudy days.

There is also a strong climate and emissions angle. FAO has pointed out that solar irrigation can substantially cut greenhouse-gas emissions from water pumping—up to around 95% compared with diesel-powered alternatives—while reducing local pollution and soil contamination from fuel spills. When PV pumps are combined with batteries, farmers can pump during off-peak hours, operate more efficiently, and power cold rooms or milk chillers overnight, which directly reduces food loss.

Food-sector agencies are also pushing solar-plus-storage as part of climate-smart agriculture. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) highlights solar-powered irrigation as a “reliable and affordable” tool that can help small family farmers increase income and strengthen food security in water-stressed regions such as Egypt’s Nile Delta.

Regional Insights

North America leads the PV battery regional market with a 38.90% share and an estimated market value of USD 2.9 billion, driven by mature solar-plus-storage deployment and supportive policy frameworks.

In 2024, North America accounted for a clear regional concentration of PV-battery demand, with a 38.90% share and an indicated market value of USD 2.9 billion. This position was supported by large-scale utility procurements, fast-growing behind-the-meter installations and expanding virtual power plant activity. The regional industrial scene was characterised by a wide mix of applications — residential time-shift and resilience, commercial demand-charge management, and utility-scale PV+storage for capacity firming — which together sustained steady order books and higher average system sizes.

North America’s BESS revenue trajectory underpins this picture: reported regional battery energy storage system revenues were in the low-single-billion USD range in 2024, reflecting rapid year-on-year growth in deployments. Policy and finance mechanisms contributed materially; federal and state incentives, expanded eligibility for storage under tax credit regimes and active grid modernization programmes reduced project risk and supported capital flows. Supply-chain dynamics were shaped by pronounced EV-sector scale-up and ongoing sourcing efforts for critical minerals, prompting heightened attention to recycling and second-life strategies in procurement specifications.

Still, the US energy department last week ordered the plant to remain open for another 90 days.

The Trump administration in May ordered utility giant Consumers Energy to keep the 63-year-old JH Campbell coal plant in western Michigan, about 100 miles north-east of Chicago, online just as it was being retired.

The order has drawn outrage from consumer advocates and environmental groups who say the plant is expensive and emits high levels of toxic air pollution and greenhouse gas.

The costs will be spread among households across the northern and central regional Miso grid, which stretches from eastern Montana to Michigan, and includes nine other states

“The costs of unnecessarily running this jalopy coal plant just continue to mount,” said Michael Lenoff, an attorney with Earthjustice, which is suing over the order.

Gary Rochow, Consumers Energy’s CEO, told investors in a 30 October earnings call that the Trump administration in its order stated that ratepayers should shoulder the costs, and detailed how the company should pass on the costs.

“That order from the energy department has laid out a clear path to cost recovery,” Rochow said.

The utility has said in regulatory filings that the order is costing customers about $615,000 per day. The order has been in place for around six months.

Michigan attorney general Dana Nessel filed a motion for a stay in federal court, alleging the administration’s latest order is “arbitrary and illegal”.

The coal plant is one of two in Michigan that the Trump administration has moved to keep open under the president’s controversial national energy emergency executive order, which is being challenged in court by multiple lawsuits.

The other plant is not scheduled to close for two years. The two factories emit about 45% of the state’s greenhouse gas pollution.

Trump has also used his emergency energy order to keep gas plants near Baltimore and Philadelphia online.

Consumers Energy said it did not ask for Campbell to remain open. The Trump administration did not consult local regulators, a spokesperson for the Michigan public service commission (MPSC), which regulates utilities and manages the state’s grid, told the Guardian in May.

“The unnecessary recent order … will increase the cost of power for homes and businesses in Michigan and across the midwest,” the chair of the MPSC, Dan Scripps, said in a statement at the time.

The latest figures proved Scripps correct.

In May, an energy department spokesperson insisted in a statement that retiring the coal plants “would jeopardize the reliability of our grid systems”.

But regulatory data from Miso and the MPSC over the last six months shows that statement was wrong.

The Miso grid had excess power far above what Campbell provided during peak demand this summer. And the plant often was not operating at full capacity, likely because its power was not needed, advocates say. But the plant still costs ratepayers even when not operating at capacity.

The energy department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the data showing it was not necessary to keep the plant open.

Campbell and Michigan’s other coal plant that the Trump administration is aiming to keep online release high levels of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and particulate matter into the air. Meanwhile, their coal ash ponds leach arsenic, lead, lithium, radium and sulfate into local drinking water and the Great Lakes.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9b34cbdc104d29367bc1633536ccfdc96826c35/451_0_4499_3597/master/4499.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4898b13df89825cba82c6264f049bd8a",N,,2025-11-28 09:02:17.896075

If the AI boom does not deliver, we need a backup plan for energy policy.
Second: AI companies have a capital investment problem.
These are not pure software companies; to provide their inference services, AI companies must all invest in or find ways to access GPUs.","The data center investment boom has already transformed the American economy. It is now poised to transform the American energy system.

Hyperscalers — including tech giants such as Microsoft and Meta, as well as leaders in artificial intelligence like OpenAI and CoreWeave — are investing eyewatering amounts of capital into developing new energy resources to feed their power-hungry data infrastructure. Those data centers are already straining the existing energy grid, prompting widespread political anxiety over an energy supply crisis and a ratepayer affordability shock. Nothing in recent memory has thrown policymakers’ decades-long underinvestment in the health of our energy grid into such stark relief. The commercial potential of next-generation energy technologies such as advanced nuclear, batteries, and grid-enhancing applications now hinge on the speed and scale of the AI buildout.

But what happens if the AI boom buffers and data center investment collapses? It is not idle speculation to say that the AI boom rests on unstable financial foundations. Worse, however, is the fact that as of this year, the tech sector’s breakneck investment into data centers is the only tailwind to U.S. economic growth. If there is a market correction, there is no other growth sector that could pick up the slack.

Not only would a sudden reversal in investor sentiment make stranded assets of the data centers themselves, which will lose value as their lease revenue disappears, it also threatens to strand all the energy projects and efficiency innovations that data center demand might have called forth.

If the AI boom does not deliver, we need a backup plan for energy policy.

An analysis of the capital structure of the AI boom suggests that policymakers should be more concerned about the financial fundamentals of data centers and their tenants — the tech companies that are buoying the economy. My recent report for the Center for Public Enterprise, Bubble or Nothing, maps out how the various market actors in the AI sector interact, connecting the market structure of the AI inference sector to the economics of Nvidia’s graphics processing units, the chips known as GPUs that power AI software, to the data center real estate debt market. Spelling out the core financial relationships illuminates where the vulnerabilities lie.

First and foremost: The business model remains unprofitable. The leading AI companies ― mostly the leading tech companies, as well as some AI-specific firms such as OpenAI and Anthropic ― are all competing with each other to dominate the market for AI inference services such as large language models. None of them is returning a profit on its investments. Back-of-the-envelope math suggests that Meta, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon invested over $560 billion into AI technology and data centers through 2024 and 2025, and have reported revenues of just $35 billion.

To be sure, many new technology companies remain unprofitable for years ― including now-ubiquitous firms like Uber and Amazon. Profits are not the AI sector’s immediate goal; the sector’s high valuations reflect investors’ assumptions about future earnings potential. But while the losses pile up, the market leaders are all vying to maximize the market share of their virtually identical services ― a prisoner’s dilemma of sorts that forces down prices even as the cost of providing inference services continues to rise. Rising costs, suppressed revenues, and fuzzy measurements of real user demand are, when combined, a toxic cocktail and a reflection of the sector’s inherent uncertainty.

Second: AI companies have a capital investment problem. These are not pure software companies; to provide their inference services, AI companies must all invest in or find ways to access GPUs. In mature industries, capital assets have predictable valuations that their owners can borrow against and use as collateral to invest further in their businesses. Not here: The market value of a GPU is incredibly uncertain and, at least currently, remains suppressed due to the sector’s competitive market structure, the physical deterioration of GPUs at high utilization rates, the unclear trajectory of demand, and the value destruction that comes from Nvidia’s now-yearly release of new high-end GPU models.

The tech industry’s rush to invest in new GPUs means existing GPUs lose market value much faster. Some companies, particularly the vulnerable and debt-saddled “neocloud” companies that buy GPUs to rent their compute capacity to retail and hyperscaler consumers, are taking out tens of billions of dollars of loans to buy new GPUs backed by the value of their older GPU stock; the danger of this strategy is obvious. Others including OpenAI and xAI, having realized that GPUs are not safe to hold on one’s balance sheet, are instead renting them from Oracle and Nvidia, respectively.

To paper over the valuation uncertainty of the GPUs they do own, all the hyperscalers have changed their accounting standards for GPU valuations over the past few years to minimize their annual reported depreciation expenses. Some financial analysts don’t buy it: Last year, Barclays analysts judged GPU depreciation as risky enough to merit marking down the earnings estimates of Google (in this case its parent company, Alphabet), Microsoft, and Meta as much as 10%, arguing that consensus modeling was severely underestimating the earnings write-offs required.

Under these market dynamics, the booming demand for high-end chips looks less like a reflection of healthy growth for the tech sector and more like a scramble for high-value collateral to maintain market position among a set of firms with limited product differentiation. If high demand projections for AI technologies come true, collateral ostensibly depreciates at a manageable pace as older GPUs retain their marketable value over their useful life — but otherwise, this combination of structurally compressed profits and rapidly depreciating collateral is evidence of a snake eating its own tail.

All of these hyperscalers are tenants within data centers. Their lack of cash flow or good collateral should have their landlords worried about “tenant churn,” given the risk that many data center tenants will have to undertake multiple cycles of expensive capital expenditure on GPUs and network infrastructure within a single lease term. Data center developers take out construction (or “mini-perm”) loans of four to six years and refinance them into longer-term permanent loans, which can then be packaged into asset-backed and commercial mortgage-backed securities to sell to a wider pool of institutional investors and banks. The threat of broken leases and tenant vacancies threatens the long-term solvency of the leading data center developers ― companies like Equinix and Digital Realty ― as well as the livelihoods of the construction contractors and electricians they hire to build their facilities and manage their energy resources.

Much ink has already been spilled on how the hyperscalers are “roundabouting” each other, or engaging in circular financing: They are making billions of dollars of long-term purchase commitments, equity investments, and project co-development agreements with one another. OpenAI, Oracle, CoreWeave, and Nvidia are at the center of this web. Nvidia has invested $100 billion in OpenAI, to be repaid over time through OpenAI’s lease of Nvidia GPUs. Oracle is spending $40 billion on Nvidia GPUs to power a data center it has leased for 15 years to support OpenAI, for which OpenAI is paying Oracle $300 billion over the next five years. OpenAI is paying CoreWeave over the next five years to rent its Nvidia GPUs; the contract is valued at $11.9 billion, and OpenAI has committed to spending at least $4 billion through April 2029. OpenAI already has a $350 million equity stake in CoreWeave. Nvidia has committed to buying CoreWeave’s unsold cloud computing capacity by 2032 for $6.3 billion, after it already took a 7% stake in CoreWeave when the latter went public. If you’re feeling dizzy, count yourself lucky: These deals represent only a fraction of the available examples of circular financing.

These companies are all betting on each others’ growth; their growth projections and purchase commitments are all dependent on their peers’ growth projections and purchase commitments. Optimistically, this roundabouting represents a kind of “risk mutualism,” which, at least for now, ends up supporting greater capital expenditures. Pessimistically, roundabouting is a way for these companies to pay each other for goods and services in any way except cash — shares, warrants, purchase commitments, token reservations, backstop commitments, and accounts receivable, but not U.S. dollars. The second any one of these companies decides it wants cash rather than a commitment is when the music stops. Chances are, that company needs cash to pay a commitment of its own, likely involving a lender.

Lenders are the final piece of the puzzle. Contrary to the notion that cash-rich hyperscalers can finance their own data center buildout, there has been a record volume of debt issuance this year from companies such as Oracle and CoreWeave, as well as private credit giants like Blue Owl and Apollo, which are lending into the boom. The debt may not go directly onto hyperscalers’ balance sheets, but their purchase commitments are the collateral against which data center developers, neocloud companies like CoreWeave, and private credit firms raise capital. While debt is not inherently something to shy away from ― it’s how infrastructure gets built ― it’s worth raising eyebrows at the role private credit firms are playing at the center of this revenue-free investment boom. They are exposed to GPU financing and to data center financing, although not the GPU producers themselves. They have capped upside and unlimited downside. If they stop lending, the rest of the sector’s risks look a lot more risky.

A market correction starts when any one of the AI companies can’t scrounge up the cash to meet its liabilities and can no longer keep borrowing money to delay paying for its leases and its debts. A sudden stop in lending to any of these companies would be a big deal ― it would force AI companies to sell their assets, particularly GPUs, into a potentially adverse market in order to meet refinancing deadlines. A fire sale of GPUs hurts not just the long-term earnings potential of the AI companies themselves, but also producers such as Nvidia and AMD, since even they would be selling their GPUs into a soft market.

For the tech industry, the likely outcome of a market correction is consolidation. Any widespread defaults among AI-related businesses and special purpose vehicles will leave capital assets like GPUs and energy technologies like supercapacitors stranded, losing their market value in the absence of demand ― the perfect targets for a rollup. Indeed, it stands to reason that the tech giants’ dominance over the cloud and web services sectors, not to mention advertising, will allow them to continue leading the market. They can regain monopolistic control over the remaining consumer demand in the AI services sector; their access to more certain cash flows eases their leverage constraints over the longer term as the economy recovers.

A market correction, then, is hardly the end of the tech industry ― but it still leaves a lot of data center investments stranded. What does that mean for the energy buildout that data centers are directly and indirectly financing?

A market correction would likely compel vertically integrated utilities to cancel plans to develop new combined-cycle gas turbines and expensive clean firm resources such as nuclear energy. Developers on wholesale markets have it worse: It’s not clear how new and expensive firm resources compete if demand shrinks. Grid managers would have to call up more expensive units less frequently. Doing so would constrain the revenue-generating potential of those generators relative to the resources that can meet marginal load more cheaply — namely solar, storage, peaker gas, and demand-response systems. Combined-cycle gas turbines co-located with data centers might be stranded; at the very least, they wouldn’t be used very often. (Peaker gas plants, used to manage load fluctuation, might still get built over the medium term.) And the flight to quality and flexibility would consign coal power back to its own ash heaps. Ultimately, a market correction does not change the broader trend toward electrification.

A market correction that stabilizes the data center investment trajectory would make it easier for utilities to conduct integrated resource planning. But it would not necessarily simplify grid planners’ ability to plan their interconnection queues — phantom projects dropping out of the queue requires grid planners to redo all their studies. Regardless of the health of the investment boom, we still need to reform our grid interconnection processes.

The biggest risk is that ratepayers will be on the hook for assets that sit underutilized in the absence of tech companies’ large load requirements, especially those served by utilities that might be building power in advance of committed contracts with large load customers like data center developers. The energy assets they build might remain useful for grid stability and could still participate in capacity markets. But generation assets built close to data center sites to serve those sites cheaply might not be able to provision the broader energy grid cost-efficiently due to higher grid transport costs incurred when serving more distant sources of load.

These energy projects need not be albatrosses.

Many of these data centers being planned are in the process of securing permits and grid interconnection rights. Those interconnection rights are scarce and valuable; if a data center gets stranded, policymakers should consider purchasing those rights and incentivizing new businesses or manufacturing industries to build on that land and take advantage of those rights. Doing so would provide offtake for nearby energy assets and avoid displacing their costs onto other ratepayers. That being said, new users of that land may not be able to pay anywhere near as much as hyperscalers could for interconnection or for power. Policymakers seeking to capture value from stranded interconnection points must ensure that new projects pencil out at a lower price point.

Policymakers should also consider backstopping the development of critical and innovative energy projects and the firms contracted to build them. I mean this in the most expansive way possible: Policymakers should not just backstop the completion of the solar and storage assets built to serve new load, but also provide exigent purchase guarantees to the firms that are prototyping the flow batteries, supercapacitors, cooling systems, and uninterruptible power systems that data center developers are increasingly interested in. Without these interventions, a market correction would otherwise destroy the value of many of those projects and the earnings potential of their developers, to say nothing of arresting progress on incredibly promising and commercializable technologies.

Policymakers can capture long-term value for the taxpayer by making investments in these distressed projects and developers. This is already what the New York Power Authority has done by taking ownership and backstopping the development of over 7 gigawatts of energy projects ― most of which were at risk of being abandoned by a private sponsor.

The market might not immediately welcome risky bets like these. It is unclear, for instance, what industries could use the interconnection or energy provided to a stranded gigawatt-scale data center. Some of the more promising options ― take aluminum or green steel ― do not have a viable domestic market. Policy uncertainty, tariffs, and tax credit changes in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act have all suppressed the growth of clean manufacturing and metals refining industries like these. The rest of the economy is also deteriorating. The fact that the data center boom is threatened by, at its core, a lack of consumer demand and the resulting unstable investment pathways is itself an ironic miniature of the U.S. economy as a whole.

As analysts at Employ America put it, “The losses in a [tech sector] bust will simply be too large and swift to be neatly offset by an imminent and symmetric boom elsewhere. Even as housing and consumer durables ultimately did well following the bust of the 90s tech boom, there was a one- to two-year lag, as it took time for long-term rates to fall and investors to shift their focus.” This is the issue with having only one growth sector in the economy. And without a more holistic industrial policy, we cannot spur any others.

Questions like these ― questions about what comes next ― suggest that the messy details of data center project finance should not be the sole purview of investors. After all, our exposure to the sector only grows more concentrated by the day. More precisely mapping out how capital flows through the sector should help financial policymakers and industrial policy thinkers understand the risks of a market correction. Political leaders should be prepared to tackle the downside distributional challenges raised by the instability of this data center boom ― challenges to consumer wealth, public budgets, and our energy system.

This sparkling sector is no replacement for industrial policy and macroeconomic investment conditions that create broad-based sources of demand growth and prosperity. But in their absence, policymakers can still treat the challenge of a market correction as an opportunity to think ahead about the nation’s industrial future.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MjIzNzI0Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc5NTAzNzAyMX0.cj-cAOXxehENh2ZdO950EccuUBBZbMqAcS-OlGbh81U/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-11-28 09:01:40.450016

This syndicated debt funding facility – the company’s largest round to date – brings Candi’s total capital raised to over USD 200 million and positions it firmly in the league of trusted, institutional-grade clean energy platforms.

The project will deliver clean, affordable solar solutions in South Africa and India, driving down operational costs and advancing sustainability for Candi’s clients. Candi’s portfolio has more than doubled to 220+ MWp in just 18 months, driven by 85 MWp of open-access projects in India and flagship sites including auto components manufacturer Pricol Limited in India, Ngwenya Lodge in South Africa, and the solar plant at Kings Park Stadium HQ, home of The Sharks rugby team. Candi also powers leading corporations such as IFF (International Flavors & Fragrances SA), Toyota, Pick n Pay, and Suryalakshmi Cotton Mills – proving the strength of its model across manufacturing, retail, and commercial real estate.

A Vote of Confidence in Maturity

IFC’s investment reinforces Candi’s role as a trusted and scalable partner for businesses on their net-zero journey. IFC’s investment comprises:

USD 6.5 million from the Canada-IFC Blended Climate Finance Platform

Up to USD 42 million equivalent for IFC’s own account (composed of rands, rupees, and US dollars) a portion of which is supported by IFC’s Managed Co-lending Portfolio Program (MCPP).

A concessional loan of up to USD 10 million (mixed local rands and rupees) from IFC acting in its capacity as the implementing entity of the Climate Investment Funds’ Clean Technology Fund.

“This is the largest funding facility we have ever closed,” said Bruno Rauis, Director of Candi Solar. “It propels us into our next phase of growth and strengthens our ambition to be the leading distributed energy partner in India, South Africa, and beyond. IFC’s involvement is catalytic – it builds confidence among global investors and enables us to access larger pools of capital to scale faster in the years ahead.”

A Gateway for Global Capital

By blending concessional and commercial components, the IFC-led multicurrency facility (including local currency), which will support Candi’s growth across key regions for distributed generation, is structured to absorb early-stage financial, operational, and performance risks while maintaining stringent ESG and governance standards. This financing structure is not just about enabling Candi’s next phase; it is also about mobilising other global capital to an asset class once considered “too risky.”

“This facility is a strong validation of our results-based model and its ability to deliver reliable returns,” said KJ Mahoney, Head of Capital Structuring at Candi Solar. “IFC’s involvement demonstrates that distributed solar can meet the highest standards of performance, governance, and impact, paving the way for global investors to support this sector at scale.”

“At IFC, we see distributed solar as a powerful lever for accelerating energy access and efficiency in emerging markets,” said Cláudia Conceição, IFC Regional Director for Southern Africa.

“Our partnership with Candi Solar demonstrates how innovative financing models can unlock private capital at scale – supporting small and medium-sized businesses to create jobs, reduce energy costs, and strengthen operational resilience.”

Impact Beyond Megawatts

The facility will directly finance nearly 200 MWp of new projects, with a broader impact on:

Sustainability – advancing clean energy adoption across key industrial clusters to lower emissions.

Resilience – strengthening grid stability for businesses and communities facing power volatility.

Employment & supply chains – creating jobs and building local industrial capacity.

Affordability – giving companies predictable energy costs and long-term competitiveness.

This round follows Candi’s USD 24 million equity and mezzanine raise earlier this year, laying the foundation for a high double-digit-million Series D in 2026.

A Clear Runway to 2026

With this milestone, Candi Solar is preparing for its next growth chapter. By 2026, the company aims to expand its contracted portfolio beyond 400 MWp across India and South Africa, while deepening its performance-linked product suite including storage energy solutions. Candi’s evolution reflects a bigger global story: distributed solar in emerging markets is no longer aspirational – it is proven, investable, and central to the world’s clean energy transition.",https://infrastructurenews.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Candi-Solar-and-IFC-funding-for-solar-projects.png,N,,2025-11-28 10:03:50.404971

Risks

EPS decline -- Patrick Murray reported earnings per share decreased from $0.55 to $0.46, attributing this to the typical seasonal profile of gas utilities where ""Q3 tends to be a softer quarter for EPS as EBITDA is seasonally lower, but items such as interest and depreciation remained flat quarter-over-quarter.""

Mid-Con and U.S. Gulf Coast liquids segment weakness -- Patrick Murray noted that ""contributions from the Mid-Con and U.S. Gulf Coast segment are tracking lower due to tighter differentials and strong PADD II refining demand,"" with these headwinds expected to persist into the fourth quarter.

Flat DCF per share -- Higher financing and maintenance costs from the Enbridge Gas North Carolina acquisition, along with increased interest rates, resulted in flat DCF per share compared to last year.

Takeaways

Adjusted EBITDA -- Achieved a record third quarter adjusted EBITDA, increasing by $66 million compared to the previous year, driven by contributions from U.S. gas utilities and organic growth in gas transmission.

Debt-to-EBITDA ratio -- Reported quarter-end debt-to-EBITDA at 4.8x, staying within the target range of 4.5x to 5.0x.

Mainline throughput -- Liquids mainline transported approximately 3.1 million barrels per day, a third quarter record, attributed to strong demand and high asset utilization.

Secured capital additions -- Added $3 billion of new growth capital to the secured capital program, including the Southern Illinois Connector and expansions in gas storage, pipeline, and CO2 sequestration projects.

Gas storage expansion -- Sanctioned expansions at Egan and Moss Bluff storage for a combined 23 Bcf of capacity and planned expansion of Aitken Creek with 40 Bcf, with half contracted long-term.

Power project execution -- Four renewable projects totaling over 2 gigawatts are backed by agreements with Amazon and Meta, with Fox Squirrel and Orange Grove operational, Sequoia Solar entering service in 2026, and Clear Fork in 2027.

Rate settlements -- Positive settlements reached for Enbridge Gas North Carolina (approved interim rate effective Nov. 1, allowed return on equity of 9.65% and $34 million revenue requirement increase) and Enbridge Gas, Utah (revenue requirement increase of $62 million with rates to begin Jan. 1, 2026), supporting growth and quick cycle capital returns.

Dividend growth commitment -- Maintained a growing dividend within a 60%-70% DCF payout target for 30 consecutive years, underpinned by contracted cash flows and low-risk model.

2025 guidance reaffirmed -- Remains on track for full-year adjusted EBITDA in the upper half of the $19.4 billion to $20 billion guidance range, and adjusted DCF per share near the midpoint of the $5.50 to $5.90 range.

Capacity expansion projects -- Mainline optimization Phase 1 (adding 150,000 barrels per day) near FID, targeted for service in 2027; Phase 2 (250,000 barrels per day) proceeding with Energy Transfer as partner, expected service in 2028, both utilizing existing infrastructure.

Capital allocation limits -- Gregory L. Ebel and Patrick Murray repeated their commitment to retain annual growth investment within the $9 billion to $10 billion envelope, emphasizing disciplined prioritization of brownfield projects.

Customer credit quality -- Over 95% of customers are investment-grade, supporting revenue stability and risk mitigation.

Summary

Enbridge (ENB +1.53%) delivered record adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter, advancing multiple secured growth projects while maintaining leverage within its target range. The company added $3 billion to its secured capital backlog, with new investments in U.S. Gulf Coast storage, pipeline expansions, and carbon sequestration, reinforcing management’s expectation to achieve the upper half of annual EBITDA guidance. Positive regulatory outcomes in its utility businesses will support upcoming revenue and further capital recycling. Management confirmed ongoing expansion in renewables, with new and nearly operational projects secured by long-term agreements with major technology clients. New mainline optimization phases are designed to increase liquids egress using existing assets and partnerships, enhancing system flexibility for customer growth. No change was signaled in the dividend policy or disciplined capital program, and the 2025 outlook was reaffirmed.

Patrick Murray confirmed, ""EPS is down from $0.55 to $0.46 per share,"" reflecting typical seasonal impacts in gas utilities.

Cynthia Hansen specified, ""Egan, the first cavern that we're developing there is about 50% contracted and,"" and Aitken Creek’s 40 Bcf expansion will begin construction early next year.

Michele Harradence said strong data center demand ""could serve up to 5 Bcf a day of demand,"" with nearly 1 Bcf per day already secured, especially in Ohio and Utah.

Colin Gruending explained, ""MLO2, continue the analogy here, I'd say is in the batter's box. And as Pat and Greg mentioned, it's got a bigger bat than we thought we had before. We've upsized that from 150 to 250 a day,"" using joint ventures and emphasizing capital efficiency.

Cynthia Hansen stated, ""We are the only storage in that BC area. So we currently have about 77 Bcf of storage there, and we announced another 40 Bcf. So,"" mainly benefiting upcoming LNG exports.

Gregory L. Ebel said, ""we expect to achieve 5% growth through the end of the decade, supported by our $35 billion in secured capital.""

Patrick Murray emphasized, ""We've grown our dividend for 30 consecutive years,"" attributing this to the stability of contracted and regulated cash flows.

Full Conference Call Transcript

Gregory Ebel: Well, thanks very much, Rebecca, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on the call today. Before we start, I'd like to take a moment to congratulate Cynthia, who announced plans to retire at the end of 2026. Her outstanding leadership and dedication to Enbridge over the past 25 years is inspiring, and I'm grateful that she'll be continuing to provide guidance to our executive team through the end of next year. I'd also like to congratulate Matthew, who will transition to President of our GTM business at the end of this year as well as Allen Capps, who has been appointed to succeed Matthew as the Head of our Corporate Strategy Group and President of our Power business.

As we've said before, and it remains true today, our investment in people creates a deep bench of executive talent to ensure a smooth transition and strong leadership as we move forward. Now moving on to our agenda for this morning. I'm excited to share another strong quarter and highlight the significant progress we've made throughout all segments of our business. It has been a busy quarter for us with new projects serving a wide range of customers across our core franchises. We're going to start today with an update on our financial performance, execution of our increasing number of secured growth projects and prospects.

And I'll also highlight the strong returns and stability our business continues to demonstrate and provide an update on each of our four franchises. Pat will then walk through our financial results and capital allocation priorities. And lastly, I'll close the presentation with a few comments on our First Choice value proposition before we open the line for questions from the investment community. We had another strong quarter of results, including record third quarter adjusted EBITDA. That growth was driven by incremental contributions from a full quarter of U.S. gas utilities and organic growth within our gas transmission business.

This keeps us on track to finish the year in the upper half of our EBITDA guidance, and we expect to land around the midpoint of our DCF per share metric. Our debt-to-EBITDA is 4.8x for the quarter and remains within our leverage range of 4.5 to 5x. Our assets remained highly utilized during the quarter with the mainline transporting approximately 3.1 million barrels per day, a third quarter record, thanks to strong demand. We reached positive settlements at both Enbridge Gas North Carolina and Enbridge Gas, Utah, which we expect to drive growth as rates begin to take effect.

We're still on track to sanction Mainline optimization Phase 1 this quarter and Phase 2 next year, and we'll get into more details on those projects during the business update. Over the quarter, we added $3 billion of new growth capital to our secured capital program, showcasing continued execution on the commitments we laid out last Enbridge Day. In liquids, we sanctioned the Southern Illinois Connector, adding incremental egress out of Western Canada and providing a new long-term contracted service to Nederland, Texas. In Gas Transmission, we sanctioned expansions of our Egan and Moss Bluff storage facilities to support the LNG build-out along the U.S. Gulf Coast.

And in the deepwater Gulf, we're expanding our previously approved Canyon system to provide transportation services for bp's recently sanctioned Tiber Offshore development. And earlier in the quarter, we sanctioned the Algonquin Gas Transmission enhancement project in the U.S. Northeast as well as the Eiger Express gas pipeline out of the Permian. And finally, we have advanced a joint venture with Oxy to develop the Pelican CO2 hub in Louisiana. These projects demonstrate the competitive edge from our all-of-the-above approach and our ability to meet growing energy demand across all parts of our business. Now let's look at our value proposition and recap our year-to-date execution before diving into the business updates.

Enbridge's low-risk model continues to deliver superior risk-adjusted returns in all economic cycles. Our cash flows are diversified from over 200 high-quality asset streams and businesses that are underpinned by regulated or take-or-pay frameworks. Over 95% of our customers have investment-grade credit ratings. We have negligible commodity price exposure and the majority of our EBITDA has inflation protection. All of this results in Enbridge's industry-leading total shareholder return while maintaining lower volatility compared to peers and broad index constituents. Looking ahead, Enbridge's utility-like business model remains well-positioned and policy support for new investment in critical projects is improving, creating a business environment that incents coordination, dialogue, and growth.

And I'm very pleased with how the team continues to grow the business and excited by the opportunities ahead for Enbridge. With that said, let's jump into the business unit updates, starting with Liquids segment. Mainline volumes had another strong quarter, delivering a record 3.1 million barrels per day on average for Q3. The system was a portion for the entire quarter, reflecting continued strong demand for Canadian crude and the need for reliable egress out of the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin. Given the continued strong demand for the Mainline this year, we expect to reach the top of the performance color ahead of when we initially anticipated. This is a great sign for us and our shippers.

We're achieving the maximum allowable returns under the mainline tolling settlement, delivering competitive value to our shareholders and our alignment with customers incentivizes us to move the increased volumes and provide them with access to the best markets. This leads in well to mainline optimization projects that I'll discuss shortly here, in addition to the previously announced projects like Mainline capital investment. In the U.S., we sanctioned the Southern Illinois Connector project, which is backed by long-term contracts for full path service from Western Canada to Nederland, Texas. Once complete, the new pathway will add 100,000 barrels per day of contracted full path capacity to the U.S.

Gulf Coast via a 30,000 barrel increase per day on Express-Platte system, 56 miles of new pipeline between Wood River and Patoka, and utilization of 70,000 barrels per day of existing capacity on the Spearhead Pipeline. Looking ahead at additional egress projects, we are continuing to advance approximately 400,000 barrels per day of incremental capacity to the best refining markets in North America via mainline optimization Phase 1 and 2. MLO1, which will add 150,000 barrels per day of incremental egress is entering the final stages of customer approvals. and we are still on track to make FID this quarter and place the project into service in 2027.

MLO2 has made significant progress as well, and that project could now add another 250,000 barrels per day of additional capacity in 2028. This second phase of mainline optimization will utilize capacity on the Dakota Access Pipeline, and we're happy to announce that we're teaming up with Energy Transfer to make that happen. So stay tuned for more on MLO2, including an open season announcement early in the new year. Relative to potential greenfield projects that would require significant energy policy change, these brownfield opportunities offer the quickest and most cost-effective way to adding close to 500,000 barrels a day of capacity to satisfy the near-term production increases forecasted out of the basin.

Finally, for liquids, we added the Pelican sequestration hub to our backlog, a project in Louisiana, which will provide transportation and sequestration for 2.3 million tons per year of CO2 and is underpinned by 25-year take-or-pay offtake agreements. We will partner with Occidental Petroleum to advance the hub with Enbridge managing the pipeline infrastructure, while Oxy develops the sequestration facility. Now let's turn to our gas transmission business. This quarter, we've sanctioned an additional capital-efficient connection to our Canyon pipeline system to support bp's Tiber development in the deepwater Gulf.

Originally announced last October, the Canyon system will transport both crude oil and natural gas under long-term contracts with the Tiber system expected to cost USD 300 million, taking the total Canyon pipeline development to about USD 1 billion and entering service in 2029. In the U.S. Northeast, the AGT Enhancement will increase capacity of the Algonquin pipeline, providing additional natural gas to the critically undersupplied U.S. Northeast, serving local utility demand and reducing winter price volatility. That project is expected to cost USD 300 million and enter into service in 2029. Switching over to the Permian.

The Eiger Express Pipeline is a 2.5 Bcf a day Permian egress development running adjacent to the operating Matterhorn Express system and is now sanctioned and expected to enter into service in 2028. Since our initial 2024 investment in the Whistler joint venture, which holds these pipelines, we have invested $2 billion in operating assets and sanctioned another $1 billion of capital expected to enter service through 2028. Also in the Gulf region, we've sanctioned two natural gas storage expansions to support the market, which continues to tighten due to increased LNG, Mexican exports, and regional power demand.

Egan and Moss Bluff storage systems, both salt caverns with exceptional connectivity and withdrawal rates are being expanded to offer a combined 23 Bcf of incremental capacity. We expect to invest approximately $500 million in these facilities at 5 to 6x EBITDA builds and come into service in phases through 2033. It's worth taking a moment to dive a little deeper into the growing North American storage market and how we are positioned to serve our customers. Between Moss Bluff and Egan as well as the expansion of Aitken Creek announced last quarter, Enbridge is now set to add over 60 Bcf of new natural gas storage directly adjacent to the major LNG centers in North America.

These expansions will come in a timely manner as there is over 17 Bcf per day of additional LNG-related natural gas demand expected to enter service by 2030. This demand dramatically shifts supply economics and increases the importance of strategically located storage capacity. We are connected to all operating U.S. Gulf Coast LNG terminals and continue to invest heavily in infrastructure to enable the future growth of North American LNG. To date, we have sanctioned over $10 billion in projects with direct adjacency to operating or planned export facilities. There is a growing storage deficit across the U.S.

Gulf and British Columbia coasts and having existing assets with the opportunity to execute brownfield expansions is incredibly valuable to our customers and investors. Through acquisitions and expansions, we have positioned ourselves as an industry leader in the storage space. With more than 600 Bcf of storage across our North American businesses, we can strongly support our customers as they continue to build out North America's LNG capacity and navigate the overall power demand growth we are expecting in the future. Now let's spend a few minutes recapping all the work we've done in Gas Transmission segment since Enbridge Day earlier this year.

At our Investor Day in March, we shared Enbridge's $23 billion gas transmission opportunity set, noting the potential to FIT up to $5 billion in projects within 18 months. This opportunity set has grown since then. And today, a little over 6 months later, we've already announced over $3 billion of new projects across our footprint, serving all pillars of natural gas demand growth, including reshoring, LNG, coal-to-gas switching and data centers. With over 23 Bcf a day of new gas demand coming online by 2030, critical investment will be needed to ensure reliable service for customers.

And with this list here, you can see we are doing our part, deploying capital to meet the significant increase in natural gas demand across North America regardless of the end-use market. Now let's turn to our gas distribution business. The GDS segment is yet another way for us to capitalize on power demand theme. We've seen data center and power gen opportunities continue to be a tailwind for the segment with over 50 opportunities that could serve up to 5 Bcf a day of demand, including almost 1 Bcf per day of demand for already secured projects.

During the quarter, we also reached positive rate settlements with two of our U.S. utility regulators, which are currently being reviewed for final approval. In North Carolina, allowed return on equity increased to 9.65% on an equity thickness of 54%, resulting in a revenue requirement increase of some USD 34 million. The settlement also introduces additional rate riders that allows for quick cycle return of capital for our major projects in North Carolina. These rates came into effect on an interim basis on November 1. In Utah, we filed a settlement for a revenue requirement of USD 62 million, which supports continued investment at attractive returns.

We are expecting a rate order before the end of the year with rates to come in effect on January 1, 2026. Both these rate cases showcase the importance of natural gas as a safe, reliable source of affordable energy. Now I'll continue with the power demand theme with our Renewables segment. As you can see from this slide, renewable projects have been a great place to invest in the last few years, driven by strong PPA prices, decreasing supply costs, and the associated tax benefits. The four projects on this slide showcase over 2 gigawatts of power backed by agreements with some of the largest technology and data center players in the world, including Amazon and Meta.

Fox Squirrel and Orange Grove are currently operational. Sequoia Solar will fully enter service in 2026 and Clear Fork will follow entering service in 2027. Looking ahead, we still have a number of projects in the queue that we're advancing. But as always, we'll remain opportunistic and continue to stand by our strict investment criteria. With that, I'll now pass it to Pat to go over our financial performance.

Patrick Murray: Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. It's been another strong quarter across all four business units, thanks to continued high utilization of our assets as well as recent acquisitions. Compared to the third quarter of 2024, adjusted EBITDA is up $66 million, DCF per share is relatively flat and EPS is down from $0.55 to $0.46 per share. The decrease in EPS is primarily due to the profile change associated with our gas utilities, where Q3 tends to be a softer quarter for EPS as EBITDA is seasonally lower, but items such as interest and depreciation remained flat quarter-over-quarter. In Liquids, despite the strong mainline volumes, contributions from the Mid-Con and U.S.

Gulf Coast segment are tracking lower due to tighter differentials and strong PADD II refining demand. In Gas Transmission, we experienced a strong third quarter with favorable contracting and rate case outcomes on our U.S. gas transmission assets and contributions from the Venice extension and the Permian joint ventures we added since last year. The Gas Distribution segment is up relative to last year, thanks to a full quarter contribution from Enbridge Gas North Carolina as well as benefit of the quick turn capital we experienced within our Ohio utility. In Renewables, results were up from last year with higher contributions from our wind assets and from the Orange Grove solar facility recently placed into service.

Higher financing and maintenance costs from the acquisition of the Enbridge Gas North Carolina assets kept DCF per share relatively flat year-over-year. I'm pleased to once again reaffirm our 2025 guidance and growth outlook across all metrics. Our resilient business model positions us to deliver strong and predictable results through all cycles. We remain confident we will achieve full year EBITDA in the upper half of our guidance range of $19.4 billion to $20 billion, but don't expect to exceed the top of the band. As we mentioned on previous quarterly calls, due to higher interest rates, particularly in the U.S., we continue to expect DCF per share at the midpoint of our $5.50 to $5.90 per share guidance range.

Mainline volumes, FX rates, and the acquisition of an interest in the Matterhorn Express Pipeline earlier in the year continue to be the tailwinds to the full year guide. This is partially offset by higher interest rates, along with tight differentials and strong PADD II refining levels, which are expected to continue into the fourth quarter and thus have been reflected as an additional headwind relative to our assumptions heading into the year. Now let's quickly discuss our capital allocation priorities. We remain firmly committed to a thoughtful capital discipline process, remaining within our $9 billion to $10 billion per year annual growth investment capacity as we pursue the wide suite of opportunities ahead.

Our highly contracted cash flows support a growing and ratable dividend within our 60% to 70% DCF payout target range, ensuring long-term shareholder returns. We've grown our dividend for 30 consecutive years, a real testament to the stability of our business and the fundamentals that underpin it. On the leverage front, our consolidated net debt to adjusted EBITDA remains comfortably within our target range of 4.5 to 5x. This quarter, we saw $3 billion of newly sanctioned capital advanced.

As I've mentioned in the past, I like the fact that we're generating opportunities in all of our businesses, supplementing the next few years with accretive projects while also adding visibility into the back part of the decade with opportunities like our gas storage expansions and our offshore gas transmission projects, which we've announced this quarter. Our capital allocation focus will remain with brownfield, highly strategic and economic projects supported by underlying energy fundamentals, and I'm excited to see this opportunity set materialize into the future. With that, I'll pass it back to Greg to close the presentation.

Gregory Ebel: Thanks very much, Pat. It was indeed a busy quarter on the growth capital side, and I'm extremely pleased with the progress we've made since Enbridge Day in March. The North American energy landscape continues to evolve with energy demand driven by LNG development, power generation, data centers and baseload growth. Enbridge will continue to play a pivotal role in that growth within a disciplined framework that delivers consistent long-term shareholder value. Our low-risk utility-like business with predictable cash flows is underpinned by long-term agreements and regulatory mechanisms that has allowed us to increase our dividend for 30 consecutive years across a wide range of economic cycles and conditions.

Going forward, we expect to achieve 5% growth through the end of the decade, supported by our $35 billion in secured capital. Our scale offers optionality that few in our industry possess, and we'll continue to evaluate accretive investments across our footprint. Lastly, I'll just point out one housekeeping item. As has been typical, we intend to issue our '26 guidance for investors in early December. So please watch for that announcement on December 3. With that, I'll open the call to questions.

Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from the line of Spiro Dounis from Citi.

Spiro Dounis: I wanted to start with gas distribution and storage. The release mentioned seeing an acceleration there in commercial activity and it sounds like demand from data centers and power being those initial expectations. So just a multipart question here, but curious what's suddenly driving that acceleration, if there's a particular region where you're seeing it? And how are you thinking about the time frame for when these could start to materialize?

Michele Harradence: Sure. So it's Michele Harradence here, Spiro, and happy to discuss that. And I would say we're seeing it across the board. I mean that's the real value of the diversity of the utilities we have. So -- when we look at about the projects that make up that 7 Bcf or so of data center opportunities that we're talking about, we divide that aspect into what I'd call our baseload demand, our data centers itself and the coal to gas. So it's a lot about power generation. It's the electrification tailwind that we've talked about.

So you could bucket that, I would say, the baseload demand is there in Ontario, it's there in Ohio, it's there in Utah, data center growth, lots of early-stage developments in Ohio and Utah in particular. I would say we're seeing up to 8 gigawatts between the two of them. And that's some of the early-stage developments we're seeing. And then the mid-stage stuff, we're estimated to be serving over 6 gigawatts in those two jurisdictions alone. And Ontario has a lot of growth as well. And then finally, coal-to-gas conversion, again, to support power generation would be in North Carolina.

But really, when we look across all the capital opportunities we have for GDS, that's maybe 20% of what we're looking at is the data center and power generation opportunity. I mean just the good standard core utility growth, leveraging our modernization program, still lots of opportunity there. We're seeing a lot of what I'd call major projects. We just put our Panhandle regional project into service. That's close to $360 million in Southwest Ontario. We have our Moriah Energy Center, the LNG plant in North Carolina. We have 215 Phase 1 and 2 in North Carolina. That's -- those two combined are USD 1.2 billion alone. We're doing a reinforcement project in Ontario up in Ottawa.

That's another $200 million. I mean, there's a lot of growth and opportunity going on in the utilities. And then our residential growth, although it softened in Ontario, continues to be strong in places like North Carolina and Utah, where there's a lot of folks coming. And finally, we're looking at our storage opportunities, and there's a good chunk of our capital that continues to go to storage for us. So a good suite of capital there, but hopefully, that answers your question.

Gregory Ebel: Yes. Good upside, Spiro, from what we thought when we bought the assets 2 years ago. We didn't -- a lot of the folks hadn't seen the data center, particularly in places like Ohio, we knew Utah and North Carolina would grow nicely. But Ohio, the opportunity there that's happening on the industrial side and the power side and data center related is really great.

I think people are kind of forgetting the fact it's not just about power right across the board, not only the secondary benefits, i.e., industrial growth, caterpillars, GEs, et cetera, having to build things and equipment, there's tertiary growth associated with DC and AI, which is really going to drive all these commodities, including oil, as you see, higher GDP, higher industrial growth. Who's building all this stuff? They're using gasoline, they're using diesel, they're using oil. And that -- so I see it right across the entire system.

Spiro Dounis: Great. That's helpful color. Second question, maybe just going to Line 5. You all recently received a favorable decision from the Army Corps there. And it sounds like you expect state permits to be confirmed soon. So just curious how you're thinking about starting construction on that segment? And how do the outstanding item in Michigan play into next steps here?

Colin Gruending: Sure, Spiro. It's Colin here. So I'll try to abbreviate this answer, sometimes Line 5 questions get a little longer. But I would say that the permitting on both the Wisconsin reroute and the Michigan tunnel are regaining momentum, obviously, with the White House and energy security and just getting things done. So I would say that we are -- in Wisconsin here, we're awaiting the administrative law judges findings on the hearing that we've recently completed should have that soon. And we'd look to complete the Wisconsin reroute in 2027 and the tunnel is a few years behind that.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Aaron MacNeil from TD Cowen.

Aaron MacNeil: It's great to see the new disclosure around Mainline optimization Phase 2. Am I right to view this as an acceleration in terms of the cadence that you're planning to offer expanded egress to Canadian producers? And if so, what's driving that expedited timing? Is it customer demand? Is it sort of a race to be first to market? How should we think about it?

Gregory Ebel: Well, maybe I'll start with a little context because I think you're right. This is maybe not one some people expected, although I'd say people have always underestimated what we can do with that super system. So remember, first of all, you got customers out there that are in particular Canadian customers looking at from an oil sands perspective, you don't have the type of depletion issues that are going on in some of the shale plays. You've got a strong U.S. dollar, which is critical, driving netbacks. So you got quite a different environment going on, obviously, in Canada and some other jurisdictions that analysts may focus from that perspective.

But really the attitude of customers and what we can offer. But Colin, do you want to talk about that super system element of it?

Colin Gruending: Yes. I think -- I don't know that it's an acceleration here per se. I think it's being game on here for a while here. And I think the Canadian basin, as Greg was saying, is it turns out relatively advantaged compared to other basins. So maybe we have lost focus on it, but our customers haven't. And we've been all over the fundamentals, we see that 500,000, 600,000 a day of supply growth by the end of the decade. And I think our announcements here line up with what we talked about at Enbridge Day generally.

I mean, the team is working hard on this, and I'm very proud of them, the engineering and commercialization of it is very creative and trying to seize the moment. Yes, if there's bigger policy unlocks, there could be much more upside to monetize the trillions of dollars of value up in Northern Alberta. But even under the base case, the 600,000 a day is significant. We have, I think, consistently talked about our southbound playbook. And again, if there is an unlock much bigger, then the West solution can come into focus, kind of a companion to that unlock. But in the base case, South is where it's at.

Our customers prefer that direction, integrated business models, lots of big efficient, long-lived refineries that are very competitive and of course, less competition now from Venezuela and Mexico, inbound heavy. So Canadian Oil will gain market share in that basin. I think our solution set is unchanged. We're proud to sanction Southern Illinois Connector. Maybe in baseball terms, that's our leadoff hitter, and it's now on base. We've sanctioned this. This is a dual flow path, 30,000 new egress on Platte and the other 700 coming down our spearhead pipeline existing capacity, and we're going to move that on ETCOP with our -- which we partially own with our partner Energy Transfer.

MLO1 is at the plate right now, and we expect to make commercializing announcement here in the next couple of months before year-end. Again, that's 150 a day. I think that's well chronicled. It's capital efficient. permit light using existing pipe in a right of way. And recall, we've already successfully run an open season on the Flanagan South path through Seaway with our partner enterprise products. So that's well advanced. So MLO2, continue the analogy here, I'd say is in the batter's box. And as Pat and Greg mentioned, it's got a bigger bat than we thought we had before. We've upsized that from 150 to 250 a day.

And again, similar to MLO1, existing pipe and right of way. And so again, using joint venture partners, this is all coming together nicely, not an acceleration, but I think continuing through here and hopefully get the basis loaded.

Gregory Ebel: Yes. I hope -- and obviously, not lost on you, Aaron, but as Colin goes through that, you just tick off all those pipeline systems. And it's not just about the mainline. You got Express-Platte, you got ETCOP, you got DAPL, which we own all of our parts of right through the whole system. So there's multiple ways for us to serve our customers and multiple ways for our investors to win. And that's the pretty exciting part that I don't always feel gets fully valued in the market for sure.

Aaron MacNeil: That's a ton of great context. As a related follow-up, a significant portion of the $35 billion of secured capital comes into service in 2027. As we think about all these liquids projects that you just outlined, continued success in GTM, steady growth across the utilities. Do you see sort of a, I guess, what I'll call a high plateau in terms of capital entering into service towards the end of the decade? And do you see any timing or capital sequencing issues to maintain the spend between $9 billion and $10 billion?

Gregory Ebel: Maybe Pat will want to add to this, but I don't think so. I mean, we're constantly adding to the back end. Look, I think that's not unusual for companies like ourselves. Just go through the stuff that Colin went through, right? You're talking '27, '28 and then '29, '30, you'll see additional pieces as well. The gas trend deep Gulf stuff is all '29. Storage piece comes in some late '29, '30. So I think it will stay up at that amount. That's what gives us the confidence on 5% growth. It's a bit of a flywheel that's going on right now, which is quite positive.

But from a balance sheet perspective, we feel very good about that 9 to 10. Pat?

Patrick Murray: Yes, I think so at the end of the day, we've got a pretty fulsome '26 now. We've reserved some capacity for these MLO 1s and 2s. I mean, 1, we'll have some spend in '26; 2, probably not as large as it's a little later, but we'll reserve some capacity given how confident we now are in those moving forward. And then as Greg said, we're really happy to continue to build out the back part of the decade. And hopefully, that's adding a lot of clarity into the growth that the enterprise can have.

And I think it's pretty common in our infrastructure business where you got -- you have secured some capital for the next couple of years. It's kind of close to or just below your kind of capacity in any out years you're filling up. And I think the team has done a great job in the last 6 months of doing that. So we're very comfortable.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan.

Jeremy Tonet: Just want to kind of maybe follow up a little bit on the last line of questions there with regards to growth over time and having talked about this 5% EBITDA growth potential over the medium term post '26. And I know you're not going to give us the December update today, but just wondering any foreshadowing you might be able to provide us here or thoughts into how we should be thinking about how that update could unfold?

Gregory Ebel: Yes. I'm not sure we are going to give you much of that right now because as you say it's December. But look, I think -- look, you've heard what we've been able to do on the gas side today with announcements. The liquid side, Michele gave you a good tour to tab on that side as well. And despite what some people have looked at, we've even done a number of things on the renewable power side in the last year. So I think it's the benefit of the portfolio.

And again, those secondary and tertiary benefits of everything from power demand, from policy changes, from GDP growth that actually give us that confidence, and we see growth right across the system. So if your question is, do we see pullbacks in areas? No. In fact, we see acceleration even the renewable stuff that we have, a lot of that stuff is a long ways down the trail and anything we do sanction would have already been in a good spot from a policy perspective. So -- and as Pat just mentioned, we've got the balance sheet capacity, internally generated cash flow to be able to meet those demands.

And obviously, every dollar of EBITDA we add adds another $4 or $5 of capacity. So we're very focused on that. So it's probably where I'd leave it today. I don't know, Pat, would you add anything further?

Patrick Murray: Yes. I mean I think our message, if you remember back 6 months ago at Enbridge Days was that the whole goal here was to add clarity into that back end of the decade growth rate. And I think it's fair to say that we're doing a substantial amount of projects that should help to clarify that. So we're confident in the growth rates that we've put forward, and we'll continue to add to this backlog. We know there's more to come in really every business, which is what I like the most about it. We've got a very diverse set of opportunities over what really turns out to be a 5- to 7-year time line now.

So yes, we're feeling good about the growth rates.

Jeremy Tonet: Fair enough. I figure it's worth a try. Just wanted to dive in a little bit more into Western Canada and gas storage there. With LNG Canada ramping up. Just wondering if you could provide maybe a little bit more color on the tone of customer conversations there. It seems like the market is going to need a lot more logistics. You're expanding gas storage capacity there. Just wondering if you could elaborate any more on how you see this unfolding. It seems like these would be fundamental tailwinds to rates and economics overall, but just wondering what you guys are seeing.

Cynthia Hansen: Yes. Thanks, Jeremy. It's Cynthia Hansen. I would agree with you that we are having these tailwinds, particularly when it comes to storage. Of course, in the last quarter, we'd announced our expansion, a significant expansion of our Aitken Creek storage. We are the only storage in that BC area. So we currently have about 77 Bcf of storage there, and we announced another 40 Bcf. So that will -- we'll start construction of that in the first part of next year, and that will be in service in a couple of years following that.

When we have the conversations, it was -- when we announced that opportunity, we had 50% of that storage signed up right away in a long-term contract. So -- our customers understand that there is that opportunity and they're willing to back that kind of expansion. As we continue to look at other opportunities, the current discussions about LNG Canada Phase 2, all of that creates an opportunity, not just for our storage, but for the opportunities to expand our West Coast system. We've announced earlier this year the Birch Grove, which is an expansion of T-North that ties into that, too.

So strong opportunities, but I would say that we'd like to continue to see that growth of those opportunities for LNG export. That will need the support of the BC and Canadian government as we go forward to make sure that we are positioning those projects to attract the capital they need in the long term to support that opportunity.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Catellier from CIBC Capital Markets.

Robert Catellier: I'd like to go back to the Data Center and Power Generation opportunities. Obviously, that's a hot part of the market right now. And I think your own gas distribution business is advancing more than $4 billion of related projects. Can you provide some detail on how you're managing cost risk, in particular, in areas like that, that are hot and where there's a lot of competition, supply chain constraints and customer focus on time to market?

Gregory Ebel: Yes. Obviously, several areas there. And as they relate to the gas distribution side, obviously, prudency kicks in. But recall, those are rate base type driven setups, right? So you're getting on a capital structure, call it, 10% return in the U.S. on about 50% equity. So as long as we're being prudent, I'm not feeling too concerned about that. Now that being said, given the size of the company, we are actively and we're out there doing that, making sure that we've got good alliance agreements with various contractors, giving us the best rates, actually going forward and even stockpiling, if you will, compressors and things like that.

And remember, on the inflationary side, I'd say about 30% most of these large projects would be CapEx related to equipment and things like that. So those relationships are really critical. And a lot of them, obviously, we're avoiding tariff structures through contract mechanisms as well. So far, so good. The biggest concern I have is on the people side of things and just getting the time and equipment in place. So we're pretty good at that. I think we feel in terms of those long-term relationships with contractors and stuff like that. But Rob, it's something definitely we're watching closely.

It's also why I love some of the projects that we announced today that are all relatively small, as Colin said, singles and doubles and quick cycle, relatively speaking, so that you don't have long drawn-out processes. And then the last piece is, as you know, a better attitude with policy around permitting and acceptance of these critical projects. And that takes a risk off the table from a CapEx perspective as well.

Robert Catellier: Okay. That's very helpful. And then a bit of a regulatory question here for Colin, and maybe we'll have to take this offline. But I'm curious about the Mainline optimization too and the interplay with the Dakota Access Pipeline, given there's still some lingering permitting issues there. So maybe, Colin, you could walk us through whatever relevant regulatory updates on DAPL that relate to the Mainline optimization too.

Colin Gruending: Yes. Sure, Robert. And it's a good question and one we've thought through. So we don't need a new presidential permit across the border. And we're confident that the DAPL EIS will come through in the spirit of energy security and energy dominance. So we're confident in that line of thinking.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Hope from Scotiabank.

Robert Hope: You've mentioned a couple of times that the policy environment is getting better for energy infrastructure. In Canada, how are you interfacing with the Canadian major projects office? Enbridge has over, we'll call it, $8 billion of projects in development in BC. You could do more on the liquid side there as well. Is there a way to get incremental support to further derisk these projects?

Gregory Ebel: Yes. At this point in time, we haven't put projects through the office. It's great that it's set up. Hopefully, that will be helpful for those national interest projects. But most of the things or all the things we're talking about are short cycle, relatively permit light. And so we haven't seen the need to go down that route. But that being said, we've had several conversations with them. Obviously, Don is well known in the industry and respected and has been very good to don't hesitate if you need some help around permits, et cetera, and working through the lab of the Canadian government. So we won't hesitate.

But to date, and I don't see that actually on any of the projects that we have. As you know, we have several billion dollars of projects being done in BC, things Colin's talked about today. But a lot of them are relatively permit light and even not giant CapEx as individual chunks. So I just don't see us using the major project office at this point in time.

Robert Hope: Appreciate that color. And then maybe just going back to the Mainline. I appreciate all the details on further expansions, Colin. But maybe to dive in a little deeper, and I know it's early days, but what would an MLO3 look like? And how much more incremental capacity do you think you can get out of the basin without, we'll call it, a good amount of large diameter pipe?

Colin Gruending: Robert, you're reading my mind. So we've got some hitters warming up in the dug out. MLO3 and 4 are stretching. Our engineers are looking at that as well because there is a scenario here, right, where Canada and the U.S. do a bigger trade deal and energy is part of it. And the imperative may accelerate further. So we do have some, again, in-corridor in fence line solutions for that. But it's premature for us to probably talk about those.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Manav Gupta from UBS.

Manav Gupta: We are actually seeing a lot of resurgence in solar stocks in the U.S., and you actually have a very strong solar portfolio. But because you have everything else, which is also so good, sometimes it's underlooked. So can you talk a little bit about your renewables portfolio and solar in particular and more deals like Clear Fork with Meta, if you could talk on those points, please?

Matthew Akman: Sure. Manav, it's Matthew here. Yes, you're quite right. I mean I think investment discipline is the order of the day in renewables, given some of the cross currents in the policy landscape, but we have to keep our eye also on the opportunity here because the customer demand for this remains very, very strong. We are still in the window where we've got interconnection-ready projects that are in fantastic locations with strong local support and great resource while the production tax credit window remains open. And so there's definitely a lot of interest from customers on the data center side around that, in particular, on our solar portfolio. We've talked about Project Cowboy out in Wyoming.

We are building a lot of stuff, as you know, you mentioned Clear Fork with Meta and ERCOT. But that Wyoming project has a tremendous amount of interest. and is potentially a very big one and is well advanced. And so again, we're going to be navigating carefully, but there should be win-wins here because customers know that there's this window. And there aren't that many projects that can actually get in into their windows and they need the electrons, and they want it, if possible, lower zero emissions. So I think we're really well positioned.

But again, we'll be navigating this and with a very close eye on our risk profile and making sure that we are consistent with our low-risk business model across everything we do.

Manav Gupta: Perfect. My quick follow-up is your partner, Energy Transfer, talked about the Southern Illinois connector, exactly the kind of crude that U.S. refiners need. Can you also highlight some of the benefits of this project? And can you confirm if this is probably 2028 start-up, if you could talk a little bit about that?

Colin Gruending: Yes. Thanks, Manav. Yes, I agree with your thesis. And what else can I tell you here? This is a new market off our mainline system to Nederland, Texas. And yes, you can imagine we've got a map of all the refineries, and we're trying to feed all of them. We've got about 75% of U.S. refineries connected to our Mainline system. So this isn't a new market for us. technically not super complex using existing capacity on spearhead, just longer hauling that capacity.

It used to go to the Patoka area, now that 100 -- of the 200 on Spearhead will go down in Nederland, Texas, and we're expanding the Platte system, I think pretty simple scope there, pump refurbishment. So high confidence execution. And so yes, the time line should work.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sam Burwell from Jefferies.

George Burwell: Some of this has been touched on already, but just a quick one on Southern Illinois and the whole path. So I mean the Mainline optimization seem like they're on the right track and Mainline volumes were 3Q record. But downstream of that, low volumes in 3Q, and it seems like it's going to be a headwind in 4Q as well. So just curious if you have a view on when that could improve? And then is there anything to read into the 100,000 barrels a day capacity on Southern Illinois because I think the open season figure was higher than that, like 200. So just curious on your thoughts on full pass volumes improving over time.

Colin Gruending: Sure. I can take that. So I think it's a temporary anomaly here. That path on our liquid system south of Chicago down to the Gulf has been pretty robustly used for a long time. It's been recently weaker, still pretty good, but a little bit weaker as you saw in our disclosures, Pat talked about it. That is due really not the weakness the South per se, but more so that, that demand, that upper PADD II demand has been unusually strong in the last quarter or 2. So higher absorption of that high Mainline throughput, just a bit further North. And so double-click on that, why is that? A couple of reasons.

One, our product levels were lower given fuel demand. And so those refiners were running pretty hard, so higher utilizations to replenish those inventories. And secondly, they had I would say, higher than average just uptime. And so the combination of those two factors kept a lot of that mainline oil at home, so to speak, in the upper PADD II market. I think Q4 should be maybe a little better than Pat suggested. We've seen some early quarter improvements here. And then moreover, I think just longer term, we've got a lot of confidence in that path. In fact, we just have successfully run two open seasons for that path, both have been oversubscribed to expand it.

So I'd say it's a temporary effect. You also asked about 200 versus 100, yes, pardon me. So yes, we're pretty happy with the 100 with our partner there. We actually had oversubscription for the 100, but we end up settling it at 100. It's just the most efficient kind of sweet spot on that project for economics overall.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ben Pham from BMO Capital Markets.

Benjamin Pham: I wanted to touch base first on the Woodside LNG project. Could you remind us going forward how the mechanism works on the contract as you close on the in-service dates?

Gregory Ebel: Yes, I think you mean Woodfibre. Cynthia can take that, right? You mean...

Benjamin Pham: Woodfibre, sorry.

Cynthia Hansen: Yes. Yes. Thank you. Yes. So the way our contract works is that we will be setting that final toll closer to the in-service date. So with our contract terms, we will get our return based on that toll structure that's finalized at that date. So we continue to benefit from the delay in that term as the cost increase and that will allow us to actually have limited exposure to some of these cost overruns that we're starting to see on that project. Now -- we are really excited, though, that we're 50% complete overall on the construction, and we believe that there's a really strong path to getting us to the 2027 in-service date.

Gregory Ebel: Now the other thing, we'll have to see how it plays out, but the Canadian budget did have some accelerated bonus depreciation for LNG projects that have low emissions. And I think as we've talked about before, this will be amongst, if not the lowest emission LNG project globally given how it's getting its power. So we'll watch for that, which should be helpful from a return perspective as well.

Benjamin Pham: Got it. And I have to chuck when I said Woodside because I do have a follow-up question on that partnership more specifically. Just think about your investments in on the BC Coast. And I'm curious just with LNG additions ahead and some of the strategic partnership you've seen with Williams in particular, is there appetite for Enbridge, may not something specifically like that, but maybe just appetite for LNG beyond what we have right now.

Gregory Ebel: Yes. Ben, we're not opportunity light. We are opportunity rich. So us taking on -- I can't see us taking on an LNG facility with commodity exposure, which is what some other folks that you mentioned have done. We'll get done the Woodside opportunity here, and then we'll see. Obviously, there's a lot of water still to go under the bridge about getting things built in off the BC Coast. So let's continue with our Woodfibre project. Sorry, I said Woodside. Now you got me saying it. The Woodfibre project before we look at other ones. And Look, you saw us announce today those storage projects are serving LNG on the Gulf Coast.

Aitken is going to serve LNG in BC. A lot of the projects that Cynthia mentioned, the pipeline project, that's the stuff we know and know very well and earn solid regulated rates of return on. I think in this environment, that's probably a better setup for us. So we'll always look. We get an opportunity to take a look at everything, but I don't think our investor proposition is open to taking on a bunch of commodity exposure. We don't want to.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Maurice Choy from RBC Capital Markets.

Maurice Choy: First question is about your crude oil production growth projections. I remember back in Enbridge Day, you've made a forecast that you may see more than 1 million barrels a day of growth through to 2035. Assuming that projection was made based on the landscape at that point in time, how would you view this growth now given what appears to be a supportive regulatory and political landscape in Canada?

Colin Gruending: This is Colin. Yes, great question. And I think our -- I think both of those projections are, I think, internally consistent, and I think our view of that is stable. There is an upside scenario here that if Canadian federal policy comes through on this vision of a global energy superpower, which we believe in strongly. We have a unique perch on that. I think there is upside -- there's for sure upside in that scenario. But it's an if at this point. So we've calibrated our business plan to the base case and are -- to a question a few minutes ago, are generating further solutions if the upside comes to be.

Gregory Ebel: You're going to get a good insight on that, I think, as well, Maurice, right? Because if the policy conditions form in Canada that ensure that as a producing nation, it's actually competitive. The first sign of that is going to be our producers and then being more optimistic about production, and then we'll be able to react as capital forms. So -- but at this point in time, we wouldn't change the million by 2035. And the MLOs and the Southern Illinois Connector and our Mainline investment capital is all consistent with how we see that rolling out between now and the end of the decade, all other things being equal.

Maurice Choy: That makes sense. If I could finish off with a question on the Pelican CO2 hub. Oftentimes, these types of projects are perceived to have a lower return than the 4 to 6x build multiple that you can deliver within liquids pipeline outside the Mainline. Recognizing that you do have an internal competition for capital among your various businesses, I wonder if you could comment on the returns here or just more broadly about lower carbon opportunities, how do they compete for capital internally?

Gregory Ebel: Yes. Look, I think both ourselves and Oxy are pretty darn careful on this front. If this project didn't earn at least the returns that we get from other Liquids projects, as you say, outside the Mainline, it wouldn't have got sanctioned. So obviously, I would even argue there's always some policy risk, so you want to make sure you get this right. So this is very much in that wheelhouse, if not a bit better. And obviously, the tax incentive structures, we've got a lot more clarity on that out of the OBBB bill that came out so that we know exactly what our tax incentives are on that.

And it's got a long-term 20-, 25-year contract with offtake player. So I would say returns are at least, if not a little bit better than what we're seeing in this world. Policy support is there where it may not be for some of the other unconventional investments. And we love our partner on this front who has very similar return type parameters.

Maurice Choy: I might just add on that.

Colin Gruending: I was just going to layer on that it's a very selective investment. We're going to take a crawl, walk, run approach to developing low-carbon infrastructure. I think the pace of it generally is a lot slower than most observed a few years ago. So we're going to take a very careful and disciplined approach here, as Greg mentioned.

Maurice Choy: It's great to hear. My -- I guess, all the best to Cynthia on your retirement, and congrats to Matthew in your new role.

Cynthia Hansen: Thank you.

Matthew Akman: Thank you.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Theresa Chen from Barclays.

Theresa Chen: I would also like to congratulate Cynthia on her retirement. Thank you for all your insights over the years, and I'd like to congratulate Matthew as well on his new role. Going back to the discussion around the Mainline expansion. So when it comes to resourceful solutions for moving incremental WCS barrels to the U.S. Gulf Coast, leveraging your JV system with Energy Transfer is certainly a capital-efficient approach. And as the downstream southbound capacity fills up over time, have you or would you also consider partnering with other pipelines such as topline, which also runs from the upper Mid-Continent to the Gulf Coast and currently has available capacity?

Colin Gruending: Yes, Theresa. And I think joint ventures are a big part of Enbridge's playbook. Cynthia has got a bunch, Matthew's got a bunch. We've got a bunch in our portfolio, and we're proud to partner with basically everyone in the industry. And I think that's going to be a part of everybody's playbook going forward. We also partner with enterprise products on Seaway. We've gone from 0 barrels a day through that system to what's going to be not far from now, 1 million barrels a day. So I think we've utilized joint ventures extensively. We've got a whole bunch of others across the system as well. So we're open to that.

I think teamwork makes the dream work here in an exciting environment.

Theresa Chen: Got it. And looking at your medium-term outlook, not asking you to front run the guidance update to come, but just looking at what's already out there, how do you plan to align DCF per share growth with EBITDA growth over time, that 5% -- given that DCF per share has recently trailed EBITDA growth, what are the key drivers in bridging the two over time?

Patrick Murray: Yes, it's Pat. Thanks for the question. Yes, I think we have been pretty clear that the reason they kind of disconnected over the last couple of years was primarily related to cash taxes, and we see that plateauing. We've seen some pretty positive tax decisions made in the U.S. There's lots of conversations about things that could happen in Canada. But generally, we just see that the cash taxes are returning to be more in line with -- not having the growth that it had over the last number of years. So that's why those two primarily converge as you move later into the decade.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Praneeth Satish from Wells Fargo.

Praneeth Satish: On the Egan and Moss Bluff gas storage expansions, can you break down how much of the 23 Bcf of capacity is already committed under long-term contracts versus any shorter-term contracts or merchant capacity? And then given that you're moving forward with the expansion, I assume pricing is favorable, much higher than historical levels. But can you provide some color on the contract durations? Is it kind of in the typical 3- to 5-year range? Or are you able to get something longer in this environment?

And then I guess as a follow-up to that, like how do you think about the trade-off between locking in longer storage term contracts versus keeping them shorter so you could potentially benefit from higher recontracting rates in the future?

Cynthia Hansen: Thanks, Praneeth. It's Cynthia. I would say that where we are right now, we have Egan, the first cavern that we're developing there is about 50% contracted and we'll, over a period of time, lag into that. We're managing these assets. It's an existing portfolio. So we're going to manage those contract terms consistently with how we've operated those assets. When we look at the overall contract terms, it is a speed from that 2- to 5-year kind of average overall. We always look for those longer terms as to be part of that portfolio.

But as you noted, just with the opportunities right now as we continue to see the demand for storage increase, and we've seen some strong pricing associated with that, that's really supporting this ongoing development that we're doing. We want to try and manage the portfolio to really optimize that structure as we go forward.

Gregory Ebel: Yes. And that 3 to 5 years, 2 to 5 years is pretty typical the way that we've done it historically. And look, I think we've got a super high level of confidence in the LNG coming in on the Gulf Coast. So that probably lets us leg into the contracts and we want to. But it depends on the location, right? Like, for example, the Aitken Creek contract, I think we took about half of that and have it under a 10-year contract. So it just depends on the situation, and it's worked extraordinarily well.

I'm glad you raised the storage question because we got 600 Bs or so across North America, all with great optionality outside the regulated piece. But we're adding just the announcements in the last 12 months, 10% to that number. So it's a big uptick for us at the right time in the market, and I feel very good, as Cynthia says, the way we'll leg into this.

Praneeth Satish: And then I'm sure you saw that Plains recently announced the acquisition of the remaining interest in the EPIC Crude pipeline. They've talked about potentially expanding the pipeline, may or may not do it. But if they do, it seems like it could be a positive for your Ingleside assets. So just curious if you have any thoughts on that deal or just the overall landscape now at Corpus and the puts and takes for your Ingleside and Gray Oak assets.

Colin Gruending: Yes, it's Colin here. Yes, and we've observed that, obviously. And we're partners with Plains on Cactus II already. I'm sure there's more work we can do together to the spirit of the question a couple of minutes ago on teaming up. Our franchise is remains a work in progress, but it's still really a good one. Ingleside is the #1 export terminal on the continent. It's poised to grow all the advantages it has, Gray Oak. It's great. So we're pretty confident with our system there and hopefully can do even more with Plains going forward.

Operator: And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Rebecca Morley for closing remarks.

Ohio’s energy bill HB15, which passed in May, was stripped of several pro-solar provisions, including a community solar program.
This program would have helped poor communities access solar energy.
Unlike solar and wind energy, methane is a climate changing gas itself, and when burned, produces carbon dioxide, another climate changing gas.
Taxpayers will foot the bills for the environmental, economic and health costs from Ohio’s refusal to embrace the real clean, green renewable energy sources: Solar and wind.","Unlike our neighboring states of Michigan and Illinois, Ohio’s politicians have not embraced the economic and environmental benefits that solar and wind energy provide. Instead, Ohio’s politicians passed Senate Bill SB52, where communities can effectively block solar and wind projects; something that communities cannot do when it comes to fossil fuel development. Ohio’s energy bill HB15, which passed in May, was stripped of several pro-solar provisions, including a community solar program.

This program would have helped poor communities access solar energy. During the past nine months, the Trump administration has mounted a blatant attack on renewable energy by rolling back environmental laws and policies favoring renewables, canceling incentives enacted in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act and halting projects even when in construction.

Just when you think you’ve heard it all, Ohio’s Republican politicians have, yet again, come up with another way to kill renewable energy projects, solar and wind and promote the non-renewable fossil fuel gas: Methane. HB 294 would grant clean energy status to methane gas.

This could mean gas projects might get preferential treatment over true renewable energy projects when it comes to permits granted by the Ohio Power Siting Board.

Unlike solar and wind energy, methane is a climate changing gas itself, and when burned, produces carbon dioxide, another climate changing gas. Sen. George Lang, one of the Republican co-sponsors, said in committee that natural gas is a cleaner energy source than coal.

That’s not saying much. Sen. Mark Romanchuk, a Richland County Republican and co-sponsor, remarked that building the infrastructure needed for solar and wind produced emissions, but he conveniently failed to mention the emissions created to construct a well pad and all the infrastructure needed to support the process, along with the resulting carbon dioxide emissions from combustion.

According to a report by the World Nuclear Association, comparison of life-cycle CO2 emissions from all energy sources shows that fracked gas produces the third highest amount of CO2, with 490 grams of CO2 per kW hour. Utility scale solar produces 48 grams, residential solar produces 41 and wind (offshore and land) are the lowest life-cycle emitters, at 11 grams per kW hr. The life-cycle emissions from fracked gas include those produced from the extraction process, which includes the gas (drilling), well pad and road construction, petrochemicals used to frack, compression and transportation of gas to LNG facilities and export transportation out of the country.

Additionally, the fracking process requires enormous amounts of water and produces millions of gallons of toxic radioactive brine. Harrison County saw 853 million gallons of surface water withdrawn for fracking in 2023. That represents 78 percent of the total water usage in the county. Wind and solar energy have a significantly lower carbon and water footprint. Calling fracked gas “clean” is laughable.

At the same time Ohio politicians are wanting to declare fracked gas clean, they are working on legislation (HB 170 and SB 136) to give the Ohio Department of Natural Resources primacy over carbon dioxide capture and sequestration Class VI wells. If passed, millions of tons of carbon emissions, including those from combusting that so-called clean methane gas, will be injected underneath Ohio land. Taxpayers will be paying the tax incentives of $85 per ton of industrial CO2 captured and stored, according to the One Big Beautiful Bill passed this summer.

Both HB 170 and SB 136 tramp on private property rights by allowing forced pooling, which means that land owners could be forced into allowing the injection of carbon dioxide, a dangerous asphyxiant, under their private property. Texas landowners are finding that sequestering CO2 in the pore space of geologic formations poses an interesting legal issue regarding pore space ownership. This issue is consequential because the plume from CO2 storage operations can travel miles from the injection site through the pore spaces.

The next assault on property owners may be the construction of pipelines to carry carbon dioxide across the state from industrial facilities to the injection wells; planned for Carroll, Jefferson, and Harrison counties. (see Herald-Star, Oct. 22.) Midwestern states have already seen significant pushbacks from land owners who are being forced to allow pipelines to cross their farms and communities through the use of eminent domain. Iowa residents have been fighting Summit Carbon Solutions’ pipeline for several years. In addition, Summit Carbon Solutions planned route through South Dakota to North Dakota has been blocked, as the company was banned from using eminent domain to take property. Will Ohio’s citizens be dealing with this legal battle as Ohio politicians invite the CCS industry into the state?

Recently, S. 2975, the federal Pipeline Safety Act of 2025, passed by voice vote. It is a bipartisan effort to reauthorize the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration’s safety programs until 2030. This law would set regulations for carbon dioxide pipelines. Environmental groups worry that the industry has had too much influence on these regs and point out the deficiencies that could lead to another accident like the one that occurred in 2020 in Satartia, Miss., where 45 people were overcome by CO2 leaking from a ruptured pipeline.

These concerns included: Lack of odorization of CO2 so releases are detectable by smell; performance-based leak detection and rupture mitigation; contaminant controls to help prevent CO2 related corrosion; and prevention of the conversion of oil or gas pipelines to CO2 pipelines.

Taxpayers will foot the bills for the environmental, economic and health costs from Ohio’s refusal to embrace the real clean, green renewable energy sources: Solar and wind. The U.S. Energy Association has said, “Wind and solar power are two of the fastest-growing energy sectors in the U.S. and produced as much as 17 percent of the country’s electricity last year.” Yet, Ohio politicians continue to push dirty fracked gas down our throats. They are either willfully ignorant or out of touch with reality.

Trustees Monday tabled a resolution concerning the five-year Chautauqua Lake Management plan that was proposed and developed by Dr. Robert Richardson of North Carolina State University. In January trustees voted 3-2 to not support or adopt a long-term plan for the submersed aquatic vegetation in Chautauqua Lake.

“I know we reviewed this in the past, and you’re asking us to reconsider, and I just haven’t had time to sit down,” Troche said. “I want to reread the plan and do some research. So I can’t vote for this yet, because I don’t know yet. I would like to postpone until the next meeting, personally, because I can’t vote for it as of now.”

Trustees are scheduled to meet Dec. 8.Trustee Ellen Barnes said the plan is an adaptable plan.

“Doctor Rob Richardson is world renowned for his work with lakes. We’re actually, I think, very fortunate to have him. And if you’ve ever heard him speak, or if you get a chance, it’s well worth listening to him,” Barnes said.

Barnes added that after what she called “horrendous conditions” of the lake, some officials have started rethinking and have decided to take the five-year plan of the shelf.

In a letter to New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Region Nine Director Julie Barrett O’Neill, and Pierre Chagnon, president of the Chautauqua Lake and Watershed Management Alliance, Mayor Randy Holcomb on behalf of the trustees and village residents is in support of the plan.

During the meeting Barnes read the letter aloud.

“Despite our collective efforts, we have had continuous problems with attempting to control the weeds and harmful algal blooms in our lake, which have made our lake less usable. The plan provides a path that will help control these issues in the future; a qualified Lake manager is an essential part of the plan. We need to address the weed and HAB problems to ensure the safety of everyone who uses the lake and for the economic security of our towns, villages and county.”

Barnes noted that a copy of the letter also will be sent to Gov. Kathy Hochul, and to the head of the DEC in Albany.

NC State’s Aquatic Plant Management Program has completed full lake surveys of Chautauqua Lake each year since 2020 that include collecting and analyzing hydroacoustic and point intercept data annually at up to 1,000 sites throughout the lake and documenting the presence and extent of aquatic plant species during the fall and spring seasons.

NC State’s Aquatic Plant Management Program officials propose a staged plan that deals with the entire lake rather than the 2017 Chautauqua Lake Macrophyte Management Strategy’s approach that divides the lake into subsections based off of shoreline use and the need to balance human interaction with environmental considerations.

University officials said the approach is good for small areas but shifts lake management strategies away from a focus on plant ecology to meet the county’s goals in managing vegetation in the lake.

At a January Mayville Village Board meeting, Mayor Rick Syper told a representative with the Chautauqua Lake Property Owners Association that the village would not be supporting the Long Term Management Plan for Submersed Aquatic Vegetation at Chautauqua Lake developed by the aquatic ecosystem team at NC State University. Only the town of Ellery has expressed support for the plan.",https://ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.post-journal.com/images/2025/11/26134047/LWVB-11-24-25-717x500.jpeg,N,,2025-11-28 10:05:06.681238

Project will protect Ontario workers and secure province’s place as a global energy superpower

PICKERING – Today, Minister Stephen Lecce announced the Ontario government has approved Ontario Power Generation’s (OPG) plan to refurbish four CANDU nuclear reactors at the Pickering Nuclear Generating Station. To support the government’s plan to protect Ontario workers and the province’s long-term energy security, the refurbishment will extend the facility’s operations to deliver affordable, reliable and clean power for up to 38 years. This will allow Ontario to continue leveraging its nuclear advantage to create more export opportunities, support good-paying jobs and build a more competitive, resilient and self-reliant economy in the face of U.S. tariffs.

“For more than 50 years, nuclear power has been the backbone of Ontario’s energy grid, with the Pickering Nuclear Generating Station as one of the best-performing and continuously operating nuclear stations in the world,” said Stephen Lecce, Minister of Energy and Mines. “To deliver on our major jobs plan to get Canadians working, extending the life of the facility will create jobs for tens of thousands of skilled workers while we build up the Ontario supply chain and keep 90 per cent of our project spend in this country. After the previous government’s attempt to shut down the facility, this refurbishment signals that we are doubling down on Canadian technology, Canadian workers and the Canadian supply chain to protect our economy from global instability.”

Pending final licensing approvals from the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC), OPG will begin the Project Execution Phase to refurbish Pickering “B” units 5 to 8 in early 2027, with completion expected by the mid-2030s. Once completed, Pickering will generate an increased capacity of up to 2,200 megawatts (MW) of electricity, equivalent to powering 2.2 million homes. This will ensure Ontario has the energy it needs to power more homes and a strong, self-reliant and resilient economy.

The project is expected to create approximately 30,500 jobs during refurbishment, while sustaining 6,700 jobs throughout the station’s operation. With a final budget of $26.8 billion, more than 90 per cent of the project cost will be spent in Canada to support local businesses and deliver economic benefits across the province. Refurbishment and ongoing operation will increase Canada’s GDP by $41.6 billion. OPG will deliver the project using the same disciplined planning, oversight, and partnership model that has kept the Darlington refurbishment on-time and on-budget. OPG has also committed to investing $100 million with Indigenous-owned companies over the life of the refurbishment project, ensuring that First Nations hosting nuclear facilities share directly in the economic benefits.

The Pickering “B” refurbishment is also expected to secure a long-term supply of Cobalt-60, a life-saving medical isotope used worldwide in cancer treatments and in the sterilization of medical equipment and food products, while supporting the government’s work to double the number of medical isotopes produced in the province over the next four years.

“Our government’s investment in the Pickering Nuclear Generating Station is key to strengthening our economy and standing as a leader in energy production,” said Peter Bethlenfalvy, Member of Provincial Parliament, Pickering-Uxbridge. “We are refurbishing infrastructure and creating more well-paying jobs for residents in Pickering and across Durham Region.”

Refurbishing Ontario’s nuclear fleet is a key pillar of Energy for Generations, the province’s first-ever integrated energy plan to ensure Ontario has the reliable, affordable power it needs to power new homes and drive economic growth. The government’s integrated approach and record investments in energy infrastructure are also providing the certainty needed for Indigenous communities, municipalities, businesses and industry partners to invest confidently in Ontario’s future. With a clear path forward, the plan is not only meeting the demands of today, but it is protecting jobs, supporting workers and powering economic growth for generations to come.

Now, after FDEP received public feedback on the plans, electric trucks are on the list.
“Electric transportation stakeholders were clear in our comments: not including electric vehicles as eligible for Volkswagen settlement funding amounted to government meddling in the free market,” Cross said.
“Only electric vehicles zero out tailpipe emissions.
The state plans to wrap up the fund by 2027.","After initially excluding them, the state now includes electric trucks in Florida’s plans for about $48 million specifically meant for projects to reduce harmful emissions. Public feedback prompted the Florida Department of Environmental Protection to revise its initial plans for how to spend the money.

RELATED: Millions of dollars for “cleaner technology” shouldn’t go to electric vehicles, says Florida proposal

The $48 million is from the state’s share of so-called Volkswagen funds, paid by the car company into a mitigation trust fund after allegedly violating the Clean Air Act by selling “trick” vehicles designed to cheat federal emissions tests. States received payouts from the mitigation fund based on how many “trick” vehicles were registered in each state, according to the EPA.

Florida’s total share was $166 million. So far, most of it has gone to electric bus projects. With the state’s remaining roughly $48 million, FDEP wants to help public and private fleet operators upgrade to lower-emission freight trucks.

But up until recently, FDEP’s plans didn’t include electric trucks in the list of lower-emission options eligible for the funds. Now, after FDEP received public feedback on the plans, electric trucks are on the list.

Stan Cross is director of electric transportation for the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, one of several electrification stakeholder groups that urged FDEP to revise its plans. He said he’s happy to see EV eligibility preserved.

“Electric transportation stakeholders were clear in our comments: not including electric vehicles as eligible for Volkswagen settlement funding amounted to government meddling in the free market,” Cross said. “Now that EVs are eligible, public and private fleet operators can choose the alternative fuel technology that best suits their needs.”

Along with electric trucks, FDEP’s plans also list trucks powered by “new diesel,” compressed natural gas and propane as eligible, lower-emission upgrade options for fleets. Cross said EVs are the best option.

“Only electric vehicles zero out tailpipe emissions. All the other alternative fuels still pollute,” Cross said. “EVs are also the most affordable vehicles in the long term, because electricity is the cheapest transportation fuel and EVs have the lowest maintenance costs.

“So an EV might be the best tool for the job, and having EVs eligible for the funding empowers fleet operators to make that decision.”

Fleet operators of vehicles used in community service, disaster management and emergency response functions will get funding priority, according to FDEP.

RELATED: Florida makes millions available for lower-emission garbage trucks

To date, nearly 70% of Florida’s Volkswagen funds have gone to electric school bus and transit bus projects, and just under 8% to electric vehicle charging infrastructure (EVCI) projects. Neither category will be funded with the state’s remaining $48 million, according to FDEP’s finalized plans.

Some of the public comments submitted to FDEP urged the state to continue to use Volkswagen funds to support electric bus and EV-charging projects. But FDEP “determined that it is in the interest of the state, the public, and the intended beneficiaries of the Volkswagen Settlement” not to do so.

Projects previously funded in both categories — electric buses and EV charging infrastructure — proved to be more lengthy and expensive than initially anticipated, according to FDEP. There were “long lead times needed to purchase eligible electric buses that meet fleet operators’ needs.” And for EV charging sites, some projects weren’t finished until more than three years after the date of the grant award to complete.

As of October, there are more than 4,000 EV-charging stations in Florida, including 42 EVCI projects funded by money from the Volkswagen settlement.

“We would have liked to see funding still made available for charging infrastructure, but are happy to see that electric vehicle eligibility is preserved,” Cross said. “Getting vehicles on the road that are driving on affordable and clean electricity is important and should be a top priority for the state.”

Compared to other states in the Southeast, Florida ranks first for EV sales, according to SACE’s latest annual report.

In August, FDEP’s draft plans estimated the state had nearly $41 million of Volkswagen funds left to spend. Between the state’s remaining project funds and interest accrued on those funds, Florida’s actual remaining balance is more than $48 million, according to the state’s new, finalized plans.

Florida has been slower than many other states to spend its Volkswagen dollars, according to energy industry members.

The oil and gas rig count, an early indicator of future output, fell by 10 to 544 in the week to November 26, the lowest since September.

Baker Hughes, which usually releases its North American rig count on Friday, issued this report a couple of days early due to the U.S. Thanksgiving Day holiday on Thursday.

Baker Hughes said oil rigs fell by 12 to 407 this week, their lowest since September 2021, while gas rigs rose by 3 to 130, their highest since July 2023.

In Texas, the biggest oil and gas producing state, the rig count fell by eight to 226, the lowest since July 2021.

The oil and gas rig count declined by about 5% in 2024 and 20% in 2023 as lower U.S. oil CL1! and gas NG1! prices over the past couple of years prompted energy firms to focus more on boosting shareholder returns and paying down debt rather than increasing output.

Even though analysts forecast U.S. spot crude prices would decline for a third year in a row in 2025, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projected crude output would rise from a record 13.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2024 to around 13.6 million bpd in 2025.

On the gas side, EIA projected a 58% increase in spot gas prices in 2025 would prompt producers to boost drilling activity this year after a 14% price drop in 2024 caused several energy firms to cut output for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic reduced demand for the fuel in 2020.",,N,,2025-11-28 12:01:11.240319

Leroy Conish, 69, owns and operates a farm in Vacherie, downriver from St. Gabriel in St. James Parish.
The St. Gabriel city council voted unanimously against the proposed expansion in April 2017.
Marylee Orr, founder and executive director of LEAN, has worked with St. Gabriel residents to advocate for cleaner air since the 1980s.
In 2023, LEAN installed air quality monitors along the Mississippi River, but was unable to do so in St. Gabriel.","The city of St. Gabriel has zero major fast food chain restaurants, pharmacies or laundromats. But there are nearly a dozen chemical facilities within city limits and at least 30 within a 10 mile radius.

“We have bad smells here at night,” said Reginald Grace, 72, a retired counselor and lifelong resident. “Like a rotten egg, like chlorine.”

The air on a regular day in St. Gabriel is acrid — but many residents seem not to notice anymore. Grace has spent the last 10 years organizing residents against the growing chemical industry. The city is located in Louisiana’s infamous “Cancer Alley” — an 85-mile stretch of land between Baton Rouge and New Orleans home to over 200 industrial facilities along the Mississippi River, where the risk of cancer from industrial air pollution is the highest in the nation.

In the past few years, Grace said several of his neighbors have been diagnosed with or died of cancer. His wife of 41 years, Rhonda, had breast cancer, ovarian cancer and leukemia, which she died of in 2023, despite having no known family history of any of the three, Grace said. He added that he is in remission from prostate cancer.

St. Gabriel is home to the Syngenta agrochemical facility, which repackages a popular but highly toxic farming pesticide known as paraquat under the brand name Gramoxone before it is distributed to other states. The plant is owned by the Chinese company SinoChem Holdings Ltd.

A report released in October by Coming Clean, Alianza Nacional de Campesinas and Pesticide Action and Agroecology Network warned of the dangers of paraquat exposure. Banned in over 70 countries, it remains one of the most commonly used chemicals by farmers in the United States for weed management — with the largest point of entry in the last eight years being the Port of New Orleans, according to Jim Vallete, a contributing researcher to the report.

The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warns that inhaling paraquat can cause lung damage. Some research shows that exposure to the chemical is associated with Parkinson’s disease, including a 2020 Louisiana State University study that concluded there was a greater risk of the disease in areas where pesticides, including paraquat, were used. There is currently litigation in Illinois federal court involving over 5,000 people suing Syngenta for alleged development of Parkinson’s from exposure to paraquat.

An Environmental Protection Agency memo from 2017 noted that the chemical is so toxic that “one sip can kill.” The same memo said even minimal contact can cause serious injury to the eyes and skin.

The paraquat report includes several statements from farm workers across the country who have allegedly suffered harmful health impacts from exposure to the pesticide. Paraquat has also been linked to cancer and childhood leukemia, the report finds. From production to distribution to application, the report concludes that factory workers, port workers and farm laborers are all at risk of unsafe exposure.

Syngenta declined Verite News’ request to comment on its factory’s health and environmental safety regulations as well as the use of paraquat in Louisiana farming. The facility’s parent company’s home country, China, banned the domestic use of paraquat in 2016.

Human Rights Watch reported last year that Cancer Alley residents commonly suffer from respiratory issues, including asthma, chronic coughs and sinus infections. Migraines, miscarriages and dementia are also common complaints among St. Gabriel residents, according to Grace.

He added that he and other local activists — many of whom said they appreciate the close-knit community, childhood memories and laidback feel of the town — are not asking for all of the plants to close down. They just want stricter monitoring of the impact on the environment.

“I’m not advocating cutting the plants out,” Grace said. “I know they’ve invested a lot of money into it, but what are you going to do, put money over safety?”

Ongoing debate on chemical safety

St. Gabriel incorporated as a city in 1994 partially to have more of a say against the growing chemical industry. The population decreased from a peak of 7,500 in 2020 but is once again growing as of 2022 according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Grace said the area has become popular with retirees from Baton Rouge looking for peace and quiet. Today, the population of roughly 6,800 must travel to the neighboring cities of Baton Rouge or Gonzales for jobs and many basic necessities such as medical care and fresh groceries.

“There’s nothing in this community. It’s a city, but there are no amenities,” Grace said. “People who grew up here, the children, don’t stay.”

Following the publication of the paraquat report last month, Verite News reporters visited St. Gabriel and the surrounding area to speak with residents about their ongoing efforts to minimize the harmful effects of living in an industrial hotspot.

Leroy Conish, 69, owns and operates a farm in Vacherie, downriver from St. Gabriel in St. James Parish. He’s aware that his farm is located in Cancer Alley and said he’s never used a product containing paraquat and aims to gradually eliminate the use of synthetic chemicals on his fields.

“We don’t really need to have the amount of chemicals that we use, because we can go back to farming the way our grandfathers and great-grandfathers used to farm,” Conish said.

Of the 10 acres Conish currently farms, roughly one acre contains no chemicals at all. Conish said once he learns how to make his model cost-effective, he wants to help bring about a farming revolution that helps low-income families in the area learn to sustain themselves in a healthy way.

Conish grows plenty of okra, which he said has antioxidants that he believes fight cancer — especially important “being in an environment that is filled with cancer emissions coming from every direction,” he said. Medical research has yet to conclusively prove that antioxidants do prevent cancer.

Many of Cancer Alley’s chemical plants are located in or near poor and mostly Black neighborhoods. As a Black farmer, Conish added that he believes chemical plants in the area take advantage of the region’s poverty. He wants to see greater regulation of the plants.

“Chronic poverty is a vestige of slavery,” he said. “Without chronic poverty, they wouldn’t have the opportunity to take advantage of poor people and promise them jobs, and I use the word ‘promise’ loosely.”

In a statement to Verite News, David Cresson, president and CEO of the Louisiana Chemical Association, called paraquat “a vital chemical to our farmers.”

“Farmers around the world have moved to adopt no-till farming, but this is only possible because herbicides like paraquat are used to control weeds while keeping soil undisturbed,” Cresson wrote. “It remains a widely utilized herbicide due to its fast-acting control of resistant weeds, compatibility with conservation tillage, and lack of residual soil activity.”

Herbicides are a type of pesticide that target weeds and unwanted vegetation.

Cresson added that U.S. regulatory agencies have reviewed scientific studies on the links between paraquat use and Parkinson’s disease and have not found a causal relationship. He did not address why 70 countries have banned the pesticide for health and safety reasons.

Navigating a shared space

Jan Drinkwater, 77, moved to East Iberville, just outside of St. Gabriel, more than 40 years ago. A breast cancer survivor, she said she was not informed of the air pollution in the area beforehand and wishes the agrochemical industry was better regulated.

“We have terrible odors from time to time,” she said. “This is current and frequent. … Why can’t they put that on the news?”

Drinkwater said as a resident, she should be made aware of what she is breathing. She added that despite the health risks, she still enjoys many enrichment activities at the St. Gabriel senior center and does not mind the lack of businesses in the city.

“I didn’t really move here for restaurants,” she said. “I wish it could remain rural … I would never want to go anywhere else.”

Melvin Craige, 75, has known Grace since childhood. Previously the director of St. Gabriel’s community center, Craige said he’s seen how the chemical industry contributes to the community by making investments such as refurbishing the community center’s weight room.

“When I was a director, they did all of the equipment and everything in the community center. They did a heck of a lot of programming,” he said.

YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.

But Craige said he is also aware of scientific research pointing to links between the industry and medical problems facing residents.

“We just buried one of my cousins here Saturday who died of cancer,” he said.

Craige said he would like to see the community and the industry cooperate even more to monitor emissions to ensure better health conditions for the people of St. Gabriel.

One forum that the community and the industrial sector use to communicate on employment opportunities, safety and environmental concerns and industry expansion is the local community advisory panel. The East Iberville Community Advisory Panel has existed since at least the 1990s, and it currently meets every other month on Syngenta property, according to advisory panel members who spoke with Verite News.

Alex Robertson, 56, who has lived in St. Gabriel since his childhood, has been attending the panel’s meetings for about a year.

“We always sit back and complain, and we say what somebody is not doing, but the question is, ‘What are you doing?’” Robertson asked.

Robertson said he worked at the Koura plant in St. Gabriel for 30 years. Now retired, he remains a youth pastor at the Iberville Christian Center. He said his professional success is a testament to the industry providing well-paying jobs. He also said chemicals produced in the city contribute to everyday products Americans use to make their lives better.

But a recent Tulane University study showed Black Louisiana residents live in areas most affected by industrial pollution, yet make up the smallest portion of the industry’s workforce. Iberville Parish, where St. Gabriel is located, was shown to be home to the third largest share of the highest-paying manufacturing jobs in the state — but people of color were underrepresented among these positions.

Robertson joins the advisory panel’s meetings as a volunteer and liaises with the St. Gabriel City Council at public meetings on matters pertaining to the industry. He said he believes in the importance of the industry being a “good steward” to the community, by providing more high-paying jobs to local residents and offering educational opportunities — such as having plant engineers tutor kids at the local schools.

Good stewards should also not pollute the city, he said, and if they do, they should be upfront about it with the community.

‘The fight is not over with’

In addition to helping lead Citizens for a Better St. Gabriel, a local advocacy group, Grace sits on the board of the Louisiana Environmental Action Network (LEAN), an environmental not-for-profit.

Grace said one of his biggest wins against the chemical industry was in 2017, when he and Citizens for a Better St. Gabriel members successfully fought against Adsorbent Solutions, a local carbon reactivation plant that had sought to expand its operations.

“We told the council, if y’all do this, you’re killing your own people,” Grace said.

The St. Gabriel city council voted unanimously against the proposed expansion in April 2017. Adsorbent Solutions closed down its facility shortly after the vote.

Marylee Orr, founder and executive director of LEAN, has worked with St. Gabriel residents to advocate for cleaner air since the 1980s. In 2023, LEAN installed air quality monitors along the Mississippi River, but was unable to do so in St. Gabriel.

“We tried, we waited, we went through all the right authorities,” she said. “But the experience with St. Gabriel was that the public entities did not want the stationary monitor on their property.”

Orr said LEAN plans to expand the air monitoring project and has not given up on installing sensors in St. Gabriel.

Lionel Johnson has been St. Gabriel’s mayor since 2011. Despite multiple requests, he did not schedule an interview to talk about public health, the economy and the proliferation of chemical facilities.

“He’s a coward,” Grace said. “He doesn’t mix well with people, but he’s highly educated, and he talks at people instead of talking to them.”

Grace’s son Kyle ran against Johnson in the last mayoral election in 2023, losing by only a slim margin. Kyle Grace’s platform centered on bringing more businesses to St. Gabriel, while Johnson focused on expanding city services.

Reginald Grace said he finds that much of the city has become “complacent” to the harmful health effects of the chemical industry.

“A lot of people are not educated to the fact that they can demand more,” he said. “They’re just trying to live from day to day.”

Grace said despite the health risks, he has remained in St. Gabriel all these years because of his family’s ties to the area and the difficulties of starting over somewhere new.

“I hope I live a few more good years,” he said. “Whatever damage has been done, it’s been done.”

Although the chemical industry has only grown in St. Gabriel, Grace said he urges the younger generation not to pack up and leave or cease their advocacy efforts.

“We’re trying to help the young people understand they have to get involved, they have to be educated and they have to work toward self-improvement,” he said. “The fight is not over with.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC_7250-copy-2048x1367-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 09:03:03.911577

The Japan Organisation for Metals and Energy Security has established the special purpose company, HJ Platinum Metals, to hold and fund their future equity interests in the Waterberg project.","JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – Platinum is already very well embedded as an indispensable catalyst in the hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) technology that very impressively powered the Toyotas that chauffeured delegates during last week’s B20 and G20 global summits in Johannesburg.

Now, the precious metal that South Africa hosts in greater abundance than any other country on earth could also find that its remarkable catalytic qualities are utilised by battery electric vehicles (BEVs) as well.

This is because platinum group metals (PGMs) have been found by Florida International University to be able to extend the life of lithium-sulphur batteries for the betterment of not only sustainable mobility but also for renewable-energy storage, and to have potential to be a significant efficiency and sustainability boost for electricity grids as well.

New York- and Toronto-listed Platinum Group Metals Limited reiterates this in its latest 2025 annual results, in which the Canada-based company makes clear that it is continuing to advance the use of PGMs in lithium battery technologies by way of Lion Battery Technologies, which is highlighting the benefits that PGMs can bring to the lithium battery space.

Interestingly, Platinum Group Metals Limited spelt out in a media release to Mining Weekly that it is also continuing to take the Waterberg project on the northern limb of South Africa’s PGM-rich Bushveld Complex in Limpopo province towards a development and construction decision.

While this is underway, the company, headed by CEO Frank Hallam, is continuing to collaborate with an affiliate of South Africa’s Johannesburg Stock Exchange-listed Valterra Platinum and Florida International University to take PGMs to the next level. Valterra, it should be noted, is the company that last week chauffeured B20 and G20 delegates around Johannesburg in Toyota Mirai cars, which are FCEVs.

Valterra led a mine-to-market FCEV display, which involved South Africa's Sasol providing the hydrogen, Air Products dispensing the hydrogen, Bambili Energy providing the South Africa-manufactured membrane electrode assemblies for the fuel cells, and Bosch, providing the fuel cells.

On top of this, it is envisaged that the use of PGMs in BEVs will be achieved by allowing the catalytic contribution of PGMs to extend the life of lithium-sulphur batteries significantly, through the addition of nanoparticles of platinum to the sulphur side of the battery so that the tiny particles can work at molecular scale to ensure a cleaner, greener and healthier tomorrow.

This comes against the background of diversified demand for PGMs having already extended well beyond the automotive, jewellery, investment, and hydrogen sectors into the fibreglass, semiconductor, health and even food preservation sectors in what many see as “only the beginning”.

Interestingly, research and development by Florida International University is repeatedly pointing to the lighter weight and higher energy density of lithium-sulphur batteries as important competitive advantages engendered by PGMs.

“The unique properties of PGMs as powerful catalysts are being applied to various technologies as possible solutions for more efficient energy generation and storage, which may create new demand for PGMs.

“The company's battery technology initiative through Lion with partner Valterra represents one such new opportunity in the high-profile lithium battery research and innovation field,” Platinum Group Metals Limited stated, while also pointing out that the investment is creating a vertical integration with a broader industrial market development strategy to bring new PGM-using technologies to market.

Lion’s reiterated target is to develop batteries with specific energies that are 20% to 100% higher than current technologies while meeting or exceeding their present cycle lives though the unlocking of chemistries for use in BEVs.

As reported by Mining Weekly, Lion has engaged the Battery Innovation Center in Newberry, Indiana, to help accelerate commercialisation efforts for its next-generation PGM-enhanced battery chemistries.

The Battery Innovation Center’s scope of work is to conduct independent small- and large-scale trials to validate Lion’s proprietary PGM-based electrode composition, slurry, and films in lithium sulphur cells.

There is little doubt that PGMs will provide BEVs with additional kilowatt hours per kilogram. Catalysts based on PGM nanoparticles offer a potentially rapid solution to many of the current battery problems and have been shown to improve the performance of the batteries.

WATERBERG PROJECT

The Waterberg project is being planned as a mechanised, shallow, decline access palladium, platinum, gold and rhodium, or four-element, mine. Platinum Group Metals Limited is the operator of the project, as directed by a technical committee also including representatives from joint venture partners Implats, Mnombo, and HJ Platinum Metals. The Japan Organisation for Metals and Energy Security has established the special purpose company, HJ Platinum Metals, to hold and fund their future equity interests in the Waterberg project.

Being assessed are commercial alternatives for mine development financing and concentrate offtake.

As a part of the investigation of smelting and base metal refining options, discussions with all South African integrated producers, including Implats, are taking place, with a view to negotiating formal concentrate offtake arrangements.

To date no terms have been agreed and as an alternative, the possible establishment of smelting and base metal refining facilities in either Saudi Arabia or South Africa is still being studied.

“Before any processing of materials in Saudi Arabia could occur, South African government authorisation for the export of concentrate or matte would be required,” the company restated in the latest report.

In September, the board approved a sixth stage of work in the amount of R92.1-million for fiscal year 2026 to allow for the continuation of work programmes underway.

The interim budget, which covers the period to the end of August next year, includes components of a $21-million pre-construction work programme approved in principle for the Waterberg project.

During the fiscal year to August 31, a net loss of $4.54-million was incurred. General and administrative expenses during the period were $3.66-million. Share based compensation was $1.19-million. The foreign exchange gain recognised in the current period was $95 000, well up on last year’s $4 000 owing mainly to the US dollar increasing in value over the Canadian dollar during the financial year.",https://cdn.creamermedia.com/assets/articles/images/resized/0001241809_resized_platinummesh21022.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 08:03:11.443272

On a warm day in the spring, when you look at a bright flower and see a bee dancing around on the inside of the plant, that creature is likely just making a stop on a long journey before it returns to its home — its hive. But odds are, that hive might not be the structure in a tree you are thinking of. It very well might just be the result of someone’s hard work right in their backyard.

Apiculture — the technical term for beekeeping — is a major industry across the state of North Carolina. Many counties — over 80 out of the 100 in North Carolina — and the state as a whole, have their own beekeeping associations.

The North Carolina State Beekeeping Association has over 4,000 active members across the state, making it the largest organized association for beekeepers in the country. And North Carolina, in general, has somewhere close to 15,000 beekeepers — whether it be a person growing a new hobby, an individual understanding the science behind the craft or someone attempting to make a living out of the process — according to North Carolina State University.

Because of the multitude of motivations behind beekeeping, NCSU even has an extensive apiculture program to further the understanding of honey bee biology and to improve bee management.

Jennifer Keller, research specialist and apiculture technician at NCSU, said there are still a lot of mysteries surrounding beekeeping — like why some colonies excel in their lifespan more than others — that scientists are still trying to understand in their research. However, Keller and her colleagues see the clear necessity of honey bees in our world.

“Honey bees, as well as other native bees, are very important for pollinating to produce good crops, and even some of the crops that are not dependent on bees will have an added benefit from the pollination of bees,” she said. “If there are no honey bees around, they may still produce a crop, but with honey bees, they’ll produce more of that same crop, so that’s better for farmers. Without bees, things wouldn’t be as good — there’s some crops that are dependent on bees that just would not be able to happen as much.”

The importance of honey bees, as well as the niche interest of the craft, is part of why thousands of individuals across the state participate in beekeeping, whether as a hobby or a commercial business.

Beekeeping as a hobby

Lisa Vogel has always had a piece of bees in her life.

When she was a child growing up in the mountains of North Carolina, she remembers her dad — a self-proclaimed honey aficionado — bringing in different kinds of honey for her to try, from sour wood to whipped, all the result of a bee’s hard work.

Then, 10 years ago, out of pure curiosity, she visited the home of a friend who was a beekeeper to see her process.

“I was hooked immediately,” Vogel said. “It was like, I feel like I did this in another life or something. I mean, it was crazy. You know, when you find a hobby that you just instantly love? It was that feeling.”

Now, a decade later, Vogel cares for nine hives on the property of her home in Orange County, North Carolina. And whether she is harvesting the honey-filled frames from her hives or protecting her bees from the common risk of varroa mites, she has several tricks she has learned over the years.

Bee risk and tricks

Though a beekeeper should not constantly interfere with their hive, when the bees are at risk, the keeper might have to step in. One of the main risks facing bees right now is the presence of varroa mites, an external parasitic mite that attacks and feeds on honey bees.

While each beekeeper has a different method to protect their hive from this parasite, Vogel said that she checks for the issue once every five weeks during the warm months — which is often one of her only reasons for going into the hive at all.

After doing an inspection, if she finds a significant number of mites, Vogel will treat her hive with a mite medication or an alcohol wash. She said she learned this trick from a North Carolina beekeeper and apiary inspector, Lewis Cauble.

In addition to keeping her hive safe, Vogel has a trick for ensuring the queen bee is alive by looking for eggs on frames. Because while the whole hive is important, the queen has her title for a reason.

“If the queen dies, then the hive dies, possibly — especially if they don’t have any eggs to raise a new queen,” Vogel said. “If they don’t have a queen, they don’t have eggs, and they’re doomed.”

And if that were to occur, one would have to purchase a new queen from a beekeeping shop — like Bailey Bee Supply in Hillsborough — to maintain the integrity of a hive and reduce the risk of losing more bees. Thus, the maintenance of a hive is critical. Having the knowledge to do so is, too, which is why Justin Maness created his Durham-based company, Buddha Bee Apiary.

Maness’s business is built around the idea of him and his employees, like Claudia Roller, managing beehives in clients’ yards and educating individuals on proper practices.

“We just focus on the education and the experience of people getting the opportunity to come out and be in hives with us and see what it’s all about,” Roller said.

Roller studied chemistry at Goucher College in Maryland, and when she first started working for Maness, she had never even seen a hive in her life. But she was intrigued by the scientific aspect of apiculture, and over the past several years, she has become a beekeeper herself, inspecting hives and making sure the pollinators are cared for. She is now even interested in going to school to get a master’s degree in apiculture from somewhere like NCSU to further her knowledge and the research of beekeeping.

Buddha Bee does not sell any honey from their business, but rather focuses on that education aspect and growing the beekeeping industry, as a whole.

“We only harvest honey if the hive is able to handle us taking some,” Roller said. “And then we give it right back to the people who are hosting a hive. So if you have a hive in your backyard, you’re getting your honey right from your backyard.”

Honey production

But while Buddha Bee does not profit from its production, the sticky, sweet golden substance is a major aspect of beekeeping, and keepers like Vogel do share their hive’s product.

“I sell it at different places around Orange County,” she said. “This year I’ll be selling it mostly to friends, and I do a Holiday Market where I sell it as well.”

However, this venture is not about making money for Vogel; in fact, she said she does not make much of a profit at all, especially since she does not extract her own honey — which is a different process entirely.

Extraction is the process of separating honey from beeswax combs to harvest it for use. When Vogel needs this done, she takes her frames to an extractor in Mebane, North Carolina, before she bottles the product.

Vogel said she does not do extraction, not only because she does not have the equipment for it, but because, with her age, the process is too heavy a task for her. For Phil Crump, though, extraction is just another step in his beekeeping process as a whole.

Bees and the economy

Crump has been beekeeping for almost 50 years and, according to Vogel, is a salesman extraordinaire. He primarily sells honey at events through Plant Delights Nursery, a small business in Wake County, North Carolina, and begins the honey process from step one.

From suiting up in protective covering to having hands-on time with the buzzing creatures to harvesting the golden frames, Crump does it all. Then, when he finally reaches the extraction element, Crump has a honed-down method.

“You’re going to take your knife, and it saws, kind of, and you can see how I’m just taking those cappings off,” Crump said as he started the process. “And then I’m just going to go down, and I like to not damage the comb any more than necessary. Some people just get in there and they’ll start digging it. There’s another method that you can use that uses a hot knife and it melts the wax off. But I just think this is the least destructive method, and that’s what I like to do, is not to damage this any more than necessary, so that the bees can repair it or utilize it.”

The harvesting and extraction process allows Crump to produce a profit from selling products at events.

He said that he typically sells a bottle of honey for around $30, and while that might seem like a steep price, with the effort and time that has been put in, at the end of the day, that outcome makes sense and people will buy it.

“I can market my honey in a location where people are already coming to spend money,” Crump said. “They’re already anticipating buying something. This is a nursery that sells rare and unusual plants, so they’re not inexpensive plants. They’re not going to Lowe’s [Hardware]. So that’s a unique component. I can’t make money at the farmer’s market because people from Eastern North Carolina come and they’re selling their honey so cheap I can’t even compete.”

Crump said that the honey production business is hard, but what makes it harder is when these individuals sell their honey for a lower price than what other keepers see fit. This practice hurts people like Crump who try to support themselves through their sales. This way of selling and overharvesting can also create poor beekeeping practices.

Overharvesting occurs when beekeepers remove too much honey from a hive. This leads to colony collapse by depleting a hive’s food stores, forcing beekeepers to rely on supplemental feeding, which can add stress and is not a sustainable practice for the colony’s long-term health — which though is not especially common, it is something Crump tries to avoid entirely.

The community

But Crump said that beyond just the honey harvesting and business of beekeeping, the people make it what it is.

“My interest is honey production, but I’d say at least half of what interests me about beekeeping is the fellowship,” he said. “[I] really enjoy the people. It’s a great group of people. They’re real.”

Vogel said that many of the practices she has learned have been through personal research or from the greater beekeeping community, in general. It is this community that truly defines beekeeping in North Carolina.

And it is that community that has also grown Eva Walker’s interest in the craft, despite being a standout among her peers.

Walker is a senior at Durham Academy Upper School and has been a beekeeper for almost four years. She has a hive at her home in Durham that she maintains with her father, as well as one that she set up at her high school that she uses to help educate other students about beekeeping.

While she is not necessarily in the same age group as many other beekeepers in North Carolina, Walker has still formed various connections. She said that the community is so tight-knit across the state that everyone seems to know each other or is able to bond over this niche hobby.

“Being young, I’m sort of at an advantage, because people want to hear [about it],” she said. “There’s questions of like, ‘Wow, you’re so young, how’d you get into this?’”

So while the motivation behind beekeeping varies for each person — whether for education, a fun hobby, a profession or anything else — the root of the enjoyment of the craft lies in the community and the opportunity to protect, preserve and promote the lives of the creatures that keep nature so bright.

Stories from the UNC Media Hub are written by senior students from various concentrations in the Hussman School of Journalism and Media working together to find, produce and market unique stories — all designed to capture multiple angles and perspectives from across North Carolina.

The Oct. 22 Post and Courier article, ""Proposed SC Gas Plant's Pollution Could Affect 2 Million People,"" which referenced a Southern Environmental Law Center study produced by Harvard University researchers, was timed perfectly just before Halloween.

Like costumed characters at a haunted house, the study aimed to instill fear in South Carolinians. It was also an admonishment to any of us South Carolinians who have chosen to use natural gas or propane in our homes, stood around a burn barrel or a fireplace, grilled out, barbecued a hog, lit a brush pile, or cranked a tractor, truck or car.

Ironically, the Massachusetts-based researchers at Harvard have the third-highest electricity prices in the nation according to Choose Energy. Only California and Hawaii customers pay more. The same report said South Carolina has the country’s 18th-lowest electricity prices. South Carolina leadership balances affordability, economic development and environmental responsibility to protect the best interests of our customers and the energy future of our state.

A major indication of this leadership is the recent passage of the S.C. Energy Security Act. While it does authorize Santee Cooper to evaluate a jointly owned natural gas generation facility with Dominion Energy at Canadys Station – Dominion Energy’s former coal-fired generation site in Colleton County – the law’s overall intent is to advance an all-of-the-above energy strategy to benefit South Carolina.

For decades, environmentalists in South Carolina urged Dominion Energy to convert the coal-fired boilers at Canadys to natural gas. We are proposing a much more efficient and cleaner solution. With state-of-the-art environmental protections, the air-cooled, closed-cycle facility will be one of the most efficient generating plants in the Southeast. In fact, it will reduce water use by over 90% compared to traditional cooling systems. And, it will offer the best pairing for additional solar.

Although our combined solar capacity is greater than any single generating unit on either of our systems, non-dispatchable solar power is limited by variability in weather, particularly cloud cover and the natural progression of day into night. The following chart shows solar at its best and worst on two days here in South Carolina. Solar is unavailable as sunset approaches until after sunrise. Even if you doubled or tripled the amount of solar capacity, that would still be the case.

So why are we proposing to build a natural gas generating plant at Canadys?

Canadys provides the most efficient, dispatchable, flexible energy source to meet the future energy needs of South Carolina. As such, it will pair optimally with the sporadic, intermittent availability of solar energy and will accommodate the continued growth and development of non-dispatchable renewables.

Canadys has an established footprint. As a remediated site of a former coal generation plant, Canadys eliminates the need to acquire and clear large swaths of new land. It is also strategically positioned at the energy intersection of the Lowcountry of South Carolina, located in the immediate vicinity of well-established transmission corridors for Santee Cooper and Dominion Energy.

Canadys will support well-paying jobs in Colleton County and surrounding communities, help attract new industry and contribute to a substantial increase in needed property taxes for the benefit of citizens, students and infrastructure.

Additionally, pipeline provider Kinder Morgan, Santee Cooper, and Dominion Energy will work with the ACE Basin Task Force to create a wildlife corridor for participating landowners. This will complement the 420-acre Canadys environmental mitigation area adjacent to the Edisto River that has already been returned to its indigenous state with flora and fauna.

These facts alone clearly justify the Canadys project. However, the greatest source of energy for Santee Cooper and Dominion Energy emanates from our combined family of approximately 4,000 dedicated employees who live throughout South Carolina, including in the Lowcountry. We are your neighbors who are committed to providing the true power to collectively serve our beloved Palmetto State.","https://www.blufftontoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/22/NAUG/87420028007-keller-kissam-headshot.jpg?crop=2328,1310,x0,y116&width=2328&height=1310&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-28 08:02:48.270603

To remedy this perceived injustice, the secretary has proposed an audacious solution: the federal government seizing half of patent royalties for inventions it helps fund.

As a scientist at Louisiana State University — one whose federally funded work could soon save the cattle industry millions — I can assure him the return on investment is far from zero. Taxpayers benefit immensely from federally supported university science, not just in the form of life-enhancing products, but through high-paying jobs, economic prosperity and tax revenues.

More importantly, the process by which ideas born in the laboratory are transformed into useful products such as medicines, consumer electronics or Google. And this has worked extraordinarily well for decades.

Lutnick's proposal would lay waste to this system, leaving Louisiana's economy without one of its greatest sources of economic growth and job creation.

The system of technology commercialization that Lutnick has attacked was created four decades ago by a little-known law called the Bayh-Dole Act. The 1980 reform allows universities, like LSU, to patent discoveries made with federal support and license them to companies capable of turning them into products.

Before Bayh-Dole, Washington kept those patents and nearly all of them gathered dust. Out of some 28,000 federally-funded patents, fewer than 1,400 ever reached the private sector.

That changed with the Bayh-Dole Act. And today, academic tech transfer generates more than 25,000 invention disclosures and 9,000 licenses each year. Since 1996, it has driven $1 trillion in GDP and supported 6.5 million jobs nationwide.

I've seen the benefits of this process firsthand. My lab at LSU's School of Veterinary Medicine developed a vaccine against bovine respiratory disease, which kills millions of calves every year.

Using funding from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, we modified the bovine herpes virus to trigger immunity against multiple pathogens at once. The result could save up to 8 million calves each year and spare ranchers more than $1 billion in losses.

Thanks to the process Bayh-Dole made possible, LSU patented my discovery and licensed it to a startup in South Dakota willing to take on the costly task of testing and commercialization. Without that partnership, this vaccine would be sitting in a university lab freezer.

Louisiana's economy depends on precisely this kind of innovation. The state's cattle sector alone contributes more than $767 million each year. Breakthroughs developed here keep our farmers productive, our food supply stable and our universities competitive.

And my vaccine is just one example. In 2023, LSU secured 35 patents, placing the university in the top 100 nationwide. Recent patents include algae-based bioplastics that could strengthen Louisiana's green-manufacturing sector, a feral-hog toxicant to protect farms and a genetically-modified herpes virus that could treat cancer.

That's why I'm troubled by Secretary Lutnick's proposal. If Washington seizes half the royalties on university patents it helps fund, it would break the bridge between university research and private innovation.

Universities already spend months negotiating licensing agreements with private companies. Those talks are complex because schools and inventors must agree on how to divide future royalties. Bayh-Dole requires universities to share royalties with the inventor and reinvest back into the research cycle. At LSU, inventors receive 40% of royalties from their discoveries, and another 17% flows back to their departments, funding graduate stipends, new equipment and future research.

When licensing slows down, the entire innovation pipeline starts to break. Universities are willing to spend time and resources filing patents because they are hopeful they can recoup funds with royalties — many schools barely break even. But companies won't agree to license without patent protection. If fewer deals are signed, schools lose their incentive to patent discoveries. Projects that could create jobs in Baton Rouge or save crops in Lafayette might never get off the ground.

Supporters of the proposal claim the government could increase returns by taking royalties directly. The opposite is true. The taxes generated by products, companies and industries born under Bayh-Dole far exceed what any royalty grab could yield.

Phillip Stafford has been converted. After two years of driving a Tesla, he says there’s no going back to gasoline — the money he saves on fuel alone makes that clear. And since his work as a crisis counselor takes him all over Richmond, Virginia, he charges often.

That’s made him picky about where he buys electrons. On a crisp fall afternoon last month, Stafford had his Model 3 plugged in at a Sheetz. A red-and-white Wawa sandwich wrapper on the seat hinted at where his heart lies in that convenience-store rivalry. Still, brand loyalty goes only so far when the battery is running low. Given a choice between the two, Sheetz wins. ​“It has more watts, so it charges a little faster,” he said.

The seemingly small question of where to spend 20 or so minutes topping off a battery reveals the transformation taking hold among fuel retailers. For more than 50 years, chains like Wawa, Sheetz, and Love’s Travel Stops have defined when and where people refuel. As EVs reshape mobility, these retailers are among those embracing charging.

Their challenge goes beyond providing power to turning the time that drivers spend plugged in into profitable foot traffic. Selling electricity alone won’t pay the bills; the real money lies in selling snacks. Making that work requires reimagining what a pit stop looks and feels like, even as costly infrastructure upgrades and shifting federal policies complicate the transition.

Wawa and Sheetz are two of the furthest along. The Pennsylvania-based companies have built out hundreds of chargers and enjoy fervent fanbases that make them two of the most popular convenience stores in the country. Their made-to-order sandwiches, vast array of snacks, and clean restrooms have made them regular stops for road trippers and commuters alike — and now, for EV drivers looking to recharge their cars and, often, themselves.

They offer a glimpse of the road ahead. As electric vehicles move ever further from niche toward norm, the focus for retailers like these could shift from which one offers the cheapest fuel to which one can make waiting for the car to fill up the best experience.

“The problem with a lot of current gas stations is [they’re] not that nice of a place to spend 15, 20, or 30 minutes,” said Scott Hardman of the Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California, Davis. ​“Hopefully in the future, we’ll see more of them turn into coffee shops, cafes — places you actually want to be.”

That future is slowly coming into focus. Retailers like Wawa and Sheetz have spent the past few years exploring what the transition from selling gasoline to selling electricity might look like. Even with the headwinds EVs face, at least 26 percent of cars on U.S. roads could be electric by 2035, and some projections suggest they could account for 65 percent of all sales by 2050.

The two chains offer a place to plug in at over 10 percent of their locations. Wawa has installed more than 210 chargers, while Sheetz provides more than 650 at 95 locations that have logged at least 2 million sessions. Clean amenities and expansive menus with offerings like Wawa’s turkey-stuffed Gobbler and Sheetz’s deep-fried Big Mozz have placed them near the top of convenience store satisfaction rankings.

Both say embracing cars with cords builds on what already attracts customers. Wawa frames it as an extension of its ​“one-stop” model for food and fuel. Its competitor calls charging ​“a seamless extension of the Sheetz experience.” The language differs, but the message is the same: Selling electricity works if it brings people like John Baiano inside.

The New York resident owns two Tesla Model Ys and travels throughout the northeast for his two businesses — a Bitcoin consultancy and a horse racing operation. He plugs in at Wawa because the stores are clean, offer plenty of amenities, and provide a comfortable place to check in with clients. ​“I use the bathroom, maybe get a snack,” he said. (He prefers the turkey pinwheel.) ​“I was a little nervous about the charging aspect of things. Once I started experiencing this, it was seamless.”

At the moment, most public quick chargers are tucked away in the far corners of shopping centers, inside parking garages, and other functional but hardly inviting places to spend 20 minutes. They’re fine when you’re out and about running errands, but not terribly appealing at night and not particularly conducive to a road trip.

Tesla dominates the space with its Supercharger network, which provides over half the country’s quick chargers, with Electrify America, EVgo, and ChargePoint together accounting for another 25 to 30 percent. Retailers like Love’s Travel Stops, Pilot Flying J, and Buc-ee’s are joining Sheetz and Wawa in working with those networks and others to add chargers alongside gas pumps. Their efforts signal how a system built for gasoline is starting to evolve for electricity.

Everything Stafford and Baiano like about plugging in at a convenience store reflects an Electric Vehicle Council study that ranked security, lighting, and 24/7 access as the three things drivers want most in a charging station. Another survey found that 80 percent of them will go out of their way to get it. Reliability is another concern — and a frequent complaint with the nation’s current charging infrastructure. As EVs become more common, drivers are going to be less willing to put up with malfunctioning or broken chargers than the early adopters were.

Ryan McKinnon of the Charge Ahead Partnership, which pushes for a comprehensive charging network, sees fuel retailers as a logical place to build out such a system because they already have the right locations and amenities. ​“What EV charging needs is a competitive and lucrative marketplace where folks can actually make money selling EV charging,” he said.

Therein lies the challenge. Buying and installing a quick charger can cost more than $100,000. Beyond that lie fluctuating prices from utility companies, which one leading charging provider said is a key factor in deciding where to locate the devices. Retailers won’t recover that by selling electrons alone, given that the machines might generate just $10,000 in revenue each year, Hardman said. EVgo noted in its second-quarter earnings report that it earned just under $12,000 per stall.

Making this work for retailers requires getting people out of their cars and into the stores. Just as gas retailers earn two-thirds of their profit selling sandwiches, snacks, and sodas, those selling electricity can expect to do the same. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that installing an EV charger increased spending by 1 percent, which would cover 11 percent of the cost of installing the charger. (Other studies have found similar benefits for surrounding businesses; Tesla Superchargers can boost revenue by 4 percent.)

For some retailers, chargers are a loss leader meant to pull customers into stores, said Karl Doenges of the National Association of Convenience Stores. Others see them as a way to secure increasingly scarce electrical capacity while it’s available. Some are moving ​“forward on a charging station, even though they don’t think [the market is] 100 percent ready,” he said.

Even the strongest business cases for installing the devices depended on Washington’s help to pencil out. Incentives that the Biden administration created through the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided billions in grants, tax credits, and matching funds to help expand the fueling infrastructure of tomorrow, particularly in rural and low-income communities that a free market might overlook.

When Donald Trump won the 2024 presidential election, there was little doubt federal support for this ambitious effort would change. Yet the upheaval was more dramatic than expected. In February, the Trump administration paused the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure, or NEVI, program, the backbone of Washington’s effort to build a nationwide charging network. Fuel retailers, which have been some of the effort’s biggest beneficiaries, expressed concern.

The administration reluctantly reinstated NEVI, which had installed just 126 charging ports by the time Trump won his second term, in August. ​“If Congress is requiring the federal government to support charging stations, let’s cut the waste and do it right,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said at the time. But with most of the funding allocated, the program will likely expire in 2026.

When it revived NEVI, the Trump administration updated recommendations for states, which administer the funds, in a way that seems to favor a national network run by big chains with highway operations. The Federal Highway Administration’s guidance explicitly recommended building charging infrastructure near fuel retailers.

Nonetheless, at least some of those companies see this as a difficult moment for EV charging. Joe Sheetz, executive vice chairman of the family-owned company, has said momentum is slowing because much of the funding has come from the government and big players like Tesla. Some smaller chains are backing away, but Sheetz said his company will keep at it.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/wawa-gas-logo.webp?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=80&w=1200&s=710a779682fc0a95793c2b8c915c7f77,N,,2025-11-28 08:02:27.050362

General Electric provides Static Var Compensator and STATCOM systems engineered for flexible AC transmission and reactive power management across utility networks.","Report Overview

The Global Static Var Compensator and STATCOM Market size is expected to be worth around USD 5.0 Billion by 2034, from USD 2.0 Billion in 2024, growing at a CAGR of 9.6% during the forecast period from 2025 to 2034. In 2024, North America held a dominan market position, capturing more than a 32.5% share, holding USD 3.2 Billion revenue.

Static Var Compensators (SVCs) and STATCOMs sit at the core of modern grid-stability strategies. SVCs are thyristor-based systems that inject or absorb reactive power on high-voltage AC networks to hold voltage within tight limits over long transmission lines. STATCOMs are the next generation: voltage-source-converter FACTS devices that provide very fast reactive current support and voltage regulation at the connection point.Together, they form a critical flexibility layer as grids become more dynamic and decentralized.

The industrial backdrop is a rapid build-out of transmission and distribution infrastructure. REN21 estimates global investment in power-grid infrastructure rose 5.3% in 2023 to about USD 310 billion, with the United States investing USD 86.5 billion and China USD 78.9 billion. An IEA grid study notes that dedicated transmission spending alone reached roughly USD 140 billion in 2023, within total energy investment of USD 2.8 trillion, of which USD 1.7 trillion went to clean energy.These figures signal sustained demand for high-performance reactive-power solutions in both new and upgraded lines.

The main structural driver for SVC and STATCOM adoption is the surge in variable renewables. IRENA reports global renewable power capacity reached about 4,448 GW in 2024, after a record annual addition of 585 GW. A separate analysis finds that clean energy met just over 40% of global electricity demand in 2024, with solar near 7%, wind above 8% and hydro around 14% of generation.

Policy commitments further underpin the opportunity. The IEA projects that by 2028 renewables will account for around 42% of global electricity generation, with wind and solar alone providing 25%. IRENA’s 1.5 °C roadmap suggests that annual renewable capacity additions would need to average roughly 1,066 GW per year from 2023–2050. Delivering and integrating this volume safely requires advanced voltage-control and congestion-management technologies, giving SVC and STATCOM suppliers a long growth runway in both mature and emerging grids.

National grid-investment programmes are already translating this need into concrete projects. In China, State Grid Corporation announced transmission investments of about USD 77 billion for 2023, and plans roughly USD 329 billion over the 2021–2025 14th Five-Year Plan; China Southern Power Grid adds around USD 99 billion, bringing total planned grid spending close to USD 442 billion. Such programmes typically bundle FACTS, SVC and STATCOM installations with new ultra-high-voltage corridors and regional interconnectors. Similar though smaller-scale incentives appear in US and EU grid-modernisation and resilience schemes.

By Type Analysis

Static Var Compensators (SVC) dominate with 59.8% share driven by strong grid stability needs

In 2024, Static Var Compensators (SVC) held a dominant market position, capturing more than a 59.8% share. The strong uptake of SVC systems was supported by their widespread use in high-voltage transmission networks, where voltage stability and reactive power control continued to be critical.

The demand for SVC solutions was further strengthened by ongoing grid modernization programs across developing and developed regions, as utilities prioritized technologies capable of improving power quality and minimizing transmission losses. In 2025, the adoption of SVC systems is expected to remain steady as grid reinforcement projects expand and as power utilities focus on improving system reliability in response to rising electricity demand from industrial and renewable energy sources.

By End-User Analysis

Power utilities lead with 53.4% as they prioritized grid reliability and large-scale reactive power management.

In 2024, Power Utilities held a dominant market position, capturing more than a 53.4% share. This dominance was driven by continued investments in transmission and distribution networks where large-scale reactive power compensation was required to maintain voltage stability and reduce losses. Utility projects were favored because SVC and STATCOM installations were viewed as effective solutions for integrating renewable generation, managing peak loads, and improving overall system resilience.

Procurement was often influenced by long-term grid reinforcement plans and regulatory incentives that prioritized reliability and power quality. In 2025, utility demand was expected to remain substantial as network upgrade programs progressed and as the need to accommodate variable renewable output continued to shape investment decisions.

Emerging Trends

Hybrid STATCOM–storage hubs and digital grids reshape VAR compensation

A clear latest trend for Static Var Compensators and STATCOMs is their shift from stand-alone voltage-control devices to part of hybrid “flexibility hubs” that combine power electronics, battery storage and digital control. Grid planners are no longer buying only reactive-power support; they are designing multi-service nodes that can manage voltage, congestion and short-term balancing in one place, especially around big renewable clusters and urban load pockets.

This change is closely tied to the boom in grid-scale batteries. REN21 reports that global battery storage capacity grew by 120% in 2023 to reach about 55.7 GW, with batteries accounting for 83% of all new utility-scale storage additions and pumped hydro still holding 179 GW of installed capacity. Source: REN21 – Renewables 2024 Global Status Report, Energy Storage module. As developers co-locate batteries with wind and solar plants, grid operators increasingly specify STATCOMs at the same node to provide fast fault current and voltage support that pure storage inverters alone may not deliver.

According to REN21, global battery-storage investment rose 76.8% in 2023 to about USD 36.3 billion, with China investing USD 14.5 billion, the United States USD 9.6 billion and Germany USD 3.3 billion. Source: REN21 – Energy Storage module. These figures sit alongside rising grid investment and show that the money is moving toward flexible, electronics-rich infrastructure. For SVC and STATCOM suppliers, that means more projects where their systems are integrated from day one into storage plants, rather than added later as corrective measures.

Policy is reinforcing the trend. REN21 notes that by the end of 2023, 43 jurisdictions had specific energy-storage policies and 11 had explicit battery-storage targets. Source: REN21 – Energy Storage module. In parallel, the IEA’s Electricity Grids and Secure Energy Transitions report highlights that system-flexibility needs are set to double between 2022 and 2030, with at least 3,000 GW of renewable projects waiting in grid-connection queues, making grids a bottleneck. Source: IEA – Electricity Grids and Secure Energy Transitions.

Drivers

Rapid renewable growth and grid decarbonisation push SVC and STATCOM demand

A major driving force behind the Static Var Compensator (SVC) and STATCOM market is the fast growth of renewable electricity and the pressure to keep grids stable while cutting emissions. Wind and solar plants inject power that changes quickly with weather, which makes voltage control and reactive power support more critical at transmission and large distribution levels.

According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the world added about 473 GW of new renewable power capacity in 2023, raising total renewable capacity by 13.9%, with renewables making up 86% of all new power additions that year. IRENA’s 2025 update shows another 585 GW added in 2024, taking global renewable capacity to 4,448 GW and accounting for over 90% of total power expansion. Such volumes force grid operators to invest in dynamic VAR devices so that voltage remains within safe limits as renewable output swings.

Policy commitments reinforce this trend. At COP28, more than 130 governments, including the EU, agreed to work towards tripling global installed renewable capacity to at least 11,000 GW by 2030. This creates a long pipeline of new renewable projects that must be connected to grids that were mostly designed around synchronous thermal plants, not inverter-based generation.

At the same time, grid investment is rising, but still needs to grow. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that about USD 400 billion per year is currently spent on electricity grids worldwide, compared with roughly USD 1 trillion on generation assets. In its Net Zero by 2050 pathway, the IEA says annual clean-energy investment must more than triple to around USD 4 trillion by 2030

Restraints

High upfront cost and slow grid investment approvals limit SVC and STATCOM adoption

One major restraining factor for the Static Var Compensator (SVC) and STATCOM market is the high upfront capital cost, combined with slow grid-investment approvals. These systems are technically advanced and custom-engineered for each grid location, which makes utilities cautious, especially in cost-sensitive or regulated markets.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) explains that global electricity grid spending is currently around USD 400 billion per year, while it needs to rise to nearly USD 600 billion per year by 2030 just to keep pace with clean-energy expansion and electrification goals. When grid investment falls short, utilities often delay or scale down advanced technologies like STATCOMs and SVCs, choosing lower-cost or short-term solutions instead. This directly slows deployment, even when technical need is clear.

Cost pressure is strongest in developing economies. According to the World Bank, more than 70% of electricity network investment growth required this decade must occur in emerging and developing countries, yet many utilities in these regions face weak balance sheets and limited access to low-cost capital.

Another challenge is long approval and procurement timelines. Grid-scale projects involving FACTS devices often require environmental clearances, land permits, and multi-year regulatory reviews. The IEA notes that average transmission projects in advanced economies now take 5–10 years from planning to commissioning, even before adding power-electronics systems.

Opportunity

Digital-load growth and grid expansion open new roles for SVCs and STATCOMs

A big growth opportunity for Static Var Compensators and STATCOMs comes from how fast electricity demand is changing shape, not just growing in size. Electric vehicles, AI-heavy data centres and electrified industries are all clustering around specific nodes on the grid. That creates local voltage stress and reactive-power needs that traditional equipment cannot handle alone.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that global electricity demand will grow by about 3.3% in 2025 and 3.7% in 2026, among the highest rates seen in the last decade. Within that total, new loads are especially disruptive. In its Global EV Outlook 2025, the IEA reports that electric vehicles used around 180 TWh of electricity in 2024 and could reach roughly 780 TWh by 2030, more than a four-fold jump. Every fast-charging corridor or urban depot connected to the high-voltage network becomes a candidate site for STATCOM-based voltage support.

Data centres add another layer. The IEA’s Energy and AI analysis projects that total electricity use by data centres could rise to about 945 TWh by 2030, nearly double today and close to 3% of global electricity demand. Many of these facilities are concentrated in a few regions, which makes local voltage and flicker control critical. Utilities have started to specify dynamic VAR systems in grid-connection agreements for large clusters of cloud or AI infrastructure.

All of this sits on top of a historic wave of grid investment. The IEA notes that to stay on track for national climate targets, annual grid spending must nearly double to over USD 600 billion per year by 2030, with a strong focus on modern, digital distribution networks. A complementary assessment by the Global Renewables Alliance suggests cumulative grid investment of about USD 21 trillion by 2050, with yearly outlays exceeding USD 700 billion by 2030 to meet climate goals.

Regional Insights

North America dominates with 45.90% share (USD 0.9 Bn)

In 2024, the North American region was observed to lead the Static Var Compensator (SVC) and STATCOM market, accounting for a dominant 45.90% share and an estimated regional value of USD 0.9 billion. Market leadership in the region can be attributed to a concentrated programme of grid modernization, increased transmission investments, and utility-scale renewable integration projects that required rapid reactive power support and dynamic voltage control.

Regional incentives and tighter grid-code requirements accelerated replacement and upgrade cycles for older compensation equipment, and the rollout of HVDC interconnections further stimulated demand for fast-acting reactive power solutions. Project pipeline data showed that utility-scale wind and solar tie-ins, together with electrification of transport and industry, contributed to near-term capacity additions and sustained aftermarket service revenues. Supply chain resilience and local engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) capacity supported faster project execution times for large transmission projects, thereby reinforcing North America’s leading position.

There was some relief in October, with energy prices dropping 10 per cent nationally and 19 per cent in Sydney alone.

Transgrid CEO Brett Redman said HumeLink would unlock the full capacity of Snowy 2.0 and other new renewable energy generators, and help deliver cheap, clean power to homes across NSW.

”Transgrid and our delivery partners are getting on with the job of delivering this once-in-a-generation investment in our energy system, critical to realising the Commonwealth and NSW governments’ shared clean energy vision,” Mr Redman said.

The project is also providing an economic boost to regional communities, creating up to 1,600 construction jobs and delivering $6.3 billion in direct and indirect investment in local economies along the project alignment.

HumeLink West Project director Tim Burns said the infrastructure would deliver more than $1 billion in net benefits to Australian households and businesses through access to cheaper, more reliable renewable energy.

”Our team will keep engaging, connecting and listening to communities to make sure we’re doing what we can to support their needs, while also ensuring new economic opportunities such as local jobs and local spend with regional business continue to be created,” he said.

The project is also set to create hundreds of regional jobs and inject millions into local economies.

The reforms will establish a federal environmental protection agency, national environmental standards and higher penalties for the most significant breaches of environmental law.

They also give the federal government oversight over native forest logging.

After a contentious early-morning sitting on Friday, the Bill passed 89 to 34 at 9.40am,prompting cheers from the crowd.

Mr McCormack mirrored comments from the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive Andrew McKellar on Thursday, calling the reform package “Frankenstein’s monster”

‘(It) is going to be unleashed onto the Australian economy at a time when we’re already paying higher power prices, at a time of cost of living costs,” Mr McCormack, a former deputy Prime Ministers said.

“I mean, this is nuts.”

Mr McCormack denied that the Coalition was ineffective on the reforms and said the party would be “fighting ard over summer”, including over power prices.

‘Proud day’: Labor passes sweeping green reforms

Addressing the Bill, Anthony Albanese accused the Coalition, who had been in talks with the government over a deal as late as Wednesday night, of being a “mess … incapable of coming up with plans that were consistent”.

“They changed their decision from hour to hour,” he said.

“The final documentation from the Coalition said: ‘Oh, and there’s more’. This is yesterday afternoon.

“They couldn’t tell us what their amendments would be.”

Mr Albanese said it was a “proud day for me as Labor leader” to pass the reforms.

“This was a yes-olition,” he said.

“People who wanted reform, making a big difference on housing, energy, critical minerals, and resources.

“Projects that make a difference, unleashing our nation’s capability and backing our economy, because the stronger economy and cleaner environment depend on each other, and with these laws, our government is delivering both.”

Mr Albanese said the reforms would provide certainty to businesses, with “quicker yeses and quicker nos”, and would speed up delivery of renewable energy projects and housing.

Sussan Ley said the “Greens alliance is well and truly back in business”.

“Because, we listen to you Prime Minister every question time laying into the Greens, but today, the Greens are amazing, so nice to the Greens,” the Opposition Leader said.

“This is economy wrecking.”

Ms Ley said the Bill could have been pushed until next year.

“We know a political fix when we see one,” she said.

“This piece of rubbish was pulled out of the hat because this could have gone on to next year.

“Fifteen-hundred pages of legislation could have been properly consulted, done systematically.”

Ms Ley said energy producers claimed the Bill would put “all approvals in the slow lane”.

“That’s what’s really going to happen here if you want approvals for resources, projects, for gas,” she said.

“I thought, Prime Minister, you had a future gas strategy.

“You have no gas strategy now, nothing to provide and the affordability to bring people’s energy prices down.

“Energy producers said this will delay the new gas that has to come online to keep our electricity grid functioning.”

Greens MP Elizabeth Watson-Brown credited her party for having negotiated an end to the regional forestry agreement exemption for native forest logging.

“It shouldn’t have to be like this. We shouldn’t have to fight like this, but we do,” she said.

“If Labor had their way under the original Bill, big logging corporations would still be destroying our native forests.”

Environment Minister Murray Watt went on to deny the Bill entailed an end to regional forestry agreements or native forest logging.

Instead, he said the Bill meant the same environmental standards applied to other industries would apply to logging.

“I can categorically assure your listeners that we have not agreed to shut down native forestry in Tasmania or any other part of the country,” he told ABC Radio Hobart.

“Now, we all know that that is what the Greens have wanted to do, but we stared them down on that and rejected their demand to do that.”

He claimed the Coalition and the Greens had been “running around Tasmania telling people that we’re going to be shutting down native forestry, and that’s because that’s just a political scare campaign that works for both of them”.

Coalition environment spokeswoman Angie Bell took a swipe at Ms Watson-Brown, describing her as “the new deputy prime minister”.

The Bill also received support from independent Wentworth MP Allegra Spender, though she said it was “imperfect”.

The reforms stem from a 2020 review by Professor Graeme Samuel into the EPBC Act.

Key Takeaways

While the Agency's broader PFAS agenda and stringent state regulations will continue to drive compliance and enforcement, EPA's proposed exemptions to the one-time TSCA reporting rule are a welcome development for impacted stakeholders.

In October 2023, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (""EPA"") adopted a rule requiring per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (""PFAS"") manufacturers and importers to""submit information to EPA regarding PFAS uses, production volumes, byproducts, disposal, exposures, and existing information on environmental and health effects"" from PFAS or PFAS-containing imported articles between 2011 and 2022. The stated rationale was that it would allow EPA to ""better characterize the sources and quantities"" of ""PFAS in the United States.""Toxic Substances Control Act (""TSCA"") Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements for Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances, 40 C.F.R. § 705 (2023). The reporting rule's lengthy lookback period and the breadth of information and activities it covers have presented challenges for regulated entities, including spending resources to determine whether they are subject to the rule and what information is reportable. EPA has twice extended the initial reporting deadline, most recently to April 2026.

Earlier this month, the EPA under the Trump administration proposed several significant exemptions to the PFAS reporting rule to reduce compliance costs and burdens for regulated entities. The proposed exemptions would include:

De Minimis. PFAS in mixtures or articles at concentrations below 0.1 percent.

Imported Articles. PFAS imported as part of a manufactured item, such as a textile, that has an end-use function dependent on its shape or design and that does not have any commercially relevant change of chemical composition during use.

Byproducts, Impurities and Non-Isolated Intermediates. Typically, PFAS that emerge as byproducts of a manufacturing process (not used for commercial purposes).

Research and Development (""R&D"") Chemicals. PFAS manufactured (including imported) in small quantities for R&D purposes.

The EPA's Proposed Rule is open for public comment until December 29, 2025.

The environmental rollbacks came one after the next last week, potentially affecting everything from the survival of rare whales to the health of the Hudson River.

On Nov. 17, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed to strip federal protections from millions of acres of wetlands and streams, narrowing the reach of the Clean Water Act.

Last week, federal wildlife agencies announced changes to the Endangered Species Act that could make it harder to rescue endangered species from the brink of extinction.

The Interior Department moved to allow new oil and gas drilling across nearly 1.3 billion acres of U.S. coastal waters, including a remote region in the high Arctic where drilling has never before taken place.

If the Trump administration’s proposals are finalized and upheld in court, they could reshape U.S. environmental policy for years to come, environmental lawyers and activists said.

“This was the week from hell for environmental policy in the United States,” said Pat Parenteau, a professor emeritus and senior fellow for climate policy at Vermont Law and Graduate School. “Unless stopped by the courts, each of these proposed rollbacks will do irreparable harm to the nation’s water quality, endangered species and marine ecosystems.”

The quick pace of these proposals was notable, even for an administration that has enacted President Donald Trump’s agenda at breakneck speed.

While the administration was working in Washington to dismantle environmental protections, 3,300 miles to the south, negotiators from nearly 200 nations were trying to improve the planet’s health at the United Nations climate summit in Brazil.

A White House official, who declined to be identified, said the timing was unrelated to the U.N. climate summit, which the Trump administration boycotted this year. It was the first time since the annual summits began 30 years ago that the United States was not present.

“The Trump administration unveiled many historic announcements this week to further President Trump’s American energy dominance agenda,” Taylor Rogers, a White House spokesperson, said in an email. “President Trump serves the American people, not radical climate activists who have fallen victim to the biggest scam of the century.”

A range of industries supported the changes, including groups representing farmers, oil drillers, chemical manufacturers, homebuilders and real estate developers.

“The developments this week were definitely major steps toward the administration’s goal of achieving and restoring American energy dominance and manufacturing dominance as well,” said Chris Phalen, vice president of domestic policy at the National Association of Manufacturers, a trade group. “We’re definitely very pleased with what came out.”

The EPA kicked off the wave of deregulation Nov. 17, when it proposed to significantly scale back the Clean Water Act, which Congress passed in 1972 to protect all “waters of the United States” from pollution or destruction.

The agency said it would more narrowly define “waters of the United States” to exclude many wetlands and streams across the country. The changes could strip federal protections from up to 55 million acres of wetlands, or about 85% of all wetlands nationwide, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group.

Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., said the changes would prevent people with the smallest of waterways on their properties from needing to obtain federal permits if they wanted to fill them in or dump pollutants. “Farmers, ranchers and landowners shouldn’t have every puddle or gully regulated by D.C. bureaucrats,” she said in a statement.

The deregulatory spree picked up Wednesday, when the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service announced changes to the way the Endangered Species Act, the bedrock environmental law intended to prevent animal and plant extinctions, is applied.

The proposals would allow the government to assess economic factors, such as lost revenue from a ban on oil drilling near critical habitat, before deciding whether to list a species as endangered. At the moment, the government considers only the best available science when awarding that designation, which triggers protections against killing or harming the species and interfering with its habitat.

It was easy to miss the announcement about endangered species, which came on the same day that Trump signed legislation calling on the Justice Department to make public its files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

But the move was worth attention, said Andrew Mergen, an environmental law professor at Harvard Law School.

“It’s really hard for the public to keep track of this news, but it’s really important that they do,” Mergen said. “We’re going to lose species and their habitats in a death-by-a-thousand-cuts way, but there are things that can be done to right the ship and help these species recover.”

On Thursday, as the news cycle was dominated by Trump’s insult of a journalist, the Interior Department announced a plan to hold as many as 34 sales of leases in federal waters spanning roughly 1.27 billion acres, an area more than half the size of the United States.

The plan would require six sales of leases off the coast of California, where Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat and critic of Trump, has promised to block any new drilling. It also would mandate seven auctions of leases in the Gulf of Mexico, which Trump calls the Gulf of America, and 21 auctions of leases off the coast of Alaska, including in an isolated region called the high Arctic stretching more than 200 miles offshore.

Analysts said oil companies may not rush to snap up leases off California, where Newsom could reject permits for the infrastructure on land, such as pipelines and terminals, that is needed to support offshore drilling. Companies may also avoid the icy high Arctic, given the severe weather conditions and the lack of existing infrastructure.

Instead, oil industry interest could be concentrated in the Gulf, where drilling rigs are already plentiful. “The Gulf has the infrastructure, workforce and expertise that make it uniquely productive,” said Erik Milito, the president of the National Ocean Industries Association, a trade group that represents offshore drilling companies as well as offshore wind firms.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/a793f9_708ac866d084491fa9a728e2b9bfb04f~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_922,h_670,al_c,q_85/a793f9_708ac866d084491fa9a728e2b9bfb04f~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-11-28 02:58:11.960373

This robust growth underscores a structural shift in how Australia approaches energy, mobility and storage — moving from fossil-fuel dependence toward electrification, renewable integration and a battery-driven energy ecosystem.

Why the Market Is Growing So Rapidly

Several converging drivers are fueling Australia’s lithium-ion battery boom:

Electric Vehicles & Clean Mobility

As Australia accelerates EV adoption and considers electrifying more segments—including passenger cars, two-wheelers, and commercial fleets—the demand for high-capacity lithium-ion batteries rises sharply. Battery-powered mobility is becoming more attractive as lithium-ion battery pack prices drop, improving affordability for consumers.

Renewable Energy Storage & Grid Integration

With increasing uptake of rooftop solar and utility-scale solar and wind projects, there is a rising need for energy storage to manage intermittency and supply peaks. Lithium-ion batteries are widely used in grid-scale storage, battery-energy-storage systems (BESS), microgrids (especially in remote or mining regions), and residential solar-plus-storage setups.

Energy Transfer Investment Narrative Recap

To be a shareholder in Energy Transfer, you need to believe in the long-term demand for natural gas, the resilience of midstream energy infrastructure, and the company’s ability to secure fee-based contracts in growth sectors like data centers and LNG exports. The recent data center supply deals target a core short-term catalyst, increasing contracted volumes, but do not materially change the biggest near-term risk, which remains the potential for cost overruns and regulatory delays in Energy Transfer’s large, multi-year infrastructure projects.

Among recent announcements, the 20-year gas transportation agreement with Entergy Louisiana highlights Energy Transfer’s focus on expanding long-duration, contracted revenues in addition to the new AI and data center partnerships. This contract, supporting project stability and long-term cash flows, is particularly relevant as investors weigh the impact of major new investment commitments amid ongoing project execution and permitting risks.

However, investors should be aware that, despite these growth catalysts, the possibility of cost overruns or permitting delays in the company’s multi-billion-dollar projects remains a risk that...

As we said to the inquiry hearing in Canberra:

“This parliament could fail to pass legislation and leave us with the failed Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (EPBC Act) for another five or 10 years, which would take us past the 2030 targets and get us closer to the extinction deadline for koalas.

“The second option is that this parliament could pass these bills as proposed unamended or even weakened, as recommended by industry. That risks this parliament actually having the legacy of making a failed EPBC Act worse for nature.

“Both of those options are unthinkable.

“The only viable option is for this parliament to draft amendments to strengthen these bills to protect nature and actually deliver outcomes for nature, climate and community.

“We have really talented people in Parliamentary Counsel. We have a list of amendments and solutions right here. So it has to be option three.“

EDO is relieved that option three prevailed, with an historic deal made between the government and the Greens to amend the broken EPBC Act. The Bills have now passed the parliament.

The wins

The amendments passed through last-minute negotiations included the following significant steps forward for nature protection.

Setting an end date to the exemption from Regional Forest Agreements (RFAs) from the EPBC Act

For over 25 years, logging of Australia’s native forests has been exempted from the protection and oversight of the EPBC Act.

The amendments to the Act passed this week have legislated an end date for this exemption: 1 July 2027.

This means that any native forest logging that is likely to have a significant impact on a matter of national environmental significance (MNES) that occurs after that date must be subject to the EPBC Act.

This is a momentous change, one that legal and ecological experts have long called for and is a significant improvement to the integrity of the EPBC Act as Australia’s national environmental protection law.

However, the government has stated its intention to work with affected states to accredit forestry operations to enable those operations to take place without needing approvals for each individual operation, for example through strategic assessments, bioregional plans, or devolving approval powers for these activities.

This will require close and ongoing scrutiny to ensure the government’s stated intention to ensure that forestry operations comply with National Environmental Standards is effective and enforced.

Tightening land-clearing loopholes for the Great Barrier Reef catchment and for regrowth vegetation

Australia is a global deforestation hot spot. Until the amendments passed this week, most of that deforestation was undertaken with no effective federal oversight under the EPBC Act.

In the past decade, much of this deforestation has occurred in NSW and Qld, including in the catchment of the Great Barrier Reef, which has led to sedimentation and other pollution impacts on the World Heritage-listed treasure.

The amendments made this week make it clear that the “continuation of use” exemption does not apply to certain land clearing.

Specifically, vegetation clearing will be subject to the EPBC Act assessment where it will or may have a significant impact on a matter of national environmental significance and:

the vegetation is within 50m of a Great Barrier Reef catchment watercourse, wetland or drainage line; or

the vegetation is anywhere across Australia and has not been cleared for 15 years or more, where it is not a forestry operation.

Both amendments will commence immediately from royal assent, to reduce the risk of panic clearing.

The “continuous use” exemption has until now allowed vegetation clearing to continue without EPBC Act assessment where the vegetation was cleared prior to the EPBC Act commencing.

This has meant that vegetation areas of any size that have recovered and become important regrowth and habitat for other species could be cleared without federal oversight.

The amendments will finally remove this exemption to better protect regrowth vegetation and vegetation near waterways in the sensitive Great Barrier Reef catchment.

However, laws can only be as effective as their enforcement.

We welcome the minister’s confirmation in parliament yesterday that “the new provisions regarding agricultural land clearing and the enforcement of those provisions will certainly be a priority for the new National Environmental Protection Agency”.

Water trigger prevented from being devolved to state and territory governments

The exemption that has prevented the “water trigger” being devolved will remain in the Act. This trigger applies when large-scale coal mining and unconventional gas projects will or may be likely to have a significant impact on water resources.

It is an important safeguard to ensure federal oversight of impacts to our water resources from these highly impactful activities.

This trigger has ensured federal oversight and stronger regulation of the water impacts of some of the largest fossil fuel projects applied for in Australia, including the Adani Carmichael coal mine and fracking in the Northern Territory Beetaloo Basin.

The original Bills had proposed to remove the exemption in the Act to allow this trigger to be devolved for assessment and approval by states and territories.

Since water laws under state and territory governments have not provided sufficient protection against the unsustainable impacts of coal and unconventional gas projects, this would have been catastrophic for the sustainability of Australia’s water resources for all water users.

But the amendments yesterday prevented this move, ensuring the powers remain with the federal government.

Some new safeguards around devolution of EPBC Act powers

The amendments require that accreditation of assessment processes must be in place before approval powers are devolved to a state or territory government or other entity.

This ensures that there will be a process of reviewing and hopefully strengthening state and territory assessment processes to meet the accreditation requirements before approval powers are devolved.

This new requirement will not apply where the activities subject to devolution are under a Regional Forest Agreement, in which case the approval powers can be devolved without accreditation of assessment powers first.

Bilateral agreements must also now include a power for the minister to “call in” specific activities for assessment by the minister instead of being assessed under a devolved pathway by a state or territory government or other entity.

There is also a new requirement for the CEO of the National EPA to review bilateral agreements where the accredited framework has been amended to ensure that the National Environmental Standards and other criteria are still being met.

The CEO must advise the minister of their review and whether they recommend any variations, suspensions or cancellations of the agreement are necessary because the criteria are no longer met.

Exclusion of fossil fuels from streamlined assessment, national interest approval exemptions and bioregional planning pathways

Fossil fuel activities are prohibited from moving through the new streamlined assessment pathway and the bioregional planning pathway as a priority activity in a “go zone”.

There is also a prohibition on applying the new national interest approval exemption to fossil fuel activities.

The new national interest approval power allows an activity to be exempt from parts of the EPBC Act where it may be considered in the “national interest”.

Fossil fuel activities are defined to include coal, gas and petroleum extraction and production activities, and Minister Watt confirmed in the Senate when the Bills passed that this includes exploration activities.

This will prevent any government allowing the fast-tracking of coal and gas activities without adequate assessment or public consultation.

However, these pathways still lack sufficient guardrails to ensure adequate environmental assessment and public oversight.

They can still be used to fast-track all other activities, including other resource activities, large-scale vegetation clearing, critical mineral mining, and renewable energy projects in inappropriate locations.

Amendments are needed via regulations and the Standards to put in place guardrails to ensure adequate environmental assessment and consultation around impactful activities, ideally limiting fast-tracking to only low-risk activities.

The “preliminary documentation” assessment pathway has also been maintained in the EPBC Act, where the original Bill proposed its removal.

This provides a pathway between the streamlined assessment and environmental impact statement pathways.

Less discretion when applying National Environmental Standards

The application of National Environmental Standards will now have to meet a positive test of a decision being “consistent with” rather than “not inconsistent with” the Standards.

This will apply when assessing individual projects at the federal level, as well as when the minister is assessing whether state or territory frameworks meet the Standards to allow for devolution of EPBC Act powers.

The discretionary test of the minister’s “satisfaction” remains in all decisions.

However, this is a step forward in requiring a more positive duty for each of the elements of the Standards to be met.

Offsets via “pay to destroy” restoration fund not possible for specified threatened species

Amendments were made yesterday with respect to the application of the new Restoration Contributions Special Account, which allows developers to “pay to destroy” by providing money (a “restoration contribution charge”) into the account rather than securing actual offsets that meet all offset principles.

The amendments enable impacts on specific matters (e.g., threatened species) to be excluded from being offset through payment into the account.

This will occur through the use of a new power to make declarations that certain matters cannot be offset via payment.

It is uncertain at this stage which matters will be declared under this new power.

There is still work needed and it is possible to strengthen the proposed Offsets Standard (currently on public exhibition).

For example, this could be done by ensuring all offsets, including those created through payments in a restoration contribution fund, must meet all offset principles.

Methods for calculating restoration contribution charges will also be developed.

Protection statements can also provide information on threatened species and communities that can help identify unacceptable impacts that cannot be offset.

This may help ensure impacts to these matters are not being allowed on the basis of a fallacy that they can be offset.

Review of the EPBC Act now every five years

The EPBC Act will now be subject to review every five years, changed from the current requirement of a review every 10 years.

This will be helpful in providing greater insight into whether the Act is meeting its objects.

It will also creates a helpful impetus for more frequent further amendments where changes are needed.

The concerns

Unacceptable impacts test subject to higher bar

The Environment Protection Reform Bill as introduced provided unacceptable impacts criteria applicable to all matters of national environmental significance.

While these definitions were criticised for needing to be more specific or scientifically founded, they are helpful in providing more guidance as to when impacts should be considered unacceptable for each environmental matter.

Significantly, where it is established that there are unacceptable impacts, the minister will not be able to approve an action.

Unfortunately, during the amendments to the Bill, the test that needs to be met to consider an impact unacceptable was weakened.

These criteria are now subject to a higher bar of certainty that the impact will occur, for example by removing the language that an impact may “be likely to have” an unacceptable impact.

The definitions otherwise remain in place as unique criteria for each matter of national environmental significance, despite many submissions from industries that sought to reduce the criteria to a single provision to be applied to every different matter of national environmental significance.

Climate impact assessment remains the same

No amendments were secured with respect to strengthening the assessment of climate impacts, and so companies will still only be required to disclose scope 1 and 2 emissions in their applications under the EPBC Act and to provide a plan for managing those impacts.

However, under the EPBC Act currently scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions can be considered in assessment of the impact of activities on matters of national environmental significance and this has not changed under the reforms.

Companies often have provided disclosure of all emissions in their EPBC referral applications over the past few years, and so responsible companies may still provide disclosure of their scope 3 emissions, particularly where this is required by jurisdictions such as NSW and Qld.

Stop-work environmental protection order powers curtailed

The power to provide environmental protection orders to address urgent illegal environmental impacts has been limited, with the orders now to expire 14 days after provision. This can be extended by a maximum further 14 days.

Further, the CEO of the EPA must now provide a level of evidence to support their reasonable belief that an environmental protection order is required.

This could slow the ability for the EPA to provide orders to stop serious imminent environmental harm.

New National EPA needs greater independence

The Bills finally introduce the long-awaited National Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), a key commitment of this government.

The EPA will have legislated enforcement powers but will only have assessment and approval powers when delegated by the minister.

When acting in a delegated power, the EPA can be subject to the direction of the minister, impacting their independence.

However, when acting in a legislated power, the EPA is not subject to the direction of the minister and must simply provide a Statement of Intent in response to the minister’s Statement of Expectation.

There will be no independent board to govern the EPA. The CEO will be appointed by the Governor-General on the minister’s satisfaction that they meet the required criteria.

EDO recommended the EPA have sufficient independence to ensure it could administer the EPBC Act without political influence.

The Bills do not remove this risk, however, the EPA as created does have some level of independence, which is a step forward, and from here its independence can hopefully be strengthened.

The process

The arbitrary deadline that the Bills must be passed before Christmas, while the Senate inquiry was still receiving submissions, was a political decision.

It meant that 1500 pages of technical legislation was rushed through without time for proper scrutiny, not only by parliamentarians voting on amendments, but also by experts, stakeholders and community members wanting to provide input on these critical Bills through the Senate committee inquiry process.

This is highly regrettable and a blight on Australia’s federal environment laws.

It increases the risk of drafting errors and unintentional consequences of rushed amendments.

Australia’s environmental laws, and their importance in protecting Australia’s most precious species and places, should be handled with more respect and consideration than was the case this year.

The unfinished business – what happens next?

The passing of the Bills is a pivotal moment. The reforms promise to deliver some significant gains and some safeguards for nature and communities, but it’s not over yet.

The Senate inquiry that was commenced to scrutinise the Bills will continue but will turn its attention to the oversight of the National Environmental Standards.

This is good news because it means there will be an opportunity to give the Standards the consideration they warrant given their significance in strengthening the Act, as proposed by Professor Samuel’s review.

Two draft National Environmental Standards are currently open for consultation until 5pm, Friday, 30 January 2026:

Draft MNES Standards – to provide more guidance on the assessment of impacts to matters of national environmental significance; and

Draft Offsets Standard – focused on providing improved criteria for offsets, to ensure they are effective at achieving their aims. This draft also introduces criteria around the new restorations contribution fund.

Find the draft Standards and guidance documents and details of how to have your say here.

There will also be a need for amendments to the regulations that sit under the EPBC Act to ensure safeguards are placed on key risks, like the new streamlined assessment pathway, and other policies to support the changes, including the development of methods to determine offset charges.",https://www.edo.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/shutterstock_757121674-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 05:59:00.098007

See, e.g., U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Nuclear Energy, Commercial AI & Energy Generation Infrastructure Program at Idaho National Laboratory, Request for Application Number: DE-FOA-0003578 Amendment 07 (11/05/2025).","The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is accelerating efforts to transform sections of its federal land portfolio into strategic hubs for artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled data centers and advanced energy infrastructure.

These priorities respond to surging demand for digital and computational power and the critical need for secure, resilient baseload electricity and support President Trump's priorities to maintain and enhance American leadership in AI and energy generation.1 In pursuit of this national agenda, DOE began by soliciting industry feedback with a spring 2025 Request for Information (RFI for AI Infrastructure) on siting AI infrastructure on DOE-owned or DOE-managed land assets, focusing on improving and accelerating data center construction, energy technologies, and operational partnerships and building out the nation's readiness for and competitive advantage in AI innovation and infrastructure.2

Of the 16 potential federal sites explored in the RFI for AI Infrastructure, Secretary Wright selected four ""winning"" sites in a July 24th announcement for U.S. companies to build and power AI data centers. Shortly thereafter, DOE moved forward with requests for proposals (RFPs), requests for offers (RFOs), and requests for applications (RFAs) for these four sites.

On September 9, DOE's Idaho Operations Office issued an RFA seeking applications by November 7, 2025, for projects at Idaho National Laboratory (INL).

On September 30, DOE's Office of Environmental Management and Office of Science issued an RFP seeking proposals by December 1, 2025, for projects at the Oak Ridge Reservation.

On September 30, the National Nuclear Security Administration issued an RFP seeking proposals by December 6, 2025, for projects at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina.

On October 31, 2025, DOE's Office of Environmental Management issued an RFO seeking proposals by January 30, 2026, for projects at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PGDP) in Kentucky.

For each solicitation, DOE has focused on three configurations of project proposals: Integrated Data Center and Energy Projects, Phased Integrated AI Data Center and Energy Projects, and Energy Infrastructure Projects.3 Each solicitation expresses a preference for innovative energy technology, including nuclear and geothermal technologies, for potential generation sources and requires that new sources be incorporated either directly into the project design or indirectly through a partnership between the AI data center operators and new energy generators.

DOE's latest solicitation centers on the site of the PDGP, a legacy facility on a 3,555-acre reservation that was devoted to uranium enrichment from the early 1950s until its closure in 2013.4 The RFO identifies approximately 785 acres available for development; the Paducah site itself is capable of supporting up to 3 gigawatts of energy production in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) power market, in addition to large-load data centers employing that power. The site boasts abundant water resources, positioning it as a practical host for large-scale, energy-intensive data centers with water cooling systems.

In addition to the Paducah site, three other DOE-managed sites are active targets for major data center projects: the INL site in Idaho underwent a similar RFP process earlier in the fall. Bids for the INL site were due on November 7, with selections expected to be announced by December 19. The RFP offers 44,000 acres prioritized for rapid deployment,5 significantly more than the other sites. Like all the selected sites, the INL site has deep ties to the nation's history of nuclear development. Notably, DOE already has performed extensive site characterization and permitting activities for new nuclear reactors at INL for the National Reactor Innovation Center.6

The Savannah River site offers a portfolio of developable land tracts totaling over 3,100 acres within a much larger legacy nuclear site. DOE anticipates leasing approximately 250 to 450 acres of the total acreage. Its solicitation seeks to leverage the site's grid access and onsite transmission resources,7 established water infrastructure, and long-haul fiber corridors. At the same time, the Savannah River site presents unique regulatory and environmental challenges due to its long and complicated history of nuclear production and environmental remediation, requiring careful coordination with and integration of any future projects into ongoing federal operations.

Among the potential development sites, the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Reservation, which comprises appropriately 245 acres across two distinct areas, stands out for its proximity to the flagship research institution and skilled workforce, as well as extensive preexisting infrastructure and Tennessee Valley Authority 500kV transmission lines. The solicitation for the Oak Ridge site is well-suited to public-private technology partnerships but introduces complexity due to overlapping scientific missions and important but potentially burdensome safety protocols.

All four sites provide substantial baseload power capabilities and appealing physical layouts and scale to support substantial data center construction, but each features distinct advantages and operational hurdles and a unique and complicated history of nuclear fuel development and usage, along with potential site remediation challenges, requiring careful coordination with and integration of any future projects into ongoing federal operations. For this reason, bidders are encouraged to consider the ""as is, where is"" nature of the government's proffered lease terms. Project owners will be responsible for building, operating, and decommissioning each infrastructure project and must secure utility interconnection agreements. Proposals will be competitively evaluated for technological readiness, financial viability, and detailed plans to complete regulatory and permitting requirements.

Key Takeaways for Clients

The speed with which DOE has pushed this initiative forward through the stages of federal procurement during the course of 2025 indicates the degree to which the current administration is leveraging the resources of the federal government, including its vast real estate holdings and opportunities to leverage multiple funding sources,8 to prioritize AI buildout and construction of new sources of energy generation. Although DOE has focused on four initial sites, more could follow, and companies seeking to develop large-scale data center projects co-located with generation should consider whether any other federal sites, especially those with built-in interconnection facilities, might be suitable for productive reuse.

DOE's initial focus on four sites with nuclear history bespeaks a clear desire to revitalize the nation's nuclear energy industry and enlist it in the service of AI buildout. The push to make productive use of decommissioned industrial sites predates the current administration, meaning that even as this initiative reflects the priorities of the current administration, it also advances longer-term, bipartisan policy goals.

With several previously closed nuclear power plants announcing plans in recent months for renewed operations to serve large data center offtakers,9 the need for vast quantities of reliable energy production makes nuclear a great fit for AI companies and other data center operators. Even so, with construction timelines for new nuclear power stretching far beyond near-term data center buildout, smaller modular nuclear reactors with shorter construction horizons may meet with more success in the near term, including as bidders for these sites.

At the same time, DOE's focus across all four solicitations on geothermal energy reflects a desire to support recent breakthroughs in geothermal technology that make it possible for more widespread buildout. With active support from the current administration that has been absent in its treatment of other renewable technologies, as well as steady, reliable energy flow and a light environmental footprint, geothermal seems uniquely well-suited to the needs of AI companies and data center operators.

DOE has advanced these procurement processes rapidly, but once projects are awarded, they will still need to negotiate leases with the federal government, which will be complex. It remains to be seen whether the terms and conditions of these leases set forth in each solicitation will prove commercially acceptable to developers. Projects will also need to move through federal permitting, including the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the National Historic Preservation Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, and other applicable regulatory requirements. Absent substantial exemptions from federal permitting, which do not appear to be contemplated within the terms of these solicitations, aggressive construction timelines may become challenged, particularly in light of the rescission of the Council on Environmental Quality and DOE's NEPA regulations and the reliance instead only on DOE's new NEPA implementation procedures. With that in mind, the extent of federal fast-tracking remains a critical unanswered question.10 Even with the government's active support, the fundamentals of large infrastructure project development still apply. That means that issues like electrical interconnection and access to transmission remain the largest potential vulnerabilities for large new generation sources. That makes the Paducah site particularly appealing as a prime location for high-capacity, energy-intensive projects, benefiting from MISO market access and other built-in resources.

Finally, it is worth noting that the federal government's stake in AI buildout is multifaceted. It has an interest in furthering American industry, a national security interest as China and other nations race for AI supremacy, and an interest as a potential client of advanced AI systems. Here, although no DOE procurement of goods or services is included as a component of any of the open solicitations, the close proximity of many of these sites to the ongoing advanced nuclear research operations at various National Laboratories makes the latter potential relationship particularly intriguing.

In today’s RBN blog, we’ll discuss the controversy and how we think it’s likely to be resolved.
The EUMR is part of the EU’s long-term effort to achieve carbon neutrality and its “Fit for 55” program, an effort to reduce the EU’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 55% by 2030.
(See our A Whole New World blog and five-part Time Has Come Today series for more on “certified,” “differentiated” or “responsibly sourced” gas.)
As shown in Figure 1 below, the U.S.’s share of total LNG imports to Europe (top row) has doubled over the past four years, from 28% in the first half of 2021 to 57% in the first half of 2025.","For months, the Trump administration and energy industry groups have been pressing the European Union (EU) to either scrap or significantly ease its regulations on methane emissions. They assert the methane monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) requirements, set to ratchet up in 2027, 2028 and 2030, would be impossible for U.S. natural gas producers to meet and result in a sharp decline in — or even an end to — U.S. LNG flows to the EU. In today’s RBN blog, we’ll discuss the controversy and how we think it’s likely to be resolved.

As we said in The Times They Are a-Changin’, the 27-member EU in May 2024 approved the European Union Methane Regulation (EUMR), legislation that, among other things, established methane emission reporting requirements for EU energy producers and LNG importers and a timeline for setting a methane intensity (MI) target for imported LNG. The EUMR is part of the EU’s long-term effort to achieve carbon neutrality and its “Fit for 55” program, an effort to reduce the EU’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 55% by 2030. Starting in January 2027, the methane regulation will require the companies importing LNG into Europe to prove that the MRV practices of gas producers in the LNG-exporting countries they deal with are at least as stringent as those followed by energy producers within the EU. In August 2028, LNG importers will need to start providing the MI of their gas and starting in August 2030 they will have to prove that their gas’s MI does not exceed a yet-to-be-established MI cap.

Methane is the second-most-impactful GHG — only carbon dioxide (CO2) has a greater heat-trapping effect on the atmosphere — and U.S. gas producers have been working for many years to reduce methane emissions from their operations by phasing out flaring, implementing leak detection and repair (LDAR) programs and replacing gas-powered pumps with electric ones. (See our A Whole New World blog and five-part Time Has Come Today series for more on “certified,” “differentiated” or “responsibly sourced” gas.) These efforts to minimize emissions have been motivated both by economics and the pursuit of operational excellence — after all, natural gas is typically more than 90% methane; why waste it? — and by the expectation that future U.S. and international regulations, including those now being implemented by the EU, will mandate lower and lower MIs for their gas.

Our understanding is that at least 25%, and possibly more than one-third, of total U.S. natural gas production is already being assessed based on methane emissions, mostly by the not-for-profit MiQ but also by other independent certification entities. Expand Energy, the largest U.S. gas producer, noted in its Q3 2025 earnings presentation that 100% of its gas production is now independently certified (mostly by MiQ), and that its companywide MI is only 0.2% — well below the 1% to 2% MI that had been more typical among gas producers in the late 2010s. Similarly, EQT Corp., the #2 gas producer in the U.S., said in June that its Marcellus/Utica-focused production (also independently certified by MiQ) has achieved an MI of only 0.007%, “significantly surpassing its 2025 target of 0.2%.”

This might suggest that U.S. gas producers and LNG exporters would have no problem complying with whatever MI-related rules the EU puts in place, and that the U.S. could continue to provide EU members and other countries in Europe with the substantial volumes of LNG they need to keep the lights on. As shown in Figure 1 below, the U.S.’s share of total LNG imports to Europe (top row) has doubled over the past four years, from 28% in the first half of 2021 to 57% in the first half of 2025. That’s more than 4X the 13% share provided by Russia (which the EU is phasing out as a gas supplier by the end of 2027), 7X Qatar’s 8% share, and 8X Algeria’s 7% share in the first half of this year.",https://rbnenergy.com/sites/default/files/styles/social_image/public/single-use/2025-11/Fig1_Share%20of%20European%20LNG%20Imports%20by%20Supplying%20Country%2C%202021-25.png?itok=D0gFfBnc,N,,2025-11-28 02:58:20.911240

“Planning to build a new pipeline in 2025 is fundamentally irreconcilable with the International Court of Justice’s opinion affirming states’ duties to prevent further climate harm,” said David Suzuki Foundation climate director Sabaa Khan.
“The federal government can’t claim to respect its climate commitments under international law while underwriting fossil fuel expansion that locks Canada into decades of avoidable emissions.
“The notion that Canada can meaningfully shift toward sustainability while doubling down on fossil fuel infrastructure is simply unrealistic,” Khan said.

VANCOUVER — UNCEDED xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (MUSQUEAM), Sḵwx̱wú7mesh (SQUAMISH) AND səlilwətaɬ (TSLEIL-WAUTUTH) TERRITORIES (November 27, 2025)

Prime Minister Mark Carney and Alberta Premier Danielle Smith dealt a devastating blow to climate and nature by signing a memorandum of understanding for a new Alberta-to–British Columbia bitumen pipeline while scrapping environmental policies. The David Suzuki Foundation vehemently opposes this proposed pipeline and calls on the federal government to stand firm on environmental standards and advance Canada’s clean energy transition.

“Planning to build a new pipeline in 2025 is fundamentally irreconcilable with the International Court of Justice’s opinion affirming states’ duties to prevent further climate harm,” said David Suzuki Foundation climate director Sabaa Khan. “The federal government can’t claim to respect its climate commitments under international law while underwriting fossil fuel expansion that locks Canada into decades of avoidable emissions. This is not only a moral and legal contradiction; it is a massive financial risk.”

The Foundation denounces the prime minister’s misleading comment that this pipeline represents an “energy transition” when it aims to scrap hard-fought environmental protections. “The notion that Canada can meaningfully shift toward sustainability while doubling down on fossil fuel infrastructure is simply unrealistic,” Khan said. “A true energy transition can’t be built on expanded oil pipelines, liquefied natural gas exports or increased fossil fuel production — even with unproven ‘carbon capture’ tacked on.”

Every dollar invested in new oil and gas infrastructure today is a future stranded asset tomorrow, and a pollution legacy that Canadians will be forced to clean up long after profits have left the country. “Burning fossil fuels is the main cause of climate change. Canadians deserve a government that protects them from climate and liability risks, not one that sacrifices environmental standards to prop up a declining, high-pollution industry. This pipeline is legally indefensible,” Khan said.

Indigenous communities are most at risk from climate change because of their close ties to the natural environment, the injustices and burdens of colonialism, and the effects of industrial resource extraction. “This proposed pipeline is a massive economic and health threat that takes us further away from true reconciliation,” Khan said.

“B.C.’s north coast is rugged, wild and priceless. Home to iconic species and sensitive ecosystems, its waters are famous for fierce storms and treacherous passages,” said Erin Roger, nature director at the David Suzuki Foundation. “A new pipeline will destroy habitats, displace species and increase the risk of oil spills, which would be catastrophic for the region. Weakening the tanker ban with ‘appropriate adjustments’ for increased tanker traffic defeats the purpose of the ban. We need our political leaders to focus on projects that protect and restore natural spaces — not roll back environmental safeguards.”

The Foundation argues that Canada should be using this political moment to focus on real nation-building projects.

“More than wasting precious time and money on a pipeline that will never be built, this MOU is also a death blow to Canada’s clean electricity regulations, adding to the abandonment of climate action from this federal government,” said Stephen Thomas, clean energy manager at the David Suzuki Foundation. “Low-cost renewable energy and a strengthened east-west grid are among the strongest opportunities we have to save Canadians money on their energy bills, create good jobs and position Canada for the future. Our federal government needs to get out of its own way and start building the future we know is possible.”

At the center of this legislative shift is “Iryna’s Law,” a high-profile Republican-backed measure inspired by the death of Iryna Zarutska, a Ukrainian woman killed on a Charlotte city bus, a case that drew national attention and pressure from federal leaders. State lawmakers fast-tracked the bill earlier this year, framing it as a direct response to what they called failures in how the state handles violent offenders before trial.

House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) has described the law as a “first step to ensure what happened to her never happens again.”

Governor Josh Stein, who signed the bill in October, offered mixed praise — supporting the tighter pretrial release rules, while calling the death penalty provisions “barbaric” and urging lawmakers to invest more heavily in mental health resources.

Stricter Pretrial Release Rules & New Oversight of Magistrates

Under “Iryna’s Law,” people charged with violent offenses will now face significantly tougher release conditions. Instead of being able to secure quick release through a magistrate, defendants accused of certain crimes must receive:

A secured bond, or

GPS-monitored house arrest

The law is designed to eliminate low-level release options for repeat or high-risk offenders and shifts greater responsibility onto the judiciary. Court magistrates, who often oversee the earliest release decisions, are now subject to suspension by Chief Justice Paul Newby if they fail to follow the law’s requirements — a level of oversight not previously in place.

Death Penalty Process Tightened — New Methods Could Be Required

“Iryna’s Law” also aims to streamline parts of North Carolina’s long-stalled death penalty process. Lethal injection remains the state’s default method, but executions have been paused for nearly 20 years due to ongoing legal battles and regulatory challenges.

Under the new statute:

If lethal injection is ever ruled unconstitutional,

North Carolina must adopt a new method — potentially including the electric chair or firing squad.

‘Public Safety Act of 2025’: New Felonies & Tougher Penalties for Drugs and Repeat Offenders

Also taking effect December 1 is the Public Safety Act of 2025, a wide-ranging criminal justice package that alters several parts of state law — from drug offenses to domestic violence protections and firearm release rules.

Key changes include:

New Felony Crimes

Exposing a child under 16 to controlled substances

A new “habitual domestic violence” felony for people with repeated DV convictions

Online solicitation of minors now upgraded to more severe felony levels

Stronger Drug Penalties

Penalties increase for possession, trafficking, and sale of:

Fentanyl

Carfentanil

Firearms Release Changes

Sheriffs may now release surrendered firearms back to defendants without a court order — if a background check shows they are legally eligible.

Tightened Post-Conviction Deadlines

Defendants must file motions for relief within seven years of a qualifying event related to their conviction.

Out-of-State Protective Orders

People who live in another state can now pursue North Carolina protective orders if the abuse occurred within NC.

More North Carolina Laws Taking Effect Dec. 1

The December legal rollout includes dozens of additional changes. Some of the most notable:

New Criminal Penalties & Enhancements

Illegal sale/possession of embalming fluid

Larceny of gift cards

Higher penalties for mail theft

Longer sentences for assaulting utility or communications workers

Online Sexual Exploitation Protections

Websites hosting content must adopt procedures to remove pornographic images upon request. The Attorney General can pursue violators — including users and site operators.

The law also requires the state registrar to keep earlier versions of birth certificates when individuals request sex-marker changes.

A controversial section defining “male,” “female,” and “biological sex” will take effect Jan. 1, following a veto override of Gov. Stein.

Expanded Auditor Powers

State Auditor Beth Wood’s office can now investigate any entity receiving state or federal funds. Gov. Stein vetoed the measure, but lawmakers overrode it.

Disaster Recovery Non-Discrimination

Discriminating based on political affiliation during disaster recovery assistance is now a felony — legislation sparked by a reported incident involving a FEMA supervisor after Hurricane Milton.

Faster Squatter Removal

Property owners can now initiate an expedited process for removing squatters.

Changes to Tinted Window Rules

Window tint is no longer part of the state’s safety inspection checklist. Drivers must simply roll down their windows when stopped by law enforcement.

The Hardware Treadmill: A high-end CPU might last 5-7 years in a data center.","The Cloud"" might be the greatest branding trick in history. It sounds fluffy, ethereal, and notably light.

It implies that our digital lives…our emails, our crypto wallets, our endless scrolling…exist in some vaporous layer of the atmosphere, detached from earthly constraints.

But if you actually drive out to Loudoun County, Virginia, or stare at the arid plains of Altoona, Iowa, you realize the Cloud is actually just a very big, very loud, and very hot factory.

We’ve been telling ourselves a lovely story about the energy transition. We were retiring coal plants, building wind farms, and decoupling economic growth from carbon emissions. It was all going according to plan.

For years, the tech sector achieved relative decoupling…

Moore's Law kept server efficiency gains ahead of the curve, allowing internet traffic to surge while power demand grew slowly.

The exponential curve of AI, however, has shattered this delicate balance. AI workloads are so compute-intensive that demand is now skyrocketing faster than efficiency gains can compensate.

This is a re-coupling with physics..and the defining narrative of the next decade isn't about supply anymore.

Now it's about a structural shift in demand that almost nobody priced in: The thermodynamics of Artificial Intelligence.

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), global electricity demand from data centers is projected to more than double by 2030. This is the same as the entire annual electricity use of a country like Japan.

The invisible hand is hitting a concrete wall.

The question is no longer if the grid can handle it, but what is making the demand curve look like a rocket launch. The answer isn't better software or smarter algorithms; it's the raw physics happening inside a rack that now demands the power of a city block.

The Thermodynamics of ""Thinking""

To understand why the grid is struggling right now, you have to look at the silicon.

For a long time, we ran the internet on CPUs (Central Processing Units). These are the general managers of the chip world. Efficient, predictable.

But Generative AI doesn't want a manager. It wants a battalion of mathematicians. It runs on GPUs (Graphics Processing Units), specifically monsters like Nvidia’s H100.

Here’s what that actually means for power draw:

Traditional server rack: Draws about 5 to 10 kilowatts (kW).

Modern AI rack (H100s/Blackwell): Draws 50 to 100 kW.

We have effectively moved from powering a toaster to powering a neighborhood, all inside the same metal box. Air cooling…fans blowing over hot metal…doesn't work anymore. Air just isn't physically dense enough to move that much heat away.

We are now plumbing data centers like chemical refineries, running liquid coolant loops directly to the silicon die.

This is the new reality of Direct-to-Chip (DTC) cooling. It is already happening in cutting-edge AI centers because it is the only way to manage the extreme heat density of chips like the H100.

Liquid cooling saves energy compared to air conditioning. While the chip itself still draws 100 kW, the overall cooling system…the pumps and chillers…consumes far less power than running massive air handlers for the whole room. This makes it an efficiency measure born of necessity.

The next step is Immersion Cooling, where entire server racks are submerged in a non-conductive fluid. This is also being deployed now, often in pilot programs and specialized facilities.

This shift from fans to specialized plumbing and chemically inert fluids is the physical realization of the industrialization of thought.

Just like the industrialization of textiles or steel, it requires massive inputs of raw power and exotic, specialty materials. This industrial intensity demands something traditional renewable sources…intermittent solar and wind…struggle to provide: reliability.

When an AI training run costs tens of millions of dollars, a 1% flicker is an existential threat.

The Dirty Secret of the ""Green"" AI Boom

Every major tech CEO is currently on a podcast tour talking about their ""Net Zero"" 2030 goals. And sure, they are buying a lot of paper credits.

But physics doesn't care about carbon offsets. The reality is that AI needs baseload power. It needs to run 24/7/365 with ""five nines"" (99.999%) of reliability.

You know what provides that?

Nuclear (which takes 10 years to build).

Batteries (which we don't have enough of).

Fossil Fuels.

According to IEA data, coal still accounts for about 30% of global data center power. And in the U.S., natural gas is doing the heavy lifting, covering over 40% of demand.

The irony is palpable. We spent billions trying to kill coal, only to have the most futuristic technology on earth, AI, throw it a lifeline.

In places like Virginia or Kansas, utilities are delaying the retirement of coal plants. They simply cannot risk the grid instability when a gigawatt-scale data center comes online.

The ""future"" is being powered by the ""past.""

The need for this reliable baseload power, combined with the sheer gigawatt-scale hunger of these new facilities, is now fundamentally reshaping the American power landscape. Capital always flows to the path of least resistance—and right now, that path runs right through communities that have never seen a single dollar of tech prosperity.

The New Geography of Power (and Inequality)

This energy hunger is redrawing the map. We are seeing a ""K-shaped"" geography of infrastructure.

In the U.S., ""Data Center Alley"" in Northern Virginia supposedly handles 70% of the world's internet traffic. But the grid there is tapped out. You can't get a new hookup for years.

So, the capital is fleeing to places with looser regulations and cheaper land: Texas, Ohio, Arizona.

But this brings us to the friction point. These facilities are neighbors. And they are often bad neighbors. They are loud, they consume massive amounts of water for cooling, and they raise local utility rates.

There is also a significant Environmental Justice component here. Industrial infrastructure is rarely sited in wealthy neighborhoods.

According to the NAACP's ""Fumes Across the Fence-Line"" report:

African Americans are 75% more likely than white Americans to live in ""fence-line"" communities (areas adjacent to industrial facilities).

A disproportionate number of fossil-fuel peaker plants, which fire up when data centers max out the grid, are located in low-income areas and communities of color.

This directly contributes to higher rates of asthma and respiratory issues.

While the ""invisible prosperity"" of AI stock gains flows to portfolios in San Francisco and New York, the ""visible decay""...the pollution, the water usage, the hum of the cooling fans…is localized in communities that often see none of the upside.

Even if a community were willing to bear the cost, the industrial machine that once smoothly supplied the electrical grid is choked.

The problem is no longer just where to put the data center, but how to physically connect the massive, power-hungry factory to the existing grid infrastructure. This process is crippled by a global bottleneck of essential, non-digital hardware.

The Great Transformer Shortage

Let’s say you have the money, the land, and the permits. You still have a problem. You can’t get the gear.

The lead time for a high-voltage power transformer used to be 12 months. Today? It’s 3 to 5 years.

We are trying to rebuild the electrical grid at the exact moment everyone else is trying to electrify cars and heat pumps. The supply chain is fractured.

We are also running out of the raw stuff: Copper. Lithium. Neodymium for the magnets in the cooling fans.

We are dependent on China for the processing of nearly all these critical minerals. As I explained in this “Data Center Guide,” we are realizing that the digital economy is actually a material economy.

If China restricts graphite or gallium exports (which they have started doing), the Cloud stops growing.

The ""Trust Me, Bro"" Efficiency Pitch

The counter-argument from Silicon Valley is the ""Handprint"" theory. The pitch goes like this: Yes, training the AI uses a lot of energy, but the AI will make the rest of the world so efficient that it pays for itself.

The IEA models suggest that AI could optimize logistics, manage smart grids, and reduce building energy usage by 10-20%.

And honestly? It’s a compelling argument. If AI can figure out how to drive a truck platoon 5% more efficiently, that saves more carbon than the data center emits.

But this is a long-term bet against a short-term, guaranteed withdrawal of power.

The core efficiency problem is two-fold:

Training vs. Inference: Training a colossal model takes a massive, months-long burst of power. The resulting AI is then put to work performing inference…answering questions. While inference is far cheaper per interaction than training, its global volume is exponentially growing, turning tiny energy costs into a massive, persistent drain.

The Hardware Treadmill: A high-end CPU might last 5-7 years in a data center. The new AI GPUs are considered obsolete in as little as two years. This brutal, accelerated hardware cycle…the constant replacement of power-hungry H100s with even more power-hungry Blackwells…means that the embodied carbon and raw materials tied up in the silicon are never given a chance to pay back their energy debt over a reasonable lifespan.

We are spending the carbon now in hopes of efficiency later. While the industry is working on ""smarter"" silicon, efficient ASICs for inference, that transition won't arrive fast enough to save the grid from the current exponential surge.

What Comes Next?

We are moving from an era of Generation Constraints to Connection Constraints.

The most valuable asset in the world right now isn't the H100 chip; it’s a signed interconnection agreement with a utility company. The ""queue"" to get on the grid is the new velvet rope.

This is going to force a few things:

Off-Grid AI: Tech giants will stop waiting for the utility. They will build their own SMRs (Small Modular Nuclear Reactors) or massive solar farms with battery storage, effectively taking their ball and going home.

Sovereign Compute: Nations will realize that ""compute"" is a strategic resource like oil. You will see countries hoarding power to feed their own AI models rather than exporting it.

The Efficiency Wall: We will hit a point where the cost of power makes brute-force AI training uneconomical, forcing a shift to ""smarter"" chips (ASICs) and maybe, eventually, neuromorphic or photonic computing.

The invisible hand is dealing cards, but the laws of thermodynamics are calling the bluff. The virtual world requires real power, and for the first time in a long time, we are realizing that ""unlimited data"" was a temporary illusion.

Hut 8 Investment Narrative Recap

To be a Hut 8 shareholder, you need to believe in the long-term adoption of digital assets, especially Bitcoin, and the company’s ability to profitably scale its energy and technology infrastructure. The sale of Hut 8's Ontario power plants signals a move away from fossil fuel-intensive assets but does not materially impact the biggest current catalyst, expansion of long-term contracted energy sites, nor does it significantly change the largest risk, which remains exposure to Bitcoin price volatility.

Of the recent announcements, the initiation of the Vega Bitcoin mining facility stands out as highly relevant. This project showcases a clear progression toward enhancing operational scale and energy efficiency, reinforcing the core investment catalyst of increasing revenue predictability through infrastructure growth, while underscoring the ongoing shift toward more sustainable operations.

By contrast, investors should be aware that reducing fossil fuel exposure, while positive for regulatory risk, does not eliminate Hut 8's dependence on...

Hut 8's narrative projects $767.3 million in revenue and $140.6 million in earnings by 2028. This requires 76.9% yearly revenue growth and a decrease of $13.4 million in earnings from $154.0 million currently.

Among other measures, the MOU pledges to “Enter into a methane equivalency agreement on or before April 1, 2026, with a 2035 target date and a 75% reduction target relative to 2014 emissions levels.”

Groups who are concerned about the climate and health impacts of methane pollution issued the following statement:

At a time when we need to move faster on climate, it is disappointing to see Canada tapping the brakes.

Oil and gas is responsible for the largest share of Canada’s emissions, and it is the industry whose emissions are rising fastest. Methane is the least expensive and easiest way to reduce these emissions at scale. It is extremely disappointing to see that Canada is failing to harvest the lowest-hanging fruit.

What’s more, this unnecessary delay will lead to more wasted energy that already totals over $2 billion since the federal methane target was announced, as well as potentially threaten the creation of tens of thousands of jobs in the growing methane mitigation industry.

In 2021, the federal Liberals promised a 75% reduction in oil and gas methane by 2030. After four years of delay in passing the regulation, the government is now proposing yet another five years of delay for its implementation.

It is five years we can’t afford to waste, given the dramatic increase in climate-related impacts such as wildfires, floods and drought, as well as an ever-widening gap between what Canada is doing to address climate change and its fair share of the GHG reductions needed.

Background

After 10 years of global leadership on oil and gas methane, this is Canada’s first major climb down on its efforts to control this pollutant that’s responsible for 30% of emissions that are causing the climate crisis.

The MOU means the federal government is failing to keep up with other jurisdictions on many fronts:

Mere weeks ago, Canada and several allies (e.g., the UK, Japan, Germany and France) agreed to a near-zero oil and gas methane target, “including clear policies to end routine venting and flaring by 2030 and hold operators accountable.” This MOU will likely preclude Canada from meeting this recent commitment.

BC has committed to meet a near-zero emissions standard by 2035.

Major U.S. states like New Mexico (2nd-largest oil producing state, and 4th-largest gas producer) and Colorado (4th-largest oil producing state and 8th-largest gas producer) have had regulations in place for many years that are stronger than Canada’s draft 2030 regulation.

In May 2024, the EU approved new import standards on natural gas for 2030. (This would apply to potential LNG imports from Canada.)

Asian countries including Japan and South Korea have already taken steps to improve supply chain transparency of methane emissions for LNG exporting countries, signaling a preference for low-emission energy.

The Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI) — comprised of 12 of the world’s largest oil and gas companies that represent more than 40% of global oil and gas production — recommitted, in January 2025, to reducing climate emissions, including by pursuing a near-zero methane emissions by 2030.

Experts said that it has had a ripple effect on sales in the auto industry.

As the clock ticked on the expiration of EV tax credits in September, new data shows there was a wave of last-minute buyers.

But, since then, new electric auto sales across the board plummeted nearly 50% last month.

""I think in the next probably six months, the market will get stabilized and really try to find that balance of what's that natural demand for EVs,"" said Stephanie Valdez-Streaty.

Valdez-Streaty is a director for Cox Automotive, which provides marketing data for the automotive industry.

""I think the used EV market is the bright star,"" she said.

For example, new Rivian trucks can cost north of $100,000, but you can get a used one for south of $60,000.

And a new Tesla Model ""Y"" averages around $50,000, but the 2024 model can be found for around $30,000.

She said that currently, EVs only account for about 2.5% of the overall used vehicle sales market. But she added that since 2023, 1.1 million EVs have been leased, and many will expire soon.

That surge of expiring leases is bringing used prices down and allowing for big bargains.

""I think it's going to be a huge opportunity and huge growth engine in the next few years,"" she said.

Valdezy-Streaty said wider EV adoption has been hindered by price, battery concerns, and trepidation about an insufficient charging infrastructure. But she stressed batteries are good and warranties on them are robust. He believes the technology will only improve and likely bring costs down even further, especially in the new car sales market.

The Lynas Texas project in limbo exemplifies broader tensions between economic efficiency and strategic autonomy that characterise contemporary critical mineral markets.","Strategic Mining Developments Reshape Critical Mineral Supply Networks

The global rare earth processing landscape undergoes fundamental transformation as geopolitical priorities increasingly override traditional market efficiency considerations. With China maintaining dominance over approximately 60-70% of global rare earth processing capacity according to the International Energy Agency's Critical Minerals Market Review, Western nations face mounting pressure to establish independent supply chains for materials essential to modern defense systems, renewable energy infrastructure, and advanced manufacturing. Furthermore, the establishment of a critical minerals reserve has become a strategic imperative for many nations seeking supply chain independence.

Heavy rare earth elements such as dysprosium and terbium represent particularly critical strategic materials due to their irreplaceable roles in high-temperature permanent magnets, military-grade systems, and aerospace applications. The U.S. Department of Energy's Critical Materials Strategy identifies dysprosium as one of the highest-priority rare earth elements for national security applications, yet domestic processing capability remains virtually nonexistent.

This strategic vulnerability has catalysed unprecedented government intervention in rare earth markets, fundamentally altering competitive dynamics and investment patterns across the sector. The implications extend far beyond individual projects to encompass broader questions about industrial policy coordination, supply chain resilience, and the balance between strategic autonomy and economic efficiency.

Industrial Infrastructure Dependencies Create Strategic Vulnerabilities

The complexity of establishing rare earth processing capabilities in Western markets extends beyond technical challenges to encompass regulatory coordination failures and infrastructure dependencies that create systemic vulnerabilities. These factors have converged to create significant obstacles for foreign operators seeking to establish processing facilities in strategic markets.

Wastewater Treatment Partnership Collapse Exposes Coordination Gaps

The February 2025 withdrawal of Dow Chemical's permit amendment application for wastewater treatment partnership revealed critical weaknesses in U.S. industrial policy implementation. This regulatory setback directly impacted the Lynas Texas project in limbo, as the planned Seadrift facility required Dow's industrial wastewater processing infrastructure to meet environmental compliance standards for Texas operations.

Rare earth processing generates acidic wastewater containing lanthanides and other chemical residues requiring sophisticated treatment protocols including pH neutralisation, rare earth element recovery, and heavy metal removal. The Lynas partnership strategy leveraged existing industrial infrastructure rather than constructing dedicated treatment facilities, reducing capital requirements but creating operational dependencies that proved vulnerable to regulatory shifts.

Critical Timeline Breakdown:

2021-2023: U.S. Department of Defense allocated $288 million in funding to support project development

2024: Offtake agreement negotiations with DoD began experiencing delays

February 2025: Dow Chemical permit withdrawal created regulatory bottleneck

August 2025: CEO Amanda Lacaze signalled project uncertainty in earnings communications

November 2025: Project status remains unlikely to proceed under current conditions

The regulatory infrastructure misalignment exposed fundamental coordination gaps between federal strategic objectives and state-level environmental permitting processes. While DoD funding commitment demonstrated federal support for supply chain diversification, Environmental Protection Agency and Texas state regulatory frameworks created contradictory incentives that undermined project viability.

Government Partnership Preferences Reshape Competitive Landscape

Washington's July 2025 strategic pivot toward MP Materials fundamentally altered rare earth processing competition through unprecedented government support mechanisms. The multibillion-dollar partnership elevated the U.S. government to MP Materials' top shareholder position whilst providing price floor guarantees and $150 million loan commitments for heavy rare earth separation expansion.

Comparative Government Support Analysis:

Company Government Investment Equity Position Production Guarantees Heavy RE Capability MP Materials $150M+ loans Top shareholder Price floor guaranteed Expansion planned Lynas (Texas) $288M DoD funding None Offtake negotiations stalled Primary strategic focus

This support package created asymmetric competitive advantages that foreign operators cannot overcome through market mechanisms alone. MP Materials operates the Mountain Pass facility in California, representing the only active rare earth mining and processing operation in the continental United States, providing both operational experience and domestic political advantages.

The policy preference shift reflects explicit prioritisation of wholly U.S.-based critical minerals infrastructure over foreign partnerships, regardless of comparative operational efficiency or technological maturity. Moreover, recent developments surrounding the critical minerals order have further emphasised the strategic importance of domestic supply chains.

Alternative Supply Chain Architecture Emerges

The stalling of major Western processing projects accelerates development of alternative supply chain configurations that bypass traditional geographic and regulatory constraints. These emerging models demonstrate how market participants adapt strategic approaches when conventional pathways encounter systematic obstacles.

Malaysia-Focused Processing Strategy Gains Momentum

Lynas Corporation's strategic recalibration toward Malaysian operations represents the most viable near-term pathway for maintaining Western supply chain independence. The company's Kuantan facility, operational since 2014, processes Mount Weld concentrate from Western Australia using established solvent extraction technology for both light and heavy rare earth separation.

Operational Advantages of Malaysian Expansion:

Established infrastructure eliminates greenfield capital expenditure risk

Proven regulatory compliance framework reduces permitting timelines

Lower operational costs relative to U.S. industrial wage structures

Existing processing capabilities for dysprosium, terbium, and other strategic elements

CEO Amanda Lacaze indicated in August 2025 earnings communications that the company will prioritise expanding Malaysian processing capacity rather than pursuing unfavourable U.S. arrangements. This approach leverages existing infrastructure investments whilst securing long-term offtake agreements with private-sector customers rather than relying exclusively on government procurement.

The geographic supply chain extends from Mount Weld mining operations in Western Australia through Kuantan processing facilities to end-user markets across Asia, Europe, and North America. While transportation distances to U.S. West Coast ports exceed 6,000 nautical miles, established logistics networks and operational experience provide supply chain reliability advantages over greenfield development projects.

Accelerated Domestic Processing Development Pathways

The Pentagon's increasing focus on supply chain resilience through Defense Logistics Agency strategic materials programmes has catalysed expanded private sector investment in domestic rare earth processing capabilities. Multiple U.S. states have initiated critical minerals processing incentive programmes, including Texas state-level tax incentives, Colorado processing development support, and Wyoming rare earth infrastructure initiatives.

Technology Transfer and Innovation Acceleration:

Venture capital investment in rare earth separation technologies increases following foreign project delays

Defence contractors secure direct rare earth procurement partnerships with domestic suppliers

Research focus shifts toward alternative processing technologies including supercritical fluid extraction and ionic liquid-based separation methods

Recycling technology development gains priority for recovering rare earths from end-of-life permanent magnets and electronics

Defence procurement agencies historically prioritise supply security over cost optimisation, reflecting institutional preferences for vertical integration and domestic control over efficiency considerations. This approach may accelerate domestic processing development by reducing foreign technology dependencies and incentivising proprietary U.S. processing innovations.

Geopolitical Supply Chain Fragmentation Accelerates

The convergence of strategic competition and industrial policy preferences drives fundamental restructuring of global rare earth markets toward regionalised supply chains that prioritise geopolitical alignment over economic optimisation. Consequently, this transformation affects investment flows, technological development priorities, and long-term market structure, particularly as US‑China trade war impacts continue to reshape global commerce.

Regional Bloc Formation Patterns

Critical mineral supply chains increasingly organise around geopolitical spheres rather than purely economic considerations, creating distinct processing and distribution networks aligned with strategic partnerships.

Emerging Regional Configurations:

Western Alliance: Australia-Malaysia-U.S. processing corridor with shared security frameworks

Chinese Integration: Vertically integrated mining-to-magnet supply chain encompassing domestic and partner nation operations

Alternative Partnerships: Saudi Arabia processing arrangements and African mineral development projects create additional supply options

The U.S. government's recent announcement of major processing outsourcing arrangements with Saudi Arabia demonstrates how strategic partnerships extend beyond traditional alliance structures when critical material access requires diversification. These developments suggest that supply chain security considerations now override conventional trade relationship patterns.

Investment Capital Reallocation Dynamics

Capital previously allocated toward cross-border processing partnerships increasingly flows toward domestic champions or alternative technologies that reduce strategic material dependencies. This reallocation affects both public and private investment priorities across the rare earth value chain.

Investment Flow Redirection Indicators:

Government funding consolidates behind domestic operators with equity participation

Private equity and venture capital increase investment in rare earth recycling and alternative separation technologies

Defence contractors develop direct supplier relationships that bypass traditional commodity markets

Sovereign wealth funds prioritise critical mineral assets within allied nation jurisdictions

The investment reallocation reflects broader recognition that rare earth supply chains represent strategic infrastructure requiring long-term planning horizons that exceed typical market-based investment cycles. This approach may reduce short-term efficiency whilst building resilience against supply disruption scenarios.

Investment Strategy Implications for Rare Earth Exposure

Market participants must navigate increasingly complex risk environments where geopolitical considerations fundamentally alter traditional investment evaluation frameworks. The intersection of industrial policy and strategic competition creates both opportunities and vulnerabilities that require sophisticated analysis approaches.

Portfolio Risk Assessment Framework

Direct Investment Considerations:

Lynas Corporation faces strategic pivot requirements following U.S. market access challenges

MP Materials benefits from reduced competition and comprehensive government backing

Downstream manufacturers encounter potential supply chain disruption risks

Alternative technology developers gain strategic importance through government prioritisation

Sector-Wide Risk Evaluation Matrix:

Risk Category Impact Level Mitigation Strategies Supply Disruption High Diversified sourcing, strategic stockpiles Geopolitical Shifts Medium-High Multi-jurisdiction operations Technology Obsolescence Medium R&D investment, recycling capabilities Regulatory Changes High Compliance infrastructure, government relations

The evaluation framework must account for non-market factors including government policy preferences, strategic partnership evolution, and technological development priorities that increasingly influence commercial outcomes. Additionally, developments in energy transition minerals continue to reshape investment priorities across the sector.

Market Psychology and Behavioural Dynamics

Investor sentiment toward rare earth investments reflects broader uncertainty about the balance between strategic autonomy and economic efficiency in critical material markets. Government intervention through equity participation and price guarantees creates market distortions that complicate valuation methodologies whilst potentially reducing private sector risk exposure.

Behavioural Investment Patterns:

Flight to quality favours companies with government backing over technically superior alternatives

Strategic premium valuations emerge for domestic processing capabilities regardless of cost structures

Private sector partnerships with defence contractors command valuation premiums

International operators face systematic valuation discounts despite operational advantages

These psychological factors suggest that traditional fundamental analysis approaches require modification to account for policy preference impacts on competitive positioning and long-term profitability prospects.

Long-Term Strategic Market Evolution

The current period of supply chain restructuring establishes precedents and institutional frameworks that will influence rare earth markets throughout the remainder of the decade and beyond. Understanding these trajectory implications provides essential context for long-term investment planning and policy development.

Industrial Policy Integration with National Security Planning

The Lynas Texas project in limbo experience demonstrates how critical mineral supply chain development increasingly integrates national security planning with industrial policy implementation. This integration creates permanent changes in how government agencies evaluate and support private sector projects in strategic material sectors.

Policy Evolution Indicators:

Expanded use of Defense Production Act authorities for critical mineral infrastructure

Integration of supply chain considerations into defence procurement planning cycles

Increased screening of foreign investment in rare earth and critical mineral sectors

Development of strategic reserves and stockpile management programmes

Future rare earth processing projects will likely face enhanced scrutiny regarding ownership structure, technology transfer implications, and supply chain resilience contributions. This regulatory environment favours domestic operators whilst creating additional compliance requirements for international partnerships.

Technology Development and Innovation Priorities

Supply chain diversification pressures accelerate research and development investment in alternative rare earth processing technologies, recycling capabilities, and substitute materials that reduce strategic dependencies. Government funding priorities increasingly support these innovation pathways as strategic priorities rather than purely commercial ventures.

Innovation Acceleration Areas:

Advanced separation technologies that reduce processing complexity and environmental impact

Recycling systems for permanent magnet and electronics applications

Alternative magnet compositions that reduce heavy rare earth requirements

Supply chain traceability and verification systems for strategic material sourcing

The technological development trajectory suggests that current supply chain challenges may catalyse innovations that fundamentally alter rare earth market structures over longer time horizons. Furthermore, broader trends in mining industry innovation are creating new opportunities for efficiency gains across the sector.

Strategic Landscape Navigation Framework

The resolution of supply chain restructuring challenges will significantly influence global rare earth market development through 2030 and beyond. Market participants require comprehensive analysis frameworks that integrate geopolitical risk assessment with traditional financial evaluation methodologies.

The Lynas Texas project in limbo exemplifies broader tensions between economic efficiency and strategic autonomy that characterise contemporary critical mineral markets. Whilst immediate impacts focus on heavy rare earth processing capacity, longer-term implications encompass fundamental questions about industrial policy coordination and supply chain resilience in strategic material sectors.

Key Strategic Considerations:

Government policy preferences increasingly override pure market efficiency considerations

Supply chain regionalisation creates both opportunities and vulnerabilities for international operators

Technology development acceleration may fundamentally alter market structures within current planning horizons

Investment evaluation frameworks require integration of geopolitical risk assessment with financial analysis

The ultimate resolution of current supply chain challenges will establish precedents that influence critical mineral market development throughout the coming decade. Whether through alternative processing pathways, policy coordination improvements, or technological innovations, the outcome will significantly affect global rare earth market trajectory and investment opportunity structures.

Market participants who successfully navigate this transition period by developing sophisticated risk assessment capabilities and strategic positioning approaches will be best positioned to capitalise on opportunities created by supply chain restructuring whilst avoiding vulnerabilities associated with geopolitical market fragmentation. However, the evolving landscape requires continuous adaptation to changing regulatory frameworks and international partnership dynamics.

Greeting the Mayor were Highview’s CEO Richard Butland and Chairman, Colin Roy, who also welcomed Andrew Western, MP for Stretford and Urmston.

The Carrington plant will deliver 300 MWh of storage and an output of 50 MW for six hours, enough clean, renewable energy to serve 480,000 homes. The facility will connect to existing substation and transmission infrastructure in the local area and will also include a stability island, designed to stabilise the local grid, ensuring energy security against outages and blackouts.

Speaking at the ceremony, Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, said: “Storing renewable power so it’s there when people need it will be essential for Greater Manchester in the years ahead. This project is an important step in that direction, and it’s already supporting jobs and skills in the area through its construction and supply chain. It’s also significant that this is the first development on the Trafford Low Carbon Energy Park, setting the tone for what we hope will become a major centre for clean energy in Greater Manchester.”

Highview’s liquid air energy storage system captures excess renewable energy when demand is low, and stores it as liquid air, for hours, days, or even weeks. When it is needed, the air is expanded to generate electricity, delivering 100% clean, dispatchable power.

Unlike other storage technologies, LAES can operate without degradation for between 40 and 50 years and is fully locatable and modular. It is ideal for firming intermittent renewables, reducing curtailment and supporting the transition from fossil fuels to wind and solar.

Highview last year raised £300 million from the National Wealth Fund, Centrica, and a syndicate of investors including Rio Tinto, Goldman Sachs, KIRKBI and Mosaic Capital to build the plant at Carrington.

Richard Butland, CEO at Highview commented: “This is a hugely important moment for Highview, as we kick-start work on our first LAES facility in Carrington, and we are delighted that Mayor Andy Burnham and Andrew Western MP were with us to mark the occasion. This site is the first in our planned program of energy storage plants across the UK, and we expect the first phase to be up and running by the second half of next year.

BBC News reports that the new EV tax is about half the fuel-duty rate paid by drivers of petrol cars.
There were smaller emissions reductions from underground coalmines, heavy industry, farming and households burning gas for heating and cooking.
However, it adds that the country is not on track for its 2035 goal of cutting emissions by 62-70%.
The Guardian reports that temperatures in Queensland and northern New South Wales will remain up to 8C above average up to next week.","There is widespread UK media coverage of the Labour government’s new budget, which was announced by chancellor Rachel Reeves yesterday. The Guardian reports that electric vehicles will face a 3p-per-mile charge from 2028. According to the newspaper, Reeves “pledged to accelerate the rollout of public EV charging and exemptions from business rates, but disappointed some by not lowering VAT on public charging to meet the domestic rates for electricity”. It adds: “The new EV pay-per-mile charge is expected to raise £1.1bn in 2028-29, rising to £1.9bn in 2030-31. Electric vans, buses and HGVs will not be liable.” Bloomberg reports that, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility, “the change will lead to 440,000 fewer electric car sales over the coming years”. BBC News reports that the new EV tax is about half the fuel-duty rate paid by drivers of petrol cars. The Financial Times reports that fuel duty will increase from September, for the first time in more than 15 years. It says: “Fuel duty, which at present is 52.95p per litre for petrol and diesel, is supposed to rise every year in line with inflation, but the last increase came into effect on January 1 2011 as successive chancellors curried favour with motorists.” (See Carbon Brief’s analysis of the emissions impact of this long-term freeze.)

Bloomberg reports that Reeves is implementing measures to cut annual energy bills by £150 per household on average, by “cutting some green levies that support renewable electricity and abolishing a scheme funding home efficiency upgrades”. The outlet says: “Labour has promised to cut energy bills by £300 over the course of this parliament, banking on renewable generation to provide cheaper energy for the country. Chancellor Rachel Reeves plans to shift 75% of the cost that energy suppliers pay for renewable electricity certificates from customers’ bills to general taxation saving an average of £2.3bn a year, according to Treasury documents.” BusinessGreen reports that Reeves is also scrapping the Energy Company Obligation (ECO) energy efficiency scheme. The Daily Mail quotes Reeves, who said: “[The ECO] costs households £1.7bn a year on their bills and for 97% of families in fuel poverty, the scheme has cost them more than it has saved. It is a failed scheme.” The newspaper adds that Reeves “also increased funding for the warm homes plan by £1.5bn to ensure those households don’t lose out”. Separately, BusinessGreen says: “Green groups warn [the] decision to axe ECO energy efficiency scheme and plans for [the] new pay-per-mile EV levy are sending mixed signals to the green economy.”

The government has released a strategy paper, confirming its intention “ban drilling licences and end offshore exploration in new oil and gas fields in the North Sea”, reports BusinessGreen. The outlet continues: “Published in response to a consultation on the future of the UK’s energy sector, the North Sea Future Plan aims to make good on Labour’s manifesto pledge to halt the issuance of licenses for new oil and gas field, while also confirming an end to new onshore licences in England in support of a commitment to end fracking. The government said the plan would implement the manifesto promise to manage existing fields for the entirety of their lifespan and not issue new licences to explore new oil and gas fields. However, it also confirms the government will allow new drilling that is either in or connected to existing fields.” The Guardian says: “The government hopes that by allowing ‘tie-back’ projects that are linked to existing schemes it can strike a balance between protecting thousands of North Sea jobs and meeting the UK’s climate commitments.” The newspaper adds the government will maintain the windfall tax on oil and gas producers. It says: “Greenpeace said that holding firm on the oil and gas windfall tax, despite fierce industry lobbying, would support the transition to clean energy.” The Financial Times reports that trade group Offshore Energies UK “criticised the government’s decision not to end the windfall tax on oil and gas drillers, which it warned was leading to cuts in investment and jobs”.

MORE ON OIL AND GAS

The Financial Times reports that the National Energy System Operator has warned that there is a risk of gas shortages in the UK, if the UK moves to lower carbon energy “slower than planned”. The newspaper continues: “While supplies were expected to be sufficient to meet demand under normal weather conditions, stress testing for poor conditions had revealed an ‘emerging risk to gas supply security’ in the early 2030s, it said.”

Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions fell by 2.2% last financial year, the Guardian reports. The newspaper continues: “About half of the 9.9m tonnes reduction was due to an increase in solar and wind generation pushing coal-fired power out of the system, according to new government data to be released on Thursday. Pollution from power generation dropped 3.3%, or 5m tonnes, as the proportion of electricity from renewable energy across the year reached more than 40%. It reversed a brief rise in climate pollution from the power sector in the previous year. There were smaller emissions reductions from underground coalmines, heavy industry, farming and households burning gas for heating and cooking. But pollution from transport continued to increase due to greater use of diesel-power vehicles and more people taking domestic flights.” Reuters reports that Australia is on track to cut emissions by 42% from 2005 levels by 2030, in line with the government’s target. However, it adds that the country is not on track for its 2035 goal of cutting emissions by 62-70%. Bloomberg notes that the forecast “doesn’t take into account new action planned under the nation’s net-zero plan”. Agence France-Presse says that climate change and energy minister Chris Bowen told parliament that it was “normal” to have a gap between projections and a decade-long target.

MORE ON AUSTRALIA

Bloomberg reports that Australia is “set to pass a landmark bill that will overhaul its environmental laws” after the Labor government struck a deal to secure support from the Green party. BBC News says: “The changes include more protections for native forests, stricter rules for land clearing and a limit on fast-tracking of coal and gas projects but critics say more is needed.”

Former US secretary of state John Kerry is calling on Australia to “gather the world’s 25 biggest greenhouse gas emitting countries and push them to draw up a roadmap to end the era of fossil fuels” ahead of COP31, the Guardian reports.

Bloomberg says that some parts of Australia are “at risk of elevated [fire] danger after persistently warmer-than-average conditions dried the landscape throughout much of 2025”.

The Guardian reports that temperatures in Queensland and northern New South Wales will remain up to 8C above average up to next week.

Around 200 retail electricity companies across China exited the country’s power market between August and October this year due to increased “regulatory oversight”, business news outlet Jiemian reports, citing calculations by industry outlet BJX News. It notes that interprovincial power transmission and market-based pricing reform for renewables have brought both “new opportunities” and “greater challenges” for power generators, adding that “intense low-price competition among new energy sources has driven electricity prices down”. The outlet quotes an unnamed manager at a private electricity company saying that profitability has “become difficult” for many retailers.

Meanwhile, power news outlet Dianlian Xinmei publishes an article by He Yang, deputy director at the National Energy Administration, on the need for managing “power reliability”, arguing that China’s energy transition means ensuring reliability is a “significant responsibility” and “faces new challenges” requiring “innovative” solutions. It says renewable energy is “characterised by high uncertainty and low controllability”, increasing volatility and “making the supply-demand situation increasingly complex”. China’s data also currently “only covers medium-voltage users”, with only 36% of wind power and 14% of solar power represented in statistics, making it “difficult to accurately reflect” the actual user experience, it adds.

MORE ON CHINA

An article in the print edition of People’s Daily says COP30 “injected confidence and momentum” into climate action. Xinhua says “Xi [Jinping] takes China to [the] forefront of global climate governance.”

The recent trend of Chinese manufacturers building “ever-larger wind turbines” may slow due to insufficient data, lengthy required testing time and challenges transporting blades, Bloomberg reports.

China has banned manufacturing products such as refrigerators or freezers that use certain super-pollutants, including for export, reports Science and Technology Daily.

The UK plans on stockpiling critical minerals widely used in sectors such as electric vehicles (EVs), to reduce its reliance on China, Reuters reports.

Xinhua says China is developing new ways to extract “dispersed” minerals, such as gallium and germanium, from sources such as coal and copper.

Volkswagen says the EVs it makes entirely in China can be “half the cost” of those it makes elsewhere, Financial Times reports. An article in Global Times under the byline “GT Voice” says “protectionist traps” that raise the price of EVs would be “counterproductive” for the EU.

Adam Morton, the Guardian Australia’s climate and environment editor, writes that “the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act changes are an improvement, but the rush to pass them was purely political”. Morton lists benefits of the deal. For example, he says “the creation of a national Environment Protection Agency with the power to enforce compliance and apply beefed-up penalties is a step forward”. He adds: “The commitment to tighten loopholes that made state-sanctioned native forest logging and agricultural land-clearing effectively exempt from national laws is a significant and necessary win for nature…The Greens’ demand that fossil-fuel projects cannot be fast-tracked in the way other developments can – renewable energy and housing, for example – makes obvious sense as far as it goes.” However, he says the new laws “lean heavily on the use of offsets”, noting that these schemes “have repeatedly not delivered anything like what has been promised”. He concludes: “Finally, the laws go close to ignoring what will ultimately be the greatest threat to much of the environment – the climate crisis. Developers will have to disclose their expected emissions, but this information will have no bearing on whether a project goes ahead.”

Many Democrats and Republicans alike have expressed support for the build-out of data centers, though Democrats have been more likely to back some restrictions on the technology.
Experts say that technology and data centers are expected to have massive impacts on the electric grid in the years ahead.
Meanwhile, the government is also warning of potential issues in the future due to data centers.
Meanwhile, environmental advocates see a problem not only for climate change but also for clean air, especially as some data centers use diesel-powered backup generators.","The Trump administration’s data center push is spurring concerns about energy prices and environmental impacts.

The administration has embraced data centers, which house the computers and infrastructure used by tech companies, including for artificial intelligence, as well as the AI they power.

White House officials argue it’s important for the U.S. to win the global “AI race” and outcompete rivals including China in the emerging tech space.

Just this week, President Trump announced a new initiative seeking to expand AI’s use in scientific research. The administration is also considering a move to block “onerous” state-level regulations on AI.

Earlier this year, the administration also floated shielding data centers from environmental impact scrutiny and fast-tracking approvals of the centers and associated energy projects as part of its AI framework.

And they are not alone. Many Democrats and Republicans alike have expressed support for the build-out of data centers, though Democrats have been more likely to back some restrictions on the technology.

Experts say that technology and data centers are expected to have massive impacts on the electric grid in the years ahead.

“Utilities are expecting a lot of this load to land around 2030,” said Ben Hertz-Shargel, who leads research about the electric grid at Wood Mackenzie.

“That is the period when the reliability uncertainty will come to a head, and that’s when things will get tighter. So I think it’s that time frame … of three to five years from now that we’re looking at to start seeing the material cost and potentially reliability impacts of AI demand,” Hertz-Shargel said.

Electricity prices are also relatively high at the moment. In September, electricity prices were about 5.1 percent higher than they were a year ago, outpacing general inflation, which was at 3 percent.

Hertz-Shargel said that prices are currently high for other reasons, including the aging electric grid and extreme weather that creates storm damage.

Meanwhile, the government is also warning of potential issues in the future due to data centers.

An Energy Department report from July said that increasing power demand, including from AI, was increasing risks of blackouts.

The Energy Information Administration, the nation’s independent energy statistics agency, has forecast new highs in electricity usage in 2025 and 2026, saying increases in the commercial sector will be driven “largely by more demand from data centers.”

The Trump administration has argued that data centers can actually help bring down electricity prices over time.

Asked about the issue, a White House official recently told reporters that the additional infrastructure needed to power data centers will ultimately lead to more supply of electricity and power lines, and therefore lower prices in the long term.

Hertz-Shargel said that this can be true in “limited situations” but that overall, data centers are expected to raise prices.

He said that in these limited cases, data centers “consume power when others are not and that does allow better utilization of grid infrastructure, which can, in certain cases, lower energy prices for a certain amount of data center and demand contribution.”

“However, once you get to anywhere near the levels of demand … that are being planned for, you’re way past that regime, and you’re in a regime where now utilities are needed to build much bigger and newer and much more expensive infrastructure, including expensive gas plants … so you’re spending much more money and you’re significantly raising the cost of electricity, both the cost of the electricity itself as a commodity and also the cost of the infrastructure that must be recovered,” he added.

Higher demand, and therefore higher prices, are expected to keep more fossil fuels, particularly coal and natural gas, on the grid for more time. In the case of gas, the increased demand is likely to result in more investment.

“It looks like we have a setback in our climate and decarbonization trajectory here, as we build a lot of new gas plants and some pipeline capacity and drill more. It looks like our emissions are going to go up for a while and old coal plants are being retained on the system,” said Rob Gramlich, founder and president of consulting firm Grid Strategies LLC.

Grid Strategies has recently projected that electricity demand in 2030 could grow massively over the next several years, with 55 percent of the demand increase coming from data centers.

Hertz-Shargel agreed that a data center boom could increase the nation’s planet-warming emissions, particularly through the expansion of gas plants.

“There always was going to be some degree of natural gas build, but it is far greater than it would have been,” he said, noting that there have been “commitments by some of the natural gas turbine manufacturers to increase their production capacity to satisfy this need.”

However, others, including those who are more supportive of data centers, argue that the build-out could make other, lower-emissions technologies such as nuclear energy cheaper and easier to scale in the long run.

“For nuclear to become a really important energy source and help to address climate, it has to scale up, and in order to scale up, it has to get the first reactors built and then start building an order book quickly,” said Robin Gaster, research director at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation’s center for clean energy innovation. The foundation has received donations from tech companies, among others.

“Data centers can provide the demand that will get nuclear over the hump,” Gaster added.

Meanwhile, environmental advocates see a problem not only for climate change but also for clean air, especially as some data centers use diesel-powered backup generators.

“For these diesel backup generators, it’s very high emissions for soot particulates and sometimes even mercury [and] sulfur dioxide,” Jeremy Fisher, a principal adviser for climate and energy at the Sierra Club, told The Hill last month.

Mercury is a neurotoxin; soot can cause premature death, heart attacks and asthma; and sulfur dioxide can harm the respiratory system.

“No other industry compares with the amount of backup generation that these data centers insist on having on site, so it becomes a very local pollution issue,” Fisher said.

China has a near-monopoly over rare earth mining (70%), refining (85%), and magnet production (90%), creating critical vulnerability for automakers.

Recent export controls by China have caused production disruptions at Ford and inventory depletion across Tier-1 suppliers.

Electric vehicles require 3-5 kg of NdFeB magnets per vehicle, which is 30-50 times more than conventional cars.

94% of EV traction motors still depend on rare earth permanent magnets, even though some automakers are exploring magnet-free alternatives.

A projected 70,000-100,000 tonne NdPr deficit by 2035 is driving automakers to:

Diversify through upstream investments such as the GM-MP Materials partnership.

Pay premiums of 10-30% for non-Chinese supply.

Develop AI-optimized designs that reduce rare earth intensity by 24%.

The global automotive industry is deeply intertwined with rare earth elements (REEs) — from the metals mined out of the ground to the permanent magnets that power modern vehicles. These 17 specialty metals (including neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, and terbium) are tiny in volume but outsized in importance. They enable essential components across both electric and conventional vehicles, yet their supply chain is alarmingly concentrated.

Automakers (OEMs) and their Tier-1 suppliers (the companies that make motors, actuators, electronics, and major subsystems) now face a stark reality: China’s near-monopoly over rare earth mining, processing, and magnet production presents a strategic vulnerability. This article summarizes at a high level the industry’s dependence on rare earth-based products, how OEMs and suppliers procure these critical materials, and the risks and responses shaping the road ahead.

Rare Earths in Cars: Essential and Everywhere

Rare earth elements sit quietly behind many features in today’s vehicles. NdFeB rare-earth magnets enable small electric motors that power mirrors, seats, pumps, and sensors. A typical gas or hybrid car contains about 100 grams of REE magnets, scattered across dozens of small systems.

In electric vehicles (EVs), however, magnet demand skyrockets. Each EV typically contains 3–5 kg of NdFeB magnets, largely in the traction motor that converts electricity into motion. As of 2025, an estimated 94% of EV traction motors use permanent-magnet architectures due to their efficiency and power density.

A minority of automakers have introduced magnet-free alternatives:

BMW, Renault: externally excited synchronous motors

Mercedes, Audi: induction motors

Tesla: stated an intention for a next-generation rare-earth-free motor, though the company later clarified that complete elimination of REEs is not guaranteed.

Today, these REE-free systems remain the exception. The vast majority of EVs and hybrids still rely on rare earth magnets — anchoring global automotive growth directly to REE availability.

OEMs and Tier-1 Suppliers: Shared Dependence, Different Roles

OEMs (Ford, GM, Toyota, Volkswagen, etc.) ultimately need REE-based components for their vehicles. Tier-1 suppliers (Bosch, ZF, Denso, BorgWarner, Marelli, Schaeffler) are the ones integrating magnets into motors and electronics. Together, they have long depended on China.

As of 2025:

70% of global REE mining occurs in China

85% of refining capacity sits in China

~90% of REE alloys and magnets are made in China

This dominance delivered low-cost supply for decades. But it also created a single-point-of-failure risk. A senior Toyota North America sourcing executive was quoted in industry accounts saying China could “shut us down in two months.” That comment reflects a pervasive fear among OEMs: Beijing’s policy decisions could halt production in Detroit or Stuttgart.

This fear became real in 2025. When China tightened export rules and licensing requirements for key magnet materials, supply slowed to a trickle. According to Reuters, Ford experienced production disruptions at its Chicago SUV facility due to rare earth magnet shortages — with CEO Jim Farley describing operations as “hand-to-mouth.” Tier-1 suppliers for Hyundai reported that inventories “had already been depleted,” demonstrating how quickly shortages propagate downstream.

Procurement Strategies: From Stockpiling to Supply Chain Re-Engineering

Stockpiling & Non-China Premiums

OEMs and suppliers responded to China’s export controls by:

placing rush orders,

building buffer stocks,

and shifting purchases to Europe or ASEAN even at 10–30% premiums.

Neo Performance Materials’ new Estonia magnet plant — one of the few outside China — reported customer demand “surging overnight.” Industry sources noted that European Tier-1 suppliers, including Schaeffler, were among the early buyers. Some Korean companies say their clients now willingly pay 15–20% more for Vietnamese magnets to avoid Chinese exposure.

Upstream Investments

OEMs are also rebuilding supply chains:

GM + MP Materials: U.S. mine-to-magnet strategy in California and Texas

GM + Vacuumschmelze: additional U.S. magnet facility

Toyota: long-term partnerships with Australian REE projects and reduced-dysprosium magnet formulas

Stellantis/Ford: exploratory REE deals and startup investments

Government Intervention

The U.S. and Australia jointly backed an $8.5 billion package of critical mineral financing and commitments. Europe’s Critical Raw Materials Act is pushing for domestic magnet production. Renault is piloting REE recycling from France’s ~400,000 annual end-of-life vehicles, though recovered volumes remain small for now.

Technology Substitution

Automakers explore:

magnets using less Dy

advanced ferrites

AI-optimized designs cutting REE intensity by ~24%

rare-earth-free motor architectures for mid-2030s mass production

But NdFeB magnets still dominate for performance-critical EV applications.

China’s Near Monopolistic Leverage

China not only dominates mining and processing — it possesses the world’s largest REE reserves and decades of state-directed industrial maturity. In 2010, it cut off exports to Japan. In 2023–2025, it introduced sweeping export licensing rules. Draft rules even signaled extremely low REE-content thresholds for export review.

China also wields price power. It can depress magnet prices to keep foreign competitors unprofitable, stalling new non-Chinese mines and magnet plants. Analysts estimate NdPr needs to sustain $75–$105/kg to incentivize new supply, but China can push prices toward $60/kg to squeeze rivals.

Rising Demand, Looming Shortfalls

Some estimates lead to approximately 70,000 to 100,000-tonne NdPr deficit by 2035, roughly equivalent to China’s entire 2021 output. The IEA notes that even if current global projects succeed, China’s share may only drop to ~60% by 2030 — still overwhelming.

The U.S. could theoretically meet 95% of its magnet REE demand domestically or via allies — but only if complex separation plants, including the uncertain Lynas Texas project, actually come online.

Final Thoughts

As vehicles become high-tech electric machines, automakers must think like high-tech manufacturers securing critical inputs. Rare earths sit at the center of this transformation. For at least the next decade, OEMs and Tier-1 suppliers will be juggling:

diversification,

stockpiling,

upstream investment,

alternative technology development,

and constant geopolitical risk assessment.

The road to electrification runs straight through rare earth territory — and securing these elements is now as important as designing the cars themselves.

Pierson (19.000 dwt) briefly became stranded diagonally across the Detroit River overnight on November 26. Reports are blaming the grounding on strong winds that were disrupting shipping all along the Great Lakes overnight and into today.

Built in 1974, the vessel is part of the ""river class"" of self-unloading bulk freighters operating in the region owned currently by Rand Logistics. At 630 feet (190 meters) in length, the vessel was specifically designed to sail the winding Cuyahoga River.

The vessel loaded 18,000 tons of stone in Windsor, Ontario, Canada, and was heading for Loraine, Ohio, in the United States. CBC reports the vessel attempted to drop anchor on Wednesday evening due to the strong winds to wait out the storm. However, it reports the vessel was dragged down the Detroit River. Around 10:30 p.m. local time, the ship grounded and became stuck in a diagonal position in the river not far from downtown Detroit.

The U.S. Coast Guard reports it was notified around 1:15 a.m. this morning of the incident. It was working with the operators to review a refloating plan. Yesterday, the Coast Guard issued a warning for high winds and waves across the Great Lakes. It reported that the Welland Canal in the east connecting Lake Ontario to Lake Erie had suspended navigation due to the high winds. The canal was expected to reopen this afternoon.

Media reports spotted two tugs alongside the Pierson at midday. CBC reports the ship was freed around noon local time. It was moved to a berth for an inspection. The Coast Guard is saying that low water levels contributed to the grounding.

The reports are highlighting that it was the second grounding in less than a month in the same area of the Detroit River. At the beginning of November, the Canadian vessel Rt. Hon. Paul J. Martin had also attempted to anchor to discharge a sick crewmember. CBC reports that when the vessel tried to get back underway, it was blown off course and grounded. The low water levels were also cited in this incident.

Working on a Superfund site Tare describes Superfund sites as “extremely sensitive”, and suggests that considerable time and attention is required for an EPC to install a solar project on land with such a designation.
Instead, Tare says that the discovery of asbestos underground, while excavating the site, was a surprise that necessitated the most remedial action.
“I’d never done asbestos cleaning before,” he says, highlighting the relative rarity of unexpected asbestos pollution at a solar site.
The demand for new land for solar projects has also encouraged development of technologies to make better use of land, even water, not considered idea for solar project deployment.","Earlier this month, US independent power producer (IPP) Syncarpha Capital and engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) firm Distributed Energy Infrastructure (DEI) completed construction work at the Acton project on the site, combining 7.1MW of solar PV capacity and a co-located 4.1MW battery energy storage system (BESS).

This week, the project cleared the final milestone, receiving permission from local utility Eversource to enter operation and completing the area’s rehabilitation from chemical plant to polluted brownfield site to renewable energy project.

“Acton has successfully passed witness testing with Eversource for both PV and ESS circuits, and has received permission to operate at full capacity,” Prateek Tare, EVP and founder at DEI tells PV Tech Premium exclusively this week. “As the project begins post-energisation commissioning and testing to achieve substantial completion, we’re proud to have safely and responsibly brought this site back to life.”

The successful transformation of a Superfund site to a functional solar-plus-storage project that is a contributor of major significance to the brownfield power generation industry is good news for the US solar sector, which is aiming to significantly expand its operational capacity in the coming years, and will require far more land, and a far wider variety of land types, in order to realise these goals.

Working on a Superfund site

Tare describes Superfund sites as “extremely sensitive”, and suggests that considerable time and attention is required for an EPC to install a solar project on land with such a designation.

“Generally, projects like these are extremely sensitive,” he says. “They go through years of review before they come to fruition, so they’re sensitive with neighbours, towns and everyone. With Acton, the fact that it was a Superfund site added three or four more parties … specifically for health and safety.”

The presence of these additional parties, which include local authorities such as the Acton town planning board and the federal-level EPA, meant that the process for securing permits for the project was not necessarily more complicated, but more involved, as there were more parties to satisfy prior to the start of construction.

“Generally, for EPC practice, we have a health and safety programme, and then we create a site-specific safety plan and an environment plan for that site,” he explains. “When it comes to Superfund sites like Acton, you’ve got the town planning board, the town conservation board, the town health board, the facility itself, the state—Mass DEP—and then federal—which is EPA—and all their consultants.

“A lot of it is logical—there’s a lot of overlap sometimes in the logic—but they all have their own requirements; one says ‘test the soil every 300 cubic yards’, one will say ‘500 yards’, so you’ve got to go through that whole programme and spend a lot of effort to figure out how you’re going to do the job months and months before you set foot on site.”

Tare ads that DEI worked with “a third party” in addition to the various levels of permitting organisations, to audit the company’s own work and make sure that it was completing work to as high a standard as possible. He says that while construction at the Acton project only took about six months, working on brownfield sites in general, and Superfund sites in particular, can add to the project construction time as working at these sites tends to create more moving parts for an EPC to work through.

“You might not be able to do it at the pace that you do [for] regular greenfield sites,” he explains. “Every agency has the right intent in mind, and obviously they have the plans in place, but there are so many cooks in the kitchen, so to speak, [and] there’s only enough hours in the day to be on top of things to make sure that the project keeps moving because the project has deadlines.”

Responding to the discovery of asbestos

While the Superfund label brings additional complexities for project development, Tare notes that this was not the most challenging aspect of working on the Acton project. Indeed, even pollution stemming from the site’s original use as a chemicals plant was not a significant challenge, as DEI completed testing for poisonous gases in the area “every day”, and found nothing to impede its work.

Instead, Tare says that the discovery of asbestos underground, while excavating the site, was a surprise that necessitated the most remedial action.

“I’d never done asbestos cleaning before,” he says, highlighting the relative rarity of unexpected asbestos pollution at a solar site. “I know what it is … but as an EPC this was my first experience.

“There was a possibility—the documents in our due diligence told us that something could come up eventually—so as soon as we saw there was something here, we had the third party consultants, the testing consultants and the people who make the plan [and] we knew who we were going to go to as soon as something happened.”

Tare goes on to say that responding to the presence of asbestos did not require wholesale reconsideration of the project, but making smaller changes to the placement of electrical components and wires, putting them above ground to eliminate the need for digging into soil contaminated with asbestos to install them.

Also, looking more long-term, this placement removed the need for operations and maintenance (O&M) staff to get close to asbestos-polluted land to complete their work, as they can instead perform routine checks from the relative safety of ground level.

“Generally you try to design your way around [the challenges],” he says. “Once you have built the plant, your disturbance activities are done … so for this project we put everything above ground and put our wires in such a way that everything is above ground and visible to the O&M folks, the ones who are going to maintain this facility for 20-30 years.”

“Here, because there was no gas issue—it was a physical material issue—material selection wasn’t a big deal. We were designing for mostly above ground, you’re designing for a code and an engineering standard for that, but the pollution-specific point wasn’t an issue.”

Tare points out that actually removing the asbestos, to the point where planned work could continue, took just three days, compared to “six or seven months” to get the plans approved by all of the various stakeholders and government authorities involved in permitting the project, showing how the discovery of asbestos created a greater bureaucratic challenge than a purely engineering one.

Conversely, he notes that dealing with “abandoned buildings” at the site proved to be a greater engineering challenge than dealing with the asbestos. While the buildings themselves had been removed, many of their underground foundations remained in place, limiting the options for the deployment of components that had to be buried underground, such as racking units.

The appeal of brownfield sites

Ultimately, DEI’s work can largely be considered a success. The project has reached commercial operation, and despite delays in the construction work caused by the asbestos issue, Tare notes that Eversource gave the company a fairly “broad” timeline in which to connect the project to the grid, meaning that these delays were not critical to the project’s operation.

This success raises a question, then, as to whether other brownfield sites, and even Superfund sites, should be considered appropriate land for new solar PV installations as the US looks to dramatically increase its operational solar capacity. The trade body, the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), expects the US to add 246GW of new capacity between 2025 and 2030, meaning more land will need to be given over to solar deployments.

The demand for new land for solar projects has also encouraged development of technologies to make better use of land, even water, not considered idea for solar project deployment. In August, Noria started construction at the first US floating PV (FPV) project to use trackers, as developers look to install solar capacity on water as well as land, and in September, Sol Systems completed construction at an agrivoltaics (agriPV) project in Illinois, with agriPV emerging as an efficient way to deploy PV projects without compromising other land uses.

“Superfund sites, landfills [and] brownfields have been around … for a long while, because everyone is trying to make use of land that is unusable,” explains Tare, suggesting that the growing demand for solar capacity will require the deployment of solar projects on a greater range of land types, including brownfield and Superfund sites.

However, he notes that there are likely to be “commercial risks” associated with deployments on brownfield sites that are absent in other project types, as it will cost a developer time and money to dig into an area such as a landfill to properly assess the construction risks present at the site.

“The risks are on the developer, which is there on any project, but [is] a bit more nuanced with these brownfield sites, as you’re not working with virgin land so you’re potentially going to find stuff at the project,” says Tare. “That’s why they take so much longer to perform [inspection] too.”

Yet there is cause for optimism, as the demand for new solar projects, and the fact that, according to Tare, brownfield developments neatly sidestep some of the local opposition that can hamper greenfield developments, could generate waves of support for a new generation of solar projects.

“The good thing is that everyone wants to use the sites,” he says. “[We don’t have] some of the constraints that we have with regular farmland or sites in a town, as people generally don’t come up and say: ‘Hey, don’t take this land away!’",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/prateek-tare-headshot.jpg,N,,2025-11-27 18:01:30.035784

If nuclear projects fall behind schedule, gas will fill the gap, the Pembina report says.
The existing Ontario nuclear fleet uses Canadian uranium, but the new SMRs rely on a source elsewhere, likely the US and possibly Europe.
Pickup says wind, solar and battery storage can be built in a few years while nuclear projects often take more than a decade.
Pickup says if nuclear projects are delayed and gas usage continues to rise, Ontario will struggle to cut emissions fast enough.","“Electricity is hugely important across society and in everyone’s homes. The cost and affordability is so critical in energy,” Pickup said. “The Ontario government actually says ‘affordability first’ in their own plan, which is why it is confusing to us that there is such a big bet on nuclear projects, which today are already significantly more expensive than other options such as wind and solar.”

The Pembina report warns Ontario is “making quite a risky bet” by leaning on natural gas in the short term and new nuclear in the long term, while missing low-cost opportunities in wind, solar and energy storage.

Delays and higher costs

According to the Pembina analysis of nuclear projects worldwide, new developments have been finished an average of six years late and at double their original cost. If Ontario follows that trend, the Darlington small modular reactors (SMRs) could be delayed from 2036 to 2042 and cost more than $40 billion, instead of $20.9 billion.

“When you put that much stock in an expensive technology that also has delivery risk, the question becomes whether that is something you should be relying on for 70 per cent of your system in 2050,” Pickup told Canada’s National Observer. “To be clear, if you build a technology that delivers expensive energy, that will increase bills.”

Ontario currently gets about half its power from nuclear, about one quarter from hydro, roughly 16 per cent from gas, nine per cent from wind and just over two per cent from solar.

Electricity prices in Ontario have already risen 29 per cent this year, partly tied to nuclear spending.

More dependence on US gas

Ontario relies heavily on imported gas, with about 70 per cent coming from the US and the rest flowing through pipelines from Alberta.

“Cheaper US gas means one of the Canadian pipelines (TCMainline) runs at around half its capacity. This leaves Ontario with a difficult decision if it increases gas use to meet short-term electricity needs,” the report says. “It can either import more gas from the US, which risks energy security during a time of uncertain trade relations, or increase the flow through the Canadian pipeline, which would raise costs for consumers and industry.”

Greater use of gas also brings more price volatility because gas costs swing with global markets.

If nuclear projects fall behind schedule, gas will fill the gap, the Pembina report says. That would raise emissions and extend dependence on imported fuel. In a worst-case scenario, Ontario could still be using as much gas in 2050 as it does in 2030.

The existing Ontario nuclear fleet uses Canadian uranium, but the new SMRs rely on a source elsewhere, likely the US and possibly Europe. “We are essentially locking in for 60 plus years importing fuel to power our growth and power the province’s economic engines,” Pickup said.

Missed chances on renewables

The Pembina analysis says Ontario is overlooking major chances to expand low-cost renewables. Solar costs have fallen 88 per cent since 2009 and wind costs have dropped 74 per cent, it added.

Pickup says wind, solar and battery storage can be built in a few years while nuclear projects often take more than a decade. He also says renewables strengthen energy independence because they do not rely on imported fuel.

“You compare that to something like wind and solar where, yes, you do have to import the technology, but then the systems are going to run for 30 plus years without any imports of any fuel,” he said.

The province’s plan says the role of renewables will grow over time. Starting in 2025, Ontario will add nearly 3,000 megawatts of energy storage.

The government plan argues nuclear power is more cost-effective and land-efficient than wind and solar, but analysis from the Ontario Clean Air Alliance says solar does not need large areas of land. More than half of Toronto’s electricity needs could be met with rooftop and parking lot solar alone.

Studies show electricity from new nuclear reactors could cost up to eight times more than onshore wind, almost six times more than solar and about 2.7 times more than offshore wind in the Great Lakes.

Pickup says if nuclear projects are delayed and gas usage continues to rise, Ontario will struggle to cut emissions fast enough.

The Pembina report recommends opening the door to more private sector investment in clean power.

The scene raised a question back home in California: Why did Newsom recently veto climate solutions that would have made electricity cleaner and more affordable for Californians?

For decades, California has shown the world that states and regions can drive climate and economic progress, even when national governments lag.

Now the world’s fourth-largest economy, our state has paired consistent cuts in emissions with sustained economic growth and set a standard for clean car rules that is copied worldwide. It also built the nation’s first economy-wide “Cap and Invest” program, the cap-and-trade energy credit program recently reformed and extended under Newsom’s watch.

Yet as the climate crisis escalates, even that legacy faces scrutiny. While Newsom was preparing for COP30, his administration was delaying or diluting key domestic reforms and quietly expanding in-state oil and gas drilling.

In Brazil, Newsom urged fellow Democrats to start framing climate as an affordability issue — of course, it is. This rhetoric earned him praise abroad.

But Newsom has balked at several recent opportunities to address climate and cost-of-living challenges together.

Just weeks ago, the governor vetoed three bipartisan bills that would have advanced virtual power plants, which are systems that deliver clean power back to the electrical grid during peak hours by aggregating power from devices many of us already have in our homes — such as smart thermostats, rooftop solar panels, home and electric vehicle batteries and electric heat pumps.

Managing strain on the grid with virtual power plants helps avoid blackouts, reduces reliance on gas powered plants and saves electricity customers money on their utility bills, including those not participating in a virtual power plant program.

One recent study predicted virtual power plants could save Californians up to $13.7 billion on electricity over the next five years. That is the kind of climate-forward and affordability-focused policy that California voters and global climate champions want.

But all three bills were doomed because investor-owned utilities like PG&E continue to work against local-scale electricity solutions like virtual power plants, and they know they can count on Newsom as an ally.

It’s time for Newsom to start treating climate like a winning issue here in California — not just on the international stage in the lead-up to the 2028 presidential race. Investing in solutions like virtual power plants creates jobs, lowers electricity bills and builds resilience to wildfires and floods.

Californians pay twice the national average for electricity and yet still endure frequent planned blackouts. We want solutions that work, protect our families and save money, and we want our governor to champion them.

Newsom is right to emphasize affordability as a pillar of climate progress, creating further contrast between himself and President Donald Trump. That’s good politics and good policy — but it’s also puzzling when his administration vetoes the most cost-effective clean energy solutions available today.

After his time in Brazil, Newsom needs more than rhetoric to cement his legacy as a true climate champion. In his final months as governor, he should advance policies that combat the climate crisis and economic relief to hardworking Californians. Here are two ways he can show the world how to tackle climate change while lowering the cost of living.

First, knock down state barriers to local, clean, affordable energy. Newsom must stop deferring to corporate utilities like PG&E and mobilize the state to support rooftop solar, virtual power plants and other clean, decentralized electricity solutions.

Second, eliminate fossil fuel subsidies and make corporate polluters pay for climate disasters.

Why the Offshore Wind Energy Market Is Gaining Momentum

As the world intensifies its efforts to shift toward sustainable energy systems, offshore wind energy is emerging as a cornerstone of the global clean-power transition. With stronger and more consistent wind speeds offshore compared with onshore sites, wind farms at sea can deliver high-capacity electricity generation to support rising demand, while cutting greenhouse gas emissions and reducing dependence on fossil fuels.

The Offshore Wind Energy Market as defined by Acumen Research And Consulting encompasses installation of wind turbines offshore — in seas or oceans — along with all associated infrastructure. The increasing appetite for renewable power, climate-change commitments, and technological improvements make offshore wind an attractive and increasingly viable option for governments, utilities, and investors worldwide.

Offshore Wind Energy Market Size & Growth Forecast

According to the Acumen Research And Consulting report, the global Offshore Wind Energy Market was valued at approximately USD 29 billion in 2021.

Looking ahead, the offshore wind energy market is forecast to expand to USD 137 billion by 2030 — reflecting a robust compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19% over 2022-2030.

This offshore wind energy market growth trajectory points to a dramatic shift: from a relatively modest offshore wind sector to a multi-billion-dollar global industry — capable of delivering large-scale clean energy and transforming how electricity is produced and supplied.

What's Driving the Offshore Wind Energy Market Surge: Key Market Drivers

1. Rising Global Demand for Renewable Energy

With mounting concerns over climate change, pollution, and energy security, countries worldwide are accelerating their transition away from fossil fuels — boosting demand for renewable energy. Offshore wind — with its high yield and lower intermittency compared to some renewables — is becoming an integral strategy in national energy plans. The ARC report identifies ""growing investments in renewable energy"" and ""increasing global demand for renewable sources in power generation"" as primary growth drivers.

Government policies — including clean-energy targets, favorable regulation, tax credit schemes, and investment incentives — further support offshore wind deployment globally.

2. Technological Advancements in Wind Turbines & Infrastructure

Technological progress is playing a decisive role in making offshore wind more competitive. Advances in turbine design — larger rotor diameters, higher capacity units, better blades and foundations — increase energy output per installation, improve reliability, and lower levelized cost of electricity (LCoE). These improvements make offshore wind projects financially and operationally more feasible than ever before.

Furthermore, fixed-structure installations remain popular due to their lower cost and relative ease of deployment — an advantage in many shallow-water coastal regions. According to Acumen Research and Consulting, fixed-structure installations generated significant revenue in 2021 and are likely to continue dominating in the near term.

3. Deepening Investments and Capital Flows

As offshore wind becomes more attractive, both public and private investors are channeling capital into large-scale projects. This surge in funding — supported by favorable policies and long-term demand signals — is allowing for more projects to move from planning to execution, thereby accelerating capacity build-out. The growing number of planned wind farms, backed by credible funding and supply-chain momentum, feed directly into market growth and optimism.

4. Energy Transition & Decarbonization Agendas Worldwide

Countries adopting aggressive decarbonization targets see offshore wind as a key enabler to meet clean energy quotas while ensuring stable and scalable power supply. As coal and conventional thermal power phase out, offshore wind offers a powerful, renewable alternative — attracting attention from utilities, governments, and large enterprises.

Offshore Wind Energy Market Segments: Where Growth is Concentrated

By Water Depth & Installation Type

• In 2021, the ""up to 30 m water depth"" segment accounted for over 70% of the total offshore wind energy market share.

• Fixed-structure installations — typically suitable for shallower waters — generated notable revenue in 2021 and are expected to remain dominant through much of the forecast period owing to relative cost-effectiveness and simpler logistics.

These data suggest that many of the near-term growth opportunities lie in shallow-water coastal regions — especially in countries and geographies where coastline geography, economic viability, and regulatory frameworks align.

That said, as technology evolves — including floating foundations and deeper water-capable turbines — offshore wind could gradually expand into deeper water zones, opening up new geographies and vastly increasing potential capacity.

By Geography / Region

• Europe: In 2021, Europe held over 40% of the global offshore wind energy market share — making it the leading regional hub for offshore wind deployment.

• Asia-Pacific: This region is expected to record the fastest growth rate over the forecast period (2022-2030), driven by rising energy demand, expanding renewable capacity targets, and coastal geographies conducive to offshore wind deployment.

• North America, Latin America, Middle East & Africa: While these regions currently have smaller shares compared to Europe and Asia-Pacific, planned projects and evolving energy policies suggest emerging opportunities for growth as coastal jurisdictions look to diversify energy mix.

Opportunities & Market Potential: What's Next

According to the ARC analysis, several key opportunities could shape the trajectory of the offshore wind energy market in the coming years.

• Shallow-water coastal projects: Given the dominance of the up-to-30 m water depth segment, many countries with accessible shallow water near coasts stand to gain quickly from offshore wind deployment.

• Emerging economies: Rapidly industrializing regions with growing energy demand — especially in Asia-Pacific — are likely to invest heavily in offshore wind infrastructure, presenting significant growth potential.

• Advances toward deeper-water & floating offshore wind: While fixed structures will dominate in the near term, technological advances (floating platforms, deep-water foundations) may open up new areas for deployment — dramatically increasing the total addressable market.

• Integration with grid expansion and storage solutions: As offshore wind capacity scales up, integrating with transmission grids, energy storage, and hybrid clean-energy systems will unlock further value and reliability.

• Expanding supply chains and industrial ecosystems: Growth of offshore wind will spur demand across turbine manufacturing, foundation construction, cable manufacturing, installation services and maintenance — creating a robust value chain across jurisdictions.

Challenges & Constraints — What Could Slow Growth

Even with strong growth forecasts, the offshore wind energy market faces several headwinds:

• High Capital Expenditure & Logistic Complexities: Offshore wind projects require significant upfront investment — turbine fabrication, foundation installation, specialized vessels, cabling, grid integration — which can make capital costs high, and project execution complex, especially in remote or deep-water sites. This remains a restraint.

• Competition from Other Renewables & Energy Sources: Onshore wind, solar photovoltaics, and other renewables — which often involve lower initial costs and simpler logistics — remain competitive alternatives. In regions where renewables are mature, offshore wind may need additional incentives or policy support to justify deployment.

• Regulatory, Permitting & Environmental Challenges: Marine regulations, environmental impact assessments, coastal zoning, public opposition, and ecosystem concerns (e.g., marine life impact, noise, seabed disruption) can delay or constrain projects. Implementation complexity is nontrivial.

• Supply-Chain & Infrastructure Readiness: Manufacturing turbines, foundations, cables and deploying installation vessels — all require mature supply chains and skilled labour. In regions lacking this, scaling may be slow.

• Grid Integration & Transmission Infrastructure Needs: Offshore wind farms must be connected to onshore grids via high-capacity undersea cables and substations. Building this requires coordination with grid operators, regulatory entities, and often large-scale investment — creating logistic and financial complexity.

Key Trends Shaping Offshore Wind Energy Market Dynamics

• Accelerated Turbine Technology Innovation

Driven by demand for greater energy yield and cost-effectiveness, turbine technology is evolving at pace. Larger rotor diameters, stronger blades, advanced foundations (monopile, jacket, floating), and improved installation techniques are boosting energy output per turbine — making offshore wind increasingly competitive.

As towers, blades and support structures scale up, engineering and design innovations (including AI-driven optimization) are gaining importance to ensure structural integrity, longevity and performance — especially in harsher marine environments.

• Rising Investments & Policy Support, Especially in Asia-Pacific & Europe

Europe — currently the leader in offshore wind energy market — continues to invest heavily, underpinned by clear regulatory frameworks, ambitious renewable targets, and mature supply chains. Meanwhile, Asia-Pacific is poised for rapid growth, driven by rising energy demand, growing coastal populations and strong government commitments to diversify energy mix and reduce carbon emissions.

New investments are also flowing into supporting infrastructure — foundations, cables, turbines manufacturing — expanding supply-chain capacity and improving economics for new projects.

• Expansion Beyond Shallow Water — Deeper Water & Floating Platforms

While fixed-structure installations in up-to-30 m water depth dominate today, interest is growing in deploying offshore wind farms in deeper waters — enabled by floating platforms and advanced foundation design. These would open up vast new coastal and offshore zones previously unsuitable for fixed installations, expanding the potential deployment geography.

• Growing Integration with Grid Infrastructure & Hybrid Energy Systems

As offshore wind capacity scales up, integrating generation with onshore grids becomes vital. This includes undersea cables, substations, grid upgrades, and potentially coupling with energy storage or other renewables (like solar) for hybrid energy systems — enhancing stability and flexibility of clean power supply.

• Multi-Stakeholder Collaboration & Global Supply-Chain Development

Offshore wind requires coordination across manufacturers, utilities, governments, financing institutions, installation and maintenance providers. As supply chains mature globally — from turbine manufacturing to cable production to installation vessels — offshore wind deployment could accelerate further, driven by efficiency gains and cost reductions.

Why Offshore Wind Growth Matters Globally

The expansion of the Offshore Wind Energy Market has far-reaching implications, beyond just energy generation:

• Accelerating Global Energy Transition: Scaling offshore wind can help countries diversify away from fossil fuels, reduce carbon emissions, and meet climate-change targets — supporting global commitments under international agreements.

• Strengthening Energy Security and Resilience: Offshore wind adds significant generation capacity, reduces dependence on imported fossil fuels, and can complement other renewables — enhancing energy supply stability.

• Economic Growth & Job Creation: Building offshore wind farms, manufacturing turbines and infrastructure, deploying installation vessels, and operating maintenance fleets create employment opportunities and stimulate industrial growth across sectors.

• Enabling Clean Growth for Coastal Nations: Countries with extensive coastlines — even those lacking fossil-fuel resources — can leverage offshore wind for sustainable development, providing clean energy for domestic use or even export.

• Innovation and Technological Advancement: The challenges of offshore wind — marine environment, deep water, turbine scaling — are driving innovation in engineering, materials, design, AI-driven optimization, and offshore construction techniques. These innovations may have spillover benefits for other marine and energy sectors.

The Offshore Wind Market is Poised for a Transformative Decade

The latest analysis from Acumen Research and Consulting suggests a compelling narrative: the Offshore Wind Energy Market is not just growing — it's on the cusp of a major transformation. From USD 29 billion in 2021 to a projected USD 137 billion by 2030, the sector stands to play a pivotal role in the global transition to sustainable energy.

This growth is underpinned by multiple reinforcing factors — rising demand for clean energy, favorable policies, technological progress, and expanding investments. As offshore wind moves beyond shallow-water, fixed-structure installations to deeper-water and potentially floating platforms; as supply chains mature; and as global collaboration intensifies — the potential for offshore wind to reshape energy systems is huge.

The world now invests twice as much in clean energy as it does in fossil fuels.
“The electricity-infrastructure-related elements of today’s energy deal could also be significant if done right.
“Indeed, Alberta would also benefit, perhaps even disproportionately, from doubling down on a clean energy future.
And until recently, Alberta led Canada and much of North America in attracting renewable investment.","TORONTO — Rachel Doran, executive director at Clean Energy Canada, made the following statement in response to the Canada-Alberta Memorandum of Understanding regarding a new energy deal:

“Today’s MOU with Alberta will require the federal government to negotiate firmly in the months ahead. Canada must work diligently to ensure it is not trading future climate promises that, as history suggests, could be reneged on in exchange for higher oil- and gas-related emissions today.

“Prime Minister Carney’s government risks trading certainty for expediency as it puts regulations with hard pollution limits—in this case, the Clean Electricity Regulations, oil and gas emissions cap, and methane regulations—on the negotiating table with provinces.

“Alberta had already agreed to increase its industrial carbon price by the terms of its last negotiation with Canada in 2018 in exchange for the Trans Mountain Expansion Project, so while today’s agreement does have some potential for good negotiated outcomes, it risks fundamentally undermining the durability of key federal regulations. If one province can be granted an exemption, any province can.

“Canadians should ensure that Prime Minister Carney holds firm on his statement that private proponents will shoulder the cost of any future pipeline in Canada. Going forward, the world will be using less and less oil after 2030, according to the International Energy Agency. Canada should therefore be putting public dollars toward the industries that will be growing, rather than those set to shrink. Globally, investment in clean energy has accelerated, and spending on renewable power, grids, and storage is now higher than total spending on oil, gas, and coal. The world now invests twice as much in clean energy as it does in fossil fuels.

“We were, however, cautiously optimistic to see potential in a number of key climate commitments integrated as part of this deal and the near-term timelines on which these need to come into effect.

“Alberta’s pledge to increase its industrial carbon price to $130/tonne could be a meaningful one, as that price would be higher than the federal backstop price currently scheduled to kick in next year ($110/tonne), but only if Alberta also works in good faith to address issues around stringency and helps ensure the market price of credits also rises. This also needs to be supported by the even bigger opportunity that a more unified industrial carbon market across Canada represents, something the federal government has promised to explore, and one that Alberta has an opportunity to lead.

“Given the importance of clean electricity to Canada’s economic future and the risk of setting a dangerous precedent where provinces can opt out of Canada’s climate regulations as they please, any deal related to the implementation of Canada’s clean electricity regulations in Alberta must be in the form of an equivalency agreement and not a provincial carveout.

“The electricity-infrastructure-related elements of today’s energy deal could also be significant if done right. Transmission interties from B.C. to Saskatchewan and a commitment to building thousands more megawatts of power could be the nation-building project Canadians have been waiting for, simultaneously building on Canada’s clean energy advantage, enhancing energy security, and lowering energy bills for Canadian households. But these new megawatts must be clean, leveraging the complementary renewables strengths and lowest-cost power sources that are already being deployed in B.C. and Alberta today—hydro, solar, and wind plus battery storage—as opposed to waiting on a future nuclear strategy that might add higher-cost power resources someday.

“Indeed, Alberta would also benefit, perhaps even disproportionately, from doubling down on a clean energy future. Modelling has shown that Alberta’s clean energy sector would be the fastest growing of any province or territory in Canada, with jobs increasing 10% every year in a net-zero future. And until recently, Alberta led Canada and much of North America in attracting renewable investment. But as a result of a moratorium and new restrictive regulations on renewables, the province has fallen to the bottom of the list in Canada on clean energy procurements, losing out on some 11 gigawatts of clean power (an amount that exceeds Alberta’s average total power demand) and tens of millions in community tax revenue.

“As negotiations on the implementation details of this MOU proceed in the coming months, Canada must keep both history and the future in mind. That means learning lessons from our past while aligning Canada with where the world is headed. It means shaping Canada into a lasting energy superpower, not just putting out the political fires of today.”",https://cleanenergycanada.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/52619404292_b82af6d790_k.jpg,N,,2025-11-27 18:01:13.598429

The impressive price action is starkly contradicted by a dramatic collapse in trading volume, which has plummeted to a level approximately 90% below its average. This divergence raises a critical question for market participants: is this the dawn of a genuine recovery, or a potential trap for retail investors as professional money remains on the sidelines?

The catalyst for this upward move appears to be a newly announced strategic shift from the company's leadership. CEO Robert Feurle aims to reduce Wolfspeed's risky dependence on the currently struggling electric vehicle (EV) sector. The new direction involves a push to expand the application of its silicon carbide technology into aviation, industrial infrastructure, and, most notably, the data centers that power artificial intelligence.

This vision has acted as a wake-up call, prompting a reassessment of the company's potential beyond automotive. However, the extremely thin trading volume suggests this is a period of high volatility rather than a phase of sustained accumulation by institutional investors. The market, it seems, is not yet fully convinced by this new strategy.

Financial Health Paints a Sobering Picture

The fundamental reality of Wolfspeed's finances stands in harsh contrast to the current price enthusiasm. Quarterly results released in October confirmed ongoing unprofitability, with a loss of $0.63 per share. While this figure slightly surpassed more pessimistic forecasts, the core issue of cash burn remains unresolved.

To ensure its survival and fund ambitious expansion plans, the company has secured a crucial $1.5 billion in liquidity through two key channels:

* A $750 million grant awarded under the U.S. ""CHIPS and Science Act.""

* An additional $750 million in private financing from a consortium led by Apollo Global Management.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying Wolfspeed?

This capital is vital for expanding manufacturing facilities in New York and North Carolina—the John Palmour Manufacturing Center—and for financing the technological transition to more efficient 200mm wafers. Concurrently, the company is shuttering its older 150mm production line in Durham, a clear cost-cutting measure.

Analysts Forecast Significant Downside

The gap between the current share price and the consensus view of market experts is substantial. While the stock trades near $19.39, the average analyst price target sits at a stark $10.50. The prevailing recommendation is clearly to ""Reduce,"" with many observers considering the equity to be severely overvalued at present levels.

Amid the prevailing pessimism, one notable voice offers a contrasting perspective. Susquehanna maintains a ""Neutral"" rating with a $30.00 price target, implying significant potential upside. Conversely, critics like Weiss Ratings steadfastly hold a ""Sell"" recommendation. With a negative Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio of -31, the company's valuation is currently supported by hope rather than concrete financial performance.

Key Data Summary:

* Price Movement: Shares advanced to approximately $19.39, reflecting a gain between 7.4% and 10.1% in a single session.

* Cautionary Signal: Trading volume registered about 90% below its historical average.

* Valuation Risk: The consensus analyst target indicates a nearly 50% downside risk.

* Financial Standing: A $1.5 billion funding package has temporarily secured the company's liquidity.

Investing in Wolfspeed at this juncture represents a high-stakes wager. The market is currently balancing the short-term safety provided by the massive capital infusion against the persistent operational losses.

Toyota also announced an additional investment of up to US$10 billion over the next five years to support future mobility programs in the United States, bringing its total historical investment in the country to nearly US$60 billion.

Chinese Truck Manufacturers Rush Mexico Strategy on Tariff Fears

Chinese truck manufacturers operating in Mexico are accelerating local strategies as they brace for a possible import tariff of up to 50% on vehicles from countries without trade agreements. The proposal has not clarified whether it will apply to trucks, tractors or buses, but companies expect broad coverage. Several manufacturers have begun talks with authorities, adjusted investment plans or fast-tracked facility construction to offset potential cost increases.

Click here to subscribe to Shift Storm and get the latest updates straight to your inbox as soon as they come out.

In a recent speech, prime minister Mark Carney promised that the federal government’s forthcoming Climate Competitiveness Strategy—his government’s first emission reduction plan—will focus on “results over objectives” and “investment over prohibition.” It was a curious choice of words that reveals much about this government’s climate policy thinking.

First, while tangible results are of course the core of progress, there is no way to measure results outside the context of a broader objective. Downplaying those objectives, such as Canada’s 2030 Paris Agreement commitments, as Carney has done, muddies the waters—perhaps deliberately—about what constitutes climate action.

Is building a liquified natural gas (LNG) plant a “result”? Not if your objective is to actually reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But if you have no long-term targets or guiding principles besides economic activity in the abstract then… sure, why not?

Second, while “investment” is inoffensive enough as a priority—we do, in fact, require transformative investments in a cleaner economy—there is something both underhanded and misleading about labelling public interest regulation as “prohibition.” Many of the most successful climate policies in history, including Canada’s phase-out of coal power, have incorporated “prohibitions” of one sort or another. These policies work because they lead to an absolute reduction in the amount of pollution being produced, which is the only metric that matters from the perspective of climate change.

It does not matter how many electric vehicles we put on the road, for example, if we don’t take internal combustion engine vehicles off the road. We can’t negotiate with planetary physics.

In other words, a true climate competitiveness strategy needs to include results and objectives, investment and prohibition. Delivering half a strategy—especially one without a guiding vision and without the regulatory tools to enforce it—is no strategy at all.

The Carney climate plan was originally supposed to be a stand-alone document, but it now looks as if it will be folded into next week’s federal budget. It’s the first thing I’ll be looking for during the budget lockup in Ottawa, so stay tuned for the CCPA’s post-budget analysis.

On a related note, the latest Alternative Federal Budget was released this week, which is essential reading for progressives in Canada and the benchmark against which we will be evaluating the government’s budget. The AFB is produced each year by a committee of almost one hundred contributors and it offers a rich and compelling vision for truly progressive federal policy.

I pitched in on several chapters this year, including the AFB’s first ever chapter on artificial intelligence. It’s a topic that is absorbing more and more of my attention these days, as you’ll see in this month’s research highlights. But there is plenty of climate and labour news to dive into as well, so let’s get started.

Storm surge: this month’s key reads

Making climate action entirely about economics is missing the point

Over the past few years, the climate movement has drifted toward couching climate action entirely in economic terms rather than foregrounding any sort of moral or social imperative. Governments, corporations and households care about the bottom line, the argument goes, so if we can only explain how costly it is to keep burning fossil fuels—and how much money can be made in the clean economy—then perhaps they will acquiesce to the rationality of emissions reductions.

It’s not all wrong and I’m not pointing fingers here. Foregrounding the economics of climate change is sort of my whole thing. But losing sight of the bigger picture (i.e., human and planetary well-being) introduces some big risks that are laid bare in several recent studies.

Unjust Transition, published by Oxfam, exposes the neo-colonialism inherent to much of the global climate project. The scramble for minerals, in particular, is reproducing patterns of exploitation that are harming the Global South for the enrichment of the largest corporations in the Global North. Similar patterns are evident in the proliferation of international climate finance, which is being delivered mainly as loans (increasingly via the private sector) rather than as true aid. Instead of unlocking the climate and economic potential of developing countries, it is exacerbating crippling levels of indebtedness.

A study by the United Nations Environment Programme, Financing the Responsible Supply of Energy Transition Minerals for Sustainable Development, reaches a similar conclusion, highlighting that human rights abuses and equity issues are endemic to the global mining industry and will be perpetuated in the absence of new legal standards and financing structures.

And a report published by the Canadian Coalition of Women in Engineering, Science, Trades and Technology, Futures Under Siege, finds that climate policy across Canadian jurisdictions is systematically excluding marginalized groups, including the Indigenous and racialized communities that are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. The report points out that emissions reductions and clean investments achieved outside of an equity framework may, in fact, make many people worse off.

The real purpose of climate action is not to reduce emissions or to increase green investment for their own sakes. It is to create a liveable world for ourselves and future generations. When we lose sight of that imperative, we risk becoming trapped in a short-sighted economic logic that may not actually improve well-being now or in the future.

Research radar: the latest developments in work and climate

The oil and gas industry is not a part of the renewable energy solution. Despite the industry’s claims to be supporting the transition to a cleaner economy, a new article in the journal Nature Sustainability finds that the 250 largest fossil fuel companies in the world account for only 1.42 per cent of global investment in renewables, and those investments account for only 0.13 per cent of the total energy produced by these companies. The idea that the fossil fuel industry is “part of the solution” is textbook greenwashing.

Canada’s oil industry is lining the pockets of foreign shareholders at the expense of Canadian workers. A new report from the Alberta Federation of Labour and Canadians for Tax Fairness, Exporting Profits, finds that oil industry profits are increasingly being distributed to foreign shareholders rather than domestic workers. The ratio of shareholder profits to worker wages is now three-to-one—the reverse of the rest of the Canadian economy—and the gap is widening over time as oil companies reduce investment and increase dividends and share buybacks. It’s hardly news, but, like greenwashing, the argument that the oil and gas industry is acting in the best interests of its workers does not hold water.

Canada violating commitment to end fossil fuel finance. In 2021, the 40 signatories to the Clean Energy Transition Partnership, including Canada, agreed to end international support for fossil fuels. Yet as a new report from the International Institute for Sustainable Development, Holding Course, Missing Speed, reveals, seven of those signatories, including Canada, continue to support the industry financially. Not only do we need to stop doing so, the report argues, we need to be rapidly redirecting international financial flows to support clean development instead.

UK plans to create 420,000 green jobs in five years. The UK’s new Clean energy jobs plan includes funding of £1.2 billion ($2.2 billion) per year for skills development in strategic sectors. It’s one of the first green skills plans I’ve seen that actually sets targets at the correct order of magnitude—a weakness of Canada’s skill training programs that I’ve long criticized. We need to be training tens or hundreds of thousands of new workers each year to meet demand in a clean economy, yet programs such as the Sustainable Jobs Training Fund only aim to support a few thousand workers per year.

Green industrial policy continues to enter the mainstream. In An Industrial Policy Renaissance, the International Institute for Sustainable Development offers a helpful primer on the history, purpose and promise of green industrial policy. The paper dives into a number of recent case studies, such as in Brazil and Korea, that weren’t on the map when the CCPA published our own guide to green industrial policy just a few years ago. An industrial policy orientation is increasingly essential for competing in the global economy.

Labour conditions are an underappreciated tool for enabling workforce transitions. In its latest report, Just Transition Conditionalities, the Scottish Just Transition Commission gets into the weeds of the policy levers available to governments for ensuring that public and private investment is producing pro-social outcomes. For example, governments can require that infrastructure projects employ a certain share of apprentices or that a certain share of profits are reinvested into communities. In Canada, our governments are increasingly requiring that developers sign community benefit agreements in order to access public funding, which is a promising trend that should be accelerated.

Just transitions are more likely to succeed when they are localized and planned in advance. A study from the Asia Investor Group on Climate Change, Place-Based Just Transition, unpacks the energy transitions underway in India, Indonesia, Malaysia and Japan. Although the paper is aimed more at investors than policy makers, it reaches the important conclusion that proactively managed transitions that are responsive to local contexts are more successful and less disruptive than reactionary, generalized transition programs.

A green bargaining toolkit for teachers unions. The U.S.-based Labor Network for Sustainability released Bargaining for Green Schools, Good Jobs, and Bright Futures, a report that provides a useful set of case studies and best practices for advancing climate action in schools through labour organizing. Decarbonizing schools offers many benefits, including reduced energy costs and improved health outcomes for students.

New book unpacks the coalitions challenging the corporate power of the fossil fuel industry. I’m really looking forward to a new book from McGill University’s Amy Janzwood, Mega Pipelines, Mega Resistance, that is set to release next month. It promises a deep dive into the activist coalitions that have opposed exploitative fossil fuel development in Canada. If I can get my hands on a copy, I’ll review it in a future newsletter.

Dark clouds: artificial intelligence on the horizon

Canadian public service especially vulnerable to AI job loss. A report from the Future Skills Centre, Adoption Ready?, finds that half of public servants in Canada are in occupations categorized as high-exposure and low-complementarity in the context of AI, which means they are more likely to be replaced by AI than augmented by it over the long term. Unfortunately, rather than calling into question the desirability of displacing such a substantial and critical part of the workforce, the paper offers only milquetoast suggestions for mitigating harm as AI inevitably washes over the public sector.",https://www.policyalternatives.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/pn_climateTargets-header.png,N,,2025-11-27 16:00:13.532484

“As physicians, we are deeply alarmed to see this thorough gutting of Canada’s climate commitments. The Federal-Alberta agreement includes an explicit commitment to expand fossil fuel production—the leading cause of climate change. It delays, weakens or entirely cancels Canada’s most important measures to tackle climate pollution, including a clean electricity grid, oil and gas emissions cap, oil tanker ban, industrial carbon price, methane emission reductions, and anti-greenwashing protections.

“It commits to build a pipeline through First Nations’ territories who oppose the project, with no mention of gaining their consent. Finally, it replaces sound strategies to tackle climate change with dangerous, untested carbon capture and storage (CCUS) projects.

“Climate change threatens the health of humanity. It is beyond the pale to be doubling down on fossil fuel expansion at precisely the moment we need to be quitting oil and gas. The health impacts of this agreement will be profound and far-reaching.”

Dr. Melissa Lem, Past President of the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment, said:

“Climate pollution from expanded oil production intensifies extreme weather, extreme heat, infectious diseases, and disruptions to our food supply. Increased oil extraction worsens air quality, leading to higher rates of respiratory disease, heart problems, and premature deaths in local communities. And building a new pipeline threatens the safety of First Nations and other communities in British Columbia, who are on the front lines of potential oil spills and increased tanker traffic.

“Overall, this agreement is a dangerous step backward. Canada needs bold leadership to safeguard our health and that of future generations. Our governments should be investing in clean energy solutions that will create jobs, improve air quality, and safeguard the health of all people – not granting the wishes of the sunsetting fossil fuel industry.”

The trends in the U.S. shale industry suggest it will not come to that because production would stop growing long before that.","Shale drillers are finding new and exciting ways to boost production in the Permian and elsewhere. This can make the industry more resilient to international price swings—but never fully resilient and never for very long. The pain from the prolonged price depression is beginning to bite in.

Back in October, Kpler warned that U.S. oil production could shed 700,000 barrels daily if international oil prices slid lower than $60 per barrel. The analytics firm cited drilled but uncompleted well data showing the inventory of these wells had shrunk by between 25% and 30% in the Bakken and the Eagle Ford basins since the start of 2025.

Now, Reuters is reporting that the Permian is also feeling the pinch, with towns dependent on the oil industry starting to suffer the economic consequences of a downturn. The publication interviewed industry executives and local business owners to find that the key industry of the region is retrenching, spending less, and idling rigs.

Everyone has, of course, heard about the layoffs in Big Oil majors. The majors themselves have framed it as part of a long-term strategy to become leaner. Reuters suggests that they are having trouble maintaining the workforce, citing Bureau of Labor Statistics data showing that overall employment in the U.S. oil industry declined by 4,000 between January and July this year. Over the same period, however, production of crude oil has continued to grow, creating a perhaps confusing picture.

The confusion goes away once focus shifts to those drilling efficiency gains that Bloomberg’s Javier Blas detailed earlier this month, noting supermajors’ race to lower drilling costs in the shale patch by researching cheaper proppants, for instance, and surfactants that help the oil flow more easily from the rock. The focus, he wrote, citing the industry, was to maximize recovery rates from existing wells.

“The best place to find oil is where you already know you've got oil,” Chevron’s chief executive, Mike Wirth, told Blas in an interview. “We know where the oil is. If we left 90% of the oil behind, it would be the first time in history that we didn't figure out how to do it.”

So, that’s one reason drilling rigs are down—while production keeps climbing higher—but it is not the only reason, based on what Reuters reports from the Permian. “We've had dialogue with the administration, letting them know that oil prices in the low to mid $50s make returns increasingly difficult for investment. This will eventually make current production levels unsustainable,” the chief executive of Admiral Permian Resources told Reuters.

Meanwhile, as international prices decline, the cost of drilling a well has gone up by between 5% and 10% from last year, according to the boss of Latigo Petroleum. “The economics are completely upside down from where they were just in January. It's more expensive to drill a well and you're getting 20% less for your oil,” Kirk Edwards told Reuters.

Ironically, the pervasive perception of unrelenting production growth in the U.S. shale patch has become the chief reason for bearish oil price predictions, expecting supply to exceed demand for oil for a prolonged period of time. Analysts regularly cite record-breaking output numbers as evidence that oil supply keeps growing despite price movements, suggesting that U.S. shale is more resilient than what the industry itself says it is.

“Investment returns at $55 to $60 per barrel are not what they were at the same price five years ago because the best wells have been drilled,” Admiral Permian Resources’ CEO told Reuters, which also noted a slowdown in oilfield service activity as evidence of a broader downturn in the shale industry—even if the number of barrels per day produced by that industry are still climbing.

In fairness, that trend emerged earlier in the year as reported by the biggest oilfield service providers—every one of them reported slower business in North America and stronger business abroad. The early signs, therefore, were out there for everyone to see, but instead, analysts doubled down on booming shale output, driving a global supply overhang, which kept the pressure on prices high.

“Although majors and large independents can operate below $50/bbl, this price level would enforce cautious activity for most,” Kpler analyst Johannes Raubal wrote in October. “A severe, sustained $50/bbl scenario—a view held by some agencies and banks like Goldman Sachs—would cripple US crude supply,” he warned. Yet here’s JP Morgan, predicting continued growth in U.S. shale oil production, leading to a further slump in oil prices, potentially as low as $30 per barrel.

The trends in the U.S. shale industry suggest it will not come to that because production would stop growing long before that. And the first time the Energy Information Administration reports a negative change in output, prices will rebound like there was never a danger of a supply overhang, let alone one so substantial that it could push Brent crude below $40.

Growing supply of clean electricity remains biggest opportunity for affordability, jobs, energy security, climate

VANCOUVER — JESSICA MCILROY, manager of Government Relations at the Pembina Institute, made the following statement in response to the release of the CleanBC review panel’s final report:

“Today’s review of CleanBC recognizes that the global clean energy transition is well underway, and that reducing emissions and building a strong, resilient economy that works for British Columbians go hand-in-hand.

“We were pleased to see many of the critical actions we recommended as part of the review process reflected in the expert panel’s report.

“It’s clear that B.C. should continue what’s working: growing our supply of clean electricity, strengthening industrial carbon pricing and reducing methane emissions, helping people electrify their homes and vehicles, and supporting workers transitioning to jobs in the clean economy. CleanBC has successfully positioned B.C. as a clean energy leader, showing that reducing emissions and embracing clean energy is how we build a resilient economy.

“None of this can be achieved without a ready and skilled workforce. The review rightly notes the importance of establishing a labour market outlook and development plan to help workers seize opportunities. The commitment to doubling government’s investment in skilled trades training in B.C.’s “Look West” strategy will help workers find jobs in the low-carbon economy.

“As Canada’s leader in EV adoption, and with our clean electricity grid and major investments in charging infrastructure, B.C. can be a global EV leader, if we commit. We can adjust course where needed, but weakening the overall signal would slow the introduction of new, more affordable models that would allow more British Columbians to experience the cost-savings that come with EVs. We should aim high and help push the country forward as global EV momentum accelerates.

“The expert panel recognizes that reliance on LNG remains a risky economic bet — and that the government’s plans to increase gas production and LNG exports threatens progress. We support the panel’s recommendations to prioritize other uses of our finite clean electricity supply, and ensure that all energy development in the province is based on consultation and partnership with Indigenous nations.

“CleanBC’s success should be measured in ways that are meaningful to British Columbians: how many EVs are we driving, how many heat pumps have we installed in our homes, and how much money have they saved us. Also, how much is being invested and how many jobs are being created, thanks to our economy-wide adoption of clean energy.

“B.C. has made progress to reduce emissions and prepare for leadership in the clean economy, but we must now do more, faster. British Columbians want energy solutions that save them money, that learn from our successes and respect regional differences. It’s now on government to solidly commit to these recommendations and provide the certainty the private sector needs, so British Columbians can experience the full range of benefits — from cost-savings and jobs, to energy security and healthier communities.”

The program aims to set up 6,000 metric tons per annum (MTPA) of integrated REPM manufacturing in India.

The total financial outlay of the program comprises sales-linked incentives of ₹64.5 billion (~$722.73 million) on REPM sales for five years and a capital subsidy of ₹7.5 billion (~$84.03 million).

The program envisions allocating the total capacity to five beneficiaries through a global competitive bidding process. Each beneficiary will be allotted up to 1,200 MTPA of capacity.

The total duration of the program will be seven years from the date of award, including a two-year gestation period for setting up an integrated REPM manufacturing facility, and five years for incentive disbursement on the sale of REPM.

REPMs are among the strongest permanent magnets and are vital for electric vehicles, renewable energy, electronics, aerospace, and defence applications. The program will support the creation of integrated REPM manufacturing facilities, involving conversion of rare earth oxides to metals, metals to alloys, and alloys to finished REPMs.

Driven by rapidly growing demand from electric vehicles, renewable energy, industrial applications, and consumer electronics, India’s consumption of REPMs is expected to double by 2030. At present, India’s demand for REPMs is met primarily by imports.

In September 2025, the Union Cabinet approved a ₹15 billion (~$170.19 million) incentive program to develop India’s recycling capacity for separating and producing critical minerals from secondary sources such as e-waste and lithium-ion battery scrap. This program is a part of the National Critical Mineral Mission, under the Ministry of Mines, which aims to build domestic capacity and supply chain resilience for critical minerals.

As of mid-October, the US data center pipeline reached 245 GW of planned capacity, driven by a handful of enormous, speculative projects. These projects, and the renewable deals hyperscalers are signing, skew heavily toward Texas. More than a quarter of pipeline capacity targets the state, whose pipeline nearly doubled from 35 GW in Q1 to 67 GW in Q3.

Data Center Alley gives way to Data Center Prairie

It is conventional wisdom that for data center developers, ‘access to power’ has become the mantra. That is, the importance of fiber proximity to end customers and other data centers has been superseded by the imperative to secure power from utilities. The giga-scale campuses that have been announced this year, sited in Pennsylvania, Wyoming, and particularly West and North Texas, signal yet another pivot in strategy. Developers have increasingly given up confidence that utilities can meet their power and timeline demand and instead seek to build their own generation based on local natural resources.

Most frequently, this resource is natural gas, with a particular focus on the Permian in Texas. Pacifico Energy’s 5-GW GW Ranch, poolside’s 2-GW Project Horizon, and FO Permian’s 5-GW campus in Midland County are examples. The gas network in the US is at capacity, and building new gas generation far from supply means paying for and - perhaps more importantly for developers - waiting for new pipeline capacity.

In some cases, it should be noted, campuses are being leveraged for their scale and solar or wind resource, such as Tract’s data center parks in Nevada and Utah, and Quantica’s Big Sky Digital Infrastructure campus in Montana. While more headlines have made about the potential for batteries to make data centers flexible assets, we’ve found that batteries are being planned much more commonly to balance renewables at large campuses and to add needed fast-ramping capacity to onsite gas.

Distorting the capital landscape

These mega campuses not only reflect a new siting strategy: they distort the capital landscape. The 2% of projects over US$17 billion represent 42% of overall capital deployment, with the 60% of projects below US$1 billion contributing only 8%. With questions already intensifying regarding froth in project investment and company valuations, these projects promise to drive even more froth.

The two highest-cost projects, Project Jupiter in New Mexico (US$160 billion) and Project Kestrel in Missouri (US$100 billion), are an order of magnitude more expensive than the campuses being developed by companies like Meta and Microsoft, without appreciable increase in IT infrastructure. They are notably being funded through novel financial engineering: Their developers will be both the payers and payees of industrial revenue bonds (IRBs) issued by the local government, a contrivance that enables tax benefits.

Betting big on onsite generation

The new energy-chasing campuses are committing to onsite generation in a way that developers have been hesitant to in the past. Hyperscalers have been very clear that they prefer grid power, which requires less operating risk, shorter contract commitments, and no exposure to scope 1 emissions. Developer commitment to onsite generation reflects a bet either that hyperscalers urgency to deploy will overcome their concerns, or that the developer will be able to sell to a new generation of hyperscalers with greater risk tolerance and less concern for sustainability.

The net result is that while the number of projects in the pipeline with onsite generation has increased only to 10%, these projects represent a whopping 34% of pipeline capacity.

Unsurprisingly, the vast majority of sites are in Texas, and the technology is gas turbines.

This trend could have significant implications for both energy affordability and reliability. Whether on- or off-grid, projects with utility-scale gas generation will increase gas burns, competing with LNG exports and raising the long-term price of natural gas. This will drive up both gas and electricity bills across the country. To the extent to which turbine-based projects are off-grid, utilities will have an even harder time obtaining turbines given production limitations. That could pose reliability challenges for on-grid load growth, including electrification.

Whether or not a bubble bursts, these affordability and reliability challenges are likely to provoke state intervention to protect customers. As that begins to happen, all bets are off.

The Regional Development Association of East Central Kansas voted unanimously to support a plan to explore siting a Natrium advanced nuclear reactor in the region, according to KVOE. The decision follows a new memorandum of understanding between TerraPower, Evergy, and the Kansas Department of Commerce, marking the latest step toward expanding nuclear energy in the state.

The Natrium design uses a 345-megawatt sodium-cooled fast reactor paired with a molten salt energy storage system, allowing operators to boost output to 500 megawatts during periods of high demand. It's the same model under construction in Wyoming and is part of the cleaner energy push to stabilize the U.S. energy grid.

Nuclear power is one of the few energy sources capable of generating large amounts of low-carbon electricity around the clock, complementing renewable energy sources like wind and solar to enhance energy security and drive us toward a cleaner future.

However, nuclear power also has drawbacks, including high upfront construction costs, radioactive waste disposal, and safety concerns. Advancements in small modular and advanced reactor designs like Natrium could help address many of these issues, making nuclear a key player in reducing reliance on dirty energies and cutting planet-overheating pollution.

State Rep. Mark Schreiber called the proposal a ""tremendous opportunity"" for Lyon County, citing the area's existing infrastructure and skilled workforce, per WIBW.

Flint Hills Technical College has also pledged full support for the project, according to its president, Caron Daugherty. The college's power-plant technology program ""would be a tremendous resource that could help build and sustain a revolving workforce for maintaining and running the reactor,"" Daugherty stated, per WIBW.

""I think Kansas is perfectly situated right in the middle of the country and in the middle of the Southwest Power Pool, with a good transmission network to create power here and to be able to ship it north, south, east, or west,"" Schreiber told KSN.

Beyond the energy big picture, it is an opportunity and a ""watershed moment"" for local employment, according to Emporia Commissioner Jamie Sauder, who sees direct and long-term positive impacts for housing and local hospitality sectors, per KVOE.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Natriumimage-recYFoh5q33n7TAo7-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-27 17:01:16.648394

While the average gasoline price in Washington has dropped 16 cents since last month, from $4.34 to $4.18 per gallon, it’s still 18 cents more than last Thanksgiving, according to AAA. Meanwhile, millions of people are hitting the road, increasing the estimated travel time from Seattle to Bellingham by 77%.

The average price nationwide sits at about $3.04, around 2 cents lower than last Thanksgiving. Earlier this year, Democrats increased the state gas tax by 6 cents to help overcome a deficit. Next July, the tax will begin rising by 2% annually, driving up the prices of groceries and other products with it.

“Drivers have grown more resilient to price swings, yet I worry that concerns about a cooling economy may be weighing on Americans,” Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, wrote in a news release. “Even with affordable gas, economic uncertainty can make people stay closer to home.”

De Haan said even though the average price nationwide is holding steady, it’s not translating to more travelers, let alone for one of the states with the highest gas prices in the country. According to AAA, Washington ranks third for the most expensive gas in the nation, right behind California and Hawaii.

Following the Evergreen State are Nevada, Oregon, Alaska, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Idaho and Illinois. If someone drove the few minutes from Spokane across the state line to Idaho, they could see prices dip nearly $1. That may not amount to much now, but the gap could widen by 2% annually if prices hold.

“Every year without any change in the price of oil, Washingtonians are going to have to pay 2% more, and it might be closer to 2.5%, because that additional tax also reduces the purchasing power, which causes inflation in and of itself,” De Haan said in an interview with The Center Square on Wednesday.

He attributed the state’s position as having one of the most expensive gas prices in the nation to the Climate Commitment Act. The CCA sets a declining cap on emissions for the state’s largest polluters, requiring them to purchase “allowances” at quarterly auctions to offset their environmental impact.

Oil refineries respond by raising gasoline prices, which in turn drive up prices at the grocery store and other businesses due to higher trucking costs. De Haan said the CCA caused fuel prices to rise almost immediately, despite former Gov. Jay Inslee arguing that it would only amount to pennies.

De Haan said the more recent increases in gas prices are due to regulatory conditions across the West Coast, as refineries consider leaving the region because of the political climate. He said gas shipments are on the way from overseas to provide some relief, though 2% annual gas tax hikes still loom.

Issues with the Olympic Pipeline slowed down relief, as the shutdown requires around 1,300 truckers daily to transport the oil that the infrastructure routes along the West Coast, he said. De Haan thinks that once everything is back to normal, the state’s average gas price could drop below $4 per gallon.

“Washington state, given the fact that it’s a cap and trade state, is now likely going to be inked in as a permanent resident of the top five gas prices in the country,” De Haan told The Center Square.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/fwbusiness.com/content/tncms/custom/image/e47550d8-b866-11ed-a481-ffd95f72d957.jpg?resize=600%2C315,N,,2025-11-27 15:01:23.431223

According to Baker Hughes, this week’s report reveals that oil rigs have fallen to their lowest numbers in four years, while gas rigs experienced a slight increase. This shift highlights ongoing adjustments within the energy sector as companies respond to fluctuating market conditions and pricing dynamics. The decline in oil rigs, particularly in Texas, reflects broader industry trends as firms prioritize financial stability over expanding production. These changes raise questions about future energy output and the implications for the U.S. economy.

Declining Rig Count Reflects Industry Trends

The rig count, a critical metric for evaluating future energy production, saw a notable decrease this week. Baker Hughes reported a drop by 10 rigs, bringing the total to 544, the lowest since September. This reduction underscores a trend where energy firms are scaling back operations in response to declining oil prices. The decision to cut rigs suggests that companies are shifting their focus from production expansion to financial health, aiming to enhance shareholder returns and reduce debt. This strategic pivot comes as analysts predict a continued decline in U.S. crude prices, which have been falling for the past several years.

Texas, the leading oil and gas-producing state, experienced a significant reduction, with its rig count dropping by eight to 226, marking the lowest level since July 2021. This decline is indicative of broader shifts in the energy sector as companies adjust their strategies to navigate the current economic landscape. The reduction in rigs also reflects a cautious approach by energy firms, as they balance the need for profitability with the challenges of a fluctuating market.

Gas Rigs on the Rise Amid Price Increases

While oil rigs have decreased, the number of gas rigs has risen, with an increase of three rigs, reaching a total of 130. This marks the highest count since July 2023, driven by a projected 58% increase in spot gas prices in 2025. The rise in gas rigs suggests a renewed interest in gas production, as companies anticipate higher profits from increased prices. This shift in focus highlights the dynamic nature of the energy market, where firms are quick to adapt to changing conditions to maximize returns.

The Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts a significant increase in gas output, projecting a rise to 107.7 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in 2025. This represents a substantial jump from previous years, indicating a strong response from producers to capitalize on favorable market conditions. The increase in gas drilling activity reflects a strategic move by energy companies to diversify their portfolios and leverage opportunities in the gas sector, even as they scale back on oil production.

Economic Implications of Rig Count Changes

The reduction in oil rigs and the increase in gas rigs have broader economic implications. As firms prioritize financial stability, the shift in focus away from oil production may impact overall energy output and influence global market dynamics. The decrease in oil rigs could lead to tighter supply conditions, potentially affecting prices and impacting consumers. However, the increase in gas production may offset some of these effects, providing a buffer against potential energy shortages.

The energy sector’s strategic adjustments will likely have ripple effects across the economy. A reduction in oil production could influence U.S. energy exports, affecting trade balances and international relations. Additionally, changes in energy production can impact employment within the industry, as firms may adjust their workforce to align with new production goals. These economic considerations highlight the interconnected nature of the energy sector and its influence on broader economic trends.

Future Outlook for U.S. Energy Production

Looking ahead, the U.S. energy landscape is poised for further changes as companies continue to navigate a complex market environment. With oil prices projected to decline for a third consecutive year, firms may maintain a cautious approach, focusing on financial stability rather than aggressive expansion. However, the anticipated increase in gas prices presents opportunities for growth within the gas sector, offering a potential avenue for increased production and revenue.

The future of U.S. energy production will depend on a variety of factors, including market dynamics, technological advancements, and regulatory policies. As firms adjust their strategies to align with these factors, the energy sector will continue to evolve, shaping the economic and environmental landscape. The ongoing changes raise important questions about the future direction of U.S. energy policy and the potential impacts on global energy markets.

The recent shifts in the U.S. energy sector underscore the need for adaptive strategies in an ever-changing market. As companies balance production goals with financial stability, the implications for the broader economy remain uncertain. How will these adjustments impact the U.S. energy landscape and its role in the global market? The answers will depend on how firms and policymakers respond to evolving challenges and opportunities in the years ahead.

The company's diversified utility operations continue to underpin its steady performance.

Duke Energy’s share price recently ticked higher to $123.43, putting its momentum back on investors’ radar after a solid start to the year. While the 1-day share price return was 1.23%, what also stands out is the 14.48% gain year-to-date and a five-year total shareholder return of 59.96%, highlighting how steady utility demand and measured growth strategies have rewarded patient shareholders over time.

If you’re looking to broaden your search after observing Duke Energy’s steady move, now is an opportune time to explore other fast-growing companies with high insider ownership using our .

With a strong track record and the stock trading around 11% below analyst price targets, the question remains: Is Duke Energy undervalued right now, or is the market already accounting for its growth prospects?

Most Popular Narrative: 10.2% Undervalued

Duke Energy’s most followed narrative sets a fair value substantially above its last close of $123.43, suggesting market participants are missing constructive catalysts on the horizon.

Major economic development wins (such as AWS's $10B data center in North Carolina), paired with accelerated migration and manufacturing demand in Duke's service territory, are expected to drive robust, multi-year load and volume growth. This supports higher revenues and long-term EPS growth. Supportive state and federal legislation, including the Power Bill Reduction Act in NC and the Energy Security Act in SC, streamlines cost recovery for new generation and grid investments. These measures reduce regulatory lag and improve cash flow and earnings stability over the next decade.

Want to know what’s powering this premium? The narrative centers on a combination of rising earnings, ongoing revenue expansion, and a notable profit margin trajectory. The real surprise is that it projects a valuation multiple comparable to some of the country’s highest-growth companies. Interested in the financial factors behind this outlook? Check out the details that are moving the needle on Duke Energy’s fair value calculation.

Result: Fair Value of $137.47 (UNDERVALUED)

However, accelerated adoption of distributed energy and rising capital needs could challenge Duke Energy’s revenue growth and put future margins under pressure.

Another View: How Does DCF Stack Up?

While the popular narrative suggests Duke Energy is undervalued based on analyst price targets, our SWS DCF model arrives at a different conclusion. The DCF estimate puts fair value at just $63.17 per share, meaning the stock looks overvalued compared to its current market price. This divergence in outcomes may be due to growth assumptions that could be overly optimistic or to the possibility that the market is expecting catalysts that the cash flow model does not capture.

In the sea of renewable energy possibilities, wind power has emerged as a strong contender for the crown of top renewable energy resource. Ocean Winds, a 50-50 joint venture between EDPR and ENGIE, has been awarded the rights to construct a new 1.5 GW floating wind project in the Celtic Sea off the coast of England and Scotland.

The Crown Estate has selected Ocean Winds as the winner of the latest bidding round

The Crown Estate recently gave the good news to Ocean Winds as part of its Offshore Wind Leasing Round 5, marking a turning point for the UK’s wind power ambitions in the near future. The site in the Celtic Sea is one of three that were offered to potential operators as part of the leasing round, with the other two being awarded in June of this year.

The 358 km² site in the Celtic Sea will enable Ocean Winds to develop a floating offshore wind project located in water depths of 71 – 88 metres, with the company noting the project will be delivered in several phases. This latest development underscores Ocean Winds’ commitment to maturing the UK’s offshore wind sector to reach new and astonishing heights in the coming years.

“We are proud to be selected for the award of development rights for this strategic site. With over a decade of experience pioneering floating wind technology, and a proven ability to deliver fixed bottom projects at pace, we are confident in our capabilities to deliver this commercial scale floating project. The project will bring substantial benefits to the UK and play a vital role in the energy transition.” – Craig Windram, CEO of Ocean Winds

Ocean Winds has become the backbone of the international wind power sector

The firm has an unwavering commitment to maturing the wind power sector, not just in the United Kingdom, but all across the length and breadth of the world. Ocean Winds is the first company to successfully construct and install a semi-submersible floating wind farm. The firm launched the world’s first project in Portugal in 2020.

It should be noted that this is not Ocean Winds’ first wind project in the UK, with the Moray East and Moray West projects’ success making Ocean Winds the largest wind operator in Scotland.

The initiative, launched jointly by the African Development Bank Group (AfDB) and the World Bank Group, represents one of Africa’s most ambitious energy access campaigns.
However, he argued the budget fails to prioritise the very group at the heart of innovation in this space, namely young entrepreneurs in the clean energy sector.
The group also criticised what it describes as near-absent youth participation in Ghana’s energy planning processes, a gap they say is inconsistent with the National Youth Policy 2022 to 2032.
Ghana joined 28 other African countries that have now presented National Energy Compacts since Mission 300’s launch in January 2025.","A youth advocacy organisation has criticised Ghana’s 2025 Budget Statement for failing to adequately recognise and support young entrepreneurs driving clean energy innovation across the country.

The Strategic Youth Network for Development (SYND) says this oversight threatens progress toward universal energy access and the Mission 300 target, which aims to connect 300 million Africans to electricity by 2030. The initiative, launched jointly by the African Development Bank Group (AfDB) and the World Bank Group, represents one of Africa’s most ambitious energy access campaigns.

Chibeze Ezekiel, Executive Director of SYND, acknowledged at a press conference in Accra that the government has outlined an ambitious roadmap for expanding electricity access and promoting cleaner cooking. However, he argued the budget fails to prioritise the very group at the heart of innovation in this space, namely young entrepreneurs in the clean energy sector.

Speaking under the Youth in Natural Resources and Environmental Governance (Youth-NREG) Platform, Ezekiel said youth-owned businesses producing solar technologies, clean cookstoves, briquettes and other climate-friendly solutions receive little to no institutional support despite quietly powering rural homes, lowering cooking costs for families and creating green jobs.

Ghana unveiled its National Energy Compact in September 2025 as part of Mission 300, outlining plans to increase renewable energy’s share in the national mix from four per cent to 10 per cent by 2030 and mobilise $20 billion in investments over the next decade. Yet SYND warns that the budget’s failure to support youth-led clean energy businesses contradicts these commitments and slows national efforts to boost access through distributed solar, improved cookstoves and low-carbon fuels.

The group argues that expanding these enterprises would speed up Ghana’s clean energy rollout, improve livelihoods in rural communities and broaden the tax base through thousands of new direct and indirect jobs. Ezekiel noted that government should provide funding, capacity-building programs and policy incentives to help these green energy enterprises thrive and absorb unemployed youth into the job market.

SYND also expressed concern that the budget does not clearly outline job opportunities to be created through energy sector investments, which represents a major expectation under Mission 300. While the government has projected 800,000 new jobs in 2026 and indicated that renewable energy alone could create 322,110 jobs from 2026 to 2030, the budget does not specify how many will come from energy access programmes, electrification projects or renewable rollouts.

This lack of detail makes it difficult for young people to plan, prepare or receive the needed guidance to position themselves for employment in the sector, according to SYND.

On funding, SYND says the government’s allocation of GH¢2.0 billion for Phase I of the Rural Electricity Acceleration and Urban Intensification Initiative falls short of what the National Energy Compact requires. The Compact needs $4.4 billion in total, with at least $1.8 billion expected from public and donor financing. The group believes the current allocation, while commendable, is too small to push Ghana toward its target of near-universal electricity access by 2030.

They caution that inadequate funding risks delaying key projects, especially in rural communities where the remaining 3.7 million unconnected citizens reside.

The government plans to distribute 450,000 household cookstoves and 7,000 commercial ones under Phase I of the National Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) Promotion Programme to increase access to clean cooking. While Ezekiel welcomed this initiative, he pointed to a practical infrastructure challenge that could undermine its success.

SYND warns the rollout may result in thousands of unused cylinders if households cannot afford the gas or cannot find nearby refill points. Without more gas-filling stations and measures to make LPG affordable for poor families, the programme could fall short of its clean cooking ambitions.

The group also criticised what it describes as near-absent youth participation in Ghana’s energy planning processes, a gap they say is inconsistent with the National Youth Policy 2022 to 2032. The policy calls for creating spaces where the youth can influence national decisions, not simply be passive beneficiaries.

SYND says that while gender inclusion received attention in the National Energy Compact, youth inclusion did not. They insist that young people, often the most affected by energy poverty and the backbone of the clean-tech sector, cannot be left out of policies that shape the country’s future.

Ghana’s Energy Transition and Investment Plan aims for net-zero emissions by 2060 and has the potential to create over 400,000 jobs, requiring approximately $550 billion in investment. The plan envisions strong capital market involvement in the energy sector, with significant efforts needed to attract private investment.

SYND maintains that these weaknesses in the 2026 Budget pose a significant challenge to achieving the Mission 300 Programme and the goals outlined in the National Energy Compact. For them, Ghana’s energy future must be a partnership between government and the young innovators already building solutions on the ground.

Ezekiel insists that as the country pushes toward universal electricity access and cleaner forms of cooking, Ghana cannot achieve its goals by overlooking the hands shaping tomorrow’s energy landscape. He stressed that young people working in sustainable energy initiatives often lack the financial and technical support needed to scale their businesses, highlighting the urgent need for government intervention.

However, they say the Albanese Government has missed an opportunity to secure nature laws that genuinely safeguard Australia’s nature and climate for generations to come.

A deal struck between the Albanese Government and the Greens will ensure reforms to the Environment Protection Conservation and Biodiversity Act 1999 pass the Senate today.

Australia’s eight State and Territory conservation councils welcome the changes negotiated by Labor and the Greens to stop fast tracking of new coal and gas projects, restrictions on the delegation of powers to states and territories in some circumstances (including stopping devolution of the “water trigger”), and the closing of deforestation loopholes through Regional Forest Agreements.

However, they remain concerned that the draft laws include new pathways to hand approval powers to states and territories, and to fast track mining and land clearing via a streamlined process.

Australia will have a national Environment Protection Agency, but it will not be fully independent and will act on instructions from the Minister, who has sweeping powers to override departmental and scientific advice.

There are some significant concessions in the deal, including stopping fast-tracking of coal and gas projects, and exempt from the application of new National Interest provisions.

Clearing of regrowth that is more than 15 years old, and clearing within 50 metres of a waterway in the Great Barrier Reef catchment, will no longer be exempt from the EPBC Act under the “continuous use” exemption.

There is also a “call in” power where the Minister can declare that a project needs Commonwealth approval notwithstanding an approval bilateral, and a requirement that a bilateral assessment agreement must be in place before entering into an approval bilateral.

The water trigger, which was created to deliver federal oversight of water resources for projects like fracking, will be retained by the Federal government instead of being headed back to state and territory governments.

Other wins include:

New national standards on the environment, with legally enforceable rules to protect endangered wildlife and ensure ecologically sustainable development.

New rules for emissions reporting on big polluting companies

Excluding specific threatened species from being offset through the Restoration Fund.

Five yearly reviews to ensure the laws are delivering for communities and the environment.

The state and territory conservation councils created a joint position on the draft bills as part of the current Senate Inquiry, against which we have assessed the new deal.

Environment Centre NT Executive Director Dr Kirsty Howey said:

“While some wins have been clawed back in negotiations with the Greens, the Albanese Government has missed a golden opportunity to secure laws that genuinely safeguard Australia’s nature and climate for generations to come.

“Grassroots community and environment groups have had to fight tooth and nail to win concessions from Labor, including retaining federal approval of the water trigger to stop fracking companies from destroying our waterways.”

Conservation Council WA Executive Director, Matt Roberts, said:

“We welcome changes to stop the fast-tracking of coal and gas, but this should never have been on the table in the first place.”

“We’re concerned that these laws will enable the handing of powers to state and territory governments who’ve been shown they can’t be trusted to protect our nature and climate. It is imperative that the federal government retain decision-making powers for destructive projects like the North-West Shelf and Browse Basin.”

Conservation Council of the ACT Executive Director, Simon Copland, said:

“The elephant in the room is the huge power these laws vest in the Minister, including to override environmental protections in the national interest and make sweeping rulings. This unacceptably undermines key wins.”

“We also oppose the fast-tracking of mining, housing and deforestation via the new “streamlined” assessment pathway, which will significantly curtail community rights to have a say in decisions that affect them.”

Nature Conservation Council of NSW CEO, Jacqui Mumford, said:

“With the RFA exemption finally removed, we expect this will mean an end to logging in forests that are critical for threatened species across NSW, such as Greater Glider strongholds and the state’s remaining koala refuges.

“This is the most significant shift in forest policy in a generation and gives the Minns Government a clear mandate to deliver a fair, planned transition out of native forest logging and into sustainable, plantation-based jobs.”

Environment Victoria CEO, Jono la Nauze, said:

“For the first time in history we will have a national Environment Protection Agency with the power to enforce the laws that protect Australia’s unique plants and wildlife. This could be undermined, however, if a future government hands decision-making powers back to state governments through proposed devolution measures.”

Environment Tasmania CEO, James Overington, said:

“We applaud the persistence of the Greens and also to the members of the ALP who would’ve pushed hard for nature from the inside. At long last, we will see the end of exemptions for the logging industry. Communities in Tasmania have fought for these changes for decades, and must be congratulated for securing this important win.”

Conservation Council of SA CEO, Kirsty Bevan, said:

“We welcome the creation of a new EPA with strong enforcement powers, and the introduction of national standards. The effectiveness of these changes will largely depend on Labor following through with the creation of strong, enforceable standards on matters of national environmental significance.

As the most downstream Basin state, South Australia bears the full consequences of cumulative water extraction, contamination and climate-driven flow reductions and leaving alone the water trigger is a huge relief for South Australia’s communities, industries and internationally recognised Ramsar wetlands in the Coorong and Lower Lakes.”

Queensland Conservation Council Acting Director, Anthony Gough, said:

“For too long we have witnessed record high deforestation rates that have gone unchecked under broken nature laws. These reforms mark a major milestone on the long-fought community campaign to protect Queensland’s forests from out of control land clearing that impacts the Great Barrier Reef.”",https://environmentvictoria.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kuark_forest2_Oct_2017.png,N,,2025-11-27 16:00:19.839368

The Trump administration said this rule will affect hundreds of oil and gas sources nationwide and save an estimated $750 million in compliance costs over roughly a decade.

“By finalizing compliance extensions, EPA is ensuring unrealistic regulations do not prevent America from unleashing energy dominance,” said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin in a statement.

Methane is a potent greenhouse gas that warms the planet 80 times more than carbon dioxide in the short term. Oil and gas operations are the nation’s top industrial source of methane, and the Biden era rules were designed to reduce its emissions, as well as those of volatile organic compounds including benzene, a known carcinogen.

Environmental activists criticized the ruling. “This delay risks the health of millions of Americans living near oil and gas production and undermines progress by industry leaders,” said Rosalie Winn, lead counsel for methane and clean air policy at the Environmental Defense Fund.

The EPA first announced over the summer that it would be delaying pieces of the methane standards in an interim final rule, triggering a legal challenge by EDF and other green groups that is still pending.

Although the EPA’s update of the rule is limited to pushing back multiple compliance deadlines set in the original 2024 version, the agency has said it may reconsider more substantial parts of the rule later.

This is the latest example of President Donald Trump’s EPA rolling back industrial pollution controls set by the previous administration. In recent months, the agency has proposed giving coal-fired power plants more time to meet existing deadlines to regulate wastewater and delaying the phase-down of highly potent greenhouse gases used in refrigerators and air conditioners.",https://www.worldoil.com/media/14460/gas_flare_at_night_1_jf_tt.jpg,N,,2025-11-27 12:03:38.770406

The reforms stem from Professor Graeme Samuel AC’s 2020 independent review of the EPBC Act, which was presented to then-environment minister and now Opposition Leader Sussan Ley. The reform package is centred around three pillars: stronger environmental protection and restoration, more efficient and robust project approvals, and greater accountability and transparency in environmental decision making.

Key environmental measures in the Government’s amended Bill:

Australia will have a National Environment Protection Agency (EPA) – a strong, independent regulator with a clear focus on ensuring better compliance with and stronger enforcement of Australia’s new environmental laws.

Australia will have National Environmental Standards, to ensure clear, strong guidelines to protect the environment.

Higher penalties for the most significant breaches of environmental law, as well as environment protection orders for use in urgent circumstances to prevent and respond to major contraventions of the law.

Removing and sunsetting the exemption from the EPBC Act for high-risk land clearing and regional forest agreements, so that they comply with the same rules and standards as other industries.

Requiring proponents of large emitting projects to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions and their emission reduction plans.

Maintaining federal approval of “water trigger” coal and gas projects.

Key measures to speed up decision-making for business and the community: Stronger Environmental Protection and Restoration

A new Streamlined Assessment Pathway, to significantly reduce the timeframe for proponents who provide sufficient information upfront, providing incentive to meet the standards upfront. This will deliver faster decisions, saving businesses time and money.

New and improved bilateral agreements with states to remove duplication for the assessment and approval of projects.

Regional planning, to deliver ‘go’ and ‘no go’ zones, delivering greater certainty to business, and future planning at a landscape scale, rather than project-by-project assessment.

Clarifying definitions of “unacceptable impacts” and “net gain” for the environment and restraining the operation of Environmental Protection Orders.

WA Premier Roger Cook has received assurances from Minister Watt that Western Australia will be the first state to sign a bilateral agreement for assessment and approvals.

“Every day national methane rules are delayed means more methane in the air, more toxic pollution in our lungs, and more irreversible climate damage.""
Methane can leak from oil and gas wells, pipelines, and other fossil fuel infrastructure, and companies often intentionally release methane through flaring.
While saving money for fossil fuel companies, the delay on the rule could lead to 3.8 million more tons of methane entering the atmosphere, according to the Trump administration's own estimates.
""After years of scientific work and public engagement, this administration’s decision to delay methane pollution standards implementation yet again is a blatant act of climate denial and disregard for public health.","With methane more than 28 times as potent as carbon at trapping heat in the atmosphere in a 100-year period, climate experts agree that reducing methane leaks from oil and gas fields would be one of the fastest and most effective ways of making a measurable impact on planetary heating—but President Donald Trump's Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday flatly refused to do so, instead announcing a delay on a requirement for fossil fuel companies to limit methane emissions.

The Biden administration had introduced the requirement for oil and gas firms to begin reducing their emissions this year, but the EPA said companies will now have until January 2027 to comply with the rule. The administration is also considering repealing the requirement entirely.

Lauren Pagel, policy director for Earthworks, called the delay ""indefensible and illegal.""

""The Trump administration has once again chosen polluters over people, sacrificing the health of communities and climate to serve the fossil fuel industry,"" said Pagel. “Every day national methane rules are delayed means more methane in the air, more toxic pollution in our lungs, and more irreversible climate damage.""

The EPA claimed it was providing companies with a ""more realistic timeline"" for complying with the requirement, and said the action would ""save an estimated $750 million over 11 years in compliance costs.""

Methane can leak from oil and gas wells, pipelines, and other fossil fuel infrastructure, and companies often intentionally release methane through flaring. The fossil fuel industry is the largest industrial source of methane emissions in the US, where emissions of methane have risen sharply in recent years as the Biden administration oversaw record production of oil and gas, even as it sought to reduce emissions through the methane requirement and other regulations.

While saving money for fossil fuel companies, the delay on the rule could lead to 3.8 million more tons of methane entering the atmosphere, according to the Trump administration's own estimates.

""After years of scientific work and public engagement, this administration’s decision to delay methane pollution standards implementation yet again is a blatant act of climate denial and disregard for public health. The EPA’s job is to protect people, not pad the pockets of oil and gas executives,"" said Pagel.

In addition to contributing to global heating and the extreme flooding, hurricanes, heatwaves, and other destructive weather events that come with it, methane emissions are linked to higher ground-level ozone pollution made up of tiny particles that can cause respiratory and cardiac problems, cancer, and strokes.

Grace Smith, senior attorney at the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), noted that the methane standards have already been working ""to reduce pollution, protect people’s health, and prevent the needless waste of American energy""—progress that will now be reversed by EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and Trump.

“The rule released today means millions of Americans will be exposed to dangerous pollution for another year and a half, for no good reason,” said Smith. “Delaying the methane standards threatens people’s health and undermines progress by industry leaders.”

“What’s more, the Trump administration rushed to push through this harmful rule without meaningful transparency or a chance for the public to weigh in,” added Smith. “EDF is already in court challenging EPA’s first attempt to delay these vital protections. We will continue to oppose the rule released today, so that people can breathe cleaner air.”

EDF and the grassroots group Moms Clean Air Force expressed particular concern over nearly 18 million people in the US who live near active oil and gas wells.

""Children in my community and across the nation need a strong and comprehensive oil and gas methane rule as soon as possible,"" said Patrice Tomcik, senior national field director for Moms Clean Air Force.

EDF noted that ""proven, cost-effective solutions are available to help oil and gas operators meet the standards while reducing waste and monetary losses,"" and both large and small producers have expressed support for the federal methane regulation as fossil fuel-producing states have begun implementing the standards.

The rule announced Wednesday, said EDF, ""ignores the strong opposition to the rule from members of impacted communities and wide variety of other Americans.""",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=62251385&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C416%2C0%2C417,N,,2025-11-27 16:00:26.821348

Although the report spans politics, transport and finance, many of its findings point to a profound pressure point for infrastructure planners: electricity demand is climbing faster than expected, and data centres are now a central factor.

The report opens with a stark assessment of global climate politics, describing a “period of retrenchment” driven by the re-elected Trump administration.

The US has withdrawn from the Paris Agreement and moved to limit the federal government’s authority to regulate greenhouse gases.

Generation estimates these reversals have already cancelled nearly US$30bn of prospective clean industry investment, with lost investment possibly reaching US$500bn over a decade if current modelling holds.

Power strain intensifies as demand climbs

Across markets, clean technologies are scaling, but Generation stresses that electricity consumption is rising at close to 4% annually.

The report attributes this to the combined growth of EVs, heat pumps, data centres and air conditioning systems.

The rise in data centre development, fuelled by AI and high-density compute, is specifically called out as one of the drivers pushing global electricity demand to new record levels.

This rapid load growth is slowing the decline of fossil generation. Coal’s share of the global mix is shrinking, yet the absolute amount burned is close to historic highs because overall demand is so strong.

In China and India, coal plants remain heavily utilised even as both countries accelerate renewable energy deployment.

Solar and battery storage continue to lead new energy installations. Global solar generation rose 28.3%, with China adding more capacity in a single month than any other country has ever built in an entire year.

Battery systems are shifting the shape of the grid in markets such as California, where storage now meets roughly 20% of peak evening demand on some days. But Generation notes that even these gains are being absorbed by rising load requirements.

A shifting geopolitical landscape

The report argues that China is emerging as the leading force in clean technology because of an assertive industrial strategy and soaring exports of renewables and electric vehicles.

China’s emissions may be nearing their peak ahead of its 2030 target, and Generation labels the country a potential “electrostate”.

The report’s findings on heavy duty transport infrastructure are also relevant to the data centre sector. It notes that electric lorry charging networks remain “barely-started” in most countries, illustrating the broader gap between political commitments and actual on-the-ground delivery of large-scale power and grid upgrades.

This mirrors the challenges faced by digital infrastructure developers trying to secure substations, high voltage connections and sufficient renewable supply.

Similarly, aviation and shipping remain far from net zero pathways. Europe’s planned mandates for sustainable aviation fuels face financing obstacles, and even if all proposed SAF projects were completed, they would meet only a fraction of long-term demand.

Hydrogen, long promoted as a cross-sector solution, receives a particularly blunt assessment.

Generation argues that the green hydrogen bubble has “truly burst”, with many European projects cancelled or shelved and with widespread acknowledgement that industrial decarbonisation may have been delayed by misplaced enthusiasm.

Milpitas (USA) - SolarEdge reports strong demand in Germany just weeks after the market launch of its commercial CSS-OD storage system. According to the company, more than 150 orders have already been received, totaling over 15?MWh. Twelve systems have already been installed. This opens up a key growth market for the manufacturer, as companies increasingly focus on self-consumption.

The CSS-OD combines a battery cabinet with a capacity of 102.4 kWh and a 50 kW inverter. The solution is scalable up to 1 MWh per site and is suitable for both indoor and outdoor installations. For installers, this creates a new business field, as existing SolarEdge commercial and industrial systems can be easily expanded with storage.

“The market response to the CSS-OD has been exciting, creating a strong new revenue stream that taps into our leading C&I solar business. With many countries in Europe shifting away from net metering and becoming self-consumption markets, the commercial storage segment is steadily growing,” said Naama Ohana, Head of the Commercial & Industrial Division. She added that the strong response to the CSS-OD demonstrates the economic attractiveness of commercial storage solutions. This is further highlighted by record demand for the CSS-OD, which SolarEdge is seeing not only in Germany but across Europe.

One of the first installations took place at the solar installer WG Solar Concept in Baden-Württemberg. The company operates a 280 kWp rooftop system and has installed two CSS-OD units to optimize self-consumption. Managing Director Nils Rufle emphasizes that the system integrates “seamlessly” into the existing PV installation. According to the company, the combination of PV and storage now covers around 95 percent of its own energy needs, including heat pumps and charging infrastructure.

With this early market success, SolarEdge sees its position in the commercial energy storage segment, which is set for significant growth in Europe, strongly reinforced.

SolarEdge shares closed yesterday at €30.98 (26 November 2025, Stuttgart Stock Exchange closing price). Compared with the year-start price, this represents a 138 percent increase. SolarEdge currently ranks second among the top five stocks in the 2025 RENIXX ranking.

Speaking in an interview with Sherzodkhon Kudratkhodja, Alimov emphasized that localization is “a very relevant and important issue,” noting Uzbekistan’s extensive experience in manufacturing automotive components, The Caspian Post reports, citing Uzbek media.

The plant has already localized the production of more than 60 types of parts.

He noted that the first stage focused on localizing the full EV production cycle, and the process has now advanced to components. Local companies are already supplying all major parts, including seats, glass, exterior plastic elements, plastic fuel tanks, floor mats, and other interior accessories.

“As a result, we have significantly reduced production costs, increased added value, and shortened delivery times. When a supplier is located nearby, production efficiency increases. From this perspective, localization is very beneficial,” Alimov said.

Conclusion Taken as a whole, the Autumn Budget 2025 combines tighter, more targeted sectoral taxation with emphasis on certain measures designed to unlock investment.","On 26 November 2025, the Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, delivered her second Budget. Facing a challenging fiscal landscape of stalled economic growth, above-target inflation, and high government borrowing, she emphasised the need to continue efforts to grow the economy and “build the industry of the future"". Stability, investment and reform were key themes of her speech, alongside energy and infrastructure. For businesses operating in the UK’s energy and infrastructure sectors, the Budget signals that the government is prepared to tighten sector-specific tax levers, whilst deploying measures to unlock investment. This publication highlights several of the most relevant measures, and offers initial observations on their implications for sponsors, investors, and lenders.

Oil & Gas and the North Sea Transition

The Chancellor confirmed plans for a new Oil and Gas Price Mechanism (OGPM) to replace the Energy Profits Levy (EPL) which is due to end by March 2030, but could end earlier if the EPL’s price floor (called the “Energy Security Investment Mechanism”) is triggered. Like the levy, the OGPM is intended to act as a windfall tax on upstream oil and gas companies operating in the UK/UKCS and will apply to disposals of oil or gas when the consideration received is unusually high. The new mechanism will be revenue-based and apply an additional tax rate of 35% above price thresholds of $90/barrel for oil and £0.90/therm for gas (indexed to CPI). The OGPM will be a permanent measure, to be introduced in the next Finance Bill after consultation on draft legislation and implementation and coming into effect when the EPL ends. More immediately, legislation will be included in Finance Bill 2025/26 to confirm that no payment under a decommissioning relief deed (DRD) can arise in relation to the EPL for decommissioning expenditure incurred on or after 26 November 2025. The OPGM legislation will also ensure no payments under a DRD regime can be made in respect of the OGPM.

The announcement of a new North Sea Future Plan to support ongoing investment in the North Sea provided a counterpoint for the UK’s offshore industries. The plan envisages that, alongside oil and gas production from existing fields, the North Sea’s energy future will be focused on three key clean energy sectors: offshore wind; carbon capture, usage and storage (CCUS); and hydrogen. As part of this new North Sea strategy, the government will introduce new Transitional Energy Certificates. Administered by the North Sea Transition Authority, they will enable limited oil and gas production on or near existing fields - so long as this additional production does not require new exploration, is already part of, or is adjacent to, existing fields and infrastructure and the activity is necessary for a managed, prosperous and orderly transition.

In relation to refineries, the government is also considering the feasibility and impacts of including refined products in the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) in future.

Reducing Energy Bills

The Chancellor has prioritised lowering energy bills for consumers by removing some social and environmental levies funding a range of schemes. This includes ending the Energy Company Obligation which is currently funded through bills. In addition, the government will fund 75% of the domestic cost of the legacy Renewables Obligation for three years, and extend the £150 Warm Home Discount to a further 3 million of the poorest households. Taken together, these changes mark a modest, but symbolically important shift away from funding legacy low-carbon and social schemes solely through electricity bills and towards broader-based Exchequer funding, easing pressure on electricity prices while reopening questions about who ultimately bears the cost of decarbonisation policies.

In relation to road transport, the government is extending the 5p fuel duty cut until the end of August 2026 with rates then gradually returning to March 2022 levels by March 2027. The planned increase in line with inflation for 2026-27 will also be cancelled. Alongside the introduction of Fuel Finder, these measures are expected to save families £89 next year compared to previous plans.

Support is also offered to industrial energy consumers struggling with the high cost of power. From 2027, the British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will reduce electricity costs by c.£35-40/MWh. In line with the government’s Modern Industrial Strategy, the scheme will benefit manufacturing, electricity intensive frontier industries such as automotive and aerospace, and foundational manufacturing industries in their supply chains, such as chemicals. The Department for Business and Trade launched a consultation in November to determine design and eligibility for the scheme. Under the proposals, eligible business activity would be exempt from the cost of the Renewables Obligation, Feed-in Tariff and Capacity Market schemes (in addition to other support received under measures for energy intensive industries).

Low Carbon Technologies

The government continues to see clean energy and low carbon technologies as drivers of economic growth. Alongside support for hydrogen, CCUS and offshore wind highlighted in the North Sea Future Plan, the Budget makes changes to the treatment of electrolytic hydrogen in the Climate Change Levy (CCL). Following a consultation at Spring Statement 2025, both electricity used in electrolysis to produce hydrogen and natural gas used as a source of CO2 in the production of sodium bicarbonate will be made exempt from CCL costs. Exempting electricity used for electrolysis would improve the operating cost profile of green hydrogen projects. Subject to parliamentary approval, these amendments will be in force by Spring 2026.

In addition, the Chancellor announced that the government is investing £14.5m in Grangemouth, Scotland to support investment opportunities and industrial projects which can create new jobs. The former oil refinery stopped processing crude oil in April, and although the Budget does not set out details, the site has previously been earmarked for redevelopment, including as a low carbon energy hub. Further detail on the delivery model - including any role for the National Wealth Fund or blended finance structures - will be important for investors assessing opportunities linked to CCUS, hydrogen, or wider decarbonisation in the region.

Nuclear

Reflecting its key role in the government’s Clean Energy Superpower Mission, the nuclear sector featured prominently in the Budget. The Green Financing Framework has been updated to include nuclear energy in the list of eligible expenditures for green financing (with some exclusions), including green gilts and retail Green Saving Bonds. The proceeds from sales of green gilts and Green Savings Bonds issued prior to 27 November 2025 will not be allocated to nuclear energy-related expenditures. A Second Party Opinion from S&P reportedly rates the new Framework as dark green, their highest rating, and an improvement on the Framework’s original rating in 2021. For investors, this recognition widens the pool of capital that can treat nuclear-related expenditure as “green” within UK-labelled instruments, aligns the UK more closely with jurisdictions that recognise nuclear as a low-carbon technology, and may over time influence how institutional investors with strict green mandates calibrate their exposure through nuclear assets.

Having reached financial close for the Sizewell C nuclear power plant and announced the UK’s first small modular reactor project at Wylfa in North Wales earlier this month, the government also committed in the Budget to “continue to identify potential sites for large-scale nuclear power”. In addition, responding to recommendations laid out in the Nuclear Regulatory Review 2025 (published by the Nuclear Regulatory Taskforce on 24 November), the government confirmed its aim to present a full implementation plan within three months and to complete sector reforms within the next two years, subject to legislative timelines. These reforms will be designed to “regulate nuclear in a way that promotes better delivery without compromising safety”. For the nuclear supply chain, the combination of a clear reform timetable and an expanded pipeline of large-scale and advanced projects should help derisk investment in skills, manufacturing capacity, and components.

Building on this, the Prime Minister also used the Budget to issue a Strategic Steer, setting out expectations for the civil, defence, and decommissioning sectors to accelerate safe and efficient delivery through proportionate regulation and stronger collaboration. The government wants to avoid a “nuclear gap by enabling existing stations to continue running where demonstrably safe, such as through the potential 20-year lifetime extension of Sizewell B, and by getting Hinkley Point C and Sizewell C online as soon as possible”. An Advanced Nuclear Framework is due to be published shortly to provide a pathway for privately-led advanced nuclear technologies with Great British Energy - Nuclear assessing project proposals, the National Wealth Fund exploring potential investment opportunities and the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) exploring revenue support for viable projects.

Grid

Recognising that connections to the electricity grid remain one of the biggest blockers in delivering key growth projects across the economy, the government notes that it is working with Ofgem and the National Energy System Operator (NESO) to overhaul connection processes. This work is said to include exploring enhanced entry and membership requirements to ensure viable projects progress in the demand queue; reducing the time to power by exploring self-build for high voltage grid infrastructure and more flexible connections where possible; and removing speculative demand in the grid connection queue, with the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) to produce a strategic plan for data centres to ensure only the most strategic and credible projects are taken forward. New powers in the government’s flagship Planning and Infrastructure Bill are also set to create mechanisms to reallocate released capacity and reserve future capacity for strategically important demand projects.

Transport

The Chancellor’s tax-led efforts to generate revenue for the government have been extended to the electric vehicle (EV) sector. A new mileage charge, the Electric Vehicle Excise Duty (eVED), will be introduced at a rate of 3p per mile for battery electric cars and 1.5p for plug-in hybrid cars from April 2028. This will allow the government to invest a further £200m in EV charging points. Drivers will pay for their mileage alongside their existing vehicle excise duty. From 2028, this will begin to erode one of the fiscal advantages of EVs over internal combustion engine vehicles, and will be an important factor in total-cost-of-ownership models for fleet operators and mobility providers.

At the same time, the government has launched a consultation on reforming permitted development rights to make it easier and cheaper to install EV charging infrastructure such as upstands and cross-pavement solutions. It has also said it will review the cost of public EV charging, looking at the impact of energy prices, wider cost contributors, and options for lowering these costs for consumers. The review will start in Q1 2026 and report by Q3 2026.

Noting that ""infrastructure is the backbone of economic growth across our country”, the Chancellor confirmed support for a number of key projects across Great Britain. These include the Docklands Light Rail, which will be extended to Thamesmead, funded by Transport for London and Greater London Authority, “with the government also contributing over the long term”.

The government is also committing a further £891 million to complete the publicly funded works for the Lower Thames Crossing, described as “the largest roadbuilding project for a generation”, improving links between the Midlands, North and ports in the South East. As part of its staged approach, the final tranche of government support will enable the private sector to take forward construction and long-term operation. The government’s preferred financing option at this stage is the Regulated Asset Base (RAB) model. The project will be taken forward on that basis, with formal market engagement launching in 2026. This confirms the government’s willingness to deploy the RAB model in the transport sector, which may be of interest to infrastructure funds and lenders already familiar with the regime from nuclear and other regulated infrastructure.

At Budget, the government also approved the full business case for Forth Green Freeport, which aims to leverage £7.9 billion of investment over 10 years and create up to 16,000 direct jobs. A Memorandum of Understanding can now be signed with the Scottish Government, enabling the release of £25 million of government seed capital funding. Green energy and advanced manufacturing businesses located on the Freeport’s tax sites will benefit from a range of tax reliefs and incentives. The Freeport will boost UK production of clean energy and sustainable fuels, including offshore wind energy.

In relation to aviation, the government is making rapid progress in enabling the delivery of an operational third runway at Heathrow by 2035. In October, the Department for Transport launched a review of the Airports National Policy Statement (ANPS) and in November identified the scheme promoted by Heathrow Airport Ltd as the scheme to take forward to inform the ongoing review of the ANPS. The government will consult on any amendments to the ANPS by July 2026. The Budget also affirmed that “Heathrow expansion will be entirely privately financed, with no cost to the taxpayer”.

Other measures have been designed to offer support to transport users. These include the introduction of a one-year freeze of regulated rail fares – for the first time in 30 years – saving commuters on the more expensive routes more than £300 per year. As mentioned above, the Chancellor has also chosen to continue the freeze on fuel duty until September 2026 and retain the temporary 5p cut introduced by the previous government at the start of the war in Ukraine.

Social and defence infrastructure

Beyond transport infrastructure, the Budget restated the government’s commitment to invest in new infrastructure across sectors such as social housing, health, education and defence. It announced plans for 250 new Neighbourhood Health Centres and upgrades to existing buildings through a combination of public sector investment and a new model of Public-Private Partnerships (currently being developed by the National Infrastructure and Service Transformation Authority). Privately financed projects and programmes – including PPPs – will also be considered for projects that decarbonise the public sector estate.

With regard to the defence sector, the government plans to invest in accommodation with £1.5bn this Parliament and a total of £9bn over the next decade. It also aims to identify potential sites for the construction of 13 new munitions factories.

Across education, the government has committed to expanding the School Rebuilding Programme, providing almost £20 billion investment from 2025‑26 to 2034-35.

The government will continue to consider the ways in which private finance can support the delivery of wider infrastructure ambitions including leveraging private finance to help deliver the next generation of new towns.

Digital infrastructure

In addition to its support for previously announced AI Growth Zones, the government notes that it is investing up to £2 billion between now and 2030 to build a modern public compute ecosystem, ensuring that this country’s start-up and research and development communities have the necessary access to cutting-edge public compute. This includes over £1 billion to expand the AI Research Resource programme 20 times by 2030, up to £750 million for a new national supercomputer service at the Edinburgh Parallel Computing Centre (due to come online in 2027), and an up to £100 million advance market commitment to purchase novel compute.

Other measures

The government will launch a Strategic Asset Review to report before the next spending review, which will identify opportunities to monetise assets and address barriers to disposals. Both this and the value-for-money review into the maintenance of public sector assets will be informed by the Balance Sheet Framework, setting out for the first time a comprehensive approach to managing the assets and liabilities that the government holds on behalf of the taxpayer. Alongside this, HS2 Ltd is undertaking a sprint project that aims to identify and unlock opportunities for early release of land currently held for HS2 between London and Birmingham, around its stations and depot hub. This work is part of the reset of the HS2 programme and will support both regeneration and economic growth.

Conclusion

Taken as a whole, the Autumn Budget 2025 combines tighter, more targeted sectoral taxation with emphasis on certain measures designed to unlock investment. For energy and infrastructure sector participants, the immediate task is to map these measures against project and portfolio pipelines - from upstream oil and gas, hydrogen, CCUS, and nuclear, through grid, transport, and social infrastructure, to digital and data centre investments - and to position early for the consultations, funding streams, and regulatory changes that will determine which projects move fastest in the next phase of the UK’s transition and growth story.",https://www.slaughterandmay.com/media/mnmdelgq/default-share.jpg,N,,2025-11-27 13:02:09.645813

Proceeds from this round will be used to scale manufacturing capacity to 3 GWh, set up an automated facility for electric four-wheelers at Chakan near Pune, deepen research and development, and fuel domestic as well as international expansion.

The company is currently targeting a revenue of INR 200 Cr for the year, with future projections set at INR 900 Cr, as it aims to further its position in the rapidly growing Indian EV market.

Founded by CEO Pratik Kamdar, Neuron Energy offers a comprehensive range of electric mobility solutions, including lead-acid, advanced lithium-ion, and sodium-ion batteries.

Earlier focussed on two-wheeler EV batteries, Neuron is now expanding into batteries for four-wheelers and buses, emphasising high-quality, rigorously tested lithium-ion and next-gen sodium-ion solutions.

Neuron Energy last raised INR 20 Cr (about $2.3 Mn) in its Series A funding round from existing investor Chona Family Office and Capri Global Family Office last year. Prior to that, it raised INR 20 Cr in a pre-Series A round led by Equanimity Investments and the Rajiv Dadlani Group.

Including the Pre Series B round, Neuron Energy has raised INR 80 Cr till date.

The development comes at a time when EV and EV battery startups in India are seeing strong growth as the demand for cleaner mobility and energy-efficient transportation rises.

These companies are not just assembling vehicles but developing new solutions such as longer-lasting lithium-ion batteries, advanced battery management systems, battery swapping networks and charging infrastructure tailored for Indian conditions.

With government incentives, falling battery prices and increasing adoption of electric two- and three-wheelers, the ecosystem has become fertile for innovation. Investors are also backing the sector as both consumer demand and industrial applications expand.

EV major Ola Electric recently shifted its focus to battery manufacturing with rollouts of its own in-house 4680 “Bharat Cell” lithium ion batteries. The company is also eyeing to vertically integrate cell production to bring down its EV costs and reduce reliance on imports.

The Energy Assessment Tool (EAT) supports Google’s wider push to cut emissions and improve efficiency across its supply chain, including within its own data centre network.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) refers to energy efficiency as the “first fuel” in clean energy transitions due to its role in delivering fast and effective CO₂ reductions.

In data centres, where energy demand continues to rise alongside AI workloads, efficiency measures help operators reduce environmental impact while managing costs.

Kate Brandt, Google’s Chief Sustainability Officer, writes on LinkedIn: “We’re launching a tool that I wish I had access to early in my career as a sustainability leader.

“By equipping our partners with the right resources, we can accelerate progress, reduce costs and build a more efficient and resilient supply chain for everyone.”

Energy Assessment Tool for non-experts

Google’s EAT is designed to remove the common barriers that prevent energy efficiency projects from being implemented.

These include high consultancy costs, limited funding and a lack of internal expertise.

By targeting facility and plant managers, the platform encourages basic assessments without the need for a site visit or background in energy engineering.

The tool provides custom recommendations based on information such as facility size, equipment type and operational hours.

It covers more than 20 system categories including air compressors, lighting, boilers and chillers. In doing so, it offers insights that would typically require a professional audit, aligned to the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Level 1 standard.

Google confirms that the tool is powered by calculation methods and datasets developed by engineering firms with long-standing industry knowledge. That means facility operators can run assessments that would normally be out of reach without investment in external consultants.

The system is designed to support multiple languages including Chinese (simplified and traditional), Vietnamese, Thai and English, with plans to extend access across key manufacturing and industrial regions.

Individual supplier data remains private and confidential. Google confirms the platform is managed by a third party and reviewed to meet its internal privacy and security requirements.

Facility managers and suppliers can choose which partners to collaborate with and what data to share, such as potential energy and cost savings.

Extending energy efficiency across data centres

Although the tool is aimed at manufacturing and supply chain partners, Google also applies the same principles to its own data centres.

These sites are among the most efficient globally, and the company continues to reduce the energy intensity of its infrastructure.

Google’s custom-built AI chips have improved in power efficiency over time, helping it deliver larger workloads with reduced energy input.

In terms of cooling, Google has adopted methods like direct-to-chip systems to reduce the reliance on traditional air conditioning and minimise water use. It also integrates native planting and restoration projects around data centre locations to support biodiversity and local ecosystems.

Google includes energy efficiency in a wider sustainability strategy, which also covers responsible water use, circular design in consumer products and hardware repairability.

The company works toward minimising waste in its operations and promoting reuse of materials where possible.

As a leading corporate buyer of clean energy, Google already procures large-scale renewable power and is investing in early-stage technologies such as advanced nuclear, enhanced geothermal and grid-support innovations.

“We’ll be getting millions of tons of pollution without any of the benefit.” State officials and the Homer City project’s developers view the project far differently.
State environmental officials issued the air quality permit, after indicating the proposed facility meets regulatory guidelines – including those restricting greenhouse gas emissions.
“Receiving air quality plan approval is a major milestone for our team, our partners, and the entire region,” said Corey Hessen, CEO of Homer City Generation.
DEP officials approved a plan that added 53 new conditions beyond the standard state air quality regulations, state officials said this fall.","HOMER CITY, Pa. – A Philadelphia- based environmental group may appeal a Department of Environmental Protection decision set to award an air quality permit for a proposed $10 billion Indiana County “energy campus” data center.

Even while requiring Homer City Development to increase some additional monitoring measures, the state’s “fast-tracked” permit will allow an alarming level of “volatile organic compounds” into the environment – for very little benefit, Clean Air Council Executive Director Alex Bomstein said.

“These are compounds that contribute to smog and ozone issues,” Bomstein said. “Any over time, they can lead to all kinds of health issues.”

For all of its foul pollution, Homer City’s previous coal-fired power plant was capable of generating enough power to support up to 2 million homes, he said.

“This (new) plant isn’t being designed to heat homes and run the lights in Pennsylvania. It’s primarily going to run an AI data center to relieve people of their jobs,” he said.

“We’ll be getting millions of tons of pollution without any of the benefit.”

State officials and the Homer City project’s developers view the project far differently.

State environmental officials issued the air quality permit, after indicating the proposed facility meets regulatory guidelines – including those restricting greenhouse gas emissions.

Project developers, meanwhile, say the up to 4.4 gigawatt facility will transform the community by creating approximately 200 “high-paying jobs” and leading to hundreds more to support the business in Indiana County, planners said.

Approximately 3,000 laborers in the trades will likely be needed to build the power generating station and data center on 3,200 acres approximately 26 miles northwest of Johnstown.

“Receiving air quality plan approval is a major milestone for our team, our partners, and the entire region,” said Corey Hessen, CEO of Homer City Generation. “We truly appreciate the efforts of both Governor Shapiro’s office, which helped move this process forward, and the expert team at PA DEP, who diligently reviewed our application to ensure that the project would proceed in full compliance with Pennsylvania’s air quality regulations.”

The facility will also be designed to produce energy for the power grid. But AI, or artificial intelligence, technology requires massive amounts of electricity and the project’s primary intent is to help feed that need, developers have said.

Environmental groups worry the technology – and data centers they require – will drive up the cost of electricity.

Bomstein noted that groups like the Clean Air Council have 30 days to file an appeal to the permit – and other regulatory hurdles must be cleared before the project can go to construction.

The high level of carbons that would be emitted into the air by the plant – not just over Pennsylvania but across multiple states – are one key concern, he said.

If these ranges rise to the maximum the state allows, we could be talking about $508 million in health-(related) harms annually ... from this pollution,” Bomstein said.

He estimated the projected cost in “health” harms at up to $211 million in Pennsylvania.

The Homer City project’s planners have said the new plant will cut greenhouse emissions by 65% compared to the previous plant, which was known as a top polluter in Pennsylvania.

Bomstein said it’s clear certain pollutants, such as Sulphur dioxide emissions, would drop.

But the potential level of ammonia – the same substance found in products such as window cleaner – would rise substantially if they reach permitted levels, he said, citing eye and respiratory dangers.

He said those levels could exceed legal limits. The Clean Air Council wants to see more steps taken to ensure excessive amounts of the substance aren’t being emitted into the environment.

Bomstein credited Department of Environmental Protection officials for requiring increased testing of the emissions that will rise from the plant’s towering stacks.

As initially outlined, that certain pollution would have been measured every five years. The DEP will instead require it every three years, he said.

DEP officials approved a plan that added 53 new conditions beyond the standard state air quality regulations, state officials said this fall.

That includes requiring that the “best available control” measures be used in the future and to enhance certain record-keeping and post start-up testing measures, a notice in the Pa. Bulletin shows.

But there are still a number of other complaints that weren’t addressed, he added.

“This is just something you can’t let go,” Bomstein said.

The facility will enable the early injection of 155 MW from the first phase of the 900-MW Ummbila Emoyeni project.

The project anchors the energy transition of Mpumalanga, South Africa’s coal-dependent industrial region.

South Africa seeks to modernize and strengthen its grid as it accelerates its energy transition. The strategy relies on new transmission infrastructure capable of integrating larger volumes of renewable electricity.

Renewable-energy company Seriti Green, a subsidiary of Seriti Resources, and state utility Eskom announced on Wednesday, November 26, that they officially handed over the Vunumoya transmission station, a facility built in 18 months for more than USD 58 million.

The companies stated that engineers have fully energized the station and connected it to the national grid.

The station will enable the early injection of 155 MW from the first phase of the Ummbila Emoyeni wind-and-solar program. Seriti Green will deliver 900 MW once the entire project reaches completion.

Seriti CEO Mike Teke said: “The handover of the Vunumoya transmission station today shows what an effective partnership can accomplish. It represents a significant step for South Africa’s energy transition and for the future of Mpumalanga as a renewable-energy hub. Seriti is proud to contribute to infrastructure that supports a safer and more sustainable national energy system.”

The station and the 900-MW program sit in Mpumalanga, the historical center of South Africa’s coal industry. The region hosts a large share of the country’s coal-fired power plants and therefore plays a central role in the national decarbonization agenda.

The project carries symbolic and strategic weight for the country. South Africa has pledged to reduce its dependence on coal and recently outlined a long-term electricity plan in which low-carbon sources will overtake coal for the first time.

The PPA term begins January 2026 and will cover the supply of 1,000GWh of electricity each year to power Codelco’s mining operations.
In turn, this has led to the adoption of energy storage technologies, primarily for energy shifting applications and with typical durations of 4-hour or 5-hour.

In April, Generadora Metropolitano announced that a 15-year power purchase agreement (PPA) had been signed with Chilean mining company Codelco for the supply of 100% renewable energy from the Dune Plus facilities.

The PPA term begins January 2026 and will cover the supply of 1,000GWh of electricity each year to power Codelco’s mining operations. The company has awarded more than 3,000GWh of annual contracts for renewables in the past two years and is targeting 100% electricity supply from renewable sources by 2030.

The Atacama Desert region has some of the highest annual solar irradiation levels in the world, making it a prime location for solar PV development and has enabled Chile to become one of the leading adopters of the technology in Latin America.

In turn, this has led to the adoption of energy storage technologies, primarily for energy shifting applications and with typical durations of 4-hour or 5-hour.

At the Energy Storage Summit Latin America 2025 in September, Ana Lía Rojas, executive director at the Chilean renewable energy and energy storage association (ACERA), said that in 2024, 2.2TWh of new solar PV generation was added to the national grid, but curtailment of solar increased by 2.7TWh.

Chile is adopting energy storage technologies so quickly that then-energy minister Diego Pardow Lorenzo said at the summit, hosted by our publisher Solar Media in the national capital Santiago, that the country will surpass its 2GW by 2030 BESS deployment policy target by January next year, and its 2050 target of 6GW by 2027.

The Antofagasta region, meanwhile, is rich in mineral wealth and one of the world’s most significant mining areas for copper and lithium.

Generadora Metropolitano launched with the acquisition of four backup power plants from AES Gener, the regional subsidiary of AES Corporation, in 2018. Two diesel-fired power plants in that portfolio have since been closed. The company, now focused on low-carbon technologies has to date developed four PV plants in the country with 1,030MW total generation capacity.

Dune Plus marks the first battery storage projects for the JV between French state-owned power company EDF and Chilean developer AME.

Financing for Dune Plus has been closed with backing from international banks BNP Paribas Securities, Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, MUFG, Societe General and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking, under a non-recourse project finance structure. Another bank, Banco de Crédito e Inversiones, granted a loan for Value Added Tax (VAT).",https://www.energy-storage.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/generadora-metropolitano_ceme1-scaled-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-27 09:58:20.144648

WTI oil price was revised $2/b higher in 2026 than last month’s STEO.

Refinery margin (profits) are expected to increase in 2025 and 2026 for both gasoline and diesel fuel.

Natural gas prices for residential consumers are expected to rise only by 2% this winter to $13.80/MCF.

A warmer winter is expected in 2025/2026 leading to lower consumption of natural gas compared to last winter.

Growth in electric power consumption is concentrated in the West South Central Region (Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Arkansas) with 34% of all US growth coming from this region in 2025 and 66% in 2026. For the US as a whole electricity sales increase by 2.4% in 2025 and by 2.6% in 2026.

OECD stocks rise to the early 2021 level by the end of 2026.

US natural gas output jumps by 5.1 BCF/d in 2025 (4.4%).

Consumption of natural gas rises by 1.3% in 2025 and is roughly flat in 2026.

Most of the increased natural gas output is exported with exports increasing by 4.5 BCF/d from 2024 to 2026, an increase of 36% over 2 years (a 26.4% increase in 2025 and a 7.6% increase in 2026 natural gas exports).

For the past 12 months tight oil output has been pretty flat.

In the Permian scenarios above I try to match the AEO 2025 reference case for the Southwest region with non-Permian C+C and Permian conventional oil deducted (about 800 kb/d for 2024 to 2050). The Permian Garzon case uses analysis by Jorge Garzon from Novi Labs on Tier 1 and Tier 2 remaining locations in the Permian Basin to arrive at a total of 107 thousand wells. For that scenario low oil prices are assumed (under $70/b in 2025 $) so that lower tier locations are not profitable to drill and complete. The medium scenario assumes higher oil prices up to $85/b in 2025$ so that some tier 3 and lower wells are completed (about 33 thousand of them). The high scenario assumes even higher prices (perhaps up to $120/b in 2025$) with another 42 thousand wells more than the medium scenario completed. Note that about 55 thousand wells had been completed by June 30, 2025.

In the grand scheme there are about 1500 Gb of remaining C+C global resources so the difference of 21 Gb between the low and high Permian scenarios is small, less than 1.5% of remaining crude oil resources. Note that from 2012 to 2024 about 95% of the increase in World C+C came from Permian Basin tight oil (5080 of 5341 kb/d of the World C+C increase from 2012 to 2024). Chart below shows World C+C minus Permian tight oil from 2012 to 2024, which increased by 261 kb/d over that period or an annual average rate of 22 kb/d.",,N,,2025-11-27 14:03:18.223129

It set a record as one of the fastest-charging EVs using the public charging network. The test, conducted independently by Lotus Al Ghanim, the official Lotus dealer in Kuwait, utilized Lotus’ ultra-fast 450kW DC charger. The Emeya reached a peak charging power of 443kW, allowing it to charge from 10% to 80% in just 13 minutes and 35 seconds.

Lotus said the Emeya uses a cell-to-pack battery structure that packs 20% more cells into the same space than a standard module design. Additionally, it employs a new cooling system architecture to enhance battery thermal performance and efficiency.

Lotus Emeya Charging System

The vehicle is equipped with an 800-volt charging system. It is designed to provide rapid charging and improved efficiency regardless of the charger in use. This technology is also present in the Lotus Eletre, the company’s hyper-SUV.

Lotus said it aims to simplify EV ownership by instilling confidence in drivers to embark on long-distance journeys. With a WLTC energy consumption of 18.7kWh/100km, the Emeya can deliver up to 310 km (192 miles) of range within 10 minutes. The 2026 model year Emeya boasts a WTLP range of up to 379 miles.

The company is implementing a fully integrated charging ecosystem. It said this offers a seamless experience through the Lotus Cars app and Lotus HyperOS. This system provides EV routing to help drivers locate nearby public chargers, reducing range anxiety and potentially decreasing travel times. It can also suggest alternative routes based on real-time battery consumption, optimizing the Lotus EV driving experience.

In generations past, bubbles of overbuilding in railroads and fiberoptic networks and even gas turbines took years to absorb, and bankrupted plenty of operators.","Tech giants want to double A.I. electricity consumption in 5 years by enough to power more than 30 million homes. America can do it.

Between now and 2030, the giants of A.I. like OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Meta aim to more than double the computing power dedicated to growing and operating their non-human minds. They currently use about 40 gigawatts of power, enough for 30 million homes.

The cost of this ambition will be astronomical — about $50 billion per gigawatt of computing power built for a total of $2.5 trillion over the next five years alone. Roughly 80% of that will go to buy GPUs made by the likes of Nvidia and AMD; the rest — some $500 billion — will provide the energy via new power plants and transmission lines.

At the trajectory these hyperscalers are on, Goldman Sachs figures that by 2030 American datacenters will consume 500 terawatt hours per year — more than 10% of total domestic electricity. “I think we should already be raising the alarm on the potential for facilities to complete construction but be without power in 2028 and 2029,” says Zach Krause, an analyst at East Daley, a Denver energy consultancy. “I hope they don’t march into a wall.”

Some already have. In Oregon, Amazon Data Services has filed a complaint against Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary Pacificorp, which has refused to provide power to energize some of Amazon's $30 billion in data center investments there. In Santa Clara, Calif. two 50 megawatt centers developed by Digital Realty and Stack Infrastructure are ready to go but can’t get electricity until Silicon Valley Power completes $450 million in grid upgrades – not expected until 2028 or later. Faced with new demand for 30 gigawatts of power, utility AES in Ohio told developers they had to enter into long term contracts to buy 85% of the power they want. (The queue dropped by more than half to just 13 GW).

Amid the doomsday scenarios are optimists. Joseph Majkut, director of energy security at CSIS, writes in a new report that this is a nice problem for the United States to face, and overcome: “Rapid demand growth should be good news. Despite trade conflicts and macroeconomic uncertainty, the United States is positioned to power more economic growth and strategic industries than we’ve seen in decades.”

“A lot of people are saying power is the constraint. Increasingly we believe that is not necessarily true,” says Carson Kearl, power markets analyst at Enverus in Calgary. He thinks building enough, fast enough shouldn’t be a problem. ""The initial reaction is one of disbelief,"" he says. ""But there's a lot of excess capacity in the market,"" if you locate your project in the right place.

Alex Tang of VC firm 50 Years agrees. ""If a hyperscaler has committed to it, it's going to happen,"" says Tang, who has invested in nuclear, batteries and solar startups. ""We are one of the most efficient capital markets. We have shifted on a dime and can stand up a massive effort."" According to federal data the U.S. built 40 GW of new power plants in 2023, and is on track to erect 63 GW this year — half of which will be solar panels.

Plenty of datacenter developers are taking the situation into their own hands, building their own power generation on site rather than relying on utility companies to hook them up. These ""behind-the-meter"" generators are especially prevalent in Texas, which has its own power grid that isn't subject to federal regulatory oversight enabling easier permitting. In Abilene, Texas, the Stargate project being developed by OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle and investment firm MGX is building 10 gas turbines to serve as backup power.

Unexpected entrants into this space include the big oil companies, which aim to arbitrage the price difference of their low-value gas against high-value electricity. Chevron plans to build 5 GW of gas turbines for datacenters by 2027 in the Permian Basin of Texas where gas is so plentiful that prices at the Waha pipeline hub have gone negative this year. Giant oil companies, which already operate dozens of power plants at their refineries, will be able to lean on vendors for utility-scale turbines.

Others face 4-year wait times for big turbines from the likes of G.E. Vernova, Siemens and Hitachi. So they have turned to other options. Private equity giant Brookfield inked a $5 billion deal with Bloom Energy for their fuel cells that run on gas. Meanwhile, Elon Musk's xAI, for its Memphis, Tennessee data center, has deployed dozens of smaller gas turbines (~30 megawatts) procured from Caterpillar subsidiary Solar Turbines. Kearl at Enverus thinks developers will be able to source an impressive 25 GW a year of smaller-size gas generators.

Natural gas will power about 60% of all this new datacenter demand, says Goldman Sachs. Such a domestic natural gas building boom is not unprecedented. According to the Energy Information Administration, in 2002 developers added 57 GW of gas turbines to the grid, led by independent power producer Calpine, which subsequently went bankrupt in 2005 due to surging natural gas prices amid tight supplies. (The company is now being acquired by Constellation Energy).

Demand from A.I. could even give coal a second life. Usage has ticked up in the past year as Trump’s EPA has proposed to repeal Biden-era anti-coal rules. Officials in Pueblo County, Colorado recently asked Xcel Energy to delay the closingCK of two coal plants until replacements have been found.

Longer term, a renaissance in nuclear power will also ensure ample electricity. Meta, Microsoft and Amazon have all contracted for years of power from decades-old nuclear reactors, and Constellation Energy even landed a federal loan guarantee to restart a mothballed reactor at Three Mile Island.

New nukes are in the works as well. Westinghouse and Brookfield landed federal backing to build $80 billion of new AP1000 reactors, while a dozen startups are working on new small modular reactors. Trump’s energy secretary Chris Wright wants to see nuclear reactors and datacenters built on federally owned lands, particularly military installations that could benefit from redundant power supplies in exchange for easy permitting.

International energy consultancy WoodMackenzie, forecasts that A.I. will help find even more energy than it uses. The firm took decades of data on 2,500 of the world’s biggest oil and gas fields, then fed it into a proprietary A.I. Using “integrative modeling,” the A.I. showed how the industry could boost global oil reserves by 500 billion barrels by applying best techniques to newer fields.

Likewise, Rocky Mountain Institute says plenty more power can be unlocked (50 GW or more) by increasing grid efficiencies, upgrading high-voltage transmission lines, and creating so-called “demand response” programs, where big customers agree to curtail electricity use during times of peak demand. Researchers at Duke University figure that if datacenter operators agreed to dial back power use during just 1% of their expected uptime, it would have the effect of giving the power grid “curtailment-enabled headroom” to the tune of 125 GW.

It's easy to be a naysayer. In generations past, bubbles of overbuilding in railroads and fiberoptic networks and even gas turbines took years to absorb, and bankrupted plenty of operators. But this isn't subprime lending — the data center building boom is backed by the richest companies and most powerful government in the world. If they need more electricity to remain dominant in A.I. (and protect their market capitalizations), they will find a way.

“The fertiliser industry is a key sector of German industry – and at the same time heavily dependent on fossil natural gas,” said SKN director Rainer Baake.
The abundance of renewable energy makes climate-friendly production significantly cheaper in other regions than in Germany.
For example, procurement costs for green ammonia of approximately 693 euros per tonne are expected in Namibia by 2035, compared to some 1,130 euros in Germany.
The report examined three value chain options for green ammonia: production entirely located in Germany, a route using hydrogen imports from Spain, and a route using ammonia imports from Namibia, which is then processed in Germany.","The production of fertilisers with fossil fuels has no future in Germany given the country's climate targets, according to a report by the German Energy Agency (Dena) in cooperation with the Climate Neutrality Foundation (SKN), which outlines a roadmap for the transition to using green ammonia instead.

However, the relocation of a large portion of the industry abroad is unavoidable in the long term because renewable electricity will remain more expensive in Germany compared to sunnier or windier regions such as Spain or Namibia, according to the report.

Ammonia is a key ingredient in fertilisers and traditionally made with fossil gas. Green ammonia is made on the basis of green hydrogen, which is produced with electrolysis using renewable electricity.

Green fertiliser production should nevertheless be established domestically and maintained through policy measures to reduce geopolitical risks and secure supply, the authors argued.

“The fertiliser industry is a key sector of German industry – and at the same time heavily dependent on fossil natural gas,” said SKN director Rainer Baake. “Anyone who wants to keep this industry in Germany must restructure it so that it can operate without fossil fuels by the mid-2040s at the latest.”

In view of Germany’s 2045 climate neutrality target and the expiration of free emission allowances for the fertiliser industry under the European Emissions Trading System (ETS) by 2039, the report argues that new supply chains must be established for imports from sunny and wind-rich countries to facilitate the transition.

The abundance of renewable energy makes climate-friendly production significantly cheaper in other regions than in Germany. For example, procurement costs for green ammonia of approximately 693 euros per tonne are expected in Namibia by 2035, compared to some 1,130 euros in Germany.

The report examined three value chain options for green ammonia: production entirely located in Germany, a route using hydrogen imports from Spain, and a route using ammonia imports from Namibia, which is then processed in Germany. It found the third scenario to be the most cost-effective.

Minister for the State Electricity Commission Lily D’Ambrosio visited the site today to see the installation of a 162.5 tonne transformer that will connect the park to the grid and help drive down energy prices for families.

The project’s 212,296 solar panels and a 100-megawatt, two-hour battery system will have enough to power more than 51,000 homes each year. It will be among Australia’s first integrated solar and battery energy storage systems (BESS) connected through a single grid connection point.

The new battery provides additional energy capacity to the grid, enabling 180-megawatts of new renewable generation to be connected to the grid, further pushing energy prices down.

This is Victoria’s first 100 per cent government-owned energy generator since the Jeff Kennett’s Liberal Party sold the state’s energy system to private companies that sent much of the profits offshore.

Work will continue into next year, ahead of the project becoming operational in 2027. More than 200 people have been employed on the site to date, including local tradespeople from the community and surrounding areas.

The project is also giving apprentices and trainees valuable hands-on experience in Victoria’s growing renewable energy sector – creating local jobs and building skills that will benefit the community.

SEC and its construction partners OX2 and PSD continue to engage with local jobseekers for upcoming roles as work progresses.

SEC is working with the Horsham community to shape a Community Benefit Fund, ensuring the project delivers long-term value for the region and the fund will be launched next year.

SEC recently announced plans to increase the fund to $100,000 a year and will now invest $3 million in local projects, initiatives and services over the 30-year operational life of the project.

If finalized, the plant would be built with an initial annual capacity of around 2 GWh, focusing on utility-level and commercial and industrial (C&I) battery energy storage systems.
NeoVolta CEO Ardes Johnson said the investment arrives at a pivotal moment for the company’s U.S. manufacturing strategy.
“IGC is well-capitalized and highly aligned with our vision as we advance our domestic manufacturing plans and scale our commercial and grid-aligned channels,” Johnson said.
“IGC is proud to back NeoVolta’s U.S. manufacturing initiative,” said Frank Liu, the firm’s general partner and CEO.","NeoVolta has secured $13m in private placement financing to advance its domestic manufacturing ambitions, marking a significant step in the company’s push to scale U.S.-made battery energy storage systems.

The financing round is anchored by Infinite Grid Capital (IGC), which has committed $10m as part of a long-term strategic relationship aimed at accelerating NeoVolta’s next phase of growth.

The funding is designed to support NeoVolta’s planned entry into large-scale U.S. production. A substantial portion of the capital is earmarked for a proposed state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Georgia, outlined in a memorandum of understanding with third-party partners. If finalized, the plant would be built with an initial annual capacity of around 2 GWh, focusing on utility-level and commercial and industrial (C&I) battery energy storage systems. The company expects operations could begin ramping up in 2026, pending definitive agreements.

The initiative would position NeoVolta to benefit from federal incentives encouraging domestic battery production and supply-chain resilience — a priority for both U.S. energy policy and companies seeking to reduce dependence on imported storage technologies. The expansion would also strengthen the country’s industrial base by adding new manufacturing capabilities in a sector seeing rapid demand growth due to grid modernization, electrification, and extreme-weather resilience needs.

NeoVolta CEO Ardes Johnson said the investment arrives at a pivotal moment for the company’s U.S. manufacturing strategy. “IGC is well-capitalized and highly aligned with our vision as we advance our domestic manufacturing plans and scale our commercial and grid-aligned channels,” Johnson said. “The investment delivers the capital and support we need while preserving the flexibility essential to our next phase of growth.”

IGC leaders framed the deal as a commitment to strengthening American clean-energy manufacturing. “IGC is proud to back NeoVolta’s U.S. manufacturing initiative,” said Frank Liu, the firm’s general partner and CEO. “This partnership reflects our commitment to advancing domestic energy storage capabilities and enabling the next phase of scalable growth.”

Beyond manufacturing, the two companies intend to collaborate on future commercial opportunities, including potential offtake agreements that could align NeoVolta’s products with IGC’s grid-scale portfolio.

While the memorandum of understanding remains non-binding, both parties say they are committed to pursuing the strategic initiative and will provide updates as the project advances. If realized, the Georgia facility would represent a meaningful expansion of U.S. battery-storage production at a time when domestic capacity is considered critical for energy security, economic competitiveness, and the growth of American clean-tech manufacturing.",http://themanufacturer-cdn-1.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/27094836/NeoVolta2.jpg,N,,2025-11-27 08:58:58.823380

Recycling will increasingly play a key role, and Redwood Materials already controls roughly 90% of lithium-ion battery recycling in North America—the equivalent of 250,000 EV batteries per year.
Still, that 90% equals only about 10% of the EV battery deployment in the U.S. each year.
“The end goal is creating a circular economy where recycling—not mining—becomes the primary source of the minerals,” Straubel said.","Tesla cofounder JB Straubel served as the brains behind the battery development for the electric vehicle giant, and he saw firsthand the massive amounts of critical minerals that are potentially wasted when it comes time to retire each EV—raw materials ripe for recycling and redeploying.

China dominates most of the world’s critical mineral supply chains. Each EV battery represents a treasure trove of lithium, cobalt, copper, nickel, and more that can be reused for brand-new batteries for energy storage and all sorts of devices from AI data centers to military equipment to smartphones and computers. There are 60 natural elements deemed “critical minerals” by the U.S. government, and America only produces a small minority of them.

Straubel founded Redwood Materials in 2017, which is rapidly expanding and has grown into the United States’ first line of defense for recycling critical minerals in the potential supply-chain cold war with China—now at a temporary truce.

“Being able to tap into materials that are already in the market can dramatically reduce the pressure on what’s needed to mine,” Straubel told Fortune. “Once you have some diversity of supply, you reduce the risk of the [Chinese] monopoly and the geopolitical concentration.”

Since the U.S. launched a tariff war earlier this year and China threatened to withhold certain critical minerals, the U.S. has aggressively emphasized investments and partnerships for developing its own critical minerals mining, refining, recycling, and magnet and battery manufacturing. China currently accounts for over 80% of the global production of battery materials.

The U.S. can’t just open a dozen new mines overnight. Recycling will increasingly play a key role, and Redwood Materials already controls roughly 90% of lithium-ion battery recycling in North America—the equivalent of 250,000 EV batteries per year. Still, that 90% equals only about 10% of the EV battery deployment in the U.S. each year. That means Redwood could expand its capacity by 10 times even if the EV market share stays flat in the U.S.

Straubel refers to Redwood’s facilities as “urban mines.” Redwood leads its battery recycling from its Nevada campus and now has a brand-new, $3.5 billion, 600-acre plant in South Carolina. Nvidia recently came on as a strategic investor.

A major reason is oil prices, said Andrew Leach, who teaches economics and law at the University of Alberta.
For years, growth was underpinned by visions of “$100 oil, $200 oil, $300 oil,” but those days are gone, Leach said.
It was sold for more than $45 US less per barrel compared to the main U.S. oil price.
But there’s a much bigger challenge at hand given falling oil prices, he said.","A long-awaited deal is set to be unveiled Thursday that reportedly will include support for a new oil pipeline to the B.C. coast, as well as exemptions for Alberta from federal environmental laws.

Those moves will likely be received with open arms amongst industry leaders in the oil and gas sector. The argument has often been made that uncertainty over regulations, paired with challenges in getting products to market, is chasing away new investment.

But even if this agreement reduces some of that friction, experts say it won’t necessarily trigger a sudden flood in spending.

A major reason is oil prices, said Andrew Leach, who teaches economics and law at the University of Alberta.

The benchmark North American crude blend known as West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, is currently priced below $60 US, and the U.S. Energy Information Administration projects prices will decline to an average of $55 US in 2026. Projections vary, but others see prices headed even lower in 2027.

“If that’s the environment we’re headed to … all you have to look at is the operating costs and operating profits of these facilities,” Leach said. “You’ll get a sense that that’s going to disrupt things at a scale no federal policy exemption could correct.”

In 2014, oil and gas investment in Canada ranged around $80 billion.

In 2025, it’s closer to approximately $35 billion, according to the latest numbers from the ARC Energy Research Institute, which models the entire Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin.

For years, growth was underpinned by visions of “$100 oil, $200 oil, $300 oil,” but those days are gone, Leach said.

“The world is awash in cheap energy, which has a whole bunch of positives,” he said. “But when you’re sitting on a trillion barrels of oil, the fact that the world’s awash in cheap energy is generally bad news.”

On market access

Alberta’s oilsands hit a record production high in 2025 as companies invested in smaller expansions.

But the last major oilsands facility was Suncor’s Fort Hills mine, which opened in 2018. Even with a new pipeline, building a new oilsands facility would require a massive investment to the tune of billions of dollars.

Leach said he doesn’t see that happening, unless there’s a massive rebound in long-term price expectations.

Richard Masson, an executive fellow at the University of Calgary's School of Public Policy and the former CEO of the Alberta Petroleum Marketing Commission, agreed there’s unlikely to be a new mine from a new operator.

“The existing players have all the best leases and have economies of scale and experience, so will focus on mine pit replacements and incremental expansions,” he said.

Masson said companies have started to invest more in growth, with Canadian Natural Resources , Suncor and Cenovus among those pursuing projects.

But in his view, the big barrier to more of that happening has been market access.

“We had grown production really quickly, and then we didn’t have enough pipelines, and then the differential widened a lot,” he said, referring to the price gap between WTI and the Canadian price of oil, Western Canada Select.

“Companies said, 'I’m not going to spend hundreds of millions or billions of dollars, if I can’t get my product to market at a good price.' And so growth really slowed down.”

Masson said he thinks it's necessary to amend the federal regulations to provide more clarity. Once that happens, growth can speed up to the extent that market access is available.

But he stressed that a new pipeline isn’t a simple proposition.

Canada has embarked on a variety of pipeline misadventures over the past decade, including Keystone XL, which had a winding history of approvals and rejections.

Carney raised Keystone XL pipeline revival in meeting with Trump

“We messed up so many things on building pipelines in the last decade. It’s going to be super difficult to overcome,” he said. “How are we going to do that? And who’s going to take the lead?”

Who wants to build a pipeline?

Analysts say it’s often overlooked whether pipeline companies themselves want to take on a megaproject.

Aaron MacNeil, a research analyst with TD Cowen, said the industry is still grappling with the fallout of recent megaprojects that ran far over budget.

“We have two clearly documented examples of projects that have recently been completed and were significantly above initial budget expectations,” he said, referring to Coastal GasLink and the Trans Mountain expansion project.

Today’s midstream companies have plenty of short-cycle, low-risk, high-return options to invest in, MacNeil said.

They also have constraints, including limited capital and limited teams. That makes them less inclined to pursue a pipeline project when other opportunities deliver better and faster returns, he said.

MacNeil classifies a new West Coast pipeline as a “blue sky” scenario: possible, but low-probability without incentives. To make it viable, he said it could potentially include a government backstop if costs soared for reasons beyond the company's control.

What's next?

A TD Cowen report released Nov. 11 suggests there’s currently a “major point of debate” amongst investors and the industry centred around when the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin might again face constraints on the amount of crude oil that can be transported, otherwise known as takeaway capacity.

The investment bank pointed out that in 2018, when there wasn't enough capacity to transport oil out of the region, the price for Canadian heavy crude oil dropped significantly.

It was sold for more than $45 US less per barrel compared to the main U.S. oil price. Such sharp drops can cause major financial harm to oil producers, and results in major impacts to government budgets.

""I think that we have very good visibility to brownfield expansions in the near- and medium-term, which will bring on market access in a just-in-time manner,"" MacNeil said. ""Obviously, longer term, we don't have as clear visibility on that.""

Leach said he won't dispute that some federal policies were going to change the viability of resource investment.

Those policies could have imposed costs on projects and uncertainty into the regulatory process, he said.

But there’s a much bigger challenge at hand given falling oil prices, he said.

“Now, we’re in this world where suddenly we’re going to ignore all these price changes, and say it’s just the federal policies that matter,” he said. “I think that’s the wrong approach.”","https://i.cbc.ca/ais/02083ac2-f5b5-40e8-8b8c-9b72c6ad1870,1764191051290/full/max/0/default.jpg?im=Crop%2Crect%3D%280%2C139%2C4000%2C2250%29%3BResize%3D620",N,,2025-11-27 09:58:29.550725

Data centres need a lot of electricity and emit lot of excess heat that should be utilised.

Finland wants to retain control

Veli-Matti Mattila, former CEO of the software firm Elisa, wants to see cuts to electricity taxes and a softening of permission rules for data centres. But he is also calling for the centres to be required to register their activities, so that “we know what they are doing.”

Read the article in Swedish on Arbeidsliv i Norden

TikTok’s plans for a centre in Kouvola have created debate, but Mattila underlines that it is better that tech giants like TikTok set up shop in Finland rather than outside of the EU.

There are some 30 data centres in Finland right now, but the number could multiply within a few years as AI, cloud services and digitalisation continue to grow.

Necessary boost outside growth areas

The data centres bring a welcome boost to the Finnish economy. They also support digitalisation and the development of the data economy, as well as supply security, pointed out Finnish Prime Minister Petter Orpo in a comment to the roadmap.

Finland is particularly looking for investments that create added economic value through increased employment, tax income and innovation. New server halls are not enough.

The data centres also contribute to business activity outside of the main growth areas and can help boost the regional economy and research.

Wahlroos: Good climate for cooling

Cooling is an important issue for data centres, which is why many companies build them in cool places.

Finnish banker Björn Wahlroos recently told Finnish TV about the challenges of getting people to invest in the country.

“Finland is in the far north of Europe, at the end of the line, with a climate that is only good for one thing: cooling data centres.”

Otherwise, Finland is not that attractive, especially not when it comes to taxation. High tax levels are not very tempting for workers or investors, according to Björn Wahlroos.

He moved to Sweden in protest against Finland’s inheritance tax, but in the TV interview, he said he was more comfortable with a Mediterranean climate.

Lower taxes and a lot of cheap energy

Wahlroos, and many with him, underline the need for attracting investments. Data centres can benefit the national economy if investors can be tempted with good financial incentives, well-educated workers and tax reliefs.

But they also want cheap, reliable energy, since data centres consume a great deal of power and release a lot of excess heat that needs to be cooled down, preferably in a productive way.

In the USA, data centres’ energy needs have come in for a lot of criticism. They put pressure on the electricity grid and can push up energy costs.

Large American companies are planning to build their own power plants to secure their energy supply. Such plans also exist in Finland, albeit on a smaller scale.

The government: Avoid weather dependency and Russian energy

When Petteri Orpo’s government came to power in 2022, it promised more new electricity production capacity than ever before. The industry would benefit from increased investments, and fossil fuels would be replaced with electricity-based solutions in industry, heating and transport.

The government wants to promote the green transition with cleantech solutions with stable and predictable framework conditions. Data centre projects will be encouraged; they should be able to link to the grid, and their excess heat should be used for district heating.

More nuclear power

The government argues that Finland needs more nuclear power and has promised to approve all applications for a decision-in-principle that meet the criteria, where the applicant’s background is considered acceptable in terms of national security.

The construction of small modular reactors (SMRs) will be facilitated. New nuclear energy legislation will pave the way for innovation and a faster execution of projects.

The Hanhikivi nuclear power plant, south of Oulu, is still fresh in people’s minds.

The nuclear power company Fennovoima had already begun forest clearing and groundwork for a new power plant with technology, fuel and participation from Russian Rosatom.

This ended when Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

Instead, Finland began freeing itself from Russian energy dependence. The legal aftermath is still ongoing.

Small-scale nuclear power plant in the middle of Helsinki?

But the nuclear power debate is yet again raging. Helsinki’s energy company Helen is looking into positioning small-scale nuclear energy production in the middle of the Finnish capital,

The aim is stable, fossil-free electricity production in a small-scale, safe nuclear power plant, independent of the weather, with no carbon emissions and in a cost-effective way.

A public meeting to discuss nuclear power in November heard many express concerns about security risks. The meeting was not about the principle of nuclear power, but it gave residents the chance to seek more information now that the environmental impact assessment is beginning.

The participants were not convinced, but they remained calm. The oldest remembered earlier campaigns urging people to save energy, and several expressed concern for the long-term safety risks of placing nuclear power in the middle of Helsinki.

Helsinki city councillors will make a decision in the coming years. But small-scale nuclear power production is already part of the capital’s strategy.

Kajaani – excess heat as a resource

Helsinki is not alone in looking at nuclear power as an option. The same is happening in Kuopio and some other places.

Other types of energy use are also being explored. The vocational high school in Kajaani has spent the past two years working with companies and the Finnish Natural Resources Institute Luke to create a project aimed at reusing excess heat from by data centres.

The aim is to build several functioning facilities in addition to those already located in the Renforsin shore area, which used to house wood processing and paper industry operations.

There, the Icelandic company Borealis Data Center is expanding its capacity beyond the facility it purchased in February 2024.

In a press release, the company underlines its desire to use AI on a large scale. It also mentions the infrastructure that makes environmentally friendly data centre activity possible.

Kajaani already hosts some of Europe’s supercomputers and could become a hub for data centres.

Just outside Kajaani city centre, in Otanmäki, Google is preparing to establish a sizeable presence. For the city, this means large visions including heated pavements, greenhouses, fish farming and water purification.

Project manager Sirpa Keränen underlines that these are high-level dreams, but they are technically achievable. She also mentions the outdoor pools, which will stay open for more than the three summer months.

Excess heat from the data halls could heat the pool water all winter – an unbeatable attraction for the tourism industry in Northern Finland, she argues.

At these latitudes, the sun is out only for a few hours in winter, and temperatures often fall below zero.

A Nordic perspective

When Nordic energy ministers met in October, they highlighted the need to expand transmission grids and speed up energy production.

The Nordic region is already in a strong position thanks to renewable energy, stable electricity prices and high levels of technological expertise.

But the ministers stressed that the region could become a world leader on energy security and the green transition – even in the Arctic areas.",https://www.nordiclabourjournal.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Helsinki-tram.jpg,N,,2025-11-27 15:01:14.177580

Global critical minerals markets face unprecedented disruption as traditional supply chains encounter mounting geopolitical pressures and demand volatility. The convergence of energy transition requirements, democratic alliance building, and resource security imperatives creates new frameworks for international cooperation that extend far beyond conventional trade relationships.

Australia and EU critical minerals cooperation represents a fundamental shift in how democratic nations approach strategic resource partnerships. Rather than pursuing purely transactional commodity exchanges, this collaboration establishes integrated development mechanisms that align geological advantages with processing capabilities, financial resources, and end-use manufacturing requirements. Furthermore, this partnership addresses the mining industry evolution taking place globally.

Regulatory Architecture Driving Cooperation

The European Union's Critical Raw Materials Act (CRMA) establishes binding targets that create structural demand for international partnerships: 10% domestic extraction, 40% processing capacity, and 25% recycling rates by 2030. These targets acknowledge that EU domestic resources alone cannot satisfy critical minerals requirements for energy transition and digital transformation initiatives.

Australia's mining regulatory environment demonstrates compatibility with EU environmental, social, and governance standards through several key mechanisms. The establishment of a proposed European CRM facility further reinforces these alignment efforts.

Environmental impact assessment protocols aligned with EU Environmental Impact Assessment Directive 2014/52/EU

Social governance frameworks compatible with OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises

Supply chain transparency requirements under the EU Conflict Minerals Regulation (2017/821)

Rehabilitation and closure standards matching EU environmental restoration obligations

This regulatory alignment eliminates administrative friction that typically complicates international resource partnerships. Projects developed under Australian mining law can meet EU sustainability requirements without dual compliance systems, reducing operational complexity and development costs.

The 34 critical raw materials identified under the CRMA span lithium for battery production, rare earth elements for renewable energy systems, cobalt for electric vehicle batteries, and graphite for energy storage applications. Australia possesses established production capacity or development projects across the majority of these priority materials.

Financial Innovation Through EIB Global Partnership

The Declaration of Intent signed in November 2025 between EIB Global and the Australian Government creates structured financing mechanisms that address fundamental challenges in critical minerals project development. Traditional mining finance struggles with long development timelines, substantial capital requirements, and uncertain demand profiles that characterize emerging critical minerals markets.

EIB Global financing mechanisms established through the Declaration include:

Investment Mechanism Function Strategic Advantage Direct equity participation Risk sharing across project phases Reduced capital requirements for Australian developers Long-term supply contracts Price stability and demand certainty Guaranteed market access for Australian producers Technology transfer partnerships Advanced processing capabilities Value-added mineral products and innovation exchange Infrastructure co-investment Shared development costs Accelerated project timelines and reduced individual exposure

This framework enables risk mitigation for critical minerals projects across the entire value chain from exploration through processing and recycling operations. EIB approved €60 billion in financing for climate action and environment projects in 2023, demonstrating substantial lending capacity for critical minerals development initiatives.

Direct equity participation allows EIB Global to take ownership stakes in Australian critical minerals projects, reducing capital burden on local developers while aligning financial returns with project success. Long-term supply contracts create 10-15 year demand certainty that facilitates project financing viability through guaranteed off-take agreements.

Geopolitical Drivers and Strategic Positioning

Democratic nations increasingly recognise critical minerals supply chains as national security infrastructure requiring alliance-based solutions. China controls approximately 60-70% of global rare earth element processing capacity, creating strategic vulnerabilities that extend beyond economic considerations into defence and technology sovereignty.

Chinese export restrictions implemented since 2010 demonstrate how resource concentration enables political leverage over importing nations. According to the Australian Government's strategic minerals partnership, China's export quotas on rare earth elements remain volatile and subject to geopolitical tensions, creating supply uncertainty for manufacturers dependent on these materials for advanced technologies.

Alliance Structures for Resource Security

Australia and EU critical minerals cooperation represents deliberate diversification away from authoritarian-controlled supply chains toward partnerships among democratic allies. This approach addresses multiple strategic objectives whilst supporting energy transition mining initiatives globally.

Supply chain resilience through geographic and political diversification

Environmental standards alignment reducing regulatory arbitrage risks

Technology transfer opportunities enhancing processing capabilities

Defence cooperation integration supporting broader security partnerships

Global critical minerals demand growth of 40-60% by 2040 due to energy transition creates market opportunities for alternative suppliers. Democratic nations possess geological resources, technological capabilities, and financial resources necessary to develop parallel supply chains independent of authoritarian control.

The EU imports approximately 98% of its rare earth element requirements, creating strategic vulnerability that extends across renewable energy, electric vehicles, defence systems, and telecommunications infrastructure. Australia's geological endowments in rare earths, lithium, cobalt, and other critical minerals position it as a natural partner for EU supply diversification.

Strategic Autonomy Framework Implementation

The EU's strategic autonomy agenda prioritises partnerships with politically stable, democratically governed nations possessing advanced mining infrastructure. Australia represents an optimal strategic partner through established geological resources, mature regulatory frameworks, democratic governance alignment, and geographic distance from geopolitical instability zones.

EU Strategic Compass and Industrial Strategy for Net-Zero Europe guides partnership selection criteria emphasising:

Domestic extraction initiatives targeting increased EU mining and processing capacity

Partner diversification developing multiple democratic supply sources

Circular economy integration advancing recycling and secondary material recovery

Technology advancement supporting innovation in processing technologies

The €1 trillion EU Green Deal investment target by 2030 creates substantial financing capacity for critical minerals partnerships. EU requirements for a 25-fold increase in lithium processing by 2030 to meet battery production targets demonstrate the scale of partnership opportunities. Additionally, Australia's strategic reserve initiatives complement these European objectives.

Economic Integration and Investment Mechanisms

Australia-EU bilateral trade volumes reached €49 billion in goods and €38 billion in services in 2025, establishing substantial economic integration that provides foundation for expanded critical minerals cooperation. Spanish companies expanding presence in Australia's energy, defence, and transport sectors indicate broader European industrial integration beyond minerals alone.

Joint project development mechanisms accelerate market entry by distributing financial requirements across multiple parties while creating demand certainty through long-term contracts. This shared risk approach enables smaller and mid-tier Australian mining companies to advance projects that would otherwise remain underfunded.

Technology Transfer and Value Addition

Technology transfer partnerships provide Australian producers access to EU advanced processing techniques, enabling value-added mineral production rather than raw ore exports. Processing efficiency improvements of 5-15% from technology transfer enhance project economics while supporting EU manufacturing competitiveness. These advances contribute significantly to the lithium battery revolution occurring globally.

Critical minerals cooperation facilitates integration across multiple industry sectors:

Defence manufacturing: Secure cobalt and rare earth supplies for radar systems and communications equipment

Battery production: Lithium supply security supporting EU electric vehicle manufacturing

Telecommunications infrastructure: Rare earth elements essential for 5G networks and advanced communications

Renewable energy systems: Critical minerals for wind turbines, solar panels, and energy storage

European defence expenditure increased approximately 21% in 2023 compared to 2022, reaching €230 billion and creating substantial demand for defence-grade critical minerals. Secure supply chains for these materials become essential for European defence industrial base resilience.

Infrastructure Development and Co-Investment

Critical minerals projects require substantial infrastructure investment in processing facilities, transportation networks, and port capabilities. Capital requirements range from €200 million to €2+ billion depending on commodity and scale, creating financing barriers for individual developers.

EU co-investment in Australian infrastructure reduces individual project risk while ensuring supply chain integration meets European manufacturing specifications. Joint infrastructure development includes:

Processing facilities incorporating EU technology standards

Transportation networks connecting mines to processing and export facilities

Port infrastructure enabling efficient product shipping to European markets

Research and development facilities supporting ongoing technology advancement

Regulatory Compliance and Standards Alignment

Australia's mining environmental standards demonstrate operational compatibility with EU sustainability requirements, eliminating regulatory friction that complicates international partnerships. Both jurisdictions mandate comprehensive environmental impact assessments, ongoing monitoring requirements, restoration obligations, and stakeholder engagement protocols.

Environmental Framework Harmonisation

Environmental standard compatibility encompasses multiple regulatory areas:

Water management: Comparable requirements for quality monitoring and protection

Biodiversity conservation: Aligned habitat protection and species preservation protocols

Air quality standards: Similar emission limits and monitoring requirements

Waste management: Compatible standards for tailings storage and processing waste

Closure and rehabilitation: Mandatory environmental restoration at project end-of-life

This regulatory alignment reduces compliance costs for joint ventures operating across both jurisdictions while ensuring environmental performance meets shared democratic values and international standards.

Certification and Market Access Systems

The European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) for Raw Materials coordinates certification and best practice exchange between Australian and EU mining operations. EIT RawMaterials includes 70+ partners across 26 countries, providing established networks for knowledge transfer and standard harmonisation.

Certification processes ensure Australian critical minerals meet EU processing and end-use specifications:

Sustainable sourcing verification confirming environmental and social compliance

Processing specifications matching EU manufacturing requirements

Supply chain traceability enabling end-to-end tracking from mine to end-user

Recycling integration supporting EU circular economy targets

These certification frameworks enable market access to premium-priced EU supply chains prioritising environmental and social criteria while providing competitive advantages for certified Australian producers.

Market Impact and Competitive Positioning

Australia and EU critical minerals cooperation creates alternative supply sources that reduce Chinese market influence over pricing and availability. Long-term supply contracts between Australian producers and EU manufacturers establish price stability mechanisms benefiting both resource developers and end-use industries.

Priority Minerals and Strategic Focus

""Critical Focus Areas"": Lithium extraction and processing for battery manufacturing, rare earth element separation for renewable energy systems, cobalt production for electric vehicle batteries, and graphite processing for energy storage applications represent priority commodities driving partnership initiatives.

Lithium processing facilities requiring €500 million+ capital investment can now access EIB co-financing, reducing individual project risk exposure while accelerating development timelines. Long-term battery raw material contracts with EU manufacturers create demand certainty extending 10-15 years beyond initial production commencement.

Chinese processing dominance in rare earth elements creates opportunities for alternative suppliers meeting democratic governance and environmental standards. Australian rare earth projects supported by EU investment and technology can capture market share from producers dependent on Chinese processing capabilities.

Pricing Dynamics and Market Restructuring

Increased Australian production capacity supported by EU investment creates competitive alternatives to Chinese-dominated supply chains. Typical critical minerals project development timelines of 5-10 years mean partnership benefits will materialise progressively through the 2030s as projects advance through development phases.

Market restructuring occurs through multiple mechanisms:

Supply diversification reducing single-source dependencies

Long-term contracting creating price stability for producers and consumers

Processing competition challenging Chinese technological advantages

Democratic alliance sourcing premium pricing for secure supply chains

Implementation Challenges and Risk Factors

The stalled Australia-EU Free Trade Agreement presents ongoing challenges, with disagreements over agricultural market access and EU protection of geographic indications creating broader trade relationship complications. These unresolved issues could impact critical minerals cooperation timelines and investment flows.

Infrastructure and Development Requirements

Australian critical minerals projects require significant infrastructure investment that extends beyond individual mine sites to encompass:

Regional processing hubs serving multiple mining operations

Skilled workforce development for advanced processing technologies

Research and development capabilities maintaining technological competitiveness

Transportation networks connecting remote deposits to processing and export facilities

Port expansion accommodating increased critical minerals export volumes

EU co-investment in infrastructure reduces individual project risk while ensuring supply chain integration meets European manufacturing specifications. However, coordination between multiple stakeholders across two continents creates project management complexity requiring institutional frameworks for dispute resolution and performance monitoring.

Regulatory and Political Risk Management

Long-term critical minerals partnerships face potential disruption from:

Regulatory changes affecting mining approvals or environmental requirements

Political transitions altering government support for international partnerships

Trade policy shifts impacting tariffs or import regulations

Currency fluctuations affecting project economics and return calculations

Technology disruption changing mineral requirements or processing methods

Risk mitigation requires robust contractual frameworks, political risk insurance, and flexibility mechanisms accommodating changing circumstances over 15-20 year project lifecycles.

Future Implications and Strategic Outcomes

Australia and EU critical minerals cooperation establishes a template for democratic resource partnerships that could extend to other allied nations including Canada, the United States, and Japan. This alliance structure has potential to fundamentally reshape global critical minerals markets by reducing authoritarian control over strategic resources.

Long-term Market Transformation

Democratic resource cooperation creates several transformative effects:

Supply chain resilience through geographic and political diversification

Technology advancement via collaborative research and development

Environmental standards elevation across global mining operations

Market competition reducing monopolistic pricing power

Strategic autonomy for democratic nations in critical technologies

Partnership expansion potential includes integration with existing initiatives such as the Minerals Security Partnership, QUAD critical minerals cooperation, and AUKUS technology sharing agreements. Institutional frameworks developed for Australia-EU cooperation provide models for broader alliance-based resource development.

Energy Transition Acceleration

Secure, democratically sourced critical minerals supplies enable accelerated renewable energy deployment and electric vehicle adoption across EU markets. Australian resource capacity supported by European investment and technology creates supply chain resilience essential for achieving climate transition objectives without geopolitical vulnerability.

Climate transition timelines depend critically on materials availability, with lithium, cobalt, and rare earth shortages potentially constraining deployment rates for renewable energy and electric transportation. Australia and EU critical minerals cooperation directly addresses these potential bottlenecks through coordinated capacity development.

Battery manufacturing competitiveness in European markets requires secure raw material supplies at predictable prices. Long-term contracts with Australian producers provide cost certainty enabling European manufacturers to compete globally while maintaining supply chain security aligned with democratic values.

Regulatory Framework Evolution

Both Australian and EU regulatory frameworks continue evolving to accommodate increased cooperation, with streamlined approval processes for joint ventures and harmonised environmental standards reducing administrative complexity. Policy adaptations create institutional foundations for expanded partnership scope beyond current critical minerals focus areas.

Policy Innovation and Adaptation

Regulatory evolution encompasses:

Fast-track approval processes for projects meeting strategic partnership criteria

Environmental equivalency recognition reducing dual compliance requirements

Technology transfer facilitation through intellectual property frameworks

Investment protection mechanisms for long-term international partnerships

Dispute resolution systems managing cross-jurisdictional conflicts

These policy adaptations require coordination between federal and state governments in Australia and among EU member states to ensure consistent implementation across jurisdictions. However, as highlighted in recent EU strategic projects announcements, progress continues advancing rapidly.

Defence and Security Integration

Australia-EU negotiations on cyber-defence, procurement, and joint research and development reflect broader security cooperation that reinforces critical minerals partnership strategic value. Resource security increasingly integrates with defence policy as nations recognise supply chain vulnerabilities represent national security risks requiring allied coordination.

Defence industrial base resilience depends on secure access to critical minerals for advanced weapons systems, communications equipment, and electronic warfare capabilities. Australia and EU critical minerals cooperation supports broader defence partnership objectives while creating economic benefits for both regions.

Technology sovereignty considerations drive partnerships in critical minerals processing, battery manufacturing, and advanced materials development. Joint research initiatives enable shared technological advancement while maintaining competitive advantages over authoritarian competitors.

The design calls for 100 central inverters – four per transformer substation – across 25 substations delivering output at 34.5 kV. The generated energy will be routed through a low-voltage network to inverters that convert DC to AC at 645 V.

Another project is the 118.8 MW Tulancingo Solar Park, under development by Desarrollos Fotovoltaicos de México del Centro, expected to be located in the municipality of Singuilucan in the state of Hidalgo.

Moreover, Bluemex San Miguel submitted an environmental impact statement to the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (Semarnat) for the 139 MW FV Santa Fe solar project, which includes 680 W bifacial modules, an energy storage system, an electrical substation and a 335,885-meter transmission line on a surface of 481,432 hectares with a planned occupation of 178,781 hectares in the municipality of Allende, Guanajuato.

Another project is the 788.7 MW Alegría Solar project linked to 177.69 MW/314.98 MWh of battery storage. Submitted to Semarnat by Sunstone Power 2, the plant is planned for the municipality of Campeche in the homonymous state. It includes 1,151,416 photovoltaic modules of 685 W each, 101 transformer centers and 202 inverters.

Yet, GCC Solar Samalayuca requested the environmental impact statement for the Samalayuca I Solar Park project, which includes site preparation, construction and operation of a self-consumption photovoltaic park with an alternating-current generation capacity of up to 22.2 MW and an estimated production of 59,229 GWh per year. The facility will be located in Juárez in the state of Chihuahua.

In October, Spanish energy company Iberdrola announced plans to move ahead with two solar projects totaling 535 MW in Mexico, marking a renewed commitment to the country’s energy market after years of divestment and regulatory tensions.

Through its local subsidiary Green Park Energy, the Spanish utility obtained land-use change approval for a 415 MW photovoltaic plant in Saltillo, Coahuila. The unit also filed an environmental impact statement for its 120 MW San Diego de la Unión photovoltaic project in Guanajuato.

That dollar figure is eye-catching but also leads one to question: Why did it take an environmental disaster for officials to finally act against a business with an established track record of wiping its feet on regulations meant to curb pollution?

The answer: It’s in line with regulators’ kid-glove approach to environmental enforcement in Louisiana, where state and federal agencies go out of their way to provide a welcome mat for industry while placing the welfare of its residents on the backburner.

Examples of this practice are actually detailed in a lawsuit the state Department of Environmental Quality and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency have filed against Smitty’s Supply. It accuses the company of violating the federal Clean Water Act, the Louisiana Water Control Law and Louisiana Water Pollution Control regulations, among other regulations.

Their complaint cites hundreds of infractions going back nearly five years, culminating with the Aug. 22 disaster at its Roseland facility. Millions of gallons of oil, lubricants and automotive fluids made their way into the nearby Tangipahoa River and flowed several miles downstream. A fire that took two weeks to fully extinguish created an oily soot that covered nearby homes, farms and businesses.

Before that, the company was cited for illegal wastewater discharges, failing to report pollution and seven separate chemical spills since 2021 that went beyond the facility’s property and contaminated public areas.

Between May 2022 and August 2025, Smitty’s Supply reported that it exceeded limits 230 times for the amount of organic material, fecal coliform, carbon and other pollutants it’s allowed to discharge in its wastewater.

These are incidents that Smitty’s Supply has reported to regulators. What’s gone unreported?

According to the lawsuit, the company failed to conduct “daily visual observations” of five outfall canals to check for possible pollutants on weekends and holidays from May 2022 through at least April 2025. A bit of quick math indicates that equals about 350 days without required surveillance. And because these inspections weren’t performed, they couldn’t be logged, which led to additional violations.

Then there are the infractions found when LDEQ inspectors made site visits. In January and February 2023, there were “hydrocarbon materials” and an orange “emulsified petroleum product” flowing from Smitty’s Supply outfall canals into a public roadside ditch.

After the August explosion, regulators determined the company failed to develop a required Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure Plan and didn’t adequately maintain a Facility Response Plan that lays out how it handles such incidents.

All this is to say there is an extensive history of the company failing to take significant steps to address its pattern of violations and minimal evidence of regulators taking meaningful enforcement action to bring about improvements.

The EPA’s website shows it has issued $161,522 in fines against Smitty’s Supply over the past five years, WVUE-TV Fox 8 reported in August. The company paid $250,000 to settle a state complaint over an oil spill in 2021, and the EPA collected $194,772 in 2019 for infractions, WWL-TV reported.

It’s hard to determine what kind of dent these penalties have made in the private company’s bottom line; it doesn’t have to make its revenue and net income public. But on its website, Smitty’s describes itself as “one of the leading manufacturers in the world of lubricants and related products.” It leads you to believe that Smitty’s Supply has had the wherewithal to prevent its many regulatory fumbles over the years, acknowledged and otherwise.

Like Charles Dickens wrote (and Elvis Costello later sang), accidents will happen. But they’re more probable — and maybe less likely to be considered accidents — in a state where officials aren’t willing to take meaningful punitive action to prevent them.

That leads to another question: It’s not if there will be another Smitty’s Supply-level disaster, but when and where.

Europe’s largest markets, Germany, the UK, France, Spain, and Italy, recorded a combined 32% increase in BEV sales in Q3 2025.
Spain’s BEV sales doubled compared to last year, with BEV market share now at 11%, benefiting from cheaper EV models and improving charging infrastructure.
The U.S. BEV market grew 22% in Q3 2025, reaching a 10% market share, driven largely by consumers rushing to benefit from federal tax credits before they expired.

In Q3 2025, total battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales rose 35% year-on-year, with more than one in five new vehicles sold globally being battery electric, according to PwC. National policies have been a major force behind this rise, while expanding model availability, more affordable options, and improved charging infrastructure have further strengthened consumer demand.

China stands out as the clearest example. Over two million BEVs were sold in Q3, giving the country a 34% market share. This growth is largely due to state-led incentives, including government subsidies for new energy vehicles (NEVs), exemptions from taxes, and restrictions on internal combustion engine (ICE) license plates encouraged first-time buyers to choose EVs.

These policies also made affordable, entry-level BEVs attractive, which contributed to a 6% year-on-year decline in PHEV sales as consumers increasingly skipped hybrids in favor of fully electric vehicles.

Europe Pushes Forward Through Regulation

Moving from China’s incentive-driven model to Europe’s rule-based structure shows how different policy approaches lead to different growth rates in EV adoption. Europe’s largest markets, Germany, the UK, France, Spain, and Italy, recorded a combined 32% increase in BEV sales in Q3 2025.

Germany led the pack, with a 45% year-on-year growth, reflecting a consistent domestic push with both incentives and strong EV model availability. The UK, while growing more moderately, has the highest BEV share among these top five countries at 23%, largely due to the ZEV Mandate, which requires 28% of new vehicles sold to be zero-emission.

Spain’s BEV sales doubled compared to last year, with BEV market share now at 11%, benefiting from cheaper EV models and improving charging infrastructure. Italy lagged at a 5% market share, reflecting slower adoption of new EV models and less aggressive government incentives. France saw moderate growth in BEV sales, rising 16% year on year, as consumers gradually shifted away from ICE vehicles in response to stricter emissions regulations and expanding EV incentives.

PHEVs in these markets grew 65% year-on-year, except in France, where they declined 8%, showing that hybrids still play a strategic role for automakers in meeting CO2 targets ahead of 2026 regulatory changes. Meanwhile, ICE vehicle registrations fell across all top-five markets, with France recording the sharpest drop at 27%, underlining the shift in consumer preference.

In smaller European markets, Denmark experienced a 43% year-on-year increase in BEVs, with a 70% market share of all new vehicles, second only to Norway at 97%. Sweden recorded the highest PHEV share at 27%, highlighting how policy, incentives, and infrastructure can shape adoption differently across countries.

The United States Leans on Affordability and Credits

The effect of policy becomes even more visible when looking at the United States. The U.S. BEV market grew 22% in Q3 2025, reaching a 10% market share, driven largely by consumers rushing to benefit from federal tax credits before they expired. This deadline produced a surge that automakers quickly responded to with more affordable line-ups.

GM and Hyundai, for example, grew their Q3 2025 EV sales more than sevenfold and over 100-fold, respectively, since 2015, as both introduced multiple new models under $50,000. VW’s EV sales nearly tripled over the same period. Surveys now show that nearly two-thirds of American consumers plan to buy an EV within five years, indicating that incentives can spark momentum that continues even after the policy ends.

Elsewhere in Asia, national policy continues to shape very different outcomes. South Korea’s 86% rise in BEV sales was fuelled by strong subsidies and the rapid expansion of charging stations, pushing its market share to 18%. Japan, however, remains dominated by hybrids. With BEVs and PHEVs making up just over 3% of new sales, the country’s slower policy shifts and long-standing consumer preference for hybrid technology have kept full electrification at bay.

When Policy Shapes Competition

Comparing these regions highlights a deeper pattern: national strategies are determining not just sales, but competitive advantage. China’s flexible, incentive-driven approach contrasts with Europe’s regulatory-heavy strategy.

Europe aims to ban ICE vehicles from 2035 and meet strict CO2 limits, but such top-down mandates can slow decision-making and consumer certainty. China instead uses subsidies, tax exemptions, and licensing policies to encourage adoption. Evidence from China’s rapidly rising BEV share shows that incentives can accelerate market growth more efficiently than strict bans alone.

In the US, policy uncertainty has led some automakers to scale back EV investment despite strong consumer demand. The Ford Mustang Mach-E recently outsold its petrol counterpart 2-1, showing that market appetite is growing regardless of temporary policy gaps. Manufacturers that fail to keep pace risk losing ground to rivals in Europe, China, and South Korea, where national policies are accelerating electrification with far greater consistency.

Does the Future Belong to Policy-Backed Innovation?

Even with incentives tapering off in some regions, the global direction of travel is clear. Falling battery costs, expanding model availability, and steady government commitments point to a future where EVs become the default choice.

The automakers that combine innovation with affordability, and operate in environments where national policy supports long-term investment, are best positioned to lead the next decade of mobility.

Spain, Europe's second-largest carmaker, is positioning itself as a battery hub thanks to lower labour costs and industrial energy prices that are about 20 per cent below the EU average. Three more plants are planned, including projects by Envision AESC, Volkswagen's PowerCo and InoBat.

Europe's auto associations are pushing for stricter requirements on local sourcing of components in part to protect them from Chinese rivals, as the European Commission prepares to unveil a new set of measures to bolster the sector.

But Spain lacks technical know-how for battery production, unions and auto industry representatives in Aragon told Reuters.

""We don't know this technology, these components - we've never made them before,"" said David Romeral, director general of CAAR Aragon, a network of automotive businesses in Aragon. ""They're years ahead of us. All we can do is watch and learn.""

Spain has fostered close trade relations with China even as Europe adopts a more hawkish stance, with a recent trip by its king and a group of ministers focused on strengthening economic ties.

At the ceremony in Figueruelas on Wednesday, Spain's industry and tourism minister, Jordi Hereu, said technology transfer was ""fundamental"" to the project. ""We need to learn from those who know,"" Hereu said, adding that Spain was ""open and ready to collaborate and build with all countries of the world, especially China.""

The plant in Figueruelas, a town of 1,300 people in northeastern Spain, is expected to begin production in late 2026, delivering batteries to Stellantis' car factories, including one located next door to the site.

Andy Wu, chief executive of the joint venture, declined to confirm reports of up to 2,000 workers being flown in from China for the construction phase, saying the firm was still selecting its subcontractors and was open to hiring locals.

It also planned to work with universities to train Spanish workers and bring some staff to its manufacturing base in China for additional training, Wu said.

The proportion of Chinese staff will eventually fall to under 10 per cent, a spokesperson added.

""Before, it was mostly German technology, and now it's Chinese. What difference does it make? Here in Spain, what we offered was always labour,"" said Roque Ordovas Mangiron, a Stellantis shipping manager.

You’re now seeing five-gigawatt campuses in Midland County, two-gigawatt gas-backed parks like Project Horizon, and 5-GW monsters like Pacifico’s Ranch.
The 2% of projects with budgets north of USD 17 billion somehow account for 42% of total capital deployment.
This is no longer about whether AI valuations are rich or whether project IRRs make sense on a spreadsheet.
The market is staring at an AI-capex universe that is forcibly rewriting America’s energy system in real time.","The AI trade has entered that deliciously dangerous phase where everyone keeps whispering about bubbles, but nobody is prepared to lift their foot off the accelerator. And the proof isn’t in NVIDIA’s (NASDAQ: ) price action anymore — it’s in the power grid. If you want to understand where the AI-capex Manhattan Project is heading, stop looking at GPUs and start looking at gigawatts.

As of mid-October, the US data-center pipeline has swollen to an absurd 245 GW, a number so grotesquely oversized it makes 2021-era crypto mining look like a candle flickering in a windstorm. The gravitational pull of that pipeline has shifted decisively toward Texas, where planned capacity has nearly doubled in two quarters as developers stampede into the only geography that can plausibly accommodate this scale of ambition.

The old gospel of “fibre adjacency” has been replaced by a blunt new commandment: access to power is access to survival. And once that truth took hold, the entire map of the industry began to warp. Data Center Alley is giving way to Data Center Prairie — sprawling, isolated, giga-campuses stretching across Pennsylvania steel country, the Wyoming emptiness, and above all, the sun-bleached plains of West and North Texas.

The developers aren’t pretending anymore. They don’t trust the utilities to deliver on time, and they aren’t willing to let grid bottlenecks dictate the pacing of the AI revolution. So they’re doing the unthinkable: building their own power plants, at hyperscaler scale and hyperscaler speed.

is the weapon of choice, particularly where the Permian Basin sits practically beneath the server racks. You’re now seeing five-gigawatt campuses in Midland County, two-gigawatt gas-backed parks like Project Horizon, and 5-GW monsters like Pacifico’s Ranch. And yet even the gas network is bursting at capacity, which means if you’re building far from the basin, you’re not just paying for more molecules — you’re paying in time, waiting for new pipelines that may not clear regulatory hurdles before the next economic cycle turns.

Some developers are bending sunlight and wind rather than gas, as in the Nevada and Utah solar-stabilized tract developments or Montana’s Big Sky digital infrastructure campus. But even there, batteries are less about flexibility and more about brute force balancing — smoothing renewables and providing fast-ramping backup for onsite gas turbines. These are no longer clever grid-optimization tricks. They’re survival systems designed for workloads that cannot go dark, ever.

And this all comes with a capital distortion that would make even late-cycle Silicon Valley blush. The 2% of projects with budgets north of USD 17 billion somehow account for 42% of total capital deployment. Meanwhile, the 60% of projects under USD 1 billion barely register — just 8% of total capex. Froth isn’t creeping into the system; it’s flooding the pipes.

The poster children are Project Jupiter in New Mexico at USD 160 billion and Project Kestrel in Missouri at USD 100 billion — numbers so detached from reality they feel like lunar base proposals. What’s more remarkable is the financial engineering underneath them: developers issuing industrial revenue bonds where they are both payer and payee, a circular structure that tees up tax advantages and pushes project valuations into uncharted airspace.

The biggest tell that we’ve entered a new regime is the hyperscalers themselves. For years, they resisted onsite generation, preferring the clean-hands simplicity of grid power. No scope 1 emissions, fewer headaches, shorter contractual lock-ins. But urgency is now trumping orthodoxy. Developers are betting that hyperscalers will overlook the operational risk because speed to compute is paramount, or that a new generation of hyperscalers — less fixated on ESG purity and more obsessed with capacity — will happily sign onto gas-fired campuses if it means teraflops tomorrow instead of teraflops in 2029.

Even though only 10% of the pipeline includes onsite generation, those projects account for a staggering 34% of total capacity. And of course, Texas dominates the map, with gas turbines as the workhorse technology. Every terawatt of this build-out tightens the natural-gas market, competing directly with LNG exports and nudging long-term gas prices higher.

This doesn’t just lift electricity bills for consumers — it crowds utilities out of the turbine market at precisely the moment on-grid demand from EVs, manufacturing reshoring, and electrification is accelerating. If the off-grid AI complexes soak up the turbine supply chain, the regulated utilities will be left trying to keep the lights on with one hand tied behind their back.

And here’s the real kicker: even if the AI bubble burps, pops, or deflates gently, the affordability and reliability pressures unleashed by this shift will not disappear. Once tens of gigawatts of private, gas-fired compute fortresses start pulling fuel, burning molecules, and shaping regional power curves, state regulators are going to step in. First softly, then loudly. And once that happens, all bets are off. Markets can price a bubble; they can’t price a political backlash against runaway energy demand.

This is no longer about whether AI valuations are rich or whether project IRRs make sense on a spreadsheet. The market is staring at an AI-capex universe that is forcibly rewriting America’s energy system in real time. The Manhattan Project metaphor is no longer figurative — it’s literal. The new bottleneck isn’t chips. It’s joules. And every hyperscaler knows it.",https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/redesign/images/seo/investingcom_analysis_og.jpg,N,,2025-11-27 05:58:44.607994

German energy group RWE announced the commissioning of the Stoneridge Solar project in Milam County, Texas. The facility includes a photovoltaic plant with a capacity of 200 megawatts (MW) and a battery storage system of 100 MW, or 200 megawatt-hours (MWh). This energy complex is designed to meet strong local demand while ensuring a stable contribution to the power grid.

A strategic project in a fast-growing market

Stoneridge Solar adds to RWE’s energy assets in the United States, where total capacity now exceeds 11 gigawatts (GW). The project strengthens the company’s position in the expanding American market, particularly in the southern region where electricity needs are driven by rapid population growth and extreme weather conditions.

The construction of the site generated more than 200 temporary jobs. Permanent positions have also been created for ongoing operations, contributing to the region’s economic integration. The facility is expected to generate several million USD in tax revenues for Milam County and the Thorndale Independent School District.

Local deployment supported by tax revenues

The anticipated revenues are expected to support school renovations and emergency services. The project includes material support for Thorndale Elementary School and an operational partnership with the local volunteer fire department, reinforcing the operator’s local presence.

The project comes at a time of increasing strain on the Texas power grid. The addition of a storage system allows energy produced during the day to be distributed during peak demand periods. This technical setup enhances grid reliability while improving the management of intermittent capacity.

A combined solar-storage deployment model

The integration of solar production and battery storage is an emerging model in the U.S. energy sector. It increases grid flexibility without relying on conventional thermal sources.

By strengthening its installations in the United States, RWE continues to deploy infrastructure designed to meet energy needs while expanding its operational portfolio in high-potential regions.

From government mandates to corporate overhauls, the Electric Vehicle (EV) revolution is no longer a distant reality but a full-blown truth. For Indian students, the shift represents not only technological change but also a powerful opportunity to build a meaningful and future-focused career.

The basics of the EV revolution

Electric vehicles (EVs) are transforming the automotive sector by replacing internal combustion engines with cleaner alternatives. They come in various forms and some of them are Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs), which run entirely on rechargeable batteries; Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) pair batteries with conventional engines; Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) use both but cannot be plugged in; and Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles generate electricity through hydrogen, emitting only water. Together, they represent diverse pathways to sustainable transport.

With governments worldwide driving policies for net-zero targets, EV adoption is accelerating—by 2025, one in five new cars sold globally is expected to be electric. Nations like India, the UK, and Ireland are not only cutting emissions but also unlocking opportunities in innovation, entrepreneurship, and green jobs.

EVs as career catalyst

The introduction of EVs is set to have a significant impact on various sectors, both directly and indirectly. Industries such as automotive, construction, energy, mining, chemical, battery manufacturing, and real estate are set to bear a profound direct impact. EV adoption is also encouraging major investments in charging infrastructure, energy storage, and sustainable design. Further, EVs can significantly impact international relations, global policies, and geopolitics. Given its strength, countries are preparing for the revolution EVs will bring.

The global landscape

The UK has committed to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and has become the first country to sign a legally binding contract for the same. Transport accounted for 29% of the UK’s total greenhouse gas emissions in 2023, making it the largest-emitting sector of the UK economy. Over half (54%) of the UK’s transport emissions come from cars and taxis. Therefore, the government plans to introduce EVs and ban the sale of Internal Combustion Engines (ICEs) by 2030. To support this shift, it’s investing £150 million in loans to SMEs for R&D and £90 billion across the sector. This will create a wide range of job roles, from sustainable infrastructure engineers to battery chemists and smart grid analysts.

Similarly, Ireland is also accelerating toward electrification, targeting 9,36,000 EVs on its roads by 2030, i.e., about a third of its total vehicles. Government grants, tax rebates, and charging infrastructure schemes are supporting this growth.

India, the 5th-largest auto manufacturer, will rise to 3rd place by 2030. With the net-zero target by 2070, India is aiming to accelerate EV adoption in commercial vehicles and private cars. This EV push could generate 10 million direct jobs and 50 million indirect jobs.

For Indian students, understanding the distinct approaches and innovations in these markets offers valuable cross-border insights and career direction.

India is rapidly positioning itself as a key player in the global EV transition, driven by government initiatives like FAME-II, state-level EV policies, and growing investments from both domestic and international automakers. With a strong push for local manufacturing, battery innovation, and charging infrastructure, the country is not only targeting mass adoption of electric two- and three-wheelers but also nurturing a talent pipeline through specialised courses and industry–academia collaborations. This evolving ecosystem underscores India’s ambition to become both a major EV market and a hub for innovation.

Where opportunities lie

As the electric vehicle (EV) revolution gains traction, the education sector is being called upon to evolve just as swiftly. Universities across the UK and Ireland are stepping up by introducing a mix of specialised, upskilling, and reskilling courses that align with the emerging needs of the EV industry. These programmes span multiple disciplines, equipping students with the knowledge and skills required for the mobility landscape of tomorrow.

The UK has emerged as a hub for EV-focused education, with universities introducing specialised postgraduate programmes to address the growing demand for green mobility talent. In the country’s automotive heartland, institutions are driving innovation through courses in vehicle technologies, hydrogen and fuel cell systems, power electronics, and connected autonomous vehicles. In other regions, programmes in smart grids, battery technologies, sustainable energy, and advanced materials are expanding the talent pool, and Ireland is too strengthening its academic offerings in this space.

Beyond automotive-specific degrees, universities are also nurturing EV-relevant skills through courses in control systems, automation, and power networks, while ensuring graduates are equipped to contribute across the wider energy and mobility ecosystem.

Ultimately, the EV revolution is about more than just transitioning away from internal combustion engines; it’s about reimagining the future of mobility in cleaner, smarter and more sustainable ways. It requires a new generation of engineers, designers, energy experts, and policy thinkers. For Indian students aiming for a global career in this dynamic sector, now is the time to explore these academic pathways, align with industry trends, and become part of a movement that is reshaping how the world moves.

Publication of the law on Tuesday (25) confirmed the signal given hours earlier by Mines and Energy Minister Alexandre Silveira during an interview on TV Cultura’s Roda Viva.

He argued that keeping the current methodology leads to a R$83 billion loss in federal revenue over ten years.
The organization is analyzing next steps but intends to lobby Congress to restore the approved wording.","High-profile items, such as compensation for generation curtailment and a change to the reference price for oil, were removed. The extension of coal-fired power plant contracts, however, was kept in place.

Publication of the law on Tuesday (25) confirmed the signal given hours earlier by Mines and Energy Minister Alexandre Silveira during an interview on TV Cultura’s Roda Viva. Silveira had indicated that the government would reject provisions that, in his view, threatened tariff stability and regulatory predictability.

The most sensitive veto targeted a broad compensation mechanism for wind and solar power plants in cases of curtailment caused by oversupply or lack of transmission capacity. The text had provided for retroactive payments, which, according to Silveira, could have generated a tariff impact of up to R$6 billion.

With the veto, companies will only be reimbursed for curtailment explicitly caused by inadequate infrastructure to evacuate energy. Other cases should be discussed later, the minister signaled during the interview.

Consumer groups had opposed the measure, while renewable-energy companies argued that the lack of a solution to manage curtailment-related costs threatens investments and jobs.

“We’re going to see more layoffs. We’re dealing with two crises: the micro-crisis, which is curtailment—this entire regulatory mess that needs fixing—and the macro-crisis, which is the broader industrial downturn, with factories closing and workers being dismissed,” said Elbia Gannoum, president of the Brazilian Wind Energy Association (ABEEOLICA).

Another veto struck the provision limiting new self-generation arrangements, an increasingly common strategy among large industrial consumers. The official justification argued that such restrictions would undermine the efficient use of installed capacity and create artificial barriers at a time when the government is attempting to reorganize the regulatory framework to attract new investment.

According to Raphael Gomes, an energy partner at law firm Lefosse, the original text limiting self-generation to new projects, under the logic of encouraging additional capacity, “runs counter to the facts, given that one of the sector’s biggest short-term problems is precisely generation curtailment due to insufficient demand to absorb existing supply.”

The extension of coal-fired plant contracts through 2040 was preserved. Some analysts viewed the decision as contradictory to federal energy policy, since it maintains subsidies for a high-emission source despite international pressure following COP30. The minister, however, argued that these plants remain necessary for system reliability.

For Nivalde de Castro, general coordinator of the Power Sector Study Group (Gesel) at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, the extension should have been vetoed from an energy-planning perspective. “This decision was largely political, tied to regional economic interests and pressure from lawmakers, a pattern that has become common and somewhat damaging to the power sector.”

In the oil and gas segment, the government ultimately vetoed the change to the reference price used for calculating royalties, an adjustment that would have increased federal revenues and had divided the industry and government officials.

Evaristo Pinheiro, president of Refina Brasil, said the veto is cause for concern. He argued that keeping the current methodology leads to a R$83 billion loss in federal revenue over ten years. The organization is analyzing next steps but intends to lobby Congress to restore the approved wording. “The measure does not create a tax, does not alter contracts, and simply ensures that the calculation prescribed in the Petroleum Law is correctly applied.”

The Brazilian Petroleum, Gas and Biofuels Institute (IBP) stated that maintaining the current calculation model “protects investments, preserves jobs, and provides legal certainty to existing contracts, aligning directly with the country’s development agenda.”

On the consumer side, União Pela Energia, a coalition of 70 industry associations and federations, considered the vetoes of articles deemed harmful to the power sector to be significant.",https://s2-valorinternational.glbimg.com/3RyRSyTKD8yFpAJyjtkFnmqe0vs=/1153x0/filters:format(jpeg)/https://i.s3.glbimg.com/v1/AUTH_63b422c2caee4269b8b34177e8876b93/internal_photos/bs/2025/5/P/0fB0I4QLimytzkHBoPIw/foto26bra-101-energia-a8.jpg,N,,2025-11-27 08:00:27.740657

#India #REPM #MagnetManufacturing #EVIndia #CleanEnergy #WindPower #DefenceIndia #Electronics #AtmanirbharBharat #MadeinIndia #PMModi #Startuppedia","The Indian government has approved a ₹7,280 crore plan to build the country’s first full setup for producing sintered Rare Earth Permanent Magnets (REPM).

The announcement was shared online by PM Narendra Modi, who called it “a historic first for India’s high-tech manufacturing.”

REPMs are strong magnets used in EV motors, wind power units, satellites, aircraft systems, missiles and many electronic products. India currently imports most of these magnets.

With EV sales rising and renewable energy expanding, the demand for REPMs is growing quickly. Heavy dependence on imports can lead to shortages and higher prices.

Only a few countries produce most of the world’s supply, which increases the risk for Indian companies. Building local production can give India better control and more stability.

The plan aims to create 6,000 MTPA of REPM output. This covers the full chain, from converting rare earth oxides into metals to forming alloys and then making finished magnets.

Having the entire system inside the country is expected to give manufacturers a steady flow of material as they grow in high-tech areas.

The announcement also said the step would help improve self-reliance and support clean energy goals.

The scheme offers ₹6,450 crore in sales linked incentives for a five year period and ₹750 crore in capital support to help companies set up factories.

The government will pick five companies through a global bidding process. Each selected company may receive approval to produce up to 1,200 MTPA.

The full plan will run for seven years. The first two years are for construction and setup, followed by five years of incentive payouts.

The goal is to secure a local supply of rare earth magnets so that industries such as EVs, wind power, defence and advanced electronics do not depend as heavily on imports.

The plan is also expected to support new jobs and give Indian companies a more stable path for future growth.

The company made a Class 4 electric truck chassis with a cab–over design.

Emails sent by the company’s HR boss show that Bollinger missed payroll for the last two pay periods.

Bollinger Motors, the maker of the B4 Class 4 electric truck, is out of business. Emails sent by the company’s human resources director and seen by the Detroit Free Press say that the Michigan-based startup’s last day of operations was last Friday.

""We received word late last night that the day has arrived, we are to officially close the doors of Bollinger Motors, effective today, November 21st, 2025,"" Helen Watson, Bollinger’s HR chief, said in an email.

Bollinger's first vehicles were the B1 and B2, but neither went into production.

The company sprang into the spotlight in the late 2010s with the boxy B1 and B2 electric pickup and SUV, but neither model went into production. Instead, Mullen Automotive bought a controlling stake in the startup in 2022, and the entity started working on a Class 4 cab-over electric truck chassis.

However, the business never took off, and Bollinger found itself in the crosshairs of multiple lawsuits and financing woes. The startup’s founder, Robert Bollinger, left the company in March and sued parent company Mullen Automotive over a $10 million loan he gave last year, alleging that the startup was broke.

That passed, as Mullen paid back Bollinger. But other issues made their presence felt. Lawsuits from suppliers came and went, with six active cases from companies like Germany’s Thyssenkrupp and Brazil’s Metalsa still being on the Oakland County Circuit Court’s agenda, according to Automotive News.

Michery, the CEO of Mullen Automotive, took over as the leader of Bollinger Motors in June and put both companies under the “Bollinger Innovations” umbrella. While the entity that made the Bollinger B4 electric truck has closed, Bollinger Innovations is still open for business, the Detroit Free Press noted.

The B4 electric truck was Bollinger's first and only production model.

Dozens of employees have filed complaints over unpaid wages, and the state of Michigan is bound to fight over millions of dollars from the struggling EV maker after it failed to reach job milestones. Bollinger was awarded $3 million from the Michigan Economic Development Corp. after it promised to invest $44 million and create 237 jobs in Detroit’s metro area. As of September 30, the startup had no qualified new jobs and 50 base employees, according to a MEDC spokesperson, who added that Bollinger had until May 4 to fix the default by reaching job milestones. It “will be required to pay back all or a portion of those funds” if that doesn’t happen, Danielle Emerson said for Automotive News.

With the company out of business, that’s unlikely to happen now. As for the unpaid wages, Bollinger’s HR director said that David Michery, the CEO of Bollinger Innovations, will “make us whole with regards to the remaining monies.” ""It is the end of an era, but one you should all be very proud of,"" she added.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/nAb616/s1/2025-bollinger-b4.jpg,N,,2025-11-27 03:59:09.676662
